ROBERT C. OGDEN MEMORIAL MEETING. 
Tables of statistics are sometimes said to be dry and uninteresting, but for 
all students of education and for those who believe in the education of the 
people as the most important factor in the progress of the country, the figures 
given below will have interest enough. To those not acquainted with recent 
progress in public education in the southern States, they may appear in- 
credible. In the order given they indicate for the several southern States 
the per cent. of illiteracy among the white children between the ages of ten . 
and twenty for the years 1900, 1910 and 1914. The figures for the decennial 
years are taken from the report of the Census Bureau. Those for the present 
year are estimated, but are, I believe, reasonably accurate.

The per cent. of illiteracy among the white children of these States be- 
tween the ages of ten and twenty is less than half that of fourteen years ago. 
The figures are eloquent of earnest, persistent, effective endeavor and of 
hope for the future. The figures for the reduction of illiteracy among the 
colored children between these ages would be still more astounding. 
The number of days in the annual school term in these States is still small 
enough, but the increase for all the States for 1900 to 1912 was from 105 to 
130 days, a gain of twenty-five days. For the several States the increase in 
days was as follows: 
Virginia, 120 to 140; West Virginia, 106 to 137; North Carolina, 71 to 109; 
South Carolina, 88 to 92; Georgia, 112 to 142; Florida, 93 to 122; Alabama, 
78 to 132; Mississippi, 101 to 123; Louisiana, 120 to 132; Texas, 108 to 132; 
Arkansas, 77 to 118; Oklahoma, 95 to 130; Tennessee, 96 to 128; Kentucky, 
117 to 139. 
Within the fourteen years from 1900 until now, the expenditure for public 
schools in these States has increased from $23,000,000 to $82,000,000, an 
increase of 256 per cent. The expenditure per capita for the total population 
in 1900, was $1.10; in 1914 it is approximately $2.75. The value of public 
school property has increased from $40,000,000 to approximately $175,000,- 
000, an increase of 337 per cent. The character of school houses has been 
improved more than in any hundred years before. Women’s clubs, school 
improvement leagues, and civic societies have co-operated with school of- 
ficials to make schoolhouses and grounds more beautiful, comfortable, sani- 
tary and attractive. 
Probably the most remarkable progress in public education in these States 
in the last dozen years has been in the high schools. The number of these 
schools has increased beyond all precedent. Their attendance has doubled, 
and doubled again. Their standards have been raised, and they are rapidly 
taking their rightful place as the heart and centre of the public school system. 
The high schools of cities and towns have extended their course from two or 
three years to the standard four years, and hundreds of good high schools 
have been opened free to the boys and girls of the small villages and open 
country. The influence of these schools has already been felt throughout the 
entire system of elementary and higher education and in the life of the com- 
munities to which they minister. 
Since the people have begun to spend-more money on their schools they 
have become more concerned about the preparation of teachers. In all these
-P-A-G-E-9
  PROCEEDINGS S: 
States they are beginning now to understand at least something of the prin- 
ciple which Dr. J. L. M. Curry never tired of reiterating, to-wit: That any 
State which undertakes to educate the children of the people at public ex- 
pense must also assume the accompanying responsibility of preparing at 
public expense, the teachers for the schools, in order that the time and money 
of the children may not be frittered away and that they may not, through the 
inefficiency of their teachers, finally be cheated out of the opportunity which 
the State would provide for their education. All these States now have nor- 
mal schools, some of them four or five each, and many of the schools are well 
supported. Several of these States, as Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, 
and Arkansas, have established their first normal schools within the last 
five or six years, and all have largely increased their appropriations for the 
better support and equipment of these schools. 
Beginning with the first session of the Summer School of the South at 
Knoxville, in 1902, there has been a remarkable increase in the number and 
size of high-grade summer schools for teachers, until now nearly half the 
teachers of these States attend some good summer school from four to ten 
weeks each year. 
Only less remarkable than the progress in secondary education has been the 
progress in higher education. Colleges, universities, and technical and pro- 
fessional schools have increased largely in equipment, support, efficiency 
and attendance. Standards have been raised and made more definite both 
for admission and for graduation. 
Schools of all grades and kinds have modified and differentiated their 
curricula and courses of study to meet the demands of modern life and the 
varying needs of their students. They are now seeking the means of serving 
their communities, large or small, beyond their walls, by various forms of 
extension work. 
Clearly, a new era in education has begun for this section which wandered 
so long in its wilderness of poverty and uncertainty in the years following the 
destruction of war and reconstruction. An era of democracy in education 
and for democracy is upon us. A people in want and uncertain of the 
means of relief have begun to realize that the only help for any people is 
to help them to help themselves, and that this help can come only through 
right edueation. Men and women indifferent, and even antagonistic, to 
public education at public expense, have come to look upon the education of 
all the people as the highest function and first duty of the democratic State 
and to regard provision for the support of the schools of the people the most 
important task of the statesman. 
The Conference for Education in the South, which began its work in a small 
way at Capon Springs two years before the beginning of this century, and held 
its first public meeting at Winston-Salem, N. C., in the second year of the 
century, has been beyond question one of the most important single factors 
in the remarkable awakening and progress which I have here briefly recounted. 
Some day, when the history of this movement has been adequately written, 
this will be seen more clearly than is now possible. We are still too close to 
the events to catch the perspective. 
At the time of the Winston-Salem Conference I was a teacher in the State
-P-A-G-E-10
  
6 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
Normal and Industrial College at Greensboro, N. C. As a man interested 
in the promotion of education in North Carolina, I had been invited to attend 
the Capon Springs Conferences, but had not been able to do so. Hence I was 
ignorant, as most men and women in the south were at that time, as to the 
real nature and purpose of the Conference and of just what was expected to 
be accomplished by the meeting at Winston-Salem. But the whole thing had 
a fascination for me from the hour when Mr. Ogden’s special train with his 
three or four-score of invited guests stopped at Greensboro until the end of 
the last session of the Conference in the quaint Moravian Church house in 
Salem. In Mr. Ogden’s party were many men and women whose names 
were known to us and to all the world for their achievements, but whose faces 
were unfamiliar to most of us. From the south came men who in their States 
and local communities, were known for their interest in education and for 
their leadership in the new movement for democracy in education. When 
these men and women from the north and south met through those three 
days in the North Carolina “Twin Cities” to learn to know each other and to 
discuss the problems of education in the south as seen from their different 
points of view, the hour of opportunity had struck. From that hour to this, 
the movement in the interest of which these people had come together has 
gone steadily on with increasing momentum and increasing definiteness of 
purpose and aims. 
I wish I might picture for you the meetings in the Moravian Church as I 
saw them, and sum up for you in a few words the pregnant addresses to which 
we listened. Charles W. Dabney, at that time president of the University of 
Tennessee, made his strong plea for the education of the people as the surest 
and only means to the solution of all our problems of industrial, economic, 
social, civic and political life, declaring that in a democracy like ours all things 
wait on education, and laying special emphasis on the relation of the right 
education of the people to the production of wealth. 
The only possible principle of helpful co-operation between the north and the 
south was set forth clearly by Dr. George 8. Dickerman, of New Haven, who, 
quoting the injunction of Jesus to his disciples when he sent them on their 
mission to the neighboring cities and towns, declared that under the condi- 
tions then existing, men and women of means in the north wishing to help 
the south should follow the lead and accept the advice of intelligent southern 
men and women, who must needs know better than any foreigner could 
how to appeal to the southern people and to arouse them to the sense of their 
needs and to change their individual isolation into community co-operation. 
This principle then set forth by Dr. Dickerman has been the working policy 
of the Conference and of the Southern Education Board from then until 
now. 
Charles B. Aycock, the educational governor of North Carolina, spoke in 
eloquent phrase of the south’s needs for educational statesmanship. Charles 
D. Melver, in his own inimitable, energetic way, urged the need of the State 
for the fullest development of all its citizens. Edwin A. Alderman, in his 
felicitous phrase, declared that a child has the same right to be educated 
that it has to stand unhindered beneath the bending skies. William H. 
Baldwin urged the nation’s interest in the right education of the people of
-P-A-G-E-11
        PROCEEDINGS 
pure-blooded native American stock in the southern States, and also of the 
right education of the negro. Dr. J. L. M. Curry recounted the south’s past 
and lifted the veil of the future for a prophetic view of the progress, much of 
which we now see more clearly in retrospect. 
Robert C. Ogden, with his broad vision, genial nature, and ready wit, was 
the president and the soul of the Conference, and won the hearts of us all. 
I remember how, when, to relieve the strain of a long session, he asked the 
audience to stand and sing “America,” and someone asked why might not 
the windows be raised to let in the air, Mr. Ogden replied, ‘The air is in 
the song, of course,” and so it was, and is. There were others—many others 
—who spoke earnestly and wisely, but these I remember best now. 
Before the Conference adjourned, a resolution was adopted providing for 
the formation of a committee or board to be known as the Executive Board 
of the Conference for Education in the South. Mr. Ogden, as president, 
named the following members of the Board: J. L. M. Curry, Charles W. Dab- 
ney, Edwin A. Alderman, Charles D. McIver, Hollis B. Frissell, Wallace 
Buttrick, George Foster Peabody. The Board was authorized to increase 
its membership if it appeared to be desirable to do so. Before the end of the 
year the committee had organized itself into the “Southern Education Board,” 
adding to its members William H. Baldwin, Jr., Albert Shaw, Walter H. Page, 
and H. H. Hanna. Robert C. Ogden was chosen president of the Board, 
and held the position until his death. Other names have been added from 
time to time, but the Board has never been large. I believe it has never 
had more than twenty-one members at any one time. For more than half of 
the period of its existence it has been my good fortune to be a member of the 
Board, and I have known intimately of its actions and of its policies from the 
beginning, having been one of its first employees. 
The Board has never had any endowment, and its income has been limited 
to only a few thousand dollars a year, but these thousands have been used 
very wisely. I think no body of men with so small means at their disposal 
has ever accomplished so much of fundamental value for this section. The 
Board has given away no money, nor has it attempted to endow any insti- 
tutions. It has used its small means only to make it possible for earnest and 
able men of the south, interested in education, to induce the southern people 
themselves to undertake to improve their schools by their own means. Several 
years ago a careful estimate showed that for every dollar expended by the 
Board in one of the southern States, the people of the State had themselves 
given several thousands of dollars and were still giving $300 a year. The 
ratio is now much greater. 
Out of the Conference for Education in the South and the work of the 
Southern Education Board—which, as just related, grew out of the Winston- 
Salem meeting—have come many other agencies and movements which 
are now working for the welfare of this section. The General Education 
Board, with its millions of endowment, grew out of the Conferences and the 
Southern Education Board. The southern States have had their full share 
of the large contributions made annually by this Board to colleges, universities 
and professional schools. The recent movement for the establishment and 
improvement of public high schools in the southern States was made possible
-P-A-G-E-12
  8 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
by the General Education Board when it gave to the several States money 
for the employment of professors of secondary education in the State univer- 
sities and inspectors of high schools in connection with the State departments 
of education. The Board has also made it possible for these men to work 
to better advantage by bringing them together from time to time to discuss 
their problems and exchange experiences. 
The General Education Board began the farm demonstration work in the 
southern States under the direction of Dr. Seaman A. Knapp, and later 
through co-operation with the Department of Agriculture of the United States 
has extended this to all of the communities of most of the southern States. 
I believe this Board is contributing now to this purpose nearly $300,000 a 
year. The Federal Government is giving a much larger sum, and is just 
beginning to extend the work to the other States of the union. Possibly no 
other one educational agency has done so much for the economic welfare of 
the rural communities and of the people of the entire section. Closely re- 
lated to the farm demonstration work is the work of the corn clubs for boys 
and canning clubs for girls, which have been organized and directed through 
the co-operation of the General Education Board. Through the farm demon- 
stration work the man on the farm is learning to make more than two blades 
of grass grow where only one grew before. Boys still in their teens are making 
their selected acres of land produce larger yields of corn than had ever been 
known in this or any other part of the United States. The girls in the canning 
clubs are re-establishing for this section the forgotten connection between 
the home and the home garden. 
The Conference and the Southern Education Board started the work for 
school improvement in the southern States which for many years received 
a large part of the attention of the Conference and Board. School improve- 
ment workers in the several States, paid by small appropriations from the 
Board supplemented by local funds, have organized in all these States many 
leagues for the improvement of schoolhouses and grounds, for the establish- 
ment of school libraries, and for the lengthening of school terms. They have 
worked for the beautification of schoolrooms and for the better sanitation 
of the schoolhouse and grounds. Their motto, ‘For our schools, health, 
comfort and beauty,” has now become the ideal of citizens and school officials. 
Through the persistent efforts of the school improvement workers and the 
large numbers of men and women brought together in the school improve- 
ment leagues, an intelligent interest in schools and school affairs has been 
disseminated among the masses of the people with a swiftness and sureness 
which would have been otherwise impossible. 
It was at a meeting of the Southern Education Board that plans were 
first discussed and formulated for the organization of the Rockefeller Sani- 
tary Commission for the Eradication of the Hookworm Disease, which has 
called the attention of the people of the south to this disease, from which so 
many millions were suffering unconsciously, and has already done so much 
toward its extermination. The influence of the work of this commission has 
gone far beyond the limits indicated by its name. Probably more than any 
other agency it is responsible for the attention now given to sanitation and 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
  PROCEEDINGS 9 
prevention of all forms of communicable and filth diseases in these States. 
The work of the commission is now becoming world-wide. 
The campaigns of education for education, have, in all the southern States, 
enlisted the co-operation of teachers, school officers, farmers, politicians, 
publicists, business men, and men and women of all professions, as nothing 
else within the last forty years has done. Hundreds of mass meetings have 
been held in all the States. In some of the States central mass meetings, 
attended by many thousands of people, have been held in all of the counties, 
with smaller meetings in the local districts. Thousands of addresses have 
been made; tens of thousands of newspaper columns have been devoted to 
the discussion of public education. Within the brief space of a decade, the 
mass of the people have had their attention attracted to this subject and 
have learned more of it than in a century before. 
The horizons of school officials have been widened by the annual excur- 
sions to different parts of the country made by the State superintendents of 
public instruction at the expense of the Southern Education Board and under 
the direction of Mr. Ogden. One of these excursions was for the purpose 
of studying the rural schools of the middle west, the beginnings of agriculture 
in the secondary schools, and the agricultural extension work of the University 
of Wisconsin. Another had for its object the study of school consolidation 
in Indiana and elsewhere. A third was to New England and New York for 
the study of State systems of education. These excursions have contributed 
also to the re-making of school laws and school systems, and indirectly to 
the appointment of rural school inspectors and supervisors for the better 
supervision and direction of the rural school work. Comparison of actual 
school work in different parts of the country with the work of the schools of 
their own States, as known to the State superintendents, resulted in a keen 
appreciation of the need for different and better preparation on the part of 
the teacher. Out of the feeling of this need has grown the reconstruction of 
the Peabody College, which, with its larger endowment and under its new 
direction, has an opportunity to become the most important agent in the re- 
direction of school ideals and practices in the southern States. 
Mr. Ogden’s personal interest in these excursions of school superintendents 
was very great. It was a rare sight, that of the great merchant prince, long 
accustomed to the direction of thousands of employees and the responsibility 
for the management of a business involving hundreds of millions of dollars, 
in his old age spending weeks of his time on chartered Pullman cars, going 
from city to city and from State to State with these superintendents of public 
instruction from the south, inspecting universities and colleges, listening to 
recitations in schoolrooms, visiting isolated one-room country schools on the 
plains of the west, and discussing with teachers, school officers and citizens 
their local school interests, for the sake of gaining for himself and those re- 
sponsible for the direction of the policies of education in the south such wis- 
dom as might thus be had. 
The meetings of the Southern Education Board at the summer home of 
Mr. Peabody on Lake George, and later in New York City or with Mr. Page 
at Garden City, have also been unique—groups of business men of large 
financial interests, professional men called for brief periods from their offices,  
-P-A-G-E-14
  10 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
editors of great magazines, directors of large manufacturing plants and 
mercantile firms, conferring with college presidents, school superintendents 
and teachers, and listening for eight or ten hours a day through a period of 
several days at a time to detailed and lengthy reports of the building of school- 
houses and the levying of taxes for the support of schools, with an interest 
unsurpassed by that with which these same men managed their financial and 
business affairs, and with which some of them have since managed the affairs 
of the nation. 
The annual meetings of the Conference for Education in the South have 
themselves had their unique interest as educational gatherings, and have 
played a most important part in our educational progress. Some of them 
have been great mass meetings, as at Richmond and Lexington. Some 
have been small assemblies for intensive and intimate discussion, as at 
Pinehurst. Some have combined: both features, their programs providing 
both for the larger mass meetings and for the smaller conferences, as begun 
by Rose at Little Rock, and brought to such a high degree of perfection by 
Bourland at Richmond and in this Conference here in Louisville. 
The Conference has shown the way to a new kind of educational discussion. 
The programs of the meetings of most educational associations and con- 
ferences contain the names of only men and women directly connected with 
the schools. The programs of the Conference for Education in the South 
contain the names of governors, bishops and other dignitaries of the church, 
legislators, merchants, physicians, manufacturers, farmers, lawyers, teachers, 
leaders of women’s clubs, officers of farmers’ unions, and other agricultural 
societies, and men and women with no claim to recognition except their deep 
interest in education and the improvement of the schools of their communities. 
From these programs might be made a somewhat comprehensive list of the 
ablest men and women in the present generation, both north and south. The 
subjects discussed have not been the ordinary subjects of school organiza- 
tion, discipline, courses of study, and methods of teaching usually discussed 
at educational gatherings. They have pertained to greater production, better 
use of the products of the soil, better homes, better health conditions, and a 
larger freedom. The motto held consciously or unconsciously has ever been, 
“Let us help the people to help themselves.” 
The results have been a broader, saner conception of democracy, the break- 
ing down of prejudices through bringing together from the north and south 
men and women who make opinion and direct sentiment. 
The heart and soul of the Conference, and under God above all others the 
leader and inspirer of the movement, has been a simple, honest, lovable, 
great man, Robert C. Ogden. His annual addresses as president of the Con- 
ference have inspired us all to better things. His masterful and inimitable 
presiding, his wit and good cheer, his self-sacrifice, his patience, his interest 
in details, can never be forgotten. His benediction rests on this Conference 
and all ‘its work. Whatever their first impressions and attitudes toward 
the Conference and its work, all who knew Mr. Ogden came to love him. 
His memory will long be cherished by thousands of the people of the south, 
and the lives of millions who may never hear his name spoken will be richer 
and fuller because he lived.

PROCEEDINGS 11 
RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE SOUTHERN EDUCATION 
BOARD 
IN COMMEMORATION OF 
MR. ROBERT C. OGDEN, 
President, 1901-1913. 
The Southern Education Board approaches with hesitation and with rever- 
ence the duty of placing on its records a tribute to the memory of Robert C. 
Ogden. No words can fittingly express the sentiments of respect and regard 
felt toward him by the members of this body, or their estimate of his value 
as a man and as a citizen. To an extent unusual in any organization he 
incarnated the whole Board. He was its organizer and its only president 
during the years of his life. It was his high conception of duty and privilege 
that held the Board to its task and rendered the results of its labors so re- 
markably successful. He mapped the course, he led the way, he inspirited 
each follower, and by his life and death he consecrated the work. 
A review of the years passed shows that the activities of this Board have 
been directed to various ends—to educational campaigns that have aroused. 
one State after another, to needed changes in educational legislation, to general 
improvement in rural schools, and to the elevation of rural life. Rarely has 
any work so far-reaching been originated and carried through with so small 
an outlay of material resources. The wisdom of those who have directed 
these activities has been justified by wonderful results. Mr. Ogden was 
responsible for the selection of these workers. His insight recognized the 
tasks and chose the agents best suited for their accomplishment. By the 
power of his personal influence he held the Southern Board together, and 
directed the energies of busy men to the unselfish duties which he assumed. 
That same wonderful personality impressed itself upon the nation at large. 
Through the Conference for Education in the South, he touched the great 
hearts of the North and the South, and put upon the nation’s conscience 
a universal need. All this was done so quietly, so simply, that we wonder 
still at the results. Not by persuasion, not by fanatical insistence, but by the 
contagion of his own personal devotion, he rallied men from every section, 
from every walk or station in life, rich and poor, high and lowly, white and 
black, to the cause which he advocated. 
The South owes him a peculiar debt. He understood the temper and tem- 
perament of its people. He admired its strength, and was kind in his judg- 
ment of weaknesses. He understood its problems and sought a rational solu- 
tion of them. Not by patronizing aloofness and cold counsel, but by personal 
aid and warm sympathy, he made his contributions to the uplift of a whole 
nation. 
Through his efforts our national life has been strengthened, brothers once 
estranged have become united, service feebly performed has been rendered 
efficient, and racial co-operation has taken the place of racial conflicts. 
Robert C. Ogden was a man of high ideals and far-reaching vision. To 
great purposes he consecrated his life with a devotion unsurpassed. By the 
 
-P-A-G-E-16

compelling power of personal friendship, he lifted others to the high plane 
on which he lived, and joined other hands to his in noblest service. 
Therefore, we, the members of the Southern Education Board, dedicate 
to him these pages in our records. The written words but feebly attest our 
love and our loss. The record of his life is the best part of our institutional 
history. His memory is an inspiration, the consciousness of his continued 
love and friendship our comfort still, his work the foundation on which we 
must forever build. Who seeks his monument will find it both in national 
achievement and in the consecration of many hearts. 
To the God of the nations, we render thanks for the life and for the memory 
of Robert C. Ogden. 
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS 
CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 
LOUISVILLE, KY., APRIL 10, 1914. 
Resolved: 1. Since the last meeting of this Conference, its beloved President, 
generous benefactor, wise guide, Robert C. Ogden, has fallen on sleep and has 
left in our work a vacant place that can never be filled, in our lives an uplift- 
ing influence that shall never cease, in our hearts a sorrow and sense of loss 
that must be left unexpressed because inexpressable.

extension of its work, as the best expression of our gratitude for his unselfish 
service to us, and the fittest memorial to him. 
3. That we favor the consolidation of the Southern Educational Associa- 
tion with the Conference for Education in the South, in the interest of economy 
of time and expense, and of the unity and correlation of all the related agencies 
heretofore included in both of these bodies, into one great annual co-opera- 
tive Conference. 
4, That we recommend the appointment of a committee of three, consist- 
ing of the Chairman of the Executive Committee of this Conference, and two 
other members of that Committee, to be named by him to confer with a similar 
committee of the Southern Educational Association, for the arrangement of 
the details of the consolidation of the two bodies, and that this committee 
be vested with full authority to act for this Conference in all matters pertain- 
taining to the consolidation of the two bodies and the fixing of the time, 
the place and the program of the next meeting. 
5. That we desire to express our sincere appreciation of the services and 
tireless work of the Executive Secretary of this Conference, in the arrange- 
ment and successful execution of the varied, comprehensive and unusually 
interesting and profitable program this year. 
5. That we tender our thanks to the State Department of Education and the

A Country Community. 
OrGanizEp To Epucats AND To Dryetop IrsELr. 
THE ARMORY, APRIL 7, 8, 9, 10, 1914. 
A country community, organized and at work to educate and to develop 
itself, was depicted through a series of exhibits and conferences in the Armory, 
at the Conference for Education in the South, held at Louisville, Ky., April 
to 10. 
Entering, to the right one found a farmers’ club in session, under the 
direction of Prof. A. D. Wilson, of the University of- Minnesota, and Mr. 
C. E. Bassett, of the Bureau of Markets, U.S. Department of Agriculture, with 
the assistance of Messrs. W. F. Ward and J. H. Arnold, of the Department 
of Agriculture, and Prof. William Hill, of Bethany College, West Virginia. 
To the rear, a country church was meeting, reorganizing itself for active 
work in country-life development, under the direction of Rev. Frank M. 
Thomas, of Kentucky, and Rev. W. H. Mills, of South Carolina, and Miss 
Jessie Field, of the National Committee of the Y. W. C. A. 
Upstairs the rural school was in actual session, showing how the farm 
activities can be made the central factors in the school work, and how the 
technics—writing, drawing, figuring, reading, and so on—can be related to 
these activities, under the direction of Mrs. Hetty S. Browne and -Miss 
Margaret Whittemore, of Winthrop College, South Carolina, and Prof. J. S. 
Pullen, of the State Normal College, Richmond, Ky. 
Passing through the great hall and turning to the right, one saw the building 
of the country home and its silo, along with the necessary sanitary features, 
set forth through lantern illustrations and demonstrations by Messrs. W. A. 
Etherton and J. H. McClain, of the Department of Agriculture, and Dr. 
A. T. McCormick, secretary of the State Board of Health in Kentucky. 
Nearby, the work of the rural nurse was shown by Miss Florence D. Fuller, 
of the Red Cross Country-Nursing Service in Virginia, with the aid of a 
series of large pictures and charts, furnished by the National Red Cross 
Society. 
Close by was the equipment needed for putting running water into the 
country home, shown by President Joe. Cook, of the State Normal College, 
of Mississippi. 
Then came a kitchen with demonstrations of actual cooking and serving of 
typical meals by Miss Mary E. Sweeny, of the University of Kentucky, 
and Miss Frances G. Heverlo, of the State Normal College at Richmond, 
Ky.

Next came the country home itself, built and equipped, according to the 
plans worked out by W. A. Etherton, Department of Agriculture, under the 
direction of Miss Mary E. Frayser, of Winthrop College, South Carolina, 
where demonstrations in household management were conducted under her 
. direction, with the co-operation of Miss Agnes Harris, of the State College 
for Women, Tallahassee, Fla. 
Nearby was an exhibit of textile work from the sewing department of the 
University of Kentucky. 
The series closed with the demonstration of household industries—weaving, 
basket making, woodworking, and so on—under the direction of Prof. J. E. 
Smith and a number of co-workers from Berea College, Kentucky. 
Passing to the left, one saw a modern poultry house, with fowls from the 
Kentucky Experiment Station, along with model nests and other equipment, 
together with a giant incubator for community breeding, all of which were 
used in the demonstration sessions of the Co-operative Egg and Poultry 
Association, under the direction of Prof. J. K. Morrison, Agricultural College, 
Mississippi; Mr. Harry W. Lamon, U. 8. Department of Agriculture; Prof. 
J. J. Hooper, Kentucky Experiment Station; and Mr..H. W. Rickey, State 
demonstration agent in Kentucky. 
The remaining part of the left side of the great Armory was occupied with 
the exhibits and demonstrations of the boys’ and girls’ club work, under the 
direction of Mr. O. B. Martin, agent in charge, Department of Agriculture, 
and co-workers from different Southern States. The exhibits included ten 
ears of corn and a canning exhibit from each State. At the various sessions 
methods of organization of clubs for boys and girls were set forth through 
conferences and through actual demonstrations. 
The Louisville trophy, offered to the State which produced the ten best 
records for corn-club work, was awarded to Alabama. The ten boys in the 
winning team produced 1,718.3 bushels of corn on ten acres, at an average 
cost of 18 cents per bushel, or $31.73 per acre. The average profit was $140.14 
each. 
The trophy for the best ten records in the girls’ club work was awarded to 
Mississippi. The girls in the winning team produced 27,850 pounds of 
tomatoes from the ten and one-tenth-acre garden. From this quantity, in 
addition to the tomatoes used in the homes, there were canned 29,372 cans. 
The total value was $1,298.34, and the total profit $848.66. 
In the spacious galleries officials and other leaders interested in farmers’ 
co-operative associations, gave detailed instruction on the best means of 
forming and conducting organizations for both buying and selling. 
One group worked out ways and means of organizing and conducting fruit- 
selling associations, under the direction of Mr. W. M. McDonald, of Excelsior, 
Minn. 
The next group dealt with the problem of co-operative purchase of farm 
requirements, under the direction of Prof. J. N. Harper, Clemson College, 
South Carolina; Dr. J. C. Robert, Agricultural College, Mississippi; Prof. 
Chas. A. Keffer, University of Tennessee; Prof. J. F. Duggar, Agricultural 
College of Alabama; W. H. Alderman, University of West Virginia; and Prof. 
T. R. Bryant, University of Kentucky.

The next group was a co-operative stock selling association, working out 
ways and means of conducting its business, under the direction of Mr. Theo- 
dore Sexauer, of Wisconsin, and Mr. George M. Rommel, of the Bureau of 
Animal Industry, U. 8. Department of Agriculture. 
Passing further, one came to the group working out plans for a community 
stock-breeders’ association, under the direction of Prof. G. C. Humphrey, 
of the University of Wisconsin, and Prof. Archibald Smith, of the Mississippi 
Agricultural College. 
Further on Mr. W. A. Grover and Mr. Will Head, of Lavalle, Wis., told 
farmers how to organize and conduct an association to sell farm products. 
In the next corner a group gathered around Mr. E. A. Richardson, of Sparta, 
Wis:, was learning how to organize and conduct an association for handling 
small fruits, strawberries, and so on. 
So, under this vast roof, at a glance, one could see the essential factors of 
an organized country community, each busy at its task. 
The afternoons were given up to conferences of farmers, country women, 
country preachers, country doctors, school workers, and business men, each- 
grappling with some phase of the rural problem. 
In addition to these, mass meetings were held both at noon and in the eve- 
ning, dealing with questions of general interest. 
The aim of all the demonstrations and conferences was to get at the most 
effective means of community organization. Leaders from all the Southern 
and many of the Northern States, took part in the conference.—Rural School

A Demonstration of a New Type of Rural School. 
This demonstration showed how a school with three teachers can become 
an effective agency for community development. The Winthrop Farm School, 
at Rock Hill, 8. C., Mrs. Hetty 8. Browne, Principal, was used as a nucleus. 
Here the farming activity is the central factor to which drawing, reading, 
writing, numbers, etc., are organically related. 
Demonstrating teachers: Agriculture, J. S. Pullen, Richmond, Ky.; 
Domestic Science, Miss Whittemore, Winthrop College; Elemental Arts and 
Crafts, Mrs. Browne, who also acted as principal. 
Economic Farmhouses. 
By W. A. Erxerton, 
Architect in charge of farm structures, U. S. Department of Agriculture. 
A PROBLEM OF FARM ECONOMICS. 
| 
| 
Farmhouse problems constitute one of the most important phases of farm 
economics. No othef concerns more vitally the mental and physical fitness 
of the laborers for efficient service, whether the work is within the house or 
in the fields; but they affect most those for whom the house is a workshop by 
day as well as a shelter at night. 
Tue FarmHovuse NEGLECTED. 
These problems are now of greater importance than ever before because of 
their longer neglect and their complex relations to modern social, civic, and 
ethical conditions. The house has failed to share as it should in the improve- 
ments of the farm, and the average American farm-home of today is a rebuke 
to our boasted civilization and our agricultural education. 
Our: ancestors were relatively better provided for. Their log cabins were 
planned for fireplace cooking and other household duties peculiar to frontier 
life. Built from the largest trees of the forests and with stones from the creeks 
and the hillsides, these buildings withstood the foes of the woods and the 
storms of generations. They were, architecturally, in harmony with the trees, 
the hills, and the rocks about them. 
When the frontier of our western civilization emerged from the woods on 
to the wind-swept plains, the conditions to be contended with there were 
greatly changed. Without the forests for material and for shelter from the 
wind and sun, the pioneer could not build as he had learned to do in the woods, 
or copy from a nearby town as is done today. He was thrown upon his 
own resources and of necessity found upon the spot the material for his 
building. When his sod or adobe hut was done, he enjoyed an immunity 
   
-P-A-G-E-24
  20 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
from the hot sun and a protection from the winds that is impossible in the 
flimsy shacks now so common on the plains. 
When the forests disappeared under the woodmen’s axe and the cultivated 
fields brought a competence to the Colonial farmers, the log houses gave way 
to others better adapted to the altered landscape and to the more settled in- 
dustrial and social conditions of farm communities. Unhampered by pre- 
cedents, these farmers built again with the materials at hand and as well as 
they knew for the needs of Colonial life. How well they knew and how well 
they designed and built is evidenced by the fact that many of these farm- 
houses are yet intact after more than a century’s use and they are admired 
by the nation, as its best examples of domestic architecture. 
Colonial architecture was the fortunate and happy result of a higher ap- 
preciation of the value of farmhouses than obtains today and of an intelligent 
effort to build such houses to serve every requirement of the home. 
“Planned for the exact needs of the owners, they have no unnecessary 
features and typify in their good proportions and sturdy outline the char- 
acter of the men and women who lived in them.” 
Agriculture has been revolutionized since Colonial days and country life 
greatly changed, but many of the farmhouses planned and built more than 
a hundred years ago, when house servants were plentiful, are still in use. 
The better examples are admired for their architectural beauty, but, because 
of a lack of modern improvements in plan and equipment, they fail to minister 
as of old, to the needs of the family. 
Many of the log houses in the middle west, which served their builders 
so well and seemed so much akin to the trees and the rocks about them—now 
appear lonely in their barren isolation on the roadside and they serve in- 
adequately the needs of the present owners. Some of these relics of older 
days have been concealed under a veneer of weather boarding, their huge 
fireplaces have been boarded up and two or three rooms added in an attempt 
to modernize the old structures and to prolong their service. It would have 
been difficult, if not impossible, for an architect to have remodeled such houses 
successfully, and the results obtained by the owners and the country car- 
penters are crude indeed. Certainly the “hand-me-downs’ of another age 
cannot so well serve the present, and the families now trying to fit them- 
selves to such buildings find it more difficult than did previous generations. 
Way New Farmuouszs Far. 
The inheritance of out-of-date buildings accounts for much of the incon- 
venience in and dissatisfaction with present-day farmhouses, but not with 
the wholly new ones. Why have the farmhouses built in our own generation 
failed to share, as they should, in the general improvements of the farm and 
maintain the standard of former years? 
We may find one of the answers to this question in the commercial spirit 
of our age, which is so rife among farmers and so dominant in our agricultural 
education. The improvements in farm implements are the products of in- 
ventive genius stimulated by such spirit, and the better methods of farming 
are the results of scientific research and teaching, the ultimate aim of which
-P-A-G-E-25
  WoMEN’sS CONFERENCE 24 
is increased crop production and enhanced profits. If the influence of the 
house on the profit-and-loss account could have been better understood, 
the house would undoubtedly have shared more in the improvements of the 
farm, but it has not been considered a paying investment and housework 
has not been regarded as having a productive value. 
On the other hand, the field equipment has offered great inducements to 
the manufacturer for improvements and he has continued year after year 
with the greatest skill and intelligence his millions could command to increase 
the efficiency of his products and to decrease the cost of their manufacture. 
These improvements have eliminated much of the drudgery of field work, 
and have raised the servile toiler to the mastery of engines and implements 
which, at the pulling of levers, do the work formerly requiring many hands. 
The farmer who once sweltered under a harvest sun and gathered the grain 
in handfuls from the fingers of the cradle, may now ride on a spring seat 
and trip the bundle carrier with his foot; but his wife, in many instances, 
continues as in former years, to carry water from the distant well and slops 
from the kitchen door. 
The servant who had no other responsibility than that of household work, 
and no other cares than those of her personal needs and desires, might have 
done the work allotted to her without great fatigue, but it was sufficiently 
irksome to drive her from the farm. The wife and perhaps a daughter have 
now, in the majority of homes, the burden of all the work; and when the wife 
is mother, nurse and cook, and shares with her husband the cares of the 
farm, she is enslaved to farmhouse conditions which she cannot long endure. 
These conditions must be mitigated if the exodus from the farm is to be checked 
and the farm home is to attain the high standard which modern agriculture 
demands. 
If suitable houses could be manufactured and sold at a profit like agri- 
cultural implements, the farm home would soon become, with the help of its 
natural advantages, the best and the happiest in the world, instead of one to 
be dreaded. Then the farmer would have profusely colored catalogs of houses 
in abundance with floor plans, sections, elevations, and perspectives that 
would soon persuade him of his negligence to his family and himself, and 
induce him to exert every effort necessary to improve his farm and his home 
life with one of these houses. 
The salesman with large catalogs and miniature cardboard houses would 
entertain the family in a most interesting manner, and teach them things 
about rural architecture that they had never thought of before. He would 
point out serious defects in present home buildings and show how these mis- 
takes were all overcome in his houses. With indisputable evidence, obtained 
by careful and extended observations, he would convince the family that 
the women are wasting their energy in miles and miles of travel in and about 
the house, and by tons upon tons of lifting that would be saved in a properly 
planned and equipped house, to say nothing of the dangerous exposure to 
weather which is unavoidable in so many of our present buildings. He would 
show how the same care and study that made the improved kitchen cabinet 
a much-to-be-desired article, if not a necessity in our homes, had been applied
-P-A-G-E-26
  22 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
to the whole of the kitchen and of the house, and with a proportionate saving 
of space and labor throughout. 
He would interest the men in the details of construction, and explain these 
just as he does today in selling harvesters, wagons and automobiles. These 
explanations would educate the farmer in building work, and create an interest 
in it just as they have done in farm implements. Manufacturers would vie 
with each other.in evolving the most economical and perfect details of con- 
struction, and who can say that as a result of such competition we would not 
have houses of concrete, asbestos, gypsum, terra cotta, brick, etc., that would 
be more nearly fireproof, windproof and verminproof than those now in use 
and at a cost very little in excess of what we so often pay for inflammable 
houses of wood. ‘ 
But suitable houses adaptable to the varying needs of farmers living under 
different climatic, topographic, and industrial conditions, cannot be manu- 
factured and sold at a profit like farm machinery, and we cannot hope for 
such beneficent results from this source. This dream may, however, become 
a happy reality under the rightful management of the public institutions 
established to work out the farmers’ scientific and technical problems. What 
is impractical to the manufacturer as a problem of profit and loss may be 
practical to the United States Department of Agriculture and to the agricul- 
tural colleges, and social and economic conditions seem now to demand their 
attention to this work. 
Economic AspecT OF THE PROBLEM. 
Until recently, the problem of agricultural production seemed of para- 
mount importance and engrossed the attention of agricultural institutions, 
but no sooner did it become possible under scientific methods of farming to 
grow the proverbial two blades of grass than it became impractical to do 
so because of the economic conditions affecting the marketing of crops. 
The farmer has now the convincing proof that his income is cut in two by 
the present system of getting his products to the consumer, and that it is 
as essential to his success to avoid the exploitation of his earnings as it is of 
his soil. This is forcing him, out of necessity for self-protection, to interest 
himself in economic problems wholly foreign to those of agricultural produc- 
tion, and the farmer who lacks the ability and the inclination to cope with 
the industrial conditions now forcing themselves upon him, however success- 
ful he may be in other phases of farming, will surely fail to reap the full reward 
of his labor. 
These conditions are forcing the unskilled and inefficient either off the 
farm, or to a beggarly existence and bringing to the farm the intelligence and 
the business ability essential to the successful management of other in- 
dustries. Such farm management cannot and does not regard the farmhouse 
and woman’s work as unproductive of wealth and it demands for tenants, as 
well as for the owner, houses that minister adequately to their social and 
industrial needs. 
The management of other industrial concerns recognizes the economic 
value of labor-saving devices and of buildings that minister to the comfort
-P-A-G-E-27
       WoMEN’s CONFERENCE 23 
and enjoyment of employees both at the factories and at the homes, and in- 
creasing efforts are being made by managers to provide better houses for the 
workmen and to elevate their home life. One of the earliest and most gigantic 
efforts of this kind was undertaken by a firm of soap manufacturers at Port 
Sunlight, near Liverpool, England. The managers of this industry state 
that as a result of this enterprise— 
‘ce %* * the output and the quality per man have risen considerably 
during the last twenty years . . . If, little by little, similar schemes 
and minor improvements are everywhere introduced and react as favorably 
_ upon profits as they appear to have done at Port Sunlight, then there is 
hope for industrial England.” 
Many examples of the application of this principle of better houses for 
employees are now found in America and there is no longer any question as 
to its economic value. It is as applicable, if not more so, to farming than 
to any other industry, and the increasing need of better farmhouses makes 
their attainment one of the most important of farm-management problems. 
Buildings for the stock have had the careful attention of animal husbandry- 
men for a number of years, and complete plans and specifications, bills of 
materials, and cost data for dairy barns of varying sizes, are now furnished 
free to farmers by the Bureau of Animal Industry of the U. 8. Department 
of Agriculture. These buildings have been carefully worked out with regard 
to hygienic conditions and economy both of construction and of the work 
within the barns. : 
The dairy barn is a purely utilitarian structure, subject only to a few prin- 
ciples of planning and design and but little influenced by the varying external 
conditions of different localities. Its economic value is clearly in evidence, 
so it has shared generously in the improvement of the farm. Moreover, dairy- 
men have been constrained by municipal regulations to build modern, sanitary 
barns that will conserve the health of the cows and the healthfulness of the 
milk. 
The residence, on the other hand, is not, or at least it should not be a purely 
utilitarian structure. It is subject to more principles of planning and design 
than any other building erected by man, and to many of the external condi- 
tions that affect the health, comfort, and habits of the family. Its economic 
value is not clearly in evidence, but it is not difficult for the discerning mind 
to comprehend. It is the most important building on the farm, and money 
judiciously expended in its construction equipment will inevitably bring 
greater returns than in any other improvement which the farmer can make. 
Health in the house is certainly as great an asset to the farmer as health in 
the dairy barn, and happiness and contentment in the family as essential 
to efficient service as improved tools and outbuildings. 
The possible saving in the first cost of building is in itself an item of such 
magnitude as to claim the attention of economists. To the uninformed, it 
may seem irrational to say that a $3,000 house could be so planned and 
constructed as better to serve the farmer than the $4,000 house, which he 
recently built; but one acquainted with actual facts would consider such a 
statement as wholly conservative. The author of the “Farmstead’’ stated: 
“After having made a long and most careful study of them, I estimated    
-P-A-G-E-28
  24 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
that from thirty to forty per cent. of the cost of farm buildings is useless and 
sometimes worse than thrown away.” 
If more conservative than the author, we estimate the amount at ten per 
cent., then there was wasted or worse than thrown away in farm buildings 
during the last decade, according to the thirteenth census, more than $250,- 
000,000, or more than $25,000,009 annually, because of the improper planning 
and construction of buildings. 
Uneconomic Farmuouses Dur to Lack or Expert ASSISTANCE. 
Architects probably plan less than one per cent. of farmhouses, yet of all 
the problems of the farm, there is perhaps none for which the farmer is more 
in need of expert assistance. One of the profession writes in a current peri- 
odical: 
“Tt is unfortunate for the farmer and the appearance of the country-side 
that trained architects may not assist him in his building enterprises. The 
State experiment stations could do the farmers no greater service than by 
establishing a bureau of buildings. A trained architect might be engaged 
to whom the farmers, for a nominal cost, might have recourse, and who would 
send an assistant to any locality to advise and then make drawings which 
would assure the farmer a suitable plan for his farm buildings, fittingly ex- 
pressed on the exterior.” 
The family’s help is essential to the proper planning of the residence, but 
its inexperienced members are not capable of planning a house which is in 
the highest degree serviceable, comfortable, economical and beautiful. 
There is perhaps no better proof of this statement than the results of the 
competition for farmhouse plans conducted in 1910 by a western farm paper 
at the suggestion of the chief of the office of farm management. This com- 
petition, the first of its kind, must have brought out the best efforts of the 
farmers and their wives. The man who suggested the competition was pre- 
vailed upon to act as judg¢ in awarding the prizes, and the following remarks 
from his report partly explain the results— 
“About 660 plans of farmhouses were submitted. No one of them was fully 
satisfactory. The contest revealed the fact that architectural problems are 
generally not understood. Many of the best plans submitted were strictly 
city houses and not adapted to farm purposes. 
“Architecture in this country has developed almost exclusively out of con- 
siderations that apply to city conditions. Country conditions are not met 
in the ordinary architectural literature of the day. 
“The planning of farmhouses has not been reduced to a scientific basis. 
By far the larger number of plans submitted insist upon some particular pet 
notion of the contestant and a single feature, sometimes important and some- 
times not, is inserted into the plans frequently to the neglect of other import- 
ant features.” 
To verify this statement of the judge, observe the opening sentence in the 
description accompanying one of the plans: 
“The front door has a glass panel and on either side of it and the fireplace 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
cae CONFERENCE 25 
are long, narrow windows five feet from the floor, with small diamond-shaped 
panes. The same kind of glass should be used in the bath room, ete.” 
At the latter part of her description, the kitchen comes in for one sentence. 
Another competitor begins thus: 
“Having lived a number of years on a farm and knowing the many extra 
steps the wife and mother takes in her daily work, I have often thought if 
I were to plan a house and home I should have it built like the following plan.” 
The plan she submitted has twenty outside corners. The sitting room is 
enclosed on four sides except for two windows and a door in one corner. The 
bathroom can be reached from one bedroom only by passing through an ad- 
joining bedroom, the parlor, dining-room and the kitchen, or by going out 
into the back yard and through the kitchen. It can be reached from the three 
bedrooms upstairs only by coming down into the sitting room and through 
the dining room and kitchen. The stair hall on the second floor is fifteen 
feet square, the same size as each of the three bedrooms on that floor. 
It is not the tillers of the soil who effect the improvements in farm machinery 
although working daily with it, nor is it the housewives who can best plan 
their workshops and family rooms, although they spend a lifetime in them. 
It is the men and women who familiarize themselves with the work to be 
done and then apply themselves to the single task of devising means and 
methods of doing it most expeditiously, economically, and easily. These 
must be depended upon to handle the farmhouse problems, but as previously 
stated, their work must have the support of public agencies to attain its 
best results. When, with the help of such agencies and the co-operation of 
farmers, these specialists have learned the exact requirements of farmhouses, 
and have worked out model plans in accordance with the many conditions 
to be provided for, when they shall have clearly drawn and pictured these 
houses, intelligently explained them and accurately figured their costs, then 
no longer will there remain an excuse for the uneconomic and unsightly houses 
now so common in our rural communities. 
It may not be practicable or even desirable for the Department of Agricul- 
ture to furnish plans and specifications worked out for the particular needs 
of individual farmers; but it will be practicable and quite desirable for it to 
furnish plans and specifications worked out for the general needs of farmers 
and to so delineate, illustrate, and explain the plans that the layman may 
readily understand the principles involved and apply them to the remodeling 
of his present house, or to the building of a new one. 
The multiplicity of conditions to be contended with in planning, designing 
and constructing domestic buildings, and the infinite combinations of these 
conditions render impracticable the making of model plans and specifications 
for individual use without need of some alterations, except for the most in- 
expensive houses. When, however, the general conditions obtaining in a 
locality are carefully considered and a number of plans and designs are worked 
out in accordance with these conditions and the cost of each carefully es- 
timated, then each family may better understand in advance what it should 
have and what it may hope to get. It may find among the plans some that 
so nearly meet its requirements as to need but little change. 
The most inexpensive houses must of necessity be simple and planned along  
-P-A-G-E-30
  26 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
general lines. Renters are shifting and the tenant houses should be planned 
and built for the average tenant family. It is, therefore, quite possible to 
make plans and specifications, bills of material, and detailed costs of such 
buildings that may be used without change over large sections of the country. 
When we consider that but little more than one-half of the farms are oper- 
ated by owners and that during the last decade the number of rented farms in- 
creased by more than 324,000, we may better understand the importance of the 
tenant-house problem. When we consider, too, that the average annual 
net income of farmers, after deducting five per cent on their investment, is 
less than $400, we may better understand the importance of the inexpensive 
farmhouse for the owner. 
Such houses cannot be adequate to the families’ needs; but they may, if 
intelligently planned, serve the families much better than many of the cheap 
houses they have. If well designed, they may, with the help of vines, shrubs, 
and trees, become the prettiest spots in the landscape, and more beautiful 
than the expensive but crowded city houses. 
Tue Socian ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM. 
The possible saving to be effected in the first cost of farm buildings seems 
in itself to warrant the careful attention of agricultural economists; but greater 
than this is the possible economy in household labor, the conservation of 
women’s strength and the promotion of health and happiness in the family. 
Economic considerations sufficiently justify the work and form the most 
tangible basis on which to handle it; but they are of minor importance in 
comparison with the social, ethical and civil aspects of the problem. So 
great is the influence of the house upon the home life of the family, and upon 
the character of its members, that it is one of the most potent factors in our 
social structure for good or ill. Pleasant, comfortable and happy farm homes 
tend to hold families together; but cheerless, unlovable, and insanitary houses 
drive boys and girls to the cities, if not to dens of vice. Investigations of 
prisons, insane asylums and houses of ill fame have seemed to prove the fact 
that sins which account for the existence of these institutions are, most often, 
bred and nurtured in the inadequate and unhappy homes of the poor, many 
of which are on the farm. 
“Dwight L. Moody said of England that it was more in need of homes 
than of churches.” 2 
“The ancient Jews made ample provisions for the home, realizing that what 
the home is the child will be. The family, home and household all figure 
prominently in the ministry of Christ; indeed, the primitive Christianity 
began in the home, and through the home and family was it propagated.” 
“Tn the attractiveness of the home lies the true solution of many evils, 
and to strike at the root of social sins, it is necessary to improve the housing 
of the great mass of humanity in both city and country.”
-P-A-G-E-31
  
WomENn’s CONFERENCE 27 
Tue Civic ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM. 
“The home is the cradle in which is moulded the character of the nation,” 
and every influence upon the home counts for weal or woe in our national 
life. Foster love for the home and there will result an unshakable love for 
the country; stifle it and anarchy will walk abroad. Study the problems of 
the home as carefully as the science of war and expend on it funds as great 
as those spent on our armed defense, and we will have a citizenship so strong 
in body and mind, so prosperous and so loyal as to be invincible to any foe 
that might assail us. The housing of the so-called common people is of 
vital importance to the nation’s welfare. It has become a problem for states- 
men and for the promotion and support of governments. With better houses 
we will have better homes; with better homes, better citizens; and with better 
citizens, a stronger and a better nation. : 
A Practicat SOLUTION OF THE FARMHOUSE PROBLEM. 
The subject matter of this theme is not new. It is patent to the most 
casual observer, who gives any thought to present economic and social con- 
ditions in rural communities. It has become a subject of frequent discussions 
by the more fortunate women of the farm who have time enough to think and 
talk about such things and especially by those interested in the enfranchise- 
ment of the women from the unnecessary conditions that rob labor of its 
pleasures, its healthfulness, and its efficiency, and makes the farm home 
one to be avoided instead of what it might and of right ought to be—the best 
and the most desirable of all. It is a subject of increasing importance to the 
agricultural press and to the thousands of readers of farm papers. ‘House 
Building Numbers” are now a special feature of many of these papers and, 
may we not say, the most popular numbers? 
These discussions and newspaper articles are arousing a general interest 
in better farmhouses and they are quite essential to the practical solution of 
this problem; but they are not in themselves sufficient. They lack the scien- 
tific information, the actual facts as to the economic and aesthetic possibil- 
ities. These can only be attained by the systematic methods of investigation, 
invention, and application, which have accounted for the improvements in 
other equipment of the farm. This is the work which the U. 8. Department 
of Agriculture has undertaken. 
Tue First Pran PuBLIsHED BY THE DEPARTMENT. 
The plan of this first farmhouse, which is reproduced here, shows a build- 
ing that is suitable either for tenant or for the owner himself, if he has only 
a small family. 
, It shows a simple, four-cornered structure, with no projection save the eaves 
which overhang and protect the walls and window openings. The house is 
planned for the smallest dimensions and the most inexpensive arrangement 
consistent with the necessities and convenience of a small family. It has 
but one chimney and one outside entrance.

At first glance this single door may seem inadequate; but a little study of 
the plan will reveal that another could not have been provided without 
sacrifice of interior space and convenience or increase in the size and cost of 
the building. With this entrance, however, nearest the barns and the high- 
way approach, and treated with a simple, inexpensive pergola and benches 
which separate the lawn and the back yard, it should serve every purpose in 
so small a house of a front door as well as kitchen door. In many ten and 
twelve-room farmhouses with three or four outside doors, only one of them 
is much used, and that is, either in or near the kitchen. 
Notwithstanding the simplicity and the “playhouse” appearance of this 
little building, it provides more usable space for the daily activities of the 
family than many larger houses. It is more compact, comfortable, health- 
ful and homelike than many farmhouses costing twice as much. 
Very few residences of any size or cost, for instance, have a kitchen more 
pleasantly located, better lighted and ventilated, and more conveniently 
arranged than this little four-room house. It is brightened by the morning 
sun, cooled by the southern breezes, and shielded from the intense heat of 
summer afternoons. It commands a view of the garden, the play grounds, 
the barns, lawn, gate and highway, and opens on a screened porch which, 
in summer, is the most livable nook in the house. Much of the kitchen work 
may be done there away from the heat and fumes of the stove, which, happily 
for the other rooms of the house, blow out through the north and east windows. 
The stove is in a light place, and with the porch window closed, it is out of 
the cross-draughts of air. Moreover, it is within six feet of the most distant 
fixture in the kitchen and but little farther from the dining table. All stove 
utensils are within reach, and the work table and fuel in the box beneath it 
are but two steps away. Theashes drop from the fire-box of the stove through 
a short pipe to the ash bin under the concrete floor. 
The walls of this under-floor bin are shown on the plan by dotted lines. 
The bin is under the stove and fireplace, and extends to the outer foundation 
wall of the kitchen, where the ashes and floor sweepings are removed by means 
of a long-handled drag. If the building is raised on a front terrace, as shown 
in the perspective, the bin will be twenty-six inches deep with its floor at 
ground level. With a cellar under the kitchen, the bin need be extended only 
to the front end of the stove. It will be deep enough to hold a year’s supply 
of ashes. 
The fuel box, supporting the table top, occupies space which might other- 
wise be wasted. It is filled from the outside of the house and emptied from the 
inside through a small door over the concrete floor. 
A trap or dump, like that in the fireplace, is provided for floor sweepings 
and possible dust from the door of the coal or wood box. It is in the concrete 
floor, behind the kitchen door, near the fuel-box opening and over the ash 
bin. 
The carrying of fuel and ashes is thus eliminated from the woman’s work, 
provided the man or boy fills the coal or wood box each week, or as often as 
may be necessary, and empties the ash bin two three times a year. 
‘The water problem also has been given careful attention in this little plan. 
Cistern water may be drawn from the bucket pump on the porch, or, if de-   
-P-A-G-E-34
  
30 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
sired, from a pitcher pump provided at the sink. Water is heated and stored 
in the reservoir of the stove. The sink with only the drainpipe to be provided 
is too inexpensive and necessary to omit from any kitchen and space enough 
has been saved in this plan to more than offset the cost of this convenience. 
It will be noticed that this kitchen excels many others in not being a thor- 
oughfare to other rooms. The men and boys will wash on the porch, leave 
their hats and raincoats there, and enter the living room without disturbing 
the kitchen workers. 
The living room is large enough for the longest. dining table that harvest 
days will ever require, and with its two routes to the kitchen, allows the house- 
wife to feed in comfort a number of workmen. With triple windows on the 
south and two on the north, a screened porch on the east and two bedrooms on 
the west, one of them in the form of an alcove, the place makes a very pleasant 
dining and sitting room, and with a glowing fire on the hearth, it will be 
comfortable and cheerful all the winter. 
The screened porch is as large as the plan will permit, and will be in demand 
for many purposes. Besides the usual kitchen work, the ironing and perhaps 
the clothes washing will be done there. A screen door locks up the house, and 
butter, meat and milk put on the porch at night to cool will thus be secure 
against dogs and cats. The porch will also be a useful place for dining, sleep- 
ing, playing and general living purposes, and its usefulness may be retained 
in winter by putting up a porch sash and a solid door. 
This is not a “model” farmhouse. It is inadequate even for the small- 
est families; but it is indicative of what may be done within the limita- 
tions of cost with which the Department must necessarily deal. It is the 
smallest of a series of plans being prepared by the Department, which in- 
crease little by little to seven or eight rooms, having all modern conveniences. 
It is not, however, the smallest of other series to be handled, for there is a 
demand from the south for more inexpensive tenant houses than this one, 
and for structures more suited to local conditions. 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING WATERWORKS FOR THE 
COUNTRY HOME. 
President Joe Cook, State Normal College, Hattiesburg, Miss. 
We will suppose first, that the source of water supply is a well and that the 
water is forty feet below the surface of the ground; second, that the well is 
fifty feet from the kitchen; third, that the distance from the well to the edge 
of the barn lot is 110 feet; fourth, that for the present water is to be put in 
the kitchen and in the barn lot; and, fifth, that, since the direction from the 
well to the barn lot is at right angles with the direction from the well to the 
kitchen, the water lines must be independent. 
In giving instructions for installing waterworks, I shall begin with the well. 
Put a substantial covering over the well. Concrete is preferable. Then 
install the pump. The pump will consist of a pump: stand, a brass-lined
-P-A-G-E-35
  WoMEN’s CONFERENCE 31 
cylinder, galvanized pipe connecting cylinder and pump stand, and pump 
rod. Should you be bothered with sand, it will be necessary to use a gauze 
brass jacket. I cannot give the exact number of feet of pipe and pump rod 
it will take, because I do not know how far below the water level it will be 
necessary to place the cylinder. The cylinder must be placed a sufficient 
depth below the water line to prevent the water from failing as it is pumped. 
The pump complete should cost not over $22.00. Some pump stands have 
the opening directly opposite the spout, while others have the opening on the 
side at right angles with the spout. For the pump with the opening directly 
opposite the spout, one will need the following items to connect the pump 
opening with the water main running to the tank, the water main being one 
foot under the ground: 
14-inch x 6-inch galvanized nipple. 
14-inch galvanized elbow. 
14-inch x 6-inch galvanized nipple. 
14-inch swinging brass check valve. 
14-inch x 6-inch galvanized nipple. 
14-inch angle brass valve. 
14-inch x 12-inch galvanized nipple. 
14-inch union galvanized coupling. 
14-inch x 3-feet galvanized pipe. 
114-inch galvanized elbow. 
14-inch x 12-inch galvanized nipple. 
14-inch galvanized tee, one run plugged. 
These connections, leading from the pump to one foot below the ground, 
should not cost above $4.40. 
Beginning at this connection from the pump and running to the center 
of the bottom of the tank—the tank tower being twelve feet high and the 
point directly under the center of the tank being eleven feet from the con- 
nection leading from the pump to the ground—the following items will be 
needed: 
10 feet of 114-inch galvanized pipe. 
14-inch galvanized tee, outlet reduced to 34-inch for 34-inch galvanized 
pipe from this tee to kitchen. 
14-inch x 12-inch galvanized nipple. 
14-inch galvanized tee, one run reduced to 34 inch for 34-inch galvanized 
pipe from this tee to barn lot. 
(The items above to be one foot below ground.) 
10 feet of 114-inch galvanized pipe. 
14-inch galvanized union coupling. 
14-inch x 12-inch galvanized nipple. 
14-inch globe brass valve. 
14-inch x 12-inch galvanized nipple connecting with center of bottom of 
tank. 
The above items should cost not more than $4.65. 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  32 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
Beginning at the tee specified above as the tee from which the pipe shall 
lead to the kitchen, put in the following: 
50 feet of 34-inch galvanized pipe one foot under the ground. 
34-inch galvanized elbow. ; 
34-inch to 14-inch bushing. 
6 feet of 14-inch galvanized pipe, reaching 3 feet above the floor in the 
kitchen. 
Y-inch galvanized elbow. 
44-inch plain brass bib faucet. 
1 porcelain lined kitchen sink, 18 x 30. 
These items should cost not above $10.00. 
Beginning at the tee leading to the lot, put in the following: 
110 feet of 34-inch galvanized pipe. 
34-inch galvanized elbow. 
3 feet of 34-inch galvanized pipe. 
34-inch galvanized elbow. 
34-inch plain brass bib faucet. 
These items should cost not more than $6.50. 
I have not made the above lists of materials out in lump, but in such way 
that, if they are installed in the order in which they are given, they will go 
tight on from the pump opening to the proper places. The cutting and thread- 
ing at machine shops of all pipe, the lengths described herein, have been 
taken into account in the prices quoted. 
For the tank tower, there will be needed: 
4 pieces 4x 4x 12 
4 pieces 2x6x 8 
8 pieces 2x 4x12 
6 pieces 2x6x 5 
18 pieces 2x4x 6 
Total 262 feet. 
This lumber can be purchased at $18.00 per 1,000 and in addition one will 
need two pounds of twenty-penny nails and two pounds of ten-penny nails. 
The material for the tank tower should not cost more than $4.85. For a 
farm, commonly known as a “two-horse farm,” a small tank will answer the 
purpose. You can get a 660-gallon corrugated, galvanized iron tank with 
cover and with an inch and a quarter opening in the center of the bottom 
for $16.50, making the tank and tower cost $21.35. I think this size tank 
- ample, although, when the farmer has put in waterworks, he will find that he 
will use many times as much water as he formerly used. 
A gasoline engine of size ample to pump the water will cost $42.00. I 
recommend the upright engine with pump jack attached. Such an engine has 
an extra pulley with which can be run a washing machine or other labor- 
saving machines when the farmer feels able to put them in.
-P-A-G-E-37
WoMEN’s. CONFERENCE 33 
The suggestion as to the advisability of getting a much larger gasoline en- 
gine than needed for pumping, and moving it about to do other work is, I 
think, not a good one. I strongly advise an engine of about one or one and 
one-half horsepower, attach it to the pump, and keep it there to do that work, 
not moving it at all. With the outfit I have described above, the tank can 
be pumped full of water at a cost of three cents for gasoline and oil. The tank 
of water will supply all the water necessary for the household and the farm 
stock for one day. 
To sum up, the total cost of the materials for this outfit is as follows: 
. .$ 22.00 
4.40 Pump complete. .

These prices are retail prices, f. o. b. Hattiesburg, Miss. Should neighbors 
co-operate and purchase several of these outfits at a time, there will be a 
material reduction to each. When you shall have installed your waterworks, 
you will find the system the greatest labor saver and the greatest source of 
pleasure you have ever had on your farm; and, above all, your wife will so 
appreciate it that, should it be moved, she will‘move too. 
  
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 
Erriciency In HouseHotp MaNnaGEMENT, 
Miss Mary E. Frayser, Winthrop College, S. C. 
“Mastery of the work of the home is the first step to self mastery.’’ The 
work of the home should be conducted on business principles. To do this 
will not eliminate the spiritual element; but, successfully done, will allow 
for finer spiritual growth. The first need of the home is careful planning. A 
planning which shall recognize the purpose for which the home was created, 
needs of each member of the family, and the needs of the family as a unit. 
The relation of one room to another should be carefully thought out if a new 
home is being built, and how an old one may be altered, sometimes at small 
cost, should also receive consideration. Because the interior arrangement of 
a home is not convenient is no reason why it should remain so. We women 
are too much given to accepting inconvenience, and the drudgery it fre- 
quently entails, as our portion. Because the kitchens of our grandmothers 
were large is no reason why ours should be. Many of the processes carried 
on within the kitchen in her day are now done within the walls of factories.
-P-A-G-E-38
34 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
A small kitchen saves a woman innumerable steps. A sink the right height 
for the woman who is to wash dishes at it saves her back. A stool on which 
she may sit when she washes dishes or prepares the food saves body and nerves. 
A zinc-covered table just the right height for her with shelves above on which 
are placed the implements and food materials which she needs in the prepa- 
ration of nearly every meal are her due. She should see to it that she has 
these things. A little careful thinking as to which utensils should be grouped 
near the sink, which above her work-table, which near the stove for the work 
normally done at each, will lead to a good arrangement. No shelf on which 
things frequently used are kept should be so high that the woman cannot 
reach it without tip-toeing. The things in daily use should not be put on a 
shelf so low that a woman has to stoop to get them. Food materials which 
do not spoil when kept in the kitchen should be kept there. Thus many 
miles of travel between pantry and work table may be saved. The closet 
opening into the kitchen should be without doors, and the shelves spaced 
according to the utensils to be kept on them. Upper shelves should never 
contain but one row of jars or vessels, so that a woman may see at a glance 
what is there, and not run the risk of knocking down one thing in reaching 
something back of it, for this means vexation of spirit. Stove, sink, work- 
table and shelves should have a definite relation to each other, which shall 
mean convenience and a minimum of labor in doing the work of the kitchen. 
The route from the stove to the dining table should be as short as possible 
and unobstructed. China used daily should be kept in a china closet without 
doors. It is used too frequently to get dusty and the doors are a nuisance. 
Let us do away with waste motions. Egg beaters, spoons, saucepans, cups, 
and pans may be hung near kitchen stove and work-table. A world of worry 
is saved by having them in open sight. A table on rollers with an undershelf 
helps tremendously as a carrier of dishes to and from the kitchen. 
We should take a lesson from the men who sit in revolving chairs before 
desks with exactly the implements needed, and having the spaces designed 
for the uses to which they are to be put. With desk phone at hand and trash 
basket to one side without rising or undue reaching, they can transact a 
world of business. If our work were theirs they would soon think out some 
equally convenient equipment and arrangement of it. As our work is ours, 
we must do it for ourselves. 
If the kitchen is very large and the family eats in it, divide it into a small 
kitchen and a dining room. A separate dining room is much easier to keep 
clean than a kitchen used as kitchen and dining room both. Orderliness and 
the social side of life are promoted by separating the dining room from the 
kitchen. Halls are often waste spaces. The partition between them and some 
room where additional space is needed may be profitably taken out. When 
the hall is part of a room it will not be used as a depository for overshoes, 
umbrellas, wraps, etc. 
If a separate living room is not available, see to it that one end of the 
dining room is arranged as a sitting room. It may well contain book-shelves, 
some musical instrument, a sewing machine, comfortable chairs, a table with 
lamp on it, books and magazines, and a window seat box having lid with 
hinges, which shall contain school books and magazines and serve as a seat 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  Women’s CONFERENCE 35 
as well. It is easy to arrange a room so that the end next to the kitchen shall 
have distinctively the character of a dining room, and the other end that of 
a sitting room. 
The woman in the home should plan the work for each day and for each 
week. The unexpected may cause slight changes in the plans, but such plans 
will go far toward efficient home management. 
Over night preparation for the work of the next day should be made. The 
cereal should boil.a few minutes on the supper fire, and be put in the fireless 
cooker for breakfast. The breakfast table should be set after supper. It is 
well to have enough dishes not to be obliged to wash the supper dishes in the 
evening. The soiled dishes should be cleared up and put under water. Beiore 
retiring the sitting room should be straightened. In all this work the children 
should have a part. Each child should put his own school books, hat and 
overcoat in a specified place every night instead of appealing frantically to 
mother to know where they are at the last minute before starting to school. 
Such preparations save the mother and keep the atmosphere pleasant instead 
of stressful. Someone has said that “if a woman keeps good tempered until 
8 o’clock in the morning, the chances are she will keep so all day.” 
A good steel range is needed in every farm kitchen. It should have a hot- 
water reservoir at the fire end. In addition, every kitchen should be equipped 
with an oil or alcohol stove, if gas is not obtainable. This makes quick heat 
available in the farm as well as in the city kitchen. In hot weather such a 
stove with oven and a fireless cooker make possible the preparation of a large 
dinner without heating up the kitchen and with an economic expenditure 
of strength. 
Every kitchen should be equipped with running water. If it is a city kitchen 
this goes without saying. If it is a rural kitchen it may be had at small cost 
in a primitive way or at greater cost with greater efficiency. Sometimes 
water may be piped from a nearby spring on a hillside into the kitchen so 
easily that one can but wonder that it has not been done. If that isn’t pos- 
sible, at least the outside wall of any kitchen may be equipped with a strong 
shelf and a twenty-five-gallon keg, with pipe and faucet through the wall 
of the kitchen to a basin or dishpan on a shelf inside. This keg may be filled 
by hand from the well. 
Some provision for carrying off the waste water from the kitchen ought to 
be made. The most primitive is to have a long wooden trough painted, be- 
cause wood absorbs everything unless so treated, and have the end of the 
trough moved occasionally so that the water may not saturate the ground in 
any one place. Even so the ground should be spaded up so that the sun and 
air may purify it after each shifting of the trough. The wood for the trough 
should be filled with a preservative or good paint on all sides before being put 
together, then painted again after finishing. The trough should not have a 
cover, since the sun and air are needed to purify it also. 
In every case the goal on which the housewife’s eyes are set should be 
water piped into the house, sewerage, a sink and stationary washtubs, and a 
bathroom, for they constitute means for promoting the health, efficiency and 
happiness of the whole family, and that is the larger purpose which these 
suggestions have in view.

    WoMEN’s CONFERENCE 37 
EXPLANATION OF THE Dairy Procram SuGccEestep ror Country WoMEN. 
It is amazing how many duties enter into the day of a rural woman who, 
as wife and mother, is the head of a rural home, and it is with diffidence 
that I submit a program suggesting how these duties shall be made to fit 
into a day without asking that a miracle be performed which history chronicles 
only once, namely, that the sun be turned back as it was for Joshua! 
However, the need for planning so that the work may be done systematically 
and every interest of the home receive a fair share of the attention of the 
housewife is clearly recognized. Thus, and thus only, will conflicting claims 
be adjusted and the body and spirit of a woman be least severely taxed. 
The program speaks for itself. A word is needed concerning only a few 
changes which the conservative may deem unwarranted liberties. Tuesday 
is suggested as wash day instead of the time-honored Monday, because the 
house needs more care on Monday as it has received less on Sunday than 
usual, and been more used. The wear on the clothes is less great if they are 
mended before they go into the wash tubs. <A few stitches will often serve 
before the wash where many are needed after. The washing itself is made 
easier by having the clothes soak over night. Thus dirt is loosened. A mini- 
mum time is allowed for the washing in the belief that any woman can have 
a washing machine and wringer, if she will. There are about 300 reputable 
ones run by either hand power or machinery on the market. The price of 
many are within the reach of most. The time allowed for ironing is short, 
because to do the flat work by hand is a crime. It should be done with a 
mangle. The housewife should use as much material which requires no iron- 
ing as possible. Seersucker, crepon, ratine, outing flannel, Turkish towels, 
etc., are suggested. 
Fifteen minutes is apportioned for rest each day, except Sunday, in the 
morning, because the housewife needs it after the rush of the morning hours. 
The rest period before dinner may well be taken in the rocker. That in 
the afternoon should mean relaxation on couch or bed. 
The churning in cool weather should not be done every day. A little in- 
genuity will devise means for keeping the milk. To churn every day is to 
give that phase of the home work more than its fair share of the time. 
Visiting is apportioned a definite time on the program lest its claims be 
lost sight of. Community meetings for grown people are apportioned a place 
in the belief that good to the community will result. Community meetings 
for the young people are advocated because of a conviction that their needs 
along this line are not usually met in rural communities. They need enter- 
tainment and amusement. They need to be brought together for pleasure 
planned and guided by the older people in the community. Time is allotted 
for a club meeting, because in many rural communities in South Carolina 
woman’s clubs have brought pleasure and profit not only to the women mem- 
bers, but also to whole communities. 
Some related industry of the home is meant to suggest that the women 
may well undertake some work naturally related to farm life which shall 
yield her a return in money. Gardening, canning, pickling, preserving, poultry 
raising, dairying and weaving are suggested.

  38 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
For discussion of the past week’s conduct with each child separately, an 
especial time is fixed in the belief that such a heart to heart talk between 
mother and child is needed for the moral development of the child. The child 
learns to look forward to this checking up, appraisement and tender counsel. 
It will help to shape his course, for it will be a real factor in his development. 
This program is submitted, knowing well that no home-keeper abides ab- 
solutely by one, but believing that like a mariner, she needs a compass by 
which to steer her course.

These menus are planned for different seasons, Sunday, Monday and Tues- 
day being for spring and summer, Wednesday and Thursday for autumn, 
and Friday and Saturday for winter. The foods chosen are those which should 
be obtainable anywhere in the country, 
In this day of complaint about the cost of living, usually referring to food 
—it is interesting to know the prices of meals. Of course, when the materials 
for these are produced on one’s own farm, the cost would be less than if 
bought at the market. But even if they would not have been sold they rep- 
resent a certain sum of money and should be given their value. The prices 
of many things vary in different parts of the country, but these used here 
would seem to be a fair average. For Sunday’s meals the cost is 41.17 cents, 
Monday 38 cents, Tuesday 30.96 cents, Wednesday, 38.29 cents, Thursday 
32.89 cents, Friday 29.80 cents, Saturday 28.88 cents. 
HOW CAN WE INDUCE THE COUNTRY HOUSEWIFE TO PLANT 
A MORE VARIED VEGETABLE GARDEN? 
Mrs. Jane S. McKimmon, in charge Girls’ Demonstration Work, Raleigh, N. C. 
       
                      I sometimes think as I look out on the usual country vegetable garden 
situated this year in one part of the corn field, another in an entirely different 
spot, placed just where it is easiest to plow or cultivate along with the farm 
crops, what possible inducement can there be for the woman on the farm to 
take a hand in trying to make something better of it? 
Eyen if her imagination has been fired by the beautiful spring seed catalogs 
—and it usually is—and she is filled with enthusiasm to try planting some of 
the delicious vegetables pictured, things seem rather hopeless when she looks
-P-A-G-E-44
  40 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
away off in the field at the three or four rows of cabbages, onions, and turnips 
constituting the family garden; and it takes a pretty good stock of determina- 
tion to induce her to walk the distance often enough to do the planting and 
cultivating necessary for a trial of new vegetables. 
A garden isnot your garden unless you do some of the work in it, and you 
do not grow to love it unless you have at least some of the care of it. We 
who have our gardens firmly anchored around the kitchen door, who can walk 
out and sniff our fragrant herbs, gather our lettuce, spinach, garden peas, 
of berries from our nearby beds, or look from the windows on our brightly 
blooming flower borders, can scarcely realize what a part this nearness plays 
in the love and interest we give our growing things. 
The majority of women have a natural love for plants, and there are odds 
and ends of time they would be glad to devote to the garden if they could 
only be given a fair start, a well plowed and well laid-out spot at the back 
door that they could have and hold as their garden for all time. Let us rotate 
the garden crops, but for goodness’ sake do not rotate the garden spots! 
Create a love for the locality by encouraging beautifying with flower 
borders; it attaches one so firmly. Permanent locality means strawberry 
beds, raspberries and blackberries around the fences, asparagus beds in the 
corner and many old-fashioned herbs for seasoning. It means old friends 
peeping from the soil with every April sun and gives us such a feeling of 
proud possession that I do not think it is to be lightly considered as one of 
the means of inducing the country woman to plant a more creditable vegetable 
garden. 
Another inducement which I have found most encouraging is showing the 
woman a profit in the undertaking; not only in the added health of the 
family, but in the dollars and cents it brings to her pocket-book. If she 
knows the housewife or merchant in the neighboring village will take her early 
vegetables at a fair price, or that she can ship to some city market, she is 
usually keen to plant the kind of vegetables that find the best market— 
and it goes without saying that what she grows she eats. There is always 
enough surplus for the family table. 
Two of my little canning club girls grew big Boston lettuce last winter for 
market, but told me no one could make them eat that grass. “How, then, 
can you recommend it to your customers,” said I, “if you do not know how it 
tastes?” The question set them thinking; and as we were at the time of the 
conversation on the train making a prize trip to Washington, I took them in 
to the diner for lunch and ordered lettuce with a very delicious dressing. 
Both little girls ate quite a generous helping with relish, and wrote me after 
they went home, ‘‘We are eating our own lettuce every day, and it is good.” 
Spinach, salsify, celery, parsnips, carrots, turnip salad, and lettuce all sell 
well in the towns and are winter vegetables that grow very well in most parts 
of the south with no protection. A winter garden is next to no trouble to care 
for, and the fine addition to the meat, bread and cabbage diet would do 
wonders for the family health. 
By the way, I have just heard a eulogy of the ubiquitous calibaue and onion, 
and what was said of them was true to the letter. They are rich in mineral 
salts and they furnish us with fibre and bulk and have been a bulwark of 
   
-P-A-G-E-45
  WoMEN’s CONFERENCE 41 
strength in protecting us from a literal bread and meat diet; but I am going 
to shut my ears to their good qualities as I am tired of seeing them every day 
when we could have so many toothsome vegetables to put in their places. 
In my own garden I have had six vegetables in abundance this winter and 
have grown them all in the open with the exception of lettuce. This I planted 
in a cold frame and covered with a cloth at night and have had beautiful 
hard heads for my table. 
I speak of the ease with which winter gardens can be produced because 
so few people seem to have them, but spring and summer gardens ought 
certainly to be planted by every woman who hasa twenty foot square of soil. 
It takes work, yes, and plenty of it, for the hoe must keep ahead of the grass 
and just behind the showers; but the rewards of your labor are so bounteous 
that you are amply paid for anything you have done and feel morally and 
mentally a better woman for the experience. 
In support of my statement that profit is an inducement for planting, 
I should like to cite again the canning club girls as examples. Starting 
primarily with a tenth acre in tomatoes, they have gone on to beans, sweet, 
corn, okra, snaps, berries, etc., because there was an insistent demand for 
all of these, both canned and fresh. They have taken advantage of the mar- 
ket for the profit there was in it and incidentally the family table is supplied 
more abundantly and with more varied vegetables than many of them have 
ever known before. In many instances the girls’ example has induced her 
neighbors to grow better things and her scientific methods of spraying and 
cultivating have made her garden patch a supply for neighbors whom the 
unfavorable season had caught unprepared for drought and plant disease. 
By growing and marketing these girls have been given new ideals of food 
and have had their manner of cooking revolutionized. 
There are ways in which a country housewife can secure a market for her 
produce and that without being compelled, as a little girl puts it, to “peddle 
it around.’”’? There are many, many hungry town dwellers who are longing 
for nice fresh vegetables and would buy if they only knew where to secure them. 
It only remains for producer and consumer to get together. Where the farm 
is on a good road, here is a plan of advertising that has worked out nicely. 
Tack a neat board to the gate-post with the products for sale, vegetables, 
canned goods, poultry, etc., and have the price of each printed plainly upon 
it. The hungry citizens driving out in their automobiles read as they run, 
and usually stop running to look more closely into matters; and it is seldom 
that they do not go home with the machine the heavier for their purchases. 
Get in touch with the Housewives’ League of the nearest towns. These 
women are organized consumers on the lookout for fresh, clean, wholesome 
food, and are seeking to co-operate with the country housewife in getting 
her produce to their doors. In North Carolina we have a get-together con- 
vention of town and country housewives which meets the latter part of every 
August in Raleigh. We discuss all kinds of things that would bring us closer 
together, and marketing vegetables, chickens, eggs, meat, and anything else 
produced on the farm is one of our chief subjects. 
The local papers and bulletin boards in the city markets stating what you 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  42 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
have for sale and the price, and when it will be delivered at the door, has 
proven a very effective way of getting at the consumer. 
If we can teach our women that there is a market for almost any good article 
of food, and emphasize the fact that when a high standard of perfection is 
established and kept up, there is no trouble about getting the purchasers, 
we can arouse in them a determination to grow, select, grade and pack their 
products in the most approved manner. We will, I believe also, notice an 
improvement in the family ideals in many ways. Certainly will we notice 
an increase in the variety on the table. 
HOW TO MAKE READY MONEY. 
By Miss Mary E. Creswell, Assistant in Girls’ Demonstration Work, U. S. 
Department of Agriculture. 
In our brief discussion of this subject, we shall limit our theme to the ac- 
tivities which can be a source of profit for women and girls in rural homes. 
In times past, there has been a marked neglect both of furnishing informa- 
tion and of giving training which should help the girl in any employment in 
the country. So, in her leisure moments or when taxed with unskilled work 
done with crude appliances and without apparent profit, she has turned toward 
the town—and everything has been done to focus attention on town and city 
employment. Happily, times have changed and there is now a fine de- 
velopment of opportunity and accompanying this, the skilled instruction 
necessary for successful ventures in money-making activities for girls and 
women on the farm. We need only to give records of our girls’ canning clubs 
in the southern States for 1913 to show the possibilities of such instruction 
and the results to individual workers. There were 4,202 girls between the 
ages of ten and eighteen years whose products from garden and home can- 
nery made a total value of $180,420.05. These girls produced more than a 
million cans of vegetables, and in addition found ready market for fruit 
products also. The time used in producing this wealth was the vacation hours 
of children. Moreover, it was accompanied by delightful intercourse of 
group workers, by healthful out-of-door activity and by the fine consciousness 
of achievement and the ability to exploit environment and use door-yard 
resources. Ten Mississippi girls in 1913, made a total profit of $868.66 
from the tenth-acre gardens at an average cost of $29.93 each. 
In addition to the field instruction given to girls and women through 
demonstration work instanced above, which has resulted in profitable em- 
ployment, we have another admirable development in the short course for 
women and girls which many of our colleges of agriculture and industrial 
schools have recently established, not only to instruct leaders in this work, 
but to give further training to girls who have proved their efficiency and who 
cannot yet attend longer courses of instruction.: These short courses have 
included instruction in poultry raising, horticulture and dairying. A college 
for women in one of our southern States which has emphasized industrial
-P-A-G-E-47
  
WoMEN’s CONFERENCE 43 
training, is now establishing a poultry farm where her students shall be able 
to learn the industry from a practical standpoint. I could add many other 
instances of notable opportunity for training in these occupations. 
I have thus dwelt upon the development of opportunity for instruction and 
training because, in considering the field in which women and girls on the 
farm may make a competence or earn pin money, it is necessarily limited 
to the lighter branches of agriculture, to those activities demanding skill 
rather than than physical strength. In these, we shall include such divisions 
of horticulture as small fruits, vegetable gardening, flower gardening both of 
hardy varieties and of greenhouse kinds; poultry raising; dairying and bee- 
keeping. Time is lacking to enumerate here the successful experiences of 
women whom we know, who have tried one and another of these occupations. 
Since many of you here today are leaders in our demonstration work for girls 
and women, and all are interested in these problems and are in position to 
advise those who wish to turn their attention to some of these occupations, 
it is worth while to formulate some fundamental ideas on which to build. 
First, it must be recognized that success comes as a result of skill, and that 
we must get the best information to be had; this is not out of reach of anyone 
who realizes the need of it. Second, find lines of work suited to the locality 
and to the individual, then develop some specialty of real excellence. Third, 
be content to make a small beginning, and master difficulties, step by step. 
Fourth, plan, even in a féw intensive operations, to give diversity and variety 
of employment, giving each season its work. Fifth, encourage the same 
work among small groups of women who shall co-operate in developing some 
product of known excellence, uniformity, and devise an attractive form for 
marketing. This may begin in as simple a way as keeping the same variety 
of chickens so that eggs of uniform kind may be marketed together. Then 
establish contact with those who need this commodity and want the qualities 
named above. Sixth, be ready to use modern helps in marketing, like the 
parcel post, automobile travel, etc. 
Using these ideas and others which thoughtful experience will enable 
us to find, we may develop the opportunities I have briefly indicated in 
attractive and profitable ways. 
ACCOUNT OF PARCEL POST MARKETING DEMONSTRATION. 
Mr. Lewis B. Flohr, Scientific Assistant of the Office of Markets, United 
States Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C., conducted, in co-opera- 
tion with the parcel post exhibit of the Louisville post-office, an exhibit of 
parcel post shipments such as are being made by Mr. Flohr in his study 
and tryout of shipping various farm products by parcel post. 
Mr. Flohr has completed a study of shipping eggs from producer direct to 
consumer by parcel post, and had as a part of his exhibit, eight parcels, with a 
total of twenty-eight dozens of eggs, which he had shipped from Washington, 
D. C., to Louisville for the exhibit. Every one of the eight parcels arrived in 
very good condition. The containers consisted of two thicknesses of corrugated 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  
44 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
pasteboard, supplied with fillers or compartment partitions of the same 
material. Each egg was wrapped with sufficient paper to hold it snugly in 
its individual compartment. 
One interesting feature of the exhibit was a combination container, made 
for three dozen eggs, four pounds of butter, and one large or two small chickens 
(dressed), but which had been shipped from Atlanta, Ga., with three dozen 
eggs, several pounds of tomatoes, and a half dozen large stalks of celery. 
This container could be used for eggs and any other assortment of produce 
desired. 
Another interesting and instructive feature of this exhibit was forty pounds 
of butter in two, three, five and ten-pound parcels, the outer containers con- 
sisting of the same material as those used for the eggs. The cartons for the 
butter consisted of the ordinary one-pound manilla, paraffined carton and 
metal ones of different kinds, which are being given a thorough trial to dem- 
onstrate what will meet the requirements most satisfactorily. Twenty pounds 
of the butter was shipped from Washington, D. C., on April 4 and awaited 
Mr. Flohr’s arrival at the Armory on the 7th; this was in very satisfactory 
condition. Eight pounds arrived on the 8th, and twelve pounds on the 9th, 
from a creamery in Pennsylvania—in the far part of the fourth zone from 
Louisville. This was packed in the same way as the other consignments, 
and all arrived in good condition. 
There were also arriving each day parcels of vegetables shipped from 
Washington, D. C., and from Atlanta, Ga., some with but one commodity, 
such as kale or tomatoes, in the parcel, and other parcels consisting of an 
assortment of vegetables such as would be desirable for a family. These 
practically all arrived in good condition. 
There was also in the exhibit a sixteen-quart berry crate and a twenty-four- 
quart berry crate, such as are mailable within the first and second zones. 
These are supplied (according to the postal regulations) with tight bottoms 
and do not need to be wrapped in paper, as must all packages weighing 
twenty pounds or less. They are handled outside of mail sacks in about the 
same manner as express matter. 
Mr. Flohr took pleasure in explaining the exhibit and answering questions 
in regard to the practicability and utility of marketing direct from producer 
to consumer by parcel post. The exhibit of eggs, butter, tomatoes, kale, 
spinach, lettuce, squash, cauliflower, onions, salsify, radishes, celery, etc., 
bore evidence to the practical utility of the parcel post, as all of this exhibit 
had been received through the mails over much longer distances than would 
ordinarily be traveled by parcel-post marketing.

  WomMeEn’s CONFERENCE 45 
THE HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS OF THE COUNTRY WOMAN. 
Miss Mabel C. Williams, Memphis, County Superintendent of Schools, Shelby 
County, Tenn. 
“Who is-the greatest woman in history?” was the query debated by a body 
of school teachers recently. They considered Joan of Arc, Queen Elizabeth, 
Semiramis, Cleopatra, Cornelia, Catherine of Russia, Maria Theresa, Grace 
Darling, Florence Nightingale, Susan B. Anthony, and half a hundred others. 
When they came to deciding, all the names known to fame were ruled out; 
and to whom do you suppose the judges awarded the palm? Here is the an- 
swer: ‘The wife of the farmer of moderate means who does her own cooking, 
washing, ironing and sewing, brings up a family of boys and girls to be useful 
members of society, and finds time for intellectual improvement.” 
You have given me a big subject to talk about. That woman is the mother 
of many of the men and women before me today. 
Back to the land! It is a popular cry—raised by agitators concerned for 
themselves who want someone else to do the going back. The wonderful 
profits to be gotten from the soil, the machinery that works tirelessly, the 
science that makes certain the reward of energy; these have all been glowingly 
pictured. But what of the woman in the farmhouse? Has it been said of 
her that her days will be full of toil, her life lonely, her outlook limited to a 
small circle of women as tired as herself? No prospectus mentions these things, 
because they are the things responsible for the drift to the cities. How can 
the drift be turned back? Nobody knows, but everybody does know that it 
will not be accomplished until something is done to put the farm woman on 
an equality with the woman of the city, an equality of labor. Given that, 
the position of the farm woman is enviable. Economically, she is of extreme 
importance. The farmer must have his wife and children. The nation, if 
it is is to remain virile, must have its constant stream of blood fresh from the 
soil. 
The market basket, to be filled at all, must have the product of the country 
woman’s work—her eggs, her butter, her chickens. Now, give her a square 
deal, give her the advantage of the progress of science and the woman on 
the farm will stop the drift to the cities. 
This drift to the city has been largely a woman movement. The men on 
the farms are much more contented than the women. While the men rejoice 
in the freedom and independence of the life, the women are pining for neigh- 
bors, for domestic help, for schools, music, art and books. So here we have 
one of our greatest problems related back to the eight or tenth person in our 
population who happens to be a farm woman. 
Our agricultural life has been falling to pieces; the fragments have been 
sucked to the cities; the pride of the nation once lay in its sturdy farmers; 
from their ranks came our statesmen, our scholars, our financiers. The iron 
in the nation’s blood came from the blades of scythes and sickles and the 
polish from its plow shares. The farmers fought our battles, and built our 
railroads and our bridges. They have been the soldiers of progress, and un- 
less we can still maintain a farm life in which the greatnesses of American 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
    
46 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
life can flowér, the armies of progress will suffer that decadence which comes 
to the hosts of any nation when they come from pavements instead of from 
meadows and plowed fields. 
The farm woman must have better things in the order of their nearness 
to her daily life; first, things in the house for her housekeeping; secondly, 
things in the home for her children’s happiness and fuller home life, and 
thirdly, things outside the house in the neighborhood for the better and fuller 
community life of herself, her children, her husband and her neighbors. This 
is the outline of the rural uplift which is gathering force every day. 
The American farm women constitute our largest class of economically 
useful women. This is shown by the fact that marriage is regarded as a burden 
by the poor man in the city, but is almost a necessity for the poor man who 
owns and works a farm. 
The poultry products of the nation are worth as much as the cotton crop, 
exceed the wheat crop by $400,000,000 yearly, and are worth more than the 
combined values of the oat, rye, barley and potato crops. 
This enormous product, if lost to us, would be felt ruinously at once in 
increased cost of living. It must be credited mainly to the woman of the 
farm. For she it is who produces nine-tenths of the poultry products, the 
fowls and the eggs of the nation. . Give her also credit for butter, cheese, 
vegetables, pickles, preserves and a thousand other things; allow her too, 
her share in preparing meals for men who grow the rest of the food for us, 
and also for keeping their houses. 
Remember also that she bears our sturdiest children while she feeds us 
all. And then ask yourself who has done anything for the farm woman? 
She has been left to shift for herself and must still do so. She still bakes her 
own bread; she still scrubs her own floors; she washes her own dishes; she 
cans and preserves and dries her own fruit and vegetables. She has bent faith- 
fully, dutifully and uncomplainingly over these appointed tasks while with the 
rhythmic swing of its pounding machinery the march of modern progress has 
borne class after class out beyond her. But she is alive to the higher duty 
before her. 
When, however, the tired and harassed farm wife comes to the point of 
asking herself whether it is worth while to stay on the farm, she thinks sec- 
ondarily of the disadvantages of work and living which have frazzled her 
nerves and depressed her spirits. She thinks first of her children. That is 
the eternal mother. She finds that the children are in most parts of the 
country, deprived of the school advantages and social advantages which the 
city gives even to the slum dweller. 
In Shelby county we have met this need of better school advantages by 
consolidation and transportation of pupils and the building of $350,000.00 
worth of schools in the past five years. We have thirty-three wagons running 
in Shelby county which carry something like 800 country children to school 
daily. We have fourteen high schools, and a high-school education is within 
the reach of every child in Shelby county. 
Let me tell you of one particular rural school which is eight miles from any 
railroad. 
. The people of the community donated five acres of land upon which to
-P-A-G-E-51
  
WoMEN’s CONFERENCE 47 
build it. We had architects who made a special study of school architecture 
to plan the building. It has its own deep well, pump and engine, its septic 
tank, sewerage system, sanitary drinking fountains in the house and yard, 
steam heat, slate blackboards, in fact, we did not leave out any convenience 
that we could think of to make this a modern school in the way of lighting, 
heating, ventilating, sanitation and beauty. The building and equipment 
cost $38,000.00. Three wagons run to this school, bringing an average of 
ninety children daily. The total enrollment is 250. Seven teachers are 
teaching the twelve grades in this school. The three teachers in the high school 
departments are college graduates. We pay the principal $150.00 per month, 
the two assistants $80.00 each. We pay the grade teachers $60.00 per month, 
all of whom have the equivalent of a good high school education, supplemented 
by study at the Summer School of the South, and the West Tennessee State 
Normal School. 
We have a girls’ tomato club worker, paid a salary of $60.00 per month, 
who visits this school regularly and has a large club of girls working under her 
direction. Not only does this school own its canning outfit, but many house- 
keepers in the community have them also. 
We have a supervisor of corn club work, a graduate of A. & M. College 
of Mississippi, to whom we pay a salary of $150.00 per month. He visits this 
school regularly, instructing a large club of boys in the art and science of 
raising corn and other farm products on their own land. 
We have a supervisor of primary work, trained at Teachers’ College, to 
whom we pay $1,200.00 a year, who visits this school and supervises the first 
three grades especially, and incidentally gives much aid from her valuable 
experience to any of the grades. That primary supervisor, Miss Marianna 
March, is with me at this conference. She will go from here to Baltimore 
county, Maryland, to investigate the system of rural supervision which we 
have been told is the best to be seen. As soon as she gets back we shall put 
into practice in Shelby county all the newer and better ways of doing things 
she learned in Baltimore county. Then some day some one may come to 
investigate us. 
We have a chairman of the Board of Education; paid a salary of $1,500.00, 
who visits this school regularly, looking after the proper up-keep of the build- 
. ing and grounds. And lastly, the county superintendent, whose salary is 
$2,750.00, has visited that school four times this year and will go back to 
commencement next week, a function she has not missed for five years. 
There will be several days and nights of this, and people will come for miles 
and miles to attend it. We have a large auditorium seating several hundred 
people, a properly constructed stage, with dressing rooms on each side, con- 
nected by a passageway at the back. A unique feature of the arrangements 
for commencement last year was a nursery fitted up with a couple of beds and 
a good old-fashioned negro mammy to take care of the sleepy babies. 
This school maintains a large class in music, both vocal and instrumental, 
as well as a class in expression. There will be a girls’ oratorical contest, a 
boys’ declamatory contest, a piano and voice recital, and one night will prob- 
ably be devoted to a play such as ‘Priscilla and John Alden,” with its historical
-P-A-G-E-52
48 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
setting and costume. We advise that these plays be selected from the approved 
lists for high school students. 
Last commencement was the first one held in the new school building. 
The people of the community made up the money to install an electric light 
plant. It was finished barely in time for the first entertainment. When the 
footlights flashed on, the children on the stage were so overcome with the 
wonder of it, they forgot to sing and stood gazing at the footlights with open 
mouths and eyes until they were reminded to proceed. 
This school has a regular course of entertainments provided either by the 
school or by outside talent throughout the year. There is a victrola in the 
neighborhood, which is sometimes brought to the school. The young people 
who are no longer in the school enjoy very much getting up plays and enter- 
tainments and give the proceeds of a twenty-five cent admission fee toward 
paying for a piano and the library fund. For this school has a room fitted 
up as a library and quite a number of books and all worth-while current maga- 
zines, which are open to the whole community. 
There are tennis and basketball courts on the school grounds; the school 
has a splendid girls’ basketball team, as well as the boys’ team. Through the 
athletic association of the county schools, games are arranged between the 
various schools and much school pride is manifested. 
Since the contract for that building was let a rural bank has been organized 
and built near the school. A system of telephones has been installed at a rate 
within the reach of all, which puts these people not only in touch with their 
neighbors, but the whole world. One woman told me, “I don’t feel lonesome 
now when I am by myself, for I can call up the neighbors and talk to them. 
It’s just like having someone with me all the time.” As I said before, this 
place is eight miles from a railroad, making it rather inaccessible. So these 
people have bought and are operating an auto truck which carries passengers 
and freight with equal facility and speed, and makes three trips a day to the 
railway station, thus allowing people to make the trip to Memphis without 
taking a horse out of the crop for a whole day during the busy season. 
Since this new school building has been put up, land values have increased. 
Much property has been bought and sold in small tracts and people are moving 
to Rosemark to get the advantage of this fine school. It is the vital spot 
around which the social life of the community centers. The poorest farmer 
realizes that his children have as good if not better, advantages than any child 
in city or town. : 
I have mentioned this school merely as a type of our best rural schools. 
We have many others like it in the county. No one there thinks we have 
been partial to this particular community. 
We spent $200,000.00 in two years building rural and small town schools, 
not one of which was within ten miles of Memphis. This money came from 
the first bond issue for schools ever granted in the county. While we have 
urgent needs for school buildings near the city of Memphis, I determined this 
money should go to making life more attractive for country people. We 
built ten schools with this $200,000.00. They exceed in beauty and con- 
venience the wildest dreams of those people as to what a school should be. 
They are rising to meet this new standard of convenience placed in their
-P-A-G-E-53
WoMEN’s CONFERENCE 49 
midst and in every case the new school has made a marked difference in the 
social life of the community. 
I do not believe with some that the country school should be a purely dis- 
tinctive type of school. People of the country do not want all their culture 
in terms of pigs and corn and tomatoes. America is too democratic to foster 
a distinctive class of farm people. You cannot keep people on the farm by 
attempting to educate them in terms of farm life only. The desirable citizens 
in the country are those who live on the farm through choice. 
Good roads are another need of country life. This need is met very ade- 
quately in Shelby county by 700 miles of gravelled road. This makes possible 
a splendid system of rural routes and facilitates the transportation of school 
children. 
Of course, the woman on the farm needs more money just like the rest of 
us. These various co-operative and rural credit organizations that are being 
agitated here will see to that, however. The farmer’s wife needs more con- 
veniences in her home, she needs magazines which show her how to make 
her clothes, furnish her house in good taste, and feed her family a simple 
balanced ration at the lowest cost. She needs to know how other women have 
solved problems similar to her own. She needs to study household efficiency, 
to know the relative value of the various tasks that make up her day and which 
ones she may best leave out. 
When I see the splendid conveniences arranged in the exhibit here for 
helping the farm woman, I am so sorry she is not here to see them. They are 
wasted on all these school people and city dwellers. You may think we have 
too many organizations already, but I want to urge that the Department of 
Agriculture establish farm women’s co-operative demonstration work, just 
as they have established this work for the farmer. She has no special place 
in this scheme of rural uplift. We have the farmer’s co-operative demonstra- 
tion work, the boys’ corn club work, the girls’ tomato club work, but what 
about the woman on the farm? 
I do not believe that this work should be put upon the schools. The coun- 
try school teacher is almost as overworked as the woman on the farm. 
If a broad-minded, sympathetic, capable woman could go into a community 
and get these women interested, make a simple home like those of the majority 
of the women, show them how to arrange what they have to the best advantage 
and gradually get these women to make their homes demonstration places, 
just as the farmer co-operates with the agricultural agents, would not this 
be the best way of reaching that large class of farm women who have reared 
their families and have no one in touch with the schools? When we go to 
help these women, let us go in a spirit of humility and broad sympathy, 
recognizing that there are so many things they know how to do far better 
than we know, recognizing the great work that they have accomplished and 
are still doing for this country, and realizing that they are too precious to 
spend their lives in useless drudgery that might be lightened. 
When I looked into the face of that mountain woman who has charge of 
the exhibit from Berea College, when I read the sterling character, the intel-
-P-A-G-E-54
50 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
ligence and the courage written there, I said to myself, “Is it any wonder 
that our brave mountain boys fought and won the battle of King’s Mountain 
and independence for America?” 
WHAT THE FARM-WOMAN WANTS AND NEEDS. 
Miss Eva Reichardt, Little Rock, State Organizer of School Improvement Work. 
The rural home can be improved in its industrial, economic, religious and 
social life by a get-together school of farmers’ wives, parallel to that given the 
fathers by the university extension schools. I do not speak from a boastful 
spirit in presuming to state the needs of farm women; but rather from a spirit 
of sincere humility brought about by my own observations and experiences 
during six years of fording streams and trailing along roads which lead down 
and up, over and about pine-topped hills, to the home twenty-five miles 
from the railroads and meeting not only one such woman, but thousands, 
in my visits to the many schools. The evidence thus secured is the basis of 
my belief that heart-to-heart talks around the fireside “beat” any sociology 
one ever found on the pages of any philosophy or in any constitution. 
If you followed the farm-woman from breakfast by candle-light, through 
the day, to the woodpile, out to the milking, to the churning, across to the 
garden, down to the spring, returning with a bucket of water on each arm, 
to dishwashing and housecleaning, on to the preserving, on with the cooking 
of dinner, down to the quilting, and thus through the day of innumerable, 
recurrent and varying tasks and duties, to a supper by candle-light, you 
would have had a lesson, rather a series of lessons, in dynamics—so much of 
which is wasted energy for this human dynamo. Practically all that is com- 
pensatory for this good woman are her comforts, and they are about the same 
descending from mother to daughter—very little improved. What does 
she want? This woman on the farm, what does she need? 
Although long ignored, this is the vital, burning question that must be met 
and answered in this great country, whose future depends to such a great 
extent on rural development. 
What can be done for the wife of the farmer of today and for the mother 
of the farmer of tomorrow—the mother of the strength of the nation, if you 
please, for her sons do not, and under no conditions will not, all remain on 
the farm—the sons of farm mothers are found in all walks of life, many of 
them in highest positions of honor, trust and service. The farm-woman’s 
needs are of grave concern to Arkansas and to the nation. 
Away off from the railroad I found a bright-eyed little woman and two 
chubbie babies—perhaps some day presidents, qualified electors certainly, 
for both are boys. At evening the father came in. The home was plain 
and neat, but not attractive with material furnishing. The happy family 
and the generous hospitality made it a pleasant rest. The mother was still 
fresh and young, and with great hopes for the future.

WoMEN’s CONFERENCE Sue 
She was going down to the capital city with her husband to attend the 
grand lodge. This trip, I am inclined to believe, was about the greatest event 
since, as a bride, she had crossed the mountain to make a new home. She 
looked with admiration at her guest’s peg-top, plaid skirt, made by A-1, 
Delineator pattern. Her approval evoked the story of the skirt. The sug- 
gestion of making came from the display of a similar skirt in the window of 
a Philadelphia shop, which her guest had seen that September in passing 
through from the seashore. She had remembered that thirty years ago her 
father on his return visit from abroad had brought the beautiful wool plaid 
goods to mother. Mother’s economy made three capes, one for herself and 
two for the two little girls. Cousin Mary had made mother’s two-piece 
plaid cape with a silk hgod and tassel. That cape must be some place away 
down in the cedar chest. The first effort after unpacking the trunk for the 
summer trip was to dive down into that cedar chest and find the cape—and 
there it was! Packed for twenty years, now brought to light! With a modern 
pattern, a spool of silk thread and hooks and eyes, the old cape was fashioned 
at a cost of twenty-five cents into a new and stylish garment with a value of 
twenty-five dollars. The seam down the center of the skirt was the same that 
Cousin Mary had made twenty years ago. 
The making of one’s new dresses is part of what the organizer of school 
improvement would have the schools teach, when household arts are taught 
in every rural school. 
The good of it all was startling to this charming country woman, but she 
was quick to catch the inspiration. 
It was all very fine! Then she went over to the old tin trunk in the corner— 
and from its depths produced a beautiful piece of plaid cloth—it had a history, 
too. Father had returned with it from Kansas City from one of his trips 
selling cattle. Could such a miracle be made for her—a skirt? 
It was only five days until the time for starting to the grand lodge, and since 
neither she nor her guest could cut the skirt without a pattern, the thought 
of a new plaid skirt had to be abandoned. 
Again, she reached under the bed and pulled out a hat box disclosing a 
velvet hat of voluminous shape, which was enough material for two hats, 
if one only had a fashion journal to give suggestions. 
She made her trip in her old‘ clothes down to the grand lodge. She and her 
husband joined his brother and wife, who lived in a town on the railroad 
where they had a Delineator and Ladies’ Home Journal for sale——and 
this wife had new clothes. But the courageous little woman, keenly conscious 
of the disparity of clothes, came down to the big capital city of the State and 
enjoyed “some things.”” What do you think we might attempt for our isolated 
sister? 
The school improvement organizer traveling thousands of miles a year, 
may help her a little. The girls’ canning club organizers will help a little, 
too, with the girls in the home. What the farm woman wants is direct help 
not only that her daughter bring ideas from the canning club and the school 
—not only second-hand ideas from her husband’s attendance at the farmers’ 
extension course in his county. ‘ 
What she deserves is that the farmers’ extension course include farmers’

wives. While the men are off in their meeting, she could attend one, directed 
by an educated, experienced, practical, woman, who herself has done the 
things she is teaching. That teaching should be the exploiting of good house- 
hold journals, their pattern departments; cooking; art; the decorating of the 
home with artistic taste; dispensing with much useless decorations, which 
are dust catchers; first aid to the injured; sanitation; exhibiting labor-saving 
devices; and then, among others, but very important, the use of the parcel 
post in bringing her products to the city market. Teach her the value of her 
own labor and the value of a check book—and, most important of all, the 
teaching, so woefully neglected, that she should have as the mother. 
What does she need? Educational development; intimate knowledge of 
herself and the laws of right living; labor-saving devices; comforts; activities 
that carry with them social life for herself and her children; to know how to 
do things she must do, with better ease; to fashion her own clothes after the 
style of the ‘‘Delineator;” to make her own hats by the suggestions of the 
“Ladies’ Home Journal;’ to keep her house well with the aid of “Good House- 
keeping;” to know that her children are getting a square deal educationally 
and that she has some part in bringing about this condition; and, lastly, 
when it is evening to sit down and rest with the “Country Gentleman” for 
a good companion—that is her right. 
COMMUNITY WORK FOR THE HOME. 
Miss Helen Kinne, Teachers’ College, Columbia University, New York City. 
On Tuesday afternoon my talk before the Conference of Country Women 
dealt with the meaning of the study of the household arts to the individual 
housekeeper. My thought today is essentially the same, that the study of 
home conditions and management will make for the physical efficiency of 
the individual and for the economy of labor and money; that it will eventuate 
in a higher standard of living on the material side and will strengthen the 
home as an ethical and spiritual center in the community. Today I wish to 
emphasize the thought that it is necessary for the women of a community 
to work together for the good of all. In fact, co-operation is the keynote here 
as in all our other activities at the present day. May I suggest first certain 
possibilities that are more or less dreams at present and yet which may be 
fulfilled if we can but see the need? I am reminded of a thought that I have 
had in mind for many years which occurred to me one day when I read an 
item concerning a farmers’ club on Long Island. The farmers’ club had studied 
bulletins published by the U. S. Department of Agriculture, had made out 
their own formula for fertilizer and had sent for bids to a number of fertilizer 
firms. This is, of course, no longer a new thing. It caught my attention at 
the time because I had been familiar with conditions on Long Island years 
ago, when fish scraps were used lavishly for fertilizer, sometimes intelligently 
and sometimes not. It occurred to me to ask the question as to what the
-P-A-G-E-57
       -WoMEN’S CONFERENCE 33 
farmers’ wives were doing, and the answer to my question was that the farmers’ 
wives had not advanced beyond the fish-scrap stage. 
Take, for instance, the question of flour. Why is it necessary for the house- 
keeper to take the flour that the grocer offers her without question? Why 
should not a group of women study the question of bread flour, decide what 
combination of wheat they want to use, whether or not they want their flour 
bleached and send their bids to the grocer or to the manufacturer? That is 
to say, why will it not be possible through co-operation for women to control 
the quality and nature of their own food supply? The question of co-opera- 
tion in buying and the abolishing of the middleman, is, of course, a difficult 
one to settle. I shall never forget an experience that I once had when I recom- 
mended the women in a certain club to send away to the wholesale dealer 
for certain of their supplies. The wife of the local grocer arose in her wrath 
and asked me how I supposed the grocer could live if all his trade were taken 
away? There are, of course, two sides to this question. I learned, however, 
that the grocer in question was charging his customers an exorbitant price, 
and that such a method as had been recommended might be a most salutary 
lesson. Certainly it is important to patronize local trade and yet the dealer 
must be fair. Why, for instance, in a small town, should coffee be purchased * 
at thirty-two, thirty-five or even forty-five cents a pound, when much better 
flavored coffee can be bought for twenty-five cents in a neighboring town, 
costing less by parcel post than the local coffee? It is my purpose this summer 
to give the local grocer an opportunity to furnish this kind of coffee and, if 
he is not willing, to suggest to a number of women that we form a club for 
purchasing coffee and other articles in New York City. Whatever your 
opinion may be at present of this suggestion, it is evident at least that here 
is a subject for study in the small community or in a group of farm women. 
In the field of sanitation it is easy to see that only through co-operation 
can we bring about desired results. Take, for instance, the question of the 
fly and the mosquito. What matters it how clean one’s own premises may be 
and how well the house is screened, if the next-door neighbor. is neglectful 
of his stable and his swamp? We must get rid of the fly and the mosquito 
together, which, of course, means that each individual must clean up his own 
place, and that where the community is concerned community work is ab- 
solutely necessary. Of course, the question of money is all-important in this 
connection. Someone said to me this morning, “How can I tell a man to 
screen his house when he is financially embarrassed and cannot get the ready 
cash?” It is here, of course, that the discussions of the business men at this 
conference are so encouraging and that the work of the canning clubs for 
girls and other agencies for earning money are so important. The whole 
question of the disposal of waste is also a community problem. Some women’s 
clubs in towns are very energetic in having a clean-up day, dumping the refuse 
beside country roads and making other people’s premises unsightly. The 
solution of the problem must go deeper than this. Every kind of waste, 
sewage, ashes, tin cans, should be studied by the woman and the problem 
of disposal forced upon the town meeting until some solution is worked out. 
In the matter of beauty of home surroundings and of the town we cannot 
accomplish very much without mutual understanding. The care of the   
-P-A-G-E-58
  54 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
wayside, the planting and spraying of trees—all are necessary. Remember 
the birds, too. If each woman at home will supply a bird bath, food for the 
birds, see that bird houses are put in the trees, and do away with stray cats, 
wonders can be accomplished for the town and farm. This, of course, is im- 
portant to the agriculturist as well as to the lover of beauty. 
More than all, the home-makers must work together for raising the moral 
standard of the town. If there is a moving picture show make sure that your 
boys and girls do not see the vulgarity that is often displayed. The moving 
picture, properly used, is one of the most delightful of amusements and also 
truly educational. There are fly films that teach practical lessons, and one 
film is in existence that shows the progress of a forest fire from the picnic 
party to the desolated home with the family standing around its ruins. There 
are many films of historic and literary value and others that give attractive 
plays entirely devoid of coarseness. 
One of the most encouraging features of this conference is the time and 
thought that is being given to the rural church. One minister’s wife told me 
this morning that the church in her home town is to be open seven days 
in the week, meeting all kinds of community needs. Taking into account 
the great moral questions that confront us, is it not time for us to forget 
our denominational differences and work together for a revivified spiritual 
life? You will recall that it was said of the early Christians that they had all 
things in common. Is it not this spirit that we need at present to develop? 
Is not this the dream of democracy, the hope of our country, and the realiza- 
tion of the Christian ideal? ’ 
HELPING THE COMMUNITY THROUGH THE SCHOOL. 
Miss Susie V. Powell, State Organizer, School Improvement Associations, 
Jackson, Miss. 
A study of wheat or corn is more important to the southern boy than for 
him to be able to name the plants of the frigid zone. A knowledge of the his- 
tory, habits, and care of live-stock is worth more to him than to know the 
names of the huge animals that prowl through the jungles of the torrid zone. 
The one may be every bit as cultural as the other. 
The industrial clubs for boys and girls should be made a department of 
the county teachers’ association and the regular school work. The opportun- 
ities for correlating the school work with the club work are many and obvious. 
The canning club girl, who is taught how to measure accurately her one-tenth 
acre plat and lay it off according to direction and estimate the amount of 
soil she is cultivating, six or eight or twelve inches deep, is learning mensura- 
tion in a thorough and practical manner. When she keeps an exact account 
of the cost of her plat, including rent, fertilizer, work at ten cents an hour, 
and the cost of canning supplies; and from the proceeds of her club work es- 
timates her gain or loss, she will certainly learn profit and loss, percentage 
and accounts in a manner she will never forget.

  WoMEN’s CONFERENCE 50: 
When she makes daily observations of her plants, the effect of rain, drouth 
and wind on the leaf, stem, flowers and fruit, and the diseases and pests that 
attack them, she is learning nature study and geography as well as practical 
agriculture. When she composes the written history of her crop and writes 
an account of her work as a club member, she prepares an English composi- 
tion that calls for a knowledge of spelling, capitals, punctuation and the right 
use of words and paragraphing, just as if she had written on Faith, Hope and 
Charity. . 
When she learns that bacteria and spores are in the vegetables and develop 
rapidly and spoil the fruit unless thoroughly sterilized and hermetically sealed; 
when she learns of the needs for vegetables and fruits to supply a balanced 
ration, she is learning physiology pure and simple that she will remember 
when she has forgotten the number of bones in the body. When she learns 
the effect of light on vegetables, when she mixes zinc solder and muriatic 
acid to make the soldering flux, when she puts her capping steel into sal- 
ammoniac and solder and finds that it puts a silvery coating on the dark 
metal, when she studies the nature of the soil and determines what is needed 
in the form of fertilizer, whether lime, nitrogen or potash, she performs ex- 
periments in chemistry that cannot be excelled for practicability or culture 
in any college laboratory. 
When she reads the bulletins sent her by the Bureau of Plant Industry and 
the farm journals containing instructive articles on her club work, she is 
getting the thought from the printed page instead of merely calling words 
without reference to their meaning, as is often done in a formal reading lesson. 
When she enters into the club spirit, helps to elect officers or acts as one herself, 
carries out carefully the instructions sent her by those in authority, contri- 
butes the proceeds of her plat to the family income and to the wealth of her 
community, she is learning lessons in good citizenship and forming civic 
ideals that are more important than a knowledge of the meaning of gerry- 
mandering or the substance of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution. 
Everything I have said about the girls canning clubs, applies with equal 
force to corn clubs, pig clubs or poultry clubs, or cotton clubs. Our attitude 
toward these industries and clubs determines their cultural value. It is pos- 
sible for the child to learn unrelated facts about cotton, about lumber, or 
live-stock, with very little educational benefit. It is possible for the boy to 
till the soil or the girl to can tomatoes, and remain ignorant of the true value 
of the processes. Let me illustrate: Last summer at a canning demonstra- 
tion, among the club members who learned the simple process of sealing a 
can, were some of the most cultured women of the community. Looking 
after the fires and replenishing the water was the janitor, an ignorant man. 
At his request, he was shown how to tin the capping steel and tipping capper 
and seals and process the cans of tomatoes. Both the cultured women and the 
untutored man sealed the cans, the one as well as the other. But the woman 
with her previous knowledge of physiology, bacteriology and chemistry 
understood the principles involved and was able to apply them later, while 
the man remained ignorant of the real meaning of the processes involved and 
received no cultural benefit. It is only when we learn to think with the head, 
while we work with the hands, that we receive the highest benefit.

  56 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
‘The industrial clubs for boys and girls are brilliant examples of the power 
of co-operation. The canning club work in the three years of its existence, 
has achieved remarkable results. Beginning with only two counties in 1911, 
this year, thirty-three counties were organized and these club girls converted 
thousand of pounds of vegetable products that were going to waste into a 
marketable commodity; and still other thousands of gallons into palatable 
products for the home. 
At least a score of these club girls made sufficient money from their co- 
operative club work to enter college this fall and thus saw their opportunities 
broaden for useful and successful life. 
The club work has been known to change the fashions. I visited the south- 
western part of our State and drove down the historic Natchez Trace, between 
Cherokee hedge rows reaching to the tree tops. I visited the homes of some 
of the wealthiest and most cultured and influential people in the State, where 
we had club members. In every instance I was hardly in the house before 
my hostess would invite me to inspect her well-stocked pantry filled with home 
packed delicacies. One of these told me that before the club work was or- 
ganized, about the first thing shown a visitor was the fancy work, but that 
now the pantries come first, and at the social gatherings gossip had given 
place to an exchange of recipes and discussions of the club work. 
These industrial clubs have changed country schools into popular social 
centres, not only during the school term, but throughout the vacation, when 
heretofore the schools have suffered most from vandalism and neglect. The 
club meetings bring to the school not only the boys and girls, but the mothers 
and fathers, to study the plans and purposes of the club work, the methods of 
cultivating the crops and fighting plant diseases and pests. During vacation 
they meet there to hold their canning demonstrations and often become 
aware for the first time of the needs and deficiencies of the school, and hasten 
to supply these. In the fall they meet there to give reports of the work, ex- 
hibits, and judge the products and award prizes and listen to talks and ad- 
dresses on practical subjects. 
I have seen a group of stolid, timid country girls who were afraid of them- 
selves and their audience, taught a lively yell which embodied the spirit 
of co-operation, and afterwards summoned to the canning work which they 
accomplished with ease and dispatch. A uniform white cap and apron adopted 
by the club girls and worn at public demonstrations, taught them the lesson 
that housework and slouchiness in dress do not necessarily go hand in hand. 
We want an organization of patrons and pupils in each community under 
an active, interested, intelligent teacher, to crystallize public sentiment into 
actual school improvement. The local association should, in turn, keep in 
close touch with the county organization. The teacher should be a member 
of it and understand thoroughly its plans and purposes. He should study 
these plans and modify them to suit the local conditions and translate its 
purposes into the needs of the individual schools. He should interest his 
patrons and pupils in the industrial clubs and use these as one means of 
vitalizing the course of study and bringing his school in close touch with 
the lives of the people. He should invite the extension workers and experts 
to visit his school and instruct his pupils in health, agriculture, ete. He 
   
-P-A-G-E-61
  WoMEN’S CONFERENCE 57 
should use the bulletins supplied him for supplementary work on reading, 
agriculture, etc. He should bring all these forces to bear on the improve- 
ment of school and community, educate his people into the habit of looking 
to the school for help in solving their problems and coming to the school 
for a discussion of these. He will thus realize the modern pedagogue’s ideal 
of making the school the social centre of the community. 
BOYS’ AND GIRLS’ DEMONSTRATION WORK IN THE SOUTHERN 
STATES. 
O. B. Martin, Assistant in charge Boys’ and Girls’ Demonstration Club Work, 
U. S. Department of Agriculture. 
When one of our agents in the canning clubs had about finished her year’s 
work, she made the following observations on one of her weekly field reports: 
“After all, this canning club work means that we are to get a girl 
to do something worth while; have it approved by those she loves, and 
then lead on to greater things.” 
This was the last division of demonstration work planned and started by 
Dr. Seaman A. Knapp. He told some of the first lady agents that they must 
not go to a man’s house and tell him that they had come to teach his wife 
how to cook. He said any self-respecting man would resent that sort of a 
domestic science propaganda. He told the agents that they could organize 
the girls in the clubs; teach them a great deal about plant life in the garden; 
get into the back yard with the canning; go from there to the kitchen and 
pantry, and finally reach and influence the mother in her home. We now 
have 300 women in the South who are doing this very thing. Through the 
generous co-operation of college, State and county officials, and business men’s 
organizations, a great many of these women are working more than ten months 
in the year. We can see already how easy it is for them to promote various 
lines of home economies after they establish their leadership. 
This is the largest and most effective woman’s organization in the world 
working for the improvement of the farm home. I believe Dr. Knapp pointed 
the way for the solution of a great problem when he established this work. 
Last year 33,060 girls were enrolled. Each one cultivated and managed a 
garden of one-tenth of an acre. The main crop was tomatoes. Some of the 
girls branched out into growing other vegetables after they had been successful 
with tomatoes for one year. They not only looked after the products of this 
garden, but thousands of them put up berries, peaches and other fruits. Quite 
a number made a profit of more than $100.00 each on their gardens. It is 
wonderful how these girls develop the special resources of their sections 
after they had studied tomatoes carefully for one year and learned to grow 
and can them. In many places the girls are putting up beans, okra and beets; 
in some places mayhaw jelly; in others scuppernong jelly and grape juice; 
in others figs; in others cumquats, loquats and whatnots. In ten years’ 
   
-P-A-G-E-62
    
58 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
times we expect these girls to develop some great industries from productS 
which are now overlooked and neglected. 
The best record in the United States in this work was made by Clyde 
Sullivan, a little thirteen-year-old girl in Lowndes county, Ga. She produced 
5,354 pounds of tomatoes and made a profit of $132.39. The following five 
records show that Clyde Sullivan’s yield was not a freak, but that many other 
girls made fine records also: 
  Profit 
Lizzie Kelly, South Carolina. 4,375 Ibs... ... $ 73.83 
Erin Westbrook, Alabama. 3,365 Ibs... ... 88.25 
Isabel Davis, Florida. 3,086 Ibs... ... 108.14 
Sallie M. Strahan, Mississippi. 2,390 Ibs. . 145.25 
Annie Davis, Texas. 2,080 Ibs...... 113.36 
4,202 girls put up 1,300,286 cans of tomatoes and 522,147 cans of other 
products which were worth $180,420.05. These were the best, of course, 
but thousands of others did well also. 
We try to impress upon the boys and girls that their acre plots and the 
one-tenth acre gardens are just as much object lessons as any of the fifty-acre 
plots managed by their fathers as demonstrators. 
We had 91,196 boys in the corn clubs last year. A great deal of instruc- 
tion and inspiration emanated from all those little centers where each boy was 
writing his story of better agriculture upon the ground. We like to think 
of each one of the quarter of a million people—who are enrolled in this work 
in the south—as object lessons; as centers of influence and information; 
as the point in the lake where the pebble is dropped and from which the waves 
spread in all directions. This inspires us to urge every boy and girl and every 
man and woman to get the best results. 
We had nearly 400 boys who produced more than 100 bushels of corn to 
the acre apiece, and Walker Lee Dunson, of Alexander City, Ala., made the 
best record that has been made during the five years of corn club work in 
the south. It is one of the best records that has ever been made in the history 
of corn production. He grew 232.7 bushels at a cost of 19.9 cents a bushel. 
The records of the five boys standing next highest are not to be sneezed at. 
They are as follows: 
  J. Jones Polk, Mississippi. 214.9 bushels, at a cost of...... 21.4¢ 
J. Ray Cameron, North Carolina. 190.4 bushels, at a cost of. . 33.29¢ 
Edward J. Wellborn, Georgia. 181.72 bushels, at a cost of...... 30¢ 
Ernest M. Joye, South Carolina. 158.75 bushels, at a cost of...... 42¢ 
Henry Odor, Virginia. 154.028 bushels, at a cost of. . 24.560   
The results achieved by the boys in the corn clubs and by the girls in the 
canning clubs have suggested and encouraged some excellent work in other 
lines. Last year some marvelous results were secured with pig, baby beef 
and poultry clubs. This year all of these clubs are being continued and we 
have some fine work with potato, peanut and other clubs. 
Thus it will readily be seen what our agent meant when she said that we 
should “lead on to greater things.” There is no question about the advantages
-P-A-G-E-63
  WoMEN’s CONFERENCE 59 
resulting from the study of plant life and live-stock, but the beauty of it all 
is the development of manhood and womanhood, which comes from having 
these boys and girls, at their ages in life, form definite purposes and carry 
them out successfully. 
Some time ago an organization of business men in Louisville, Ky., offered 
a trophy to the corn clubs of the various southern States, who would show the 
best records of a team of ten boys at the Conference of Education in the South 
on April 10th. 
The Alabama corn clubs furnish the team of ten boys with the best records, 
although several of the other States did such fine work that the competition 
was close. There has never been a better set of records made since the corn 
club work was established, and it is doubtful whether the whole history of 
corn production can show any group of men and boys, in any State, who have 
done as well as these ten Alabama youngsters. They produced 1,718.3 bushels 
of corn on ten acres at an average cost of $.182 cents per bushel, or $31.73 
per acre. The average profit was $140.14 each. This means that a profit of 
$1.401.40 was made on ten acres estimating the corn at one dollar per bushel. 
As a matter of fact, much of the corn has been sold for seed at $2.00 to $3.00 
per bushel.

The ten canning club girls of Mississippi, who won the girls’ trophy for 
’ their State, produced 27,850 pounds of tomatoes from their tenth-acre gar- 
dens. From these plots, including other vegetables, these ten girls canned 
29,379 No. 2 cans of vegetables. The value of these products, including the 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  
60 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
vegetables used at home, was $1,179.92, and the total profit, $868.66. The 
average cost of gardening and canning per tenth acre was $29.93. 
The finest individual record in tomato growing in the United States in 
1913, was made by Miss Clyde Sullivan, a fourteen-year-old canning club 
member of Ousley, Ga., who produced 5,354 pounds of tomatoes on a tenth 
acre, and canned 2,254 No. 2 cans, 212 No. 3 cans, and made sixty pints of 
catsup. The entire receipts from this ten acre were $229.26, and the profit 
$132.39. 
The best county record is that of Etowah county, Ala., where 104 ‘girls 
reported more than 30,000 No. 3 cans of tomatoes, having a value of $3,600.

ears of corn that could be secured from the acres of the club members who 
produced the finest records. 
Ten boys from each State were also requested to send essays or booklet 
telling how they produced their crops. These papers were put on exhibit 
and attracted a great deal of attention from teachers, school officers and 
others. It was noted by hundreds of people that the young school boys can

in which they are greatly interested. 
A copy of the record of these groups of prize-winners was put on exhibit

Some thoroughbred pigs occupied conspicuous space at the exhibit and 
the visiting members of the pig and corn clubs engaged in judging contests 
with the ten-ear exhibits and the fine pigs as a basis. 
Enlarged photographs of the various features of the club work and of the 
operations of individual club members were conspicuously exhibited. In 
addition, a large moving picture machine was installed which illustrated all 
the phases of this work from the sowing of the tomato seed in hot-beds and 
the preparation of the acres for corn, up to the visit of the prize winners to the 
White House to the national capital. 
The demonstrations in girls’ club work were given with a team of county 
agents of. Kentucky as workers. Mrs. McKimmon had charge of the demon- 
stration of the canning of tomatoes and string beans. The workers for this 
demonstration were the eight newly-appointed county agents in charge of 
this work in Kentucky. The lack of experience in canning of these new agents

resulted in a demonstration showing how the department agents teach inex- 
perienced workers. The people present were given an opportunity to ask 
questions and receive detailed information in regard to methods of can- 
ning as well as methods of organizing the club work for girls. 
Miss Ola Powell had charge of the demonstration of the packing of preserves 
and canned goods in glass for the market. This demonstration taught the 
visitors the methods used in the packing of products of the southern States. 
The girls clubs are now putting up fig preserves and marmalade and other 
fruit products of the southern States. 
Exhibits typical of the various lines of work now being developed in the 
States from Maryland south to Florida and Texas showed a wide range of 
products canned in both glass and tin. The interest among the farm women 
at the Conference in canning was intense and many of them received much 
help from the club-work leaders through instruction in methods of canning. 
Exhibits of equipment were a valuable aid in this work. 
There were also exhibits of girls’ notebooks with the histories of their 
crops and work from all parts of the south. In addition to this, there were 
exhibits of uniforms, caps and aprons worn by the members of the girls’ 
clubs in their public demonstrations. 
About fifty county canning club agents attended voluntarily to get the 
benefits of the Conference, most of these being from Tennessee, Mississippi, 
North and South Carolina. Hundreds of delegates to the Conference from 
Louisville and all parts of the south, visited these exhibits and demonstra- 
tions throughout the entire period of four days. 
THE SUPER RURAL. 
Wm. Goodell Frost, President of Berea College, Berea, Ky. . 
The exhibit which Berea College makes today might be labeled ‘A Program 
for the Super-Rural People of the Southern Mountains.” 
The word rural is on many tongues today. No educational program is 
complete without it. But this state of affairs is of very recent origin. The 
word “rural” if I am correctly informed, first appeared on an educational 
program at the meeting of the National Education Association in Detroit. 
I was then asked to speak in one of the smaller sub-section on a rural theme. 
The substance of my address was this: ‘“‘If I were United States Commissioner 
of Education, I would devote myself to the backward States; if I were super- 
intendent of public instruction in any State, I would devote myself to the 
most remote counties; if I were county superintendent, I would concentrate 
my attention to the least promising districts; if I were a country school 
teacher, I would be sure to take care of the most obscure and unprogressive 
families in my district. What America needs is not to push the advance 
columns in the march, but to bring up the belated detachments. And you 
may be very sure that in some of these belated detachments we shall find some 
of the best material in our army.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
WomEN’'s CONFERENCE 63 
Now to some people rural life means automobiles and sunken gardens— 
simply city luxuries transplanted to the country. But the typical rural life 
is that shown in Whittier’s “Snowbound,” and Mrs. Stowe’s “Old Town 
Folks.” The characteristic of this rural condition is the intense family life, 
and the intimate but limited acquaintance with surrounding households. 
The farmer in a western State knows everybody within a radius of a half day’s 
travel, and his thought, influence and activities are largely limited to this 
circle. 
The super-rural condition in the mountains is the same thing intensified. 
Instead of having an acquaintance throughout a circle of twenty miles in 
diameter, the mountain man has acquaintance only ten miles up stream and 
ten miles down stream in a narrow valley. 
This life of isolation is a life of deprivation. ‘The people in the mountains 
often burn kerosene lamps without chimneys, simply because it is a delicate 
matter to carry a lamp twenty miles over mountain roads! 
And when we come to know the mountaineer intimately, we find that his 
peculiarities are almost never of the nature of degradation. They are honest 
survivals. The mountain people are living as all good people lived in earlier 
times. We visit Mount Vernon and see Washington’s loom house, soap house, 
saddle pockets, and we realize George Washington and Martha, his wife, 
would be much at home today in the primitive conditions of our southern 
mountains. The very fighting qualities which are so often brought up against 
the mountaineer are only an honest survival of old Saxon temper. In the 
days of Queen Elizabeth every man carried a sword. Have you thought 
what that meant? It meant that he did not depend upon the government 
to protect him except from some foreign invader, as the Spanish or French. 
He considered it his own business to defend his own honor, property and house- 
hold with his own right arm. It is in this spirit that the mountaineer carries 
agun. 
They ask us why, if our mountain friends are so capable and promising, 
they have settled in the mountains. The answer is simple. Everybody went 
west after the Revolutionary War. No man at that time could foresee the 
coming of the railroads. The northern pioneer was helped out by the Erie 
Canal. For in those earlier times ideas traveled by water. This Erie Canal 
probably did more for civilization than the Panama Canal can ever do. It 
connected New York City not only with western New York, but northern 
Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin. Thus the northern pioneer 
was kept in touch with civilization until the railway overtook him. 
The southern mountaineer is, as I have said a thousand times, our contem- 
porary ancestor. And it is our business to provide for this vast region the 
special educational adaptations which will make it as strong in America as 
Scotland is in Great Britain. The exhibit shows something of what Berea 
is trying to do for its 1,700 mountain students.

        FARMERS’ CONFERENCE 
THE FARMER’S CONFERENCE. 
Tur OPENING ADDRESS BY THE CHAIRMAN, Hon. J. N. CampEN, VERSAILLES, 
KENTUCKY. 
Ladies and Gentlemen: 
I wish to express my profound gratification at the honor and distinction I 
feel in being chosen to call this, the Seventeenth Educational Conference 
of the South, to order for business. There is no doubt in my mind, and I do 
not hesitate to say, that this will take rank as one of the most important 
conventions of any nature ever held at any time in the confines of this State. 
The subject of thought, discussion and action upon which this Conference 
revolves, is one that for imperative reasons, is absorbing the most earnest 
attention and endeavor of the world today. 
In a paper as brief as this must be, it will only be possible to merely touch 
the several headings of this great subject, such as Agricultural Finance, 
Distribution, Production and Soil Enrichment. A large bulletin could be 
prepared on each theme. 
AGRICULTURAL FINANCE. 
  The present administration considers Agricultural Finance of such great 
significance that special legislation is being framed to help in that direc- 
tion. One of the greatest menaces to the future stability of this country 
is the congestion of the cities and the decreasing farm population. Any step 
on the part of our government that would give the landless man a home in 
the country and make him a producer instead of a consumer, would be wise 
and patriotic. The increasing tendency of the tenant system with its accom- 
panying train of evils to the land and to the disadvantage of the tenant him- 
self, is another grave menace. In 1880, 25.6% of all farms were operated by 
tenants. In 1910, 37%. In 1890, the improved acres per farm averaged 
72.2% of the whole. In 1910, the improved acres per farm averaged 75.1%, 
an increase in twenty years of only 2.9% of improved acres. 
The average debt per farm in 1890 was $1,224, while in 1910 it was $1,715, 
an increased farm mortgage in twenty years of 38.8% per farm. It seems 
advisable that the States buy and reclaim the waste places and sell in lots of 
fifteen to thirty acres, at cost and interest, on long-time payments to small 
tenant farmers, so they can own their own farms, live on them and work out 
the payments. 
Agriculture bears the heaviest interest rate—8.5%—of all business enter- 
prises, and is the least able to stand it for the following reasons: It is estimated 
that every twelve years the value of all farm buildings is absorbed by interest
-P-A-G-E-70
  66 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
charges, that interest charges absorb the value of all live stock every nine years, 
and every two and one-half years the value of all farm implements and 
machinery. So it is manifest that some farm loan system should be worked 
out and adopted by our government. It is estimated that the annual interest 
charges upon all farm indebtedness amount to $510,000,000, while the en- 
tire wheat crop in the United States in 1911 was about $543,000,000. 
DistTRiBuTIoN. 
The small individual shipper or buyer cannot hope for the business con- 
sideration and success that accompany buying and selling on a large scale. 
The farmers should thoroughly organize and have community centers for 
buying and selling and distributing, and have a central marketing bureau 
in close touch with each community, agency or exchange, using the parcel 
post as a medium of exchange and distribution to the large centers of popula- 
tion. Distribution and transportation are inseparable, and transportation 
is dependent on suitable roads—steam, trolley and highways. Kentucky’s 
highway system must be improved before proper distribution can take place, 
in a State-wide sense. Convict labor could be used to advantage in perfecting 
a great system of State highways. 
PRopvuction. 
Owing to our rapidly increasing native population, and including immigra- 
tion, amounting to over 1,000,000 souls a year, and with no new lands in the 
United States for agricultural purposes, to speak of, we are rapidly approach- 
ing a shortage of food supplies for our own people. The United States Bureau 
of Census states that in the past decade the total production of all cereal 
crops, such as corn, wheat, oats, barley, rice, rye, ete., increased by only 
1.7%, that is 4,489,000,000 bushels in 1899, as against 4,513,000,000 
bushels in 1909, whereas the acreage farmed and increased 15.4% during the 
same ten years. The same report shows that our wheat export had decreased 
from 37% to 17% of our total production, and our corn exports have decreased 
from 9% to 3% of our total production. Yet the price of wheat in the same 
ten years has increased 31% and the average price of corn has increased 91% 
during the same decade. The year book of the Agricultural Department 
for 1906 furnishes the acreage yields of wheat and corn for forty years, from 
1866 to 1906. Notwithstanding the vast area of rich virgin soils brought under 
cultivation in the great west and northwest in the past forty years, not- 
withstanding the abandonment of great areas of wornout lands in the east and 
southeast in the same period, and not to mention the improvements in se- 
lected seeds and the implements of cultivation, the average yield per acre of 
the two great grain crops, corn and wheat, has not been maintained. The 
average yield of wheat for the United States increased one bushel per acre, 
while the average yield of corn decreased one and one-half bushels of corn 
per acre, according to the forty-year averages. In the meantime the popu- 
lation of the United States has increased from 38,000,000 in 1870, to about 
90,000,000 in 1910, ov an increase of about 137% in forty years. We have 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
FARMERS’ CONFERENCE 67 
been able to feed this increase in population by having large areas of virgin 
land to cultivate and by decreasing our exportation of foodstuffs. The 
time is in sight of those now living, when this country will cease to produce 
enough stuffs to feed its own population, unless some nation-wide movement 
is at once inaugurated to restore the fertility of the soil, not merely to con- 
serve it. What is the remedy? 
Som, EnricHMEnT. 
The chemists of our agricultural colleges, and particularly Professor Cyril 
G. Hopkins, of Illinois, tell us clearly and plainly that almost all soils, even the 
barren and waste lands, contain enough of the minerai elements, potassium, 
iron, caleium, and magnesium, to grow crops. The other necessary elements 
are obtained through the air and rain, oxygen, hydrogen and carbon—leay- 
ing the two indispensable elements of nitrogen and phosphorous tor soil 
restoration to be supplied by man. The nitrogen and organic matter can be 
restored to the soil by raising clover and leguminous crops containing the 
nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their roots, and green crops that can be ploughed 
under, thus returning and restoring to the soil the organic matter required 
for good crops. It is safe to say that almost all of the soils of this country 
are too acid for the clovers to take hold and flourish. It is demonstrated by 
Professor Hopkins beyond dispute or doubt that if crushed and powdered 
raw lime rock is scattered over the ground, two or three tons to the acre, 
it will sweeten the soil so that abundant clover crops can be raised. Many 
progressive farmers are using the crushed rock, but the class of men who need it 
most are too poor to avail themselves of it. Some plan should be worked out by 
the farmers themselves. They should organize farmers’ co-operative limestone 
crushers, and I would suggest further, that the State buy large mountains 
or quarries of limestone advantageously situated near railways, install modern 
crushers, use convict labor and sell the crushed rock to the farmers at cost 
and interest. The other remaining element, phosphorus, can be obtamed 
only in a commercial or farming sense from the raw phosphate rock. It ap- 
pears advisable therefore that the government have its lands prospected for 
phosphate deposits, a careful survey made of all such territory, and to hold 
them in reserve for our own use, to be sold to the American farmers at cost 
and interest. We are accustomed to the thought of expending billions of 
dollars on the army and navy, as a matter of national defense, but have not 
realized that 86% of all manufactured products come from the farm and the 
soil in a raw state, and that every manufacturer, every merchant, every 
business man, all good citizens are vitally interested in restoring and main- 
taining the soil fertility. It means the life or death of a nation. 
The economic and political adjustment involved in the revision of the 
tariff and the currency reform, while of vast importance to our country, 
is not so far-reaching and of so vital value to our people as a whole as the wise 
and proper solution of this great and many-sided problem we are now facing. 
I feel that we can go at our problem more thoroughly and effectively and with 
greater hope and assurance of arriving at something definitely helpful and 
practical, if we first, in a general way, analyze the changes that have taken  
-P-A-G-E-72
    68 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
place in our national life, and get fixed in our minds a broad understanding 
of the conditions we wish to modify and correct. 
Our subject of “how to organize and build up country life” clearly implies 
that in the minds of the educators who are promoting this Conference, that 
our country life as its exists today is disorganized and instead of being built 
up, is disintegrating, to which every thoughtful and observi megperson must 
give an alarmed concurrence. 
As I interpret the conditions and signs of the times, our national tem- 
perament and character have undergone a radical change, and in order to 
arrive at a successful solution of this problem it is necessary for us to under- 
stand what this mental revolution is on the part of the American people. 
One hundred years ago—a very short period as considered in the life of 
great nations—Philadelphia had a population of 65,000 souls, and was the 
largest city in the United States. New York City came next with 60,000 
inhabitants. These two cities comprised everything in the United States 
that savored of metropolitan life, habit and thought, and they would now 
be considered merely overgrown villages in their raw crudeness and lack of 
modern comforts and conveniences, which every little up+ -to-date town takes 
as a matter of course. The life of these two premier towns of the United 
States was essentially a village life. Then, the household was the manufactur- 
ing establishment. Certain families devoted themselves to shoe making, other 
families to weaving, and others to spinning. Even then, in most instances, 
this work was done within the home itself. Apprentices were taken into the 
family life and in the absence of sons, would succeed the founder of the bus- 
iness and continue the home industry. But. now, all of this is changed, ma- 
chinery has taken the place of hand work, the centralized factory has taken 
the place of the home. Today things are different with us. Around these 
factories, grouped as they have been for economic reasons, homes have grown 
up and, in a word, the city has come and come to stay. The hand of time with 
its swinging change will not move backward in its flight. Today our national 
life, by reason of these changes, is divided into two great classes—the city 
and the country. We are urban and rural. The life in the city is very dif- 
ferent from that in the country. We are different as people. We are different 
in our ideals, our social and religious life. We are different in our work, our 
interests and our amusements. In fact, our whole point of view is different. 
Strangely enough, we are just beginning to realize this fact. We have grown 
so fast that we have not had time to catch our breath and to adjust our- 
selves to the new conditions. But this we are trying to do now. The great 
problem we are facing is the problem of adjustment to the changed environ- 
ment in which we live. 
This change has affected our lives in all their aspects. We used all to be 
country people and had the economic, social and religious point of view of 
the countryman. About sixty per cent. of our people are now living in the 
country, and to all intents and purposes, ought to be country people, but 
in reality they have the point of view of the city man—especially is this 
true of the younger people—the generation coming on. There have been 
many reasons contributing to this point of view on the part of our younger 
people living in the country. Wealth has accumulated in the city to an 
   
-P-A-G-E-73
  
FARMERS’ CONFERENCE 69 
unbelievable extent in the past fifty years. The wealth of the mines, of the 
forests and of the land, has been transmuted by the great captains of industry 
to swell the vast fortunes of the city. We have seen men, beginning from a 
very humble and lowly origin, in a short space attain to position of influence 
and leadership. The city is rich and is growing richer, by reason of the 
very conditions of its existence. Life in all its aspects has been more ef- 
ficient as time goes on. The city man has learned to co-operate with other 
city men. Through this policy of centralization and co-operation the city 
has been able to attract to itself the wealth which is produced in the country 
and for the most part to keep that wealth in the city. There has developed 
what is known as the lure of the city. By the lure of the city we mean all that 
indescribable status of life that makes the city, superficially at least, more 
attractive to the average person than the country. The city has thoroughly 
organized its economic life. Particularly lately, it has been alive to every 
improvement possible. It has taken advantage of every opening to further 
economic efficiency. Today we find the city ready and prepared for the im- 
mediate seizure of every business advantage which presents itself. Busi- 
ness men’s associations are on the lookout for new factories and manufactur- 
ing enterprises of every nature. Well organized lobbies are knocking at the 
doors of our county, state and national legislative bodies, seeking the enact- 
ment of laws which will still further enhance the wealth and safeguard the 
advantages the city already enjoys. 
Because of the superior organization of the city life on its economic side, 
it has been able to make its social life more and more attractive. It has 
realized the great opportunity of appealing to men and women by making 
social life pleasant and attractive. In the saloon, the club, the theatre, the 
moving-picture show, the dance hall, the literary society, the library, and 
countless other agencies the city has provided opportunity for enjoyment of 
the leisure time of both old and young. Great numbers of country people 
go to the city for their amusement. The impression they have of the city 
is formed, to a very large extent, through this social contact with city life, 
and it is all to the advantage of the city. The religious life of the city has 
been made more attractive. The church buildings are more commodious 
and ornate. Facilities for the conduct of the worship and afl other religious 
activities have been abundantly:provided. The ablest men for the pulpits, 
the most pleasing music, have been secured. Everything possible for holding 
the interest of the people in religious life has been done. Educational ad- 
vantages of the very highest type are offered. Splendid buildings for schools, 
the finest possible equipment, the very best character of instruction, have 
all been provided. This is another source of attractiveness. 
This is pre-eminently an age of specialization. The city has been quick 
to seize the opportunities which specialization has presented. It has entered 
into the reward which its wisdom and foresight has assured. The lure of the 
city is a dominating influence in the life of the country today. It seems to 
be tightening its grip. 
The country has been robbed of the product of its mines, it has been 
stripped of the timber of its forests, it has been impoverished in its soil. Today 
the country is poor, indeed. And all of this impoverishment has come, too, 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
    
70 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
in an age when all that science can do has been done to provide the very best 
appliances for the cultivation of the soil and the securing of the best crops. 
But unfortunately for the country, the whole, or practically the whole, em- 
phasis of science has been laid upon the means of getting from the soil and 
not of giving to the soil. One cannot indefinitely withdraw from a bank 
account, without continuing to make deposits to cover the amount of the 
withdrawals. The end is bound to be bankruptcy. And that is the situation 
the country faces today. Constantly increasing withdrawals have left in an 
almost depleted condition the account of the country economically, socially, 
educationally and religiously. And strangely enough it is the country people 
who have made this thing possible. It is they who will have it so. It is not 
the fault of the city at all. City life and country life are in no sense com- 
petitive—they are reciprocal and complementary. All these unfortunate 
conditions I have enumerated rightly lie at the door of the country people. 
Their ideals have been wrong. Their point of view has been wrong. The 
farmer has been affected by the lure of the city. He has looked forward to 
the time when he could retire from the farm and locate in some town or city. 
His aim, frequently, has been to get as much as possible out of the farm, and 
then when he was ready to retire, sell it to the best possible advantage and 
invest his money in some city enterprises. True he has bought the very best 
and latest machinery and other appliances for farming, but he has bought 
them with the purpose of getting from the farm and not for the purpose of 
giving to the farm. He has talked of the time when he could get to the city 
and settle down, to what he thought was a life of ease and enjoyment. His 
sons and daughters have imbibed this spirit from the beginning of their con- 
scious lives, and they, too, have looked forward to the time when their exile 
on the farm was over and they could enter into the joy of the promised land 
ahead. This attitude of mind in matters economic has determined the 
attitude toward all other phases of life. The social life of the country has 
been neglected and has been held up as a thing of contempt. No effort has 
been made to improve it at all. It has been tolerated until the boy or girl 
could get away from it to the life of the city. 
The poorest schools and the poorest and most inadequate buildings are in 
the country. The poorest teaching has been in the country. Some young 
man has taught for a few months or years until he could get enough money 
together to go to college to fit himself for some business or professional 
- position. The country boy has been influenced more by this attitude of mind 
of his teacher than by any other factor in his contact with the teacher. There 
grows up within him a feeling of discontent. He becomes dissatisfied. He 
eagerly awaits the time when he too can get to the city. If he is disappointed 
in reaching this hope, and has to remain in the country, he is ever after a 
disappointed man and has no interest in improving the conditions of ‘country 
life. Frequently the young women who teach country schools have no special 
preparation for their work and look forward either to matrimony or promo- 
tion to a city position. Whatever training they take, in addition to the initial 
training, is frequently with a view toward fitting them for the specialized 
city position. No wonder then, that the girl in the country becomes dissatis- 
fied and looks forward to something other than a life in the country. The
-P-A-G-E-75
  
FARMERS’ CONFERENCE a 
profession of teaching should be invested with the highest honor and dignity 
in the minds of the American people, and should receive compensation com- 
mensurate with its national value and importance. 
In order to grapple with this many-sided and perplexing problem, it is 
essential that we approach it with a broad and definite vision. That we may 
have something concrete to consider, I beg to make these suggestions: 
1. By legislative enactment, elementary agriculture should be required 
to be taught in every rurat school and the public schools ot the smaller towns 
in the State. 
2. To that end schools or courses of special instruction should be arranged 
at the agricultural colleges for the education of the rural teachers, and they 
should be required by law to qualify themselves in elementary agriculture, 
seed testing, etc., domestic science, hygiene, and sanitation, and rural soci- 
ology and economics. 
It is my belief that for rural life betterment the open country must undergo 
a regeneration socially, educationally and industrially. This demands the 
most earnest efforts of the best minds in America. All permanent better- 
ment must of necessity be the resultant of the highest and best residential 
forces working together. Extraneous forces may stimulate and direct but 
they cannot lastingly sustain rural life. I know of no better method than the 
Community Welfare and Progress Association as now being organized by the 
Eastern Kentucky State Normal School. In this connection, on rural develop- 
ment centers, its able and earnest president, Dr. Crabbe, said: 
“Tn these organizations it is hoped that the school can be helped to measure 
up to its responsibilities. Some of the plans are, to map a planting plan for 
the school grounds, make out a plan for interior decoration, show the ad- 
vantages of directed play, give the fundamentals of agriculture, fruit growing, 
household science, sanitation and hygiene, rural training, etc. It does not 
stop here, but goes into the home, anywhere to be of assistance. The farmer 
will be aided in problems of crop rotation, seed selection, variety values, 
fertilizer requirements, breeding problems. The housewife will be interested 
in decoration, cooking, sewing, serving, canning, clean milk, care of children, 
pure water. It will be a rural organization by rural folk for the betterment of 
the rural community. It will be for the young people as well as for the grown- 
up. It is a great movement and we are going to push it to the limit. We 
hope during the next year to extend it to every county in the eastern district.” 
All of this looks eventually to the consolidated graded country school. 
Rational recreation and amusement are essential to stop the drift of the young 
people from the farm to the cities. The consolidated graded country school 
should have one big room, which in addition to being a school or classroom, 
can be used as an auditorium where receptions, concerts and other entertain- 
ments can be given. 
Organized effort should be made to establish musical, literary and other 
useful societies, and to bring them within this sphere. 
A well-known authority on rural economics states: ‘The farmer has the 
most scientific job in America. While the average factory makes use of one 
or two sciences, the average farmer makes important use of half a dozen or 
more. The farmer must make, save or lose money by the degree of skill with  
-P-A-G-E-76
  12 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
which he applies the science of animal nutrition, animal hygiene, soil chemistry, 
soil physics, plant nutrition, plant hygiene, to say nothing of curing, housing 
and preparing his product. Besides he must be a gardener, a poultryman, 
a fruit-grower. The conclusion is the job is too big for one man unaided.” 
So, all present activities for thus educating the producer deserve mainten- 
ance and encouragement. There should be an agricultural expert in each 
county, to advise in soil analysis and restoration, cropping systems, seed 
testing and selection, and farm management problems, and to establish dem- 
onstrating centers. These soil experts should be further qualified and able 
to be advisers and assist in directing distributional activities for their counties, 
manage labor bureaus, organize club work, and centralize and simplify the 
entire system. There should be a systematic co-ordination and federation 
of all the forces and agencies that are capable of bettering farm life. In 
Woodford county, we have the Y. M. C. A. extension work, which co-operates 
with and supplements the splendid service of the county demonstrator and 
the farmers’ union. It is known as the Woodford County Agricultural As- 
sociation. 
We realize that the strength and power and life of a nation depend upon 
the family as a unit. It is essential that the children should have strong 
home love and their affections entwined in happy home surroundings. The 
child who does not love home cannot be expected to have a love for the 
town, county, State or nation. Good homes make good citizens and a strong 
nation. The country boy or girl moves to the city mainly for two reasons— 
to make money and to have a more comfortable and a “better time.” 
In order to stop this, rural social conditions must be improved and made 
as attractive as city life, and farm wealth must be increased through the 
channels of productiveness and better facilities for distribution. 
This restlessness. and discontent is one of the greatest problems we must 
face. Unless we change it no one can tell what the end shall be. 
    FARMERS’ CLUBS. 
A. D. Wilson, Director of Agricultural Extension and Farmers’ Institutes, 
University of Minnesota. 
We believe in the farmers’ club because it develops people. It tends to 
bring out the best there is in a community, and to get people ready to act 
concertedly for their own betterment. It is an ever-ready means of taking 
up and studying independently any matter of importance to the community. 
It makes the work of the unscrupulous promoter unprofitable and aids any 
movement that is for the real interest of the community. It makes any new 
movement undertaken the work of all of the people, rather than something 
to be forced on them by someone from the outside. A farmers’ club is needed 
in every community. 
What a Farmers’ Club Is—A farmers’ club is an organization of the people 
of any community for the improvement of themselves, their homes, and their
-P-A-G-E-77
        73 
  FARMERS’ CONFERENCE 
community. It should include in its membership the whole family, men, 
women and children. Two or more families may constitute a successful 
farmers’ club, but it is best, where possible, to include all the people in the 
community. A rural school district is a suitable territory to be covered by a 
farmers’ club. Meetings are held in the homes of the members, in town halls, 
or schoolhouses. There are many advantages in having the meetings at the 
homes of the members wherever it is practical to do so. The territory should 
be small enough so that all of its members can conveniently get together. 
Co-operation or Peasantry—There seems to be but two solutions to the 
problem of putting the farmer on an equal basis with those with whom he 
has business outside of the farm. One is to increase the size of the average 
farm; the other is to unite the interests of several farmers owning farms of 
ordinary size for purposes of outside contact, in both buying and selling. 
The latter plan is decidedly preferable, because it does not involve the land- 
lord and tenant or landlord and hired-help system, and makes possible the 
maintenance of the family-sized farm, which is probably one of our most 
important American institutions. Co-operation will help to make possible 
the maintenance of the family-sized farm, operated by its owner, longer than 
it can be maintained in any other way. 
Economy in Co-operation—Co-operation in marketing and in buying is, 
we believe, essential to the economical distribution of products. Large quan- 
tities of uniformly good products can be sold much more advantageously 
than can smaller quantities of products, each sample of which may be good 
in itself, but which, when brought together, are not uniform. When every 
farm was manufacturing its own butter, and each of the hundred or more 
farmers in the community was trying to sell butter of a different quality, 
the price of butter was comparatively low. Where butter is manufactured 
in one plant, the manager of the creamery has at his disposal large quantities 
of a uniform product and can sell it at the best possible price. 
If the products of a community, such as grain, potatoes, live stock, can 
be made uniform by co-operation among the members of the community in 
production, and then these larger quantities of uniform products can be sold 
by one man, the same advantages that come to the large farmer, or have come 
to the dairy industry, can be secured in other enterprises on the farm. 
Club Promotes Co-operation—A farmers’ club is the logical forerunner of 
co-operation. In the first place, it gets the people of a community acquainted 
and increases the confidence of each in the other. This is absolutely essential 
to successful co-operation. In the second place, it provides a logical means 
for studying carefully any enterprise that it is proposed to undertake co-oper- 
atively, so that impractical undertakings are likely to be avoided. We believe 
that the farmers’ club is a vital factor in promoting co-operation for efficiency, 
because it is not organized to defeat any particular class of people, but to 
study intelligently any problem that may come up, and to take the action 
necessary to put any plan decided upon into effective operation. 
How to Organize a Club—The organization of a club is not complicated 
or difficult. A good way to start the movement is for someone in a com- 
munity who is interested, to invite two or more of this neighbors to meet 
at his home or some other suitable place. If an interesting program, includ- 
     
   
-P-A-G-E-78
  74 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
ing singing and speaking by young people can be arranged, so much the better. 
A dinner or supper should be provided, as eating together does more than 
any other one thing to break down reserve, formality and distrust. It is 
much easier to carry out a movement of this kind after a good meal has been 
served. The proposition should be talked over, and it is well if a considerable 
portion of those present have discussed the matter beforehand, in private 
conversation. No one need have any fear of joining the club, because there 
is no stock sold and no possibility of loss. It is simply a mutual understanding 
that the people inthe community will take up collectively questions of 
interest to the community, instead of struggling with them individually. 
Meetings—Meetings should be held once or twice a month during the winter 
and as frequently as possible during the summer. Meetings in the homes of 
the members have at least two advantages: (1) attendance is stimulated by 
the feeling of obligation to the host and hostess, and (2) the knowledge that 
the club is soon to meet on a given farm or in its home is a great stimulus 
to house-cleaning and decoration and corresponding outdoor activities. 
Co-operative Effort Fostered—Some of the following undertakings may well 
be fostered by the farmers’ club. The producers in a community should 
decide upon one variety of potato or other market crop to produce, and then 
find some way of marketing it jointly. One or two leading breeds of each 
kind of live stock should be adopted by the club. Pure-bred sires may be 
purchased and used co-operatively, to the advantage of everyone. Feed, 
flour, cement and other supplies that can be handled in large lots, may be 
purchased co-operatively, usually at a considerable saving. 
The question of organizing a live-stock shipping association is worth 
considering where live stock is an important factor. Home conveniences, 
and beef for supplying fresh meat should be considered. When dairying is 
important, the organization of a cow-testing association is valuable. In any 
neighborhood, community effort along the line of road improvement is worth 
very careful consideration. Such matters as organizing a creamery, cheese 
factory, or farmer’s elevator, the purchase of a stallion, or the introduction of 
a general drainage system for the community, should be considered by the 
club and acted upon only after all the facts in the case are known. One of 
the latest attempts of a farmers’ club is to organize a co-operative laundry 
in connection with a co-operative creamery. In short, every enterprise con- 
nected with the farms, homes, or schools may be profitably considered by 
the club. 
HOW TO ORGANIZE AND CONDUCT A FARMERS’ CLUB. 
T. F. Peck, State Commissioner of Agriculture, Nashville, Tenn. 
In Tennessee we are very much interested in the farmer, and eager for him 
to produce more. We hear a great deal about the high cost of living, and many 
believe that increased production alone will solve the problem, many others 
believe that a revision of our marketing will solve it. Still others are urging 
the “back to the farm” movement as a solution; others say, you cannot change 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
FARMERS’ CONFERENCE Ui 
the methods of the farmers of today, but must educate the rising generations 
in agriculture. We have our experiment stations, our college of agriculture, 
our demonstration agents, etc., and the backward farmer is inclined to go 
on in the footsteps of his father, saying that there are too many kinds of this 
new-fangled farming for him; that they tell him too many different ways; 
that it takes more money than he has to carry out their suggestions. 
We know that the original research work is invaluable. We know that we 
must have men trained for advanced work in agriculture. We know that the 
demonstration agents and the boys’ corn clubs have worked wonders; and we 
would not minimize, but rather enlarge all those forces. But, gentlemen, 
there is a work that can be done that will serve as the foundation, the work- 
ing base for all the other forces and make their work more effective. That 
work is establishing community co-operation; making the community the 
unit, and blending those units into county agricultural associations. 
Now, the question is, how can this best be accomplished? I will outline to 
you, briefly, how the Tennessee Department of Agriculture has undertaken 
the work. 
We have three grand divisions of the State; east, middle and west Tennessee. 
We have an assistant commissioner of agriculture for each division. These 
gentlemen have undertaken this specific work in their respective divisions. 
The hard problem is to get down to the community. Our ideas are inclined 
to get too big on the start. We do not feel like we are accomplishing much 
if we fail to have large audiences, an elaborate program, and things go with 
a flourish. But if we succeed in establishing community co-operation of a 
sound practical basis, we have simply got to make up our minds to community 
work. What I mean by community work is to select a community; locate its 
boundaries, get the name and address of every farmer in that community; 
see enough of them and outline to them the advantages of the movement to 
the community, by working as a unit on all of their problems; show them how 
it will affect them in production, and sale of live stock, of farm crops, dairy 
products, fruits and vegetables; get enough of them enthused to interest the 
remaining farmers in the community sufficiently to get them all together at 
the schoolhouse, and then make clear to them the advantages; show them how, 
as a community, they can be their own distributors; so that instead of only 
forty cents out of the dollar paid by the consumer going to the farmer for his 
products and sixty cents to the distributor, that, by grafting on to the produc- 
tion end of their business a portion of the distribution, they should get at least 
fifty per cent. more for their products and save the consumer money. Show 
them that by producing quality and quantity, they can supply dealers in the 
city that are now having to have their farm products shipped in, because, 
as they will tell you, they have to do so to get the quality and quantity 
required by their trade. 
We cannot work up an interest and perfect an organization and leave them 
to work alone, but must keep in touch with them, keep up the interest, get 
them safely on their feet and getting results. If we can get as many as two 
live community organizations in each county in Tennessee in a year, we will 
have done the State a great service, because with such a leaven, it will not 
take long to get cohesion and co-operation in every community in Tennessee;
-P-A-G-E-80
  76 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
then our other forces will find the farmers, heretofore either indifferent or 
antagonistic, eager and anxious to take up with their suggestions. Then 
agriculture in the elementary schools will be a live subject, the high schools 
without provisions for agriculture, both theoretical and practical demon- 
stration, will have to wake up. Then, too, our college of agriculture will have 
more boys striving to enter its doors, then the agricultural course will be the 
most popular. 
In the organization of the community club, do not overlook the women and 
girls, because they will readily grasp its possibilities for them. They make 
the home attractive or otherwise, according to their opportunities, give them 
encouragement and a fair chance, and they will make their homes really 
homelike and inviting, that the men and boys will be more content to remain 
in them. Give the farm women a chance to make their homes what they 
desire, and they will do much towards solving the problem of keeping the boys 
and girls permanently on the farm. * 
If we would improve agricultural conditions, lets begin with the first essen- 
tial; practical and profitable community co-operation; then the other forces 
can plant their séeds of agricultural knowledge in ground that is fertile and 
will produce results. We can solve the question of community co-operation 
if we can get down to individual work in the community, in perfecting the 
organization. 
In Tennessee, the Department of Agriculture will have the co-operation 
of some of the railroads now in this work, and later, more of them will come 
in. The railroads have manifested a keen practical interest in agricultural 
development, and have rendered the department great service in the work 
we have been doing. I am sure when this question of community co-opera- 
tion is intelligently presented to them with a feasible plan for accomplish- 
ing it, they will readily co-operate in the work along their several lines. 
They want increased tonnage; they want prosperous patrons along their lines; 
they will readily see the good results that will follow common-sense com- 
munity co-operation. 
Now as for the organization, make it simple and practical. The community 
should select one of their number as a presiding officer and another as vice- 
president, to serve in the absence of the president. The farmer in the commun- 
ity who has had some successful business training, should be selected as 
secretary, because he should not only keep a record of the meetings, but should 
keep in touch with the markets. As a club, they should have some good farm, 
live stock and market journals, and at their weekly meetings, discuss crops 
and markets and marketing. Meet once a week, make the club a social center. 
The community will be better, if the farmers and their families get together 
once a week in a social and business way. When the people of any community 
realize that their interests, their prosperity and happiness is more dependent 
upon that community in which they live, than all other communities in the 
world together, they will take a greater interest in matters that will make that 
community better. 
We have before us a great work—one that should have received attention
-P-A-G-E-81
         FARMERS’ CONFERENCE 77 
long ago, but one that we can accomplish if we are willing to begin in a small 
way and do first individual work, remembering, that “Great Oaks from Little 
Acorns Grow.” 
CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR SUCCESSFUL CO-OPERATIVE 
MARKETING BY FARMERS. 
T. J. Brooks, Chair of Markets and Rural Economics, A. and M. College, 
Mississippi. 
The subject which I have for discussion is, ‘“Conditions Necessary for Sue- 
cessful Co-operative Marketing by Farmers.” I would give as a first requisite 
for a favorable condition, availability of market. This includes the location 
of a community, its nearness to the railroad station, and the distance of the 
railroad station from the markets which must be sought to dispose of the 
articles produced. One would not want to undertake a co-operative market- 
ing business where conditions make it impossible to have a volume of business 
sufficient to make it self-sustaining. Our last census report makes it possible 
to ascertain the amount of live stock that is marketed in any census district 
in the United States. This could be taken for a basis for calculating the 
volume of business that may be expected from any given point. Availability 
of market also includes the character of stuff to be marketed. Some things 
must be disposed of in the local market; some things in a relatively near 
market; other things may be shipped to any point at any distance. Out 
modern system of transportation is developed in most sections to where 
almost anything can be shipped a hundred miles or so. Even the most 
perishable products can be put in refrigerators and shipped across the con- 
tinent. But the main thing to be considered in organizing a local co-operative 
association is an absolute certainty of a sufficient volume of business to defray 
the expenses of the association at a very low percentage of charges. 
The second requisite for a successful co-operative marketing society is a 
proper understanding of what it takes to constitute a co-operative society. 
There are two general ways of transacting business; first, the individualistic 
way; second, the collective way. Of course the individualistic way is where 
one person attends to his own affairs without regard to anyone else. This 
has been the policy of the farmer and a need for a change in his business is 
indicated by his failure to keep step with the march of progress in the commer- 
cial world. The second, or collective way, may be divided into corporate and 
non-corporate methods. The non-corporate method is the partnership method 
where two or more men go together and form a partnership and carry on any 
kind of a business. This kind of combination renders each member of the 
firm responsible to the full extent of his property for all the debts incurred 
by the firm; this method has almost gone out of use and is seldom practiced. 
The other collective method is the corporate method. When a corporation is 
organized, the stockholders are responsible only to the amount of the shares 
prescribed. Now either of these can be operated on co-operative principles,
-P-A-G-E-82
    
        
   
                                                                                                  
      
                78 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
but I would advise the taking out of a charter where there is need of any 
amount of capital stock to carry on the business. 
Let us analyze the difference between the three corporation methods of 
business. First, the joint stock company method is where a corporation is 
organized, controlled and operated by stockholders, exclusively for the benefit 
of stockholders; no one else is considered in the distribution of profits. Second, 
the co-partnership, or profit-sharing corporation, goes one step farther and 
includes among those who receive a part of the profits the employees of the 
concern. This is exemplified in the case of the Ford Automobile Company. 
Each employee gets a percentage of the profits, based upon his salary. This 
method is on the increase, but as yet most of our corporations are conducted 
according to the first method. 
The third method of conducting a business is the co-operative method. 
There are just three essential factors in conducting any business: first, the 
stockholders; second, the employees; third, the customers. The co-operative 
company takes all of these into consideration and treats them as equally 
important factors in the successful operation of its business. The stockholders 
are limited in their earnings to a certain per cent. on the capital invested, 
the remainder of the profits is divided between a sinking fund, the employees, 
and the customers; so that when dividends are declared at the end ot the year, 
the customer receives back all the charges collected from him, less the unavoid- 
able cost of transacting the business. For this reason it is not as attractive 
to the investor as.the joint stock company; the profits being limited to the 
stockholders, just as profits are limited to the owner of a bond. But it does 
appeal to the customer, because he is assured of all the profits being returned 
to him except the unavoidable expense of conducting business. 
I would say that the third requisite for carrying on co-operative business 
is a proper attitude of mind on the part of the people of a community. You 
cannot succeed in a co-operative business with people who do not endorse it, 
who do not believe in it, who do not believe it is based upon equity and justice; 
and they must understand it before they can pass judgment as to whether 
they endorse it or not. 
The fourth requisite is constant supply. We not only must have a supply 
of sufficient amount to justify the business, but it must be a constant supply 
in order to give the best results. This is made necessary because the customer 
or the purchaser wants to know what he can depend upon in making contracts 
for any special grade of products which may be handled. 
The fifth requisite for this kind of business is standardization of the products 
which are to be handled. This is absolutely essential, without it there can 
be no successful co-operative shipping or selling association; without it you 
cannot build up a regular trade; without it you cannot compete with others 
who do standardize. It was standardization that made those Danish farmers 
so successful in their co-operative selling, that has become of world-wide 
notoriety. People of every country have beaten a path to the door of little 
Denmark to learn the way in which they arose from abject poverty to pros- 
perity. And the whole story is told in one sentence, they standardized their 
farm products and sold collectively to the markets of the world. 
The sixth condition that I would name seems paradoxical upon the face
-P-A-G-E-83
  
FARMERS’ CONFERENCE 79 
of it. It would appear that a prosperous community where everybody could 
finance himself would be the ideal place to start a co-operative movement, 
but the history of co-operation proves the opposite. It usually starts where 
the farmers become desperate because of their poverty, and are willing to 
submerge the identity of each into a collective group to act as a unit. This 
was the case in Denmark, it was the case in every instance where the initiative 
was taken up by the farmers themselves. However, after they have proved 
it to be a success, prosperous communities adopt it and utilize its methods. 
I would designate as the seventh requisite, legalized loyalty. I mean by 
this that each member of a co-operative association must sign a contract 
that he will deliver his output to the association. This contract must be 
protected by the laws of the State. This will be the stumbling stone in most 
communities hard to overcome, as most farmers will be unwilling to sign an 
agreement of that kind; but I say to you here and now that it is the only safe 
way. So many tricks can be worked by the outsider to decoy members away 
from a co-operative association that unless you have this binding contract 
you are liable to be destroyed. These contracts, I find, are enforced wherever 
successful co-operation has been achieved. It is so in Germany, it is so in 
France, it is so in Denmark, it is so in Ireland, it is so in the United States. 
Perhaps the most successful and largest co-operative association of farmers in 
the United States, is the California Fruit Growers’: Exchange, its success 
is based upon these contracts. The California Walnut Growers’ Association 
comes nearer being a farmers’ trust than anything we have in this country, 
and it has been a splendid success, and that success is based upon a strong 
binding contract that a member must patronize his association. The same is 
true of the Hood River Apple Growers’ Association. The same is true of the 
Georgia Fruit Growers’ Exchange. The same is true of the East Shore of 
Virginia Produce Exchange, where the organized farmers in two counties 
are annually handling $4,000,000 worth of produce co-operatively. The same 
is true of the co-operative grain elevators, and I attribute the failure of 
numerous efforts at handling cotton to the fact that such contracts have never 
been required of the members. z 
One other very essential factor of success is the right kind of leadership. 
Unless you have a leader in your local organization who has the confidence of 
the members, who has business sense, and who knows how to manage folks, 
the association is apt to come to grief. This man must be a general, a diplomat, 
a business genius, with the patience of Job and the endurance of a saint, and 
he must be able to stem the tide of petty bickering which he is almost sure 
to meet; and here is where most organizations fail—to get a good leader. 
If you are looking for an easy place with good pay you will not find it as leader 
of a co-operative society of this kind, for they have many unpleasant things 
to deal with, and small pay until they make it such a success that all opposi- 
tion ceases. One other thing I think necessary in some sections, is legislation, 
for we have no provision in some States for a co-operative business. All 
co-operative concerns have two essential factors which differ from any other 
kind of business, namely: one man, one vote, regardless of the number of 
shares he owns; and distribution of profits back to the customer or members of. 
the association. The laws must protect this kind of an organization and in 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  80 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
some States it will be necessary to have special legislation governing this 
specific kind of business. 
I might go on and name other minor details, or explain some of these to 
cover more details, but I have said enough to indicate the peculiar conditions 
which must be considered in undertaking to start a co-operative business, 
it matters not whether that business is shipping farm products, buying farm 
requirements, or doing any kind of manufacturing. The fact that these 
shipping associations have made a success while running in competition with 
the strongest and best organized joint stock companies, proves that it is a 
sound economic theory and it only requires proper management, when the 
conditions are favorable, to successfully operate a farmers’ co-operative selling 
association. 
ESSENTIALS FOR A MARKETING ORGANIZATION. 
C. E. Bassett, Office of Markets, U. S. Department of Agriculture. 
Having listened to a review of the principles that should be woven into a 
co-operative marketing association, your attention is now requested to some 
of the forms of organizations by which these principles may become an active 
force. 
Objects—The objects of such an association might be to encourage better 
and more economical methods of production and distribution; to secure better 
results in grading, packing, marketing, standardizing and advertising farm 
products; to buy supplies in a co-operative way; to rent, buy, build, own, sell 
and control such buildings and other real and personal property as may be 
needed in the business; to cultivate the co-operative spirit in the community 
and to perform any other work which may tend to the betterment of the mem- 
bers and the uplift of the neighborhood. Make the objects as definite as 
possible, but it is also well to include a “blanket,” which will cover any future 
efforts of the association. 
Membership—While any bona fide grower of farm products, in the territory 
tributary to the shipping points of the association, who shall sign the rules, 
might become a member of this association by purchasing one share of capital 
stock or other regular investment, there may be conditions where it would 
be wise to limit membership to those who have been recommended by the 
directors, or who have received a two-thirds vote of the members present 
at any meeting. It is doubtful if ‘chronic kickers’ should ever be admitted. 
The admission of merchants, bankers, ete., may not be harmful, but the man- 
agement should at all times be controlled by the producers. 
Meetings—The annual meeting should be held as soon after the close of 
the year’s main business, as will allow for the settlement of all accounts, audit- 
ing the books and the preparation of the annual reports of the officers. 
Officers—At each annual meeting a board of seven (7) directors should 
be elected. A president, vice-president and secretary-treasurer might be 
chosen by the directors from among themselves at the first board meeting 
after the annual meeting. They should also choose two auditors, who shall
-P-A-G-E-85
  FARMERS’ CONFERENCE 81 
not be members of the board. All officers should be elected by ballot and 
should perform the usual work of such officers. The board should employ 
a business manager, who shall have charge of the business of the associa- 
tion, under the direction of the board, who shall fix his compensation. In 
a large organization it would be well to unite the office manager, secretary 
and treasurer in one person, as frequent audits and counter signature of 
checks, vouchers, etc., would serve as a sufficient check. The combining of 
these duties in one individual centers all the office work and tends to greater 
efficiency. 
Bonding—All officers, who may handle any of the funds or other property 
of the association, should give a surety bond in excess of the funds which they 
are liable to handle at any one time. The cost of such bonds may be paid for 
by the association. 
Capital Stock—The capital stock of the association might be $5,000 divided 
into 1,000 shares of $5.00 each. No member should hold more than ten per 
cent. of the outstanding stock of the association. Transfers of shares should 
only be made upon the books of the association when the stockholder is clear 
from all indebtedness to the association.. A stockholder, desiring to dis- 
pose of his shares, should first offer them to the association, through the 
board of directors, at market value. This last provision, if desired, must 
be provided for in the articles of incorporation, to make it legal. To allow 
outsiders to purchase association stock might transfer the control of the 
organization to those who are opposed to its continuance. 
Financing—In case the business of an association is such as to only require 
a small amount of money and that only for a short time during each year, 
it may not be necessary to have any capital stock. Annual dues may be 
collected. The following plan has in such cases worked well, where the local 
banks are prepared and willing to make such loans. Where this plan is 
adopted the following would take the place of the preceding method: 
At the time of uniting with the association and at the end of each three 
years after the incorporation of the association, each member gives a promis- 
sory note, payable on demand to the association. This note shall be for the 
sum of twenty-five ($25.00) dollars, and an additional one ($1.00) dollar for 
each and every acre of crops, to be marketed through the association, then 
owned by the member. But in no case shall this note be for a less sum than 
thirty-five ($35.00) dollars. When a new note is given, the old one shall be 
eanceled and returned to the maker. 
These notes shall be the property of the association and shall be used by the 
directors as collateral security with which to borrow needed money for the 
association’s business. Whenever these notes are deposited as security for 
a loan, each of the members shall individually share the liability in propor-- 
tion to the face value of his respective note. 
Each member shall pay an annual membership fee of $2.00, payable Jan- 
uary 1. 
Grading and Inspecting—All goods produced for sale by the members shall 
be delivered to the association as directed by the manager, in prime condi- 
tion for grading, packing and shipping. All grading and packing done on the 
grower’s premises must be in accordance with the rules of the association,  
-P-A-G-E-86
  82 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
and subject to such inspection as may be established by the directors. All 
produce for shipment shail be inspected before shipment, and if any produce 
is not of good quality and in good condition for shipping, such produce shall 
be sorted or otherwise prepared for shipment, at the expense of the party 
to whom such produce belongs. 
All brands, labels, trade-marks, etc., shall be registered and become the 
property of the association and they shall be attached only to such grades 
as shall be ordered by the board of directors. 
Duties and Rights of Members—A member should have the right to give 
away or retain for his own use such of his farm products as he may wish, 
but he should not make sale of crops, promised to the association, to any 
outside parties, except any product not accepted by the association. 
Outside Interference—In case any member is offered a price in excess of the 
price then obtainable by the association, said member should turn said bid 
over to the association for filling from said member’s goods, Some such 
provision is necessary, to prevent an outside disgruntled dealer from making 
a false bid, to test a member’s loyalty and arouse dissension, with the idea 
of disrupting the organization. Allowing the organization to handle this 
bid compels the bidder to ‘“‘pay up or back down;” the grower gets the boosted 
price, if the bidder does not back down, and the organization handles the 
deal and so is strengthened rather than injured. One or two such experiences 
has usually discouraged this very common form of outside interference. 
Each member should have a number or mark, which shall be permanently 
stamped on every sack, box, barrel, crate, basket, or other package shipped 
by him through the association. Any loss occasioned by improper packing 
or grading should be charged to the member whose mark is found on said 
package. 
Products packed on the grower’s premises should be inspected as they are 
being packed, by an association inspector. He may be employed and paid 
by the grower to assist in packing, but he must be held accountable alone 
to the association for his inspection work. His own private mark should 
be placed upon each package he packed or inspected'and he should be held 
jointly responsible with the grower for the pack, as it may be disclosed in - 
the final market, ordinary deterioration excepted. 
Voting—Each member of the association should have one vote and only 
one; providing all claims and dues against said member have been fully 
paid. No proxies should be allowed. In some of the largest non-profit 
co-operative associations, like the California citrus fruit growers, it has been 
felt that it was neither fair nor wise to demand that the large producing 
member should be held to the same vote as a small producing member, when 
their responsibility and liability are so unequal. In such a case the voting 
power of members can be made proportional to the amount of their products 
or acreage handled through the association. 
Minimum Price—It may be well to arrange so that any member might 
have the right to fix a minimum price on his goods, below which they must 
not be sold. Said minimum price should be subject to change by the grower 
later, in case sales cannot be effected at first price set. This plan is in use in 
some western organizations, to protect timid members from being sold out
-P-A-G-E-87
  
FARMERS’ CONFERENCE 83 
by an incompetent or dishonest salesman. The minimum price is named 
by the grower some time in advance of the time of marketing. If the market 
should develop much weaker than it was anticipated, the grower could then 
drop his minimum price to meet the market. In case the grower can find a 
better price than the manager, the association will be protected by the clause 
headed “Outside Interference.” 
Withdrawal—The right of any member to withdraw from the association 
should be understood, but all claims of whatsoever nature must first be 
settled. The time of withdrawal should be fixed so as to take effect after the 
close of a season’s business and before another season begins. To permit a 
member to withdraw during a busy marketing season will result in confusion 
and may seriously handicap the manager in filling his contracts. 
Before the law is resorted to, arbitration should be given a chance to 
settle any difficulty. It is cheaper and prevents discord. 
Duties and Powers of the Manager—The manager should employ and dis- 
charge all labor; he should secure information as to crop and market condi- 
tions and furnish same to the members on request. He should encourage 
the production of the best varieties of products demanded by the trade. He 
should conduct packing schools, in order that growers may become trained 
in the best methods of grading, packing and labeling their products. He 
should have charge of the grading, packing and inspection of all association 
products, and should have control of the brands and labels and their use on the 
association packages, in accordance with the rules of the association. He 
should enter into contracts for the sale of the association goods. He should 
have entire charge of the marketing ot all association goods, subject only 
to the action of the board of directors and the by-laws and rules of the associa- 
tion. The manager is the most important officer and his powers must be 
limited as little as possible. He cannot be held responsible, if he is to be 
dictated to at will by each member or the officers are to constantly 
meddle with his work. This does not imply that the manager should be a 
dictator. He takes the suggestions of the officers and members, and, from 
those of his own experience, he constructs a business plan. Whenever a 
manager loses the confidence of the members, he had best be replaced with a 
manager who possesses that confidence. 
Expenses and Payments—The expenses of operating the association may be 
met by a percentage on returns for produce sold by the association or by a 
fixed price per package, the amount of such charge to be fixed by the directors. 
All merchandise purchased by the association for the use of its members 
should be paid for in cash by each member on delivery, for any system of 
extending credit requires large capital and often results in considerable loss. 
Payment for produce should be made to the shippers on the receipt by the 
association of returns for the sale of their produce, unless otherwise ordered 
by the full board of directors. In making sales all produce of the same grade 
might be pooled for the same day or week and all shippers of the same grade 
would then receive exactly the same price. 
Dividends and Damages—After the season’s expenses are paid and the 
proper sum set aside as a reserve for the depreciation of the association 
property, the balance of the season’s profits should be divided as follows:  
-P-A-G-E-88
  84 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
1. The stockholders might receive the legal rate of interest on the par 
value of their stock. 
2. One-half of the balance may be set aside as a surplus fund, to increase 
‘the working capital or to finance future improvements, until this surplus 
shall be equal the capital stock or, if the members so decide, it'may be made 
greater. 
3. The balance might be divided among the members, in proportion to the 
value of their shipments and purchases made through the association during 
that season. But there should be some provision that when any member 
has failed during that season to live up to his agreements, by failing to ship 
exclusively through the association, or by any other breach of his contract, 
and provided further that said failure on his part has resulted in a loss or 
damage to the association, then said defaulting member shall forfeit to the 
association such a sum as shall reimburse said association for the loss or 
damage thus sustained, in lieu of liquidated damages. Some courts have 
held that to require a member to pay his association a fee for the privilege 
of selling contracted products to an outside dealer is in restraint of trade, 
therefore, illegal. While it may not be legal for an association to penalize 
its members, it may be found that an association can legally provide, as in 
this last plan, to collect damages from a defaulting member, when losses or 
damages have actually resulted from the failure of the member to live up to 
his agreements. Some form of binding contract is essential to hold the 
members of an association together. Many an organization has failed be- 
cause members were only bound by a gentleman’s agreement. A voluntary 
membership is totally inadequate for a stable and long-enduring organiza- 
tion. The laws of the State should be studied, so that this by-law for holding 
members may be legally drawn. 
Auditing—The books and business of the association should be audited 
frequently by the auditors selected from the membership. An annual audit 
should be made by a qualified accountant previous to the date of the annual 
meeting, at which meeting said report should be presented in full. Special 
audits should be made upon order of the board or upon a vote of the members 
at any legally called meeting. While small associations may not feel the 
need of such a strict system of investigating the accounts, it will pay to have 
this work done often and most thoroughly. If the association business 
is being done carelessly, frequent audits will make it known and better 
methods may be adopted before any great loss occurs. The cost of an expert 
accountant is more than balanced by the confidence which it gives the members 
and effectually stopping the criticism of fault-finders. 
Many of these provisions will, no doubt, seem unnecessary and extreme 
to the average producer, who desires to associate his neighbors in a co-operative 
business plan. But that section, which does not feel the absolute need of 
such an association strong enough to be willing to sign a business-like con- 
tract that has some binding effect, had best keep out of such an enterprise. 
The country is full of the wrecks of co-operative associations, that were 
founded on “‘gentlemen’s agreements.” A business: plan that does not bind 
the subscribing parties to some definite line of procedure is no “‘plan’’ at all, 
and certainly lacks the first principle of “business.”

  FARMERS’ CONFERENCE 85 
SOME PROBLEMS AND FACTORS IN FARM ORGANIZATION. 
J. H. Arnold, U. S. Department of Agriculture. 
Farm Management attempts to explain the organization of farms. Farms 
are studied to find out what the farm really is, what its significance is in re- 
lation to other organized industrial units and to find out the different types 
of farms and why they are different. 
In using the term “organization,” we have in mind the size of the farm, 
farm equipment, capital, labor, power, and the various crop and stock enter- 
prises from which an income is received. The farm manager’s primary 
and most important problem in choosing and organizing a farm is to de- 
termine the size of area, the number of enterprises, and the kind of each. 
Shall his main income be from crops raised directly from the soil, or shall 
all or a part of them be fed to stock of certain kinds and the income be de- 
rived from this stock which is fed? 
Now in making this choice he must consider his location, for after all 
the great determining factors in his problems are those involved in soil, 
climate, economic and social conditions. To some extent these may be 
controlled directly or indirectly, but they determine advantages or disad- 
vantages in yield, cost of production, and possibilities of marketing. The 
climate determines the rainfall, temperature, growing season, and avail- 
able days for doing field work. These may be measured for each locality, 
for the data relative to these factors have been pretty well ascertained by 
the U. S. Weather Bureau. The soil has a limited capacity to produce crops 
or stock at a profit. The distances from market and the organization of 
market facilities are factors that help to determine the choice of enterprises. 
In Georgia, a man may put in 250 days out of the 365 in field work; 
in Tennessee about 200; in central Ohio about 160; in central Minnesota 
and the Dakotas about 130. Available time is limited in a similar manner 
by altitude. The higher a farm is located above sea level, the shorter will 
be the season for outdoor work. In Georgia and Tennessee two crops may 
be grown on the same acre of ground in the same year. This is seldom pos- 
sible in Ohio and States north. These factors explain for each locality the 
adjustments in farm organization. They are factors to be taken into con- 
sideration when organizing a farm in a new locality, especially, and when 
making a change in organization in a well-established farming section. Pro- 
gressive farming means constant change and adjustment to new conditions, 
hence it is of practical utility to the farmer to know the principles of farm 
organization according to which he can make his adjustments with the 
least possible cost. 
Now, when a farmer has chosen the size of his farm, the kind and amount 
of equipment necessary, the breeding stock, the amount and kind of each 
enterprise that such a farm will carry, the number of teams required, and the 
number of men required to operate the system, the farm may be said to be 
organized. The science of farm management or farm organization has the 
task of developing the principles which explain, interpret or give a reason for
-P-A-G-E-90
  86 CONFERENCE FOR EpUCATION 
each step in the process of organization and thus gives the farmer a basis 
for intelligently organizing a farm. 
The office of Farm Management often’ gets letters running something like 
this: 
“T am making arrangements to leave the city and locate on a farm. Have 
bought sixteen acres of land, partly cleared, six miles from town, and intend 
to raise cows, horses, sheep, hogs, some chickens, a few turkeys, ducks and 
various other fowls, a little corn, an acre or two of potatoes, a small garden, 
various kinds of fruit, etc. Please advise me how to make this farm pay. 
Send government bulletins on all these subjects.” 
The first problem of the writer. of this letter is to get the farm organiza- 
tion in his mind. To attempt to carry out such an unorganized plan as is 
suggested would meet with certain failure. The following is an extract from 
a letter which shows that the farmer has grasped the idea of organization 
and consequently will almost assuredly meet with success, provided his prob- 
Jem is worked out on the basis of established principles: 
“T am interested in a large farm eight miles north of town. This farm 
is typical of a large number in this section. Some years ago farmers made 
money; of late years, however, the income from these farms scarcely pays 
interest on the investment. I am satisfied that a reorganization is necessary. 
There are leaks somewhere in our present system. Could you not send an 
expert from your office down here to make a thorough study of this farm 
and the farms in the community, with a view to making out plans that may 
be workable and of benefit to this section?” 
“T have a plan, largely theoretical, but I would like to know if it is feasible. 
You no doubt will be able to tell me where the weak points are. A general 
outline of the plan is as follows: In the first place, I am well convinced that 
we should increase very materially our live stock interests so as to make the 
farm practically a meat factory. Secondly, I believe we ought to sytematize 
the work into departments, having one head for each department and making 
the head of the department responsible for the results of that department. 
All operations not of sufficient importance for classifying under one of the 
departments should be cut out entirely. The departments should be as fol- 
lows: (1) The department of growing crops; (2) the department of live stock; 
(3) the department of accounts and accounting. It seems to me that we should 
produce and sell the following live stock and crops per year, to-wit: 500 hogs 
averaging 200 pounds; 300 lambs; 100 two-year-old cattle; sixty acres of 
tobacco; 250 acres of wheat. Besides these crops there should be raised on 
the farm for feed 150 acres of corn, eighty acres of soy beans, and 160 acres 
of clover, and there should be about 220 acres in pasture. The gross sales 
ought to amount to about $21,320, total expenses $11,320, making a net 
farm income of about $10,000. Such an income would be fairly satisfactory. 
“You will no doubt modify these plans considerably, but I have given you 
an outline of what I have in mind.” 
The development of the principles of farm organization has been along the 
same line that has characterized the development of principles connected with 
the sciences of geology, botany, economics, and others. First, men argued 
each point on the basis of authority of persons or from personal experience
-P-A-G-E-91
  
FARMERS’ CONFERENCE 87 
based on memory. History tells us that grave philosophers for some hundreds 
of years argued the problem, ‘““How many teeth has a horse?” Finally a 
genius arose and counted the teeth in the jawbones of many horses and thus 
established a standard number of teeth. It saved the time of men with good 
brains for more productive work. Just so in regard to many farm problems. 
We have done much good in arguing pro and con about simple verifiable 
problems, for centuries, before we got to the point of gathering the statistics 
on the subject, and found out what the farmers have really achieved in the 
battle with nature. In order to get at the principles of farm organization 
we must study many farms in various localities and take records of their 
achievements, to find out how the most successful farms are organized and 
operated and to get at standards of efficiency by means of which we may 
compare the efficiency of various farms. This method of dealing with the 
problem makes the farmers and their farms answer their own questions. 
In a well established locality the groups of farms making the largest labor 
incomes are, for existing conditions, assumed to be the most efficiently 
organized. The Roman writer, Varro, over 2,000 years ago recognized this 
principle when he gave the following advice to his friend who was on the point 
of organizing and operating a farm: ‘Find out the practice of the last owner, 
that of the neighbors, and make some experiments of your own.” 
Many good farmers distrust principles when stated in a book or by a pro- 
fessional man. They pride themselves on successful achievement by a sort 
of instinct and lack of logic in the processes by which they get results, or if 
credit is given to any forces outside, it is to the influence of the moon or 
planets, and if characterized by special piety, to the Lord, who is believed to 
confer wisdom or special favors on chosen ones. There are excellent marks- 
men who cannot train a gun on an object according to scientific principles, 
but modern rifles you will notice have mechanical adjustments which enable 
the user to shoot straight at long distances. The artillerymen adjust their 
big guns by devices based on correct mechanical engineering principles, 
and need not look at the object intended to be hit. 
The old way of learning everything by experience without leaving a record 
of it, resulted in a few achieving success. The many were content to struggle 
blindly and died believing they had done their duty, but that luck was against 
them. The modern world, however, has grasped the idea that the results of 
past achievements must be analyzed and be made useful for present needs. 
The future farmer should be ashamed not to be able to give to his son an 
intelligent reason for the distribution of the various enterprises on his farm; 
why he plants from year to year so many acres of corn, potatoes, wheat, clover, 
tobacco, orchard grass, etc.; why he grows only a few apples, peaches, or pears; 
why he makes hogs and steers or mules the chief enterprise on his farm. Then, 
too, county agents or anyone who presumes to assist the farmer in better 
agriculture should be required to prove the wisdom of advice given by measur- 
ing the efficiency of a proposed system in terms of standards of practice worked 
out from the experience of farmers in the locality in which they are to be 
applied. 
Some of the most important fundamental factors in farm organization are 
soil fertility, rainfall, temperature, available time for field work, and market

  BOs CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
opportunity. Incidental to these factors, which are of great importance, 
are size of business, quality and marketability of crop, and stock enter- 
prises, and diversity of enterprises. Under size of business an important 
factor is the area of the farm. The few acres so beautifully and romantically 
described by poet farmers are not very well suited to the needs and capacities 
of most farmers in.America. A small farm that will carry a big business is, 
however, in demand. Small farms, like small tools, are efficient under certain 
conditions, but under present economic conditions in the United States, the 
medium-sized farms are more profitable for the average farmer. 
FARM ORGANIZATION WORK IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. 
By J. H. Arnold, U. 8. Department of Agriculture. 
When the farm has been located with reference to natural and economic 
environment, the farmer has left the most difficult problem of adjusting 
the various factors in the internal organization of his farm. He should have 
some basis for deciding intelligently on the proportions in the investment 
of capital and in choosing the enterprises on which time and money are to be 
spent. It is very good general advice to follow the practice of the best farmers 
in the community, but every farm is an individual farm as well as is the im- 
portant fact that the man who is to run it has his characteristic individuality. 
The experiences and achievements of farmers in a given community are of 
little value until data is gathered relative to such experiences and achieve- 
ments. These may be analyzed, interpreted, and put into a form to be useful. 
In other words, general principles may be established which will give useful 
hints to those who have the ability and the attitude of mind to profit by the 
use of principles. It is believed by some that problems concerned with the 
internal organization of a farm, the choosing of crops, stock, the choosing 
of a rotation, the choice of methods of farming—are so personal and com- 
plicated as to details that general principles have little value. Usually this 
idea is held because the problem is a difficult one and the necessary study of 
the details which are so bothersome has not been given. No field of activity 
is so complicated but that it will yield to patient, careful study and analysis. 
If the farmer or anyone else expects the problems to be so simplified that he 
may be told just exactly what he shall plant on a given plot, how he shall 
plant in every case, the exact date when seed should be sown and the crop 
harvested, how many and what operations are necessary in any given year, 
they must be disappointed. Farm organization and practice becomes es- 
tablished in just the same way that other forms of organization in society 
become established. Usually such forms of organization are not the product 
of intelligent planning, but are historical growths or developments through 
the working of economic, political and national laws. Scientific study and 
analysis may discover the underlying principles through which development 
takes place and in turn may be made practical use of in more intelligent 
and less costly development.
-P-A-G-E-93
  FARMERS’ CONFERENCE 89 
Every crop has its labor requirement as well as soil or climatic require- 
ment. Farmers in a given section plant, cultivate, harvest and handle 
various crops in a given manner according to location of farms. These various 
operations, while depending on the weather, which is variable from season 
to season, become pretty well established as to periods in which they are 
performed. The weather of a locality may change, but the climate remains 
practically unchanged, hence the farmer’s practice which depends also on 
such unchanging factors, becomes established as to seasons. Long experience 
with a crop in a section, establishes the number of operations and the rate of 
work in performing them. A study of farm organization and practice from 
this point of view will enable us to establish normal units of labor and power 
required in doing every operation on the farm. There will also be established 
a normal seasonal period in which the operations are done. The farmers 
also by experience, adjust their work to the number of available days in each 
season of the year. Upon this largely depends the diversity of enterprises. 
In the north, where the available days for field work range from 120 to 150, 
time is too short to occupy it profitably on crops alone, so we find in this 
section a remarkable development of the stock industry, which helps to dis- 
tribute the labor throughout the year. There are, of course, other factors 
which make stock raising a profitable industry in this section. In the south, 
where more days are available for field work, crops take up most of the time 
and stock relatively little. The days available for field work are determined 
on the basis of data gathered from farmers. These facts relative to crops 
are worked out and standard units are made to be applied in practical farm 
organization work. The office of Farm Management is probably in closer 
touch with the needs and demands of the farmers than is any other organi- 
zation in existence. We are trying to make available to the farmer in a use- 
ful form the information he seems to need most. Of course only the farmer 
who wants it can profit by it. No way has been found out to convince a 
stubborn and well-to-do man that any way but his is practical and feasible. 
No invention or device can take the place of character, intelligence, courage 
and the progressive attitude of the mind. The educational systems of our 
Jand are responsible for citizens who lack these. Scientific principles are 
useful only to those who will to use them. 
HOW CAN THE CO-OPERATIVE ASSOCIATION MAKE THE COM- 
MUNITY SELF-SUPPORTING? 
Bradford Knapp, Special Agent in charge of Farmer’s Co-operative Demonstra- 
tion Work, U. S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C. 
The problem presented in the question for discussion at this afternoon’s 
meeting is not susceptible of categorical answer. It is, however, my purpose 
to deal with some fundamental principles which I think should be considered 
in determining the question, and to leave to others the discussion of the specific 
question asked. 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
    
90 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
Before going into the discussion, however, permit me to say that I do not 
think that this body or any other body of men, except an actual association 
of farmers who have joined together for co-operative production, can say 
what percentage of the lands per farm should be devoted to the money crops; 
what percentage to supplies, food, etc., and what percentage to systems for 
soil improvement, which might be classed as either money crops or food and 
supplies. The reason is very simple. It is impossible for anyone to fix a 
rule because circumstances differ so materially. 
It depends, first, upon the kind and nature of the products on the farms, 
which are to be sold. You will notice that I use the word “products,” because 
I think that any co-operative community should have more than one cash 
crop. 
It depends, in the second place, on the size of the farms. Third, it depends 
upon the personality of the farmers themselves. An arrangement of land 
that might serve in a truck-growing section, would be no criterion for a dairy 
country; a cotton-producing community would be no basis for a plan for a 
tobacco-producing community. Further than that, if the community is a 
community of fair-sized farms, then every man’s farm in that community 
is a problem by itself, and the relative proportion of the farm of each man 
which should be devoted to the several kinds of crops depends very largely 
on its soil, its topography and also, in my judgment, upon the personality 
of the man himself. While I am a profound believer in co-operation, I am 
also a- profound believer in individualism. In other words, I do not believe 
that co-operation should necessarily drive out all personal initiative. I believe 
that the membership of the co-operative society should all agree upon fun- 
damentals of production; ought to limit the production to quantities that 
experience shows can be properly and profitably marketed; ought to insist 
upon the permanent maintenance of soil fertility and the practice of the 
best farm methods of every kind; ought to foster educational development, 
but leave the particular land on each farm to be a reflection of the per- 
sonality of the man and the family which occupies it. 
There are, however, some principles which should be considered. They 
are: 
(a) As to the money crops, I believe that every community, as far as 
possible, should have more than one crop or product upon which it depends 
for a livelihood. While in Denmark last’ summer, I heard the Danish experts, 
in some of our personal interviews with them, frankly admitting that they 
now had serious doubts as to whether they had not made a mistake in limit- 
ing the agricultural products of Denmark to butter, bacon and eggs. The 
most far-sighted agriculturists and economists of that country are now busily 
thinking what additional products might be interjected into the system 
profitably and thus make it more certain and secure. 
The products selected for marketing should be agreed upon by the entire 
community and should be sufficient in number to permit of the adoption 
of systems of farm management calling for the highest efficiency on the 
individual farms themselves. 
(6) The community should agree to standardize all products to be mar- 
keted through the co-operative arrangement and should devote its most
-P-A-G-E-95
  FARMERS’ CONFERENCE 91 
earnest and conscientious effort towards perfecting that standard and making 
it of the very highest quality. 
(c) Only the best should be marketed and such products as fail to measure 
up to the standard should be saved and utilized for the support of the families 
at home. 
Some of the advantages to be derived from thorough standardization are 
too often overlooked. In the production of crops which are to be marketed 
as such, of course, the standardization is of supreme importance. For example 
—in a community which is producing cotton, co-operation between the far- 
mers to produce the same variety of cotton and to pursue such farm methods 
as will maintain the variety, type, and length, strength and quality of staple, 
if persistently pursued, will ultimately lead to the very best results. Seed 
control is easier in a community where the variety is standardized than in a 
community where every farmer raises a different variety; the dangers of cross- 
pollenation are thus brought to the minimum, and by co-operation a few 
farmers in the community can afford to devote time to producing seed for the 
entire community. These practices should be pursued. 
But, even in those crops which are not directly sold, an advantage will 
be found in all growing the same variety. Especially is this true of corn. 
The variety, of course, must be selected with great care and should be the one 
best adapted to the soil, climate and the surrounding circumstances. 
More important than the standardization of crops even is the standardiza- 
tion of live stock. If the community is going to raise hogs, then they should 
all raise the same kind of hogs; if chickens and eggs, then the same breed will 
be found advantageous. The reason why the large corporation engaged in 
the manufacturing industry has the advantage over the small competitor 
is largely in its advantage in marketing and its large quantity of uniform 
product. Co-operation among farmers can bring a large quantity of uniform 
product, and loyal support of the co-operation by ne individual members 
will bring the advantage in marketing. 
Observation abroad leads to the conclusion that uniformity of breeds of 
livestock is one of the important things that this country has overlooked. 
Examples might be mentioned of counties in this country now beginning 
to reap the advantage due to standardization of breeds of live stock. 
Finally, a community should remember that it has three objects on the 
material side of its existence, and it should always keep these three objects 
before it: ' 
First—The community must, as far as possible, be self-supporting. 
Second—It must build up and maintain the fertility and the productive- 
ness of the soil. 
Third—It must market some cash crops which it should select with great 
care, and should not easily or quickly change, except for fundamental and 
economic reasons. 
I think I should also add a fourth that the community should remember, 
and in mentionimg it I am mentioning the defect which runs through our entire 
American life. We produce things merely for sale. If we could change our 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
    92 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
ethics and produce things which would market because of their superior quality 
we would not need to think quite so much about marketing. This secret 
is one of the most important for every co-operative association to remember. 
HOW CAN THE RURAL COMMUNITY BE MADE SELF- 
SUPPORTING? 
J.C. Robert, A. & M. College, Mississippi. 
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
The subject assigned is one of great economic importance. As I take it, 
the keynote of this convention is efficient production and economic distribu- 
tion. There are so many factors involved that it is hard to know what phase 
of the work to stress. With your permission, however, I will discuss briefly 
some factors influencing the production of farm crops. 
What is the limiting factor in the creation of agricultural produce? Is it 
the poor physical condition of our soil, or the lack of plant food, or farm mis- 
management, or is it due to all of these? I believe it is due more to lack of 
information concerning basic agricultural principles than to any other cause. 
Agriculture is the basis of all true prosperity, and education the foundation 
upon which every permanent system of agriculture must be built. 
The relation of science to soils and crop production has been a prolific 
source of study and investigation during the last fifty years for both field 
and laboratory. Some have claimed that there is little of economic value 
to be learned about soil improvement, others have had the temerity to assert 
that the farmer needed no education other than that he can get between the 
plow-handles. What kind of training does the farmer need? He needs and 
should be supplied with the same facilities for understanding the true art 
and science of his vocation and methods of economically applying existing 
knowledge thereto, as are given men of other professions. 
During the early days, vast areas of virgin soil lay before us. Then, we 
heard little of barren fields, and crop after crop was produced as if there were 
no such things as robbing the soil of plant food. Farmers seemed to have 
thought little of succeeding generations, and as a result, our lands became 
poorer and poorer. Then we heard the voice of Horace Greeley crying, 
“Young man, go west,’’ and the tide of emigration moved toward the Pacific 
Ocean. Recently, while in Chicago, in the Illinois Central Railroad station, 
we saw placarded in bold letters above a southern agricultural exhibit, “Young 
man, go south.” The tide of emigration is moving south. Our lands are 
cheap, our climate ideal, and our soils may be made and kept productive. 
However, our southern States, like many of the northern and western States 
we have visited, are still in need of more workable agricultural information. 
What, then, are we going to do about it? In making the rural communities 
self-supporting, I believe we can render no greater service to the cause than 
by uniting our efforts in establishing industrial educational institutions, 
where the practical problems of rural life are given careful study. These
-P-A-G-E-97
    FARMERS’ CONFERENCE 93 
agricultural colleges and district agricultural high schools, should be the center 
from which emanate practical information on agricultural and home science 
problems that will permeate every community of the State. The farmers’ 
club, the grange, the domestic science club, the farmers’ union, and every other 
organization, having for its purpose the educational, social and financial 
interest of the rural communities, should receive help and inspiration from 
these educational institutions. These industrial schools should reach not only 
the young men and women of educable age on the farm, but those who are 
unable to attend school. <A strong extension department in these agricul- 
tural schools is one of the greatest factors for education of the rural com- 
munities. 
The Federal Department of Agriculture has done good work in the southern 
States. It, like the agricultural colleges and agricultural high schools, is 
taking the gospel of agriculture to those who are not privileged to attend these 
industrial schools. The boys’ corn clubs, and the girls’ tomato clubs demon- 
stration work have caused many rural communities to become interested 
in modern methods and to begin studying. These schools are the agencies 
through which all of the industrial forces working for the good of the farmer 
should originate. They should be the social and industrial centers of the 
rural communities. 
To illustrate better what we have in mind, we may take for discussion in 
the agricultural club the following propositions: What are the essentials 
for growing good crops? In discussing this topic the rural community club 
would naturally divide the subject into the following heads: (1) the seed, 
(2) the soil, (3) plant food, (4) soil water, (5) heat, (6) light, and (7) air. One 
evening may well be devoted to studying one phase of this subject, soil 
water, for instance. Correct ideas as to the function of soil water and best 
methods of storing same in the soil for future use of the plant, may be and 
often are, a most important factor in determining crop yields, which thus 
aid in making the community self-supporting. 
In discussing one phase of this problem, soil water, the leader of the dis- 
cussion might say that an important function of the soils is to act as a store- 
house for moisture. Since all plant food obtained from the soil must be put 
into solution before it can be used by the plant, deficiency of water is one of 
the most prolific sources of crop failure. Many of our green farm plants 
are composed of from sixty to ninety per cent. water. In addition to this, 
from 300 to 500 pounds of water on an average must pass through the plant 
for each pound of dry plant structure produced. Thus we see that the produc- 
tion of four tons of hay per acre would require the giving off from the plants 
of from 1,200 to 2,000 tons of water per acre. This enormous amount of water 
that is constantly being given off by a growing crop, calls on the soil for its 
reserve water supply. If this reserve supply is not present, and water is given 
off—transpired—more rapidly than it is absorbed by the plant roots, the crop 
has a set-back, is stunted, and may wilt and die. If it were possible for 
plants to use all of the water that fell upon the soil, we should never suffer 
from drouths, as a hundred (100) bushel corn crop could be brought to maturity 
with only about 151% inches of rainfall. By proper methods of cultivation, 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
sould it not be the exception rather than the rule, that our crops suffer from 
lack of water? 
Means conducive to soil moisture conservation, then, are of prime im- 
portance and many of our farm operations are for this purpose. Among 
these we would mention deep preparation of land, placing vegetable matter 
in the soil, proper drainage, the destruction of weeds, and frequent shallow 
cultivation. 
Soil water may be divided into three classes: First, surface or ground water, 
also known as gravitational water; second, capillary or film moisture; third, 
hygroscopis moisture. Gravitation water should not, as a rule, be nearer 
than three feet from the surface of the soil. This water does not directly 
supply plants, but acts as reservoir to replace the capillary water as it is re- 
moved. -On an average, about one-half the volume of a good agricultural 
soil is pore space. Under good farm conditions that is occupied by air, which 
is so essential to soil bacteria life and to healthy plants’ growth. If these 
soil pores are filled with gravitational water, air will be excluded, bacteria 
life prevented, plant root growth retarded, and the soil becomes to all prac- 
tical purposes, dead and unproductive. Farm land, then, is never in good 
condition unless well drained, as excess of soil water is as fatal to most farm 
crops as is its deficiency. 
Capillary or film moisture surrounds the individual soil granules, and is 
the water that is used by the plant. The amount of ‘capillary water a soil 
holds depends largely on the surface area of these soil granules in a given 
volume of soil. The smaller these particles, the greater the amount of avail- 
able water for plant growth in any given body of soil. A coarse, sandy soil 
contains about thirty-two per cent. pore space, and the combined surface 
of the sand particles in a cubic foot of such soil for film moisture is about 11,000 
square feet. Finest clay soil, on the other hand, has about fifty per cent. 
pore space, and the combined surface of its soil particles may be 170,000 
square feet, or about four acres square surface, against one-fourth acre sur- 
face in the coarse, sandy soil. Between these two extremes we have all grades 
of agricultural soils with their various combinations and structural arrange- 
ments. We thus see that the physical arrangement of soils has much to do 
with their crop productive power. The hair roots come directly in contact 
with this film moisture and remove it as rapidly as needed by the plant. As 
this is removed, other water, if in the subsoil, is drawn to take its place. 
We believe that the united and individual study by the farmers of such 
agricultural topics as the above would go far towards solving many of the 
perplexing problems of agricultural and home economics. Help at these 
meetings should be secured from the colleges and agricultural high schools, 
as well as from the county, State and federal agricultural experts. 
Every farmer should have at least a small, well-selected agricultural library. 
He should take one or two good weekly agricultural periodicals that deal in 
a practical and scientific manner with his local conditions, and he should 
be a regular subscriber to one or two magazines of general information. 
The mental, physical, moral and industrial education of its citizens is the 
greatest index to the status of our rural communities.

  FARMERS’ CONFERENCE 95 
CONFERENCE CONCERNING THE PURCHASE OF FARM 
REQUIREMENTS. 
This section or conference met for three successive days, and was presided 
over respectively by J. N. Harper, Clemson College; J. F. Duggar, Auburn, 
Alabama; and J. C. Robert, Agricultural College, Mississippi. 
Considerable attention was paid to the best means of purchasing commercial 
fertilizers, which is probably the largest single item purchased by southern 
farmers. Those who discussed this subject were in agreement to the effect 
that the use of commercial fertilizers is a necessity-on southern farms, but 
that much of the value of commercial fertilizer is wasted because of want of 
agricultural knowledge. 
It was the consensus of opinion that the cost of fertilizers purchased for 
cash was so far below the time prices of fertilizers that farmers should make 
every possible effort, and all needed sacrifices, in order to make their pur- 
chases for cash—borrowing, if necessary, from a local bank, for this purpose. 
All speakers realized the necessity for improved means of obtaining short- 
time credits. Mr. Shuford explained how a community in North Carolina, 
where dairying is the principal industry, agreed to obtain cash for the pur- 
chase of fertilizers, and other farm requirements, somewhat as follows: The 
local farmers’ union stands security for a certain amount of money, borrowed 
of a local bank, by any member, for productive purposes. The local union 
itself is secured by the fact that the note given by the borrowing member 
must be endorsed by two or three property owners, also members of the local 
union. 
The fact that this community depends chiefly on the sale of dairy products, 
and, therefore, obtains its income in monthly installments, makes it possible 
for short-time loans to be repaid by installments and more promptly than in 
cotton-growing communities. ; 
Among those who participated in the discussion of this conference were 
Messrs. Harper, Duggar, Robert, Shuford, Moran, Niven, and a number of 
others. 
SuGGEsTIONS FoR ForMATION oF Farmers’ CLuBs IN CoMMUNITIES WHERE

THE CONFERENCE ON CO-OPERATIVE PURCHASE. 
Organization: 
1. Some man, or self-constituted body of men and women, call a meeting 
at some convenient place, elect temporary chairman and secretary, and have 
someone state the purpose or purposes of the meeting, which should be in 
general as follows: 
(a) To improve the social, educational, and recreational life of all the 
people in the community. 
(b) To discuss general farm life problems. 
(c) To co-operate in improving roads, schools and all other community 
conditions.
-P-A-G-E-100
  
96 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
(d) To discuss and plan for co-operative buying and selling in the large s 
possible amounts of all things sold from or raised on the farm. 
2. After a general discussion, committees should be appointed on constitu- 
tion and by-laws, nominations, programs, etc. 
3. At the second meeting, constitution and by-laws, name of club, state- 
ment of purposes, dues to defray necessary running expenses, together with 
a small per cent. of all gross business (one-half of one per cent., more or less), 
to be held as a sinking fund to be used as the club may direct, and the election 
of regular officers consisting of president, vice-president, and secretary- 
treasurer, who ought also:to be business manager, should be determined upon. 
4. We believe there should be as simple a form of constitution and by-laws 
and as little ritualistic work as possible. 
Every member should know the results of all business transactions, but the 
details should be the work of the executive committee. 
5. Meetings should be held every two weeks with as much time as possible 
devoted to educational, social and recreational activities. 
6. We recommend cash payments for all goods where possible as the surest 
way of establishing sound credit. 
7. We recommend that all farm products be carefully graded and inspected 
before being put on the market, in order that the purchaser may be absolutely 
certain of the quality and quantity of articles bought without having to in- 
spect them. 
8. We recommend that the club deal directly with the manufacturer or 
nearby reliable, wholesale dealer, and where credit is necessary for productive 
purposes, that the community stand as surety for its own members. 
9. We recommend the co-operative purchase of the following: 
Fertilizer, farm implements, insecticides, heavy or bulky groceries and such 
other things as the club can buy in large quantities. 
10. We recommend the co-operative ownership of thoroughbred sires for 
the improvement of live stock, and the purchase of farm machinery too costly 
for individual ownership.

  THE CO-OPERATIVE PURCHASE OF FARM MACHINERY IN THE 
COTTON BELT. 
J.C. Robert, A. & M. College, Mississippi. 
In this discussion we desire to confine ourselves exclusively to one phase of 
the machinery problem, namely, the co-operative use of farm machinery 
by the small farmer. The last century was conspicuous for our industrial 
emancipation and the abolition of many burdensome forms of toil. This
-P-A-G-E-101
       FARMERS’ CONFERENCE 97 
has been accomplished by labor-saving devices which have, in a large measure, 
replaced the work formerly done by our bondsmen. The Cotton Belt has many 
agricultural problems to solve, but the economic pfoduction of cotton, rice, 
sugar, corn, and other staple products, involves no subject of greater im- 
portance than the use of labor-saving machinery. Our agricultural prosperity 
depends largely upon the amount of “team work” that our farmers are willing 
to do. We have progressed along many lines, but in the main have sadly 
neglected the co-operative feature of our farm business methods. Even the 
“log rolling,’ the “cotton picking,” and the “house raising” have been 
relegated to the past. 
For practically every type of farm work some useful machine has been 
created. Its development has revolutionized agricultural methods and in- 
creased our productive efficiency. Ninety-seven per cent. of the Colonial 
settlers were engaged in farming, for, with the crude methods of those days, 
it was all that a family could do to produce sufficient food and clothing. Today 
about thirty per cent. of the population of our States are engaged in farming; 
for, by the use of improved farm machinery they produce, more economically, 
sufficient food for themselves, and for the other seventy per cent. of our 
90,000,000 population, besides exporting a large amount to feed those who have 
not yet appreciated the great blessing of improved machinery. In 1850 
it required four hours and one-half to grow, harvest, and shell a bushel of 
corn, while today this work requires only forty minutes’ time. 
The greatest need of the Cotton Belt today is more specific, workable agri- 
cultural knowledge and a willingness to put it into effect. Our average white 
farmer does not do as well as he knows, nor does he know what he should 
about basic agricultural principles. Our southern farmers have for many 
years pursued an injudicious system of farming. Our clean cultured, one 
crop, cotton system, has placed us in an unenviable position, like that of 
some of the northern and western States when, a few years ago, they continually 
cultivated wheat. The cotton boll weevil, however, seems destined to play 
the same part in reorganization of our methods as did the chinch bug in the 
west. Today many farming companies are being formed in the south, modern 
machinery is being installed, and the margin of profit is made correspondingly 
greater. 
Today, as I see it, many of us are face to face with two propositions in the 
Cotton Belt; one is corporation farming and the other is co-operative farming. 
The margin of profit is greater in either case than it is with the isolated, in- 
dividual efforts of the small, honest and in many cases, energetic but mis- 
guided farmer. Farm machinery differs many ways from that used in trans- 
portation and manufacturing. In the latter case it is used twelve months 
in the year, while many of the most expensive farm machines, if owned by 
but one farm, after doing all the work on that farm will be idle for eleven 
months in the year. 
Why should not the small farmers of our Cotton Belt co-operate with each 
other in the purchase of modern machinery? The average investment per 
capita in such machinery bears a close relation to the average income per 
farm worker, as shown by a recent census report. In Florida, for instance, 
the average investment in farm machinery, per farm worker was found to be 
    
-P-A-G-E-102
       
    98 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
$30.43, and the average income per farm worker, $119.72. In Iowa, on the 
other hand, the average investment in farm machinery, per farm’ worker, 
was $196.55, and the average income, per farm worker, is $611.11. In Ala- 
bama, the expenditure for farm machinery was $23.40 and the average income, 
per farm worker, was $143.98. In North Dakota farm machinery investment, 
per capita, was ten times as great as in Alabama, or $238.84, and the average 
income, per farm worker, was more than five times as great, or $755.62. 
There are many economic labor-saving devices that we may purchase co- 
operatively. Among these we would mention the following: 
Corn shredder, corn harvester and binder, silage cutter, silo frames, grain 
drill, hay press, grist mill, fanning mill, manure spreader, tile ditching machine, 
threshing machine, lime crusher, pea huller, canning outfit, farm level, syrup 
machine, spraying machine, stump puller, corn sheller, peanut picker, lime 
and fertilizer distributor, potato digger, horse clipper, stalk cutter, cement 
and tile machine, clover huller, and twenty-five horsepower kerosene tractor, 
with four or five gang plows. There are many other machines that could 
probably be used to good advantage co-operatively. Of course, it is always 
better for a farmer to own machinery if he can afford to do so, but if he cannot, 
it is far better for him to own it co-operatively than not to have it at all. 
We must develop the spirit of co-operation. 
A lighter tractor than the one above mentioned might be used to better 
advantage in the humid districts of our Cotton Belt. In the Thresherman’s 
Review and Power Farming Magazine of last November, an article on Gas 
Tractor Investigation, of Prof. L. W. Chase, replying to a circular letter 
sent 313 farmers, showed that the gas tractor had been used in twenty- 
six kinds of work; among these were plowing, disking, road work, rolling, 
tilling, threshing, harrowing, grinding, silo filling, drilling, harvesting, shell- 
ing, listing, corn, small grain work, elevating grain, seeding, sawing, hauling, 
well drilling, pumping water and baling hay. 
Why is it that corporations can farm more economically than the individual 
small farmer? Recent investigation by the Federal Department of Farm 
Management has shown conclusively that farm labor, teams and farm machin- 
ery—the most important factor in determining the profits in farming—cannot 
be used to best advantage on the small farm, which constitutes an inefficient 
unit. Some interesting statistics have also been collected by Prof. G. F. 
Warren, which we believe may be applied to our southern conditions. This 
information shows that while the gross receipts from a farm, where general 
farming with modern machinery was employed, sixty acres and less in size 
were larger than those from sixty to two hundred acres, the net receipts 
were greatest in the largest farm, and that farms smaller than sixty acres, 
were operated at a loss. This decided difference in profit and loss was due 
mainly to the increased cost of human labor, animal power, and farm machines, 
in proportion to income from the farm. These statistics showed that the 
area farmed by $200 worth of human labor was five times as great on farms of 
200 acres as on farms thirty acres or less in size. 
Agricultural motors are usually divided into animal motors, water motors, 
hot-air engines, windmills, steam engines, internal-combustion engines, and 
electric motors. The animal body is the most wonderful machine we have.
-P-A-G-E-103
FARMERS’ CONFERENCE 99 
It “feeds itself, maintains itself, controls itself, and reproduces itself.’””’ Man 
has never yet devised a machine that possesses all of these wonderful prop- 
erties. i 
It is quite likely fat within the near future an eight. to ten-horsepower 
tractor will be placed within the reach of our southern farmers, but the 
heavy, efficient draft horse will, for many years, be the main tractor upon 
which the Cotton Belt must depend. The writer recently saw four heavy 
draft mares, weighing possibly 1,700 pounds each, hitched to a two-gang 
riding plow. Here we have between 7,000 and 8,000 pounds forming the 
animal tractor, thrown into the collar, and plowing six to eight inches deep. 
How many farm hands does it take to drive 7,000 pounds of horse-flesh in 
your communities? 
We need more horses, better horses, and heavier horses. The economic 
use of horse power makes it necessary to keep the animal employed. Three 
to five horses are the least number that can be efficiently used with most 
modern farm machinery, and such machinery can do the work on a 200 or 
300-acre farm as well as on a smallfarm. In the preparation of land, the one- 
horse plow should be relegated to the days of the sickle and cradle. One horse 
properly directed, can do the work of ten men, while his expense of keep on 
the farm is about one-half that. of the board of a farm hand. We thus see 
that a farm boy who drives a good four-horse team to a gang plow is doing 
as much work as if the horses were replaced by forty men. In Huropean 
countries the work is done largely by the individual farmer, while in America 
horse power is largely used in place of human power. Huznan power is the 
most expensive of all forms of energy. ‘If the small farmer buys the machinery 
it is at too great cost per acre. If he goes without machinery, the loss in time 
and yield is even more serious.” 
One of the greatest needs of our southern farms today is deeper and better 
breaking of the soil, and the incorporation of vegetable matter into the 
structure, and its frequent shallow cultivation. Good plowing is a prime factor 
in successful farming. For this we must have good machinery, efficient 
motor power, and good judgment to direct its use. A seed bed thus produced 
may form a loose, well-aerated, well-drained, sanitary home for the plant, 
and be supplied with the roughage (vegetable food) and concentrate (mineral) 
food that are so essential for the maximum crop production. Such a store- 
house, properly tilled, will not be found lacking in available soil moisture; 
its physical and chemical conditions will be greatly improved; and biological 
processes, of which we now hear so much, will be carried on in this, the far- 
mer’s laboratory, night and day by the multi-millions of microscopic servants 
that pay tribute to his use of modern machinery. 
Let us suppose that two of my farm neighbors and I own, together, a corn 
harvester, silage cutter, threshing machine, manure spreader, and a hay 
baler. Can we not so plan our work as to co-operate harmoniously in the 
use of this valuable, labor-saving equipment? Is it not of great advantage 
to me to have use of this entire machinery at one-third of the cost, even if 
both of my neighbors get a few days’ use of it before I do? We can plan our 
silage corn a few days apart—as a rule it is not imperative that the grain 
be threshed any particular day, and the hay baler and manure spreader

can be used so as to not conflict. These five machines may be purchased 
and kept in repair for about $1,000. If well cared for, their average life should 
equal ten years. At five per cent. interest the ten years’ use of these farm 
machines would result in the aggregate cost of $1,500.00. Is it not much 
better for me to use some forethought in planning my work, and co-operate 
with my brother farmer, and thus save $1,000.00 on the purchase price? 
Its purchase price could be divided in proportion to the amount used by each. 
We might make a similar comparison with many other valuable farm 
machines, but the principle is the same in all. The co-operative use of farm 
machinery might be used in rice industry in Louisiana. Large tracts of land 
adjacent to bodies of water are made suited to rice growing by means of 
large pumping engines and a carefully devised system of canals, Land, 
formerly considered of little value and which, in 1890, could be purchased 
for a few dollars per acre, is now valued at from $50.00 to $75.00 per acre. 
Power pumping plants raise water from rivers, lakes, and wells and, by a 
series of canals and dams, distribute it over a wide area. The grain binder 
and threshing machines harvest this crop rapidly and economically. In 
1904 Texas and Louisiana are reported to have produced $13,000,000.00 
worth of rice. 
What may we expect the future to bring forth in the co-operative use of 
farm machinery? I believe the next generation will see, in many sections of 
the Cotton Belt, central electric power plants sending to the nearby farms 
motive power to draw water, saw wood, grind feed, light our residences and 
out-houses, run the turning lathe in the wood shop, sharpen implements in the 
tool shop, move our hay crops, run our hay press and syrup mill, milk our 
cows, run the separators, do our churning, run the washing machine, the vacu- 
um cleaner and sewing machine, do our cooking, and to do many other forms 
of work on our farms—work which is now done at expense, or not done at all. 
In fact, there are many waterfalls, the power of which should now be harnessed 
and used co-operatively. 
The co-operative use of farm machinery is possible and thoroughly prac- 
ticable. Those who fail to use it fail to reap the reward incident to the bur- 
dens thereby removed. In order that we may properly appreciate its value, let 
us imagine that agricultural machinery had been removed and its manufacture 
a lost art. Where would we be agriculturally? Thousands and millions of 
people now engaged in manufacture, transportation, commerce and the 
professions, would have to engage in farming to make food for themselves. 
We would turn our dial of progress back many centuries. 
By co-operation, even our smallest farmers may multiply many times their 
efficiency. They may thus “enjoy the service of crops of mechanical slaves 
more efficient, more capable, and more subservient to the will of the master 
than the gang of human chattel that served the planter of the south fifty 
years ago, or the retinue of vassals that ministered to the barons of mediaeval 
Europe,” without the evils attendant thereto.

TRAINING LEADERS FOR RURAL LIFE. 
Senator Warr T. Brown, Ragland, Ala. 
It is, indeed, a great privilege to take part in this meeting, which, I am 
sure, will mark an era in the development of country life. This Conference 
of Business Men is an index of a strong sentiment for more attractive condi- 
tions for rural life and is the promise and prophecy of great things to come. 
It is a movement which looks to the prosperity and happiness of country life. 
The south is awake to the marvelous possibilities that lie in her fertile 
fields, her rich deposits of coal and iron ore, her great forests and her wonder- 
ful water power, and must look to the schools to supply the skill that will 
enable her to utilize all her natural resources to the fullest extent. Without 
trained workers, our advantages will avail us little and our resources will 
remain practically unproductive unless taken advantage of by others. 
If the south is to have an unchecked development of her resources, she 
must have efficient human labor supplied in adequate quantities, and her 
most urgent and crying need today, is for more trained and skilled workers. 
We are building a new south and one of its cornerstones is a school. I 
believe we acknowledge our educational obligations and are preparing to 
pay with compound interest. Education to be effective, must be practical 
in its bearing upon the home, the farm and the factory, and national in out- 
look. Our schools are face to face with the stern duty of preparing the youth 
cf the land for social efficiency, and if we would derive the best results we 
must give the kind of education the children need. In farming centers, we 
should have schools dealing directly with the problems of farm life; in the cities 
schools which teach business principles; and in the mineral districts, schools 
adapted to that section. 
Ninety per cent. of the boys of our land never enter the high schools, but, 
each year, pass into the world to join the vast army of workers, and the 
majority of them must earn a living by the work of the hands, yet we force 
them through an eight years’ course of study which only leads to the high 
school and college, neither of which they will ever enter. This, it seems to 
me, is an ill-directed effort. Of course, everyone should have a common school 
education to the extent they will use in their daily lives, but to this must 
be added other important essentials, the practical side, the knowing how to 
do and to make things. Teaching along theoretical lines only and leaving 
off the practical side, is of little value. We need schools which teach in that 
practical way and which prepare the student on leaving the same to be able   
.
-P-A-G-E-107
  Bustness MEN’s CONFERENCE 103 
to handle their own affairs successfully and to step immediately into the best 
paying positions. 
It seems that all other classes of industry have received a greater impetus 
from intelligent thought than agriculture. Agriculture has been largely 
passed by, and too widely the idea has prevailed that all a man has to do to 
become a farmer, is to scratch the ground a little, throw some seed into it, 
plow once in a while, and trust the Lord to do the rest. This old idea has be- 
come obsolete, and we are beginning to realize that to become a successful 
farmer, we must have’special training in scientific methods. We must teach 
the rising generation of farmers methods whereby the depletion of our soils 
may be checked, as well as the most scientific methods of agriculture, if they 
would keep abreast of our modern commercial and industrial life. 
The farmers need that quickening, vitalizing business touch, which will 
not only show them how to grow their products, but which will teach them how 
to market to the best advantage. The most productive thing is practical in- 
telligence properly applied, and this must be done in agriculture as well as 
anything else. When our farmers are scientifically trained in agriculture, 
and they are able to grow twice the amount of produce with the same amount 
of labor than formerly under the old methods, thereby lessening their burdens, 
increasing the value of their lands, and their own earning power, this would 
enable them to better educate their children and give them more of the com- 
forts of life, and at the same time would make farm life more attractive and 
would be an inducement for the boys and girls to remain on the farm instead 
of going away. 
The farm and shop are so closely allied, that whatever training benefits 
one should benefit the other, and each should have special training along his 
special line of work. The farmer must have a market for his surplus, if he 
is to be prosperous, and the nearer the market, the better prices he is able to 
command and the more valuable his farm lands become. There can be no 
prosperity until there is something over and above necessity, so prosperity 
begins where necessity ends. The man in the shop must be skilled in his 
labor, in order that his earning power may be greater and he be better prepared ° 
to buy the products of the farm and have a surplus left if he, too, would become 
prosperous and educate his children. Our,rural mail routes, parcel post, and 
the building of good roads is making of the two classes closer neighbors day 
by day. 
The United States Government is becoming very much exercised over 
the conservation of its resources and both State and counties are very much 
interested in the building of good roads and the stopping of the waste of 
money, which is all good work. But a still greater work would be the saving 
of the human energy of our young manhood. If these energies were all skilled 
and put to work in the proper channel, what a vast amount of good would 
be accomplished. This task in the south must be worked out through the 
schools. ; 
If the national government would give national aid to agricultural and 
industrial education, together with the States, which I feel sure they will 
do at some early day, it would be the wisest investment that could’ be made. 
Money spent in this way should not be regarded as an expense, but an invest- 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  104 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
ment—an absolutely necessary investment—if we would raise the standard 
of our citizenship. The present tariff bill carries an income tax, whereby 
millions of dollars will flow into the U. 8. Treasury. If a certain amount of 
this tax was set aside, annually, for vocational education, we could hardly 
imagine the good it would accomplish. Along this line, is one of the greatest 
works that our U. 8. Senators and Congressmen could do for the masses of 
the people. 
Technical schools are becoming more and more the favorites of those seek- 
ing education, and all schools where special training: is given are crowded, 
therefore we should realize the necessity and importance of such schools and 
support them. Both States and counties should help maintain them. No 
State can better invest its money than in helping to develop manly and 
womanly characters of its citizens, preparing them to think and act for them- 
selves and to better meet the responsibilities of life and at the same time 
help to develop its own resources. Schools and colleges are not always es- 
tablished by the States from a standpoint of charity for the poor and ignorant, 
but from the motive that it would add strength, happiness and prosperity 
to the commonwealth. It is common sense business acumen and wisdom 
for the State and nation to foster and encourage all educational institutions 
which are for the uplift of its citizenship, and no better investment can be 
made. Give the youth of the land an opportunity to secure a practical educa- 
tion and training and in a few years it will return in a manifold way. 
The State of Alabama is leading out along this line and has located the 
Alabama School of Trades and Industries at Ragland, where white boys will 
be given practical education and training. The States should establish special 
industrial schools in the different States, of such nature that the masses would 
be able to attend, between certain ages, even if they should start with only 
one school of the kind in each State and increase the number as conditions 
demand or would justify. The sentiment of our public schools is drifting 
to the same idea, but this special training cannot be successfully put in all the 
public schools, owing to the lack of money and because of other conditions. 
For this reason, it is best to concentrate on special schools as conditions justify. 
From these schools will come expert and trained leaders to the rural districts, 
and from these districts, the most healthful and moral citizenship will spring 
up. It has been demonstrated by the University of Wisconsin that the boy 
reared on a farm or in a rural environment is ten per cent. better in mathe- 
matics than boys reared under other conditions. This shows, therefore, that 
it is well for boys to be reared on the farm or in a rural district if they can 
have the proper education and training. Then, it appears to me that the most 
important thing would be to arrange our educational system in the rural 
districts to meet the demands, and that not only the boys on the farms and 
in the rural districts would take advantage of it, but the parents in the cities 
would send their children to the country to get them away from city tempta- 
tions. This can best be accomplished by the active interest of commercial 
bodies and those in a position to see the actual conditions and necessity for 
such schools. 
The legislative committee of the Farmers’ Union of Alabama has endorsed 
schools of this type, also the Federation of Women’s Clubs.

Alabama has also a reformatory, where practical education and training is 
given to the criminal boys who are sent there to be reformed, and is doing 
good work, and many young men have been reformed there and learned a 
skilled trade at the same time. This shows the great necessity of such train- 
ing for the criminal boys, and what about the flower of our young man- 
hood? It has been scientifically demonstrated that the average boy growing 
into manhood is valued at $6,000.00, while, if he has special or technical 
training, he is valued at from $15,000.00 to $18,000.00, or more than 200 
per cent. over the untrained boy. This is conclusive proof that it pays from 
a standpoint of wealth. 
EXTENSION-DEMONSTRATION AGENCIES AS A FACTOR IN 
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT. 
By Dr, Andrew M. Soule, President Georgia State College of Agriculture. 
Georgia has made wonderful strides along the lines of agricultural develop- 
ment within the past few years. The records of achievement in this direc- 
tion are substantiated by the figures issued by the U. S. Bureau of the Census. 
The State justly prides itself on its growth in this direction and its citizens 
are naturally anxious to maintain the enviable position already won. It 
is probably more generally recognized and conceded now than ever before, 
that to do this successfully calls for the development of all those agencies 
best calculated to acquire and distribute definite knowledge in an easily 
appreciable form. Naturally, the liveliest interest is being displayed in all 
phases of education as it relates to agriculture. While this is only one of the 
offensive weapons used in the campaign of development recently inaug- 
urated, it must be regarded by all thinking people as one of the most potent 
and the fact that that it is so recognized is shown by the growth of the State 
college of agriculture at Athens, and the extension-demonstration agencies 
with which its work is correlated. A recital of some of the things accomplished 
along this line graphically illustrates the forward strides which Georgia is 
making along lines of agricultural endeavor, and will prove as illuminating 
as any other suggestions which can be offered under the circumstances. 
In the beginning, as always, a group of patriotic men were responsible 
for the reorganization and establishment of the State college of agriculture 
at Athens some seven years ago. That their efforts in this direction have 
been appreciated is illustrated by the statement that 1,827 men and women 
have received instruction therein with the period mentioned, and prac- 
tically all of them are now resident in the State and using the knowledge 
acquired through the courses of instruction offered at Athens to give efficient 
direction to our agricultural practice. That the interest in the courses in 
agriculture is not of a superficial nature, is shown by the fact that nearly 
half of those pursuing work in the institution have taken what are termed 
degree courses, and are in position to serve the State acceptably in the great 
variety of ways which her varied agricultural interests make possible.
-P-A-G-E-110
  
106 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
It early became apparent to the board of trustees of the State college of 
agriculture that it should not confine its efforts to the instruction of those who 
enroll at Athens, but that it should endeavor to reach and serve the adult 
farmers and the thousands of boys and girls scattered through the length and 
breadth of Georgia. The institution’s first motto was, ‘To do something for 
everyone,” and it has lived up to this high resolve as perfectly as circum- 
stances would permit. Its next slogan was, ‘“The State of Georgia for a cam- 
pus,” in order that definite and constructive agricultural information of a 
type easily appreciated by the average citizen and of immediate practical 
value might be distributed broadcast throughout the length and breadth 
of the State and for the placing of our agriculture on a definite basis. The 
work was first commenced by the operation of educational trains. Later the 
State was asked for a specific appropriation for extension work that farmers’ 
institutes, teachers’ institutes, extension schools, soil surveys, the establish- 
ment of test plats, the distribution of pure-bred live stock, the organization 
of boys’ and girls’ clubs, and demonstration work with adult farmers might 
be inaugurated. The response on the part of the State has been generous 
from the start, and Georgia is conducting an extension-demonstration service 
correlated with the Bureau of Plant Industry through the office of Farmers’ 
Co-operative Demonstration Work, the Bureau of Soils and the Bureau of 
Animal Industry, which has attracted widespread attention. The college 
and the co-operating agencies, through the support accorded them by chambers 
of commerce, boards of trade, the farmers’ union, the State superintendent 
of public instruction and his school supervisors, the county school com- 
missioners and teachers, and the various agricultural organizations, are reach- 
ing and influencing in a helpful manner hundreds of thousands of people each 
year. It is believed that the record in this direction has not been surpassed 
in any State, and it affords me great pleasure to acknowledge at this time that 
the end attained has only been possible because of the sympathetic and har- 
monious relationships which have existed between all the agencies enumerated. 
A review of the nature of the task involved may be undertaken with propri- 
ety at this juncture, for it is apparent at the outset that the issues are of a 
potential character. Those who have studied the situation realize that a 
State such as Georgia needs at least 100,000 aggressive scientific farmers. 
She should have at least 15,000 expert stock growers, 10,000 truckers and 
orchardists, 5,000 dairymen, 500 agricultural engineers, 500 teachers of 
agricultural chemistry, 700 teachers of applied agricultural science, 2,500 
agricultural teachers for the rural schools, 600 teachers of manual arts as 
applied to agriculture, 600 plant breeders, 150 investigators and research 
workers, 300 county agents to supervise the demonstration work and the 
boys’ and girls’ corn, cotton, pig and poultry clubs, and at least 50 foresters. 
In all we need at present 35,900 especially trained men. These figures indicate 
that agricultural institutions must, therefore, be most liberally endowed 
and supported if they are to discharge the duties and responsibilities which 
our modern civilization places upon them. 
Next it is proper to inquire if the training of such a large number of youths 
is wise and advisable on the part of the State. The answer is an emphatic 
yes. The following is one of many illustrations which might be quoted to
-P-A-G-E-111
    BustnEss MEN’s CONFERENCE 107 
prove its truthfulness. A firm in Maryland lost their peach crop in 1912 
by brown rot. They had a 100-acre orchard with 10,000 well-developed trees 
therein. They secured an expert through the extension service of the Mary- 
land Agricultural College to spray and supervise this area in 1913. Apply- 
ing the fertilizer, pruning and spraying the orchard cost $9,326.69. The re- 
ceipts were $35,165.53, leaving a net profit of $25,838.84. Should anyone 
question the authenticity of this statement, the names of the parties in question 
will be cheerfully furnished, and they will gladly certify to its correctness. 
It is a wonderful thing that the raw product of a State in the form of its 
youth may be so trained through a four years’ course of instruction as to add 
to their efficiency in the manner indicated. Remember also, that this service 
was performed by a young man on a meagre salary, working for the benefit 
of the farmers of his State and on a plantation where the owners conceived 
that they were broadly educated men so far as orcharding was concerned. 
Any type of instruction of so forceful and essential a character should be most 
liberally endowed by the State, not for material returns, but for the uplift 
in all directions, which results in the elimination of waste, the conservation 
of energy, the production of an ample and wholesome food supply, and the 
earning of a sufficient increment on invested capital to give stability to the 
industries of the community chiefly concerned. 
The more people who can be reached through a properly organized and di- 
rected extension-demonstration service, the greater the benefits accruing 
to the State, and with this end in view, Georgia held last year seven extension 
schools attended by 4,710 people; 109 farmers’ institutes in as many counties, 
attended by 31,778 people; five teachers’ institutes, attended by 650 people; 
643 meetings with corn club boys and adult farmers in 142 counties attended 
by 83,792 people; 152 meetings for girls and women in 28 counties attended 
by 13,775 people. There were also 46 miscellaneous meetings held in 37 coun- 
ties attended by 11,859 people.. 75,000 people attended the State Fair at 
Macon, and the Georgia-Carolina Fair at Augusta where elaborate exhibits, 
illustrating the work of the college and the boys’ and girls’ clubs were made. 
In all 949 meetings were held in practically every county in the State. The 
attendance aggregated 218,063, and the extension representatives traveled 
188,299 miles to attend these meetings. This is indeed a remarkable record 
and shows how widespread the interest is in agricultural education in all its 
varied forms in the State of Georgia, and what a hearty response the people 
are making to the extension-demonstration workers. Remember that this 
covers the work of but a twelve-month. These records are prepared on the 
basis of the figures required in the reports of the U. S. Department of Agri- 
culture and the attendance is reckoned by sessions. 
The widespread interest in work of this character is testified to by the 
liberal support accorded it in a financial way by the patriotic citizens of 
Georgia. Of course, the work is seriously hampered by lack of funds to main- 
tain it on a State and county-wide basis, and Georgia cannot be completely 
organized until the State realizes its obligation in this direction and appropria- 
ates the necessary money. At present, therefore, the demonstration work 
is largely of a charitable nature. It receives direct support from the people 
of the State to the amount of $25,000.00; the girls’ canning clubs to the ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
108 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
tent of $8,000.00; prizes and scholarships for boys and girls and adult farmers 
aggregate $17,810.00 more, making $50,310.00 in all, which is contributed 
to the work directly by the people. More convincing evidence of the general 
interest and belief in the value of extension-demonstration work could not 
be asked for than this, for when people are ready to endorse a proposition 
by direct contribution of funds, it is clearly evident that they subscribe 
emphatically to the doctrines which it represents. 
The growth of the boys’ corn club work in Georgia has been quite remark- 
able. It started in 1910 with one agent; in 1913 there were seven agents. 
The first year 310 reports were received, the average yield of the boys reporting 
being forty-five bushels per acre. Five boys made 100 bushels; the highest 
yield was 105 bushels per acre. In 1913 the work was in progress in 142 
counties, the active enrollment being 9,015. The average yield per acre of 
the 3,000 boys reporting was fifty-two bushels at a cost of forty-six cents per 
bushel. Ninety boys made over 100 bushels, and the highest yield was 181.7 
bushels. The cost to the State of this remarkable record on the part of her 
youthful citizens in 1913 was $7,500.00. More than 100 school fairs were 
held in Georgia, at which $5,000.00 in prizes was awarded. One hundred 
and six scholarships valued at $25.00 each, were provided for the boys’ short 
course held at the college last January. The State Fair offered $1,500.00 
in prizes to the boys, and the Atlanta Corn Show $2,500.00. Three thousand 
exhibits, representing as many acres in corn, were displayed at the Atlanta 
Corn Show. Fifteen hundred visited Atlanta during the show and were 
entertained in the homes of leading citizens. 
Has all this been worth while? The records show that since 1909 the yield 
of corn in Georgia has increased by 30,000,000 bushels, equivalent to $30,- 
000,000.00. The State has made a slight investment in her youth and reaped 
a stream of gold as a reward. The least of all the benefits to Georgia and to 
the boys, however, has been the increase in monetary returns. Surely they 
have obtained a new vision. Surely they have developed a new purpose in 
life. They realize that they can achieve more where their fathers probably 
were doubtful. Many of these boys have been fired with an ambition to 
educate themselves and become great leaders in their communities. They 
have learned that through intellectual development and the ability to inter- 
pret nature successfully they can become powerful constructive factors for 
themselves and their State. 
The girls’ club work is of more recent origin, but equally gratifying results 
have been obtained. Out of an enrollment of 2,500 girls in twenty-eight 
counties last year, 463 completed reports; 55,173 No. 3 cans of tomatoes were 
put up, valued at $12,168.00; each tenth acre garden represented a cost of 
$11.00 and a profit of $23.26. Eron Dooley, of Oconee county, said that it 
cost her $7.00 to plow, fertilize, seed and cultivate her land. Gathering the 
crop represented an outlay of $3.00, preserving $10.00, while the cans or con- 
tainers, cost $30.00. Her total outlay for these purposes was $43.00, and for 
all purposes, $50.00. The value of her crop was $141.50, leaving a net profit 
of $96.50. Clyde Sullivan, of Ousley, Lowndes county, the champion tomato’ 
grower of the United States, last year raised on her tenth acre 5,000 pounds 
of tomatoes. These were put up in 1,714 No. 3 cans. The value of her crop 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
Business MEN’s CONFERENCE 109 
was $229.26, and the cost $98.87, leaving a profit of $132.39. This little girl 
lived out in the open with God’s providence for companionship; with the 
trees and flowers and singing birds to inspire her, and with the sun and fresh 
air to invigorate her body and refresh her mind. She cultivated the qualities 
of thrift, integrity and perseverance—an achievement worth while. She is 
a better and nobler citizen than before she undertook this work. She will 
go forward and achieve a destiny worth while. Surely, the canning clubs have 
demonstrated their value to Georgia. 
The adult demonstration work in Georgia is carried on by a State agent 
and six assistant State and district agents. There are sixty-one local agents 
working in seventy-five counties. There were 5,600 demonstrators last year 
and 5,236 co-operators. These agents reached and worked with about 23,336 
persons during the year 1913. The average yield of corn on the 15,000 acres 
under demonstration methods was 36.3 bushels per acre. The average 
yield of cotton on the 18,000 acres where demonstration methods were followed 
was 1,303 pounds of seed cotton per acre. An average yield of forty-three 
bushels of oats was obtained on the 40,550 acres in demonstrations of this 
character. It will be seen that the average yield of the State was more than 
doubled by farmers who carried out the instructions brought to their attention 
through the county agents. No wonder that the business men of the State 
have lent their cordial support an active co-operation to the furtherance of 
work of this character. 
Some of the benefits of demonstration work which may be called to atten- 
tion at this time are the following: An increase of 300 per cent. in the growth 
of legumes by the demonstrators and co-operators; more than 1,000 rotations 
have been instituted by the demonstrators; sixty per cent. of the land on the 
demonstration areas is fall plowed; five per cent. of the demonstrators select 
their seed; fifteen per cent. follow shallow cultivation; seventy-five per cent. 
have terraced their lands; there has been an increase in the use of modern 
machinery of 500 per cent.; and seventy-five per cent. raise their own pork. 
Over 500 pure-bred Percheron horses were introduced into the State, twenty- 
five silos built, and hog cholera preventive serum administered to hundreds 
of hogs last year as a result of.the activities of the local agents. 
These are but incidental facts as illustrating the powerful constructive 
value, which must be accorded the work of a properly organized and main- 
tained college of agriculture and the extension-demonstration service, which 
constitutes a part of its activities. They show that the correlation of the 
various lines of work in Georgia has been a most wholesome and desirable 
thing, and has added efficiency in all directions and made possible a harvest 
of results of the most momentous character.

THE WORK OF RAILROADS FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOP- 
MENT. 
T.C. Powell, Vice-President Southern Railway, A. G. S. R. R. and C. C.N.O. 
«PB. Ry. Cos; 
It gives me a great deal of pleasure to be with you today. 
Six years ago the commission on country life conditions published its report 
and emphasized the necessity of good roads, good water, and better prepara- 
tion of food. 
I speak from experience when I refer to the inconveniences of country life 
and to the improvement which has taken place in the last six years. 
The railroad has been, and still is, one of the greatest factors in this de- 
velopment. 
Taking the item of food alone, the dining car service of the railroads, 
maintained at a high standard, is an education as showing what can be done 
by the proper preparation of food products of the country. 
The work of the railroads is progressive and constantly improving. 
The Southern Railway System, representing a mileage of over 10,000 miles, 
began with a land and industrial department, whose special duty was to 
locate new industries and bring in additional farming population. 
We found that we had reached a point which necessitated a new organiza- 
tion to carry forward the work initiated by the land and industrial department, 
and to do this in an even more personal way. 
For that purpose the agricultural department was formed. 
Conference with the late Dr. 8. A. Knapp, of the United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, resulted in enlisting his sympathy and assistance, Dr. 
Knapp going so far as to authorize the railroad to employ one of his most 
expert men. 
This expert, Mr. W. M. Bamberg, entered into the work zealously and died 
in the service. 
His successor, Mr. T. O. Plunkett, also recommended by Dr. Knapp, 
has carried forward this work, and is now at the head of the department, 
in the support of which the Southern Railway System expends thousands of 
dollars annually for salaries and traveling expenses. 
This department, beginning with only one man and an assistant, is now 
known as the department of farm improvement work, composed of a manager, 
three assistant managers, and thirty-two field agents, who enter personally 
into the farm work all through the Southern territory. 
The success of this department was so manifest that the management 
felt it necessary to organize a department of market agents, to form a medium 
between the producer and the purchaser. 
It was anticipated that under the guidance of the department of farm 
improvement work, there would be products raised in excess of the consuming 
capacity of the immediate neighborhood, and recognizing that the farmer 
would probably require a business education in marketing his products, the 
department of market agents was organized for the purpose of furnishing 
this education in a disinterested and impartial way.
-P-A-G-E-115
  Business MEN’s CONFERENCE 111 
From the very-beginning it was announced that it was not the purpose to 
displace the commission merchant or middle man. 
On the contrary, the market agents posted themselves as to the reliable 
commission merchants in each center, and the producer is thereby offered 
the opportunity of selling his surplus products to a commission merchant 
or to the direct consumer, as he elects. 
The Southern Railway System is also interested in the good roads move- 
ment and operates good roads trains, and also co-operates with the agri- 
cultural colleges in the various States in operating the dairy trains and in 
studying through its live stock experts the live stock and poultry condi- 
tions throughout the Southern territory. 
The public may. ask what benefit the railroad derives from these expen- 
ditures. : 
It is manifest that if a Southern cotton planter ships his cotton to the north 
and with the money so obtained buys his corn, flour and meats in the north, 
that this provides a double revenue for the carrier. 
But the purpose of the railroad management goes far beyond such tem- 
porary conditions. 
Experience has shown us that the farmer who diversifies is the one who 
is most prosperous. 
We find that instead of depending for our revenue upon a few staple articles 
or upon the raw materials, such as coal and stone, we are deriving increased 
revenue from the item “merchandise,” which includes all those articles which 
go into the daily life of all the people. 
While, therefore, we are losing tonnage and revenue on some of the grain 
and meats previously handled, we are deriving as much, and, in some cases, 
more revenue from the various articles going to make up the item ‘“‘mer- 
chandise”’ in the statistics of the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
As I walked through the exhibits in the Armory this morning, I was as- 
tonished at the development which has taken place in the last six or seven 
years. 
The model farm house and the lectures on cooking and domestic science 
all indicate a tremendous step forward in the betterment of conditions not 
only in country homes and farm houses, but also in the communities. 
In the development of community life I am impressed with the example 
of Duesseldorf, Germany, located on the Rhine. 
Before the Franco-Prussian War, Duesseldorf was a small community of 
about 40,000 people, with few manufacturing plants. 
Inspired by the results of the war, Duesseldorf determined to become a 
great manufacturing center. 
The city voted to spend $4,000,000 in developing its harbor facilities and 
it is today a manufacturing community of 350,000 people. 
Following the example of our own city of Washington, the Duesseldorf 
authorities laid out the city far in advance, so that as each business thorough- 
fare and each residential street and place are developed and each public 
square is laid out, they must conform to this pre-arranged plan. 
I think this is a feature which should be considered in the development of 
the south.
-P-A-G-E-116
  112 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
In traveling through the country one cannot fail to notice the disreputable 
appearance of the premises adjacent to the railroad property. 
The railroads are doing much to improve their own property, and this 
feature should be taken in hand by the inhabitants so that the surroundings 
of the small stations in the south will be as attractive as they are in England. 
The extensive cultivation of flowers which is noticeable in England, is the 
result of only about fifty years of effort through organizations such as ours, 
and through prizes given at country fairs and flower shows. 
What we have done is only an earnest of what we can do, and in the pro- 
gressive development of the south, I can assure you that you will have the 
hearty co-operation of the Southern Railway. 
WHAT THE SELMA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAS DONE FOR 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURAL LIFE. 
Morgan Richards, Secretary of Chamber of Commerce, Selma, Ala. 
Prior to the year 1911 the stationery of the Selma Chamber of Commerce 
bore the following statement: 
“Exemption from taxes and license for five years: Free sites and capital 
advanced acceptable new industries.” 
We have changed this along with a change in our policy, and our letters 
heads now show the purpose of the organization, which is ‘To develop the 
resources and advance the interests of Selma and Dallas county, Ala.” 
We have not abandoned the quest for larger industrial payrolls, but have 
decided that the best way to get them was by first developing the surrounding 
country. Acceptable new industries are no longer located by bonuses, but 
sites are selected where local conditions tend to insure their future success. 
Most of our work, therefore, during the past three years, has been devoted 
towards the development of agricultural life. 
We have carried out a number of projects for the good of our country 
neighbors since this new policy was adopted, but before commencing active 
work in any of them, we have enlisted the support of these people them- 
selves. When we began there was a spirit of antagonism between the rural 
districts and the city which was hard to overcome, but by persistent work 
we have exceeded our expectations and there is now a spirit of harmony 
between. the two classes which will result in more lasting good to Selma than 
any other step we could have taken. 
One of our first achievements was good roads. This campaign in Dallas 
county was started by the Chamber of Commerce and in order to enlist 
the aid of the entire county, the Dallas County Good Roads Association was 
organized. The result of this organization was a bond issue of $350,000, 
and a system of highways which is a credit to any community. In a little 
over three years we have expended over $500,000, and out of the 1,100 miles 
of roads in the county, 130 have been graded and graveled and 500 miles 
have been improved to such an extent that they are equal to our best roads 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
Business MEN’s CONFERENCE 113 
of a few years ago. We insisted on permanent improvements and now have 
in our county 110 steel bridges with concrete floors and abutments. About 
one-half of our road work has been done by convict labor and we have one of 
the best convict outfits in the south. 
Probably of greater and more lasting importance is the w ene we have done 
towards systematic farming. Dallas county was one of the first counties 
in Alabama to take advantage of the national and State aid in demonstration 
work. Over four years ago the Chamber of Commerce raised the necessary 
money to get a demonstration agent for this county and we consider it the 
best investment we have ever made. On a trip, which I made over the county 
last week, I saw thousands of acres in oats and clover where two years ago 
the farmers were plowing up cotton stalks during the corresponding week. 
This year we are trying to make the work of the demonstration agent 
more effective, and with this end in view, we have established six demonstra- 
tion farms, each containing twenty acres, and have located them in dif- 
ferent sections of the county, where they will be an object lesson to a great 
number of farmers. We believe that our plan is original or at least has some 
original features, and from the results so far, we can commend it to other 
organizations which may be working on similar lines. 
Our first deviation from the usual rules was in the selection of the com- 
mittee. Our trustees appointed a committee of three with full authority to 
handle their department without suggestions or instructions other than that 
the farms were to be operated for educational purposes alone. One thousand 
dollars was appropriated and turned over to them with which to carry on the 
work. The committee consists of the most progressive farmer in the county, 
the demonstration agent and the secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, 
and they are not hampered by having to make reports or get instructions from 
the parent body. 
This committee contracted with six average farmers to carry on the work 
under the direction of the demonstration agent. These farmers are to plant 
and cultivate the crops according to his instructions, to keep detailed accounts 
of the cost of and returns from each crop, and to show the farm to any farmer 
who is interested. The committee furnishes all the fertilizers, but does not 
participate in the profits. Although the plan has just been put into operation, 
I believe it has already accomplished a great deal of good, for I know of several 
farmers who are at present using our methods on their entire farms. 
I recently visited several of the farms with a representative of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture from Washington, and he was so well pleased with our 
plan that I understand that he has recommended it in several other sections. 
The development of the live stock industry is another of our hobbies. 
After a thorough study of the conditions surrounding this industry we decided 
and we had the opinions of some of the best posted men in the United States 
in this decision, that we had an ideal section for stock raising and that it 
would be more profitable than any other development we have started. In 
line with our usual custom, we have enlisted the country man in this work, 
and recently organized the Black Belt Live Stock Association. This work is 
already bearing fruit, as hardly a day passes that I do not hear of some man 
buying blooded stock or building a silo, while the sale of native heifers, mares 
   
-P-A-G-E-118

and sows has practically stopped. We are using the live stock association 
as a means of bringing the farmers of the surrounding section together every 
three months for a sort of farmers’ institute, where speakers who are well 
posted in crops as.well as live stock are secured to give talks along practical 
lines. 
These county organizations, such as our live stock association and good 
roads association, are fostered by the Chamber of Commerce because we get 
better results than if the. work was actually done by our own organization. 
The fact that I am secretary of eight such subsidiary organizations is sufficient 
evidence that the Chamber of Commerce is really the moving factor and as 
long as I am secretary I hope that the development of agricultural life will 
be one of its principal objects. 
FARMERS’ CO-OPERATION AS IT AFFECTS BUSINESS. 
By Harry Hodgson, Secretary and Treasurer, Empire State Chemical Company, 
Athens, Ga. 
I am invited to discuss the question, ‘Will the Growth of Farmers’ Co- 
operative Associations be Disadvantageous to Business Interests?” 
It has been said that there is a growing apprehension among business men 
that the widespread movement throughout the country to organize co-oper- 
ative associations among farmers would have an injurious effect upon the 
business men who trade with farmers. 
All men in business or commerce deal with the farmer, either directly or 
indirectly, and to get a clear view of the effect of this widespread movement 
on business, we should have a discussion of it from business men in many dif- 
ferent lines. 
As a rule business men will not take the time away from their regular 
work to attend conferences of this sort, and the result is that the views of 
business men on public questions are not often expressed. And when one con- 
sents to write a paper or make a talk on a question of this sort, he can only 
express the views of himself or of those in the same line of business, and this 
is not truly representative of dozens of other lines of business, whose point 
of view he cannot properly represent. 
I will speak to you as briefly as I can from the viewpoint of an independent 
manufacturer of fertilizers whose zone of operation covers a territory of only 
about fifty miles radius in Georgia. My territory is just one corner of that 
great State. My business sometimes seems important to me, especially when 
I realize that the products of our factory go into the hands of more than 
14,000 farmers; but when I remember that I sell only one ton of fertilizer 
to every forty tons sold in my State, I am forced to realize that I am but a 
little minnow in the big mill pond. 
My company has to borrow each year more than $500,000.00 to conduct. 
one-fortieth of the fertilizer trade of Georgia, and what is still harder, has 
to pay back to the banks that same year $500,000.00 plus the interest. This 
makes my problem seem hard at times, if I look only at the big notes that have
-P-A-G-E-119
Bustness MEN’s CONFERENCE 115 
to be met on due date; but it is not nearly so hard when I look at the 14,000 
smaller notes from farmers, who are going to pay the debt when the crop is 
made. 
I do not believe I will be misunderstood when I make these references 
to my own business. I was asked to speak because I am in active business, 
and the point of view of the business man is desired. If I could illustrate 
my viewpoint without personal reference I would prefer to do so, but I don’t 
know how to do it in any other way. 
Now these 14,000 farmers who use the products of our factory, are not 
known to me personally. They buy on credit, and no credit man living could 
pass on the credits of 14,000 farmers, nor on half that number. About 200 
merchants sell to these 14,000 farm and that is an average of seventy far- 
mers to each merchant. One merchant can know the credit of seventy 
farmers, but not 14,000. 
The great movements for co-operation in the past have had as one of their 
foundation stones the cutting out of the middle man, or merchant. Probably 
four out of five men here, who are leaders in this co-operative movement, 
think this is the cardinal principle, and that the only way success can come 
will be by cutting out the merchant, or middle man. 
My thought is that as long as the mercantile business of the south is done 
on credit, the system now in vogue, by which a manufacturer sells to the 
merchant, who in turn passes on the individual credit of the farmer, must 
continue. This should be admitted frankly by those so eager to cut out the 
merchant or dealer as a so-called ‘‘middle man.” If the farmers are going 
to get on a cash basis, and will take their fertilizers by paying sight draft on 
pill of lading, as the merchants do when they buy flour, meat, etc., then we 
will be ready to consider cutting out the merchant, but that time is not here. 
There have been three great movements for co-operation among farmers: 
About forty years ago the Grange; about twenty-five years ago the Farmers’ 
Alliance, and in late years the Farmers’ Union. In our State a few years ago, 
this latter body had as splendid an organization as anyone could wish for, 
with 150,000 members. They had co-operative warehouses in many counties, 
a co-operative fertilizer factory, and other active industries, all of which I be- 
lieve have failed. When there have been three great movements that have risen 
to great influence and then gone out, there must be some fundamental cause 
that is wrong. I believe the reason is that the farmers have had a misconcep- 
tion of conditions, and that it has been a mistake to form these organizations 
on an idea that the business men and bankers were to be classed as enemies 
to the farmer, men who are parasites trying to take away from the farmer 
everything the farmer makes. There may be cases where this is true, but 
such cases are exceptions and not the general rule, and the merchant or banker 
who works on the plan of bleeding the farmer only works to his own ultimate 
injury. 
If a merchant or banker fails to realize that the backbone of his business 
depends upon the real and genuine success and prosperity of the farmer, 
he is indeed near-sighted. Especially is this true under present conditions 
in the south. If the 14,000 farmers I have referred to in this discussion fail 
to make a good crop when we have sold them on credit, the effect on our com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
116 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
pany is deplorable, indeed, as it is on all others engaged in business. I think 
the business men of the south appreciate this fully, and that their self-interest 
—even if their motives were as sordid and selfish as they are sometimes 
represented to be —would cause them to welcome any movement that has 
for its end the benefit and added prosperity to the farmers who feed us all. 
I want to warn the true friends of the farmer and the promoters of this 
last movement for farmer’s co-operation, to get away from the idea that 
they must teach the belief that men in business are the farmers’ natural 
enemies. The leaders of labor have in many cases taught that capital and labor 
were natural enemies, and had no cause in common. The railroads at the 
present time are having to lay off laborers by the thousand because the business 
being done at present rates will not ant the retention of so many em- 
ployes on the payroll. It is easy to say things that arouse prejudice and mis- 
understandings. That man is the true patroit who cultivates the under- ~ 
standings between people rather than the misunderstandings, and the great 
strength of President Wilson is his patience and diplomacy in dealing with 
misunderstandings. 
In Georgia we have several cases where the farmers and bankers are co- 
operating to the profit of both classes. In Tattnall county, Ga., the nine 
banks of the county have formed a co-operative association, which employs 
a farm demonstration agent, partly paid by the Government and partly 
by popular subscription. The bankers recently financed a carload of heavy 
draft mares for breeding purposes, to build up the grade of stock in that county. 
The farmers were not able to pay all cash for these mares, so the banks made 
the loans with proper security. I will read a letter from Moultrie, Ga., 
which shows a kind of co-operation where business men and: farmers are 
joining forces. This is the kind of relation which should be cultivated: 
“MOULTRIE PACKING COMPANY, Moultrie, Ga. 
“March 31, 1914. 
“Mr. Harry Hodgson, Athens, Ga. 
“Dear Mr. Hodgson: 
“Your letter is received today. In reply will say that it has been a habit 
in Georgia since I was a boy to advise the farmers to diversify their crops. 
Everybody offered the advice, but the farmers somehow have declined to 
accept the advice. There is a reason. When I began to study the question, 
I tried to discover that reason. I think I ascertained the truth and our plan 
is the answer to the inquiry—why have the farmers not diversified? My 
opinion is that they have had no market for anything but cotton. 
“The next thing to do was to make markets. The farmer cannot and will 
not do it. The business men must do it. It is easy to get the farmers to raise 
the stuff if the business men will sell it for them. The business men of Moultrie 
decided with me and we set about making these markets. We are building 
a packing house to buy their stock every day in the year. The banks here 
offered to loan them money on hay and grain, or to buy it from them at the 
market price. We organized the truck business and propose to sell everything 
they can raise, as a result of which they have planted nearly 4,000 acres of
-P-A-G-E-121
  
Business MEn’s CONFERENCE 117 
truck for this spring’s delivery. We also organized the farmers and business 
men into a produce federation, which is nothing more than the Moultrie 
Chamber of Commerce working in the country districts, having a vice-presi- 
dent and twelve executive committeemen in each militia district. This 
federation organizes and fosters a truck and stock club wherever the com- 
munity desires it. 
“The plan has done even more than we expected of it thus far. The far- 
mers have become enspirited and enthusiastic over the prospect and they have 
set to work with renewed energy, all alienation between town and country 
has disappeared, the business men have begun to take a keen interest in the 
welfare of the farmers and the town and country have become one in spirit 
and determination. They are working together under the direction of the 
one organization. In the packing house company, with $100,000 capital, 
the farmers have taken $30,000 worth of the stock. 
“J am pleased to give you this information, and shall be glad to assist you 
further in anything I can. 
“Yours very truly, 
“Joun W. Greer, Secretary.” 
Is it not true that the first three attempts at co-operation which failed, 
failed because the farmers tried to fulfil all functions? The business man 
cannot and should not be eliminated from the movement. He has his proper 
function, and should fulfil it. 
If our leaders in the co-operative movement would spend more time and 
effort in doubling our crops the best results would be obtained. The work 
of the Georgia State College of Agriculture is the greatest work for the general 
good that has happened in our State in a generation. The business men, 
and not the farmers, have given the money for the prizes for the boys’ corn 
clubs and girls’ tomato clubs, and about half the money used for the employ- 
ment of county farm demonstration agents. 
In Georgia, business men this year have given $25,000.00 for boys’ corn 
clubs, $8,000.00 for girls’ tomato clubs, and the city of Atlanta has given an 
additional $10,000.00 for the annual corn show—a total of $43,000.00 volun- 
tarily contributed, which supplements an equal amount from the Federal 
Government. Thus from $86,000.00 to $100,000.00 is being spent in my 
State for practical education on the farm through this close and sympathetic 
co-operation. 
This is also true in most of the other southern States, and in States in 
other section of the union. 
In Georgia, though the business men have made such large contributions 
for this form of co-operation, we sometimes find that the farm demonstrators 
themselves, unfortunately, have been the means of exciting the prejudice 
of the farmers against these very business men. This sounds pretty bad, 
and certainly is calculated to arouse wonder and surprise on the part of some 
of the contributors, but it is because the demonstrator has not a full under- 
standing of the fact that the interests of the farmer and merchant are largely 
mutual. Everyone is apt to go wrong sometimes, but I think when men come 
   
-P-A-G-E-122
  118 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
together in an open forum of this sort and strive to understand each other, 
that it can be done. 
At our Conference last year at Richmond there was a very spirited debate, 
one that grew almost acrimonious. because of some unnecessary misunder- 
standings among the speakers. I was disappointed in that discussion. It 
was not entirely conducted on the highest plane. Men who are skilled in 
debate, and who have made hundreds of speeches from the stump, waxed 
eloquent in telling the audience how wicked the business men are and how 
imposed upon the farmers are. 
Business men are very often misrepresented, and not always from malice 
on the part of their detractors either, but because the speaker sees only his 
own point of view. The progress we are looking for and the progress both 
farmer and merchant is entitled to, can come only when the interests of both 
are recognized as mutual, which fundamentally we must admit is true. 
I have left my business one week each year during the busiest season, to 
attend these Conferences of Education in the South, because I feel that 
education is not only the basis of our liberty, but fundamentally it is the basis 
of our prosperity. Our wealth in the south is dependent principally upon 
our agricultural development, and during the past five years it seems to me 
we in Georgia have made wonderful strides in this matter. Alumni of the 
University of Georgia, composed largely of business men, proved their abid- 
ing interest in the farmer when they gave $100,000.00 from their own pockets 
to buy additional land for the college of agriculture, a deed-for which they 
turned over to the State. Every year they are giving of their funds liberally 
to keep this work going. Like bread cast upon the waters, it is coming back 
in increased business, though the business men have never given these dona- 
tions from sordid motives. 
While agricultural progress in Georgia is going forward by leaps and 
bounds, the opportunities for developing our agriculture are so vast that it 
seems we are only scratching the surface. It will be a great mistake to push 
the arguments for co-operation along the old line, which had at its root 
antagonisms between farmer and merchant. We who believe this co-operative 
movement is best for the development of our rural life should cultivate a 
co-operation that draws into the movement the business man as a partner 
and not as an opponent of the farmer. Why were the co-operative cotton 
warehouses built in almost every county in Georgia? The reason was that 
the farmers of the organization desired to save a few dollars by putting the 
warehousemen out of business. There were not evils enough in the business 
of warehousing to justify this. All of those co-operative warehouses failed 
of success and the farmers who put their money into them lost it, to a great 
degree, because of a lack of business experience among that class of citizens. 
This is true of other types of business. Three years ago my company 
bought an oil mill that was owned by a lot of farmers who failed to operate 
it successfully. There have been dozens of oil mills in Georgia founded by 
farmers to cut out business men from operating them, and in practically 
every case they failed. We need special training in business to succeed, and 
we need special training in farming to succeed. Let the shoemaker stick to 
his last. Likewise let our farmers be trained in their own line of work for
-P-A-G-E-123
  Bustness Mén’s CONFERENCE 119 
greatest efficiency. At the same time let them learn to appreciate the re- 
lation of their calling to the community in which they live. Their success 
and happiness will then be assured. 
When farmers organize an industry they put one of their members in charge 
without previous commercial training. It is not unreasonable then that he 
should fail. 
In pleading for rational methods in bringing about better co-operation 
among farmers, I urge that we must not put the cart before the horse. 
Before we undertake too many plans to create co-operative warehouses, etc., 
let us concentrate attention on bigger production at lower cost. A few years 
ago the plan for holding cotton for fifteen cents took up almost the entire 
time of all farmers’ organizations. When cotton reached fifteen cents it 
was found that the cotton mills could not spin it profitably at this cost, 
so the cotton mills closed down. It would have been better if these farmers’ 
organizations had devoted more time to the study of improved farming 
methods so that cotton could have been grown more cheaply, then twelve 
or thirteen would have yielded a satisfactory profit and the mills could have 
continued to spin. Let us not lose sight of the fundamentally right thing to. 
work for. 
In advocating fifteen-cent cotton, the farmer lost sight of everything for 
the time being but what seemed to be his own immediate gain. He did not 
realize how helpless he is without equal prosperity in all lines of the cotton 
industry. Business experience would have taught him that one phase of 
any industry cannot possibly develop at the expense of another. The above 
mistake seems to have been made on account of a lack of experience and 
education, and not on account of any deliberate attempt to injure the general 
prosperity of the cotton mill owners. This is a mistake not uncommon among 
all classes of business men as well as farmers. 
Another side of this question of co-operation, and one which we must not 
lose sight of, is the race question. For instance, in a State like Georgia, eleven- 
twentieths of our population is white and nine-twentieths negroes. We 
cannot strictly apply old world conditions of co-operation to our southern 
States. They haven’t the negro in the equation over there. Our farmers 
have a great problem in getting efficiency from negro tenants. Unless negro 
tenants are self-sustaining through sufficient farming, they bring about 
an actual loss to the land-owner every year. We must concentrate in our 
efforts to urge better farming methods as the first big duty of this Con- 
ference. When we have production like they have in Denmark, we can prob- 
ably market. these products similarly; but I submit that the first line to 
press, with our own co-operative zeal, is the work of our colleges of agri- 
culture, experiment stations and demonstration farms, to bring about a pro- 
duction of crops in keeping with our soil and climatic advantages. 
Georgia does not yet raise its own foodstuff, though our progress has been 
marked along this line. Georgia still brings in from other States 25,000,000 
bushels of corn annually. Do the merchants who sell this corn to farmers 
object to giving up this trade in corn if the farmer will grow it at home? By 
no means. They are glad to give it up and constantly and persistently 
advise their farmer customers to grow all the feeds and foodstuff that they 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  
  120 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
consume. They know that this is the only way a farmer can be successful 
and able to pay up his debts. The merchant knows that only with a prosperous 
line of farmer customers can he make money himself. 
I have endeavored in this discussion to show that co-operation which isolates 
the farmer and antagonizes other lines of business, results in harm to all 
parties. Not only does it fail to benefit the farmer, but it works to his in- 
jury and to the injury of all other lines of business, while on the other hand 
co-operation among farmers which recognizes that farming is but a part of 
the business of society, is the wise and normal co-operation which produces 
prosperity and through which the farmer reaps the greatest reward. 
  WILL THE RURAL CO-OPERATIVE MOVEMENT CONFLICT WITH 
PRESENT BUSINESS INTERESTS? 
John Lee Coulter, Ph. D., George Peabody College, Nashville, Tenn. 
In addressing a body of business men, including some farmers, on the sub- 
ject before me today, I feel it my duty first to state that my whole training 
and experience lines me up on the side of business men generally. By this 
I mean only business men who carry on a just, equitable, and necessary busi- 
ness. I have no fellow-feeling for business men who are conducting kinds of 
business which I think unnecessary and frequently even hurtful to society. 
Likewise, I have no sympathy for business men who, in their business, do 
things injurious to society as a whole, or to individual members of society. 
Unless, therefore, any line of business, or any business enterprise is carried 
on honestly and in justice to the buyer as well as the seller and to the seller 
as well as the buyer, I oppose it, try to secure legislation to regulate it, will 
expose the wrong at every opportunity, and seek to influence people not to 
patronize it or suffer it to continue. Taking this position, it seems to me to 
be reasonable to approach the subject assigned to me with an open mind, 
and answer it deliberately. Indeed, I have done this for the past five years. 
I have considered it at great length, and with great care, and am free to an- 
nounce my decision at the opening of my argument. My position is, stated 
in a sentence, I believe that the rural co-operative movement will not conflict 
with and injure any legitimate business in the country, or if it does conflict 
with any legitimate business, it will succeed only if it can be done better in 
the new way. In this event it should be advocated and approved by all 
right-thinking people, since, if it is a better way to do business, if it is more 
economical, it should be advocated and introduced whenever and wherever 
possible. I shall now proceed to examine the question more or less in detail, 
and give the reasons for coming to my conclusions. 
Farmers are advised to co-operate and indeed to form definite organiza- 
tions to take up questions of seed selection, breeding and planting. It is 
urged that as a result, the yield can be largely increased. Where tried, this 
has proved effective. Production has increased, and efficiency has greatly 
developed. I ask the question now, what business could legitimately object
-P-A-G-E-125
  Business MEN’s CONFERENCE 121 
to this type of co-operation? I answer the question myself by saying, that 
only one type of business man could object, and this type would be the seed 
dealer who has in the past gotten rich selling poor seeds. He is the dealer 
who has purchased poor seeds at a low price and sold them at a high price to 
poor farmers. He should be driven out of business, and right-thinking 
seed dealers should help. But another change might take place. If farmers 
should form such a co-operative organization they doubtless would wish 
to buy their seed in considerable quantities, and possibly would wish to place 
an order for enough seed to supply the entire membership. The farmers 
would now be responsible for dividing the large quantity of seeds into small 
orders, and dividing the same among farmers. The organization would be 
responsible for the entire transaction. I would advise farmers to do this 
very thing. But I would insist, at the same time, that they should form a 
good business unit, and either give the collective note of the unit for the 
seeds, or else pay cash. If I take this position, surely seed men cannot object, 
since they have a responsible organization to sell to, and receive in payment 
either cash or good paper. But, at the same time, those who sell in such large 
quantities should be willing to sell large quantities at large quantity prices— 
that is, the same as wholesale prices instead of retail prices. I believe that 
any such farmers’ organization should be thoroughly competent to divide 
the large order into small lots and distribute the same among the farmers. 
In this way they would save a considerable amount to be used for other pur- 
poses. It would seem here that the retail seed men might be injured to some 
extent, but since this is a side business generally, and comparatively an unim- 
portant part of the business of those who sell the seeds, there should be com- 
paratively little objection on the part of the seed men; and there should be 
hearty approval of this change on the part of all good citizens who desire 
to see the farmers prosper, produce more and better crops, and lead better 
lives. I believe this is an illustration of introducing an improved form, or 
a more efficient form, of conducting business. 
Turning attention now to the live stock side of farming, farmers are ad- 
vised to form themselves into clubs, or small business organizations, to buy, 
own, and manage breeding stock such as bulls, stallions, jacks, boars, rams, 
and other breeding animals. This advice is based upon a knowledge of the 
fact that individual farmers, taking the country as a whole and eliminating a 
few large ones, cannot afford to maintain high-priced, pedigreed, valuable 
stock of this kind. On the other hand, it is a thoroughly established fact 
that without these selected animals the live stock industry cannot be brought 
to a high point of development or perfection. Here we advise a specific 
step, and a specific type of live stock co-operative society. Surely business 
men should not object to this, since it means larger, finer, better live stock 
in the country. Business men in town should be able, as a result, to purchase 
horses and mules for their needs, and get not only better animals, but get 
them at better prices. Consumers generally should approve of this movement, 
since it means bigger, better, cheaper meat supply for the country. Bankers 
who would be called on to finance such transactions should be greatly pleased, 
since they would either secure the collective note of the whole group of farmers,
-P-A-G-E-126
    
122 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
or handle the cash. Certainly those who have some animals for sale should 
approve it, since this would give them a much more satisfactory market. 
Let us go one step farther here, and see what further co-operation is urged 
on farmers by students of co-operation, and by organizers among the farmers 
themselves. Dairy farmers are advised to form cow-testing associations. 
Now the business of these associations, in a word, is to test each cow in 
the herd both for quantity of milk produced during the year, and for quality 
. of milk produced during the year, by ascertaining the amount of butter fat 
in the milk. The purpose is to find out what cows are poor producers, and 
which ones are good producers. In most herds some cows are lazy, or are 
boarders, and should not be kept. The other cows produce not only milk 
sufficient to net a good profit, but also produce enough to make up for the 
sacrifice or loss due to the lazy cows. It is believed that in a period of fifteen 
or twenty years, if all farmers would do this, the yield per cow for the whole 
United States would be practically doubled—merely by weeding out the lazy 
cows, and keeping and developing only the industrious cows. I cannot imagine 
any business man objecting to this. Cow-testing associations are now being 
formed, and should be urged wherever dairy cows are found. The association 
should employ regular cow testers who would go about from farm to farm 
testing cows, and helping the farmers to improve their system. 
But out of the cow-testing association is likely to develop a buying organiza- 
tion. The farmers are accustomed to work together, they are acquainted 
with each other, and their needs are very much the same. For instance, they 
may wish to buy cream separators, and various other paraphernalia which 
goes with the dairy business. But if they can agree upon an order of goods 
and have an efficient organization ready to buy a considerable quantity, 
and are organized in such a way that they may be held responsible for either 
cash payments or satisfactory notes, why should any business object? Here, 
however, certain retail merchants may find a slight loss in business. If, 
on the other hand, a more efficient organization results, I must confess that 
I am ready to advocate the change. I would not, however, advocate any 
change from the present arrangement unless this group of farmers should 
organize themselves into a thoroughly business-like society, responsible for 
all of its acts, and ready to do business in a business-like way. If, under this 
arrangement, the farmers could buy a considerable quantity of any article, 
they should not only receive the proper discount for paying cash, but should 
receive the proper discount for buying a wholesale quantity instead of in the 
retail way. 
Let us go one step farther and see just how this movement is likely to work 
out. These dairy farmers produce milk as their primary product. This 
milk must either be sold to the consumers in the cities in the fresh form, or 
it must be made into cheese and butter. If sold to the city consumers in the 
fresh form, the city consumers must of necessity put up with the present 
unorganized system. As many as five or ten milk men pass my house each 
day. They wake up my small baby at 5 o’clock in the morning; they are 
unable to have the proper equipment in delivery wagons. There is an immense 
waste as the result of their present system. I would propose as a substitute, 
that a group of farmers furnishing the same city should form themselves into
-P-A-G-E-127
  Bustness MEN’s CONFERENCE 123 
a business organization to sell milk. They produce this milk, and they must 
sell it. Let them establish one milk depot—with branches, if the number 
of farmers is large enough, and the city is large enough. All milk should be 
delivered to this station, and one set of delivery wagons should distribute 
the milk to the consumers. In this way an immense saving would result. 
Farmers could afford to sell to the consumers at a considerably lower price 
than they do now, and at the same time could make more money themselves 
by an efficient organization of this kind. Not only would farmers make more 
and consumers pay less, but a better product and more efficient service could 
be guaranteed. But farmers do not wish to sell all of their milk directly to 
city consumers. Hundreds of thousands of farmers produce milk to sell 
in the form of butter and cheese. After years of study, I am convinced that 
milk and cream should not be shipped great distances to large factories, 
because by the time it reaches the factory it is not of as good quality as when 
it left the farm. The big factory has no charm by which it can convert 
deteriorated raw material into a high-quality finished product. In other words, 
this raw material tends to deteriorate on its way to the factory. On the other 
hand, I am convinced that the individual farmer, particularly the small 
farmer, cannot make butter and cheese as economically as can the factory. 
Further than this, they cannot make as uniform a product, or as good a 
product as can the factory. Further than this they have no efficient way to 
market their products. Now, I maintain that the farmers must either produce 
the butter and cheese on their own farms and then organize a farmers’ society 
to look after the selling of the product, or if there are enough cows, and enough 
milk and cream produced, they should organize a small community creamery 
or cheese factory to make the butter and cheese and look after the selling of 
the product. Only two classes of business men could possibly take exception 
to this scheme: the man who plans to have a:great centralizer, and wishes to 
buy the milk or cream from the farmers in order that he may make the butter 
and cheese and accumulate a fortune for himself—naturally he would oppose 
the co-operative scheme. On the other hand, we must consider the con- 
sumers who wish a uniform and a good product at as cheap a price as possible, 
and I am convinced that the small local factory will bring this much more 
surely than the big factory. The only other person to object would be the 
small storekeepers, who buy the butter from the individual farmers. They 
may get two advantages from this inefficient and primitive system where 
it still exists. They may buy the butter or cheese at a very low price and 
sell it at a higher price, and thus make a profit in carrying on the business; 
or they may actually not make any profit out of the business itself, but they 
may wish to continue it in order to get the farmer’s trade. Now, it is un- 
reasonable, in the first place, to ask the farmers to turn their business over 
to the local merchants if by doing so they are going to lose financially, and 
clearly the farmers should organize themselves into an efficient marketing 
society to dispose of their butter, unless they have creameries and cheese 
factories. If these merchants wish the farmers’ trade, they should make their 
stores sufficiently attractive, and their prices satisfactory to merit it. Cer- 
tainly the farmers must patronize some store, and if they secure better prices 
for their farm products they will even be able to purchase more than under

the present system, thus redounding to the benefit of the merchant. Many 
pages might be written on this subject, and entire addresses given. But I 
shall have to leave much unsaid, and conclude that I cannot think of any 
reason for conflict between the movement looking toward co-operative cream- 
eries and cheese factories, or co-operative organizations to sell the milk, butter, 
and cheese, where creameries and cheese factories would not be profitable. 
The butter and cheese must still be shipped from one place to another, 
must still be held in storage, and must stilt be sold to the consumer. 
But let me return to the other side of the live stock industry. Farmers 
produce meat animals for the market. To some extent, these animals are 
slaughtered in local butcher shops and abattoirs; to some extent in com- 
paratively small slaughtering and packing establishments, but to a very large 
extent in very great central factories. At the present time there is great in- 
efficiency. Business men, at least large numbers of them, may immediately 
say, we have now reached the point where conflict cannot be avoided. But 
let us see. The first evidence of great inefficiency comes in assembling the 
animals from the farms, and bringing them to the slaughtering establish- 
ments, wherever they may be. This must necessarily be so, since when we 
consider the millions of farmers we must remember that the average farmer 
does not produce enough animals of the same general type, size, color, etc., 
to make up, let us say, a carload, and certainly not a trainload. Now of 
course, it is extremely wasteful and inefficient to put a few hogs in a car 
with other material that is being shipped. In fact this is practically unthink- 
able. The hogs must be fed, watered, etc. If shipped any distance the loss 
in weight would be such an important item that it would be unfortunate to 
allow such sacrifices. The same thing is true in the case of other live animals. 
Slaughtering on the farm itself, except in exceptional circumstances, is equally 
unsatisfactory, since important parts of the animal are entirely lost, and the 
parts sent to market are likely to depreciate somewhat in value. Clearly the 
proper method of sending animals to their doom is in carload lots, unless 
local institutions are to be patronized. Here the proper arrangement seems 
to be for a group of farmers to form a live-stock shipping association. But 
I would urge that this be a thoroughly responsible, business-like organiza- 
tion, so that transportation companies and others might deal with the organ- 
ization in a business-like way. Here comes a definite conflict. At the present 
time, in different parts of the country, there are independent buyers, or rep- 
resentatives of the great central organizations. These buyers go about among 
the farmers, and secure from them their animals. The farmer is not advised 
as to prices at terminal points; he does not keep in touch with the market; 
he does not know the type of animal wanted by the market; he does not know 
the time of year when animals could be marketed to the best advantage. 
He merely raises animals and sells them when buyers come by. This is not 
only unsystematic, uneconomical, and breeds inefficiency, but it is a system 
which lends itself to exploitation. I do not mean by this that all such travel-- 
ing buyers deal unfairly with all farmers, but the system encourages this, 
and some buyers are bound to take advantage of it. I, however, condemn 
the system because of its inefficiency and uneconomical characteristics. 
Thousands of buyers could be dispensed with, and society would save as a
-P-A-G-E-129
  
Business MEN’s CONFERENCE 125 
result. I favor this change in method for the same reason that I would favor 
the invention of the cotton gin or the harvester or the gasoline engine or any 
other improvements, either in our mechanical equipment or in business 
methods. There is no doubt but what some buyers would be displaced. 
But I maintain that they should be. Of course, all would not be displaced. 
Farmers’ shipping societies would have to employ trained men to handle 
live stock. The more efficient would here find thoroughly satisfactory em- 
ployment under a much more efficient system. Under this system only car- 
load lots would be shipped. In each case the car might contain animals 
furnished by one farmer, or by 100 farmers. In each case the car would very 
likely be filled with one type of animal. A car would seldom, if ever, be 
shipped loaded with a conglomeration of cows, chickens, rams, etc. A car 
would have, let us say, all black hogs, weighing an average of 200 pounds, 
and no individual animal falling below 180, and none running over 220. 
This carload would bring the top price. The same would be true of a carload 
of baby beeves, of lambs, etc. This, I believe, is the first step towards an 
efficient system. I would have thé farmers go only through the various 
stages where inefficiency is found at the present time. If, at the present 
time, hogs were shipped several hundred miles, and there converted into 
becon, and then re-shipped into the same neighborhood from which they 
came, I would certainly advocate a saving in the shipping, in the handling, 
in the loss of weight, ete. And this would mean the establishment of a bacon 
factory patronized by several hundred farmers. It is a waste of time in this 
generation to discuss the ownership of great packing establishments by others 
than those who have developed the system. If, in another generation, the 
laborers employed about such factories take over the ownership, or the 
farmers who sell the animals take over the ownership, or if the ownership 
is widely diffused among great numbers of people, or if the buyer of meats, 
or the retail stores, or if indeed, the Government take over the packing plant, 
that is a problem for the next generation, and not for this. I must confess 
myself unable to make any recommendations. At the present time I think 
it proper that there be Government inspection and thorough supervision. 
Time does not permit me to go into all phases of the subject: What I 
have said with reference to the dairying industry, and the meat-packing 
industry, I would say with reference to the fruit industry, the vegetable 
industry, the grain and hay business, the tobacco, the cotton, the cane. It 
is only a matter of working out details. In many places men engaged in some 
lines of work will find it necessary to change. So does the saloonkeeper and 
the brewery operator, when a new law is passed; so does the. hackmen when 
the street-car system is established; so does the teamster when the automobile 
is introduced. And so, throughout our industrial life, a few men must always 
give way if they are not doing business in an efficient way, or if their business 
is not necessary. 
In conclusion, I must say that it seems to me that there is less conflict 
between the new co-operative movement which is developing and the present 
activities of business men than there is between business men themselves. 
Business men should be as thoroughly in favor of the new movement as they 
are in favor of a new invention, a new discovery, or improved methods in 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
    
126 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
their own business. They should contribute liberally to any movement 
which looks to the improvement of agricultural conditions, and which will 
result in greater efficiency, greater development, greater progress among the 
farmers. The co-operative society is merely a type of organization. It is 
the type best adapted to the needs of the farmer. The new education move- 
ments must take up the co-operation movement, and give it the same atten- 
tion that it has given to scientific agriculture in the past; and business men 
must, I believe, prepare themselves to lend their aid. 
I believe that business men should not only not oppose the movement 
for co-operation, but they should: favor it, for three very definite reasons: 
The first of these reasons is, it will result in a greater production and make 
available more food, clothing, beverage, and other farm materials for the 
consuming population of the cities. Second, they should favor the movement 
because it will result in a happier, more prosperous, and better educated 
country population. Third, they should approve of it for the purely selfish 
reason that it is to their interest to do so. If farmers are prosperous they will 
wear more and better clothes, build more and better houses, and furnish 
them with all of the modern conveniences. They will buy more things from 
the merchants of the present day, and pay for them more nearly on time— 
and all of this will result in better times for the business man. Even the 
laundryman, the teacher, the preacher, the lawyer, the doctor, should favor 
the movement, because of the added prosperity which it would bring to the 
country folks. The biggest purpose of the movement is to eliminate waste, 
to substitute efficiency for inefficiency, and to bring to the farmer his just 
share in the distribution of wealth. 
CO-OPERATION AMONG FARMERS AND BUSINESS MEN. 
R. J. H. DeLoach, Director of the Georgia Experiment Station, Experiment, Ga. 
The question that first suggested itself to me, is, Co-operation Among 
Farmers and Business Men, but, as I have gone forward into the subject, 
it has presented itself to me in the light of “co-operation.’”” Many business 
men are farmers and some farmers are business men. The word “co-operation” 
should signify no more to one class of citizens than it should to another. In 
a large measure our merchants and so-called business men are co-operative 
agents in their respective communities, because of their superior business 
ability. They have been promoted, or demoted, as you may choose, by 
their ability to handle money and accounts for the community. The estimate 
I have placed on such agents as a population which is based on a study of 
three counties, is twenty to one if the merchants of the towns are included, 
and about thirty to one if only the country merchants are included. These 
agents, therefore, could impose a tax of about $100.00 per capital on the popu- 
lation they represent and make a net dividend of $2,000.00 to $3,000.00, 
on the average. This is what they actually do, while some merchants clear 
far more than this and some far less, depending on their relative business 
ability. This tax is made by selling goods at a small per cent. above the original 
cost, and by paying a lower price for produce than it sells for-
-P-A-G-E-131
  Business MEN’s CONFERENCE 127 
Social institutions, such as colleges and experiment stations, as well as 
public schools, are a matter of growth and evolution; they fit into the social 
structure of the communities they are designed to serve. By them the weak 
points in our social life are made strong and the strong ones made stronger. 
Formerly they were concerned only about our moral and spiritual lives; 
now they are beginning to turn their attention to the material welfare of the 
nation. 
In the common schools all classes of citizens are on an equality. In the 
higher forms of education, we seem to take it for granted that certain classes 
of citizens need or deserve special training, and we fit institutions to such 
needs. In fact, the nation as a whole, has in recent years looked as much 
to its source of supply, as to the welfare of the citizens furnishing the supplies, 
and there has been created national and State institutions to help teach us 
how to increase our supplies. 
The agricultural colleges and experiment stations are designed to help feed 
the nation, regardless of the citizens that are served by them. However, 
it cannot be denied that they are proving a great stimulus to the whole 
people. 
We do not have a great many colleges and stations of commerce. This is 
perhaps true, because the class of citizens represented in this field of endeavor 
have made a success or a great measure of success, and, too, the nation does 
not recognize in:them a source of supplies, and, therefore, does not previde 
for them in the same sense it does for agriculture. This, to me, is an argument 
that the class of citizens on whom we depend for supplies, has been too little 
concerned about its own welfare, as well as the welfare of the nation, and the 
nation has wisely exercised a more or less selfish policy in fostering agricul- 
tural institutions. Agricultural colleges have not been demanded by the classes 
they serve. Therefore, since their need has first been seen by the body 
politic, they are public or State and national Institutions. Recently State 
universities have added departments of commerce, but have not set aside 
large appropriations for them as they have for agriculture. 
Tue Piace AND ImporTANcE OF THE MERCHANT. 
The merchant represents nothing more and nothing less than an agency 
for a certain number of citizens, and he is a substitute for what is termed in 
many places, a “business agent.’ He takes the place of, or better represents, 
certain forms of co-operation and has developed business ability. Through 
years of experience he has learned to handle money, and is trusted by those 
with whom he comes in contact. He is, in reality, the center of trade of his 
community, into whose care produce is entrusted and from whom supplies 
are furnished to the community. Competition in recent years has made it 
almost impossible for him to swindle his constituency, besides, his experience 
has taught him, that honesty wins in the long run. Not all merchants are 
honest, perhaps, but as a rule, they have learned that it pays not to be dis- 
honest. In fact, honesty is largely a matter of experience, as well as an ab- 
stract moral law as we are sometimes taught. 
The business men and merchants are, therefore, a part of our system as
-P-A-G-E-132
128 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
a whole, and must play an important part in any system of co-operation. They 
are best suited by experience to act as financial agents for our great volume 
of trade, or the responsibility would never have fallen upon them. 
It is said that the ability to save and handle money is a gift. It may be 
a gift, but it seems to me that it is a matter of experience as well. In either 
case, the business men have established their ability, and when American 
farmers can establish equal business ability, they will, no doubt, be business 
men. But whether the number of business men is increased or diminished, 
the cost of handling goods and money will always remain the same. That is, 
if it costs only six cents per dozen to raise oranges in Florida or California, 
while the consumer pays thirty cents per dozen, the cost of transportation, 
handling and loss by decay, will remain in the neighborhood of twenty-four 
cents. What does the consumer care about who receives thirty cents per 
dozen for oranges, so he gets the class of goods he desires? If the farmer will 
assume the responsibility of placing oranges into the homes of the consumer, 
he will get thirty cents per dozen, if thirty cents happens to be the standard 
price, but it will cost him twenty-four cents per dozen for transportation, 
handling and loss by decay, allowing a reasonable per cent. on the invest- 
ment. : 
My interest is with the farmer, and I hope to aid him in his problems, by 
helping him to solve the problem of cheaper production of better goods; 
by giving him the key to successful living at home, and, thereby, raising 
such marketable crops as he desires, and demanding prices in proportion to 
their real value. Farmers and business men, alike, make money, but it 
takes a peculiar type of genius to successfully handle it, and in the southern 
States, those agents selected by farmers from their own ranks for financing 
co-operative societies and organizations, have almost invariably failed. 
ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE PossIBILITIES OF CO-OPERATION. 
The question of co-operation is taking a most interesting turn in our 
present day life. Organizations and corporations of extremely different spheres 
of activities are combining forces to strengthen the work in a most effective 
way. For instance, our national and State institutions are getting closer 
together, and are, themselves, enlisting the sympathies of corporations and 
commercial bodies in the work of co-operation. 
In the State of Georgia, the college of agriculture in co-operation with the 
United States Department of Agriculture, are combining forces with chambers 
of commerce, boards of trade, bankers’ associations, and all kinds of organ- 
izations, for the purpose of saving the soil and inspiring the tiller of the soil 
to a new form of Agriculture. In Muscatine county, Iowa, we find the farm 
management work co-operating with other divisions of the United States 
Department of Agriculture, the Iowa State College of Agriculture, Muscatine 
County Crop-Improvement Association, and the business men and banks, 
the railroads and manufacturers. I need not go further into details in reference 
to this co-operation, except to say that the only issue in all of it is to save 
the fertility of the soil and increase our supplies of food and clothing. Every- 
body wishes the farmer greater prosperity, but along with his prosperity 
must come more food and clothing for the whole of humanity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  Business MEN’s CONFERENCE 129 
In it all we recognize selfishness, as well as philanthropy, but whether the 
farmer shall prove equal to the task of going forward without the help and 
guiding hand of other agencies, is a question about which there can be little 
doubt, especially here in the southern States, at the present time. The fact 
that he so often fails is sufficient argument that he is not yet prepared to 
assume such responsibility. 
How Co-oprration AMoNG Farmers Can BE Errecren. 
Agriculture is receiving more attention than all other vocations com- 
bined, because it pays everybody to foster agriculture. In Georgia the far- 
mers pay into the State treasury about $800,000.00, while $1,750,000.00, 
goes back directly into the farm homes and farm communities. 
The business men of the State contribute $3,800,000.00 into the State 
treasury, and draw back directly only about $1,750,000.00. From this ledger, 
it would seem that the business world bears an undue proportion of the bur- 
den of taxation, but all business interests recognize the value of fostering and 
encouraging husbandry, and are, at the present time, helping in many ways 
to elevate the standard and ideals of farm life. In addition to the above 
investment in the form of tax money, the merchants of the State are giving 
over $40,000.00 annually to teach and develop agriculture, while the farmers 
give nothing at all, as has been stated here this afternoon by a former speaker. 
Business men and farmers in all countries represent a vital form of co- 
operation, whether they consider. it so or not. Both classes are necessary 
to the best interests of society as a whole, or society would have expressed. 
itself in some other way. 
Chambers of commerce once organized for the purpose of getting reduced 
freight rates, and for fixing uniform prices on merchandise, have lately turned 
their attention to the question of agriculture, because agriculture is the 
one great source of human food and clothing. But is this the only reason? 
I dare say, no. Generally, business men and our best farmers, see that poor 
farming is costly in the extreme. It not only keeps the farmer in poverty, 
but as truly deprives future generations of’ a normally-fertile soil. Will 
society tolerate this condition indefinitely? As time goes on, there will be 
more people to feed and clothe, and there will be at the present rate, less fer- 
tile soil on which to grow the supplies. We may ask the question then: ‘To 
what extent does an individual own a piece of land?” or ‘Will society continue, 
without protest, to permit individuals to deprive the soil of its normal fer- 
tility?” Iam prepared to believe that this great movement for co-operation 
among all the active agencies in our social life is leading in the direction of 
some form of qualification for land-ownership. The individual who shall 
not be able in the future to hand down to the succeeding generation, farm 
land in as fertile condition as he finds it, will be deprived of the right of owner- 
ship. Why has society remained silent for these many years and seen our 
fertile soils wash away, when they could have been saved to all generations 
to come. This question is now beginning to alarm all of us, and what wonder 
the Federal Government, the various States and all other agencies in our 
entire social structure are giving money and every other form of support 
to save the soil. If these agencies fail to change our system of agriculture,
-P-A-G-E-134
  130 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
if voluntary co-operation fails to save the fertility of the soil, then I am 
prepared to believe that society will enforce certain qualifications for land- 
ownership, for the soil belongs to society. Individuals come and go; they 
are here today only to die tomorrow; and it is possible to deprive soil of fer- 
tility in one generation that it would require five or six generations to regain. 
Society is truly dependent on the soil for future supplies and may look with 
jealousy on any practice that tends to lessen those supplies as the population 
of the world increases, and I am convinced that any form of co-operation 
among farmers, who do not realize the value of soil fertility, will fail, if such 
co-operation has any tendency to eliminate any factor that is thoroughly 
alive to the meaning of soil fertility and methods of conservation. 
A CO-OPERATIVE PLAN TO PROVIDE 5% MONEY FOR FARMERS. 
Lanp Morrcace Crepir Associations AND Co-operATIVE Loca Assocta- 
TIONS FEDERATED INTO Co-oprraTive Stare CEenTraL Assocta- 
TIONS. 
By John Sprunt Hill, of Durham, N. C., a member of the American Commission. 
At the close of my recent argument at Washington, before the joint sub- 
committee of the Senate and House, the distinguished secretary of this 
Conference modestly invited me to participate here today in the discussion 
on “The Land Mortgage Credit Association.’’ Maybe he was so impressed 
with the greatness of my ignorance on this subject that he proposed to give 
me an opportunity of learning something aboutit. Maybe, when hisresource- 
ful mind grappled the subject “What is the Best Means of Financing the 
Farmer for Long-Term Credit,”’ he was reminded of that familiar line of the 
poet: ‘For fools rush in where angels fear to tread,” and immediately 
he thought of his impetuous young friend from North Carolina, as the only 
man rash enough to take a chance at answering this momentous question. 
For many years I have been engaged in the land mortgage business, and 
for many years I have endeavored to supply the man on the ground with 
money at six per cent. without usury, extortion or oppression. I have, there- 
fore, had much opportunity for learning from daily experience something about 
the business, and I thought that I did know something about it until I began 
to learn what other people in other parts of the world and in other parts of 
this country knew about the business, and I was reminded of the words of 
the Prophet, “Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed, lest he fall.” 
The more that I think of the business—so involved with its thousands of in- 
tricacies, and difficulties—the more I am convinced that those senators and 
members of the House of Representatives, who are especially charged with 
the duty of framing appropriate and adequate legislation for financing the 
farmer for long-term credit, have a tremendous responsibility upon their
-P-A-G-E-135
    
      
     Business MEN’s CONFERENCE 131 
shoulders, a task as great or even greater than that of drafting the new bank- 
ing and currency act. The question of mobilizing the resources of commercial 
banks had been publicly discussed by many of the best minds of this country, 
almost continuously for fifteen years before the present Congress undertook 
to frame the law. During all this period of years the average citizen had a 
chance to consider the proposition, to live down his prejudices and to become 
prepared for the radical changes instituted by the law. 
But the general public has not been favored with any long period of prep- 
aration for the enactment of legislation providing for the mobilization of the 
securities of the farmers of this vast country so as to market them on favor- 
able terms with investors. 
The mobilization of land mortgages is almost an entire new field for financial 
thought. In order to secure the relief desired by the farmers of this country, 
we may be suddenly called upon to turn our backs upon some of the pre- 
cedents, the prejudices, and the practices of our fathers. The average citizen 
does not swallow co-operation in a minute, nor a day, nor a month. It is 
necessity that drives men to co-operation. It is the necessity of the farmer de- 
sirous of obtaining money on good security, without oppression. It is the 
necessity of the law-maker, whose mind has discarded all other methods as 
worthless, that forces him to pin his faith to the great economic principle of 
co-operation—in the words of the Recess Committee of Parliament—‘“‘The 
greatest economic wonder since the discovery of steam.” We have passed. 
the exploitation period in this country. Self help and human welfare will be 
the slogans of the future. But for the present, five per cent. money to farmers 
for a long time and on easy payments means radical economic change in our 
country, and the man who undertakes to lead the way to this blessed goal, 
has a fight on his hands. Like the crusader of old, he is engaged in a holy 
war upon the daily business of countless thousands in high places, and like- 
wise upon the daily occupation of countless thousands of “blood suckers” 
in low places. 
FLexiBiity. 
But in a country of vast areas, composed of forty-eight States, several of 
them larger than the entire area of Germany, where the land mortgage busi- 
ness has been so highly developed, it is going to be difficult to devise any land 
mortgage system that will exactly fit the needs of every section. In the 
United States we have all kinds of widely differing conditions. There is very 
great diversity of climate, of products, of methods of business, of develop- 
ment. In States like Iowa and Indiana, where practically all the land is 
fertile and dependable and worth from $100 to $300 per acre, money in reason- 
able quantities is already available for farm loans for short terms of years. 
While in States like Texas and North Carolina, there are many millions of 
farm lands lying idle that can be purchased from $5 to $15 per acre, and money 
for development can only be secured at rates ranging from eight to twenty 
per cent. It is respectfully submitted, therefore, without further argument, 
that any great national institution for transacting the land mortgage business 
with its great book of fixed rules and miles and miles of red tape and its 
thousands and thousands of Federal employees would not fit the needs of 
    
-P-A-G-E-136
       
    132 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
this great diversified country. It would be doomed to failure from the start. 
I will not take up your time discussing it. 
Tue Srate is A Proper Univ. 
Assuming, therefore, the United States is too large a unit for the issuance 
of bonds on aggregated land mortgages, the question arises: Is the State a 
proper unit? Upon raising this question, the average citizen of the middle 
west raises an objection. He has noticed that the issues of township bonds 
bearing four and one-half per cent. interest for road purposes and for drain- 
age purposes have frequently been sold without difficulty or expense to local 
farmers and local business men and local institutions. He has noticed that 
a local building and loan association is doing a thriving business, lending hun- 
dreds of thousands of dollars at six per cent. on the security of farm land, and 
yet the treasury of the local co-operative society is overflowing with deposits. 
He has noticed that there is practically no waste land in the community, 
and no land at all for sale for less than $200 per acre. He has noticed far- 
mers coming into town in automobiles to attend stockholders meetings of the 
local commercial banks. Hence he reasons that the whole farm land mort- 
gage business can be handled by the local village institution, provided he 
have a little further legislation safeguarding the amortization payments and 
facilitating the issuance of trust bonds against the aggregated land mort- 
gages, and insuring independent governmental appraisement. Right away 
this good, fair-minded citizen sees merit in such a bill as the MOSS- 
FLETCHER BILL that provides for the formation of great numbers of little 
competitive mortgage banks, with capital as low as $100,000. 
(a) Organized for profit. 
(b) Owned and operated by money lenders. 
(c) Devoid of altruistic principles. 
He reasons by analogy, the bonds of the township are snapped up by local 
investors and so would local investors buy the $150,000 and more of bonds 
issued by the little local joint stock land mortgage bank. He fails to bear 
in mind the essential fact that the little township bond has the entire com- 
munity and the taxing power, and all the property of the township behind it, 
and is an entirely different kind of a security from the bond of the little 
land mortgage bank. He does not bear in mind the almost certain fact that 
if the little land mortgage bank in another section of his State issued its 
bonds and did not find ready purchasers at home, that they would be hawked 
around money centres for weeks and weeks without being able to find any 
market at all for them. He fails to bear in mind the essential fact that the 
whole system of so-called local competitive land mortgage banks would not be 
any stronger than anyone of these little units. If a single little land mort- 
gage bank at Ramskat in-a particular county in Indiana should issue $150,000 
of these bonds, and by reason of a great flood from the Ohio River, that 
particular community of Ramskat was unable to meet the interest on the 
mortgages immediately, the usurers and money-sharks would fill the news- 
papers with stories of the collapse of the Ramskat land mortgage bank and 
the whole structure of land mortgage credit in that section of the country
-P-A-G-E-137
  Business MEN’s CONFERENCE 133 
would be seriously imperilled. The investigations of our American commission 
in Europe last summer revealed no such little banks doing this elass of busi- 
ness. 
Tue SourH AND THE Far Wust. 
Let us turn now to the average citizen of the great agricultural southland 
and far west. No, sir; no such little unit for him. He wants a great State 
central institution with the great name of his State behind it. All the county 
bond issues are sold to great bond houses in New York or Chicago, or some 
other far-away city, and the county attorney frequently has to go on to see 
New York and incidentally to see some bright young legal light employed 
by the great trust company, to arrange the fees for issuing the bonds and 
certifying to their regularity, a charge that some times runs as high as ten 
per cent. of the entire issue of bonds in question. The average building and 
loan in these parts of this vast country, has no money at all to lend to farmers, 
and is about twelve months behind in acting upon the applications for loans 
made by the working people in the cities. Our citizen sees around him thou- 
sands and thousands of acres of land classed by the Census Bureau as agri- 
cultural lands, which are lying there in a state of waste, owned by residents 
of the cities, or real estate speculators. He has noticed that very few farmers 
own any bonds or stock in corporations of any kind. He has noticed that 
occasionally a local farmer goes to the bank to deposit some money or to draw 
out some, but for some reason unknown to him the records at the office of 
the register of deeds, show very few mortgages placed by banks upon farm 
lands. He sees the big city bank is owned by city people and operated for the 
benefit of the merchants, the manufacturers and other business men of the 
city, but the farmer who works his own farm has practically no standing there. 
He goes over to the nearby village and he sees the little country bank, that is 
supposed to be operated in the interest of farmers and he notices that it is 
often-times one of the greatest oppressors of the farmer. He meets the young 
man from the Census Bureau who tells him that the attorney for the country 
bank said loans to farmers by clients of his were made at six per cent., and he 
goes to the farmers themselves, and finds, after figuring everybody’s fee, 
the farmers are really paying from eight to twenty per cent. for loans on good 
farm lands and are subjected to extortion, oppression and exploitation that 
are a disgrace to the country. Generally speaking he notices that frequently 
the land shark prays upon the necessities of the small farmer ‘in financial 
distress and regardless of all law against usury, without conscience and with- 
out heart, gets all for the money loaned that his victim will pay. Naturally, 
therefore, our average citizen in these parts of the country concludes that there 
is something radically wrong with prevailing conditions. He is full of righteous 
indignation. He wants the strong arm of his sovereign State to put a stop 
to all this unlawful practice of usury, and oppression of the small farmer. 
Accordingly, he reasons that this problem of bringing five per cent. money 
to the doors of local farmers is no small undertaking. Not only the best 
brains of the State, and all of the moral support of the State, but some of the 
financial backing of the State and the nation will be required to accomplish 
this Herculean task.

Sectional ideas must be harmonized and bound together into one har- 
monious whole or legislation on the subject will be ill advised and serve to 
hinder the accomplishment of the very end for which we are all so earnestly 
working. The plan that I am pleased to gradually develop before this con- 
ference proposes to harmonize these two great ideas, prevailing in the middle 
west and in the south. But so far as I am able to learn from my investiga- 
tions of the subject, no master mind has yet been able to harmonize two 
conflicting, directly antagonistic ideas. You cannot bring into a happy union 
the co-operative and the non-co-operative institutions. You cannot satis- 
factorily unite altruism and greed. ‘You cannot serve God and mammon.”’ 
We may just as well make up our minds, therefore, to throw in the waste 
basket the plan of either the co-operative local land mortgage association, 
or the plan of the capitalistic joint stock land mortgage bank. I am frank 
to say that it is very easy for me to make the choice. 
Tue Joint Stock Banx 1s Nor Surrep To THE NEEDS OF THE FARMERS. 
As chairman of the committee on rural credits of the American commission 
that investigated this subject in Europe last spring, I had as good oppor- 
tunity as any man to see for myself the workings of European land mortgage 
institutions, and I say to you, without fear of contradiction, that there is 
practically no substantial authority in Europe for the joint stock company 
bank as the best means of furnishing long-term credits to farmers. But in 
order that you may judge for yourself, I will take a little time to give you 
some authorities on this subject: ~ 
Page 23, Senate Doc. 214—Agricultural Co-operation and Rural Credit 
in Europe. 
“Under the Italian system such loans are generally made by public utility 
corporations, such as savings banks, which are institutions without share- 
holders, and consequently with no distribution of dividends. The Milan 
Savings Bank charges 4.88 per cent. on its mortgage loans inclusive of every- 
thing. It can afford to make loans at this low rate because it is a public 
utility corporation without shareholders and does not distribute dividends. 
The charge made by other banks issuing such bonds is 5.77 per cent. 
Senate Doc. No. 214, P. 157—Count Hoyos—Officer of Hungarian Land 
Credit Institution (Co-operative). 
Q.—Are these institutions which are receiving favor from the government 
driving out other loaning agencies which receive no favor from the govern- 
ment? 
A.—Yes. We drive a great many loaning agencies out, but the main reason 
is that we are cheaper, not that we receive State favor. 
Cahills’ Report, P. 30—These institutions just alluded to were public, 
not profit-seeking in the ordinary sense, and being without share capital 
on which dividends had to be paid, they were able to grant credit at a cheaper 
rate than the joint stock mortgage banks—* * * Nor were the (joint 
stock) mortgage banks inclined to seek such business when abundant urban 
business consequent upon the great development of German urban centres 
was within easy reach.
-P-A-G-E-139
  Bustness MeEn’s CONFERENCE 135 
In a letter to Dr. Coulter, published in Part 20, P. 25, Rural Credits, Joint 
Hearing, Mr. Cahill further says: “Moreover such banks tend to be permeated 
with the urban atmosphere, to be directed by men who have been town-bred, 
and who do not understand or appreciate the conditions of the agricultural 
industry or of agricultural properties generally. The joint stock mortgage 
banks show a distinct tendency to sacrifice rural mortgage business to urban 
mortgage business. The relative merits of joint stock mortgage banks and 
mortgage credit associations of the Landschaft type. I myself consiger 
the merits of the latter (i. e., co-operative) far outweigh those of the former 
(joint stock) as far as agricultural mortgage of long-term credit is concerned.”’ 
Part 20, P. 25, statement of Dr. John Lee Coulter—The German banks 
(joint stock) which do not pretend to do practically anything—only six 
per cent. of all their business is with farmers and they depend on the Land- 
schaft (co-operative), the savings banks, etc., very largely to do the business 
of the farmers. The Belgian stock mortgage banks, there are four of them, 
and the percentage of rural mortgage loans is practically negligible. 
Wolff Co-operative Banking, P. 250: 
“Government institutions (co-operative) have succeeded exceedingly better 
than our own joint stock companies formed for the same purpose, and that 
without loss to the taxpayer.’ 
But I need not weary you with authorities; the story is the same all over 
Europe. The joint stock mortgage bank is not suited to the needs of the 
farmers. But notwithstanding the lack of substantial European authority 
for turning over the land mortgage business in the United States to the joint 
stock banks, up comes the cry of old Ephraim, still wedded to his idols: “It 
may not be the European plan, but it is the great American way of doing busi- 
ness and above all let’s be Americans.”’ Well, suppose we assume that it is 
the American plan of doing regular commercial banking, both in the cities 
and in the villages. But listen, Brother Ephriam. Even in America it is the 
¢o-operative association that has done more than all other kinds of financial 
institutions combined to bring money at low rates of interest on land security 
to the door of the average citizen. The building and loan association (co- 
operative) is the only institution in our country today that makes land credits 
its sole and only business. It is this co-operative association that has been 
evolved from the minds and hearts and experiences of our people to do the 
business of providing money at low rates of interest to land owners. The 
building and loan associations are operated mainly by borrowers and in the 
interest of borrowers, yet they offer to the thrifty a safe and profitable in- 
vestment for his savings. The spirit of the money-lender does not find place 
in their councils. They are semi-philanthropic. Organized self-help is their 
gfeat basic principle. There are now 6,273 of these associations in the United 
States, and the total investment in land mortgages repayable on amortiza- 
tion plan is $1,137,000,000. I am informed that one of these associations in 
Indiana has practically driven out all competition in the way of farm loans. 
In New York there are many associations that are altogether rural, one of 
them has over $1,000,000 invested principally in farm mortgages. There are 
1,629 associations in Pennsylvania, 649 in Ohio, 130 in North Carolina, 
55 in Kansas, 16 in Montana, and 9 in North Dakota. The farm loans of
-P-A-G-E-140
  
136 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
these co-operative associations in the State of Ohio now amount to $12,000,000- 
They are now operating successfully in every State in the union except Vermont» 
nearly 200,000 persons joined their ranks last year. Their nation-wide 
popularity and their marvelous success prove how accurately they are fitted 
to American ideals, needs and conditions. 
In the face of all this knowledge why do we want to experiment with the 
organization of thousands of little joint-stock company land banks? Why 
not adopt our present building and loan associations as the foundation and 
nucleus upon which and around which to build our model land credit system? 
Why not start with this mighty host of 2,500,000 citizens already organized 
with their thousands and thousands of officers, ripe with experience, drilled 
in the work of lending money on lands as security and already imbued with 
the splendid spirit of organized self-help of human welfare? 
No system of long-term farm finance is going to bring relief to any and every 
tiller of the soil in every community in this vast country. The loans must 
all be made to worthy land owners on an absolutely safe basis, say fifty 
per cent. of the fair value of the applicant’s dependable land, and the security 
must at all times remain good. No loans can be made for speculative purposes 
on vacant, unimproved land. No wild-catting can be allowed. All reasonable 
safeguards must be thrown around the whole business so as to prevent specula- 
tion, inflation and wild-catting. 
Safe, sane, honest, local appraisement is the first great essential of a successful 
system of long-term farm land credit. It is absolutely necessary to obtain 
accurate information in regard to the character of the land offered by the 
farmer as security for his loan. The farming methods and practices of the 
farmer to whom loans are made must be reasonably controlled and” super- 
vised to the end that the fertility of the land mortgaged may be fully main- 
tained. A careless farmer by bad farming practices may easily and quickly 
exhaust the fertility of his land and seriously impair its value as security. 
As a fundamental proposition it may be stated that local appraisements must 
be done by men who are locally interested and locally responsible. It is re- 
spectfully submitted that there can be no surer and safer way to secure this 
all important local appraisement and oversight than through the officers 
of a local co-operative land mortgage association and the farmers them- 
selves, where it is the interest of every member of the association to be honest 
in his appraisal, prompt in his payments of interest and dues, and loyal to 
his institution. 
Ability to sell trust bonds secured by aggregated land mortgages on favorable 
terms is the second great essential of a successful system of long-term farm 
land credit. 
For many years I have labored in season and out of season to build up’a 
local building and loan association, and there is no firmer advocate of building 
and loan associations in America than Iam. Yet I cannot agree with some 
of my building and loan brethren of the middle west, in their cry of “Let us 
alone. We’ll do the work. Just give us time. We can issue the bonds of 
our local association and sell them to the investing public and bring five 
per cent. money in adequate amounts to the doors of the farmers of America.” 
My answer to this cry is that our building and loan associations have never
-P-A-G-E-141
  Bustness MEN’s CONFERENCE 137 
yet done this work, and as presently organized and operated, there is every 
reason to believe that they never will prove equal to this gigantic undertak- 
ing. It is respectfully submitted that no small local unit institution of any 
kind would have sufficient financial strength and machinery to market its 
bonds with the great investing public at the best rates of interest. I much 
doubt if such a local institution would be able to market its bonds in any 
considerable quantities at all. It is never wise to send a boy to do a man’s 
work. After years of agitation and deliberation in our country we have 
been compelled to provide by national law for the mobilization of the eredits 
of our units of commercial banks in order to provide strength and elasticity to 
our national banking system. We may well profit by this costly experience 
and provide in the beginning for the mobilization of our land mortgage credits 
so as to supply thissystem with sufficient strength and elasticity to accomplish 
satisfactory results. The plan that we are seeking to unfold provides for a 
State central land mortgage association in each State that will federate all the 
local co-operative land mortgage associations doing business in each State, 
and render services for them somewhat similar to services that district re- 
gional reserve banks, which we are about to create, will render to the commer- 
cial banks in its district. Meanwhile it must be borne in mind that our new 
banking and currency act is not going to be of any very great value in bring- 
ing money to farmers on land as security for the reason that commercial 
banks will undertake to restrict their loans to the classes that are eligible for 
rediscount, and under the act mortgages on real estate are not in any class 
eligible for re-discount. The federation of commerical banks was not after 
all, such a difficult problem, because we already had a commercial bank for 
every 4,000 people in the United States, and hence the Government was not 
undertaking to organize any new banks. And likewise it is not such a difficult 
proposition to federate the great numbers of local co-operative land mort- 
gage associations in the middle west and the north, where there are already 
great numbers of such associations, many of them already engaged in lending 
money to farmers on farm land security. But when we turn to the far west, 
and to the south, the number of these local co-operative land mortgage 
associations is small and practically all the loans are made on city property. 
Here is a condition that must be faced. Here self-help is not much organized. 
The country is sparsely settled and the organization of farmers into local 
associations becomes more difficult. Outside help is a necessity in the south. 
In the south we may just as well make up our minds to establish the great 
central land mortgage associations first and turn over to them the job of first 
organizing and then federating the local co-operative land mortgage associa- 
tions. 
Now, the farmers of this country are not entitled to grants of any special 
privileges from our Government any more than any other class of citizens 
is entitled to gifts and grants from our Government. The farmer should not 
be granted any special class privileges even if some of his friends in high places 
do ask for them. I have no sympathy with the cry of certain friends of the 
farmers who are now urging Congress to devise laws permitting the lend- 
ing of millions, and even billions, of Government, (everybody’s) money, 
directly to farmers at three per cent. and four per cent. interest. But I do
-P-A-G-E-142
  138 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
think that the farmer who has the proper land security is entitled to sufficient 
assistance from his Government to enable him to present his security in such 
shape to the investing public that he may secure money at reasonable rates 
of interést. Farmers are willing to pay what money is worth in the investing 
centres of this country, but they are not willing to be eternally robbed by 
land-loan sharks and “blood suckers.” Rather than subject themselves 
to oppression they prefer to allow hundreds of millions of acres of good farm 
land to remain in a state of waste that is a menace to the health and happiness 
of this entire nation. 
Under the provisions of the new banking and currency act practically 
every other class of citizens owning property has the strong arm of the Govern- 
ment behind him in taking care of his loans at commercial banks. The act 
even goes so far as to provide that the United States Government may even 
subscribe to the capital stock of the regional reserve banks. 
Why, therefore, shall we deny reasonable Government aid to the farmers 
—to agriculture—the one industry about which all others revolve and by 
which future Americans shall stand or fall. When we stop to consider that 
with all of our diversity of climate and fertility of soil our production per 
acre is less than any civilized country in the-world except Russia, and when 
we stop to reflect that we are now going to Europe for bread and to South 
America for meat to feed our people, we are forced to conclude that it is 
about time for our Government to take a hand in reviving our agricultural 
industry. 
Limited State aid is an absolute necessity in the south and west if we want 
to put farm finance on-its feet, and limited State aid will greatly facilitate 
the handling of this business in the middle west. I can say to you that in 
every country in Europe, where an adequate system of land mortgage credit 
has been of such inestimable value in reviving agriculture in order that the 
people might be fed, there was in the beginning some material government 
aid supplied for the purpose of putting the business on its feet. Organized 
self-help plus the educational and financial aid of the Government is the answer 
to the best means of financing the farm for long-term credit. Listen to some of 
the authorities on this point: 
Wolff “On Co-operative Banking” (P. 244) says: 
Another most successful off-shoot of the landschaft system is the Boden 
Credit Institute of Hungary, which has to some extent, been based upon 
the possession of an independent capital figuring as a reserve fund. In addi- 
tion to the 1,000,000 crowns (something over 40,000 pounds), granted by the 
government, 209 founders subscribed collectively 13,900 pounds, with lia- 
bility for nine times the same amount, held in reserve. This seems to have 
been considered necessary for making the institution go on new, untried 
ground. 
Wolff further says: 
Gone it certainly has, and that exceedingly well. So well as, in course of 
time, to suggest the formation of a similar institute for mortgage loans for 
peasant lands. The Boden Credit Institute is intended for large properties 
only. It grants no loans below the amount of 2,000 crowns (or $400); and the 
majority of its advances to landowners are above that amount.
-P-A-G-E-143
    Business MEN’s CONFERENCE 139 
-On page 256 Wolff says: 
They are borrowers’ institutions. They may be regarded as landschaften 
with the cramping and hampering features of those institutions removed. 
They are borrowers’ institutions, which admit any agricultural borrowers as 
members who may desire to become so in their district. In respect to one 
point, they have departed rather materially from the principle of the land- 
schaften. Persons desirous of furthering the movement are eligible as well 
and many of them do take shares. In Saxony such members are required to 
be either agriculturists or land owners. The idea of proceeding without 
a command of ready cash appears to have presented itself to the originator 
of this modern movement as so inconsistent with business principles that in 
both of the two countries to provide the first working funds an advance from 
the government was accepted. 
In the Saxony society it amounted to 37,500 pounds and was paid off within 
four years. In the Bavarian society it was considerable, beginning with 50,000 
pounds, advanced free of interest, and another 50,000 pounds, since increased 
to 200,000 pounds, advanced at three per cent, interest. 
On page 258 Wolff says: 
Absence of funds of their own would place such institutions absolutely 
at the mercy of the confraternity of bankers. With money in their pockets, 
the societies are able to meet such machinations and to regulate the supply 
of the market so as to keep it absolutely at a steady quotation, which is not 
only desirable in itself and certainly benefits their credit, but it is in addition 
specially important to their members. 
Wolff, page 250: 
The credit Foncier de Paris has received a government subvention of 
10,000,000 frances, and is practically placed under government management, 
nevertheless it is ordinarily classed as a joint-stock institution. 
In France, as you all know, the credit Foncier has practically a govern- 
ment monopoly of the land mortgage business. 
The initial capital of the forty-eight central land credit associations may safely 
and advisedly be provided in a manner somewhat as follows: 
1. A time deposit of $200,000 of postal savings funds by the Treasurer of 
the United States shall be made in each State central drawing interest at 
three per cent. upon application of the governor of that State, stating that a 
State central land mortgage association had been organized and that par- 
ticular State government had deposited a like amount of $200,000 in said 
State central drawing interest at the rate of four per cent. 
2. That thereafter as the business of making loans on farm lands progressed, 
and on application of the governor, a further deposit in proportion to the 
rural population of each State, but not, in any event, to exceed $200,000 of 
postal savings funds shall be made by the Secretary of the Treasury, with said 
State Central drawing interest at three per cent. 
3. That all of this initial deposit, both national and State, shall act as a 
revolving fund and shall be automatically reduced at the end of each year’s 
operations by means of the sum total of all entrance fees paid by borrowers 
at the time of joining the local associations who thereafter are granted a long- 
term mortgage loan by said State central and all entrance fees on investment
-P-A-G-E-144
  140 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
shares of State central. That said deposit shall also be released by payment 
of ten per cent of the yearly profits of the State central to the Treasurer of 
the United States and ten per cent. of the yearly profits to the Treasurer of 
the State. Under ordinary conditions the entire deposit ought to be released 
in less than twenty years. 
4. Further capital might well be secured by issuance of serial non-taxable 
five per cent. (when fully paid) shares of the State central. For in each 
State there would probably be a considerable number of public-spirited citizens 
who would be willing to invest a part of their surplus earnings in such shares 
and‘gradually accumulate a good block of paid-up shares not only to help 
along the movement, but for the stronger reason that they were desirous of 
finding a good, safe, non-taxable investment. 
5. Additional capital would steadily come into the State central from 
an aceimulated surplus of profits in the business, for if we may base any 
opinion of the operations of this business in America on European experience, 
the profits of the State central will rapidly accumulate. The tremendous 
indivisible surplus funds of European co-operative land mortgage associations 
are the very best guarantees that the borrowers are always going to get money 
at low rates of interest, and gradually decreasing rates of interest. Well 
may some of our eight-per-cent. banker friends feel alarmed at the mention 
of “indivisible reserve,’ the borrower’s best friend, his guarantee against 
usury and oppression. 
ADMINISTRATION OF THE STaTE CENTRAL. 
1. The Federal Government shall have authority to appoint one resident 
commissioner for each State central—salary to be paid by the central. Said 
commissioner shall have full power to inspect all the work of the central, 
and shall render a quarterly report of the institution to Secretary of Treasury 
of the United States. Said commissioner shall be especially charged with the 
duty of crediting all amortization payments on the farm mortgages, and shall 
be charged with the duty of maintaining the fixed relation between the 
collateral trust bonds and the underlying mortgages. 
He shall be specially charged with the duty of marketing all bonds issued 
by the State central. He shall be charged with the duty of seeing that the 
total issue of bonds does not exceed twenty times the sum of the revolving 
fund, paid-up shares and surplus. 
2. The State government shall appoint a second commissioner, with 
salary paid by central. He shall be specially charged with the duty of making 
independent inspections of all lands tendered as security for loans, and with 
the further duty of making an appraisal of these lands independent of all 
local influences. If, in his judgment, any loan sent to the central by the local 
be not up to the proper standards, he would be charged with the duty of refus- 
ing said loan or of reducing the loan to a safe amount. He should exercise 
the proper oversight in regard to all title papers and other formalities per- 
taining to the loan. He should be specially charged with oversight of all 
bond issues by townships, school districts and drainage districts and certify 
to the regularity of the same. He shall standardize the issuance of such
-P-A-G-E-145
Business MEN’s CONFERENCE 141 
bonds, act as trustee of the sinking funds, to retire said bonds. He shall be 
specially charged with the management of the savings bank business done 
by the State central. He shall devise a proper and fair method of dividing 
the administration charges on all long-time loans discounted by the locals 
with the State central. 
3. The third commissioner shall be appointed by the governor of each State 
on the joint recommendation of the Department of Agriculture in that State 
and the president of the State league of local co-operative land mortgage 
associations, with salary to be paid by the State central. He shall be charged 
with the work of federating all local land mortgage associations in each State 
so as to standardize their practices and increase their usefulness. He shall 
be charged with the examination at least one time each year of every local 
co-operative land mortgage association in the State, whether federated or in- 
dependent, for which service a fee shall be paid by each local to the State cen- 
tral for said examination. He shall be charged with the duty of finding em- 
ployment for the surplus funds of local associations in those parts of the country 
where such institutions are frequently embarrassed by the volume of local de- 
posits. He shall be specially charged with the work of extending the land mort- 
gage business into sections of his State entitled to loans, but without organized 
locals. With the aid of the chairman of the board of education and the chair- 
man of the board of county commissioners in each county, he should advertise 
the business of the State central, and provide means whereby any single farmer 
not a member of any local association may be brought in touch with a local and 
have opportunity to avail himself of the financial aid that it offers. He 
shall have charge of the educational propaganda of the State central associa- 
tion. 
It will be observed that the business of the local associations is not con- 
fined to farm-land loans, but loans may be placed on city property just as 
is the custom of a great many of our local building and loan associations. But 
the land mortgage business of the State central is confined to the issuance of 
bonds on underlying mortgages’ on farm lands, a safer business than loans 
on city property with costly buildings to be valued and insured. It will be 
noticed that when these local associations become federated they are pro- 
hibited from issuing trust bonds on underlying mortgages. It will also be 
noticed that the long-term loan to the farmer must come through the agency 
of the local as well as the central, and it is this joint action and division of 
administration charges that forms the basis of their association. The local 
association will find it both profitable and desirable to handle these long-term 
loans on a mutual business basis. Meanwhile, during the life of the loans 
the local is charged with the responsibility for the loan with the constant 
inspection of the property, collection of interest payments, and other fees 
and with the remission of same to State central with which it does a banking 
business on the current account basis.    
Security Beninp THE Bonps. 
It will also be observed that the total security behind the collateral trust 
bonds to be issued by the State central and offered to the investing public 
is as follows:  
-P-A-G-E-146
  142 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
(a) The note of the farmer duly endorsed by the local co-operative as- 
sociation. 
(b) The dependable farm land of the farmer worth twice the amount of 
the mortgage. 
(c) The appraisal by the committee of the local association, who, bearing 
in mind the responsibility of the local, will throw every safeguard around 
the loan and keep it safe. 
(d) Independent appraisal by State commissioner of State central. 
(e) The judgment of Federal Commissioner and all the officials of the 
State central charged with rechecking the securities. 
(f) The entire financial strength of the State central and its tremendous 
moral strength. 
(g) The aggregate of diversified, well-secured mortgages on land. Not 
dependent on conditions of any particular locality or any local disturbances 
imposed by human weakness or divine providence. 
Tuese Four anp Onn-Hatr Per Cent. Bonps Oveut ro Seti at Par. 
Many methods of popularizing the collateral trust bonds and facilitating 
the marketing of these bonds may easily be devised. 
These bonds may be made available: 
(a) As security for the deposit of all kinds of Government funds in national 
and State banks and trust companies. 
(b) As a legal investment for time deposits of national banking associa- 
tions as provided in the Federal reserve act. 
(c) As legal investments for trust funds and estates under the charge of 
any of the courts of the several States of the United States and of the courts 
of the United States. 
(d) Asasecurity for loans from national banking associations to individuals 
for not exceeding five years to an amount not to exceed one-third of the time 
deposits of the banks making such loans. 
In order to facilitate the sale of these trust bonds of the State central 
associations, it may also be good public policy to exempt these bonds from 
Federal, State and local taxation, for the underlying real estate on which these 
stand, is all taxed to the limit in this country, and any tax on the trust bonds 
must, in the long run, be paid by the farmers themselves in higher interest 
rates on the underlying mortgages. It is on this theory that similar land 
mortgage bonds are made non-taxable all over Europe. 
Similar land mortgage bonds to the bonds under discussion are universally 
considered safe and conservative investments all over Europe. In many 
cases such bonds sell at prices that compare favorably with Government 
bonds. There is only one landschaft for each province in Germany, and a 
province there is about the size of the small State in the United States, and 
the landschaft bonds are very similar to the proposed bonds of the State 
centrals, hence the market prices of landschaft bonds might give us some 
line on prices for the bonds of the State centrals. 
On June 13, 1913, a Berlin newspaper, giving stock exchange quotations,

gives us an opportunity to compare relative prices of land mortgage bonds with 
the prices of government bonds in Germany on the same date.

No Serious DisrurBance To LuciTimaTe Business. 
No serious disturbance to legitimate business should follow the organiza- 
tion of these forty-eight State central land mortgage associations and the addi- 
tion of a few thousand more local co-operative land mortgage associations 
These locals will be nothing more than standardized building and loan associa- 
tions, somewhat broadened in the scope of their operations so as to bring 
into their ranks hundreds of thousands of worthy farmers and so coupled 
up with State central associations, as to take care of the land mortgage busi- 
ness on a basis satisfactory to the farmers, to the State and to Federal Govern- 
ment. The history of banking all over the world shows that this line of 
business is absolutely unfitted to the machinery of commercial banks. It 
is an immense field that our commercial banks have never made any serious 
effort to cultivate. And it is submitted that the great bulk of our com- 
mercial banks, practically all of them that are up-to-date and above usurious 
practices will be pleased to welcome our newcomers and help to facilitate 
the establishment of the new system. Of course, the purely savings bank 
business done by the State central will mean the establishment of one more 
savings bank in each State, but when it is realized that the savings business 
of the State central is only incidental to its great work in order to help it 
pay overhead charges, and when it is realized that the bulk of the savings 
will come from the local city in which it is established, and from farmers 
remote from proper savings bank facilities, I believe that there will be no 
serious opposition to the savings bank business of the State central. It may 
be stated here that all over Europe the mutual savings bank business and the 
land mortgage business are generally associated in the same institution. 
But after these State central co-operative institutions have cleared the way 
and set the pace for bringing relief to the mighty hosts of worthy tillers of 
the soil, joint stock companies and trust companies that want to enter the 
field and claim a part of land mortgage business of this country, are welcomed. 
to do so. There have never been any serious legal difficulties in the way 
of their undertaking to do this class of business, and here and there, after 
a fashion, they are doing some valuable work along this line. After the co- 
operative State-aided State centrals have educated the investing public 
up to the practice of investing in land mortgage bonds, there will probably
-P-A-G-E-148
    144 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
be many more. joint stock companies organized to gather in for private gain 
the great profits derived from the land mortgage business. 
In the long run there will be no serious opposition to the establishment of 
the new system from respectable resources. 
Onty Usurers, Lanp Loan Suarks anp Bioop Suckers Witt Ficut Us. 
In this vast country we have a mighty host of usurers, land loan sharks and 
blood suckers in high places as well as in low places. Such people are violently 
opposed to lowering the rates of interest to anybody. These people are going 
to fight five-per-cent money to farmers with all their might and main, openly 
and secretly, consciously and unconsciously in the halls of Congress and in 
the byways and hedges. 5 
We glory in such opposition; we welcome their fight; our cause is right, 
their legions will be defeated in this world, and all their mighty hosts will 
be sent to eternal damnation in the world to come. 
It is not mammon, but God that rules. Our victory will be complete. 
STATE AND NATIONAL RURAL CREDIT LEGISLATION. 
By George Woodruff, President First National Bank, Joliett, Ill. 
The American people have for some time been discussing European forms 
of farm finance, and as the time approaches for some definite legislative 
action looking toward the betterment of agricultural credit conditions, con- 
sideration should be given to the services now rendered by our present banks 
and then such additional forms of banking institutions as may be considered 
necessary should be called to the attention of our legislators. 
In Europe, where a few large joint-stock banks attempt to serve large 
territories through the maintenance of branches, it was long ago found nec- 
essary to provide distinctive systems of agricultural credit. These systems 
comprise short-time personal credit banks, extending small personal loans 
to farmers for comparatively short periods of time, and long-time mortgage 
banks, extending mortgage credit to farmers on an amortization basis for 
long periods of time. Some of the personal credit banks are organized on a 
joint-stock basis and some on a co-operative basis, and the same is true of the 
mortgage banks, and in certain instances government aid of various kinds 
has been extended to these different types of institutions. 
The discussion of proposed American legislation on this subject naturally 
divides itself into two parts; first, that concerning personal credit, and second, 
that affecting mortgage credit. 
AGRICULTURAL PERSONAL CREDIT. 
Agricultural personal credit is already fairly well provided for in our 
country. .We have an organization of ordinary joint-stock credit banks, 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  Bustness MEN’s CONFERENCE 145 
such as has never been developed before in any country in the world. ‘These 
banks are practically all independent, locally owned, community institutions, 
and it has been contended for a long time that if they were given sufficient 
flexibility, they would be able to immediately do much more than they have 
been doing to care for the temporary needs of the American farmer. This 
flexibility will be brought about by the new Federal Reserve Act, which 
creates Federal reserve banks that will be able to bind all of the independent 
banks together, as is done in Europe, where each system of banks, whether 
joint-stock or co-operative, is held together by its respective central bank. 
This law will allow the individual institutions to apply to the reserve banks 
for re-discounts in times of need, and consequently the small country banks 
in the little agricultural communities will be able to command enlarged credit 
facilities during the seasons when the agricultural interests need extra credit, 
and furthermore, by permitting national banks to lend money on farm mort- 
gages running not longer than five years, the Reserve Act empowers the banks 
to still further extend loans to farmers for comparatively short periods of 
time. Thus, as a result of the passage of this new law, a great enlargement of 
short-time agricultural credit will be brought about and the farmer will feel 
the benefit almost immediately. 
As the agricultural sections of the country become more fully developed, 
there will, of course, be a need for additional agricultural personal credit 
banks. In the wealthier States, the tendency will doubtless be toward the 
organization by farmers of small joint-stock banks organized under our present 
banking laws. Our Jaws are’so liberal as to allow any company of farmers 
or agriculturists who are so inclined, and who can put up a moderate amount 
of capital stock, to organize a bank that will accept deposits and make loans 
on just as advantageous general terms as could be desired. However, in certain 
less wealthy States, and in States where the farmers are taken advantage of 
by the local bankers or merchants, opportunities should be provided for the 
creation of a system of co-operative banks. Such systems can be brought 
about by the passage in each State of a co-operative personal credit bank 
law similar to the Massachusetts Credit Union Law, which provides for the 
establishment of little co-operative credit banks resembling the co-operative 
banks of Europe. 
However, such States should go further than has Massachusetts, and should 
also provide for the establishment of State central banks to be co-operatively 
owned by the individual banks, the central banks to bind the individual 
banks together, to act as re-discount and deposit agencies, and to promote 
the organization, extension and proper conduct of the individual banks. With- 
out the developing power of a central co-operative bank, the creation and 
growth of the little individual institutions would probably be exceedingly 
slow, and even with the aid of such a central organization, the inauguration 
and building up of an entirely new banking system based necessarily on the 
petty financial transactions of each community would be very gradual. 
AGRICULTURAL MorraaGe Crepir. 
Our present American banking system has done much for the farmer in 
connection with the financing of his farm mortgages. However, bank deposits, 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
, 
146 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
being subject to withdrawal on demand or upon reasonable notice, have not 
been available for investment in long-time mortgages, and furthermore, 
the amount of funds which the banks have felt justified in investing even in 
short-time mortgages has not been sufficient to supply the demand. Conse- 
quently, the American farmer has never been able to borrow money on the 
long-time amortization principle and in a majority of cases, has not even been 
able to get a mortgage loan at a bank, but has been compelled to apply 
to one of the large number of mortgage brokers operating throughout the 
country. 
To remedy this situation, the Federal Government should pass a law copied 
as nearly as possible after our present national banking law, and author- 
izing the establishment of a new class of banks. These banks should.be 
organized on much the same lines as our present national banks, and should 
be subject to the same general restrictions, the only difference being that these 
institutions should be known as national mortgage banks and should have 
practically no powers beyond those of loaning money on long-term amortiza- 
tion mortgages and issuing and selling bonds secured by these mortgages. 
However, these proposed mortgage banks should, of course, be subject to 
all of the special restrictions which have been found by universal practice 
to be necessary to the safe conduct of this type of bank. Upon the passage 
of such a law, providing that it was so drawn as to make the operation of 
joint-stock mortgage banks fairly profitable, many banks would doubtless 
be promptly started because the element of personal gain would prompt 
many men to quickly organize mortgage banks and educate the public-at- 
large in regard to all of the details of this method of handling the mortgage 
business, and the farmer in a very short period of time would probably be 
able to realize a real advantage. 
It might be well for the proposed mortgage bank law to provide that banks 
could be started on either the joint-stock plan or the co-operative plan. 
As soon as the operations of the joint-stock banks had educated the general 
public to the new methods of conducting the mortgage business and had 
created a demand on the part of the investing public for mortgage bank bonds, 
farmers would perhaps begin to organize little national co-operative mortgage 
banks. Co-operative banks would doubtless begin in a small way, and would 
not grow so rapidly as joint-stock banks, but they would be somewhat better 
adapted to the requirements of the farmer and in time would tend to reduce 
the cost of borrowing money so that after awhile the farmers would perhaps 
gradually assume the ownership and control of their own co-operative organi- 
zation for handling farm mortgages. 
GovVERNMENT AID. 
In the development of prosperous, desirable citizens a little self-help is 
worth more. than a great amount of government aid, and while foreign na- 
tions have in many instances granted direct government aid to farm finance, 
nevertheless the results have not always been of the best and the American 
people would unquestionably decide against any proposition providing for 
a subsidy to the farmer. However, the national Government and the State 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  Bustness MEN’s CONFERENCE 147 
governments could be of tremendous aid to his great movement by encouraging 
and assisting in the passage of proper laws and the building up of strong and 
useful institutions. 
The national Government could perhaps go somewhat further and author- 
ize the investment of postal savings and a stated proportion of national 
bank savings deposits in the securities to be issued by the proposed new 
mortgage banks, and it might perhaps also provide for concessions as regards 
the taxation of securities issued by mortgage banks. 
The State governments could also be of direct assistance by legalizing 
the securities to be issued by the proposed mortgage banks as approved 
investments for trustees and acceptable as collateral for public deposits 
and by starting a movement for a uniform foreclosure law, and uniform sys- 
tem of registration of titles, and by the abolition of certain restrictive exemp- 
tion laws. 
The present American banking system, supplemented as it will be by the 
organization of Federal reserve banks, is the best system of personal credit 
banks in the world, and to a large extent, the short-time personal credit 
needs of the American farmer can be supplied without any large organization 
of new types of banks. However, the long-time agricultural credit needs of 
the country cannot be adequately met by the present banking system and 
consequently the interest of all those who are working for better rural credits 
in America should centre around the passage by the Federal Congress of a 
modern national mortgage bank law. 
THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF 
TAXATION. 
Dr. Charles Lee Raper, Professor of Economics, University of North Carolina. 
A system of taxation should always have two dominant ideas: (1) maxi- 
mum productiveness; (2) maximum justice. Its first purpose should be to 
secure ample revenue for the State and its minor divisions. Its second pur- 
pose should be to render the largest possible justice to all the taxpayers, both 
through the assessment of their taxable values and through the levy of rates 
upon them. 
A system of taxation must include the classes of taxables, the rates upon 
each class, and the method of placing the taxable values upon the assess- 
ment books. It must cover two big things: (1) the taxables and their rates; 
(2) their assessment. That part of the system which deals particularly with 
the classes and rates may in theory be distinct, but in practice it is abso- 
lutely dependent upon the work of assessing the values and placing them on 
public record. The proceeds of the taxes come, not from the taxable values 
as they actually exist, but from those which are recorded on the assessment 
books. The assessment part of the system, in turn, depends to a large degree 
upon the classes of taxables and their rates—as to whether these tend to make 
it practicable for the taxable values to be ascertained and recorded. A prac- 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
    
148 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
tical and reasonable scheme of taxes and an effective plan of assessment are 
both absolutely essential parts of a system of taxation. 
The plan of assessment is, almost without exception, a matter of what the 
legislature wishes to do. The constitutions of practically all of our States 
allow the legislature to make provision for effective State and local machinery 
of assessment. If certain States have not made such provision—and many 
of them, almost all of the southern, have so failed—the blame cannot, for the 
most part, be laid upon the limitations which the constitution places upon 
the legislature. It should rest upon the legislators who have failed to use 
the power which they possess, because of their lack of knowledge of taxation 
and assessment or their lack of courage to secure as a matter of public record 
the taxable values of their constituents. It should also, in large measure, rest 
upon the citizens. They either do not desire efficiency and justice in taxation, 
or they do not appreciate the complex problems of making classes of taxables, 
assessing their values, and levying rates upon them. 
Since the tasks of assessment are intimately connected with the classes 
of taxables and their rates, assessment indirectly becomes a matter of the 
constitution as well as of the will of the legislator. The legislature in most 
of our States must act under certain limitations in its selection of the taxables 
and their rates. It is, in fact, compelled to put all kinds of property, however 
different, into one lump class and to levy a uniform ad valorem rate upon 
this. This constitutional limitation may have been an excellent thing in the 
past, when land and its improvements and other kinds of tangible property 
constituted the wealth of the citizen, when the amount of wealth possessed 
by the citizen was comparatively equal. Taxables have, however, become 
less and less uniform in their value and in the conditions of their making, 
ownership or use. Today one citizen possesses much, another little; one 
possesses property of a tangible form, another can more easily conceal his. 
The constitutional requirement of a uniform rate upon all classes of taxables 
has come to mean an increasing injustice to the taxpayer; and it tends to make 
the task of assessing and placing taxables on record much more difficult. 
That State whose constitution permits the legislature to make classes of 
taxables and rates according to its judgment has the opportunity to provide 
a more effective and just system of taxation. In Europe all the States save 
Holland and Switzerland have abandoned the general property tax at a uni- 
form rate. The constitution of England places no limitation whatever upon 
Parliament as to the class of a tax or its rate. Those of Germany and of our 
own National Government place practically no restrictions; and in as many 
as fourteen States, only two of which are southern, the constitution allows 
the legislators some freedom to act as the economic and fiscal conditions 
demand. They may, at their discretion abandon the uniform rate. Such 
arate is most certainly unfair, unless all of the forms of property are accurately 
placed upon the assessor’s books; and its fairness can be doubted even when 
all taxable values are accurately recorded. Such a rate places a heavier 
burden upon the more tangible forms of property and upon the citizen whose 
mind and heart are more conscientious. Reasonable classification of taxables 
and rates is, I believe, sound in theory; and in practice it has proven itself 
to be, notably in the case of Baltimore City, relatively fair and effective,
-P-A-G-E-153
  Business MEN’s CONFERENCE 149 
though, of course, not perfect. It should, therefore, become, as soon as- 
possible, one of the essential features of a system of taxation by our States. 
The reasons which call for the abandonment of the uniform ad valorem 
rate upon all kinds of property taxables, call also for the discontinuance 
of a compulsory poll tax upon all citizens within certain age limits. Such a 
tax no longer represents, even approximately, their ability to pay taxes— 
the truest principle of taxation—or the benefits which they receive from their 
government. It is fair only when the ability and possessions of the citizen 
are practically equal—a condition which no longer exists in the great majority 
of our communities. And outside of the United States this tax has practically 
no interest save that of history. 
If the poll tax has come to be indefensible because of its injustice and 
should, consequently, be abandoned as soon as practicable in all our State 
and local taxation, what sources are left? 
From an ideal point of view, a tax on the income of the citizen ought to 
be the chief source of revenue. I once thought that it could be made in 
in practice an equitable and effective source of State revenue. But the prac- 
tical difficulties—the fact that the source of income has little relationship 
to State boundaries, ete.—seem now to deny validity to my belief. If the 
actual experiences of a State income tax are anything like conclusive proof 
of its impracticability, then we cannot look upon the income tax as an essen- 
tial feature of a taxation system for a State; and, too, the Federal Government 
has now made, in large measure, the income tax its own. Virginia has ob- 
tained considerable revenue from such a tax—approximately $100,000 a 
year for a time—but Virginia has been the only State in which any appreciable 
revenue has been obtained from this tax—the only State with a general income 
tax. North Carolina, South Carolina, Massachusetts and Oklahoma, have 
not found a partial income tax an important source of revenue. Wisconsin 
has just launched upon the idea of making a State income tax a large source 
of State revenue. What the real results will be we cannot at present even 
estimate. 
The inheritance tax as an essential part of a State system of taxation seems 
to be, on the other hand, a very practical thing. The Federal Government 
has now no such tax, while the majority of the States levy it, and they have 
come to find it an important, even though an irregular, source of revenue. 
Since the State government or its local units of administration must play an 
intimate part in the settlement of inheritances whether they are taxed or not, 
its operation need not be expensive or difficult. The fact that a number of 
the States have not made it a significant source of revenue is not, I think, 
proof of its incapacity to produce it. This fact is more largely due to the in- 
effective machinery of assessment which these States have provided. The 
average amount of revenue from the inheritance tax will be, of course, very 
different in the different States. New York may obtain more than $12,000,- 
000 from this source in one year, as was the case in 1912, while another State 
may procure only a few thousand dollars. The number of rich citizens whom a 
State may possess as well as the number who may die in any one year, is, 
of course, very variable. 
The theory of such a tax seems clear. If the citizen’s ability to pay is a
-P-A-G-E-154
150 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
correct basis of his payment to his government—and it is coming more and 
more to be approved as sound—he should make an extra payment whenever 
his capacity to pay is increased as result of inheritance. Such a tax is now 
to be found in almost every country. The more democratic the public opinion 
of the country, the more fully such a tax is developed; and the greater the 
degree to which the principle of the progression of rate, progression with the 
amount of the inheritance and the remoteness of kinship, applies. We are 
fast coming to believe that our Government should tax the possession rather 
than the person, and to do this in such a manner as to reach its ability to bear 
the tax. Taxation is now being regarded as a social rather than an individual 
thing. 
A tax on the corporation, which is playing an ever-increasing part in the 
making of wealth and in its ownership, has also come to be essential to any 
system of State taxation. Such a tax is just when it is levied solely with the 
view of reaching the ability of the corporation to pay, not as a penalty for its 
activity. The amount derived from this tax is ever growing. As a source 
of public revenue it is practical—that is, the tax can be collected without 
much difficulty or evasion. It is, in fact, as easy for the Government to collect 
such a tax as it is for it to render full justice to the corporation. Anti-corpora- 
tion sentiment may at times express itself in a rate that is unnecessarily large 
or in a method of assessment that is not just to the corporation. There is, 
fortunately, I think, coming to be a fairly strong tendency toward making 
this tax one for the State only, that is, to abandon it largely as a source of 
income for the local treasuries. There is also a tendency to adopt some other 
basis of their taxation than that of their general property, though this basis 
is still largely used in assessing the taxables of most of the corporations— 
practically all corporations except insurance companies, which cannot be reach- 
ed easily by means of a general property tax. Hither their earnings or their 
capital and loans would be a more satisfactory basis than their general pro- 
perty. The Federal Government has adopted the income basis for its tax on 
corporations. 
Taxes on business license or privileges have long been in wide use, par- 
ticularly in the South. Many States levy such taxes on the professions, on 
dealers in certain commodities, on managers of certain kinds of amusement, 
and on corporations—railway, express, telegraph, telephone, insurance, etc. 
They are rarely levied upon manufacturers. These taxes are for the purpose 
of regulation and revenue, or solely for revenue; and they are in lieu of, or 
* in addition to, taxes on property. When levied for the sake of revenue, they 
are designed to supplement the income from the general property tax, some- 
times to make it possible for the rate on this to be reduced, or to reach the 
business or the income which cannot be reached by the general property tax. 
In some States these taxes are reserved for the use of the State and the mun- 
icipality, while in others the county government is also permitted to make 
use of them. 
What professions, trades, etc., shall be made to bear these taxes, what the 
rate shall be, and upon what basis they shall be levied, and the frequency 
of their modification, are subjects of discussion, criticism, or dissatisfaction, 
but the taxes themselves seems to be firmly established as essential, notably
-P-A-G-E-155
  Business MEN’s CONFERENCE 151 
in the southern States. From an ideal point of view, a State income tax is 
to be preferred to them, but from a practical point of view the business license 
or privilege taxes are preferable. They are, certainly, more effective as a 
source of revenue than the income tax or the personal property tax as these 
have so far been administered; and there can scarcely be so much dishonesty 
and evasion in their levy and collection. They may bring revenue without 
much social or individual injustice. They may also bring some wholesome 
regulative or repressive influence to bear upon certain trades or occupations. 
It is, however, the tax on general property which is still our largest source 
of State and local revenue; and in this particular the United States is peculiar, 
since in it such a tax plays a more significant part than in perhaps any other 
country in the world. In 1902 this source contributed about seventy-five per 
cent. of the general revenue of the State and local governments of the United 
States, and since then this percentage has not fallen to any considerable degree. 
Not only is this tax the chief present source of State and local revenue, but it 
has long been such a source in the great majority of our States. In a few States 
the tendency has been within recent years to make such a tax a source of local 
revenue only; the State government has obtained during most of this time 
its revenue from taxes on corporations, inheritances, business licenses, etc. 
The State government in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Delaware, 
has, at times, received no revenue from the general property tax. The taxes 
on corporations and inheritances have been sufficiently large to make it pos- 
sible for the State government to depend slightly, if at all, upon the income 
from a general property tax. In the majority of the other States the situation 
is materially different. In 1902 more than fifty-one per cent. of the general 
revenue of the State and Territorial governments of the United States came 
from the general property tax, and since then this proportion has not vitally 
changed. 
The general property tax is at present an essential part of the taxation 
system in each of the southern States, and I see slight prospect that it will be 
otherwise in the near future. The fact that such a tax contains many crudities, 
that it in reality belongs to primitive conditions of life, out of which we are 
passing, that we now have citizens who possess no property and still have the 
capacity to support themselves and make contributions to their government, 
that property has come to possess unequal productive power, all this makes it 
impossible to defend the theory of a general property tax as the sole or even 
the chief baisis of the citizen’s direct payment to his government. Nation 
after nation has abandoned such a tax as its most important source of revenue. 
It is now only in Switzerland, Australia, and the States of the United States 
that it still remains such a source; and here its defense is that of practical needs 
rather than that of individual or social justice. This tax, as we have ad- 
ministered it, has many notable defects. Its practical crudities and short- 
comings are even greater than the defects in its theory. Almost everywhere 
it has lacked equality. The constitution of the State has prescribed, in most 
cases, uniformity of taxation, but we have had practically no pretense on the 
part of the local assessor of complying with the requirement of an assessment at 
“a fair cash value;” and the county and State boards of equalization have also 
shown slight respect for their fundamental law. The constitution and the
-P-A-G-E-156
    
152 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
law require universality in the general property tax, but personal property 
has come to bear only a slight percentage of the total burden levied upon 
general property, while it is for the whole of the United States far larger in 
total value than real property. The time once was when the personal property 
of the citizen was less than his realty, and its tangibility was as distinct, but 
now with its greatest growth in quantity has come a corresponding, if not 
indeed a greater, growth in its intangibility. * 
The general property tax has become in many States an unfair and an 
ineffective tax. And still the treasury of the State, as well as that of the 
local government, seems to need the revenue which may be derived from such 
a source. What can be done to make this, for the present, necessary source 
of State and local revenue more effective and equitable? A reasonable clas- 
sification of the different forms of property, with a reasonable differentiation 
in their rates seems both expedient and comparatively just. It would, I think, 
approximately meet the demands of sound theory and of practical administra- 
tion. To levy a rate upon the more intangible forms of personal property, 
as, for instance, solvent credits and securities, that would tend to bring larger 
quantities of them upon the assessor’s books would most certainly secure 
more revenue from them, even though their rate should be lower than that 
upon real property or upon the more tangible forms of personal property. 
Such a rate, when applied, has proven its effectiveness as a revenue producer, 
and the injustice of it is certainly no greater than that of a higher rate, than 
that of a uniform rate, which secures revenue from the more tangible forms 
of property but little or none from the less tangible. 
Another method for making the general property tax more effective and 
just is the separation of the sources of State and local revenue. In operation 
such a method leaves the general property tax to the local governments— 
the county, the township, and the municipality—and grants to the State the 
exclusive use of the taxes on corporations, inheritances, incomes, and certain 
franchises and business licenses. This method has as yet been applied in 
only a few States and in these not very systematically. As we have said, 
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Delaware have, at times, procured 
all their State revenue from the above-named sources. Pennsylvania and 
California have also had partial separation of the sources of revenue. The 
claim has been made that, as a result of the segregation of the sources of 
revenue, the general property tax will become for the local government, a 
thing of greater equity—that the citizens of each local unit of administration 
will become so deeply interested in their source of taxation, their general 
property, as to demand a fair and effective assessment of all its forms. They 
will be compelled, so the claim runs, to secure their needed revenue from such 
a tax, and they will, therefore, either assess their property at a ‘fair cash 
value’ and levy a lower rate upon it, or they will assess it on a lower basis 
and levy a higher rate upon it. It is proposed that in case the State treasury 
may not be able to secure sufficient revenue for its needs from its own sources, 
the counties may apportion to the State funds according to their expenditure 
or revenue. In this case, the amount which the State would receive from the 
county would not be in proportion to the assessment valuation of the general 
property, as has long been the case. Such an apportionment to the State
-P-A-G-E-157
  
Business MEN’s CONFERENCE 153 
treasury, it is claimed, would not stimulate the local community to under- 
value its property—the very thing which it has so often done. 
The segregation of sources has, however, not been sufficiently tested in 
actual experience. It has most assuredly not proven itself very effective on 
a general program of tax reforms. Only a few States have given it a trial, 
and these have not felt sure that it could remain a permanent thing. New 
York, for instance, has only partial segregation—that is, the State resorts 
to the general property tax occasionally, when its revenue from other sources 
is not sufficient. It should be held in mind that the States which have given 
segregation even a partial trial are largely industrial, only slightly agricultural. 
The revenue which they can obtain from certain State-wide sources—corpor- 
ations, inheritances, etc.—is, therefore, very much larger than that which 
can be procured from such sources in agricultural States like those in the 
south. New Jersey may occasionally receive as much as ninety-two per cent. 
of her State revenue from taxes on corporations, and perhaps without too 
much harm to her industrial activities, but what southern State could possibly 
secure one-half of this percentage of its revenue from this source without great 
harm to its corporation development? The tasks for each southern State 
treasury are very large. It must render important aid to the education of all 
citizens—the elementary school, the high school, the vocational school, the 
higher institutions, which will for many years to come, call for large assistance 
from the State treasury. The public highway must be developed, in con- 
siderable part through aid from the State government. The conditions of 
public health will long demand all the aid that the State treasury can render. 
In brief, the State government, rather than its local units of administration, 
will, and, I think should, be the dominant factor in the development of 
southern life and resources, and its treasury, therefore, should not be impotent 
to aid, solely because it must procure its income from a few slight sources. 
And why should not the general property of its citizens make some contri- 
bution to this State factor of developing institutions and men? 
The general property tax should, I think, continue, for some years at least, 
to be one of the important sources of State revenue in each of the southern 
States. It is now such a source. It is still an essential feature of our State 
taxation; and all our energies should be directed toward making it as effective 
and equitable as possible. This tax, as well as those upon inheritances, cor- 
porations, etc., will be inefficient and unjust unless we have machinery for 
their assessment, which has capacity and courage. No system of taxation, 
by the State or its local units, can meet the approval of the thinking citizen 
until it includes the best sources of revenue that are possible under existing 
conditions, and unless it has as an essential part, efficient State and local 
machinery of assessment. The experiences of all the States combine to make 
clear the idea that nothing short of the most capable State tax commissioner 
or commission and of the most efficient local office of assessment can meet the 
needs of efficiency and justice in taxation. 
West Virginia has taken the lead for the southern States, and her record 
of achievement in the assessment of taxable values is well worth while. 
Alabama, Florida, and Georgia have made a considerable step away from the 
long-standing conditions of incapacity and injustice, but at least one more big
-P-A-G-E-158
  
154 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
step is necessary for each of them to make the local office of assessment 
strong. These States may be driven, for the sake of efficiency and justice, 
to do what Ohio has recently done—to abandon the old and cherished idea 
of local assessment. In 1910, Ohio, after having experienced all the inequality 
and ineffectiveness possible in the system of taxation, created a State tax 
commission, and in 1913 its authority was extended so as to cover the official 
acts of every officer of assessment. Assessments in each county are now made 
by a deputy, who is directly responsible to the State tax commission; and 
complaints about assessments are no longer heard by the friends of the 
complainant, but by a district board of complaint, which is appointed by the 
State tax commission. 
We cannot yet know the results of the Ohio experiment in extreme cen- 
tralization of assessment. It is, however, reasonable to expect something 
important. We know what West Virginia has done, and her machinery 
has not been so completely centralized as that now established in Ohio. 
Relatively efficient State and local machinery in West Virginia increased 
the total assessments from $278,000,000 in 1904, to $1,063,000,000 in 1909. 
It brought a decrease in tax rate for all purposes from $2.15 on the hundred in 
1904, to 86.5 cents in 1909. Alabama, Florida, and Georgia will, I believe, 
have corresponding results when they make their whole machinery of assess- 
ment, including the local part, as efficient as that in West Virginia, or Ohio. 
And when these and all the other southern States shall put their undivided 
minds and hearts into the creation and operation of an efficient plan of the 
assessment of taxable values, we shall, I fancy, hear less of the proposed segre- 
gation of the sources of State and local revenue. We shall, I know, hear less 
of an impotent State and local treasury—a ery which can now be heard almost 
throughout the south. We shall, I fully believe, hear more of public schools 
that really teach during most of the year, of highways that can be used when 
the rains come in mass and the frosts make their deep impression, and of a 
condition of public health that will compare with the most excellent in the 
world. 
WHAT ARE THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF AN EFFECTIVE 
SYSTEM OF TAXATION? 
William A. Robinson, Memter of the Executive Committee National Tax Associa- 
tion, Louisville, Ky. 
Briefly stated—three chief characteristics: 
1. Adequate Revenue—System susceptible of changes to meet changing 
needs and conditions, without arbitrary Constitutional restrictions. 
It has been well said—a constitution should be a “rudder,” not an “anchor.” 
Responsibility and authority should be lodged with the representatives 
of the people in the law-making branch of the Government. 
2. Equitable adjustment, as to different classes of property, taxation based 
on benefits received by public improvements and protection paid for out of 
public revenue, and income derived.
-P-A-G-E-159
  Business MEN’s CONFERENCE 155 
3. Meet Methods of Other States—So that the commonwealth suffers no 
loss or injury, in competition—precisely as any well-managed enterprise would 
meet such conditions. 
No absolutely perfect “effective system’’ of taxation has ever been devised 
—therefore all systems should be subject to re-adjustment readily, and with- 
out theoretical hindrance. 
TAXATION. 
Is a fundamental function of government. 
The basis of the prosperity of the commonwealth. 
Through this means we must derive the force which gives protection to 
life and property—advancement in education and substantial welfare to 
all the people. 
Let us consider the subject then from the viewpoint of the good of the 
State—the commonwealth—not in the interest of any class. 
State and local taxation in this republic is complex, because we have forty 
eight States in the Union—all closely connected in every way—socially, com- 
mercially and financially. In fact, in many respects State lines are eliminated, 
practically—one nation. 
A singular condition exists, in that no two of the States have the same 
system of revenue. 
State and local taxation in this country being direct, has a greater effect 
upon local development than an indirect tax, as for instance, the national 
tariff—and the national tariff applies alike to all of the forty-eight States. 
Systems or TaxaTIon. 
Upon the system and its successful administration depends the “effective” 
work. 
Great changes in conditions have arisen in the past few years, in property 
interests, in great movements requiring co-operation of capital and labor. 
“Old things have passed away, all things have become new.” 
The city, the State, or the nation, which would move forward, must press 
on, along modern lines of taxation or lag in the rear. 
A learned student of taxation has said—Taxation should be so fairly 
adjusted as to secure the co-operation of the taxpayer—the good citizen— 
both in his assessments and tax payments. 
Might does not make right, and the exercise of unfair, unjust arbitrary 
authority by the State, undermines patriotic respect for government, and les- 
sens the full discharge of good citizenship in sharing the individual burden. 
Extortion may still be extortion, though under the form of law. 
A reasonably fair adjustment will bring out a larger and increasing revenue. 
This is fairly demonstrated by experience. 
GeneRAL Property Tax, orn UntrorM Ap VALOREM SysTEeM. 
That is taxation uniform as to rate, and all assessments based on value— 
“fair cash value.”
-P-A-G-E-160
  156 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
This system has been the most common in use in the States of this Govern- 
ment. 
It has long since been discarded by national government generally—(in 
Great Britain more than 100 years ago)—the United States Government 
never had it. 
States now are fast eliminating, as not adapted to modern times, with vast 
changes in kinds of properties, and increased requirements for good govern- 
ment. 
In many respects, in many States, yet with constitutional restrictions, it 
is treated as a dead letter—in many constitutions are being amended. 
In all it has proved impracticable and theoretical—a failure. 
It would seem that the bare statement of the proposition would carry the 
conviction of the impossibility of its working “effectively.” 
It has been condemned generally by taxing boards, revenue commissions 
and students of taxation. 
Attempts have been made to make it workable by various devices. 
Illustrations—For instance, Illinois and Iowa, by sealing down percentage of 
assessments (as low as twenty-five per cent. in Iowa of “fair cash value,” 
and latest by Ohio by limit of rate of one per cent.), counting by these limit- 
ations to obtain fuller return by taxpayers—but all are ieee POE and 
are certain to continue so. 
There is but one method, which will reach all property, viz.: 
CLASSIFICATION. 
All property of same class to pay same rate and not necessarily by “value,” 
but may be by income, franchise, license or value. 
Illustrations—U. S. Tariff—4,000 items and subdivided in classes—rates 
adjusted to produce revenue—U. S. Internal Revenue—same rule. Would we 
tax oleomargarine, tobacco and whiskey alike? Absurd—we must again fix 
rate to produce revenue—an “effective system.” 
Among the States (classification) Some Few Illustrations: 
Pennsylvania since Constitution 1873 (probably. before)—By wise classifi- 
cation, has built up a large revenue, with great State development along all 
industrial lines. She does not tax farm lands, or any real estate for State 
purposes at all—reasonable taxation thereon is entirely reserved for local 
revenue—county and municipal. 
In a recent year Pennsylvania increased her banking capital $70,000,000. 
This yielded the State at their low rate of forty cents (their total tax on bank- 
ing. capital) $280,000 revenue. This $70,000,000 is more than the State of 
Kentucky has invested in banking capital, including surplus, now after a his- 
tory of 120 years! 
In Louisville, State, county and city, in 1913, $2.54 on $100; capital, sur- 
plus and undivided profits, State rate same as realty—in some Kentucky 
cities higher. 
Maryland—A likely policy—a marvelous increase in revenue from intang- 
ible personalty, because of low rate, 30¢ on $100, county or city, resulted in 
State rate on farms and all real estate, as low as 16c¢ on the $100—with an 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
       Bustness MeEn’s CONFERENCE 157 
average for ten years of 18c—higher present year (about 32c) because of ap- 
propriation for public improvements, roads, ete. 
I would note that in the city of Balitmore, before the fixing of a lower rate 
on intangible personalty, the total assessed property was about $6,000,000 
—that was in 1895. In the year 1914 the assessed value of such property 
amounted to $193,000,000, being an increase of $17,000,000 in the last year. 
Wisconsin—For two years income tax (the only State) on personalty, 
reasonable rates—scaled one to six per cent. (total) on income—averaged last 
year 21% per cent. on income for total receipts, and yielded large revenue— 
large increase over old methods. 
Other States could be named, various methods of ‘classification,’ with 
marked success. 
Kentucky’s constitutional revenue amendment, passed by 30,000 majority 
in November, 1913. s 
The election was declared invalid by the Court of Appeals, because of omis- 
sion by the Secretary of State to publish full ninety days’ official notice of the 
election. 
The legislature of 1914, by large majority, authorized submission of the 
amendment to the people again in November, 1915. 
“Personalty”—Some specifications: 
Public policy and results—demonstrate the unwise taxation of certain 
subjects. 
For instance, 
Mortgages on Real Estate: 
Is unjust double taxation. 
It restricts development. 
Its burdens fall upon the needy. 
“The borrower always pays the tax.” 
Illustrations: 
State of Washington—No tax. 
Court of Appeals decision—Declared it to be ‘double taxation.” 
Tax commissioner states: ‘Following this decision, capital came into 
State in a flood.” 
“The rates on interest declined to about the rates in eastern money centres.” 
“In the city of Tacoma one building was erected by money borrowed on 
mortgage, which paid more tax to the county and State than the total tax 
on all mortgages in that city before.” 
Maryland—Massachusetts—No tax. 
Michigan, Minnesota, New York—Record fee only; 15¢ to 50¢ on $100; 
no subsequent tax. 
Great West—Built up by farm mortgage, loans now paid off, followed by 
great prosperity in that section. 
Kentucky, our great agricultural State, one-third area, yet “unimproved.” 
Other States like Kentucky. 
For farm improvements, buildings, fertilizer, ete., capital needed. 
Foreign Governments—Germany, France, even Russia—loan on ‘rural’? 
improvements, as low as four per cent. long time.

  Farmer enabled by loans to hold products for fair prices—not forced to 
sell at harvest time. This is important. 
Public Bonds—No argument is needed to show the folly of taxing our own 
loans—forces sale at lower price, and higher rate of interest—held by outside 
parties, there is no revenue—small return by local holders. The United States 
Government specifically declines to tax income even from such bonds. 
Foreign Stocks—So called, i. e., the interest of citizens in enterprises located 
wholly in another State—taxed there, and receiving no benefit at situs of 
owner; to tax again is gross injustice. As well tax a deed for land in another 
State. 
A violation of comity between States. 
Injury to State—Penalizes residence; drives out and keeps out capital. 
Illustration—Kentucky—Only $8,000 revenue from this source, last annual 
report at hand; loss to the State many times more. 
The city of Covington, opposite Cincinnati, has suffered materially in 
forcing residents of Covington, engaged in business in Cincinnati, to remove 
to Cincinnati to avoid paying a second tax in Kentucky on their industrial 
properties located in the latter city. 
In Missouri the Court of Appeals rendered a decision in November, 1911, 
denying the right of the State to tax foreign stocks, with the statement given 
that the State of Missouri had not found it necessary for her purposes to tax 
the property of her citizens located in another State. 
Deposits (without interest) in bank—the circulating medium—to tax same 
most unwise. 
Illustration—Kentucky shows $140,000,000 deposits—about ten per cent. 
only assessed. 
Pitisburgh alone $350,000,000 deposits. 
Kentucky attempts to tax. No doubt money hid away which ought to 
be out, and turning over and over. 
Pennsylvania does not tax. 
Personalty—Intangible—M ovable. 
Able Massachusetts report advises a limit of not over six per cent. on income; ° 
yields largest revenue. 
In the city of Louisville the combined tax for State, county and city pur- 
poses runs as high on some personalty as sixty-five per cent. of the income, 
and this is true of other States with like rule of taxation. 
Iilustrations—States which have pursued the wiser policy. 
Pennsylvania—The tax on personalty in Pennsylvania (total) is 40¢ on 
the $100, and yields a large revenue. The State does not tax for State pur- 
poses any farm lands or any real estate. 
Maryland—Makes a rate for city and county of 30c on the $100, plus 
the regular State rate on real estate. 
Minnesota—The rate is 30c total on the $100, apportioned for municipality, 
county and State purposes. This is equal to a six per cent. tax on five per 
cent. income. Assessment increased the second year under the new law, to 
$135,000,000—from $14,000,000 last year—old law. 
Rhode Island—Rate 40c on the $100 (total). The official reports states 
that this resulted in an “enormous increase” in the assessment returned in
-P-A-G-E-163
  BusINEss MEN’s CONFERENCE 159 
the two years in which this has been a law, and for this year, 1914, the State 
is enabled to reduce the rate on real estate for State purposes one-half! 
Industrial Corporations—Co-operation—Need encouragement. 
I mean industrial corporations (not monopolies), co-operation. This modern 
method of upbuilding industrial developments, affords a chance for the young 
man or the poor man. 
Illustration—Pennsylvania largely by industrial incorporation, increased 
her manufactured products in recent years $500,000,000 annually. 
Time does not permit further specific details—what ‘to do” or what “‘to 
avoid” to obtain an “effective system of taxation” —this general line is sug- 
gested: 
1st—“Do Not” — 
1. Do not bind the State or city by constitutional restrictions—leave an open 
way for changes wisdom dictates to meet new conditions. 
2. Do not require more of any class of citizens than under like conditions 
is required by any other State. 
2d—‘What To Do”— 
1. Promote a broad-minded interest in progress. 
2. Hold your own young men. 
3. Develop agriculture. 
4. Add industrials—make two blades of grass grow when one grew before— 
and factories and mines likewise. 
5. Encourage by purchase and use our own home products; so increase 
taxable property and lessen the burden—specially on lands, which cannot 
hide or run away. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The best system of taxation must depend ultimately upon “effective” 
administration. 
Some thirty States now have central boards or permanent commissions— 
in charge of revenue matters, and with success. 
Generally three members—men selected for their fitness specifically for this 
work, appointed by the governor with consent of Senate—economic work, 
non-partisan—terms expiring at different periods, eligible to reappointment. 
“Ex-officio” boards are generally ineffective—the men are chosen for a 
different work. 
The election of local assessors for limited term, has proven unwise. 
I quote a terse statement by the Hon. Thomas 8S. Adams, one of the tax 
commissioners of Wisconsin, and a foremost student of taxation: “It is the 
locally elected assessor who has demoralized the American property tax.” 
The local assessors (for county or State) should be appointed by the State 
board. They should be under civil service regulations, and hold office during 
efficiency. 
It takes a good assessor an average elective term to acquire understanding 
of his important duties and their discharge. 
In some States we make him ineligible for a second term. In Kentucky 
for instance. 
I recommend to your notice the ‘National Tax Association,” which is  
-P-A-G-E-164
160 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
doing a splendid work in collecting and publishing valuable information. 
Join this association (small cost) and use its work for good of your State. 
Tue Cost or Taxation. 
Few realize the enormous cost of taxation, State and local, in the United 
States (exclusive of the general Government revenue). 
The cost based on valuations (license and special taxes not included) is 
estimated—annual tax—at $1,000,000,000— it is stated “equals an average 
year’s value of crops of wheat and oats.” 
Increase for 1890 to 1902, estimated at fifty-four per cent. 
The expense of the general Government in Buchanan’s administration 
was $80,000,000—now nearly fifteen times as much. 
“The power to tax, carries the power to destroy’’—is an old revenue axiom. 
There is in our country now a danger point to be guarded. 
The subject is worthy of closer attention than it receives from the average 
citizen. 
DEVELOPMENT. 
In view of the statement as to increased volume of taxation, it is only fair 
to show briefly the development—the prosperity of our country. 
“Note the following: ; 
Farm property in the United States doubled in value between 1899 and 1909 
—ten years. 
Crops in same period increased eighty-three per cent. 
Population 1900 to 1910 increased twenty-one per cent. 
Wage earners engaged in manufacture increased also twenty-one per cent. 
—the average wage to each wage earner increased thirty-one per cent. 
Our wonderfully great country should arouse our patriotic pride, in honest 
work for her advancement. 
Conciusion—Economy OF ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT. 
Reasonable economy (not parsimony) has a most important practical 
bearing upon the question of revenue. 
The scale of taxation must follow expenditures. 
The United States Government, and the several States, are piling up their 
expenditures, enormously. This question is one deserving of serious con- 
sideration. It has now, and will continue to have to do with “effective 
system of taxation.” 
In our southland—with marvelous yet undeveloped opportunities— 
agriculturally—industrially—we are yet behind in modernizing our revenue 
systems. 
It will have large bearing as to our increase in capital and population— 
statesmanlike wisdom in the handling of this vital question is needed. 
Let every good citizen keep in mind these certain indices of real progress 
—watch for himself the official reports of growth of capital and population— 
State by State—and see how his own State stands. ‘Look forward, and lend 
a hand.”

RESOLUTIONS PASSED AT THE CONFERENCE OF BUSINESS MEN 
IN CONNECTION WITH THE 
CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH, 
LovisvitteE, Ky., Aprit 9, 1914. 
We, a committee of business men from the southern States, meeting in 
conjunction with the Conference for Education in the South and the Southern 
Educational Association, having conferred together and listened to numerous 
addresses by men engaged in the social and economic uplift of the south, 
do herewith submit the following conclusions and suggestions to southern 
business men: 
It appears to us that the southern farmer is in many instances not now 
receiving his proper share of the fruits of his labors. This is largely because of: 
1. Lack of proper standardization of his products. 
2. Lack of adequate credit facilities. 
3. Lack of adequate and fair marketing facilities. 
4. Lack of information as to the essentials of good farming. 
It appears to us that co-operation is the keynote of present economic de- 
velopment, and we suggest that southern business men should place themselves 
upon a helpful co-operative basis with southern agricultural interests. This 
can be done by the establishment of organizations for this purpose in every 
town. 
Such organizations should employ competent paid secretaries and have 
sufficient working funds. They should co-operate in the maintenance of 
fair and satisfactory markets for the purchase of farm supplies and the sale 
of the products of the farm. They should promote good roads. They should 
co-operate with and supplement the work of all agencies working in behalf 
of the social and economic improvement of rural conditions, and should es- 
pecially foster and encourage the excellent work of the United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture and of the several State departments. 
They should encourage and promote the standardization of crops, the im- 
provement of farm seeds, the introduction of new and better varieties of 
plants and animals. They should assist in providing better means of ob- 
taining credit by the man in moderate circumstances. They should encourage 
vocational education in both town and country, and attempt to extend this 
class of teaching to the great body of the children attending our schools. 
They should study economic conditions and possibilities and, as far as pos- 
sible, carry out a wise and effective system of development of the resources 
of the section. 
If the above program is carried out it will be of great assistance in the de- 
velopment of all interests and the prosperity of all classes. If it is not carried 
out in some measure by co-operation between the urban and rural business 
interests, the farmers should and will eventually form co-operative associa- 
tions for the protecting and fostering of their interests. We believe that the

middle man occupies a useful place in our economic life, but he must serve 
with economic efficiency and adjust his business to meet present day demands.

MESSAGE. 
We, the business men of the south, in conference at Louisville, Ky., April 
9, 1914, send greetings to the various associations whose purposes are the 
development of the south through the education of its people in agriculture 
and, in general, in rural life development, in all its phases; and would respect- 
fully suggest the need of the full co-operation and federation of all the construc- 
tive forces of the south to the end that time, effort and resources may be con- 
served and results be more effective, for the early realization of our greatest 
possibilities.

164 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
THE CHURCH’S PLACE IN THE COUNTRY COMMUNITY. 
Rev. Warren H. Wilson, Presbyterian Board of Missions, New York. 
So much has been said on these questions of community life, and in par- 
ticular so well said in regard to the church, that I see opportunity for only 
a personal confession. My own work in the country began twenty years 
ago, and when, as a pastor, I had a church successful in the respects of evan- 
gelism, Bible study, pastoral work and organized social life. Yet I cannot 
say that that work has grown as it should. I have to confess an element of 
disappointment. With wider knowledge I think now that it lacked two ele- 
ments of permanent and sound rural ministry. We had then no sympathetic 
knowledge of the economic life of the farmer and we did not realize the de- 
pendence of the country church upon the country school. In these two re- 
pects the community in which I then served has lost rather than gained, 
and in these losses the church has been heavily burdened. 
Within the past six years I have seen the country life movement grow and 
from the first the church has been called in as a vital factor. By President 
Roosevelt’s country life commission the co-operation of the church with the 
farm and the school agencies was demanded. It was not the enlarged vision 
of the church that made it seek a part in the country life movement, but 
it was the invitation of educators and statesmen which brought the church 
into the country life movement. Their reason doubtless was that the church 
in the country, in spite of its deficiencies to which I have as a minister, made 
confession, is an essential factor in community life. In the days of its greatest 
weakness the country church has been declared essential to the life of the 
farmer. It has always ministered to the personal life, however little it has 
done for the life of the community. Indeed it has frequently carried its per- 
sonal ministry to the extreme of dissolving the community in an acid bath of 
individualism. 
But a great change is coming. The churches are ceasing to regard the ex- 
ceptional and unusual in religious experience. They are turning their minds 
to the typical and the representative experiences. Religious people are turn- 
ing away from frantic or ecstatic emotional life to reasonable and average 
religious life such as common folks can understand. When this is done and 
when religion becomes a possession of the average man, then the days of weak- 
ness in the country church will be over. 
For in the past American religion has cared so much for the individual 
that it has permitted him to dominate the church. The stubborn elder or 
the strong-headed deacon could lead out a following from the church to which 
he refused obedience, and establish another church across the road. He could 
call down the blessing of God and set up the sacraments and secure a preacher 
of the doctrine, the whole being done to express his and other men’s inde- 
pendence and insubordination. We are coming to have a belief in a holy 
organization. We need, in America, the doctrine of a sacred and a holy church. 
Until we have the Old Testament doctrine of the tabernacle and the temple 
—which Jesus called ‘““My Father’s house’—believed and taught in America, 
we cannot have a church that serves the community. No church can serve
-P-A-G-E-169
  PREACHERS’ CONFERENCE 165 
the community which is a slave to individual preferences—the football of 
insubordination and individualism. 
I may briefly mention three great factors, in some form or other always 
present, in the churches which are serving communities throughout this coun- 
try. First of all, they generally minister in some manner to the economic 
needs of the community. Now do not say that I said that the minister 
must teach the farmer how to farm, for I did not. I see no reason why the 
minister.should be everywhere a pedagogue. Let him learn from those who 
know better than he. I do say the minister must be a learner in the great- 
est science and art of agriculture. The time is past when a minister, however 
learned or pious, can be a farm fool. He must be intelligent as to the life 
of the people about him and sympathetic with their needs. The American 
farmer is praying for land and he needs a man of God to help him. The 
possession of land is for those who know, the body of knowledge now being 
offered to country people. The minister, as a student, had better study 
the land which God has given and the living creatures which God has made 
for the use of mankind, than the books and the learning of the past to which 
he sometimes gives too much attention. 
Second, the church in the country must have a school policy. Protestant. 
churches generally do not maintain parochial schools as the Catholics do, 
but none-the-less we believe our churches are dependent on schools, as the 
Catholics do. Only the Protestant school is the public school. The minister 
does not control it. The church must not dictate its policy. The relation 
of the church to the school is spiritual; that is, a persuasive relation. It is 
the higher and more difficult task of the Protestant minister. and member to 
influence the school through citizenship and public service. 
We believe, who have studied the country situation and who realize the 
dependence of the country church upon the country school, that the con- 
solidation and centralization of schools in the country is essential to the 
development of strong country churches. This is not the only purpose of 
these schools; but if the church is to minister to the country, it must demand 
of the country the co-operation of a sister institution; for in the ministry 
to be rendered by the church in the country the yoke-fellow of the church 
is the community school. 
Third—Ministers in all parts of the country are turning their hand to 
social service. I know some men who are deliberately undertaking to direct 
the recreative and social life of the community. They believe that by no 
less thorough method can the needs of the country be met. Their direction 
does not mean suppression of play, or prohibition of dances, or opposition 
to the games. But it means, to the contrary, the furnishing of adequate 
social and recreative life. In all this we have learned great lessons from the 
colleges, universities and Young Men’s Christian Associations. There is 
one man who makes his church responsible for the celebration of Fourth of 
July, and he gets 3,000 or 4,000 people together to a great feast on that day. 
Another church celebrates Thanksgiving Day with a great dinner at which 
all the congregation sit down together to the praise and glory of God. Another 
church makes Christmas Day its own and brings the people together in honor 
of the Saviour’s birthday. “In all this recreative life, and I might enlarge
-P-A-G-E-170
  166 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
extensively upon it, the principle is observed that recreation is moral. It 
has to do with conscience. It is in the field of organized play that men learn 
obedience, self-sacrifice, subordination of one to the other, honor, truth- 
fulness and other sterling virtues of the citizen and of the soldier. 
In so great an assembly as we have in Louisville, it is right to testify, and 
to proclaim the fact that the church and the Christian religion have an 
essential place in this great movement of organization of country life. With- 
out religion it will not succeed. We churchmen, who confess the weakness 
and poverty of our own policies and who acknowledge our debt to you edu- 
cators and governmental agents, we still remind you that your work and 
ours must be done in a religious spirit, if it is to help the community and 
the commonwealth. Permit me to name some factors of the Christian spirit 
which must govern our action in the country life movement. 
First—We must do our work with perfection. Slovenly, careless and 
half-done work will accomplish nothing and will set the cause backward 
many years. Jesus said, “Ye must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is 
perfect.”” It is very evident that God is working in this movement of the 
country community, because it demands of us perfect work with no flaw, 
marred neither by haste nor by indifference. 
Second—In this work we are not concerned with the betterment of men 
or with their uplift, but our business is to serve. We are to help men to 
survive. We are to continue and to make possible the perpetuation of social 
institutions and of communities. We are to keep the people together and 
prevent their being “dispersed and scattered as sheep without a shepherd.’ 
Let us free our minds from any thought that we are to improve our fellows. 
The farmer does not need improvement at our hands, but in his present ex- 
igency he needs, for the time being, to be helped. He and the Almighty 
together will look after the problem of betterment. 
Third—The last factor in the Christian spirit is obedience. Co-operation 
is simply organized obedience and all through these days in Louisville you 
have heard about co-operation. Your discussions and addresses might have 
been taken as commentaries on chapters of the Bible, for in every chapter 
of Scripture we find the command that we obey. Obedience is the Chris- 
tian principle. It is an essential principle in this country life movement. 
We must learn to obey one another. Above all, the churches, which are 
custodians of the motives in the great enterprises of mankind, must learn to 
obey one another. | 
I do not look for the consolidation of the churches. 
It may come, but I do not see it coming. When we are confronted with 
differences of Christians I know no way out except in prayer and in the 
secret persistent unity with the Almighty. He has not revealed the plan to 
any human being. But retaining our freedom, it is for us Presbyterians to 
learn how fruitfully we may obey the Baptists; and for Methodists to know. 
the times and occasions when they should obey Congregationalists; and for 
the Protestant Episcopal church to get it into her proud head that there are 
times when even her bishops should recognize the authority of the Methodist 
church. I have myself had much happiness in co-operative enterprises in 
which other denominations have led. This.is the spirit of co-operation as
-P-A-G-E-171
  
PREACHERS’ CONFERENCE 167 
we have studied it here. It is an organized philosophy in which, retaining 
the freedom of your individual property and lives, you prosper by obedience 
unto those leaders appointed in common, who command and who direct enter- 
prises for the common good. 
If we can learn to work together in a Christian spirit, to govern a divided 
and dispersed country population in such manner that the principles of the 
gospel shall prevail in the organization of economic and educational and 
social life, then I am sure that the country life movement will prosper. And 
in this way, though the church itself may not in its membership or its property 
show statistical gains, it will prosper in the greatness of service. Then the 
church will be an essential of the Christian community and the leader of it. 
For it will be “greatest of all,” in that it is “servant of all.” 
THE PROBLEM OF THE COUNTRY CHURCH. 
Rev. Frank M. Thomas, D. D. 
Twenty-five years ago the greatest problem in the eccelesiastical world 
was that of the city church, how to maintain it in the face of the complex 
and pleasure-full life of the modern city. But that problem is being solved. 
Heroic pastoral work, steady evangelism, thorough organization—this trinity 
has been enabled by God’s help to overcome the world, the flesh, and the 
devil. The struggle of the church for existence has now shifted from the city 
to the country. It is the country church which is now threatened with dis- 
solution. It is claimed that in one Mississippi Valley State that at least 
1,500 country churches have been closed. And there are but few sections 
the United States east of the Mississippi where there cannot be seen large 
white churches surrounded by the graves of its dead and over which the spirit 
of death broods. How often is heard this expression, ‘We do not know what 
is to become of our church. Things are not like they once were.” But the 
disease from which many of our country churches are suffering is even more 
deadly than it seems. Recent careful studies of the country church in several 
portions of the United States reveal the fact the drift of members toward 
the towns and cities is not the sole explanation of their present condition. 
In many sections the country population has not only not decreased but 
increased. Investigations of church records show that in many country 
churches the apparent membership is larger than it was twenty-five years 
ago, but the actual attendance has decreased from fifteen to twenty-five per 
cent. In Windsor county, Vermont, the loss in membership in forty-nine 
churches in twenty years has been but one per cent., while the loss in attend- 
ance has been twenty-eight per cent.! Surely here is one serious aspect of 
the country church problem. Why this decline in attendance? Almost every- 
where in our rural sections you can hear the people talking about the large 
congregation that once attended the churches. And yet the enrolled member- 
ship shows but little actual loss. Where is the trouble? As it is a part of the 
duty of this Conference to inquire into this, it would not be proper in these
-P-A-G-E-172
    
168 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
opening remarks to discuss the causes. But this much may be ventured. 
The top-soil of rural life has been removed to the cities. As Dr. Warren 
Wilson puts it, “The rural exodus has had its Moses in the rural college student, 
its Aaron in the country minister, and its Miriam in the country school 
teacher.” These three have been largely responsible for the drift of the choice 
young men and women to the cities, leaving no leaders for the country com- 
munity and the country church. In addition the salary of the country preacher 
has not the purchasing power it had twenty-five years ago. The old type 
of country minister is passing away, and just as soon as a bright young preacher 
begins to show ability in developing country charges ‘“‘the powers that be” 
call or bring him to the town or city. In addition rural life itself has under- 
gone or is undergoing a tremendous social and economic change. In America 
most rural communities have passed through three periods—the pioneer 
period, which was intensely individualistic, the period of the land farmer with 
his strong community life, and the period of the land exploiter with its new 
tenantry. We need not speak of the pioneer, though that was a glorious 
period in America. The period of the land farmer, the man who lived on the 
land, who brought up his sons and daughters to love the soil, who with his 
neighbors created a strong and kindly community life, has been well designated 
the classic period of country church life. Fortunate the minister who ever 
had the privilege of serving a church of this type. He moved in a genial, 
kindly atmosphere, the like of which will perhaps not be seen soon again, 
while as far as his personal comforts were concerned, he and his family never 
had need to lust for the flesh-pots of Egypt. 
Old hams, fat chickens, golden butter and toothsome vegetables removed 
all such desires. But the landed farmer in many sections has disappeared 
from the soil. In most cases he has moved to the nearest large town, where 
he furnishes a stable moral force, and is from a human standpoint largely 
the secret of the successful revival meetings more frequently reported today 
from small towns than from country churches. Habituated by long training 
to attend church even when not a mémber thereof, his family is in no small 
measure the secret of the growth which has marked the church in our towns 
and small cities. But so far the country church has seemed unable to grapple 
with the problem presented by the new tenantry which has followed in the 
wake of the land exploiter. They readily respond to the annual revival appeal 
but when that is over they are practically dead to the church for another 
year. In addition many of them shift their habitation annually, so that it 
is well-nigh impossible for the usual methods of church work to do anything 
helpful with them or for them. Is it any wonder that many of those who 
knew the country church in its classic period shake their heads mournfully 
and look blankly toward the future? But the future is not all dark. 
In the darkest period of the American country church there has been 
heard a voice, a cry in the night, ‘“‘Back to the land.’”’ The economic wave 
which desolated the country community and the country church is turning 
back again and flooding the fields with new manhood. In the words of one 
who has studied it perhaps more profoundly than any other, “already the 
country population is homogeneous and is selected with a view of fitness 
for the environment of the rural community. As the city is breeding its own
-P-A-G-E-173
PREACHERS’ CONFERENCE 169 
stock, who are possessed with the problem of city life, and devoted to the 
interests of the city, so the country in the shifting of modern populations is 
coming to have its own kind of people, among whom the problems of the 
country community are being provided for by suitable organizations. The 
purpose of those who serve the country population shall be the construc- 
tion of suitable institutions by which country life shall be made worth while. 
These institutions must be economic, for the securing of prosperity to coun- 
try people, social institutions which shall build up moral character and 
life, educational institutions whereby the problems of country life shall 
be understood in the light of all human life, and religious institutions which 
shall crown the life of the country people with hope and animate the individual 
with the spirit of self-sacrifice on behalf of the people of the community and 
the world.” 
It seems needless to add that in this new economic reconstruction of country 
life the church must be the community centre. ‘It should vitalize all the 
forces of education, experience, and social and industrial organization for 
the general good.”’ To do so it must lead the way in recovering the community 
life. In contrast to the methods which have been so successfully employed 
by the city church, it must, for the present at least, place social organization 
first. Our Lord first established the nucleus of a community life for his fol- 
lowers before he sent them forth to preach. An army chaplain, no matter 
how evangelistic, knows how powerless he is to conserve character, for the 
lack of some definite organization in which to gather his converts. What 
the city man with his social life organized to the limit needs above everything 
else is the pure evangelistic appeal. But the lone tenant in any of our farm- 
ing communities has heard about “last things’ so much from the pulpit 
and so little of “first things’? from the supposedly Christian community 
about him that the gospel does not have its full reaction on him and his life. 
But when the church leads the way in uniting him with his fellows for his 
economic, social and moral betterment, he begins to have a new vision of 
both heaven and earth. A country pastor who attended this Conference at 
Richmond last year said this, ‘That Conference set me to thinking. For 
twenty years I have been going in and out among my people, preaching the 
gospel, christening the children, burying their dead. Now I am going home 
and going to work.” 
Turspay, APRIL 7. 
It was generally agreed that for a minister to live in the country and bring 
up his family there it would require more consecration on the part of the min- 
ister and his family, and the realization that the country work was so different 
from the city work as to necessitate a somewhat special preparation. Also, 
it was agreed that there must be a more general approach to the people, 
and a more generous response on their part through the every-member canvass. 
The third topic, ‘Can the Denominations be Brought to Co-operate?” 
was entered upon. It was agreed that the churches now feel themselves 
generally one in spirit with each other, and that they are willing to co-oper- 
ate, sometimes by denominations as a whole, as in the matter of intemperance, 
through the Anti-Saloon League, but more frequently as local ministers  
-P-A-G-E-174

see local needs and together battle for the right. It was also agreed that 
often the ministers were led into co-operation by the people. 
~ THE COUNTRY CHURCH PROBLEM IN KENTUCKY. 
Rev. W. E. Thomas. 
Iam a minister of the Kentucky Conference of the M. E. Church, South. 
My life has been spent in Kentucky, and my labor has been given to both 
the Blue Grass and the mountains of this State. My knowledge of the coun- 
try church is limited to the State of my birth, but I am inclined to think that 
the general conditions of our section of our southland are similar to those 
of other sections. 
During my thirty years in the ministry I have been pastor of three or four 
country churches, and I have been presiding elder of more than fifty. From 
this it will be seen that I have had opportunity to know something of the 
country church in my own denomination, and I have observed closely those 
of other Christian bodies. 
I am convinced that very few of our country churches are as strong and 
prosperous now as they have been in the past. Among the twenty-five or 
thirty in the large district I now serve, but one is stronger than it was ten 
years ago. I do not think the other denominations in this same section can 
make any better showing. 
Most of these country churches have services but one Sunday in the month. 
Perhaps a majority of them have no Sunday schools during the winter. Very 
few of them have prayer meetings or Epworth Leagues or Christian Endeavors. 
Very few pastors live in the country with their people. In the bounds 
of one of the districts I have served, one denomination has seventy-five or 
more congregations and but six resident pastors, none of these living in the 
country. 
A very large per cent. of these country churches are served by students from 
the seminaries; most of the others by ministers who have had little training 
and are poorly equipped for their work. 
Evangelism has become the main reliance for keeping up the membership. 
The protracted meeting has taken the place of close pastoral oversight, and 
systematic cultivation of the field. 
In some places there is yet need of new organizations, but as a rule the 
denominations crowd upon one another, and the community is divided into 
three or four rival, if not hostile, camps. Under these conditions the churches 
are small and weak, both numerically and financially, and incapable of doing 
the work that needs to be done. 
In Kentucky, at least, great changes are taking place. Country life was 
at its best in the Blue Grass a generation ago. The best homes, the most 
wealthy and substantial people, families of great culture and character 
and influence abounded on the beautiful farms in this part of the State. Many 
of these splendid homes are now broken up, the families have moved into the
-P-A-G-E-175
       
    
      
    
                            
        
              
    
   PREACHERS’ CONFERENCE 171     
cities or gone to other States, and the farms are now largely occupied by ten- 
ants. Since tobacco has become the chief money crop, great numbers of to- 
bacco tenants have moved in. Some of these are high-class citizens, but many 
others are very poor and very ignorant. They shift from place to place, and 
are not at all inclined toward the churches they find near their new homes. 
Again, many of the Blue Grass people have been investing their money in 
the coal and timber lands of the mountains. Many of the mountain people 
have been selling their mineral lands and coming to the Blue Grass to buy 
farms. 
In the midst of this transition, many of the old and formerly strong churches 
have been abandoned. Those that remain have not yet succeeded in winning 
the new elements to their membership, and thus the unchurched population 
of the Blue Grass is so large that this section is in places a veritable mission 
field. It cannot be questioned that the country church is not reaching the 
people in our rural districts as it ought, nor is it entering into and dominating 
the life of the community as it might. It is not a failure. With serious limit- 
ations and handicaps it is doing a great good. But it is not by any means, 
reaching the full measure of its privilege or obligation. ‘ 
It will be your work during the few days of this Conference to discuss the 
problems of the country church. Its support is inadequate, in many cases 
pitiful. I know churches claiming more than 150 members which pay their 
preachers less than ten dollars a year! How shall we increase this support 
so as to secure trained and well-equipped pastors to live among the people 
and devote their lives to building up the country churches ? How shall we 
broaden the work and enlarge the service of these churches so that they may 
reach all the people and lift them up into the blessedness of a fully developed 
Christian life? How shall we bring to the same level in Christ Jesus the land 
owner and the tenant, the rich and the poor, the cultured and the ignorant? 
These are some of the problems to which we must give consideration. 
Wepnespay, Apri 8. 
           
        
                        
        
    Rev. W. H. Mills illustrated by diagram the ideal development of a country 
community for the largest community service. He showed that the church 
and the schoolhouse should stand side by side; that each should have a home 
for its leader—a parsonage and a teacher’s home; that there should be a 
farm plot for the school and a small farm for the church; and that there ought 
to be an athletic field, and a community grove for community purposes. 
He particularly emphasized the church farm as furnishing a means of ap- 
proach to the people through their daily life. He insisted that the people 
ought to work this farm, both for the sake of the social life, the sense of work- 
ing together for the sake of the church, and because it would frequently secure 
larger contributions to the benevolent work of the church than the usual 
collection. He insisted that the country church must serve the community 
needs, and that no matter how small it was it could be made to help forward 
the social and economic life, as well as the spiritual life, of the community. 
After some discussion, it was ordered to consider the question of a survey 
of the community. It was shown that these surveys are conducted by home
-P-A-G-E-176
     
   
                                      
    
       
  172 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
mission boards, by farmers’ unions, by local ministers, and it was generally 
agreed that a survey was necessary in order to reveal conditions, that remedies 
might be intelligently applied. ‘ 
Miss Jessie Field, the secretary of the national Y. W. C. A. in its work 
for the country girl, was present, and made a short but most interesting 
talk upon the relation of the everyday life to the spiritual development of 
the individual and of the community. 
Rev. J. J. Cole presided over the afternoon session. He discussed the 
following difficulties hindering Sunday school work in the country: 
1. Absence of competent leadership. 
2. Lack of proper equipment. 
3. Too great isolation. 
4. Too little leisure. 
Rey. E. A. Jopling, secretary of the Kentucky Sunday School Association, 
addressed the Conference on teacher-training. He suggested that a small 
class, meeting on Sunday, at the same hour with the Sunday school, and 
really studying any one of the courses put out by the denominations, would 
secure a few efficient teachers. 
“The Social Life of the Young People” was discussed by Rev. Lucian V. 
Rule. He showed that by the use of the scout movement the pastor could 
get a hold upon his young people and so lead them toward righteousness and 
the church. 
HOME OWNERSHIP. 
Rev. W. H. Mills, Clemson College, South Carolina. 
In discussing the question of home ownership, and the related questions of 
landlord and tenant, I shall begin with the statement of a few propositions 
now so thoroughly established as to be almost axiomatic. 
1. The desire to own one’s home is natural, inherent, and instinctive. 
2. This natural desire is therefore God-given, and is legitimate and right. 
3. This desire, being natural, God-given and right, cannot be entirely or 
always restrained in the individual or community, or the nation. All re- 
pression and restraint in the gratification of this desire is to a degree harmful, 
if the final result is the deprivation of the individuals, to any large number, 
of the ownership of their homes. As far as possible, the freest opportunity 
should be given to all to acquire homes. Hence, it follows that the best 
renting system is the one that most nearly approaches home ownership, by 
long leases, the certain securing to the tenant of the fruits of his labor, whether 
expended in permanent improvements, or in careful farming, and perhaps, 
the payment of the rent stipulated in money. : 
4. As those who own the land suitable for homes are generally unwilling 
to part with it except upon. terms advantageous to themselves, there arises 
sooner or later a conflict between the land owners on one side, which con- 
flict is sometimes peaceful, sometimes bloody, but which must continue, 
          
            
              
              
        
      
-P-A-G-E-177
PREACHERS’ CONFERENCE 173. 
till every man who earnestly desires his own home, may acquire it, and be 
secure in his enjoyment of it. 
5. The principles governing this desire, which is natural, God-given and 
right, may be expected in the moral law, and will be found more fully revealed 
elsewhere in the Holy Bible. 
6. It is the duty of ministers of the word, to interpret these teachings 
of the Bible with respect to home-ownership, and assist the people to apply 
these teachings to their life. 
I have only a word or two concerning the first four propositions. 
Every normal man has certain feelings, characteristic of him as man, 
such as the feeling of self-preservation, the wish to reproduce his race, and 
knowledge of the difference between right and wrong. Along with these 
characteristic innate or instinctive feelings, must be placed, it. seems to 
me, the desire for a home of one’s own. Just as each pair of blue birds build 
their own nest, and to that same nest return year after year, so when a man 
and woman are married, it belongs to them, to wish to set up a home of their : 
own in all senses. The ground must be their ground; the buildings their . 
building; the furniture their furniture, to change it as shall seem good to them, 
and to them alone. 
This feeling, since it is found in both savage and civilized man, must be 
made in him, created in him by God from the beginning, and as God is its 
author, it is therefore to be exercised as truly as other instincts and feelings 
so given. It is certain that the gratification of this desire has not been pos- 
sible among the nations of the world generally, and that no other subject 
gives statesmen and parliaments half so much concern. Life, liberty and 
the pursuit of happiness are inseparably bound up with the ownership of the 
family home. 
It has therefore become the policy of almost all nations to provide ways 
and means for the acquiring of homes by that part of the people hitherto 
without homes of their own, peaceably if so it may be done, but forcibly, 
if force be necessary. I will not weary you with any catalogue of these 
nations, or their methods, but will refer you to the large volume issued from 
the Government press of our own country, containing the evidence on ‘‘Agri- 
culture Co-operation and Rural Credit in Europe” secured by the com- 
mission that studied there a year ago. Suffice it to say that we have come to 
the parting of the ways in our own country, and in our own section. We 
must provide means for the acquiring of homes for those now without them, 
or it will be said of us as of Rome, ‘‘The great estates have ruined Rome.’’ 
It is my purpose to consider more fully the last two propositions, and to 
them I now ask your attention. 
The principles governing this desire, which is natural and right, and God- 
given, may be expected in the moral law, and will be found more fully revealed 
elsewhere in the Holy Bible. 
A hint of it may, it seems to me, be found in the Eighth Commandment. 
If God designs that every man shall have his own home, the explanation of 
the great multitude that are without homes lies in the fact that the home has 
been stolen: And by this 1 do not mean that our neighbors have been in any 
large numbers actually defrauded and cheated out of their homes, but that
-P-A-G-E-178
    
174 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
the constitution of our society and the laws, and the customs and habits 
under which we live, do restrain and prevent the gratification of this desire. 
For instance, because land is not from its very nature as easily a fluid asset 
as stocks, bonds and other perishable commodities, the avenues of credit 
have been generally closed to the man who had only land to offer as security 
upon which to borrow; and even though banks are now loaning more and more 
upon land, yet their loans are still for thirty, sixty and ninety days as a rule, 
and they do not enable the people to attain the end, which is to acquire the 
ownership of the home. 
Our loose thinking, our careless nosiety: our one-sided construction of law, 
has imposed upon the buying of land by the poor man conditions almost 
impossible of fulfilment, that he shall pay down “one-third or one-fifth cash, 
and the balance in three or five years, with interest from date at eight per 
cent.” Individually we haven’t stolen. O, no! But collectively, we have 
taken away the possibility and the hope of owning the home. 
But the plan and will of God is seen more clearly in the Tenth Command- 
ment, “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house .’ Remember 
that this law is given to men normally constituted, and it appears, that a 
man is to have first his house, his home; second, his wife; third, his depend- 
ents, both human and animal, that assist him in the earning of his living. 
Before a man has a wife, let him have a home; that seems to be the teaching 
almost upon the face of this commandment. A house, a home site, a wife, 
those helps which develop the home and make possible the maintenance of 
wife and the rearing of children, these it is the will of God, our beneficent 
Creator, that every normal man should possess and enjoy. But if these are 
merely hints, what shall we say when we consider the. practice of God in 
settling the Israelites in the Promised Land? For assuredly, this was done 
according to their families, to every family, a possession. (Lev. 25:23-31.) 
If we begin to find foundation for our constitutional and representative 
government in Moses’ laws, if we find there the basis for our sanitary law, 
may we not also find there a firm foundation for the principles, at least, of 
our political economy? This law of the land consisted evidently, of three 
parts. First, the land could not be sold in perpetuity. Second, redemption 
was granted, either to the next of kin or to the man who had himself sold 
the land. Third, if redemption was not effected, then the land went auto- 
matically out of the buyer’s possession in the jubilee year, and each man who 
had sold returned unto his own possession. No Jewish family could be longer 
than fifty years without a home, and a home that was hallowed as “‘the heritage 
of my fathers.” If a man lost his farm, it came back to him in his old age, 
probably, or else his son got it back. But I do not ask you to notice so much 
these details as the principles that underlie this law: 
1. That every man should have his own home, and that home a farm of some 
sort. 
2. That these family possessions should break up into still smaller holdings. 
3. That effective measures were taken to prevent the accumulation of 
large estates, and the handing of them down to successive generations, since 
all property acquired by purchase was broken up into its component parts 
at the end of every fifty years, and possession of it ceased.
-P-A-G-E-179
  PREACHERS’ CONFERENCE 175 
By these means a permanent landed aristocracy was rendered impossible, 
a permanent tenant class avoided, and a class of small landed proprietors 
created and increased. 
I have not thought of advancing this Mosaic legislation as law for us today, 
but I have brought it forward as showing what is the mind of Jehovah. It 
does indicate clearly what God wished as the civil state of His chosen people. 
It shows unmistakably that it is His will that every man shall dwell under 
his own vine and fig tree, and conversely, that no man shall join house to house 
or lay field to field till there be-no room, and he dwells alone in the midst 
of the land. 
Beyond all peradventure of doubt, the law of the New Testament is “Thou 
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” Under that law we live. Obedience 
to it must be not merely of the letter, but of the spirit also. Therefore, if 
I want my home, my little plot of ground, my neighbor wants his too. If 
I am determined to get mine, let me accord the same determination to him. 
If I should like the ways and means of obtaining my home as easy as possible, 
then let me help to make them easy for my neighbor. If I am active in the 
obtaining of my own home, (or if I am convinced that I ought to have a home 
as a man, but as a minister, for the sake of the gospel, deny myself the ful- 
filment of this desire), then let me be active in the obtaining of homes for 
my neighbors. 
How may we ministers help in the establishment of the people in homes of 
their own? 
1. By teaching the doctrine in our pulpits. We can, as I have shown, 
preach this as a part of the will of God for us men. We, and WE ONLY, 
can give to this question of home-ownership, the highest moral sanction. 
Others, statesmen and economists, may proclaim it on the ground of ea- 
pediency. It is reserved to us to proclaim it on the ground of right. Let us 
declare to all the people that God would have every man not only with a home 
in heaven, but with a home also here upon this present earth. 
2. By conversation among the people. Let us tell the land-holder that he 
ought to sell to the man who wishes to establish a home, even at the cost of 
inconvenience and sacrifice to himself. Let us so master this whole ques- 
tion as to show the advantages of home-ownership to the community and to 
the individual. Let us be brave enough to warn the avaricious landlord that 
he refuses to sell at his own peril, and the peril of his children and the peril 
of his class. We may encourage the tenant, on the other hand, to buy, laying 
upon him the duty of acquiring his home for his own sake, for his children’s 
sake, and for the community’s best interest. Let us have the facts and figures, 
so that we can place before him the entire feasibility of his becoming owner 
rather than tenant. Let us help him to make all necessary arrangements, 
by recommending him to the owner who will sell, by finding for him those 
who will lend; in short, by showing ourselves as really interested in getting 
men to possess a title to a plain and humble home here, as we are in getting 
them to acquire a title to a mansion in the skies. 
Above all, we must practice what we preach, and what we believe. 
A good many of us have property that we have bought or have inherited. 
We ministers must set the example to other men in this country; we must
-P-A-G-E-180
  
  176 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
ourselves anticipate legislation by selling of our lands to persons for homes 
on terms that approach those methods that experience has proven to be wise 
and practicable. I do not believe our people either understand, or are willing 
to adopt, the long amortization plans in vogue in Europe, but they do know 
that a long time is required to dig the payment of a piece of land out of the 
ground itself, and they do understand that an asset like land ought to bear 
a different rate of interest from an asset like cotton, or other perishable stuff. 
May I tell just what I have done? I have recently sold two tracts of land 
on these terms: I required the payment of only $15 each, as earnest money 
till January 1, 1915, then on lands whose purchase price aggregated over 
$4,000 for each tract, I have required the payment of not more than $350, 
have allowed ten and fifteen years to complete the payments, and have 
required interest at only six per cent. Some men may scoff, and tell me 
that I am a fool in business. That may be so, from the viewpoint of cold and 
simple business, but looking at the arrangement from every point of view, 
I am sure it is not only good business, but good Christianity as well. If I 
can mix business and Christianity a little more, and get you to do it, too, 
I am well content. 
Permit me to offer two practical suggestions for the church: 
1. Why may not the church, either organized as a denomination or else 
through the local church, assist its worthy members, especially its young men, 
to acquire homes of their own? 
I am told that the Mormon, the Catholic and the Mennonite assist their 
people to buy lands. May we not learn something from them? Also I am 
informed that the Northern Presbyterian Church is buying land in Georgia 
to sell to colored people. If it is a part of the plan of that church to assist 
negroes to own their homes, I would inquire if every reason does not impel 
it to assist its own people in the same way? If it is right for that church to 
do it, it is right and proper for all the rest of us. 
2. Why may not the church loan its vested funds, its seminary and college 
endowments, its funds held by its various boards in trust, to its own people 
for this purpose? As it is now, we have the church’s funds loaned on mort- 
gages of city real estate, invested in stocks and bonds of all sorts; sometimes 
even in property rented to saloons and houses of ill fame. Why may not 
these funds be loaned through these same boards to the people on first mort- 
gage of farms? I do not believe the income of these vested funds would be 
materially reduced. I am sure their security would remain unimpaired. 
And to offset any small reduction in the rate of interest, we would have a large 
number of young men tied to the church with the strongest feelings of love 
and affection, as to the institution that had proved itself a friend in need and 
in deed. 
But more than all else, when the church does this, or something like it, 
then it will be itself practicing the truth its Bible teaches. It will be helping 
in a more concrete way the advance of that day when the will of God shall 
be done on earth, as it is in heaven. It will usher in, perhaps, the very salva- 
tion of the country church, and the tenant farmer. 
May God grant to each of us to work for the right as he sees it, for the 
glory of God, and the happiness of his fellow man,
-P-A-G-E-181
  PREACHERS’ CONFERENCE 177 
THE TENANT PROBLEM. 
W. W. Long, of Clemson College, South Carolina. 
In order to discuss intelligently the tenant problem in the south, one finds 
it impossible to do so without discussing, at the same time, the race problem. 
Nearly half of the farm lands in South Carolina are in the hands of colored 
farmers, as tenants or share-croppers. A condition similar to this exists in 
most of the southern States, though the percentage is not generally as great. 
Considering this situation, it is plain that no people can afford to have one- 
half, or even one-fourth of all their farm lands in the hands of a class of people 
unskilled in the care of land, or the production of profit from it. When we 
consider that every acre of farmed land that does not produce a paying 
crop means so much loss to the wealth of a State or a section, we realize that 
the state of affairs now existing is intolerable. 
But we have the negro here, and we shall always have him here. There 
are 9,000,000 of him in the south today, nearly one-third of our total popu- 
lation. We cannot get him off of our lands now, and we shall never be able 
to get him off—at any rate, not for many, many years. Let us get that settled 
in our minds at once and allow it to give us no further concern. It is only 
the short-sighted man in the south who talks of getting rid of the negroes. 
What, therefore, is the logical course for our people to take? We have on 
our hands and our lands an enormous number of ignorant negro farmers, 
who are there, so far as we can tell now, to stay. To a sensible, logical people, 
the only answer is that we must make the negro a better farmer. Just here 
I desire to say that I shall not discuss this question from the humanitarian 
standpoint, but from the white man’s standpoint: And so I say, we must 
make the negro a better farmer, not, if you please, because humanitarian 
principles demand it of us, but in order to protect and benefit ourselves and 
our children. 
If making the negro a better farmer is going to mean educating him, let 
us educate him. If it means renting our lands to him for a term of years, 
let us rent him our lands for a term of years. If it means giving him cheaper 
money, and not endeavoring to squeeze out of him usuriously every dollar 
that we can, let us give him cheaper money. If it means treating the negro 
fairly and honestly, let us be fair and honest with him. And since I believe 
that making the negro a better farmer will require these four changes of 
attitude on the part of our people, I shall limit myself to discussing these 
four things in the order in which I have named them, which I believe to be 
the logical order of the negro farmer’s betterment at the hands of our white 
people. 
I have always believed in negro education. I have heard it said, and be- 
lieve it to be true, that you can knock a man down and keep him down by 
sitting on him. But just as long as you sit on him you will be unable to get 
up yourself. This seems to me to be our situation with respect to the negro. 
Those who oppose educating the negro on the ground that it might lead to 
something like social equality, or an attempt at it, can hold the negro down 
so long as they wish to. But they have to stay down with him. The wisdom
-P-A-G-E-182
  178 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
of the sages and the experience of the ages assure us beyond cavil that ig- 
norance is detrimental to a community, no matter in what portion of the 
community ignorance may exist. The south can never achieve its destiny 
until it has reduced its present enormous percentage of illiteracy. It can 
never do this until it educates its negroes. 
When the white people of the south squarely face the fact that they will 
have to educate the negro, and leave off quibbling about it, much of our prob- 
Jem will have been solved. I do not believe in giving him the same educa- 
tion that a white child receives. This would not be practicable, anyway, 
because of his, at this time, inferior order of intellect. But educate him in the 
rudiments of culture, train him to do useful work, inculcate in him the funda- 
mentals of right living, make him, by practical and sensible means, a decent 
citizen. 
The next point I wish to make, is that in order to make the negro a better 
farmer, we shall have to make radical changes in our present tenant system. 
At present our lands are being robbed of their fertility and future usefulness 
by shiftless, short-term tenants to whom we have offered no inducements to 
improye our lands. Why should he improve the land he plants? He knows 
that the chances are that at the end of the year he will be turned off and 
another tenant taken in his place, or the land taken over by the owner. And 
if he improves the soil by planting legumes or by other methods, he fears, 
and rightly, that the landlord will raise the rent of the land because of the 
improvement the tenant has made on it. It is not possible, under present 
conditions, to make the negro tenant use proper agricultural methods. 
In the low counties of South Carolina, men have given their tenants fertilizers 
and made them promise to use them, have given them cowpeas for planting, 
and made them promise to use them, and the tenants have sold the materials 
furnished them and kept the money. 
But I believe there is a solution to this problem, and not a very difficult 
one either. Let us lease land to the negro for a term of, say, five years, mak- 
ing a binding contract with him to permit him to stay on the land for this 
length of time, without any increase in rental, provided he will plant winter 
cover crops and use other soil-building methods, which must be set forth in 
the contract. Make an agreement in the contract further, that at the end 
of five years the tenant will have the option of re-renting the land for another 
term of years at a reasonable increase in rental. I believe that if the farmers 
of the south will do this, it will benefit our lands and increase the community 
wealth to an extent impossible now for us to estimate. 
But having rented. the land to him on equitable terms and having made 
provisions which will permit him to become a good farmer and our lands 
to become better lands, shall we destroy what we have done by refusing to 
let him have money except at a ruinous rate of interest? If the white farmer 
rises in arms against the man who wishes to charge him ten and twelve per 
cent. for money, what must be the feeling of the negro who has to pay the 
enormous rates which the majority of our people are guilty of charging him? 
It is little to be wondered that he does not care to do anything to improve his 
landlord’s place. Such usage is not calculated to make men feel kindly toward 
those who use them so. Let us therefore make up our minds once and for all 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
  
PREACHERS’ CONFERENCE 179 
time that an essential step in solving the negro problem is the changing of our 
system of loaning him money, and let us give him money on the same terms 
on which white farmers receive it. 
These are the-two main steps, leasing land for a term of years and letting 
the negro have money cheaply. As for our fourth requirement, that of treat- 
ing the negro fairly and honestly, when we have educated him, given him a 
reasonably permanent tenure on our soil, and dealt with him equitably 
in financial matters, we shall be able to claim with reason that we have ful- 
filled this fourth requirement. 
Before concluding my discussion on this question, I wish to say, and I 
believe it to be directly germane to the tenant problem in its larger phases, 
that I am very strongly opposed to negro ownership of land. As I said when 
I began, I am not discussing this matter from the broadest point of view, 
but purely from the standpoint of the white man’s best interests. The owner- 
ship of land is the very basis and foundation of this and all other civilizations. 
If the negro is allowed to continue to acquire land at the rate he is now ac- 
quiring it, nay, if he continues to be driven to acquire land by a tenant system 
that offers the smallest possible gain, the devotees of the present system and 
those who oppose negro education may then well fear social equality. 
In the State of Virginia in 1910, sixty-seven per cent. of the negro farmers 
owned their own lands, the increase in negro ownership being twenty-one 
per cent. from 1900 to 1910. In the twenty-four tidewater counties of Vir- 
ginia, negro land holdings have increased in fifty years from about 5,000 
acres to 421,465 acres. The total acreage of lands in Virginia owned by negroes 
in 1910 was 1,629,626; in Arkansas, of 215,000 farmers, 64,000 were negroes, 
and of these 64,000 about 16,000 owned their own farms. The percentages 
for other States may be even higher, and in some cases probably are. Figures 
for these two, however, suffice to show that it is no mere possibility that we 
face, but an actual situation. 
The negro knows that the acquisition of land is the surest way for him to 
raise himself to the level of the white man. If he does not know it, his leaders 
know it, and instruct him in the ways that he should go. We find, for ex- 
ample, that Booker T. Washington, and other leading negroes, are con- 
stantly urging upon their people the importance of buying land. Further- 
more, you will find that when a negro buys a piece of land, as a general thing, 
he will starve himself and his family for years in order to secure a clear title 
and pay off his mortgages. He will pay for land with a willingness and a 
persistence that he shows in no other transaction. And, when he has ac- 
quired the land, he will not let it go. This tenacity is going to be one cause 
of our future trouble if we continue to sell him land. 
I know that many people consider me hopelessly inconsistent when they 
hear me on the one hand plead for education and fairer and more honest treat- 
ment of the negro, and on the other hand, set myself up in opposition to the 
acquisition of land by the negro. They will argue that it is impossible to 
make first-class tenant farmers of the negroes without inspiring them with a 
desire to own land, causing them ultimately to demand that land be sold to 
them. They will argue that it is impossible to prevent negroes from buying  
-P-A-G-E-184
  180 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
land if they wish to do so. Let us see whether these objections will hold 
water. 
As for the first objection, we have our answer in England, where for cen- 
turies a certain class of people owned practically no land. The great landed 
estates were in the hands of a few, and the lands were parcelled out among 
the tenantry. Yet the tenants became good farmers and made good farmers 
of their sons, and it was 1,000 years or more before they began seriously to 
insist that the government require the gentry to sell land to them. If it 
took the sturdy, intelligent British yeomanry 1,000 years to bring to a head 
their demands to be allowed to own land, would it not require a longer time 
for the negro to reach this point? I admit that my plan might leave a problem 
for the far distant future, but perhaps in a thousand years the negro may 
be so different a being that the problem will solve itself naturally. At any 
rate, who are we that we shall endeavor to plan for the people of many cen- 
turies ahead? Shall we not content ourselves rather with doing what we con- 
sider to be for the best interests of our posterity only so far ahead as we can 
imagine our posterity? 
It is true you cannot legislate the negro out of land ownership. It would 
not do any good to pass such laws, even were they constitutional, unless the 
sentiment of the community were overwhelmingly against negro ownership 
of land. But once you have secured this sentiment, you need no legislation. 
So it is plain, that if we educate the public mind to the dangers of the 
acquisition of land by negroes, we shall need no laws on the subject. The 
instinct of self-preservation runs with as much virility and strength in a 
community as in an individual, and but allow the mind of the community 
to become sufficiently impressed with the danger of anything that threatens 
its civilization, and the community will turn against that thing, and will 
battle with it single-handed, no matter what may be the odds against it. 
And so it will be with the white people of the south. 
Let us recapitulate. When all is said and done, we owe the negro a debt, 
and the negro owes us a debt, and this mutual debt is permanent and can never 
perhaps be fully liquidated. The presence of the negro in such large numbers 
as tenants on southern farms has given us a problem which stands in the way 
of our agricultural advancement. I believe that the proper method of solving 
this problem is educating the negro, leasing him land for a term of years 
with the privilege of re-renting it, and letting him have money cheaply and 
on equitable terms. I further believe that we should so encourage the negro 
to become a good and contented tenant farmer, that he will not insist on 
buying land when we make up our minds not to sell it to him. 
All that I have suggested here as advisable for our white people to do 
has been suggested strictly from the point of view of the interests of the white 
race. But we find that nearly all of these suggestions are also in the interest 
of the negro race. Certainly, if these methods were to be put into operation 
our conduct would be very much more in accord with humanitarian practice 
that it is at present. If we do not allow the negro to acquire land, it is because 
there is a point beyond which a race is not required, even by moral laws, to 
go. Freedom in land ownership would ultimately place the negro socially 
on a level with the white man, and the white race would suffer substantial —
-P-A-G-E-185
  PREACHERS’ CONFERENCE 181 
deterioration because of this. No moral law or any other kind of law requires 
a race to jeopardize its future integrity. 
Finally, it is my belief that if we fail to do the things which I have recom- 
mended, we shall have to do them later, or our children will have to do them 
when the doing may be much more difficult than it is now. It is my ardent 
hope, therefore, that we can convince the white man in the south of the per- 
manence of the negro tenant problem, and influence him to take those steps 
which will be for his own interests and will at the same time, permit him to 
fulfil the debt and the duty which he owes to the negro race. 
TuHuRsDAY, APRIL 9. 
Thursday morning Prof. J. F. Smith, of Berea College, Kentucky, was 
introduced. He told of the plans of Berea College to train men for the country 
church, by taking the situation as it is, and adapting religion to the country 
as education is adapted. He spoke also of the institute held in Rowan county, 
Ky., for the ministers. Fifteen ministers formed the first organization. 
They agreed to work together for night schools, good roads, a better agricul- 
ture and better day schools. A county-wide organization with about forty 
ministers has grown from this beginning. 
Prof. G. S. Gardner, D. D., of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, 
of Louisville, presided. Professor Gardner emphasized the fact that the 
country church has the function of vitalizing community spirit and indicated 
that life must be considered as one great whole and must serve all in the 
community. The vital interest is for the solidarity of community life. 
Dr. C. H. Young next presented the topic, “Is the Church Developing 
Character?” His main point was the essential of co-ordinating the laws 
of nature with the laws of character-buliding and deplored the fact that so 
much machinery is precipitated for carrying on any effort which complicates 
and invalidates the very purpose for which the effort was ordained. He 
deplored that this overhead machinery aspect was too much the spirit of the 
age. He declared emphatically that the great need today was the develop- 
ment of personality and leadership, and that the problem of character-build- 
ing is the problem of developing personality. 
Dr. Lord, of the Methodist Church, South, next took up the question 
of a periodical which has been widely distributed, entitled “Our Country.” 
He explained that this apparently innocent and interesting agricultural 
periodical was an instrument of the liquor interest and indicated how the liquor 
interest presented their cause in every issue in some pointed article in which 
they attempted to counteract the prohibition movement. He declared that 
it was a shrewd move on the part of the liquor element to reach the country 
folk. 
There were other discussions following Dr. Young’s able presentation, 
in which some such points were made as these: That people were working 
too much for the Lord instead of knowing how to work with the Lord. Another 
emphasis was placed upon the need of individuals finding their places in 
special tasks. That in order to build character there must be motive. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  
182 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
another instance one of the speakers emphasized the need of home life in the 
process of character building. 
The Rev. O. O. Green next presented an able paper on ‘Rural Evan- 
gelism.” He emphasized the need of a specially trained ministry, an organ- 
ization which will be adequate to meet the needs of the rural folk. The presi- 
dent of the Theological Seminary of Columbia, 8. C., ventured to make the 
statement that there was a need of the ministry taking a definite course in 
rural sociology if they would be effective in country districts and indicated 
his readiness to adopt means and measures whereby such a rural sociologist 
will soon occupy a chair at his seminary. 
The afternoon was spent most profitably and there were some very de- 
cided contributions made in the discussions which were accepted most en- 
thusiastically by those present and the emphasis of the meeting was to resume 
the discussions after the meeting was closed. 
Fripay, Aprin 10. 
The principal subject was the question of the home and the Christian 
family. The Rev. Edwin F. Goodson, of Morganfield, presided and in 
his introductory remarks, made some pertinent points on the question of 
recovering the fundamentals that may have become overshadowed by our 
complex civilization for the building of community life. 
Dr. Thomas, of Louisville, also made his contribution by some interesting 
remarks. 
Dr. Wilson, of the Presbyterian board of missions, department of church 
and country life, made a most encompassing presentation of the problem 
of the country church and the rural community.

, INTENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORK. 
Jno. A. Ferrell, M. D., The Rockefeller Sanitary Commission, Washington, D. C. 
Intensive community health work, once soundly established, will amply 
compensate for its cost in time and money. The people are ready for it. 
They are beginning to believe in sanitation; in preventive measures for pro- 
tection against sickness and death. The difficulty is that this belief can be 
confirmed and deepened into an abiding faith only by intensive health work. 
The work must come close to the people; they must make some sacrifices 
to have it; and then they must see some practical results. The State health 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
    184 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
department is indispensable; the county health organization is of great im- 
portance, but the ultimate victory must be achieved by intensive health work 
that will leave no stone unturned. 
The place to make a demonstration in intensive health work is in the 
country, not only because our most important health problem concerns the 
rural population, but because in the open country we can find the best op- 
portunity for a successful experiment.. In the country we can find a place 
where there are enough people, but not too many; where there will be some 
communication with other communities, but not too much; where, in short, 
we can keep the subjects of our experiment sufficiently isolated so that we 
and they may know accurately and definitely what has been the result. 
In selecting a country community for an experiment we are justified 
in selecting a community where the results will be particularly striking, 
on the same principle whereby agriculturists test their seeds in exceptionally 
fertile soil before sowing them over the “average.” The community should 
be a farming community made up of thrifty people who are willing to learn 
new things, and if the new things are good, able to pay for them. It should 
be one where health conditions are not the best, in order that the results 
may stand out all the more conspicuously by comparison. It should be 
more or less secluded from the surrounding territory, in order that the danger 
from transmission of disease by travel may be minimized. For some reasons 
a small island would be ideal, but in any event a community with a natural 
rather than an arbitrary boundary, would be preferable. In the average 
rural district the community for demonstration purposes ought not to be 
more than twenty or thirty square milesin area, and with a population of about 
2,000, since that is a safe number of persons for one health officer to look 
after. 
The community selected for intensive work should have, or we should 
help to develop within it, a model school with a strong teaching force composed 
of teachers who would throw themselves zealously into the campaign for 
making the community ideal in its provision for good health. Our activities 
would then centre around the school. It would also be desirable, if practicable, 
to select a community that forms an integral part of a county already possess- 
ing an efficient department of health. 
When the community where the work is to be done has been selected, there 
are several important points in the method of procedure that need to be con- 
sidered. In the first place, the community itself must ask that the work 
be begun. Leading citizens within the community should be inspired to take 
the initiative in outlining plans. They should bring together in mass-meeting 
the residents of the community. The meeting should adopt resolutions calling 
on the State board of health, or the county health department, if there be 
one, to lend a helping hand in carrying out the tentative plans. In each suc- 
cessive step a large amount of spontaneity is essential; the people must show 
that they themselves want the work done. 
The next thing is to choose a health officer who will devote his whole time 
and energy to the work. What is everybody’s business is nobody’s business; 
and community health work to be properly done, must be done by a man 
who gives his whole time to it. This health officer should be a medical
-P-A-G-E-189
  
Country Doctors’ CONFERENCE 185 
graduate, with a good, liberal education besides; he should be possessed of 
a strong personality, resourceful, energetic, tactful, sympathetic and yet 
firm. He should come to know every man, woman and child in the com- 
munity; to win their love, confidence, and esteem. He must be well paid for 
his services. If possible the health officer should have the assistance of a 
nurse, who is also skilled in the use of the microscope. She would be of special 
value in work with the women and girls of the community. 
Before actually beginning the work, maps should be made showing the 
location of every home in the community, and also every school, church, 
store, etc. Each building should be given a number to correspond to numbers 
on the survey record sheets. These maps would be incidental to a complete 
and exhaustive sanitary survey of the community. It is important to know 
what the health problem is when the work begins and what progress has been 
made at different stages. This survey would show the sanitary conditions 
in and around every dwelling in the community; the type of privy, condition 
of the well, etc. 
There should also be a complete infection survey, showing all infections 
of hookworm disease, malaria, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and other diseases. 
This survey would include a clinical history of every individual in the com- 
munity, and these individual histories would be grouped into those of families. 
In the meantime the health officer would be at work showing the people 
that these surveys were solely in the interest of the good health of the people 
in this particular community. The nurse, assuming that there is one, would 
be visiting homes, helping in the survey, and talking with the women and 
girls. It might be found desirable at this time to encourage more rapid progress 
in the building of sanitary privies by having some carpenter specially skilled 
in constructing them go from house to house, and render assistance in putting 
up new privies or improving the old ones. 
If the movement is properly directed the people will respond. It is the 
province of the intensive method to do with ease that which seems otherwise 
too difficult to do at all. The case of Knott’s Island is suggestive of the 
possibilities. Knott’s Island is located in the sound on the east coast of North 
Carolina. It has a population of 520 white persons, living in 120 families. 
It employs a whole-time community physician. Each family pays one dollar 
a month for his services, so that he receives $1,440 a year, besides special 
fees for certain surgical and other services. This assessment is purely volun- 
tary, and the prime reason for the arrangement is that the people of the island 
might otherwise be without an available competent physician. This physician 
was employed as a physician, and not as a sanitarian; yet he has done valuable 
work in the sanitary development of Knott’s Island. 
In the work on Knott’s Island there was no authority to compel all the 
families to co-operate. The whole plan was voluntary. In the campaign 
against hookworm disease all the inhabitants except two were examined, 
and all of those found infected were treated except two. Although this in 
itself was an exceptional piece of work, it demonstrates that the clean-up 
campaign failed to be perfect because of lack of authority; it could not bring 
in the four persons remaining of the whole 520. 
This might have been remedied in one of three ways: First, the community
-P-A-G-E-190
  186 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
might have incorporated itself; and as an incorporation have passed commun- 
ity ordinances somewhat similar in character to those governing small towns. 
Second, the county board of health might have passed rules and regulations 
for the county, and have delegated authority for their enforcement to the 
community physician. Third, legal provision might have been made.for the 
formation of special tax sanitary districts, so that the people might levy a 
property tax sufficient to replace the voluntary assessment paid to the physi- 
cian. This sanitary district would have the authority that always goes 
with the expenditure of public money for public purposes, compelling the 
few to acquiesce for the good of the many. 
The Knott’s Island experience gives us authority for intensive work in a 
rural community, but it also warns us that to be successful we must not 
depend on voluntary contributions of money, nor on voluntary co-operation 
of individuals. We may secure the money that way, and we may reach the 
most people that way, but the burden will not be equitably distributed, 
nor can we reach the few who may still endanger the health of all the other 
people. 
It may be necessary in the beginning to rely on voluntary aid, but the 
amount used must be as small as is practicable in proportion to that supplied 
by the community, and it must be depended on no longer than is really 
necessary. If it is ever to go beyond the experimental stage, the work must 
not only be self-supporting, it must be actually profitable. 
North Carolina now has a law permitting separate communities to form 
themselves into special-tax sanitary districts, and to levy upon themselves 
taxes for health work. Such districts will be formed, no doubt, under the 
permission of the statute, and such taxes will be levied and collected. But 
if the work does not produce results the taxes will fall into abeyance, and the 
whole scheme will fail. This is a further indication that the time is ripe for 
experimental work, which will set a precedent and a standard for the guidance 
of districts eager to lead in the health movement. 
It has been estimated that the sanitary work in the Canal Zone cost $12 
per capita per year. The people on Knott’s Island pay nearly $2.25 each for 
their community physician. Suppose a community such as we have been 
thinking about has 2,000 people, who would impose a property tax for health 
purposes that would amount to $4,000 a year, or $2 per capita. That would 
permit them to pay $2,500 to a health officer, and $1,200 a year to a nurse; 
and they could get good ones for those salaries. Three hundred dollars 
would then be left for contingent expenses. 
To be rid of hookworm disease and typhoid fever, to be armed against 
malaria and tuberculosis, to have the physical defects of children corrected, 
to live in better health and more comfort, and with greater security—surely 
any neighborhood would gladly pay the price.

THE COMMUNITY ASPECT OF THE HEALTH PROBLEM. 
W. S. Rankin, M. D., Secretary North Carolina State Board of Health. 
VinwPoint. 
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
In accordance with the dominant thought of this Conference, I shall speak 
briefly on the community aspect of the health problem. 
Any attempt to construct community life that neglects the health factor, 
is like unto the attempt of the foolish man who built his house upon the sand; 
health is fundamental. To borrow a significant term from the eugenist, health 
is the determiner of microscopic life, of cellular life, of multi-cellular or in- 
dividual life, and of multi-individual or social life. 
In entering upon the new problem of social health, we pass from the mi- 
croscopie study of the health of the cellular organism to the telescopic study 
of the health of the social organism—from the miniature health picture of the 
individual body to the enlarged health picture of the body politic. As many 
important principles of treatment have been established by experiments 
on the lower animals, so there are many lessons which we may carry over from 
the smaller and older field of individual therapeutics to the larger and newer 
field of social therapeutics. 
EXAMINATION. 
One of the most important of these lessons is that which teaches the neces- 
sity of a careful, methodical, and complete examination preliminary to any 
attempt at treatment. By knowing and recording the actual vital condition 
of a subject before treatment, we may recognize later the resultant changes 
in our subject’s condition and measure thereby the effectiveness or ineffective- 
ness of the treatment administered. The examination must be methodical 
and complete, as in that way we avoid overlooking conditions which may, 
at the time of examination, appear insignificant, but which may prove later 
to be of great value; therefore, as a physician in examining an individual 
follows a regular order and records his findings on standard history and 
physical examination blanks, so those who propose to treat the community 
body politic should make a thorough community examination or survey and 
record it preliminary to the application of social remedies. 
Survey. 
The community survey should be made by someone who has given consider- 
able study to community health problems, probably some representative 
of the State board of health or some philanthropic organization, such as 
the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission, assisted by a committee representing the 
community under examination. The survey following represents the ideas 
of a group of North Carolina community students with reference to the 
scope of the examination.

11. Sanrrary InpEx Community, Score-Carp Meruop: 
A superficial glance at this survey may suggest that its scope is too broad 
—that much of an irrelevant nature has been included. So the layman would 
be impressed in glancing over the history and physical examination chart of 
a patient who had been examined by a first-class physician. Just as the 
physician in dealing with the individual body takes into account not only the 
positive symptoms with obvious meaning, but, also the vaguely suggestive 
and indefinite symptoms, so in dealing with the community body politic, 
our survey should include not only those factors with direct and positive 
bearing on health conditions, but also those factors with an indirect and remote 
bearing on the community health problem. It is better that the survey be 
too broad than too narrow. 
Without going into too much detail I wish to point out the general sig- 
nificance of the principal groups of items, and the special significance of cer- 
tain items of the survey: Items one to eight, taken together, indicate the
-P-A-G-E-195
  Country Doctors’ CONFERENCE 191 
extent of the community spirit—the factor that makes the community work 
possible; items nine to eleven, inclusive, indicate the health condition of 
the community—the factor that shows the need of community health work. 
Taken in smaller groups, the items have a more specific meaning: Items one 
and two indicate the facilities for getting around in the community—the 
ease with which the community units may come into touch—the community 
circulation; item three shows community ability to respond to a recognized 
need—community nutrition; items four and five indicate community sus- 
ceptibility to occupational diseases; item six indicates community intelligence; 
. item seven, community morals; item eight, the community recreational life, 
the youthfulness or senility of the community mind, and, if the latter, the 
seriousness, despondency, nervousness, suicidal and insane tendency of the 
community mind. 
The special significance, with reference to community health, of items 
nine and ten, warrant fuller treatment than I have given the preceding items. 
The significance of item nine is favorable to community health work 
when one ethical physician controls eighty per cent. or more of the community 
practice; unfavorable if the physician is unethical, because he will be unable 
to secure consultation from outside physicians; unfavorable again, if there 
is a division of community practice between two or more physicians, as this 
condition would engender dangerous friction and community differences in 
the selection of a community physician. In developing community work in 
this country, we should be careful to select, as our early demonstration com- 
munities, those communities where item nine is favorable. 
On arriving at item ten in the survey, we come to the very heart of the 
community health problem. Item ten furnishes the vital statistics of the 
community, the prima facie evidence of community health or community 
disease. There are vital phenomena or symptoms of the body politic as 
definite, as well-marked and as full of meaning as are the vital phenomena 
or symptoms of the individual body. For example: In the rise or fall of the 
general death rate, as in the rise and fall of the pulse wave, we have an index 
to the general vitality of the body politic; in the rise or fall of the tuberculosis 
death rate, as in the number and character of respiratory movements, we 
have an index to the air consumption and sunshine exposure of a community 
or body politic; in the typhoid death rate, as long ago pointed out by Dr. 
Osler, we have a true index to community cleanliness; in the rise or fall of the 
death rate from contagious diseases, we have a true index to the efficiency 
of the community quarantine; in the death rate of infants under two years 
of age, we have a true index to the maternal intelligence of the community. 
The sick or morbidity rates, while not as absolute in their meaning as the 
death or mortality rates, furnish evidence of great confirmatory value with 
the death rates and indicate in no uncertain manner the vital influences 
at work in a community. However, let: us remember that all sickness, from 
the slightest to the most marked departure from health, moves always from 
life toward death, and ultimately finds its expression on the debit side of the 
health chart in the column marked “death rates.” 
Based upon United States census reports and the work of the Committee 
of One Hundred, we would find in the average community of from twenty- 
   
-P-A-G-E-196
  192 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
five to thirty square miles, where live from 300 to 350 families numbering a 
total population of from 1,500 to 2,000 (and there are many such commun- 
ities in this State and in the south), from twenty-two to thirty deaths and a* 
total of from 16,000 to 20,000 days of sickness each year. Accepting Irving 
Fisher’s estimate of the economic value of the average American ($1,700), 
this loss converted into the coinage of the realm means a loss of $374,000 to 
$510,000 annually. This does not include the financial loss of from 16,000 
to 20,000 days of time, doctors’ bills, undertakers’ bills, ete., which would, 
at a most conservative estimate, add from $30,000 to $50,000 to the loss in 
vital assets. In that community there are from three to five cases of typhoid 
fever each year costing the families a total of from $200 to $500; there are 
six to eight cases of active tuberculosis costing the families from $400 to $600; 
thirty of the ninety babies under two years of age are sick each year with 
summer complaint, and the treatment of these children cost at least $500 a 
year; there are from forty to fifty births a year with a cost in obstetrical fees 
of from $500 to $750 a year. From the evidence of the survey and from the 
condition of the average community, it will be evident that the next step in 
dealing with this problem of community health should be— 
‘TREATMENT. 
The first step in a remedial direction should be the selection of a health 
committee composed of both sexes, and representing in the location of their 
homes all sections of the community. 
The health committee, assisted by a temporary consultant from the board 
of health should lay the foundation for community health work both broad 
and deep: Broad in the sense of a comprehensive plan that will embody both 
the prevention and cure of disease, the work of health officer and physician 
combined. Here we come upon the most important distinction between 
community health work and county, municipal, and State health work. In 
the wider field of county, State or municipality, the health officer will restrict 
his activities to prevention; in the narrower field of a community, where there 
is not enough work for a physician and an health officer, a more comprehensive 
plan of health conservation—prevention and cure—will be centered in one 
man, and, for this reason, the foundation for the solution of the community 
health problem should be broad. It should be deep in the sense of permanency, 
and nine-tenths of the permanency of the work of the health committee will 
consist in having a thorough understanding, in the very beginning, with the 
local physician of just what is to be attempted. Unless this is practicable, 
some other community where it is practicable had better be chosen, not for 
the experiment, but for the demonstration. One of the most fundamental 
mistakes that the health committee can make would be to ignore the local 
physician or to deny him participation in planning the health work of his 
practice and community, or for the committee to deliberately conceal from 
the physician their true and ultimate purpose. Such a mistake would, in 
many instances, result sooner or later in dangerous opposition to the whole 
community scheme from the community physician—one of the most potent 
community influences.
-P-A-G-E-197
Country Doctors’ CONFERENCE 193 
The relation of the health committee to the community physician and to 
the consultant from the board of health or other organization should be under- 
stood clearly. The health committee should be the community board of 
health. To them for approval, should be submitted all the plans and pro- 
grams for community health improvements. They should select, determine 
the compensation of, and fix the duties of a community physician. The 
community physician should not be a member of the health committee, as 
in all likelihood it will be necessary for the committee to employ him as their 
executive officer. Where it is impossible for a health committee to ultimately 
use the community physician in this capacity, it would be well in most in- 
stances, for the community promoters, this Conference and their disciples, 
to withdraw and select some other community where such an arrangement 
can be made. The borrowed community organizer from the board of health 
should follow the precedent of consultant to physician, of consulting health 
officer to State or local health officer, by working with and under the com- 
munity physician. This will prevent friction and.will permit the gradual 
transfer of the organized community health work to a permanent local ad- 
ministration, after which the borrowed community organizer may seek new 
fields and pastures green. Having secured the community doctor, the next 
item in the order of consideration is the— 
ADMINISTRATION OF REMEDIES. 
The most important method for administering remedies to the social 
organism, is the intracranious or educational method. 
The physician should procure the approval of the school committee and 
the health committee for him to direct, or, better, conduct the school course 
on sanitation and hygiene. This course should be extremely practical and 
equally entertaining. These specifications do not require that anatomy 
and physiology be taught. They do require that the physician, two hours a 
week, should take the health class out into the fields, around the barns and 
about the homes, and there, out of the book that God wrote with His own hand 
—the book of nature— show the children the different stages of mosquito 
life, the differences between the malarial and non-malarial mosquito, the 
different stages of fly life, the fly under the magnifying glass and under the 
microscope, the malarial parasite under the microscope, the actual germs 
of disease in culture tubes, on agar plates and on stained slides, which have 
been loaned by the State laboratory of hygiene; they require that he shall 
show, by simple bacteriologic methods intelligent to the child mind, how 
germs are transferred from mouths to cups and from cups to other mouths, 
and how germs are disseminated through the room in acts of coughing or 
sneezing. Let the community physician teach the subject of health in this 
way, and he will make health the chief topic of conversation and interest 
in the homes, and verily a little child shall lead that community into the 
temple of Hygeia, where they shall be made whole. 
Let the community physician add to this educational course for the children 
a supplementary course for the parents, the distribution of health bulletins 
to the community homes, and let him provide for at least half a dozen illus- 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
194 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
trated health lectures to be given in the community each year either by him- 
self or some invited sanitarian. He can extend the educational work and 
secure community co-operation in health matters by interesting the ministers 
who preach in the community in the relation of the church to the problem of 
disease, in the meaning of Christ’s spending a great deal of his time in caring 
for the sick. 
The community physician will extend this educational work and make it 
of a more direct and personal nature by opening a dispensary for the free 
examination and treatment of any member of the community. Here he will 
be able to detect diseases in their incipiency, and, by prompt treatment, delay 
their progress or cause their removal, in this way postponing death and 
saving the older part of the population to their children for many years of 
training and influence. The opportunities open to the community physician 
are so numerous and so promising, that it is with difficulty that I resist fur- 
ther pursuance of this phase of the subject, and hasten on to point out a few 
of the important results that would be accomplished through this work. 
In that community (a) there need be practically no flies; (b) with the going 
of the fly and general vaccination against typhoid, typhoid fever would 
disappear; (c) with vaccination against smallpox, there would be no more 
smallpox; (d) with the education of people as to the cause of malaria and the 
general adoption of minimum and unappreciable doses of quinine for three 
or four months in the year, malaria would go; (e) the enlightenment of the 
community with reference to the nature of contagious diseases would result 
in the enforcement of quarantine, and contagion would be decreased to a 
. minimum, and schools would go on uninterfered with; (f) anti-tuberculosis 
work would be organized, and consumptives cared for; (g) mothers’ clubs 
would study infant hygiene and’ much more than half the children of that 
community would reach twenty-one years of age, and much less than one- 
third of them would be buried before they were five years of age; (h) the dis- 
pensary would keep the community drugs, which could be had at cost, and the 
community physician would arrange with a competent surgeon for the sur- 
gical work of the community at a minimum figure, combining in these ways 
efficiency with economy. Any new discovery or new methods of handling 
diseases could be carried to and demonstrated to the community physician 
by a central bureau of the State board of health. Example: important 
changes in the method of feeding infants, discovered after a community phy- 
sician had left a hospital, could be sent to and taught to him through an agent 
of the central board, so the work of this community physician and the State 
board of health would be mutually helpful. As a net result of this work, a 
survey made twelve months after its beginning would show such a decrease 
in’ both morbidity and mortality rates as would demonstrate to other com- 
munities the economy in money and the saving of human life of this kind of 
work. 
A final word in regard to a phase of the disease problem that is too often 
overlooked, viz.,

I mention this phase of the problem, not so much on the doctor’s account, 
as to point out what seems to me likely to be the profoundest influence 
that this work may have. The community physician will be on a salary basis 
—the various families of the community (and possibly annexed families 
outside of the community) being voluntarily assessed to make up the salary. 
As long as the physician practices for fees, for treating sick people, his financial 
interest is in the direction of the high mortality and morbidity rates, and his 
professional interests are primarily those of a physician. As soon as the 
manner of compensation is changed to a salary, the physician’s financial 
interest is exactly reversed and in the direction of low morbidity and mor- 
tality rates, and his professional interests are primarily those of a health 
officer and only secondarily those of a physician. In short, and in conclusion, 
by changing the method of compensation from fees to salaries, you change 
the primary interest of the profession from sickness to health, you put the 
premium on the ounce of prevention and the penalty on the pound of cure, 
and this, in my judgment, is the most far-reaching influence of the com- 
munity health proposition. 
THE NEED OF RURAL NURSES, 
Mrs. Lafon Riker, Chairman Health Department, Kentucky Federation of 
Women’s Clubs. 
That health supervision is needed sadly in the country as much or more 
than in the cities is no longer a doubtful question. Outside the large centers 
the movement for medical inspection of schools is in its infancy. Money is 
scarce and county health officers are not sufficiently paid to undertake work 
that to them seems unnecessary. 
“Rural schools are, with only a few exceptions, entirely unprovided with 
health supervision of any nature. Yet these are the very places most in need 
of it. People in the country are little inclined to seek aid from physicians 
or dentists, simply because they have not yet been educated to do so except 
in serious cases. It therefore happens that children of the rural schools are 
in general (contrary to the general impression) more in need of medical and 
dental attention than the children of larger communities. There is also a 
common impression that country children are naturally more vigorous than 
city children. This ought to be true, but unfortunately, it is not. In general, 
food is not as well prepared as it is in the city; the available variety is smaller; 
the houses and schools are less well ventilated; over heating in winter is com- 
mon; tuberculosis is not so well understood and chances for house infection 
are therefore greater, and general public sanitation is almost without excep- 
tion neglected in the country. ‘ 
Children in the country are more exposed to unfavorable weather conditions 
than are city children. They often walk long distances in the heat, cold or 
wet. They almost invariably wear too much clothing indoors in cold weather, 
and are consequently overheated in the schoolroom and are then chilled 
on the way home. As an example of this last statement, the writer last 
winter visited a rural district school one day, when the outdoor temperature
-P-A-G-E-200
      196 CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION 
was ten degrees below zero. On stepping into the school, the room seemed 
rather warm and, upon looking at the thermometer, she found it registered 
exactly ninety degrees. There was, therefore, a difference of 100 degrees 
between the outside and the inside temperature—a condition which is not 
exceptional in rural schools. In spite of the high temperature of this school- 
room, some pupils were present who were wearing heavy woolen Mackinaw 
stockings, over which were pulled heavy felt shoes reaching nearly to the 
knees. Many wore a thick, woolen sweater over a vest, shirt, and undershirt, 
and in some instances two or more undergarments were worn beneath the 
outer shirt. In the case of one boy, six layers of fairly heavy clothing were 
counted, and the body was, of course, bathed in perspiration. Under such 
conditions it is no wonder that colds and other respiratory disorders are 
common, and that many country children are out of school on account of 
various kinds of sickness. 
The sanitation of a rural school is usually very bad. The common drinking 
cup hangs from a nail over the water pail; floors and desks are often very 
dirty; ventilation is a negligible quantity; outdoor toilets are in unspeakable 
condition; washing facilities are either not provided at all, or consist of a 
pail of water, a dirty tin basin and one common towel. 
There are probably just as many adenoid, tonsil, ear and eye cases among 
country children as among city children, and what is true of these defects 
is, no doubt, true of nearly all the other common physical defects. 
This point, however, is one which needs careful investigation before exact 
comparisons can be made. My own somewhat limited experience with children 
in rural schools leads me to believe that the proportion of defects among city 
and country children is about the same, and that in general vigor, city children 
have, on the average, a very considerable advantage over their country 
brothers and sisters. 
There is no doubt as to the value of the trained nurse in both city and 
rural work. Although comparatively few years have elapsed since special 
education was thought necessary, she has abundantly demonstrated her 
ability to cope with problems which the physician cannot solve. In com- 
munities where the medical inspector is employed and his discoveries of dis- 
eases and defects are recorded upon the card and the child is sent home from 
school with instructions to visit the family doctor, all too frequently little 
attention is paid to the warning. If followed up by the nurse who visits that 
home and tactfully instructs the parents until they see the necessity of the 
action, not only is the safety of the child assured, but the nurse has opened 
a way for instructing that family in practical hygiene. 
In almost all educational work the adults must be reached through the 
children. Mrs. Cora Wilson Stewart tells of the effective work done in this 
way in starting the moonlight schools in Rowan county. In many instances 
the indifferent fathers and mothers came to school because the children in- 
sisted they did not want to have the only illiterate parents. In teaching the 
principles of right living, the easiest way to penetrate ignorance in the home 
is through the children. A competent professional nurse, with a keen social 
instinct, can form a connecting link between teachers, parents and, phy- 
sicians when needed, with perhaps more of success than any other single 
agency.

To the Board of Directors of the Southern Educational Association: 
Although it has been only five months since the last meeting of the Associa- 
tion, I presume that the regular report to be incorporated in the Volume of 
Proceedings of the Louisville meeting is in order and I beg to submit the fol- 
lowing report of my work as Secretary-Treasurer of the Southern Educational 
Association since the last meeting of the Association in Nashville, November 
1, 1913. 
Upon assuming the duties of the Secretary-Treasurer of the Association, 
I found the books, reports, etc., of Mr. Feagin, former Secretary, in excellent 
condition. 
The following meetings of the Executive Committee have been held since 
the last meeting of the Association: 
Atlanta, Ga., December 31, 1913. 
Richmond, Va., February 24-25, 1914. 
In addition to the above meetings, and after considerable correspondence 
with the executive officers of the Conference for Education in the South, 
the unanimous vote of the Executive Committee of the Southern Educa- 
tional Association was taken by mail about January 25th, in which it was .

decided to hold the next meeting of the Association as a joint meeting with 
the Conference for Education in the South, at Louisville, Ky., April 7-10, 
1914, which place and time had been previously been selected by the Confer- 
ence.

Orders for earlier volumes are frequently received and shown in the regu- 
lar report under head of receipts. 
Proceedings of the Nashville volume were sent out by parcel post March 25, 
1914. In turning over the work of Secretary-Treasurer to me, Mr. Feagin 
suggested the chief necessity just now to be that of economy and this feature 
of the work has been carefully guarded. In contracting for the volume, I 
found that by allowing the work to be done at odd times by one firm, I could 
save something over $100.00 on the contract, and hence the delay in mailing 
the volume. Furthermore, the regulation of the Post-Office Department 
including books under the new parcel post rate, took effect March 16, 1914, 
and by waiting until after that date, something over $50.00 was saved on 
delivery of the volumes. 
At the time the contract was given your Secretary-Treasurer had no idea 
that the next meeting of the Association would be held until some time 
in the following fall, and hence the necessity for hurrying out the volume did 
not appear. In fact, the President, in a letter to the Secretary-Treasurer, 
stated that there was no need of hurry in getting out the volumes. 
The President of the Association holds a bond on the Secretary-Treasurer 
for the protection of the Association, and item covering cost of same appears 
in the report under disbursements. 
Your Secretary-Treasurer has kept an accurate account of all receipts 
and disbursements since taking charge of the office and all bills have been 
paid by check. Some days ago President Tate appointed an Auditing Com- 
mittee, which committee has been notified that my records, books, vouchers,

In conclusion, I wish to express my deep appreciation of the honor con- 
ferred upon me by the Board in electing me to the office of Secretary-Treasurer 
of the Association, and also of the hearty co-operation and sympathy of the 
officers and members in my efforts in the interest of the Association. How- 
ever, I feel that the work demands more attention than I am able to give, 
and I beg to submit herewith my resignation to take effect at the earliest 
date possible consistent with the interests of the Association. 
Respectfully submitted, 
R. A. Ciarton, 
Secretary-Treasurer.

President Tate referred briefly to the activities of his office since the last 
meeting, the chief of which being the question of affiliation with the Confer- 
ence for Education in the South, and stated that matters of importance con- 
nected with the affiliation were responsible for his calling the meeting of the 
Board so early in the week, thus giving an opportunity for a second meeting, 
should it be necessary. 
In addition to an informal report, the President submitted the following 
copy of a communication which he had mailed out to the membership of the 
Association on February 3, 1914: 
To the Members of the Southern Educational Association: 
After careful consideration by a committee appointed at the Nashville 
meeting of the Southern Educational Association, the Executive Committee 
of the Southern Educational Association and of the Conference for Education 
in the South, have decided to hold a joint meeting in Louisville, Ky., April 
7 to 10, 1914. . The following has been agreed upon as the tentative basis for 
affiliation: 
I. The two bodies will meet together in Louisville, Ky., April 7 to 10, 
1914. 
II. The Southern Educational Association will have charge of the pro- 
grams dealing with the professional phases of the educational 
problem. 
These programs will consist of one or more general meetings 
and one or more sessions of the Southern Educational Council, and 
of the departments arranged by the Executive Committee or re- 
quired by the Constitution of the Association.

  SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
We suggest the following joint sessions: 
(a) The Department of Higher Education, and the College Con- 
ference. 
(b) The Department of Superintendence, and the Conference of 
County Superintendents. S 
(c) The Department of Normal Schools, and the Conference of 
Workers for the Training of Teachers. 
The programs of the Conference for Education in the South will deal 
with co-operation, with rural organization and with social and 
economic development. It will provide for conferences of farmers, 
women, preachers, doctors, editors and business men, with such 
mass meetings as may grow out of these. 
It is agreed that the Conference shall make such demonstrations 
as may be needful to: exhibit the relation of the rural school to 
community activities and development. 
It is suggested that the committee of the Conference to study a State 
system of schools co-operate with the committee appointed by the 
Southern Educational Council for the same purpose, and with the 
committee of the County Superintendents’ Conference, which is 
considering a county system of schools, and that these committees 
agree upon one report, to be submitted to a joint meeting of the 
Conference and the Southern Educational Association. 
We suggest the following evening programs: _ - Memorial service in honor of Mr. Robert C. Ogden. 
2. A farm-life program. 
3. Southern Educational Association. 
4. Joint session of the Conference and the Southern Educational 
Association, to consider reports from the committee on a 
State system of schools, on taxation, and possibly from other 
committees. 
It is agreed that the programs be co-ordinated by the executive officers 
of the two bodies and that duplication be avoided. 
It is agreed that the Association shall continue its membership fee 
of two ($2.00) dollars, and that the Conference shall charge two 
($2.00) dollars for the Proceedings, to be published in a joint 
volume. 
The part paid by each body will be determined by the number 
of pages its proceedings require. 
Such copies as either body may wish to send complimentary 
to individuals, libraries, or institutions, shall be supplied to the 
executive officers at the actual cost of production,

  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 211 
For several years there has been a feeling that an affiliation of these two 
organizations would prevent dissipation of energy and reduplication of effort. 
The necessity of attending two meetings with similar programs has constituted 
a needless drain upon the time of the Southern educational workers. At Louis- 
ville the two bodies may consider the advisability of permanent affiliation. 
As President of the Southern Educational Association, I ask your loyal 
efforts to make the Louisville joint meeting the best in the history of the two 
bodies. Let us take to Louisville 2,000 members of the Southern Educational 
Association. 
Enclosed herewith find an application card. Would you make a personal 
effort to secure at least one new member? 
Fraternally yours, 
W. K. Tats, 
President Southern Educational Association.

  Report of the Committee of the Conference for Education in the South 
and the Council of the Southern Educational Association on A State School 
System—Its Administration and Finance. 
      
    
    I. Gmnerat PRINCIPLES. 
   1. The administration of the State school system should be representative 
and democratic—responsive to the deliberately expressed will of the people. 
2. The administrative boards should possess stability sufficient to enable 
them to determine definite educational policies, and authority enough to 
        
-P-A-G-E-220
    
   
                                        
   
                           
              
                   216 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
provide for the execution of these policies. Changes in the personnel of the 
educational boards should be gradual, never revolutionary. The executive 
officer of a board should derive his authority from the board itself, not from 
any other source. 
3. The State and county boards should be empowered to select experts 
as State @a county school officials without limitation as to residence; they 
should be in the position to assure them a reasonable permanence in the tenure 
of position and adequate compensation for their services; they should have 
authority, through their executive officers, to organize effectively the public 
school system of the State. 
4. The State as a whole should guarantee an educational opportunity to 
all her children, regardless of the wealth or poverty of the particular county 
or district in which they live. 
Il. ApmrnisTRATION. 
1. The State Board of Education. 
The administration of the State common school system should be vested 
in a non-partisan State board of education, to be composed of not more than 
nine members, a majority of whom shall be educators, to be selected for terms 
of six years; these terms to be so arranged that not more than two expire 
in any one year. 
2. The State Superintendent of Education. 
The State superintendent of education should be elected by the State 
Board of Education, who shall serve as its executive officer, for a term of four 
years, and his salary should be fixed by the board. 
In addition to an adequate office force, the State superintendent should 
have as many assistants as may be necessary for the effective administra- 
tion and supervision of the schools. These assistants should be nominated 
by the State superintendent and confirmed by the State board. In the 
southern States the corps should, perhaps, include: 
(a) A State inspector of high schools. 
(b) A State supervisor of elementary schools. 
(c) A State supervisor of negro schools. 
(d) A State director of elementary agricultural education. 
(e) A State director of home-making activities for girls. 
(f) A State board of examiners for teachers. 
  3. The County Board of Education. 
The administration of the county school system should be vested in a 
county board of education, consisting of not less than three nor more than 
nine members, elected by the people for terms of six years, these terms to 
be so arranged that not more than two expire in any one year.
-P-A-G-E-221
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 217 
4. The County Superintendent of Education. 
The county superintendent of education should be elected by the county 
board, and should serve as its executive officer, for a term of four years. His 
salary should be fixed by this board. 
The county superintendent should have a corps of assistants commensurate 
with the school population of his county. These assistants should be nomi- 
nated by the superintendent and confirmed by the county board. In the 
typical county, the corps should include: + 
(a) A county supervisory teacher for the elementary schools. 
(b) A county supervisor of negro schools. 
(c) A county director of elementary agricultural education. 
(d) A county director of girls’ home arts. 
§. The District Trustees. 
Each school district should have from one to three trustees, appointed 
by the county board of education, to have charge of the school property and 
to serve in an advisory capacity the county superintendent and the county 
board of education. 
6. The School District. 
The school district should be, in some instances, a municipality, which 
may or may not be independent of the county school authorities. 
7. Rural Schools. 
The rural schools deserve special emphasis. The State and county educa- 
tional authorities should put forth special effort to make them efficient. The 
following standards are suggested: 
(a) Each rural school should own at least ten acres of land. 
(b) The schoolhouse should be put to the maximum use as a center of 
the community’s life. 
(c) The school should own an adequate home for its principal. 
(d) The principal should be trained in agriculture. 
(e) Each school should have at least one teacher who has had a prac- 
tical training in domestic science and household economics. 
8. Co-ordination Between the State’s Higher Institutions. 
There should be effective co-ordination between the State’s higher institu- 
tions, either by means of a State board for all of these institutions, or by 
means of a State council of higher education made up of representatives of 
the separate boards. 
III. Frvance. 
1. The State, the county, and the school district should each supply a 
proper quota of the funds for the maintenance of the schools. The State 
tax should be levied by the legislature, the county tax by the county board 
of education, and the district tax by the vote of its people.
-P-A-G-E-222
  218 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
2. Each State should establish the budgetary system for its educational 
finance—that is, that all of its educational funds should be ee as a 
whole, as a vital unit. 
3. The apportionment of the State’s total revenue should be upon the per- 
centage basis, and education should regularly have a certain percentage— 
approximately forty per cent. to fifty per cent. 
4. The elementary schools should regularly receive from fifty per cent. 
to fifty-five per cent. of the State’s total educational funds. The remainder 
of their income should be obtained from local county or district taxes. 
5. The high schools should regularly have from fifteen per cent. to eighteen 
per cent. of the State’s total educational funds. The other funds of these 
schools should come from the proceeds of local county or district taxes. 
6. The State’s higher institutions, since they cannot receive revenue from 
local taxes, should regularly have from thirty-five per cent. to forty per cent. 
of the State’s total educational funds. 
7. The aid which the State treasury supplies for the elementary and high 
schools should be apportioned to the county board of education, and through 
this board to the various individual schools, upon the basis of the local needs 
and efforts. 
8. Since the State’s educational revenue is derived chiefly from the taxes 
levied upon the taxable values of all the citizens of the State, and since the 
apportionment of the State’s educational funds to the counties is designed to 
aid and stimulate the weaker schools—the schools whose districts do not 
possess sufficient taxable values to make it possible for them unaided by the 
State to maintain effective instruction, we urge that each State make pro- 
vision for an efficient State tax commission, and endow it with large authority 
over the local assessment of taxables. 
This reported was adopted by the Council of the Southern Educational 
Association and presented to the Conference at its final session, Louisville, 
April 10, 1914, by the chairman of the Conference Committee, Dr. Charles 
Lee Raper. It was received without objection.

PROCEEDINGS 
GENERAL SESSION 
PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS. 
W. K. Tarts, Columbia, 8. C. 
Fellow Members of the Southern Educational Association, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
This evening marks what we hope is the beginning of the consummation 
of a wish which has been expressed many times during the past years, as the 
Southern teachers have attended the annual conventions of the Southern 
Educational Association and the Conferences for Education in the South. 
After serious deliberations, the executive committees of these two organiza- 
tions have arranged for a joint meeting in Louisville. We are here represent- 
ing not merely the teaching profession of the South, but also the various other 
professions and business interests which with us constitute the basis of our 
social progress. 
The Southern Educational Association was organized twenty-four years 
ago. It has had a large part in the evolution of the larger ideals of education 
in the Southern States. Its career has been no flowery pathway. It has 
numbered among its. officers and its members, the leaders in Southern educa- 
tion, and these have given freely of their time, energy and devotion to its 
maintenance. Its meetings have not always been largely attended, but its 
influence has never been measured by the size of its annual conventions. 
After twenty-four years of existence it stands firmly rooted in the affections 
of the Southern teacher, free from debt, and with the healthy energy which 
comes from a successful struggle to maintain its own existence and to assist 
in the solution of the problems of education in the South. 
Eighteen years ago the Conference for Education in the South was born 
of the heart and brain of Robert C. Ogden, and under his patronage, and with 
the generous support of the Southern Educational Board, has developed into 
2 force which has helped to weld into one impulse the educational aspirations 
and activities of all our people. The Conference has been a favorite daughter 
of the South, and has grown strong, and fair and beautiful. 
This sturdy youth of twenty-four and this fair maiden at eighteen, are 
now guests at a house party in the city of Louisville. What is more natural 
than a proposal from the young man that hereafter their fortunes should be 
united, and that together they strive for the realization of their common 
ideals?

    PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 224 
Since the organization of these two Associations the definition of the word 
“education” has been greatly enlarged. Formerly, the term called forth the 
picture of a bespectacled pedagogue with rod and book in hand teaching the 
young idea how to shoot, or, of the contemplative scholar delving into ancient 
lore. Now, the composite photograph includes the teacher in his country 
schoolroom, the university professor solving the social and economic problems 
of State, the doctor formulating his campaign for community health, the 
economist devising a modern scheme of taxation, the farmer teaching his 
fellow farmer how to make two ears of corn grow where one grew before, 
and the business man organizing plans for community co-operation. All these 
are educators in the truest sense of the word and the success of each is condi- 
tioned by the success of all. 
There is no reason why the elements represented by our two organizations 
should not completely coalesce. For many years we have been holding 
our meetings apart. We have gradually come to discuss the same subjects. 
Our committees have been working on the same problems, the conventions 
were made up of the same people. Attendance on two annual gatherings has 
constituted an unnecessary sacrifice of time and money. I am glad to an- 
nounce that committees of the two organizations, appointed by their Boards 
of Directors, are now working on a plan of permanent union. It is my earnest 
desire, as president of the Southern Educational Association, that the mar- 
riage may occur under my administration and in the city of Louisville, and 
that these two great educational forces of the South may live happily ever 
after, with a common purpose and in pursuit of one high ideal. 
THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS IN THE SOUTH. 
Dr. Bruce R. Payne, Nashville, Tenn. 
   Ladies and Gentlemen: 
We have reached that point in the development of Southern education that 
we can no longer deceive the taxpayer by public arousements, by building of 
big schoolhouses and by multiplying the numbers of students attending our 
schools. He has discovered that all these may exist and the school proceed 
quite as haltingly as in other years. He is beginning to reach out somewhat 
blindly for the higher things of the spirit as the ultimate good which he was 
led to expect, not being satisfied with the merely physical assets we have 
hitherto presented. For all these are in themselves no guarantee of efficient 
educational progress. After the big noise is over he persistently returns to 
the demand that his boy be taught better and more in the new schoolhouse, 
and that the efficiency and opportunities of his daughter be increased as the 
school increases its numbers. He wants a better school teacher as well as more 
school teachers. If we don’t give them to him during the next decade his 
support in taxation will justly decline. After all, then, a skilled human being 
is the sine qua non in this as in other manufacturing establishments. 
Some weeks ago I directed the following letter to several hundred of the
-P-A-G-E-226
     
     222 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
leading educators of the South who have to do with the training of teachers 
for the public schools: 
“Will you please state what is being done toward teacher-training in your 
State by each of the following agencies: 
“1, By the supervisors in their classrooms? 
“2, By the county teachers’ association? 
“3. By the State teachers’ association? 
“4, By the State reading courses for teachers? 
“5. By the State school journal? 
“6. By the county institutes? 
“7, By the high school training course? 
“8, By summer schools? 
“9. By the normal schools. 
“10. By the college university and departments of education? 
“11. By any other agency? 
“As near as possible,. will you please describe the qualifications, resource, 
and efficiency of each agency? Will you also give the number of teachers. 
affected by such agency?” 
I received a great many replies to this letter, and I wish to take this oppor- 
tunity to thank most sincerely all who have co-operated with me in this study, 
for their help in gathering the information which I needed to have before me 
in order to discuss intelligently the subject assigned. 
It may be well to note, however, that these letters, even when from the same 
State, didn’t answer the question in the same way. This was, of course, to 
be expected, but it was somewhat surprising to find that in matters of fact, 
very different answers were given to the same question, showing that there 
is not at hand anywhere exact information relating to the questions asked. 
All these letters were carefully read and digested, and the facts included 
in them were tabulated so that whatever discrepancies might exist, would 
readily appear in the summary. It is not my purpose to exhibit these dis- 
erepancies, nor to attempt to state in any statistical way exact conclusions 
regarding the data thus put at my disposal. 
Some very definite suggestions, however, have emerged from a study of this 
valuable information, and to these I wish to direct your consideration. 
It will be noted that six out of ten of the present agencies of teacher train- 
ing are to be classed among the unsystematic, local, or immediate agencies 
of improvement. They are near-by and available, hence fraught with far 
greater possibilities of helpfulness or of danger than the other three whose 
influences are not brought to bear upon the teacher while tense with the ex- 
citement of daily battle. 
I. SUPERVISION. 
It is very clear that outside of well organized and supervised city school 
systems there is practically no real and effective training of the teachers of 
the South through supervision of their daily work in the classroom. So far 
as I have been able to determine, only six of the Southern States have made 
any decisive progress in real supervision and training of the country teachers,   
-P-A-G-E-227
       PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 223 
while they are actually at work in the classroom; and even in these States a 
comparatively small body of teachers has been positively and vitally affected 
by this kind of training. 
Probably West Virginia, which has sixty-two district supervisors, each with 
approximately thirty-five teachers under his control, has the most effective 
classroom training for rural teachers of all the States in the South. South 
Carolina seems to be awakening with commendable vigor to this opportunity. 
One of the communications regarding the work in Virginia states that there 
are ninety division superintendents, fifty per cent. of them well prepared to 
do this work, while the other half has not had sufficient training and skill 
to make their supervision more than passably effective. True, most of the 
Southern States have State supervisors, working with the State superintend- 
ent’s office, but it is clearly obvious that three or four State supervisors can 
do very little in a direct way to supervise and train all the rural school teachers 
of any Southern State. 
I submit, therefore, that one of the largest problems in connection with the 
training of teachers in the South is that of supplying a large body of trained 
supervisors who will be effectively and immediately useful, especially to the 
younger teachers, while they are at work in the country schools. Were it 
possible for our normal schools to graduate a sufficient number of teachers 
each year to fill all vacancies occurring in the teaching staff of the country 
schools, this problem of supervision within the classroom would be far less 
important than it is. But as every one knows, the normal schools of the South, 
including all that are attempting to do any valuable teacher-training, are 
totally inadequate to prepare a sufficient number of teachers to fill the va- 
cancies. 
As conditions now exist, a majority of the teachers engaged in the work 
of the country schools are licensed to teach as a result of an examination, which 
under even the best conditions, cannot test teachers as to their practical skill 
in handling the children and the program of the country school, to say nothing 
of their ability to organize and unify the educational interests of their re- 
spective communities. 
However, the evidence shows plainly that recently improvements have been 
made in this direction, and that the Southern States are attempting to supply 
this deficiency by appointing assistant county superintendents and district 
superintendents, and by organizing the State supervising force to meet these 
needs. I wish to emphasize the fact that there is a very large opportunity 
and a very urgent need for all institutions of the South which are engaged 
in the training of teachers to prepare in a worthy and specific way a large 
number of supervisors for the country and village schools. These super- 
visors must be qualified not only by education, but also by practical train- 
ing to show the teachers how to do their work better. 
Where would -a prospective teacher intending to consecrate his young 
life to.rural education, go in the South or in the republic, to receive tolerably 
adequate training for this service? 
We must look into the actual, every-day needs, of our country communities, 
of our small districts, of our changing urban population, of our cotton-mill . 
settlements, for standards for the requisite subject matter, and somewhat    
-P-A-G-E-228
   
    224 SOUTHERN EpucATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
for the essential method of teacher-training. We must select the target 
before we shoot. For much of the firing is at tandom, and by the blind-folded. 
The great majority of our educational problems and difficulties must be 
solved in real school life, in our rapidly transforming social and educational 
situation. There is a certain unescapable vividness in a pressing question 
emerging in a real school upon a real day, and amid the very agencies and 
instrumentalities that create it and may answer it, which declines with the 
passing days, and which is never present in the remote discussions of rural 
questions. Certain vital problems cannot be pulled apart and solved by the 
teacher. Many will not endure delays. More cease to exist by the time of 
the distant answer. Many tasks are only perceptible in real school teaching. 
Many are forgotten if delayed. We must bring the sources of help near the 
teacher through the trained supervisor. 
Four Tasks or SUPERVISION. 
1. In the present emergency we must take the training to the teacher until 
the decade arrives when we can take the teacher to the training. 
2. This situation requires that all teacher-training agencies must power- 
fully concentrate their energies upon the training of supervisors. 
8. It means further that the taxpayers through their representatives must 
provide additional salaries and increased salaries to induce men and women 
of superior ability to take the training and to give their lives to the supervision 
of schools. 
4. If these two agencies do not concentrate and co-operate in this one task, 
there will be little perceptible improvement in the quality.of public school 
teaching during our generation in the South. 
II. County AssocraTIoNs. 
In all the Southern States, with one or two exceptions, the teachers of a 
county, parish, or district, have voluntarily organized themselves into asso- 
ciations which meet once a month or once in two months for social contact 
and professional advancement. Generally some sort of a program is prepared 
for these meetings by one or more of the local teachers and supervisors, but 
the evidence shows that while these associations are helpful from an inspira- 
tional and social point of view, they exert comparatively little influence on 
the development of skill in the younger and less trained teachers engaged 
in the actual work. There is no desire on my part to underestimate the value 
of these associations. But it is very plain that unless a much more specific 
and definite plan of work is undertaken to help in a commendable way the 
younger teachers who are struggling to give good service without the nec- 
essary preparation, the local teachers’ associations are never going to prove 
an important factor in teacher training. I submit, therefore, that all super- 
visors, State, district, and county, should attempt earnestly to direct these 
associations to undertake a more serviceable and consecutive line of work, if 
the opportunity these gatherings offer is not to be wasted in desultory, im- 
practical and unrelated endeavors. Furthermore, it seems to me that the  
-P-A-G-E-229
PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 225 
normal schools and all other agencies, whose chief endeavor should be to 
increase the efficiency of rural and village teachers, ought to see to it that 
special courses are given, looking toward preparing programs and methods 
of procedure to accomplish this purpose. While, as suggested, these county 
and district associations are voluntary, and have been carried on in a more or 
less haphazard way, there is a large opportunity to make them one of the 
most effective agencies that we can use to influence and help all teachers 
engaged in rural school work. Such programs and plans must include actual, 
practical direction in classroom work, and specific help in organizing the social 
forces of the community and in bringing to the country people better guidance 
in all educational and social endeavors. No teacher engaged in service should 
be denied this aid. 
III. Srarz TeacnErs’ AssocraTion. 
State teachers’ associations exist in all Southern States. The work of these 
associations is still further removed from the practical needs of the day’s 
labor. than are the local associations. All those who furnished information 
agree that they are chiefly useful as unifying, socializing and inspirational 
agencies. Their programs deal in the main with general and more or less 
theoretical problems, and while, in the past few years, they have been split 
up into sectional meetings directed toward special lines of work, they have 
had comparatively little influence in developing skill and power within the 
teaching force. If I may hazard a general statement on this point, I would 
say that the State teachers’ associations have done their largest service in 
creating a general sentiment in favor of a complete public education and in 
bringing to the teachers inspiration and help from teachers and leaders from 
other States. It is difficult to state in what special way our State teachers’ 
associations should further direct their energies; but it may not be out of 
place to say that along with the encouragement and larger insight brought 
to the teachers in these gatherings, they should be made a more definite 
clearing-house for information concerning the work of the various parts of 
the State, and especially concerning the needs of the average rural school 
teacher. State teachers’ associations probably present the most powerful 
single agency through which new ideals and principles may be inaugurated 
and ultimately incorporated into the schools. This is notably true of reading 
courses for teachers, the library movement, the introduction of industrial 
education, the practical methods of the laboratory, ete. All the ideals dis- 
covered by the expert, all the difficulties faced by the lonely teacher, can 
find their way to effective functioning and to sensible solution in educational 
practice more quickly by a proper launching in the State teachers’ associa- 
tion than by any other plan now operating. 
We must not forget that seventy-five per cent. of the teachers of the South 
are classed as rural school teachers, and that practically the same percentage 
of pupils enrolled in our schools get’ their education in the country schools. 
This at once shows where our chief emphasis should be placed, both with 
reference to numbers and with reference to the actual needs of the teachers 
at work. Thus far I believe that our State associations have been of far
-P-A-G-E-230
  226 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
more service to the city teachers than to the country teachers. Indeed, a 
letter from one State definitely says that the State teachers’ association in 
that State has been looked upon as an association for city teachers, and hence 
the country school teachers have not attended and therefore have not re- 
ceived any benefit from it. It is not too much to ask, therefore, that an in- 
stitution whose chief work is measured by the service it renders in preparing 
better teachers should undertake to study and outline with its students better 
programs and better policies for our State teachers’ associations. I know of 
no course of education given in any institution in the South which has for its 
purpose the development of guidance or help in this direction. 
IV. Srare Reapine Course. 
All the States, save one, have reported some form of reading circle course 
for its teachers during the year. Several of the States make this work com- 
pulsory, either by placing a premium in the way of certification upon it 
or by creating a sentiment amongst the teachers to the effect that those who 
do it satisfactorily have a better chance for promotion than those who do not 
undertake it. The reward of effort by advancement of those pursuing the 
reading course is a very effective method in many States. It should be imitated 
by others. The question may naturally be asked if reading circles are good 
for some teachers why the public authorities, as in North Carolina, do not 
act upon the assumption that they are of value to and needed by ALL teachers? 
Generally, two to four books are selected by a committee of the State 
teachers’ association or by the State superintendent, and these books are the 
basis for study and examination during the year. I cannot help feeling that 
while this work has been done in a more or less perfunctory way in many 
cases, it has proved of great service for the general training of teachers. Here, 
again, the training exists not so much in the development of skill as in the 
use of wider knowledge and the suggestions accruing from such knowledge. 
While the doctrines of pragmatism have definite limitations, I believe that 
we can all subscribe to the general proposition that knowledge is of compar- 
atively little worth unless it issues in definite betterment in the practical 
affairs of life. That knowledge is of the most use which is put to practice and 
the best test of knowledge that we thus far have found, is, as Mr. Dooley would 
say, “It will wur-r-k.”’ 
The reading circle work of the State is an agency that can be developed 
into one of the most useful and one of the most far-reaching instrumentalities 
connected with professional growth and skill. Its usefulness will be mea- 
sured largely by the practical bearing of the books selected upon the immedi- 
ate needs of the teachers asked to do the reading and by the wisdom of the 
leading teachers in the county, who know how to organize and inflame with 
enthusiasm the groups of workers concerned. Plainly, in every group of 
teachers, meeting together to study and to make the most of the books 
selected, there should be many trained workers with sufficient skill to know 
how to turn to useful ends theoretical knowledge and power and to measure 
the value of theory in terms of practice. There should be more attention 
given in the higher institutions engaged in training teachers to preparation

                       PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 227 
of leaders for these reading circles, so that whenever groups are gathered 
together for this purpose it will include those who can guide and make effective. 
What a splendid chance for the State or county superintendent to align 
all the faculties of institutions of higher learning in a co-operative scheme 
for the promotion of the reading of valuable books by all the teachers of the 
State. 
V. Scooon JourNats. 
Practically all States have one or more school journals, which are, theo- 
retically, if not organically, a part of the teacher-training agencies of the 
State. Some of these are doing effective service. Others are more or less 
perfunctory and aside from presenting much theory and news, they give the 
teachers no specific help. I am inclined to think that it would be an eye- 
opener to many of the editors of the school journals of the South if they could 
have the privilege of seeing themselves as my correspondents have seen them. 
These journals, however, in many cases, give the State superintendents of 
education good opportunity to put before the progressive teachers of the 
State many suggestions with reference to proposed plans for better service, 
and they are especially helpful in matters touching school legislation. But 
my experience leads me to say that the average country school teacher takes 
very little interest in the problems of school legislation, and thus far has had 
little influence in shaping the development of this part of our educational 
machinery. I have no ex cathedra suggestions to offer with reference to the 
increased usefulness of our school journals, but I dare to risk the opinion that 
if the money expended on the various school journals now in existence in the 
Southern States could be concentrated in some way upon three or four high- 
class journals for certain groups of States, and an editorial organization of 
live teachers well seasoned by training and experience could continuously 
present to our teachers some of the living and burning questions of the hour 
in a human and helpful way, these journals would be far more effective in 
serving the teachers at work and in giving them a wider outlook into the whole 
problem of Southern education. Oh, what a wonderful opportunity for some 
daring soul with red blood in his veins and the love of 8,000,000 school chil- 
dren in his heart! 
                              
  VI. Country Tracuers’ Institutes. 
          
  In at least four, if not five, of the Southern States, there is nothing done of 
any practical value in the way of county teachers’ institutes. In other 
States these are compulsory and under the supervision of either the county 
superintendent or the State superintendent. Compulsory attendance upon 
some county institutes and city teachers’ meetings might well be questioned 
until they are made more worthy of attendance. At least, I, myself, have 
had to do with certain institutes, compulsory attendance upon which should 
be regarded as a malicious crime, punishable by imprisonment, death, or 
both. At all events, for such attendance teachers should receive, as in Texas, 
full pay. They earn it. The consensus of opinion expressed in the letters 
I have received, is that while the institutes have been of very definite service 
      
                  
           
-P-A-G-E-232
        
   
       
    
   
                                             
    
           
                                        228 
  SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
in bringing the teachers together for guidance and direction by the county 
superintendent, they have often failed by not addressing themselves to the 
imperative needs of the inexperienced and more dependent teachers. For 
the most part, the institutes have brought the least service to those who are 
most dependent. And possibly they will always be so, because those who 
know are always able to get more from the same instruction than those who 
know less. Knowledge is power, in that it gives those who possess it the 
ability to judge of relative values and to select what is most needed. To one 
who has had little or no training in the practical experience of the classroom, 
facts and theories are not always suggestive, and therefore, cannot be utilized 
in practice. It is common experience that the more we know the more we 
can learn. Hence the inexperienced teachers get less from attendance on the 
county institute than those who are less dependent. There is a pressing and 
serious need for the training of a body of workers to make our county institutes 
more vital and especially more generally helpful. Jf the teachers are not com- 
ing to our training schools, we must take our training schools to our teachers! 
This is a form of extension work open to every institution of higher learning 
in our midst—higher learning must concern and extend itself back to those 
who are not able to come to it, but upon whom the destinies of those citizens 
of tomorrow rest with heavy load. I hold it to be one of the questions of 
serious moment to the normal schools, colleges and universities engaged in 
educational work, to see to it that better plans and better men are developed 
for making our county institutes far more effective for the inexperienced 
teachers, both for classroom service and for service in the community. It 
is bound to be for a long time to come one of the agencies which will afford 
opportunity to reach the whole body of teachers. 
These institutes should be organized more to help the unskilled teachers 
and to awaken the communities concerned to a larger and more vital con- 
ception of the true purpose and means of rural education. We must never 
forget that no rural education which is worthy of the name, can stop at mere 
classroom service. It must flow over into the community and touch in a real 
way the homes and all they represent. 
VII. Hicu Scuoots. 
   With reference to the question asked as to how far the high schools of the 
South are co-operating in the training of teachers, the answers make it clear 
that this possible agency has been of little or no service. The replies are almost 
unanimous that thus far the high schools of the South have not undertaken in 
any worthy way the training of rural school teachers. It is true that in a few 
States and in a few cities in these States, certain courses have been designated 
for the training of rural teachers, but for the most part these courses are 
theoretically planned and are given by those who have not had large and 
varied experience in actual teaching in the district schools. Those high schools 
which have offered courses designed to prepare teachers for the work in 
district schools have utilized their time and opportunities in preparing the 
students to pass the examinations for certificates. In other words, they have 
been coaching courses in the common branches and in those few lines of
-P-A-G-E-233
  
PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 229 
professional work required of all candidates for certification. The State 
and county officials must see to it that the high school training schools do 
not degenerate into mere coaching courses where boys and girls cram for 
teachers’ examinations rather than fit themselves for real teaching. 
Were it not for the fact that so many teachers now in service entered the 
ranks through examinations, I would unhesitatingly say that our high schools 
should not engage in this undertaking because they are not equipped to do 
it effectively. Still, under existing conditions, those high schools engaged 
in it are doing a service that probably would otherwise be left undone.. For 
the high school, whether we will or not, is to furnish most of the public school 
teachers within our generation. Other things being equal, the atmosphere 
of a good high school is more conducive to serious study and to a larger 
horizon than many so-called colleges. Arkansas and Virginia seem to have 
more fully appreciated the value of the high school as a source of supply for 
better trained teachers. Again, if the teachers are not coming to us we must 
go to them, by sending more highly skilled teachers of teachers to the high schools. 
VIII. Summer Scuoon. 
One of the marked elements of educational development of the last quarter 
of a century is the organization and growth of the summer school idea. Prac- 
tically all States in the union now have a number of summer schools. They 
are of all grades of excellence. Some of them might be fairly designated “stuff- 
ing schools;”’ others as intellectual and social dissipations, while others 
more properly and rightfully undertake to serve the teachers in a serious and 
helpful way. Extended experience both in theory and practice leads me to 
say without hesitation, that the summer school movement can be made a 
very effective agency in the training of teachers, but in order that these sum- 
mer sessions may reach the stage of effectiveness which we have a right to 
demand of them, the work undertaken should be as seriously and as wisely 
done as that undertaken during the regular session. In fact, I am constrained 
to believe that our summer schools deserve more earnest consideration and 
wiser administration than the average regular session; because, in the first 
place, they have a shorter session than the regular college or normal school 
session, and in addition they are dealing in the main with those teachers who 
come for special and well-defined help. Greater wisdom is needed on the 
part of teachers who teach in the summer schools than by those who work 
during the regular sessions. The short time at command should be given to 
the essentials, and clear-cut and definite impressions left of those subjects 
and courses undertaken. J'o know what to leave out, and what is best to give, 
are fundamental considerations with every teacher in summer sessions. 
There is no question about the great value of summer schools in the South. 
But it is also certain that there is much room for improvement, in order that 
we make the summer session more useful in this, our time of need. The faculty 
of a summer session should be the wisest faculty that we can get together. 
And their wisdom should be measured largely by their power to bring to this 
great body of eager workers ability to apply knowledge, and to give added 
insight and inspiration which will lead to a greater degree of skill. Summer 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  230 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
sessions have, in addition to the opportunities afforded in the regular session, 
the chance of bringing to our people outside helpers, and in this way, creating 
that educational, cosmopolitan spirit that will issue in helping us to perceive 
more clearly our own local conditions and to gain suggestions from a situa- 
tion different from our own. I repeat, that I believe our summer schools 
demand far more serious consideration than they have thus far received. 
It is certainly a most important sign of the times to see how many teachers 
in our Southern States are willing and anxious to spend their money and their 
time attending summer schools, both in the institutions of their own States, 
and in those of other States. 
I take off my hat and bow my head in admiration and respect to the teachers 
of the South who employ for the renewal of their powers six weeks of arduous 
labor, in the hot months of their well-earned vacation. I have known per- 
sonally and intimately of their individual suffering, sacrifice and sorrow. 
When I see one of these buoyant patriots of the republic isolating herself 
from the companionship of her intellectual peers, and sacrificing positions of 
worldly honor, financial compensation and ease, for the redemption of child- 
hood, I cannot refrain from voicing the words of the prophet, saying, “Blessed 
are they that be teachers, for they shall shine as the firmament forever and 
ever.” 
IX. Normau Scxoots. 
The normal schools of the South are doing a very large and useful service 
in our educational scheme. There are approximately 15,000 students within 
their walls during each scholastic year. To them the South has hitherto looked 
and will continue to look for the great majority of its trained teachers. Their 
responsibility for proper, useful and helpful teaching is tremendously over- 
powering. Certainly there is abundant opportunity for improvement among 
them, and they are responding to that opportunity. I have no disposition 
to criticize them. For they are doing more than anybody else, and in fact, 
almost all that is being done. I find myself longing to sympathize with and 
help them, and not to ventilate their shortcomings. But it ought to sober 
us a little when we consider that all the graduates of all the normal schools 
in the South would not suffice to recruit the ranks in many single States, and 
that a large percentage of the teachers in rural schools have had not a single 
day in actual normal school work. 
As long as the professional life of our rural teachers is so short, as long as 
the wages paid are so small, as long as the terms of our country schools are 
so brief, as long as the majority of the teachers in the country schools are 
women, as long as most of these women prefer to get married rather than to 
teach school, we are face to face with the problem of supplying an immense 
army of teachers each year, and experience shows us that our normal schools 
do not receive the students and are not able to keep them long enough to pre- 
pare sufficient numbers to fill the ranks. Hence our contention that no one 
should undertake the work of the district school who has not had normal school 
training, is at present, an impractical one, because the normal schools are 
not equipped financially or otherwise to train this body of teachers, and 
furthermore, the young people who are looking forward to teaching are un-
-P-A-G-E-235
  
PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES Zo 
willing to sacrifice the time and expense required for such training. There i§ 
no way left, then, save certification through examination and the haphazard 
training associated with this method of securing teachers. I fear it will be 
a long time before no one will be permitted to enter the public schools of the 
South as a teacher who has not had ample academic and professional training 
to do the work as it should be done. Meanwhile, it is plainly the duty of all 
the agencies now at work in the training of teachers to create a public sentiment 
for lengthened terms of schools in our rural districts, for more men in the 
profession, for better wages, and above all, that our children deserve teachers 
who are capable of serving them most helpfully and of entering into the life 
of the rural community more energetically and with greater wisdom. 
X. CoLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
The colleges and universities of the South have developed in recent years 
departments of education, in the main designed to prepare teachers for high 
schools, and in addition, to furnish opportunity for leaders, in other lines of 
work, to become acquainted with the best educational theory and practice 
of our time. If the work of these departments is measured alone by the number 
of skilled teachers they have sent into the profession, the results would be 
discouraging. But measured by the value of the services rendered by the 
graduates of these departments who have gone out into various States and 
are now occupying commanding positions, the results are far more gratify- 
ing and encouraging. I feel certain, therefore, that while from an immediately 
practical point of view, the training of teachers by universities and colleges 
commands little attention, from a larger point of view, it deserves our hearty 
endorsement and co-operation. Nevertheless, it may not be unjust to re- 
mark that the time has come when the university and college departments 
of education should be equipped with better facilities for the actual training 
of teachers in daily classroom work. We have the right to look to these de- 
partments for information and guidance, and especially for advancement of 
knowledge in our profession. We are certain, however, that they deserve 
better opportunity for the actual training of teachers, with special reference 
to skilled supervisors, superintendents, and those occupying higher official 
positions in our public school systems. 
They will never turn out large numbers. The quality of men and women 
sent out from these institutions and their points of view will constitute the 
important contributions which the university and college departments will 
make. For despite the general feeling to the contrary, possibly as a whole, 
the teachers in our colleges are less effectively trained for their work than any 
other workers in the school system, save the rural school teachers, who come 
into the profession merely through passing some routine State or local ex- 
amination. One big problem, then, for the departments of education to con- 
sider and toward which their work shoutd be directed, is that of training real 
teachers for fields of service before them. I mean not merely giving an acad- 
emic education, but actual training in the work of teaching. 
Some of the most hopeless teachers in our whole educational machinery 
are found within college walls in college faculties. This should not be. The 
   
-P-A-G-E-236
  232 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
departments of education are face to face with the problem of not only train- 
ing their own faculties, but of breaking down the common prejudice against 
the need of such training. To put a class of freshmen students in the hands 
of a raw doctor of philosophy, who has never taught a day in his life, who 
has never seriously thought of the problems of education, and who has de- 
cided in his own mind that technical knowledge and skill in teaching are syn- 
onymous terms, is a more serious blunder than to put a class of children in 
the hands of a young girl whose education has not extended beyond the dis- 
trict school, and whose professional worth is measured by her ability to pass 
a perfunctory examination for a low grade teacher’s certificate. The sooner 
we appreciate this situation and undertake to apply the remedy, the more 
effective will be our teaching in the highest schools of our country. 
In another respect fhe departments of education in colleges and universities 
occupy a very strategic position. They may inspire the youth of genius who 
attend these institutions with a deep-seated interest in education as a legiti+ 
mate duty of all public-spirited citizens. They may present teaching as a 
worthy life vocation to students who otherwise may miss the very field of 
endeavor for which they are singularly well-endowed. 
An enormous waste could be eliminated by a modest expenditure by each 
college in the South for a professor of education who could train its prospective 
teacher-students in the relative values of things to be done and to be avoided 
when they first enter the profession. The waste is tremendous in imposing 
senior-year methods upon primary grades; in repeating mistakes in curricula, 
organization, method and discipline, which have been disqualified for a cen- 
tury. The relative importance of subjects to be taught in the public schools 
is not learned in one college out of a thousand. Standards of value applicable 
in college, but irrelevant in elementary schools are sometimes criminally 
foisted upon the children and citizens of a rural community. 
This is a serious task which the State must undertake in conserving and 
transmitting the successful experience of its best teachers for the oncoming 
generations and multitudes of young, untried men and women who would 
become the directors of the destinies of our children. These children must, 
in so far as possible, be protected against raw experimentation. The ability 
of the instructor should not be acquired at the expense of the instructed. 
For the handling of such affairs, institutions of learning exist. 
Indeed, we face a great undertaking and a great opportunity. Education 
must make life in the South more economically profitable and more spiritu- 
ally valuable. 
There is more soil in Tennessee than in New England, but their mixture 
of brains with soil will excel our mixture of blood and dirt. The schools 
need more money and the schools must make more money for the South and 
for themselves by training the 8,000,000 citizens of tomorrow to work more 
skillfully, efficiently and happily. 
All of the agencies herein described are struggling however imperfectly, 
toward the solution of such an ever-impending situation. 
If I may, with gentle forebearance, be permitted to mention my own work 
and that of George Peabody College for Teachers, I shall dare to express 
the hope that it may find its place as the humble servant of those other ten

forces already laboring with the Herculean load. We hope to establish a 
central clearing house of learning for the teachers of the south, where they 
may look for help assembled from all parts of the earth, where men have, in a 
measure, succeeded in transmitting the rich heritage of human achievement 
to their sons and daughters without diminution and without impairment. 
We shall hope to establish a central power house which will relay its energy 
to every remote and nearby station in need of what it has stored up from the 
spiritual dynamos of the world. It also will make mistakes, and will fail. 
But we will keep the machinery greased and going. It will continuously 
extend its lines of service until there shall shine forth beacon lights upon every 
mountain peak, and lighthouses upon every shore to light the ways of all our 
children upward from the dark valleys and the treacherous seas, with sun- 
shine and gladness surging in their hearts, to the highlands of efficiency, 
prosperity, happiness and peace. among our people. 
Into the hands of the school teachers of this land, then, we have placed for 
weal or for woe all the institutions of our democracy. By them our every 
stronghold of social intelligence and civic righteousness is built up and kept 
repaired, or by them the bulwarks of our civilization are allowed to decay. 
They are strong for their fearful task in proportion as every citizen sustains 
them and weak as we desert them. 
TEACHER TRAINING IN PRIVATE AND DENOMINATIONAL 
COLLEGES. 
Prof. J. Henry Highsmith, Wake Forest, N.C. 
The private and denominational colleges can do a great deal in the training 
of teachers, and the factors involved are the same as those found in any other 
school. In this training of teachers there are three factors to be considered 
by our colleges: 
1. General academic training. 
2. Theoretical professional training. 
3. Practical professional training. 
General academic training can be given as adequately and as effectively 
in a denominational college as anywhere else. It would be almost impossible 
to give an adequate description of the subjects to be pursued or to prescribe 
them definitely, but certain principles of selection have been indicated in the 
report of the Committee of Seventeen of the National Educational Associa- 
tion. This committee recommends that the academic preparation (of high 
school teachers) include the following elements: 
“(a) A detailed and specialized study of the subjects to be taught. The 
program of studies selected by each student should include work 
in subjects outside of those in which he is making special prepara- 
tion, sufficient to give some insight into the different fields of 
knowledge and to avoid the dangers of over-specialization. 
“(b) One or more subjects from a group, including history, economics  
-P-A-G-E-238
  234 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
and sociology, which will give the teacher a proper outlook upon 
the social aspects of education. 
“(c) A course in general psychology and at least one from a group of 
subjects including history of philosophy, logic and ethics, which 
will give the teacher a proper outlook upon education as the de- 
velopment of the individual.” 
This requirement can be met easily by any real college. The student should 
be advised and directed in the selection and pursuit of his course of study. 
He should be shown the advantage of preparing to teach at least two allied 
subjects, rather than only one subject. Such a selection will be better for 
him and for the school in which he teaches. For example, he can select English 
and Latin, or English and History, or Mathematics and Science, or English 
and Modern Languages. In other words, the student ought to feel reasonably 
“at home” in English, History, Mathematics, the Classics, the Modern Lan- 
guages, and the Sciences, and perfectly “at home’ in at least two of them. 
I would like to emphasize at this point the matter of the English language 
and literature. In my judgment, the student who expects to teach, ought to 
pursue the study of English for the entire college course, if possible, for it is 
undoubtedly the most important subject in elementary or secondary school, 
and all too frequently it is the most poorly taught subject in the course. We 
need to learn a lesson from Germany and France. In these countries the 
secondary teacher is allowed, even encouraged, to specialize, to follow a chosen 
line of study, but he “must show mastery for teaching purposes in at least 
two additional subjects,” and one of the three must always be the vernacular, 
the mother tongue. 
The private or denominational college can also make fairly adequate pro- 
vision for the theoretical professional training of the teacher. Here again we 
are in a position to meet the requirements of the Committee of Seventeen, 
“That definite study be given to each of the following subjects, either in sep- 
arate courses or in such combination as convenience or necessity demands:’’ 
“(a) History of education. 
“1, History of general education. 
“2. History of secondary education. 
“(b) Educational pyschology with emphasis on adolescence. 
“(c) The principles of education, including the study of educational aims, 
values, and processes. Courses in general method are included 
under this heading. 
“(d) Special methods in the secondary school subjects that the student 
expects to teach. 
“(e) Organization and management of schools and school stains? 
“(f) School hygiene.” 
It would be possible for a single professor of psychology and education 
to give the necessary amount of work for this theoretical professional training 
of teachers, but it would be far more desirable to have a professor of phil- 
osophy and psychology and also a professor of education. If one man under- 
takes to give all the courses required, he will be under the necessity of giving 
the subjects in alternate years. This is unsatisfactory, but it is far better 
than not to give them at all.
-P-A-G-E-239
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 235 
It will be necessary to have at least one professor who devotes his whole 
time to the preparation of students for the teaching profession. It will not 
be satisfactory, as a rule, to have courses in education given by instructors 
in some other department. There should be specific preparation on the part 
of the teacher who undertakes to give courses in education. Otherwise the 
instruction will be unsatisfactory and will fail to secure the respect of students 
and of other members of the faculty. 
It is needless to say that the chief difficulty which the denominational 
college experiences at this point lies in the fact that the money is not avail- 
able for the employment of a professor who is competent to give students this 
theoretical professional training. 
The third recommendation of the Committee of Seventeen presents the 
greatest difficulty to the private or denominational college. This has refer- 
ence to the practical professional training of the prospective teacher in the 
secondary schools or elementary schools. 
The committee suggests “that opportunity for observation and practice 
teaching with secondary pupils be given.” ‘The difficulties involved in this 
recommendation were recognized by the committee, and plans were suggested 
for carrying out the recommendation successfully. These plans will be dis- 
cussed with reference to the denominational college. 
“(a) The maintenance of a school of secondary grade that may be used 
for observation and practice.” 
There is just one thing in the way in this matter, and that is money. The 
denominational college has not sufficient income to maintain such a secondary 
school. In a few instances preparatory schools are maintained by the colleges, 
and in such cases practice teaching is possible. Though there is at least one 
college in North Carolina that has maintained a preparatory school for years, 
and this college has also had a professor of education, but there has been no 
practice teaching by the students. In this case the faculty of the college— 
for the college has general oversight of the preparatory school—objects to 
making the school a practice school, and the teachers in the preparatory 
school are likewise opposed to the proposition. There is a feeling that if prac- 
tice teaching is allowed, it will cheapen the school, and that the teaching will 
be done far less effectively than if carried on by the regular teaching force. 
This notion, however, is wrong, for the practice teaching, done under the close 
supervision of the professor of education, would, in many cases, be superior 
to the work of the regular teacher. 
Even though the practice school cannot be maintained, there are other things 
that can be done to train the teacher. There is observation. A considerable 
amount of the student’s time during his last college year should be devoted 
to observation. This observation, in order to be most valuable, must be di- 
rected by a competent person. And yet, even this part of a student’s prac- 
tical training will be difficult of realization, and will necessitate his incurring 
considerable expense at times. Here, at Wake Forest, for example, a student’s 
opportunity for observation is limited to a three-teacher school. If he observe 
a well-equipped graded school, he must go to Raleigh, seventeen miles away. 
But, despite all hindrances and inconveniences, observation of good schools 
should be provided, such observation to include special methods of teaching  
-P-A-G-E-240
  236 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
certain subjects, class management, and the general principles of school 
management and administration. 
Then, again, a student could become assistant to a teacher in the elementary 
school or high school, and not only observe the work of a grade, but he could 
assist the teacher in at least one or two subjects; geography or history, for 
example. The student might spend an entire week or several days or weeks 
in work of this sort, or he might teach a period or more each day for several 
days or weeks. 
To be sure, this arrangement is not ideal, but it will afford the student an 
opportunity to become acquainted with the actual work of the classroom. 
Some of my students have done work of this sort in the Wake Forest public 
school, and derived great benefit from it. 
An occasional hour of practice teaching may be provided. This is not 
satisfactory, for the student needs to feel responsibility for the class and for 
the subject under consideration, and he should teach under school conditions 
that are normal. But if real teaching in a real school is not possible, this 
practice teaching is better than nothing. For example, if the professor of 
education has twenty or twenty-five men who expect to teach, he can at least 
require each one of them to teach a lesson to the other members of the class. 
Such work as this is being done with my students this year. The lesson taught 
last Thursday was a German lesson. It was well planned and skilfully taught 
by a young man who expects to teach modern languages in a high school 
next year. 
There is still another possibility for securing some practice teaching. This 
is not ideal, but the arrangement that will be suggested will do something 
to give the candidate experience in teaching under actual conditions. The 
night or evening school may be utilized. Such a school may be organized, 
if one does not exist in the community, by the professor of education and his 
students. We organized such a school here at Wake Forest about three years 
ago. The school was located in a mill village, about a half mile from the 
college. The classes met three nights a week. Each student was made re- 
sponsible for the teaching of a given subject in a certain class. The work was 
supervised, suggestions were made, the young men criticised their own work, 
and tried to look at the situation from a professional standpoint. The results 
were very gratifying. One of those student teachers, who is now principal 
of one of our best State high schools, told me not long ago that his teaching 
in the night school was the most helpful feature of his preparation for the 
teaching profession. In fact, he said, his practice teaching stood him in great- 
est stead during his first year’s experience in actual school work. 
This practical preparation of the teacher is absolutely essential. As Prof. 
Dewey says, “In the professional preparation of the teacher, practice is not 
in the least intended to supplant theory, but merely to supplement it, to 
vitalize it, to render it useful, and to give the student some training in apply- 
ing it.” 
We must realize that as with the child, so with the teacher, ‘learn to do by 
doing;’ “no impression without correlative expression.” Least harm will 
come from this expression on the part of the prospective teacher when the 
expression is checked up, in other words, when it is properly supervised by 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
  
PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 237 
a competent person. Such a competent person may be the professor of educa- 
tion, the high school principal, or the critic teacher. This competent super- 
vision will prevent costly experimenting on the part of the student when he 
takes charge of a grade or a school, it will furnish a standard by which he 
may judge the quality and effectiveness of his work, and it will in many cases, 
prevent failure. 
To secure the observation and practice teaching just indicated will require 
the closest and heartiest co-operation between the college and the school, 
between the college professor, the superintendent of schools, the high school 
principal, the supervisor, the critic teacher and the prospective teacher. If 
all work together, much can be accomplished, but if any withhold his support 
and co-operation, the best results are impossible. 
It would not be inappropriate, perhaps, to mention just here another one 
of the problems connected with this practical theoretical training. It has 
reference to the demand made upon the time of the professor of education. 
If he gives the courses required for the theoretical training of the student— 
school management and administration, history of education, educational 
psychology and all the other subjects—what time will he have left to devote 
to the supervision of teaching by the student? This is a practical question, 
for the most of the private and denominational colleges cannot afford the 
employment of more than one man for the department of education, and fre- 
quently he is professor of both philosophy and education, or has to teach some 
other subject in connection with the courses in education. 
Another problem that suggests itself just here has reference to the disposi- 
tion of the student’s time. The average student is not allowed to devote more 
than a seventh or an eighth of his time to pedagogical subjects. The schedules 
of recitations are so arranged that the student finds it difficult to arrange his 
schedule so as to allow time for practice teaching or observation without a 
conflict with other subjects. It will be necessary to so direct the work or 
courses of the student that he will be comparatively free during his senior 
year to give attention to purely pedagogical matters. This will be in keeping 
with the arrangement usually made in the case of students of law or medicine. 
The time has come to put teaching upon the high plane it deserves, along- 
side law, medicine, and theology, and to make it as truly professional as 
any other subject. When we do this it will be respected as other professions 
are, and not until then. 
In the discussion of this topic it has been assumed that the majority of 
students sent out as teachers by the private and denominational colleges 
would become principals of high schools or grammar schools, or teachers of 
high school subjects. Therefore, emphasis has not been placed upon methods 
of teaching reading, number work, and other primary school subjects. My 
own judgment is that the average college ought to prepare its students for 
teaching in the schools of secondary grade or for administrative positions, 
and leave the preparation of primary school teachers largely to the normal 
school, where methods, aids and devices play so large a part. That is to say, 
such training belongs logically to the normal school; and at least in our men’s 
colleges very little time should be given to the consideration of methods of 
teaching primary school subjects.
-P-A-G-E-242
    
238 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
Summarizing, then, we may say that the private or denominational college 
can do at least three things in the preparation of teachers: 
1. Give academic training—subject matter. 
2. Theoretical professional training—the principles of teaching. 
3. Practical professional training—the art of teaching. 
THE RESPONSIBILITY AND OPPORTUNITY OF THE PRIVATE 
AND DENOMINATIONAL COLLEGE IN THE TRAINING 
OF TEACHERS. 
Prof. A. L. Rhoton, Georgetown, Ky. 
Nore.—The few comparisons made in this paper between the denominational college and the 
State institutions are for the sake of bringing out some of the more important features of the 
denominational college along the line of teacher training, and not for the purpose of finding fault 
with State institutions. 
Throughout the period of modern history the responsibility for the train- 
ing of teachers has been largely in the hands of private and denominational 
colleges. Within the last few decades the outlook for private and denomina- 
tional schools, and especially of the so-called “small college,’ has been some- 
what discouraging, due to the rapid growth of State institutions, but the more 
recent years their prospects are brightening. This reaction in favor of the 
private and denominational college is an evidence that the people are coming 
to appreciate the work of these schools. 
The principle of universal education first propounded by Martin Luther, 
is no longer questioned. This principle has passed beyond the stage of mere 
theory and is becoming a matter of actual practice. It is called universal 
because it is provided for, and is put within the reach of, and adapted to, every 
person. It is for the normal child and for the abnormal, for the brilliant 
mind and for the weak-minded, for the easily-governed child and for the in- 
corrigible, for those of good social standing and for the outcast, for the 
blind, deaf, and maimed in any way, for retarded children, for anaemic chil- 
dren, for children of all races and under all conditions, and in quite recent years 
we are coming to believe that even criminals are more easily cured by educa- 
tion than by punishment. 
In it all the idea is that every child is entitled to that kind of education 
by which he is best enabled to find himself and to adjust himself to his en- 
vironment. 
This idea of universal education as a practical and available doctrine is 
comparatively a recent one, and with its development, thé pedagogic demands 
are multiplied a hundred fold. The teacher must now have a many-sided 
interest which requires a wide acquaintance with the fields of human know- 
ledge and must understand and appreciate child nature and the laws of men- 
tal growth. The faults of the old method of teaching are too well known to 
claim our attention in this paper. 
For the more excellent teaching we are indebted in large part to that
-P-A-G-E-243
    PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 239 
brilliant line of educators, Rousseau, Pestalozzi, Froebel, Herbert Spencer, 
Horace Mann and others. The ideas of these prophets have little by little 
taken root and as a consequence we have our modern educational principles, 
based on the social and individual nature of the child. Almost anyone could 
“keep school” and pour in or drive in, but it requires a rare order of being to 
properly stimulate and guide the child’s inherent powers. 
In view of the tremendous task of education and of the splendidly equipped 
teachers that are needed, every agency that contributes to the solution of 
educational problems should be welcomed and utilized. In our own genera- 
tion we have heard much about various aims of education, the “bread and 
butter” aim, which looks to the material welfare of the individual; the cul- 
ture aim which has in mind those studies and accomplishments which custom 
or fashion considers the ear marks of the gentleman; the aim of harmonious 
development of all one’s faculties; the ethical aim of the Herbartians which 
would insist that the lower or animal elements in one’s nature should be 
dominated by the higher intellectual and spiritual elements; and then the 
social aim, or as Bagley puts it, “social efficiency.’ There is no doubt but 
that there is good in all these aims. Spencer says that the purpose of educa- 
tion is ‘‘complete living,” in which I think he would include much that is 
given in the more specialized aims. The writer is inclined to agree with Prof. 
Bagley, that ‘‘social efficiency’ should be the ultimate aim of education. 
Bagley sums up the things that should characterize the socially efficient 
person: (1) He must be able to pull his own weight, i. e., he must not be a 
drag on society; (2)\in addition to this he must interfere as little as possible 
with the efforts of others; (3) he must lend his energies to further ‘“differentia- 
tion and integration of social forces which is everywhere synonymous with 
progress.’’ The person who is socially efficient will not wilfully or knowingly 
do anything that will harm another, but, on the other hand, he will keep in 
mind the good of others. Social efficiency includes the morality of Herbart 
and at the same time magnifies one’s larger external relations. It implies 
adjustment, for no one can be socially efficient who is out of harmony. No 
matter how much evil or good there may be in a community, one must work 
in harmony with his environment. This does not mean, of course, that one 
should necessarily do what others do, but that he should by his presence 
contribute to the direction of the existing forces along lines which will result 
in progress. Progress is.a process of evolution characterized by harmony, 
or an ever-changing something due to the presence of an inner force chiefly 
as a directive and inspirational energy working in harmony with all the 
other existing agencies. - 
It seems to me that growing out of this ultimate aim of education, our 
private and denominational coileges find their greatest justification. All 
students who enter institutions of the type which I represent, expect to 
acquaint themselves with the leading departments of human knowledge, by 
taking a liberal dose of each of the fundamental branches, and in consequence 
of this more extensive study their sympathies and interests are broadened, 
and in the light of this broader outlook, they can choose more intelligently 
the avenues of activity to which they wish to devote their energies for life. 
The most important feature of this broader outlook is the social problem.
-P-A-G-E-244
  240 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
From the day a student enters till his graduation, the one thing we try to 
bring out is the relation of the student to the world. His whole program of 
studies and discipline has reference, directly or indirectly to a more efficient 
social service later on. No matter what may be his dreams of honor, fame, 
business or commercial prosperity, etc., when he enters, little by little in the 
process of his development, thesé ideals gradually fade and are replaced by 
higher and altruistic ones, not that the others are abandoned, but that they 
become secondary. 
I lift my hat to the State-supported institutions and almost envy them their 
costly and splendid equipment, their large student bodies, their better salaries, 
and their great possibilities, but these advantages are not an unmixed good, 
and probably there are features in respect to which smaller institutions have 
the advantage. In fact, I think several such features could be named, and one 
of them I shall speak of in particular, the one which more directly affects 
teacher training. In State universities everywhere a large majority of the 
students come from the high schools with their careers mapped out. At 
the start they enter special schools, mechanical engineering, civil, mining or 
electrical engineering, agriculture, domestic science, law, etc., and look for- 
ward in almost every case to individual success, and they turn all of their 
energies in the direction of their chosen vocational subjects. It is largely 
a matter of vocational training and vocational success with little concern 
about what others are doing. In all probability the professors themselves, 
many of them, have not active interest in the development of the students 
beyond their own departments. It seems to me that the best type of altruism 
could hardly thrive in such soil, either among the students or faculty. So 
that, if we adopt social efficiency as the highest and ultimate aim of educa- 
tion, it looks as if the best type of teacher from the social efficiency point of 
view would hardly come from such highly specialized and vocationalized 
institutions as the State universities. 
One might take issue with me here and say that the university gives general 
and liberalizing courses, and this is true, and more, it has courses for teachers 
which require a broad range of subjects; but in spite of this the spirit of 
specialization permeates the life of the institution and is quite pronounced 
throughout one’s university course. All this special work is good, but it is 
not the best type of environment for teacher training, it is not here that the 
highest type of social service develops. 
I shall merely mention two or three other features in which the small col- 
lege has the advantage in teacher training: (1) The personal touch between 
the instructor and student, which almost amounts to companionship, could 
hardly fail to inspire the student with high aspirations to become a good 
teacher; (2) the superb community life of the small college, where all the stu- 
dents are with one mind in the same place, and where they share all in com- 
mon. In such an atmosphere hardly too much could be said in favor of the 
social development, where every fellow becomes keenly aware that there are 
other fellows with equal rights and duties with himself. Such’a life is a great. 
leveling process, selfish interest must be sacrificed for the community interest, 
so that in the course of the four years each grows into the idea that his highest
-P-A-G-E-245
    PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 241 
duty is social. This could hardly be so in a university with a number of in- 
dependent schools and independent interests. 
Also the advocates of the denominational college claim for it a more ex- 
cellent training in individual character, which claim is justified insofar as 
my own experience goes, and yet I do not like to take a position which implies 
such a comparison. 
The denominational college is not without its faults. In the past it has been 
too narrow in its purpose and its curriculum. It has not been in sufficiently 
close touch with life, and often tended to educate its students away from life. 
The mistaken conception all along has been that» the school and life are 
unrelated. The rejuvenation and the revitalization of the work of the de- 
nominational college is in a large measure inspired by the great scientific 
movements of modern times. It looks as if the time is almost at hand when 
the small college may be expected to approach the almost ideal school. The 
religious outlook of such schools is now broadening out into a rich and fruit- 
ful program of social and practical Christianity. One has said that the de- 
nominational college is just now about to come into its own, and I believe 
that it will incorporate in its work all the educational practice which experi- 
ence shows to be the most conducive to social efficiency. 
Henceforth our small colleges will retain the best in their past history and 
incorporate the best from the new education. We are not vocational schools 
except in the larger sense of preparing men and women to be leaders in right- 
eousness and good citizenship. We do not ignore the importance of vocational 
training, and in fact make some provision for it in our junior and senior years. 
In fact, we require every student to specialize just a little, presumably along 
the line of his greatest interest or natural inclination. 
We are also looking out for the needs of the churches and the various 
forms of religious work, including the work of the country church. Our stu- 
dents get training in Sunday school work, Christian association work, young 
people’s society, and more than half of them are engaged in mission study. 
I should say that these activities are voluntary and popular and consequently 
quite effective. Also arrangements are being made for the training of our 
students in music, both organ and voice, looking expressly to service in their 
home churches. All these activities are Christian, not sectarian, and look 
forward to practical Christian service. 
In years gone by the private and denomination college placed consider- 
able emphasis on the culture aim, but during the more recent years this aim 
is giving way to that of so¢ial service. Our work is characterized more and 
more by the missionary spirit, i. e., by a tendency toward unselfish social 
service. The development of this very spirit itself is one of the essential 
qualifications of the true teacher. This, with the wide outlook and the broad 
human sympathies which we try to develop in our students, would of itself 
indicate that our denominational colleges should have a large share in the 
preparation of teachers for the public schools of the State. 
In addition to the general preparation required, most of the private and 
denominational colleges have already provided, or will provide, some special 
education courses for the benefit of those students who wish to take up 
teaching, these courses to be pursued during the junior and senior years.

  242 SouTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
I am not acquainted with the situation generally regarding the certification 
of teachers, but I am sure that in a number of States, private and denomina- 
tional colleges are placed on a par with the State universities in the matter of 
such certification. The recent legislature of Kentucky passed a similar law 
which applies to teachers for the public high schools of the State. The ad- 
ministration of this law is placed in the hands of our State board of education. 
This law virtually places private and denominational colleges in Kentucky, 
which expect to secure this privilege, under State supervision, and in my 
judgment, this very condition will increase the efficiency of these colleges. 
This supervision by the State will stimulate the private schools, which will, 
in turn, react upon the State institutions and result in a general improvement. 
The law just referred to was supported by our State institutions as well as 
by the private colleges, which indicates the harmony existing among our 
educational forces. 
In the atmosphere of such a college where students become acquainted with 
the principal avenues of human activity and with the various social and 
educational problems; where the aim and life of the institution looks toward 
the improvement of social conditions and the betterment of mankind gen- 
erally; where men get a vision, not so much of a trade, or business, or pro- 
fession, but rather of social service; in this atmosphere, I say, our most 
efficient teachers and social leaders must surely grow. 
Notwithstanding the rapid increase of attendance at the State institutions 
of Kentucky, the attendance at our own college has steadily increased for a 
number of years. We have this year seventy-nine in the freshman class, which 
is about double the freshman class of two years ago. This very increase is 
quite probably due to the educational campaigns made in recent years by the 
school forces of the State. 
With the certification privilege that our graduates will hereafter have, I 
should think that we might reasonably expect a considerable increase in 
attendance on the part of high school graduates who desire college training 
in preparation for the teaching profession. 
The remarks made in this paper bearing immediately upon the college 
which I represent, might, with equal propriety, be said about any private 
or denominational college of the standard grade. 
As a closing remark let me venture this prophecy that, as the years go by, 
school boards and people generally, will depend more and more on private 
and denominational colleges for.the supply of teachers and that these in- 
stitutions will come to function somewhat as teachers’ colleges.

Wuereas, The interests of education in the south require a merger of the 
Conference for Education and the Southern Education Association. 
Resolved, 1. That a committee of three, consisting of President Tate, 
with the other two members to be appointed by him, be appointed to confer 
with a like committee from the Conference to consider this question and to

authorities of each in deciding upon the time and place of the next meeting. 
The President appointed on this committee M. L. Brittain and Wm. F. 
Feagin and Dr. John R. Kirk. 
A motion by Mrs. Mary C. Roark, of Richmond College, Ky., prevailed, 
that a permanent committee of three be appointed by the President upon 
“Conservation of Vision.” 
The President appointed on this committee, the following: 
Mrs. Mary C. Roark, Richmond, Ky. 
Miss Linpa Nevitue, Lexington, Ky.

. FIRST CHRISTIAN CHURCH. 
2:30 P. M. 
The meeting of the Southern Educational Council was called to order by 
W. K. Tate, secretary, who stated that a letter from President Abercrombie 
had been received, advising that on account of his pressing duties as a member 
of Congress, he could not be present; and that Vice-President J. H. Phillips 
was detained in Alabama on account of the approaching meeting of the Ala- 
bama Education Association. 
On motion from the floor, Dr. D. B. Johnson, of South Carolina, was 
elected chairman pro tem. 
Dr. Johnson stated that the chief business of the meeting of 1914 was the 
consideration of the report of the committee appointed at Nashville to for- 
mulate the essentials of a State school system. This committee was composed 
of: 
Dr. Joun R. Kirx, Chairman, Missouri. 
Hon. M. L. Brrrratn, Georgia. 
Hon. N. R. Baxer, Alabama. 
Dr. J. A. C. Cuanpuer, Virginia. 
Dr. D. B. Jonnson, South Carolina. 
The chairman was unable to be present, and the report was presented by 
Supt. Brittain. Mr. Brittain stated that the committee had held a meeting 
in Richmond, and had discussed at length the plans suggested at Nashville, 
and such further suggestions as had come to them. They had also held one 
meeting in Louisville and had considered the report jointly with a com- 
mittee appointed from the Conference for Education in the South to consider 
the same subject. 
Dr. Charles L. Raper, chairman of the Conference committee, Dr. T. J. 
Woofter, and other members of the committee, were present at the Council 
meeting and were invited to take part in all the deliberations. There were 
also present a representative audience of educational leaders from the various 
southern States, and on motion, these were invited to participate freely in the 
discussion. The preamble and recommendations which had been prepared 
by the committee were read and discussed for three hours. 
The Council naturally found it impossible to agree on details which would 
be applicable to all the southern States. Whenever agreement was impos- 
sible, the report was amended so as to leave the details to be arranged by each

State in accordance with the wishes of its people and the provisions of its 
constitution. 
The general principles and the section relating to administration as given 
below, were adopted by the Council. The committee was empowered to 
continue deliberations with the Conference committee for the consideration 
of the essentials of a financial system. The section agreed upon by these 
committees is also presented herewith.

The Department of Superintendence met in the First Christian Church, 
with R. L. McFarland presiding. In the absence of secretaries of both de- 
partments, N. C. Hammack, of Morganfield, Ky., was elected secretary 
pro tem. © 
Miss Wil Lou Gray, supervising teacher of Laurens county, 8S. C., made 
quite an extended talk on rural supervision, which was enthusiastically re- 
ceived by all present. Her paper was ably discussed by Dr. Henry Suzzallo, 
of Teachers’ College, Columbia University; also by Supt. Brock, of Richmond, 
Ky. 
Supt. Holland, of Louisville city schools, at this point invited the super- 
intendents to visit the Louisville city schools. 
Mrs. Desha Breckenridge was then introduced and spoke of the famous 
social centre school in Lexington, Ky., which has been worked out by the 
ladies of the Civic League of that city. She said, in part, that in the beginning 
the school was known as Irishtown School, and was doing no good, but under 
the social centre idea, the school has, in two years, come into a place of national 
note and interest. The school maintains a system of manual training and 
social arts, a roof garden or outdoor school, a swimming pool, and a system of 
public laundry. 
After Mrs. Breckinridge finished speaking, Miss Cloud, the principal of 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  250 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
this school, was called for, and she made vivid the working of the school in 
special cases where ordinary methods had failed. 
Mrs. Cora Wilson Stewart then gave the history of her great work in 
Rowan county, Ky., in abolishing illiteracy. She said in part, that the county 
should be made the unit of organization; the teacher must be enlisted and 
persistency followed. 
Mrs. Stewart’s story of her work was received with marked interest upon 
the part of the entire audience. She was asked what these people read after 
learning to read. Her answer was that they read the Bible and the newspapers. 
An interesting paper was presented by Prof. C. J. Brown on the subject, 
“Methods of Training the Untrained and Inexperienced Teachers Now at 
Work in Our Schools.” 
The Conference then adjourned without election of officers. 
THE CITY SCHOOL AS A SOCIAL CENTRE. 
Mrs. Desha Breckinridge, Lexington, Ky. 
In the heart of the Bluegrass, in a poor section of the city of Lexington, 
a little over twelve years ago a playground was opened by the Civic League 
and the Woman’s Club, Lexington organizations. Playgrounds had been 
started then in only two other Southern cities—Louisville and New Orleans. 
The Lexington playground abounded in local color and it was unique; it was 
started in the shadow of a distillery, and out of it has grown, as education 
always should grow from play, a “model school,” as it is still affectionately 
known by those who worked to bring it about. 
“TRIsHTOWN.”” 
The section of town in which this playground was located was popularly 
known as “Irishtown,” politically as “Bloody B,” a precinct which, with 
pain and travail, with violence and blood-guilt, always turned in the Demo- 
cratic majority found necessary in close elections, a precinct whose voters 
looked to the city and county authorities for fitful employment on the roads 
or the streets, or as constables or policemen. Irishtown had been about equally 
corrupted by politics and by charity; there were families that had been beggars 
for generations. But there were also hard-working, ambitious families whose 
only crime was poverty. 
After the second summer of the playground, which had developed into a 
vacation school with cooking classes, with out-of-door sewing classes and 
kindergarten, the Civic League went to the school board, showed them that 
the public school system was passing over the heads of the children of this 
neighborhood who needed it most, and induced them to start a public kinder- 
garten in Irishtown. To this kindergarten one grade was added after another. 
The Civic League kept the playground going in summer, a little manual 
training and evening recreation in winter, and always the men and women of 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 251 
the Civic League kept working for the ‘‘model school,’”’ which had then shaped 
itself in their brains as the kind of public school that Irishtown, and Davis 
Bottom and Spiegel Heights and all that contiguous section needed. And now 
there stands in the place of the one-room kindergarten, the Abraham Lincoln 
School, that is both a public school and a social settiement, of which Dr. 
Earl Barnes, of Philadelphia, has written: “I have never seen a piece of social 
work where the combination of personal and public support, together with 
the general aim and purpose, appealed to me so powerfully as in your school.” 
Crvic Leaaur anp Scoot Boarp Co-orERATE. 
The school board urged by the Civic League, set aside $10,000.00 for a 
school in the “West End,” all that could be spared from a bond issue that had 
to build other schools for white and colored children. The Civic League 
set out to raise the rest, and has now turned over to the school board a plant 
that has cost over $45,000.00. The league is still at work, for the grounds 
are yet to be graded and surfaced and planted, the playground laid out, a 
retaining wall built, and other details completed. The money was raised by 
private subscriptions at home and abroad, the first one coming from Mr. 
Robert Lincoln, the son of President Lincoln, by an “Appeal to ex-Ken- 
tuckians,” and finally by a whirlwind campaign, such as the Y. M. C. A. 
people use. It was not an easy job, for it was hard for the community to 
see that the west end needed such a school as the Civic League planned. 
But the money was finally raised, and the school built and named for Abraham 
Lincoln, Kentucky’s greatest son, and it has become, as the Civic League 
said it would, a model not only for Lexington, but for Kentucky, which is 
having a distinct effect on the public standard of the State. And sometimes 
visitors come from much further away than Kentucky. Dr. Chas. Fordyce, 
dean of education of the University of Nebraska, who visited Lincoln School 
recently, said he considered it the finest example he had ever seen of the 
perfect blending and working together of the public schools and the sovial 
settlement principle. 
Co-oPERATION SIGNED AND SEALED. 
The Civic League, when most of the money was raised, entered into a con- 
tract with the school board. The site was selected, the architect and plans 
chosen, and the school built by a joint committee of school board and Civic 
League; and it was stipulated that, for ten years after the Civic League 
should control the use of the school building for all recreational and educa- 
tional purposes outside the regular school uses. Ten years, it was believed, 
would fix the experiment so that the school board would no longer need the 
Civic League. After a year and a half it is no longer an experiment. It seems 
already impossible that anything so beautiful could perish off the earth! 
Waar Is IN THE SCHOOL, 
The school has a carpenter shop, a kitchen and serving room, a laundry, 
shower baths and a swimming pool, a roof garden with an outdoor school—
-P-A-G-E-256
: 
252 SOUTHERN EpuCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
the latest project—and a room 75 x 40 feet, a story and a half high, which is 
a kindergarten in the morning, a gymnasium in the afternoon, an auditorium 
and theatre at night, and the pulsing heart of the school and the community 
life morning, noon and night of every day. Here the Blue Birds and the Camp 
Fire Girls meet, the Athletic Club, the Dramatic Club, the Choral Club; here in 
the evenings sixty-five girls from the four laundries, the ten-cent stores, the 
bottling houses of the two distilleries of the neighborhood, and from the 
tobacco factories, come for gymnastics and a swimming lesson afterwards. 
Here forty mothers of the mothers’ club meet once a month for health lectures 
and for asocial hour. Here, finally, once a month, about 200 young men and 
girls of the various clubs and classes, with the parents for chaperons, and such 
children of school age as can slip in, gather for the monthly dance that is the 
. social event of the neighborhood. There isn’t any turkey trotting, for the 
edict has gone forth that ‘this ain’t no country club;”’ but there is more of 
real happiness than was found in the many saloons that furnished the only 
public meeting place before the school was built. 
Tue Swiamina Poot. 
Only once did the auditorium lose its attraction for a little while—during 
the very hot season of last July and August, when the swimming pool was just 
opened, when nobody wanted to do anything but swim and to take shower 
baths. Nearly 1,000 showers were paid for in those months, with numberless 
baths to school children for which no charge was made. There are no other 
public baths, no other public swimming pool in Lexington. Railroad men, 
who come into Lexington from a two days’ run, and many other adults 
not directly connected with the school, were glad to pay for the privilege of 
a bath and a swim. As for the children, when the swimming pool was first 
opened the windows had to be nailed to keep them up, until proper regula- 
tions could be established for ages and sexes, and the emptying and refilling 
of the pool. Late in the season even, the swimming teacher had to dogmatically 
limit the number of baths and swims and towels that one child could have in 
aday. And this in a neighborhood where cleanliness had been rarer and more 
difficult to attain than godliness! 
Tue Launpry. 
Not only is the laundry used as a part of the school equipment, but out of 
school hours the mothers of the neighborhood may bring their washing to 
it, and for the payment of ten cents may have the use of stationary tubs with 
running water, ironing boards with gas heaters for the irons, and a steam 
drier. The insufficiency of the water supply is the crying need of the neigh- 
borhood, and the laundry is seldom out of use, a mother sometimes coming 
even at night to finish her ironing or put her washing to soak while her chil- 
dren are having a good time up-stairs.

PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 253 
Tue Reapine Hasir. 
There is a circulating library in the school, which supplies the reading for 
the neighborhood—a neighborhood that did not read before the coming of 
the playground and the kindergarten. 
Ser GOVERNMENT. 
Self government prevails throughout, from the floor committee of young 
men who manage the dances, to the house committee of very small boys 
and girls, who in each grade, care for the schoolroom, and maintain order for 
the teacher. 
Tuer Fresu Arr ScHoou. 
Almost the last thing to be added is the outdoor school. On St. Patrick’s 
Day, 1913, when crocuses and daffodils came out, thirty little children, 
carefully chosen from three schools, came out on the roof garden to do their 
studying and their playing and their sleeping. The school board had bought 
the desks and paid the teachers’ salary. When the Civic League and the 
tuberculosis society counted up on that 17th of March what there was in the 
treasury, when cots and Esquimo suits and blankets and all equipment were 
paid for, it found there was $4.50 in the treasury to feed those children on 
till the 4th of July, when the school was to close. But the ravens provided, 
and the children have been fed every day of the school term since, and tem- 
peratures and pulses have gone down and weights have gone up, and rosy 
cheeks have taken the place of pale ones. This was the third open-air school 
ever started in a Southern city.

The Civic League employs a medical helper, who has charge of the outdoor 
children, follows the work of the medical inspector with the other children, 
goes into the homes of the neighborhood, and keeps a social history card for 
every pupil. It shows scholarship, health, home conditions and sanitation, 
and with a view to proving eventually that these children stay in school longer 
and are fitted to earn better wages when they come out than did their older 
brothers and sisters, it shows the ages at which these brothers and sisters went 
to work, the wages they first earned, and the wages they are now earning. 
Now, there is a secret to every formula. The Lincoln School does its best 
to give away its formula to every visitor who comes; but there is one thing, 
the real secret of its success that it can’t give away—the genius of the little 
kindergartner who supervised the first playground, who is now the principal 
of the “model school,’ and the head of the social work, whom every man, 
woman and child in the neighborhood adores, about whom the school and the 
school idea has so slowly and lovingly grown, that they are entwined in the 
very life of the neighborhood forever.

METHODS OF TRAINING THE UNTRAINED AND INEXPERI- 
ENCED TEACHERS NOW AT WORK IN OUR SCHOOLS. 
Prof. C. J. Brown, Baton Rouge, La. 
Preliminary to a discussion of the main point I would say that it looks 
like poor business to give very much time or attention, the equivalent of 
money, to from three-fourths to nine-tenths of the group of teachers mentioned 
in the heading of this paper. It is well known that relatively few, not more 
than a fourth, of the untrained and inexperienced teachers of any one session, 
will remain even another year; it would seem a better business policy to have 
school authorities, since they must employ a number of such untrained 
and inexperienced persons, to direct their efforts chiefly towards getting such 
teachers to give all their energy and intelligence to their work. It would 
seem wasteful to both school and individual interests to have such tem- 
porary workers give any considerable time or attention to training for an 
occupation they are so soon to leave. 
First, then, I should say, school authorities should employ the largest 
possible proportion among its young, inexperienced, untrained people, of 
those who express the intention of remaining with the work and who seem 
to have some native qualities that go into the making of a good teacher; it 
is to this group that efforts for training should be directed and only from 
such a group will results worth while come. The remaining and much larger 
proportion of untrained workers who are to leave at the end of the session 
should be supervised with the idea of getting the fullest possible service from 
them, I would have them given little attention as to training for future ser- 
vice. 
As the best means for training this smaller group of inexperienced people 
I would say that close inspection and supervision seem to stand first in 
importance. The supervising official should by all means be a person of 
sympathetic nature as well as of fine training. He should inspect closely 
and deal firmly with these young people. The brevity of this paper and the 
abundance of available material elsewhere relating to the work of supervisors,. 
makes it desirable to omit details as to the methods he should use. He 
should have a keen eye for that teacher of native ability and give her special 
attention; he should soon discover the teacher with low limitations and 
bestow little of his valuable time on her. 4 
The summer school offers the next best means for training the young 
teacher. This summer school should continue at least eight weeks and at- 
tendance upon it should be obligatory on the part of those inexperienced 
teachers, because it becomes necessary for the school board to employ. The 
supervisor, at the close of the session, or earlier, should furnish a list of those 
to whom this summer school would be profitable, those of native ability, 
who expect to remain in the work, and school authorities should then require 
their attendance. This is to be preferred, but where such action is advisable, 
attendance of this class of young people should at least be encouraged in every 
possible way.
-P-A-G-E-259
    PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 255 
Periodic teachers’ meetings are a means of much improvement to ambitious 
young teachers; the value lies chiefly in the stimulation and enthusiasm re- 
sulting from contact with good teachers. No scheme of training for inexper- 
ienced teachers should fail to provide for frequent teachers’ meetings. 
Reading courses, carefully outlined and closely supervised, with credit of 
some kind in the way of better salary or an added per cent. to examination, 
have been highly profitable in the way of training young teachers. I would 
not advise such courses unless they are to receive the close attention of super- 
vising authorities; the young person, if left to herself, will get very little of 
direct benefit from the mass of material through which she will thus have to 
wade. 
In conclusion, I would again say that it seems to be in the interest of good 
business to limit the time and money to be expended for the great majority 
of young, inexperienced teachers; it would seem more profitable wisdom 
to give the same efforts to some means of preparation for aspirants to teach, 
previous to their entrance into the actual work. Experience has proven 
that efforts to train the teaching group of untrained boys and girls, in the work 
but temporarily, are almost altogether lost in so far as the schools are concerned, 
because of the fact that nearly all of them drop out before a fruition of such 
efforts to train. The very fact that they do not expect to remain in the work 
is a most powerful influence in counteraction of any effort that may be made 
to train them. 
WHAT SHOULD A SUPERINTENDENT OR SUPERVISING 
TEACHER DO WHEN VISITING A SCHOOL? 
By Miss Wil Lou Gray, Laurens, S. C. 
When a little girl, I planned a first of April joke on an old family friend. 
Getting the soup-tureen from the china closet, I filled it full of hot water and 
started gaily across the street with the make-believe soup. I met my father, 
he objected to the joke, and upon my arguing the matter, he made me drink 
every drop of the now tepid water. Since then I have unhesitatingly obeyed 
the head man—my father at home, and, in this instance, Mr. Tate, my of- 
ficial head—who told me to accept Mr. Graves’ invitation and talk in an in- 
formal manner, on the subject assigned. I don’t deny it’s another dose of 
soup. 
The subject, ‘What Should a Superintendent or Supervisor Do When 
Visiting a School?” will be considered from the viewpoint of a rural county 
supervising teacher, who in South Carolina, is always a woman. 
The first duty, upon visiting a school, is to impress upon the teachers and 
pupils that you have a heart-felt interest in the school, apart from anything 
you may feel called upon to criticise; that you claim each individual school 
as partly your own, and feel responsible for its deficiencies, as well as for its 
development. The keynote of attitude should be ‘“‘our”’—pupils and teachers 
are eager to respond to effort when they once realize that someone is trying
-P-A-G-E-260
256 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
to help them, and are glad to know that they are no longer an isolated school, 
but one of a number trying to attain a certain high standard. 
It is always well for the supervisor to arrive at the school early. If asked 
to conduct the opening exercises, it gives an excellent opportunity for showing 
just how vital those few minutes can be made. Suggestions for future work 
may be offered in this manner: “I know your teacher will take this subject 
tomorrow, and tell you more about it during the week.” In connection with 
the morning exercises, a story, pointing some truth, is always enjoyed by the 
children and places you on a friendly footing. While the children and teachers 
are together, favorable commendation might be given (if possible), and plans 
for the future in which all are interested, outlined—ask co-operation of pupils, 
showing that they are a part of the county system, the success of which is 
dependent on the effort of each pupil. They appreciate the sense of responsi- 
bility and feel in honor bound te do their part if you appear confidently to 
expect it. Impress upon them that they will be judged in comparison with 
all schools in the county. Few times will pupils fail when directed by the right 
kind of teacher. However, it is a melancholy truth that all ideals become as 
idols with clay feet in the hands of a poor teacher. 
The most important work of the supervising teacher is to assist in the 
actual classroom work. This is no easy task, for often the schools are taught 
by inexperienced teachers. In order to help this type, it is absolutely nec- 
essary that the supervising teachers be ready to cope with the most un- 
favorable condition, and be able to present in a convincing manner the best 
methods. While suggestions should be given along all lines, it is better judg- 
ment not to try to correct all deficiences at once, but to concentrate energies 
on some specific branch. In Laurens county there are many pressing needs, 
but reading is universally dull and uninteresting, hence that subject has been 
stressed for the past year, not only in the schoolroom, but also in the teachers’ 
institute and association. 
A thorough investigation of the reading question will reveal many astonish- 
ing facts—a large number of reading classes, the rapid advance from grade 
to grade, the fearful ignorance of the pupils regarding the meaning of words, 
the calling of words without thought, the antipathy for reading, and the early 
age at which pupils stop reading. : 
Think how all this militates against the formation of the reading habit, 
which is the most important factor for education. If the above condition 
exists, the supervising teacher should conduct several typical reading classes 
—namely, the first, third and sixth grades—while this is being done it would 
be well for all the pupils to pay attention. 
Following this should come consolidation of classes. If this is done, as it 
should be, tactfully, the teachers will be delighted, for, of necessity, they 
are burdened with too many classes. Neither the children or the parents 
wili resent the supervisor’s classification, as they would the teacher’s. 
After the regular series of arithmetic classes, the supervising teacher should 
give a drill in rapid multiplication, subtraction, addition, and other funda- 
mentals. Here, as in reading, the children will be found deficient—they will 
be mortified, and to please you and to do as pupils in other schools do, they 
will be willing to devote a few minutes.to such practice each day. The teach- 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
    PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 257 
ing of some kind of farm arithmetic should be encouraged. The tests given 
at our county fair are based on this work, hence serves as an incentive. 
There is a decided tendency on the part of the pupils to advance from grade 
to grade without completing the adopted course. The average country school 
running only seven months, often attempts to cover the ground that a school 
of nine months’ term covers. This is done at the expense of the thoroughness. 
Tf, upon the visit of the supervising teacher, there should be given an informal 
test in history, geography and grammar, the teachers, as well as the pupils, 
would stress thoroughness, and thus discourage the rapid unprepared propor- 
tion. These tests should be oral—taking the place of the regular recitation. 
They should be conducted in such an informal manner that the children will 
not associate the supervising teacher with the dreaded word examination. 
The teacher, however, is not so easily blinded, and seeing the results of her 
work as others see it, is often an eye-opener. 
The supervisor should certainly carry to the schoolroom a store of busy 
work material, which should be given to the little people at intervals, de- 
monstrating to the teacher its great usefulness. If possible, work suggested 
by the day-lesson should be used. The lives of the children will be made 
much happier when hand-work and head-work replaces the present silent 
idleness, or monotonous, day in and day out, task often found in country 
schools. 
In many schools the children are not taught to compose. If the supervising 
teacher would ask all children above the third grade, to write her a one-page 
letter instead of the regular English lesson, it would ‘be productive of good, 
provided the handing in of the letters did not end the recitation. She should 
criticise one or two before the entire class, then tell them that all letters 
would be handed back the next day for correction, the mistakes having been 
marked. When the letters have been correctly written, they should be mailed 
to the supervising teacher. While this is a simple exercise, it will illustrate 
the necessity of applying what has been learned, the combining of classes, 
and the absolute farce of having exercises written, which find their way into 
the fire without the mistakes being pointed out to the pupils. 
It should be seen that a period on the day’s program be set apart for his- 
tory, language, and geography recitations for the little pupil. The teacher 
should be shown just how responsive the children are to such work. As far 
as possible this should be connected with something familiar to the child. 
One of the greatest phases of the supervising teacher’s work is in connection 
with the library. In conference with the teacher, the library list should be 
discussed, and the purchase of suitable books for the children, and not grown- 
ups, suggested. When visiting the school, certain children should be asked 
to read and report on definite books. This will usually be done because the 
child’s curiosity has been aroused by a partial story of the book, and sugges- 
tion comes from one who, while regarded as a teacher, is seen so seldom, that 
the novelty of pleasing doesn’t wear off. The'use of Government bulletins and 
professional magazines should be encouraged. Old magazines, obtained from 
friends, could be carried to the various schools and left in the library or with 
pupils. 
The recess period should not be neglected—while lunch is being eaten
-P-A-G-E-262
  258 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
someone might be encouraged to tell a bit of his experience. The children 
are thus taught to observe and to relate the every-day occurrences, for there 
is no field of observation so rich as the country. A game should follow the 
meal. If you have a school fair, it will be well to base this work on some of 
the “stunts” for that occasion. In Laurens county we give the ‘children, 
through the School Journal, a magazine edited and written throughout by 
the children, a new game each month. Games should form an important 
part of a child’s school life, for where can they learn better the lesson of 
“team work” and co-operation? He who learns to play the game, will succeed 
in life. 
If the children have been dismissed in a disorderly manner, an excellent 
opportunity is afforded at the end of a recess hour to suggest that they play 
soldier and march into the house. 
When possible, the supervising teacher should meet with the patrons 
in the afternoon. This will afford an opportunity to organize a school im- 
provement association among the women. Here, the teacher, supervising 
teacher, and patrons can discuss the welfare of the school, its definite needs, 
its deficiences, its progress. Together they can formulate plans, assisting not 
only in securing better results in the classroom, but in making the school a 
social centre. It is a good plan, when radical improvements are needed, such 
as new buildings, repairs, increased taxes, to remain over night and have a 
meeting so that the business men will have no excuse for non-attendance. 
The afternoon should be spent with the teacher visiting those parents who 
fail to send the children to school, or who send them very irregularly. The 
trustees should be asked to meet the supervising teacher, and observe.on that 
day the work of the schoolroom. 
This affords opportunity for the private talk with the teacher, in which 
criticism should be offered and the following topics discussed: The program 
for the day and, if necessary, its re-arrangement; careful preparation of work, 
relationship to patrons, improvement in arranging the furniture, cleanliness, 
sanitary conditions of the house and grounds, the necessity of joining and 
attending the State and county teachers’ association, arid of regarding the 
work as a profession and not as a passing phase of life. 
The work outlined herein is intended to extend through the entire day. 
Personally, I have tried spending various hours in the schoolrooms and have 
found that results follow more rapidly the all-day visits. A card sent to the 
pupils after each visit commenting on the work, encouraging the backward, 
sometimes by name, and impressing upon children the necessity for good 
work, will be found beneficial. This acts as a connecting link between the 
supervising teacher and the school. 
Finally, there is so much to do, so many schools to visit, so many miles 
apart, so many questions to.ask, so many questions to be answered, so many 
plans to make, so many plans to unmake, that the supervising teacher’s 
brain often feels like a scrambled egg, but of one thing I am always sure, 
that on visiting a schoolroom one should exercise consummate tact, and be 
governed by plain, old-fashioned common sense.

I. THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE RURAL SCHOOL THROUGH 
DEMONSTRATION SCHOOLS. 
T. J. Coarms, of Kentucky. 
There must be a change in the rural schools. There have been very few 
material changes during the last twenty-seven years. The conditions, it is 
true, are better in many ways, but the real improvement is not very great. 
There have been some losses during this period. The teachers at the present 
time are younger than those who taught years ago, and for that reason they 
have less knowledge of life, although they do, in many instances, know more 
about the profession of teaching. 
The two great forces for improving the country schools are the teachers 
and the people. The teachers are themselves the greatest single opposing 
force to progress. Many of them are perfectly friendly to new devices, but 
they are usually new devices in the teaching of the old things. They are 
against the bigger ideas. Education, in their estimation, is still a formal 
matter. The people generally hold the same views. The parents? opinion 
of school is usually of the old kind. Many people have no idea that it is pos- 
sible for the school to do some of the things that are proposed. The people 
were likened to aman who, after seeing the giraffe, turned around dubiously 
with the remark, ‘“There is no such animal.” 
The way to bring better things to many of the people is to “show” them. 
For this purpose demonstration schools have been established. 
Mr. Coates stated that in the second year of his experience as rural school 
supervisor, he asked ten of the most progressive county superintendents of 
Kentucky to try the plan of establishing schools for the purpose of demon- 
strating some of the better things in education. He visited the counties. 
Some counties of the State did not want them at all, although they are anxious 
to get them now. In each of these ten counties ten of the best schools were 
selected for this purpose; thus making a total of 100 schools in the State. 
In the selection of the counties an attempt was made to distribute them as 
much as possible throughout the State as well as to get counties having 
progressive superintendents. The same attempt was made in regard to the 
selection of schools in the various counties. In selecting the schools, there 
was a special attempt to secure schools that might at some future time, be 
consolidation possibilities. The schools selected represent various types of 
environments. 
Another thought guided the selection of the schools. Attempts were made 
to get schools having a strategic value in disseminating thought in their 
localities. Thus, in Whitney county, there is a large Baptist school to which 
many students come from various parts of the State. In Warren county 
is the western normal school, and in Madison county is the eastern normal 
school. Other counties selected were Rowley and Union. 
The ten schools for demonstration purposes were selected by the county 
superintendent. He called together the ten teachers and talked matters 
over with them. Each one of these schools planned to take on one or more 
of the new things which had been proved worth while. These features would
-P-A-G-E-266
    262 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
be the improvement of the school grounds, improvement of sanitary condi- 
tions, introduction of some sewing or other industrial work, etc. In some 
of the schools of Kentucky there is a very large attendance and the practice 
has been introduced in a few places of having the larger pupils help the teacher 
with some of the younger children. This help would be largely given in the 
form of drill work. The attendance in some schools reached as high as ninety 
children. 
In brief, the plan is the selection of some school in which some new work 
can be shown with success and then introduce whatever new features will be 
most useful to that particular school. In some cases the mothers were brought 
into school, thus establishing a closer relation between the school and the 
home. These 100 teachers were in close touch with their county superintend- 
ents and also with the rural school supervisor. Reports were made every 
month and the rural school supervisor would tabulate a composite report and 
send it to all the teachers. The supervisor visited everyone of the 100 schools, 
which was no easy task, as they were scattered over the whole State and some 
of them were located in inaccessible localities. The reports of these visits 
were sent to the county superintendent and frequently this report was pub- 
lished in the newspapers. In this way an attempt was made to get the peda- 
gogical blood flowing. 
In some counties special supervisors are employed who go into the schools 
for the purpose of helping the teachers. These supervisors are usually located 
in the counties where these demonstration schools are located or in counties 
adjoining. By means of these special supervisors and demonstration schools, 
the teachers learn what can be done in the way of teaching and in the way of 
making the school a greater influence in the community. In some instances 
the county board of education has employed substitute teachers in order that 
some of the regular teachers may have visiting days to enable them to see 
some of the better work done in the demonstration schools. 
Mr. Coates stated especially that these schools should not be thought of 
as model schools, but simply schools in which some special work is shown 
in a better way-than it is usually found. During the last two years there were 
100 special supervisors employed to assist the county superintendents in 
their work in Kentucky. 
Out of the 100 teachers, seventy-five made good. The great function of 
these schools is to show the people and the teachers how some things can and 
should be done. 
J. L. Bonn, Arkansas. 
Mr. Bond took up his work as rural school supervisor two years ago, al- 
though he had been at work in the State department of education previous 
to this time. Arkansas has an optional county superintendency. The people 
first vote on whether or not they are to have county superintendents at all, 
and if they decide to have a superintendency the superintendent is elected 
later. Two years ago there were only eight counties that had county super- 
intendents actively engaged in supervision work. His first work was to get 
in touch with these superintendents and build up the schools in these counties 
in order to popularize the county superintendency with the people of the
-P-A-G-E-267
PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 2682 
State. A campaign was carried on in these counties and the work was used 
as a basis for argument in establishing county superintendencies in other 
counties. i 
The principal work of the rural school supervisor was to help the county 
superintendents help themselves. Ten schools were selected in each of these 
eight counties and the general plan followed was the one described by Mr. 
Coates, though perhaps it was less systematized. Most of the schools selected 
were one-room rural schools. Effort was made to centralize the forces of 
the improvement of these schools, and in this way work in agriculture was 
introduced in places and clubs were organized. Sanitary conditions were 
improved in many places. The State board of health issued a bulletin on 
school attendance, which was taken up and greatly improved by the issuance 
of perfect attendance certificates. 
The purpose of the work was first of all to help the county superintendents 
themselves, and second, to help the teachers by means of meetings and other 
literature. A bulletin was issued monthly and sent to the teachers. 
As a result of this campaign other counties began to consider the advisability 
of establishing county superintendencies and at the present time there are 
fifteen counties out of the seventy-five that have regular superintendents 
devoting their whole time to the work. Five other counties will very likely 
come in soon. As in Kentucky, consolidation has resulted in places from the 
work done in these demonstrative schools. 
In Arkansas, the people elect the county superintendent, but he is paid 
out of the State fund. He must have at least twenty-four months’ experience 
in the county. Sometimes the school directors oppose the establishment 
of the county superintendency, for the reason that it seems to take away 
some of their power and prestige. There are about 5,000 school districts 
in the State, and from 15,000 to 20,000 school officers. 
  Il. THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE RURAL SCHOOLS THROUGH 
LOCAL SUPERVISION. 
G. W. Reavis, Missouri. 
Mr. Reavis distributed some outlines on which much information was 
given regarding the subject of his discussion. He stated that Missouri has 
the district system of school administration but that they are working toward 
a county unit system with a county board of education electing the county 
superintendent. Thirty-six consolidated districts have been organized in 
less than ten months. The county superintendent lays out the boundaries 
of these districts. 
Mention was made of the school garden movement of the State. One of 
the difficulties encountered is that many teachers change each year. There 
are thirty-five school gardens in one county and the number in the whole 
State is large. Mr. Reavis showed how some of the common school subjects 
were co-ordinated in the teaching of agriculture. The school gardens are not
-P-A-G-E-268
  
  _ 264 SOUTHERN EpUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
used for commercial purposes as the products are not sold. Some discussion 
arose among the members regarding this plan, some maintaining that unless 
the school garden was as good as anything that could be seen in the com- 
munity, it would not win favor among the farmers. Mr. Reavis stated that 
it is difficult to manage the school gardens in such a way that the products 
could be sold, owing to the fact that tHe schools were not in session long enough 
in the summer. 
Many teachers of Missouri attend the summer school and thus increase 
their qualifications. The statement was made that the different school 
subjects should be used as tools in teaching things that people need to know. 
Mr. Reavis spoke of the grade card which has been prepared by the State 
department of education.” These cards were distributed at the Conference. 
Eighty counties in the State (out of 102) are using these uniform cards. 
Special attention was called to the home work which the children did. This 
home work is graded by the parents and Mr. Reavis stated that according to 
his estimate, ninety-five per cent. of the parents grade the cards. The 
great value of this system is that it brings about co-operation on the part 
of the parents and teachers, although, in some instances, the grading may not 
be accurate. Another value is that the parents learn to appreciate the dif- 
ficulty of grading children’s abilities. According to the estimate of the super- 
visor, there are from 150,000 to 200,000 children in the State using the cards. 
Mr. Reavis spoke of the State fair school, which is free to one boy in each 
county, selected by a competitive examination. Sixty-one boys were in at- 
tendance last year. The State pays for the State fair school, which lasts five 
days. It is held the first week in October. 
N. R. Baker, Alabama. 
A year ago only four counties in the State had county supervision, that is, 
only four counties had superintendents devoting their entire time to school 
work. Their salary consisted of four per cent. of the moneys that passed 
through their hands. 
The law has now been changed so that forty counties are under the new 
law, and have adopted the new plan of paying salaries. The average salary 
now paid to the county superintendents is $1,725.00. They are elected by 
the people and many of them are good men. In Jefferson county, the county 
superintendent is paid a salary of.$5,000.00, and in many of the other counties 
the salary is quite large. Many of the county superintendents have clerical 
help and assistant superintendents are provided in some of the counties. 
(Mr. T. W. Smith, the assistant county superintendent of Montgomery 
county, was in attendance at the convention.) There are ten special negro 
supervisors in the State. One county has two assistants. Jefferson county, 
in which Birmingham is located, has eight assistants. The assistant super- 
intendents are elected by the county board of education. One county has a 
trained nurse as assistant superintendent. 
Mr. Smith, assistant county superintendent, reported the following facts 
regarding Montgomery county. The auto is used in the supervision of schools. 
The roads are excellent. Many teachers have from fifteen to twenty-five
-P-A-G-E-269
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 265 
pupils. The salaries range from $70.00 to $75.00. Schools are sometimes 
eight miles apart. 2 
N. C. McDonatp, North Dakota. 
There are fifty counties in North Dakota. The county superintendents 
are elected every two years by the people. Primary and general elections 
are held. An office deputy is provided in each county. Thirty-three counties 
have additional supervisors. The county superintendent must be a resident 
of the county and have taught in the county. The average salary is $1,656.00. 
The deputies are all appointed by the county superintendents. In some of 
the counties there are agricultural and industrial supervisors who are work- 
ing as allies of the county superintendent. They are appointed and paid 
by the agricultural college board. Thirty-six counties have such super- 
visors. 
Jackson Davis, Virginia. 
Virginia does not have county superintendents, but division superintendents 
instead. A division may include more or less than a county. These super- 
intendents give most of their time to the administrative affairs of the schools, 
that is, the business side of education. Mr. Davis spoke largely of the intro- 
duction of the industrial work into the schools, such as cooking, sewing, 
school clubs, community work, etc. The consolidation movement is making 
rapid progress in Virginia. In one county practically all the schools are con- 
solidated. Henrico has a traveling principal of small schools. There has 
been somewhat of a reaction against centralization in the assembly, but it 
has very likely reached its height. 
Ill. THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE RURAL SCHOOLS THROUGH 
CONSOLIDATION. 
N. R. Baxer, of Alabama. 
Of course, the small school must go. The large school has come to say, 
“Be watered and give increase.” i 
There are many reasons for consolidation, Alabama has 600,000 of them, 
of which number about fifty per cent. are males and fifty per cent. females. 
This 600,000 is the number of cowntry children in the State. 
However, we may offer fifteen brief arguments, as follows: 
1. The schools can be graded better because there are not so many grades 
to each teacher. 
2. Better teachers can be secured for well-graded schools, because the 
teacher feels that she can do better work in a few grades than in many. 
3. It makes it possible to support high-school grades and thus serve the 
secondary educational interests of the community, resulting in keeping 
pupils in school longer and in keeping them under the home roof. 
4. It makes it possible to teach such cultural subjects as music and drawing. 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
  266 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
5. It makes it possible to teach vocational subjects, such as cooking, 
sewing, agriculture and bench woodwork. 
6. It makes it possible to devote more time to reading, language, spelling 
and writing, the just now neglected subjects. 
7. It results in longer terms and more regular attendance. 
8. It enlarges the community, gives wider social contact, and broadens 
the horizon of every individual. 
9. It fosters lyceums, literary societies, debating societies, reading circles, 
libraries, athletic sports, agricultural clubs and other vitalizing agencies. 
10. It results in better equipment for the building and grounds, greater 
safety and better health for the pupils, and greater real economy for the pa- 
trons. 
11. It makes the country school equally attractive with the town school. 
12. It becomes a social and civic centre. 
13. It is not so easily susceptible to the fluctuations of population. 
14. It encourages good roads. 
15. It is more easily supervised by officials and yields more readily to ef- 
fective supervision. 
But since surveys and investigations are the order of the day, I shall sub- 
mit the results of an inquiry into the conditions with respect to consolidation 
in my own State, in an effort to bring something concrete to this discussion. 
There are but seven consolidated schools in the State of the advanced type, 
that is, where transportation is afforded. This number would be greatly increas- 
ed at once had we: the right under the laws of the State to use public funds for 
transportation. And it should be understood that where this type of con- 
solidation has been secured, the transportation is financed outside of public 
funds. 
These seven small consolidated schools have but ten wagons and about 
twelve private conveyances engaged in transporting the pupils. Eleven small 
schools were discontinued. Some of these were housed in disreputable build- 
ings, and taught by poorly equipped teachers. 
The aggregate distance made by wagons daily was found to be sixty-eight 
miles or seven miles for each wagon. This is, however, presuming that the 
wagon does not return during the day. In that event, the average distance 
would be fourteen miles per day. 
The average monthly expense of these wagons is $34.50. 
The value of all buildings before consolidation is estimated at $8,200.00, 
the value of the consolidated buildings at $33,750.00, an increase of 300 per 
cent. 
The estimated value of equipment before consolidation was $1,925.00, 
after consolidation $3,775.00, an increase of 100 per cent. 
The total annual cost of the schools before consolidation was $10,975.00. 
The total cost after consolidation was $11,520.00, to which may be added 
the cost of transportation, $3,450.00, making a grand total of $14,970.00, an 
increase of forty-three per cent. 
The enrollment of all schools before consolidation was 531, after consolida- 
tion 683, an increase of twenty-six per cent. 
The average length of term before was seven months and one week; after,
-P-A-G-E-271
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 267 
eight months and two weeks, an increase of eighteen per cent., or a total in- 
crease in days of attendance of forty-eight per cent, which is greater by fifty 
per cent. than the increase in cost of maintenance. 
To the question, ‘How do the patrons like the plan?’’ the answers, ‘‘Not 
a complaint,” and “Carried away with it,’”’ were given. 
To the questions, ‘“How do pupils like it?” such replies as, ‘Tickled to 
death,” and “Can’t get them there too soon,” and “Only one case of tardiness 
by the wagon all session,’’ were made. : 
One principal said that two more schools were arranging to come next year; 
one a fourteen-pupil school, and the other a six-pupil school, each five miles 
away. This will be a financial saving, as no additional teachers will be needed. 
During the present year the number of one-room schools in the State to 
be discontinued is fifty, and the number of union schools to be formed is 
twenty-eight. 
There are in the State 130 points where conditions are now favorable for 
the organization of schools of three or more teachers. 
There are already 123 three-teacher schools, and 343 two-teacher schools. 
It is mostly from this latter class that we propose to secure our three-teacher 
and larger schools for the future, making the centres strong and the flanks 
weak. 
We are to meet the county superintendents this week and ask them to 
select strong teachers insofar as they can for their large schools, on the general 
plan that the principal shall be a man who is not only able to do the academic 
high school work, but also to teach manual training, including such work 
as applied to the construction of things needed on the farm, and also to be a 
leader in athletics, and the organization of boys’ clubs. 
The first assistant should be qualified to teach the domestic arts and manual 
arts in the grades, and organize the girls canning and poultry clubs. 
The second assistant should be a leader in the social life of the community 
insofar as it can be directed through the school and should be well qualified 
to do primary work and lead the games of the small children. 
Until we secure authority from the State government to allow local taxa- 
tion of districts and transportation at public expense, for which we are de- 
voutly laboring, we must be content with such meagre results as we have 
herein portrayed. 
IV. IMPROVEMENT OF THE RURAL SCHOOL THROUGH STAND- 
ARDIZATION. 
U. J. Horrmay, Illinois. 
The Illinois school system is the most democratic system found in the 
country. The school district is the unit of the system. Each district is 
independent of every other district. The county superintendent is an ad- 
visor of the teacher and the school officers. The State superintendent is 
the legal advisor on educational matters. Each district has three school 
i 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
  268 SOUTHERN EpuCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
officers. ‘There are 11,000 districts in the State and in the neighborhood of 
50,000 school directors. The State has 102 counties. 
Thirty years ago the county superintendents of the State formulated a school 
guide. Ten years ago this was adopted by the teachers’ association and quite 
generally used. The county superintendent is a busy individual. His work 
has been to visit all the teachers, to operate the schools and to conduct the 
examinations. His work has largely been with the teachers and children, 
and not to any great extent with the school officers. When Mr. Blair, the 
present superintendent, came into office in 1907, a pamphlet was issued re- 
garding the management of the one-room school. This pamphlet took up 
the plan for school buildings and equipment. A diploma was granted to schools 
coming up to the standard set by this bulletin. The county superintendents 
suggested that a door plate be issued so that passers-by should see that the 
school was up to the standard. This was done. The schools that come up 
to the standard are inspected by the supervisor of the country schools upon 
the invitation of the county superintendent. About ten schools can be in- 
spected in a day, and, as a rule, the school directors are present when the 
inspector is making his visit. The trips are usually made in automobiles. 
A score card is used. The inspector advises with the directors in case there 
are improvements necessary. This system is of great benefit to the county 
superintendents and also to the teachers. Meetings for school officers are 
held in some towns and counties, and these do much to help disseminate 
knowledge regarding school management, but frequently they are not well 
attended. The effect of this standardization upon the community is quite 
marked. The children are talking about it and in this way the parents be- 
come interested. 
The first year 150 schools were standardized. The second year, 300; the 
third year, 600, and now there are 1,800 standard one-room schools. 
After the State supervisor has standardized the schools, the county super- 
intendents report every year. The State department pays for the diploma 
and also for one-half of the automobile hire. The school must have at least 
seven months. The teacher must be doing at least fair work. We have vis- 
ited ninety counties out of 102. The progress of standardization depends 
largely upon the activity of the county superintendent. Some of them are 
not tactful and do not know how to meet men. The standardization is fre- 
quently done by installments. 
We believe in the country school. It is possible to have the best kind of 
school work done in some of these little country schools. 
At this point quite a discussion followed regarding one-room country schools 
and the consolidated schools, several of the members present taking exception 
to the statements made by Mr. Hoffman regarding the efficiency of the 
small school. 
L. C. BrogpEn, North Carolina. 
Mr. Brogden touched upon the diffculties in standardization, calling at- 
tention to the fact that there is a difference in the assessed valuation and 
wealth of various districts. It is therefore difficult to require the same 
standard for all districts. Standardization has also the tendency of lessening
-P-A-G-E-273
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 269 
the community initiative and effort. He mentioned also that the system 
of standardization is likely to make the work too mechanical. It is difficult 
to use the score cards in measuring the real efficiency of a school. The ten- 
dency of standardization is very often to defeat its own purpose. 
V. IMPROVEMENT OF THE RURAL SCHOOLS THROUGH COM- 
MUNITY ACTIVITIES. 
J. H. Bryrorp, of Virginia. 
Mr. Binford discussed practically the use of the schoolhouse as a com- 
munity centre. 
The beautifying and improvement of the school plant is a part of this 
problem. The literary societies, debates and paid entertainments which 
are being given by the school pupils do much to increase the community 
interest in school, as do also amateur plays and school entertainments. The 
400 schools of the larger towns all have commencements and some of these 
extend over a period of from two to four days. Teachers frequently bring 
in speakers from the outside, and these talk to the people on educational 
subjects. In many of the 5,000 one-room schools, such speakers were secured. 
In some of the counties a list of speakers were secured. This list includes 
persons living in the community and also persons from State institutions 
and departments. The services of those who go from the State institutions 
are free, and in case local speakers are secured the expenses are paid by the 
localities. 
Through the leadership of the social and civic league organization of the 
State, four general meetings are held during the year. The first of these 
is held in the fall, and is known as patrons’ meeting. Programs are sent out 
from the central organizations and these are carried out either by the local 
leagues or by the schools. A Good Roads meeting is held during the winter. 
A Health Day is observed throughout the State and last year 100,000 copies 
of the health program bulletin were issued by the State Department of Health. 
A Better Farming meeting is held during the latter part of the year. These 
bulletins are issued during the year. 
VI. IMPROVEMENT OF THE RURAL SCHOOLS THROUGH INDUS- 
TRIAL SUPERVISION. ‘ 
Jackson Davis, of Virginia. 
This work began about six years ago. The first county in which it was 
tried was Henrico. Now there are about thirty counties in Virginia doing 
the work, and perhaps from 140 to 150 in all the Southern States. The in- 
dustrial teachers are working with the county superintendent. They get the 
negro people together, and the first thing that is usually done is the improve-  
-P-A-G-E-274
  270 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
ment of the school itself. Through inducements of various kinds, graded 
schools have been established in some places. The aim has been to create 
in the colored people a respect for work and a confidence in their ability to 
do things. The effect of this work upon the colored people is noted by the 
remark made by a colored man who said, “We colored people can do anything 
that we try to do.” 
Through this movement much has been done by the colored people them- 
selves to improve not only their schools, but the general conditions in the 
home. The school becomes a centre from which information is disseminated 
throughout the community. Exhibits of various kinds are being held in the 
schoolhouses. School gardens are being managed in connection with some of 
the schools. Home garden clubs are organized. In the South it is possible 
to have a garden which produces something most of the year. The colored 
people have been taught to put up their food in jars, so that in many cases 
the living is much better as a.result of the work done in the school. 
ADDRESS BY HON, P. P. CLAXTON. - 
United States Bureau of Education. 
About sixty-two per cent. of the school children of the country are attend- 
ing rural schools. Because of this large number, the improvement of these 
schools is one of the most important problems of education. 
The improvement of the country school is not an impossible task. In 
many ways the situation of the country communities is more hopeful than 
that of the cities. The country people are not so averse to improvement as 
many seem to think. City schools have their disadvantages as well as the 
country schools. The country school is more flexible than the city school, 
in that the administration is not so complex. 
Mr. Claxton referred to the topics which had been outlined for discussion 
on the program. He spoke of the value of demonstration schools, and em- 
phasized the thought that we do things by imitation. When anything has 
been successfully accomplished in one community, it is a powerful argument 
in trying to get other communities to do the same. The school should take 
cognizance of the fact that it is itself but a little part of the child’s education. 
A comparatively short time of the child’s growing years is spent in the school- 
room, and he is therefore being influenced extensively by other agencies. 
The great problem is to get the efforts of the school so directed that it will 
co-operate with the home and other institutions to the greatest possible 
extent. The interest of the school activities should especially be centered 
in the home, for it is here that we touch life. As an instance of the school 
keeping in touch with the home life was cited the school at Poplarville, Miss. 
It is especially important that the teacher should be in touch with life in 
order that the instruction in school may be as natural as possible and the 
children taught in terms which they can appreciate. The commissioner sug- 
gested that a teacher’s home and farm should be a part of the school. It
-P-A-G-E-275
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 271- 
is necessary not only that the teacher should know things, but that he be 
able to do things and thus demonstrate to the children under his care and the 
people of the community the best methods of doing things. Too often Ber- 
nard Shaw’s statement is true, that, “Those who can, do; those who can’t, 
teach.” 
One of the greatest problems connected with the improvement of country 
schools is the preparation of the teachers for their work. We are coming more 
and more to regard it as true that if the State assumes the responsibility of 
teaching the children, the State must also train the teachers for the public 
schools at public expense. The schools at the present time, as a rule, are not 
doing the work that they should do. They are not sufficiently in touch with 
life. In the improvement of schools we should keep in mind that reform comes 
from below. It is the people themselves that must become interested. 
“Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth in the next generation 
—or the next.” 
The schools can be made better by improving the course of study. In 
considering a course we should carefully consider the two questions, first, 
what is needed to be taught, and second, what can be taught. The needs 
of the people should be carefully considered when a course of study is made, 
and we should also be careful to adapt the subject matter to the develop- 
ment of the children. ‘i 
In rural communities especially, it is necessary that the children be taught 
the elements of agriculture in such a way that they become familiar with 
the principles underlying the different processes. The organization of corn 
clubs and canning clubs is good as far as it goes, but it is necessary to do more 
systematic work. We should ask ourselves the question, “What does a man 
need to know as a man, as a citizen and as a farmer?” 
Dr. J. H. Dinuarp, New Orleans. 
Secretary of the John F. Slater Board. 
It is the teacher that makes an education. The school and the parapher- 
nalia that go with it may help, but after all the success of the work depends 
upon the personality of the teacher. We need more money spent on the lower 
education than the higher. If we compare the per capita expenditure for the 
two, we find that the elementary schools are not getting their fair share. The 
greatest share of money spent for educational purposes should be spent on 
the elementary and secondary schools. 
Dr. Dillard mentioned that he had seen some of the country schools and 
pronounced them very unsatisfactory. He laid a great deal of blame to the 
apathy of the people. He said that the people may think they believe in 
universal education, but in reality they don’t.

THE PREPARATION OF TEACHERS FOR RURAL SCHOOLS. 
H. W. Focur, U. S. Bureau of Education. 
Mr. Foght discussed briefly the preparation of teachers for rural schools. 
He said that we have gone through a period of exploitation and we are now 
entering upon a period of husbandry. The training schools need to consider 
the fundamental problems of country life, and in this way adapt the schools 
more to the needs of the times. There are new problems and we need new 
leaders in the open country. The country cannot come into its own without 
this leadership. The school should endeavor to relate everything to the soil, 
so that the people may learn to love it and understand it. 
Country life must become more wholesome and attractive and the farmer 
must get a reasonable return for his labor, if country life is to become what it 
should be. Farming must be made a better paying proposition. 
As a rule, the teachers in the country schools are very inadequately trained 
for their work. Investigations have shown that less than seventeen per cent. 
have a reasonable professional education, and less than eight per cent. can 
be said to be professionally trained. However, more institutions are taking 
up the work of training teachers than ever before. The State agricultural 
colleges are helping to furnish teachers, and the normal schools are also be- 
ginning to do some of this work. Five years ago there were only two normal 
schools that were attempting to prepare country school teachers, while now 
there are eighty-nine, although, perhaps, not more than thirty have depart- 
ments of rural education. 
At least three things should be kept in mind in preparing teachers for 
country school work. 
1. The teacher should be a community leader and hence needs to study 
especially the country environment. In the training we should continually 
keep in mind the environment in which the teacher is to work. 
2. The teachers who are being trained should learn something about the 
new kind of country school with its organization and management. The newer 
ideas of rural education should be instilled into those who are going out to be 
community leaders. 
3. The course of study needs to be adapted to the needs of present-day 
rural life. The teacher should become a master of the subject matter that he 
is to teach in the school. 
Mr. Foght touched briefly upon the school system of Denmark, where the 
tenure of the teacher’s service is much longer. He mentioned one school 
that he had visited where the man had been teaching fifteen years, and he 
expressed the desire to continue in the work as long as his predecessor who had 
been teaching in the same position thirty-four years. 
It is especially important that in their training the young people be inspired 
with the possibilities of country life development. 
Emphasis was laid upon the fact that the farmer’s school should be rooted 
to the soil. 
In improving the course of study, Mr. Foght suggested that in orderto
-P-A-G-E-277
' PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 273 
simplify matters, some subjects be thrown out altogether and that in the 
elementary school we should not go- above the eighth grade. 
In some places there is an attempt to teach a smattering of algebra, ge- 
ometry, etc. We should give more time to the essentials and to the subjects 
dealing directly with the country life interest. We should also be careful 
not to make our teaching too material in its nature, but to leave room for the 
spiritual. In the training of the child, there should be a co-ordination of the 
head, hand, and the heart. 
REPORTS OF COMMITTEES. 
(a) On THE Work or DemonsTRATION SCHOOLS. 
We recognize in the demonstration school or school for special demon- 
stration purposes a splendid way of showing the people in a definite and 
concrete way what a school can do for a community. There is no better way 
to win people to any new movement or idea than by actually showing how 
that particular thing can be done. 
In school work, as in every other line of activity, the people want to be 
shown, and they want to see for themselves. We need in our work, much of 
this practical demonstration work—demonstrations that indeed demonstrate 
and convince; hence, stimulate and inspire. 
Therefore, we strongly commend and advise that the demonstration school 
idea be used where it is possible and practicable to make use of this agency 
or means in our work. All such demonstration work should be along intensely 
sane and practical lines, and of special value to the school and community 
in question. 
J. L. Bonn, 
T. J. Coatzs, 
Committee. 
(b) On Locat SupERvIsion. 
It seems to be the opinion of the State Supervisors assembled that there 
should be a much closer local supervision of the school than has hitherto 
existed in the majority of the States. In addition to meeting larger educational 
needs, promoting better educational policies, and informing the people of 
needed changes, and securing full community co-operation, there should be 
close supervision of the teaching work, a continual process of school better- 
ment, a constant effort to make the school function vigorously in community 
life, and a much more careful attention to records. 
To this end, there should be in each county, township or parish, as a mini- 
mum supervisory force, a superintendent of schools, and under his direction, 
a supervisor of schools, a director of agricultural education, a director of edu- 
cation in household science and arts, and an office clerk. In a large county, 
the maximum force might be a superintendent and an office clerk for the whole 
county, and a supervisor, a director of agricultural education, and a director 
of education in household science and arts in each of several divisions of the
-P-A-G-E-278
  274 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
county, these divisions to be made with reference, partly to location and area 
and partly to social and economic conditions.

(c) On ConsoLIDATION. 
1. Definition—A consolidated school is one that is a combination of one 
teacher rural schools or the equivalent in sufficient number to provide the 
community with an efficient and well-graded school answering its general 
educational needs. 
2. We endorse the consolidated school as one of the greatest single factors 
in rural school improvement, because, when compared with the one-teacher 
rural school, its major benefits are as follows: (1) Better attendance, including 
longer terms; (2) better trained teachers, including a larger number of expert 
supervisors; (3) better school work in the grades below the high school; (4) 
better high school privileges at a minimum cost, including the enrichment of 
the course of study by country life subjects; (5) better working organization, 
providing equal educational opportunities for all the children of all the people, 
regardless of their occupation or financial condition; (6) better civic social 
opportunities—that is, a better organization of communities’ activities, and, 
therefore, the formation of higher civic ideas.

Committee. 
(d) On STANDARDIZATION. 
As fundamental principles of standardization we recommend the following 
items, viz.: (1) Minimum material equipment; (2) minimum qualification for 
teachers, including or looking toward a degree of physical training; (3) closer 
and abler rural supervision; (4) compulsory education, or a high rate of enroll- 
ment based on enumeration, and a high rate of daily attendance, based on 
enrollment; (5) a minimum length of school term; (6) an approved State and 
local course of study. It is agreed that in the work of standardization 
we cannot get beyond requirements for material features until schools are 
adequately supervised by State supervisors of rural schools.

(e) ON THE PREPARATION OF RuRAL TEACHERS. 
We, your committee on the preparation of rural teachers, beg leave to 
make the following report: 
American rural life has passed through its period of pioneering and house-
-P-A-G-E-279
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 275 
hold economy type of farming, and it is striving at this time to rid itself of 
the evils incident to land exploitation and all that goes with it. Indeed, a 
re-organization is at hand which aims at nothing short of a new rural com- 
munity life on the foundation of permanent husbandry farming. This calls 
for a new leadership in rural communities such as is now seldom found there; 
and this properly directed school education alone can furnish in fullest mea- 
sure. 
In the process of change from pioneers to a settled people the small schools 
of the early day have, in many sections, become retarded and find it difficult 
to serve the purpose for which they were originally shaped. 
The times demand a new kind of school, which shall answer the needs of the 
community where reached. It must furnish the greatest measure of culture 
and the most hopeful idealism, and at the same time provide a technical and 
practical preparation for farm pursuits. 
The new farm school—whether this be a well organized one-teacher school 
or a thoroughly graded consolidated school—calls for a new kind of teacher, 
professionally prepared, who shall understand the difficult problems of present- 
age life and shall have the right vision of this life and be willing to live it in 
the midst of the country community. 
To be definite, such teachers should (1) be community leaders; (2) be 
masters of the subject matter taught, and (3) have a strong modern rural 
school organization and administration. 
Unfortunately, many of the schools which should, of right, furnish specific 
training for these teachers, have in the past not seen their way clear to do so; 
but have been content to let the country districts take such inexperienced 
teachers of general preparation as saw fit to begin their teaching careers in 
the open country or who, perhaps, could not find a foothold elsewhere. 
Under these conditions, therefore, 
Be it Resolved, That it is the sense of your committee and this representa- 
tive gathering of school supervisors, that we urge the State normal schools 
and other schools whose province it is to prepare elementary and secondary 
teachers to organize, as soon as practicable, distinct and complete departments 
for the preparation of rural teachers, and that we further urge such agricul- 
tural colleges as do not now offer professional preparation in agricultural edu- 
cation, to add a professional staff to their faculty, to the end that the future 
agricultural teachers in our farm schools may have a pedagogical as well as 
technical foundation for successful work; and, finally, that we urge the im- 
portance of establishing schools or departments of schools in which country 
life leaders and agricultural experts of every kind may be prepared for their 
important work.

(f) Mernops or Traintna THE UnTRAINED TeacHers Now at Work IN 
THE Country ScHoots. 
Summary of Suggestions Made by W. K. Tate, State Supervisor of Rural Schools 
of South Carolina. 
While the process is subject to many limitations, the training of the teacher 
at work possesses the great advantage that she is actually confronted with a 
situation in which her success or failure depends on her ability to put into 
practice correct methods of teaching and school management, and in this 
receptive mood will assimilate rapidly any idea which promises to help her. 
This instruction must be presented in a very concrete, usable form. The 
factors, which in our experience, have been most productive of results, are: 
1. The County Supervising Teacher. 
The county supervising teacher visits the school of the novice at the begin- 
ning of the session, helps her organize her school, classify her pupils, make 
her daily program, and demonstrates correct methods of teaching, especially 
with the beginners. A day spent by a skillful, tactful supervisor in this way, 
will frequently revolutionize the methods of an untrained teacher. 
2. The Demonstration School. 
Every county should have several country schools under the charge of 
especially efficient, experienced teachers. The untrained beginners should 
be given an opportunity to visit these schools and observe the work. 
3. The Teachers’ Manual. 
The Teacher's Manual should not be merely an outline of the course of 
study. It should constitute an elementary pedagogy of the country school 
and should offer concrete suggestions adapted to the particular needs of the 
State for which it is designed. The teacher who has never studied the prin- 
ciples of education should find in this manual some rather definite answers 
to the interrogations which crowd upon her during the strenuous days of her 
early teaching experience. 
4. The County Institute. 
The short term county institute, held just previous to the opening of the 
school year, gives the county superintendent and supervising teacher an 
opportunity to correct many of the mistakes which would otherwise be made 
by untrained teachers. 
5. The County Teachers’ Association. 
The programs of the county teachers’ associations should deal with the 
practical workings of the schoolroom. They should offer opportunity for 
free conference between the teachers themselves and between the teachers 
and the supervising officers. These programs should frequently include 
model lessons with classes of children followed by free discussion. }
-P-A-G-E-281
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 277 
6. The Teachers’ Reading Circle. 
The teachers’ reading circle, which is in use in most of our States, offers 
to the young teacher an opportunity of enlarging and organizing her ex- 
perience. 
7. The Summer School for Teachers. 
The summer school for teachers has played a very important part in the 
education of the rural school teachers of the South. Thousands of our teachers 
have, through these schools, been given an opportunity of studying educa- 
tional principles and practices, and of fitting themselves for increased effi- 
ciency. 
(g) On Community Activitins. 
With each passing year the school must become a more important factor 
in the life of the community. It must attract not only the little child but the 
youth, and broaden its work so as to include all the interests of the pupil, 
whether those interests be found in playground, home or farm. Finally, 
the school must plan to attract and benefit every adult in the community. 
From the standpoint of the pupils, the school should have: Courses in 
agriculture, domestic science, and manual training; public debates and ama- 
teur plays; school exhibits and fairs; and organized play, including county 
field days. The schools should encourage the organization and direct the work 
of corn and canning clubs. All the student activities enumerated above are 
closely interwoven with the social and economic life of the community; and, 
therefore, must necessarily challenge the attention and interest of all citizens. 
From the standpoint of the adults, the schoolhouse should be open at 
least one evening each week for lyceums, free lectures, discussions of civic 
and economic questions, and for social and recreational gatherings. In 
order to carry out the program there should be organized in each school a 
community club consisting of all the adults of the community. This organ- 
ization should adopt a constitution, elect officers, hold regular meetings, and 
outline each year a program of work for community improvement. Such 
an organization holding its meeting in the schoolhouse, would add to the social 
life of the community, broaden the interests of the farmer and his wife, de- 
velop a leadership sorely needed in the country, and would gradually place 
the burden of community upbuilding upon the people themselves rather 
than upon outside forces. 
The wider use of the school presupposes a new type of teacher; for if the 
course of study is to be broadened and if, in each school, a community club 
is to be organized, then the teacher must be a community leader familiar 
with and fond of country life and qualified in every way to direct this larger 
work of the country school. Normal schools and other institutions training 
teachers, should provide courses in rural education.

SUPERVISORS. 
We recognize the necessity of making the rural schools more useful in 
building up a better rural civilization, and we recognize the fact that the 
limitations of the average country school are such that the teacher can hardly 
break away from the traditional character of work without personal aid and 
demonstration from outside sources. 
1. We therefore endorse the work of the county industrial supervisor 
in introducing the arts pertaining to home making, cooking, sanitation, and 
farm life into the rural schools. 
2. We recommend that such a supervising industrial teacher be employed 
for the entire year. 
3. We recommend that club work, such as the organization of boys’ and 
girls’ clubs, and demonstration in growing and canning fruit and vegetables, 
be a part of the work of this teacher; and that such a teacher should promote 
citizens’ leagues to organize and improve the social life of the community, 
as well as to assist in improving school facilities. 
4. We recommend that this teacher be employed by the county school 
authorities, and work under the direction of the county superintendent. 
5. We recommend that the State Supervisor co-operate with the county 
superintendent and assist in planning and directing this work. 
6. We endorse the work of the Jeanes Fund in co-operating with the county 
superintendents in employing supervising industrial teachers for the negro 
rural schools of the South. 
7. We endorse all philanthropic efforts to supply State and county super- 
vision looking towards the betterment of the rural schools, but we believe that 
eventually all such supervisory work should become a part of the public school 
system.

The joint session met at 2:30 Wednesday afternoon, in the 8. 8. room of the 
First Christian Church. 
In the-absence of the president and secretary of the Department of Normal 
Schools, the officers of the Conference on Teacher Training presided. 
A resolution was introduced and adopted urging that the proper authority 
merge these two departments into one. 
Following the suggestion found in the program the time of the meeting 
was devoted to the discussion of the thesis, ‘Teacher Training Agencies in a 
State System of Schools.’ The discussion was lead by Dr. Carter Alexander, 
of Peabody College for Teachers, Nashville. 
The following propositions were read as submitted by the committee ap- 
pointed for that purpose: 
1. Adequate provision for the training of all classes of teachers should be 
an integral part of any complete State system of schools. 
2. This training should in all cases include both academic and professional 
courses, with observation and practice teaching. 
3. This system must include as its chief agency adequately supported, 
properly equipped and expertly manned State normal schools of sufficient 
number to meet the demand. The primary purpose of these schools is train- 
ing teachers for the common schools of the State, both rural and city. Fun- 
damental courses should extend at least two years beyond the preparation 
ordinarily obtained in the accepted four-year high school. Many special 
   
-P-A-G-E-284
  280 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
courses will be required in increasing numbers for various special teachers 
and supervisors. 
4. State universities or colleges with adequate departments of educa- 
tion are necessary for training high school teachers, principals and super- 
intendents. No graduates of colleges should be granted certificates to teach 
without professional courses, and these certificates should mention specifically 
the subjects on which persons to whom the same are granted have made 
special preparation for teaching. A minimum of three professional courses, 
each covering three hours per week for the college year, should be required. 
5. A single State university or college cannot meet the demands, and 
other colleges must, therefore, help in the work of training high school teachers 
and principals. Similar standards and similar certification privileges should 
be granted as in the case of State universities. 
6. Specially selected State-aided high schools must provide teacher- 
training courses for rural school teachers. Only one or two such schools 
should be located in one county, or possibly only one for several counties at 
first. These schools would be supervised by State officers and provided with 
well trained teachers. 
7. Approved summer schools of at least six weeks should be provided in 
all educational institutions that especially prepare teachers. The certifi- 
cate laws should be revised so that every teacher who is ambitious enough to 
attend summer sessions anywhere in the country may obtain full credit for 
work watisfactorily done. Such credit should include renewal of certificate, 
without further work; excusing from attendance on the county institute; 
and excusing from examination in appropriate subjects for a higher certi- 
ficate, without fees. 
A letter from President R. L. Jones, regretting his inability to attend the 
meeting, was read, and the committee for formulating plans for standardiz- 
ing high schools, of which Mr. Jones was chairman, was continued. 
On motion the present officers of the two departments were re-elected.

HOW MAY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS BEST KEEP IN 
TOUCH WITH THEIR GRADUATES AND FORMER 
STUDENTS IN ORDER TO ASSIST THEM IN 
LOCAL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT? 
F. M. Bralley, Director Department of Extension, The University of Texas. 
The form in which the subject is stated clearly implies that it is the duty 
of educational institutions to render assistance in matters of local community 
development. The modern idea of an educational institution is that it shall 
render service not merely by instructing and lecturing in the classrooms,
-P-A-G-E-286
  282 SoUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
but also by making contributions to community welfare and development, 
throughout the commonwealth. This is especially true of educational insti- 
tutions which.are supported by the taxes of all the people, and are thereby 
put under obligations to render back to all the people helpful service in their 
affairs. It will be accepted, I think, as fundamentally true that’ in rendering 
service to the community and to the State, educational institutions should 
be inclusive rather than exclusive; and should therefore seek to assist not only 
their graduates and former students, but the entire citizenship for community 
betterment. 
The following are some of the ways in which educational institutions may 
assist their graduates and former students, as well as other people, in pro- 
moting community development: 
1. By organizing associations of their alumni and former students and by 
holding annual meetings of the associations at the institutions. At these 
annual meetings regular programs should be carried out dealing not only 
with college and university activities, but also with some of the larger prob- 
lems of community and State welfare. Where the alumni and former students 
of any educational institutions are sufficiently numerous, community, county, 
or district associations should be formed, and meetings should be held quar- 
terly, or oftener if practicable; and topics of community welfare should con- 
stitute a part of the program of each of the meetings. For all community, 
county, district, or State meetings of the alumni and former students, the 
resources of the college or the university, including the laboratories, the li- 
braries, and the faculty members, should be available. 
Further, the alumni association of each institution should, where practi- 
cable, publish a monthly or quarterly magazine, which should of course con- 
tain interesting information about student and faculty activities, past and 
present, and should also contain articles devoted to the needs of the State 
and of the communities. These articles should be contributed by members 
of the alumni association and former students of the institution, by faculty 
members, and occasionally by other people. The work of the alumni asso- 
ciation, both in its meetings and in the publication of its magazine, should 
encourage graduates and former students to develop into wise, capable, and 
unselfish leaders in the social, the educational, the religious, and the economic 
development of community life. 
2. All educational institutions, and especially those supported by the State, 
are established and maintained for the public good, at least presumably; 
and faculty members should ever be on the alert to find ways and means by 
which to make contributions to the good of society and for opportunities to 
direct the attention of students to ways in which said students may, after 
they leave the institutions, serve in a large and broad spirit the betterment 
of community life, and to the resources of the college or the university that 
are available for, and may be utilized in, community development. Students 
should be encouraged to write back to the institutions for advice and help 
on the important questions of community welfare, and it should be the busi- 
ness of the institutions to render prompt and efficient service when requested 
to do so, if it is within their power. By this means students and the public 
generally will be brought to realize that “no man liveth unto himself;” that
-P-A-G-E-287
     PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 283 
educational institutions are established and maintained not alone for those 
who enter their classrooms, but also for the public at large; that all educational 
institutions in a democratic government are deeply indebted for good will, 
for moral support, for financial backing, and for the right to exist to the com- 
munities of the commonwealth; and that this indebtedness may be discharged 
in part by the means just mentioned. 
3. Educational institutions whose scope of work is sufficiently broad and 
comprehensive and whose resources are relatively adequate, should, as a means 
of assisting graduates and former students, as well as other people, in efforts 
at community development, establish departments of extension. In a gen- 
eral way educational institutions fulfil their obligations to the people by 
educating in resident work young men and young women and by sending them 
back into their home communities carrying with them the culture of a broader 
outlook and a more intelligent comprehension of the problems of life; the ex- 
pert knowledge and the skill acquired through professional training as home- 
makers, business men, teachers, doctors, lawyers, and farmers; and especially 
in the inspiration, ambition, and ability for unselfish service as citizens—the 
intangible and priceless asset of higher education. . This indirect service for 
the whole people of the State is, however, not sufficient. The constant aim 
of educational institutions should be to broaden the scope of their work with 
the ever-enlarging and broadening interests of the commonwealth, and to 
extend their. benefits in a more direct way to every citizen and to every com- 
munity* within the State. This can be done most effectively through the 
establishment of departments of extension. A large number of the univer- 
sities and the colleges of the country have established such departments, and 
are thereby rendering a large and helpful service in community and State 
development. The divisions or kinds of extension service attempted by the 
different colleges and universities of the country of course differ according 
to the scope of work, the financial support, and the spirit of the respective in- 
stitutions. The University of Michigan during the past year received requests 
for nearly 1,000 extension lectures, to be delivered in that State, but was able 
to provide only 325 lectures. These lectures were classified as follows: (1) 
educational, inspirational, 72 lectures; (2) cultural, 118 lectures; (3) educa- 
tional information, 135 lectures. These lectures touched and dealt with 
practically every phase of literature, science, art, engineering, medicine and 
surgery, law, pharmacy, and dental surgery, ‘and reached approximately 
75,000 people. This University has alumni associations organized in prac- 
tically every county in the State, which are frequently visited by university 
lecturers. Evidently extension lectures are a means of assisting not only the 
activities of graduates and former students in community development, but 
all public-spirited people. The University of Wisconsin has more than 6,000 
women and men taking work in correspondence instruction, the courses 
covering practically every phase of university instruction, as well as including 
some of the more practical and technical phases of business education. Several 
colleges and universities render important assistance to communities through 
the work of their bureaus of municipal research and reference. The work of 
these bureaus frequently covers important phases of sanitary, social, and
-P-A-G-E-288
  
  284 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
political life in the community. Service of this kind is frequently rendered as 
an aid to graduates and former students interested in community development. 
The University of Texas, through its department of extension, which was 
established four years ago, has been singularily successful in rendering assist- 
ance to graduates and former students, as well as citizens generally, in import- 
ant work for community development. And for this reason I give you here a 
brief outline of the work of the Department of Extension of the University of 
Texas. The department embraces seven divisions, as follows: 
1. The Division of Correspondence Instruction: This division offers courses 
in the languages, mathematics, economics, government, psychology, educa- 
tion, law, engineering, domestic economy, business training, accounting and 
preparation for teachers’ certificates, and approximately 2,000 people in the 
State during the current year are availing themselves of this form of in- 
struction. 
2. The Division of Public Welfare: This division goes into the field and 
investigates the economic conditions of the State with a view to collecting 
reliable data for use as a basis in efforts to improve economic conditions. 
In this work such subjects as the marketing of farm products, the organiz- 
ing of agricultural co-operative enterprises, the establishment of rural credit, 
the promoting of better farm management and farm finance, are investigated 
and promoted. 
3. The Division of Public Discussion: This division assists in organizing 
and directing declamation, debate, oratorical and athletic contests*in the 
public schools throughout the State. It also, through the package library 
service, furnishes to schools, organizations, associations, and reliable citizens, 
package libraries on many of the important current subjects of the day. 
Graduates and former students utilize the package library service to a con- 
siderable extent, and manifest great interest in the declamation, debate, 
oratorical and athletic contests held in each of the counties, then in each of 
sixteen districts, and finally at the State university. 
4. The Division of Home Welfare: The work of this division relates to the 
large and important problems of the home-maker, and seeks to dignify and 
make more potent and effective the American home in all of its aspects. The 
lecturers of this division visit women’s clubs, teachers’ organizations, farmers’ 
meetings, and other organizations throughout the State, assist in conducting 
better country life and educational campaigns, and deliver lectures and give 
practical demonstrations in the economic, the hygienic, and the aesthetic 
aspects of the home. The division also issues bulletins for free distribution 
to graduates and former students, and to the public generally. 
5. The Division of Information and Exhibits: This division of the depart- 
ment of extension prepares and displays exhibits of the activities and the 
work of the university, and of many of the large community and State enter- 
prises, at the the State fair and at many of the more important county fairs. 
It also keeps in close touch with the country and village public schools of the 
State, and renders assistance to them in the matter of furnishing bulletins 
and help on such subjects as sanitary and hygienic schoolhouses, the beauti- 
fication of school grounds, the consolidation of country public schools, the 
teaching of agriculture, manual training, and domestic economy in the public
-P-A-G-E-289
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 285 
schools. It is this year conducting a scientific study of the country public 
schools of the entire State, and in this study it is making an educational sur- 
vey of a number of typical counties and typical country public schools. 
This work has aroused State-wide interest, and graduates and former students 
have rendered every possible assistance. 
In this division a specialist devotes his time to giving assistance in the 
organization and the work of the university home and school leagues, or social 
centers, at the public schoolhouses throughout the State. The work as under- 
taken perhaps differs in some degree from the social centre work advocated 
and promoted elsewhere in the country. It attempts in practical and effective 
ways to bring about the active and sympathetic co-operation of the home, the 
school, the church, and the other resources of the community, for the im- 
provement of the social, the educational, the religious, and the economic 
aspects of country life. In others words, an effort has been made, and we 
believe, successfully, to adapt the social centre to the village and rural com- 
munities, to incorporate into the social centre work some of the more im- 
portant economic aspects of country life. The bulletin issued on this subject 
sets forth how such organizations may be effected, what activities the mem- 
bers of such organizations may profitably and successfully engage in, and 
places the resources of the University of Texas at the disposal of such uni- 
versity home and school leagues as may be organized. The activities in which 
the social centres may engage touch and give help in developing the social, 
the recreational, the educational, and the economic phases of community 
life. The bulletin also sets forth the kind of service which the department 
of extension of the university may render to such social centres; and this 
service, briefly stated, consists in furnishing leaflets, literature, suggestive 
programs, package libraries, and other forms of help, including lectures and 
practical demonstrations by university professors and special lecturers on 
topics of interest and value to the people, especially on all important phases 
of better country life. The plan includes that of providing a one-week school, 
at which lectures will be given on farm and farm life problems, on community 
co-operation for social, educational and economic betterment, and on the 
fundamental phases of home welfare, including practical demonstrations in 
cookery. 
The department of extension formally launched this work a little more than 
two months ago, and the amount of interest and enthusiasm manifested in 
all parts of the State, and the readiness with which university, home and school 
leagues have been voluntarily organized, indicate conclusively at this time that 
the service in this respect meets the demands of a large and important element 
of the citizenship of the State, and it is believed that this service will ac- 
complish permanent good in community betterment throughout Texas. In 
this form of service graduates and former students have offered to their com- 
munities help that is really worth while; and they feel free to call for it. It 
means a permanent community institution for community good. 
6. The Division of Public Lectures: In the division of public lectures the 
university undertakes to provide competent and impartial speakers, chiefly 
from among its faculty, to present to the people the great questions of the 
day, including interesting phases of literature, science, and art. It is not 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
  286 SOUTHERN EpucATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
the purpose of these lectures to be amusing; the attempt is to present, in a 
popular and attractive form, a definite amount of reliable instruction. 
7. The Division of Child Welfare: This division investigates local con- 
ditions affecting children, and assists in plans for bettering the conditions 
affecting childhood. The hygienic and sanitary conditions of schools have 
been given much study, and through letters and lectures help is given to school 
boards in planning new schoolhouses and in remodeling old ones to make 
them more hygienic. The feeble-minded and delinquents have been studied 
and assistance given in drafting laws to care better for them. Numerous other 
studies have been systematically pursued. 
The University of Texas, through the work of its department of extension 
and of its alumni association, has been most successful in rendering aid to 
its graduates and former students in community and State development; 
but in all of its work, it has manifested the same interest, the same enthusi- 
asm and the same lofty purpose in rendering help to those who are not its 
graduates and former students. The whole people of the commonwealth 
are the constituency of the university, and the university’s ambition is to 
render genuine service in community development to all the people. 
THE CHURCH. 
Rev. J. A. Burns, Oneida, Ky. 
A community divided against itself cannot stand, just a double-minded 
man is unstable in all his ways. The various agencies in a community must 
co-operate if success is to be achieved—they must work together, not against 
one another. 
These agencies may be classified as belonging either to church work or school 
work. Of course, there is a vast amount of mental training inseparably 
connected with religious work, and a vast amount of religious training insepar- 
ably connected with school work. 
The state of development in any community is the measure of the personnel 
of its citizens. The people of a community will have the kind of things they 
want—houses, horses, farms, churches, schools, roads, clothes, amusements, 
food, drink, ete. 
It follows, then, that these various agencies can best work together for 
community development by uniting their efforts to create good citizens. 
In doing this each agency should walk worthy of its own calling, abide in its 
own calling, and leave other things to the particular agencies to which they 
belong. 
The primary function of a church is to teach religious truth—the truth 
concerning God and his dealings with men in terms of the gospel. This 
involves all the doctrines of theology, and should be just as complete and 
comprehensive as possible. Much learning of this kind will never make men 
mad, but the lack of it will leave them at the mercy of many fads and fancies.
-P-A-G-E-291
    
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 287 
This teaching of religious truth should be done through the pulpit and the 
Sunday school. 
The church should place in its pulpit a man called of God as Aaron was— 
a man who can rightly divide the word of truth, and who does not shun to 
declare the whole counsel of God. 
The man who really fills a pulpit will find little time for anything else. 
His message is to the souls of men and the success of every effort for commun- 
ity development depends upon his efficiency. Carlyle said that the greatest 
thing about any man is his religion, even his no-religion. This statement 
is true. What can the Christian associations do, the schools, the clubs, the 
co-operative agencies, if they have to work with men who are religious il- 
literates—men who neither know nor care anything about God? All these 
agencies have a perfect right to demand efficient service from the church. 
In view of this tremendous responsibility, the preacher must give atten- 
tion to reading, to the study of the word and prayer, and must not entangle 
himself with the things of this life. It will require six days in the divine pres- 
ence to prepare him to stand in the presence of his people for one hour each 
Sunday, and the souls of his people can ill afford to have that hour shortened 
to twenty minutes by the introduction of operatics and advertisements. 
If the preacher discharges his duty to God and man he will find little time to 
serve tables, to be a chaperon, a “‘Ladies’ Home Journal,” a trained nurse or 
a bulletin board. 
The church needs to recognize, also, its dependence upon the various 
agencies for community development. Just as the success of the community 
depends upon the efficiency of the church, so the success of the church depends 
on the development of the community. The church must not be an enemy 
but a friend—the light of the world, the salt of the earth. The contribution 
which the church makes to education, to business, to politics, to sociology, 
is the moral character of citizenship. The contribution which she receives, 
or should receive, from these sources, is mental training, prosperity, equitable 
laws and peace. 
But let us never forget that the work of the church is fundamental. No 
institution can stand except it is builded on the foundation which the church 
contributes. An irreligious citizenship will never develop community interests, 
but wars, and rumors of wars—social wars, political wars, financial wars, 
labor wars, continual strife to establish and maintain selfish interests at 
the expense of community peace and prosperity. 
These realizations are just as necessary in city as in country. In fact the 
country builds and feeds and clothes’ and peoples the city. The king, himself 
is served by the field. The country church needs the strongest, sanest, most 
devout preacher because the country church is the very heart and life of all 
community development. It must furnish the moral stamina necessary to 
re-invest’ productive labor with the dignity and respectability which it has 
been divested of, and restore to the laboring man his primeval heritage on the 
very highest plane of life. It is not written, “In the sweat of thy face shall 
others eat bread,” but it is written, ‘He that will not work neither shall he 
eat,” and “My Father worketh hitherto and I work.”

HOW CAN VARIOUS AGENCIES BEST WORK TOGETHER FOR 
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. 
C. R. Titlow, West Virginia University, Morgantown, W. Va. 
(f) Untversity Extension. 
Community development depends greatly on the amount of available 
. money and the getting together of local organizations and agencies. 
To increase the amount of money of a community, it may be necessary 
to secure more products from the farm, to improve the farm and home man- 
agement and to establish a better system of marketing and better markets. 
The getting together of local organizations and agencies is naturally pro- 
duced through an effort to increase the finances of individuals or of the com-
-P-A-G-E-293
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 289 
munity, and through a desire aroused to improve the interests of the home, 
the church, the school, and the community. University Extension, which 
now consists largely of itinerant educational work in agriculture, should, 
through its agricultural experts and rural workers, be able to do two things: 
first, to provide the help sought by each and every rural organization or in- 
dividual to increase the local finances in order that more money may be avail- 
able for the betterment of rural life; and second, as a recognized State agency, 
unconsciously unite all agencies of a community in a common effort. Many 
agencies are at work in the same community, all striving to render a worthy 
service. The service rendered by one agency often conflicts with the service 
of another. Sometimes, where there is no conflict of service, there is the lack 
of sympathetic harmony which leads to a spirit of competition. Each agency 
tries to excel and each tries to win the highest honors. They may all lose sight 
of the service to be rendered. Thus time and energy is wasted, the community 
development is hindered, and a worthy cause suffers. 
All agencies will co-operate in their efforts if there be centered in the 
university extension department, as a State agency, all forms of itinerant 
educational work for the rural districts. It will become the one spring from 
which all streams receive a constant supply, the one great wing under which 
all agencies may shelter. 
This permits the department to assist and advise local leaders in all rural 
movements and, to unite the efforts of all rural agencies. Besides, it will be 
the means of encouraging every rural organization in extending its efforts to 
a larger service. Other State institutions, as normal and preparatory schools, 
county and district high schools, will be encouraged and assisted to hold agri- 
cultural and home economics extension courses and conferences for rural 
people. Home project work will be encouraged through the agricultural 
classes of local institutions by a system of credits honored by the university. 
Thus, rural workers and leaders will be found in each agricultural class, who 
will have an understanding of the various agencies at work and who will be 
in a sympathetic relationship to a union of purposes. The home projects 
may consist of work required of members of the boys’ and girls’ clubs or it 
may be of a more scientific nature and become a demonstration to the com- 
munity. The county and district superintendents of schools, by appoint- 
ment or mutual understanding, may be the leaders of boys’ and girls’ clubs. 
They may assist this work incidentally while conducting school work and 
devote the summer months to the same. If this is a part of the university 
extension work, the superintendents of the public schools, who are always 
glad to be allied with the university, will work earnestly for the community 
interest and in harmony with all other local agencies. This, in turn, will 
make a much more efficient school for rural life. 
The county agricultural agents and the county women agents for girls’ 
clubs, who should be directly responsible to the extension department of the 
university, may become scientific advisors and spiritual guides to the local 
organizations. These local agents and the State leaders of extension work 
may very naturally assume leadership in the organization of local leaders 
into an effective group for the correlation of effort in developing the rural 
life of the county. The ministers, the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. workers, 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
    290 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
bankers, doctors, and other professional men and women, and the leading 
farmers and farm women who are so nobly assisting with the development 
of better. country life, are either graduates of universities or colleges, or of a 
class who appreciate higher institutions of learning, and are not only glad 
to be assisted and guided by the extension workers, but will aid them in 
bringing together all the agencies which are working directly or indirectly 
for a better country life. 
As the county organizations and other agencies for rural betterment in- 
crease, it will become more and more necessary that there be co-operation 
and correlation of effort among them. For this purpose it will be highly 
desirable that there be a council or group of representatives including the 
leaders of the various institutions and organizations concerned, such as the 
representatives of the county federation of churches, the Y. M. C. A.’s, 
Y. W. C. A.’s, the federation of women’s clubs, the granges or farmers’ unions, 
the county school superintendents, county boards of health, county farm 
bureaus or agricultural societies, and kindred organizations and institutions 
that are working for a better country. The extension department, where it 
has county agents, may very properly be the instigator of such an organiza- 
tion and may continue to be the guiding force in the development of its work. 
The exact organization of such a council of country workers should depend 
entirely upon local conditions, the exact nature or method of organization is 
not essential. In one case it may be an adjunct of the school system; in 
another, it may be connected with the county agricultural society or farm 
bureau, but in whatever way it may be formed, it should be seeking to de- 
velop country life. 
By the correlation of effort that may be secured by such a council and by the 
co-operation of all existing agencies, there may be brought about such a de- 
velopment of the churches, the schools, the women’s organizations, the boys’ 
and girls’ clubs, the young men’s and young women’s Christian associations, 
the granges or farmers’ unions, etc., as to result in the creation of a new era 
in the life of any county. Through regeneration of this kind, children will 
grow up in a new atmosphere and with new ideals. Through the work of the 
schools being related to that of the home and through their club organizations, 
they will learn to recognize and will naturally develop leadership among them- 
selves, and will covet the advantages of a high school and college education. 
Thus, through these agencies the community will develop its own leadership 
and its young people as they finish their courses in high schools and univer- 
sities will return to assume their share of responsibility in further develop- 
ment of the country life.

LEADERSHIP FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES FROM OUR INSTITU- 
TIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING. 
Miss Jessie Field, New York City. 
The South may well be proud of the spirit of service which her colleges 
and universities are building up. Not long ago I visited the University of 
Wisconsin, and found the girls there more keenly interested than ever before 
in doing something for the girls in their home neighborhoods. I was eager 
to know what had caused this added earnestness and on asking, found that 
the impetus has come from a Southern young woman who had come to do 
post-graduate work. She had caught her vision of service to rural commun- 
ities from the president of the institution she had attended in Mississippi. 
“Almost every day in chapel our president used to tell us how much we 
owed to the folks back home, because we had this chance of going to college.” 
She said, “Why, you just couldn’t help getting in earnest about it.” 
The Young Woman’s Christian Association in higher institutions of learn- 
ing is working to interest students in rural problems. In several hundreds of 
colleges, classes to study country life have been organized. In many places 
the students have gone out as part of the social service work of the association 
and helped. schools and communities near the college, to start playground 
activities for the children, to hold mother’s meetings, and to start Sunday 
schools and other forms of activity for the neighborhoods. 
The most popular plan for rural service for college women in the United 
States is known as the “Eight Week Club.” During the second semester a 
preparation class in practical preparation for rural leadership for girls is held. 
Those desiring to lead a club for girls in their home communities during their 
vacation in the summer, join this class. In the University of Kentucky a 
large number of girls are voluntarily taking this work to prepare for leader- 
ship. In Mt. Holyoke College, 135 girls are following a splendidly helpful 
course. In fact, several thousand college women in the United States will 
go to their homes next summer with the desire in their hearts to pay the debt 
they owe to the girls who have not had a chance to go to college and they will 
be trained for giving their- leadership intelligently. 
These “Eight Week Clubs” are held with the purpose of leading country 
girls in study, work, play and community service. At the end of the summer, 
reports are sent in, telling what has been done. The college girls who have 
led such clubs and send in satisfactory reports, receive certificate of commenda- 
tion for community service from the National Board of the Young Women’s 
Christian Associations. The student association having at least ten leaders 
doing such work, also receives a certificate for social service. 
Extracts from the best reports of “Hight Week Clubs” leaders are published 
and within reach of all the college women of the United States who are inter- 
ested in rural work. In this way, each year more leaders are interested. As 
the number of students who become interested in volunteer leadership in the 
country always depends, to a large measure, on the spirit of the institution 
which they are attending and the interest and help of the president and faculty

members, we bespeak for this plan of helping college women to pay the debt 
they owe in leadership to the girls and young women at home, your earnest 
and enthusiastic co-operation. 
THE RELATION OF THE COLLEGE TO COMMUNITY DEVELOP- 
° MENT. 
RESOLUTIONS PREPARED BY THE COMMITTEE. 
Wuereas, Preparation for life in all its phases is conceded to be the purpose 
of education; 
Wuereas, Some of the colleges of the country are failing to touch and uplift 
the life of their own communities sufficiently, and are failing to prepare their 
students adequately to put into practice the theories they are given, by which 
to insure improvement in the lives of the people among whom they dwell. 
Be it Resolved, That each college concentrate on the improvement of its 
own community and its State, using the following means: 
1. Regular Extension Work: Colleges have long had experts to work 
outside the colleges, but their efforts have not been sufficiently organized; 
the soil has not been prepared for the reception of their messages, and the 
co-operation of the communities has not been adequately enlisted. It is 
suggested that each extension worker organize the county into permanent 
clubs with a definite purpose, definite time of meeting, definite programs, 
that the greater part of the time of these clubs is to be spent in applying theory 
rather than in discussing it, that the expert keep in constant touch with each 
club and receive and publish reports of its work. 
2. Extension Work of Each Resident Member of the Faculty: Every college 
faculty should analyze the needs of its community, and the meeting of those 
needs should be undertaken as a part of their college work by the depart- 
ments most able to meet them. 
It might be well to take one section of the community at the time, the one 
most in need, and concentrate on that. If the homes need physical improve- 
ments; if the food needs to be better prepared; if the sanitary conditions 
are bad, improvements in these lines might be undertaken by the home 
science and hygiene departments. If the gardens and farms are poor and the~ 
yards unattractive, there is work for the agricultural and floriculture depart- 
ments. If working conditions are bad and hours unjust, the sociology and 
economic departments might render assistance. If there are literary, or 
musical, or art clubs needed, programs should be furnished by the college and 
the respective departments of the college should direct these. If the commun- 
ity wants suggestions about anything—from how to plan a social party to 
how to rear its children—the college should be ready to help. 
All this work should be done largely by the students under direction of the 
faculty, for the immediate vicinity should be the laboratory in which the 
students are to get training which they are to apply in their own communities. 
Of course, this work requires the utmost tact. Faculty members have to 
visit socially first the people whom they want to help, and thus break down
-P-A-G-E-297
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 293 
the barriers that exist between people in some districts of the community 
and college people. They must drop into the homes of these neighbors, per- 
haps with a flower for the sick, or a book for the children; they must invite 
and escort them to college entertainments, get them to lose their fear of a 
college campus and feel that it is their own, that the college is one place at 
which they will always be welcome. Not until after this preliminary work, 
resulting in sympathetic contact between college people and the people of 
the community, in confidence in the college and love of it, can any definite 
work in the community be accomplished. 
It is suggested that improvement in only one line at a time be attempted, 
and that the work be so tactfully, so sympathetically done, that the commun- 
ity is kept as unconscious as possible that it is being instructed. One wedge 
by which college people can get into the hearts of the needy of the community 
is by work in the churches of those who most need help. All clubs in the weaker 
part of the community should have college guidance. 
3. Evening Schools and Vacation: Schools and Short Courses: After the 
needs of the community are analyzed and the preliminary work of establish- 
ing bonds of sympathy between the college and the people has been done, 
the college should offer evening courses especially adapted to meet these 
needs—courses not only for the young, but especially for the parents of the 
community. Vacation schools and short courses during the session should 
be especially designed to meet these needs. These schools should be taught 
by both faculty members and students. Students could be given college 
credit for such teaching. These schools are intended not only to meet the 
practical and economic needs of the community, but also the aesthetic, 
the literary, the recreative, and so forth. The idea here is to make the school 
a social centre of the community for both work and pleasure. 
4. Associations Needed by the Community: As an example; the economic 
department should organize and direct a co-operative and marketing associa- 
tion, with headquarters at the college, for the produce of the community. 
This would bring the people into the college grounds and give them con- 
fidence in the leadership of the college. If the college sees need of any other 
association, it should organize and conduct it. 
The accomplishment of this union of community and college is entirely 
dependent on the attitude of the college faculty. If they identify themselves 
with the people who need them most not in theory, but in fact, if they cease 
to maintain a “holier than thou” attitude and can really feel one with the 
people, if they genuinely love them, if they can be with them and give them 
sympathy in their joys and in their sorrows, kindly yet expert assistance in 
their struggles, if they can give them the hand of a sister’or brother, then they 
will succeed. Without this genuine, this necessary attitude, all effort will 
be in vain, and will antagonize the community rather than bind it to the 
college. 
If the college does not identify itself with its community and with its 
State, if it does not take immediate means of giving assistance in all lines to 
its people, if it does not accomplish genuine leadership, and that quickly, 
if it does not recognize and adjust itself to the democratic spirit of the age, 
revenues will be withdrawn, other agencies will fulfil the mission of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  294 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
college and its great opportunity will be gone perhaps forever. Never has 
the college had such possibility for power as it has today. The college must 
create something beyond itself. Like man, it is a “bridge not a goal,” a 
bridge to a better college and to a better life. 
WHAT THE COLLEGE CAN DO FOR THE COMMUNITY. 
President Wm. Goodell Frost, Berea, Ky. 
Mrs. Frost and I were once entertained in a mountain cabin on the waters 
of Cutshin Creek. The woman of the house was without education, but one 
who had been through the discipline of life and reflected upon its experiences 
until she was truly wise. She gave us this sketch of a young college student, 
who, for that summer was teaching the public school of Cutshin. ‘He is 
clever enough, and he knows enough, but he sorter keeps to hisself. And 
when he ain’t a teachin’, he is a readin’ books. But you see a teacher’s got 
to be a talkin’ and a mixin’, if he does folks good, leastways, ignorant folks 
like us!”” 
This may give us a fair example of the general aloofness of culture. The 
same thing is illustrated in a recent anecdote by James Bryce. He tells of 
his call when a mere undergraduate upon the great Professor Goldwin Smith. 
The professor meant to be cordial, but he sat in silence or discoursed on things 
which were upon his, the professor’s mind. If the professor could not find 
a point of contact in the case of a student of the calibre of James Bryce, we 
can easily estimate how vast was the aloofness between him and his ordinary 
pupils. And when an institution does not reach in’an intimate way its own 
pupils, how can it mold the community? 
It was to overcome this aloofness of the scholarly world that the great 
universities of England a few years ago established an extension service, and 
thus introduced a new word to the vocabulary of education. 
In introducing this important topic, I shall simply make five affirmations. 
First, it is the duty of an institution of learning to know the community 
about it. This is one of the elementary postulates of pedagogics. The teacher 
must know his pupil. The institution of learning is a neighbor, and it is the 
powerful and the “high-toned”’ neighbor which is called upon to make advances 
towards those who are less powerful and less reputable. 
Here, too, grave and respectable institutions of learning have started a good 
practice and consecrated it with an academic name. We hear of the “social 
survey.”’ But a social survey is nothing but stacks of figures until we have 
an intimacy with individuals. Wm. E. Gladstone was a man of imagination 
and sympathy, but he felt that it was necessary, if he were to feel the truth 
of statistics and think wisely for the millions, that he should have contact with 
the individuals as regularly as he took his meals or engaged in private devo- 
tion. He made it his custom each week to read the Bible in some humble 
home.
-P-A-G-E-299
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 295 
In the second place, it is the duty of an institution of learning to hold out 
an attainable ideal for every human being. 
Too often the only attitude of the educated is expressed in the curt verdict 
“let the bright boy go to college, the others don’t matter.» This cannot be 
a patriotic or Christian attitude. It must be that the great Father has an 
attainable ideal of blessedness for each child of His. And we who are intel- 
lectually privileged have no higher duty than to help each soul towards 
the realization of this divine plan. Only today I have been conversing with 
a university graduate who mentioned incidentally how his distinguished 
professor had spoken of the minister of the gospel and the teacher as being 
able to work for a small salary, because they have “a psychic reward.” I 
am sure a moment’s reflection will convince us that every human being in 
the sphere and calling in which God places him ought to have a psychic reward. 
The institution of higher learning which sets ideal for the community must 
have an ideal, an attainable goal, to set before those who are not to be college 
men and women. 
In the third place, it is the duty of an institution of higher learning to co- 
tribute to the material welfare of the world about it. The material is indeed 
only the pedestal for the spiritual, but such a pedestal is absolutely neces- 
sary. Where does Christ, our Lord, exhibit more of that spirit which bears 
his name than when he multiplies the loaves? The crowds had thronged upon 
him, doubtless somewhat multitudinous, uncultured, disagreeable crowds, 
at last grew hungry and ill-natured. And his disciples feared a tumult, and 
they came with anxious forebodings: ‘Master, send the multitudes away, 
that they may go to the villages and buy bread.” Jesus said, “Make them to 
sit down; give ye them to eat.’ 
Now a large number of the sciences cultivated by the great universities 
ought to minister truly to common life—mathematics, chemistry, biology, 
economics, etc. All these should shed their light not for capital only, but for 
every humble earner of bread. 
And in the fourth place, it is the duty of the college to contribute to the 
higher life of its humble neighbors. It is to provide not only intellectual 
and spiritual satisfaction for those who are educated, but for those who are 
not. They, too, have a claim to the promise, ‘Man shall not live by bread 
alone.”’ Here, again, is the mistake of many good people. We have tried 
to turn all the world into college graduates, and have despised, disparaged, 
or withheld the aesthetic and moral rewards which should be in the reach 
of others. 
Many of you remember the name of Eugene V. Debs. That name had a 
brief newspaper notoriety, when its possessor in his obscure room in Chicago, 
for some days held up the railroad traffic of the United States. It was my 
privilege to hear Mr. Debs expound his theory. He said: ‘Other labor 
agitators have endeavored to help laboring men get out of labor and climb 
into the leisure of the soft-handed class. My aim is not to make laboring 
men desert their labor, but to elevate the entire laboring class—to give them 
culture in their vocations.” That is a wonderful program. 
And it is not incongruous to the best affirmation of educational science. 
Culture is a growth and not a finished thing. ‘Boston is a state of mind,” 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
    296 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
and we believe that in vocations people can experience growth and enjoy 
that state of mind which is culture. 
The great weakness in all the efforts of the privileged to help the un- 
privileged, after. we have divested ourselves of the condescending spirit, is 
to realize the importance of the humble first steps. The majority of our teachers 
shoot over the heads of their pupils, and do not take account of the importance 
of the first steps. 
These four attitudes must precede all special plans and devices for bringing 
the college into useful touch with the community. 
And I have one further affirmation: The college that assumes these atti- 
tudes will have its reward. Its own teaching will be vastly improved, and it 
will find appreciation from the world about it. 
A few years ago, Mrs. Frost made a trip from one county seat in the moun- 
tains to another. The mail-carrier with whom she rode was an interesting 
and interested man, and asked many questions about northern and eastern 
States which she had visited. When his first curiosity was somewhat slaked 
he lapsed into reflection and exclaimed: ‘‘That’s a heap of things going on 
up thar that we don’t know nary thing about.” And then native pride exerted 
itself, “‘An’ I allow thet thar’s a heap of things a going on down here that they 
all don’t know nary thing about.” And then came the great philosophical 
reflection, ‘and mixin’ larns both parties.” 
This, my friends, is a part of the higher wisdom. Jesus said, ““‘When thou 
makest a feast, thou shalt not call the rich lest they reward thee, but thou 
shalt call the poor, the blind and the maimed, and thou shalt be blessed.”

The meeting was called to order by President Adam Phillips, of Concord, 
Tenn. 
In the absence of the secretaries of the departments of elementary and sec- 
ondary education, R. Y. Maxey, Superintendent of City Schools, Elizabeth- 
town, Ky., was elected secretary. 
The report of the committee on the better articulation of the elementary 
and secondary schools was presented by Dr. J. W. Fertig, Murfreesboro, 
Tenn., as follows: 
This committee was appointed in January in accordance with a resolution 
adopted at the Nashville meeting. The committee supposed that it would 
have approximately a year in which to formulate a plan, make a preliminary 
investigation and prepare a report. A month later, however, the committee 
was informed that a report of some sort would be expected from it at this 
meeting, barely two months from date of notice. The committee is now en- 
deavoring to meet that expectation, although what it has to offer is not a
-P-A-G-E-302
  298 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
report of an investigation, but merely a statement, which may prove to be 
only preliminary to a preliminary report. In the opinion of the committee, 
the subject is worthy of further investigation and a more elaborate report, 
and we respectfully ask that the committee be continued another year and 
that a small appropriation be made to meet the expense of the necessary cor- 
respondence. 
The adoption of the resolution providing for the appointment of this com- 
mittee is in itself evidence of a feeling of a need of a better articulation of the 
parts of the public school system. Indeed, it is a well-known fact that the 
change from the elementary school to the high school is so abrupt that it, 
in many cases, amounts to a barrier well-nigh impassable. The pupils of the 
eighth grade are treated much like the pupils of the lower grades and are 
taught in the same manner. After the lapse of a summer vacation they are 
sent to another building, in a remote part of the town perhaps, with new 
associates, are given entirely new subjects of study, are put in definite charge 
of no one, are taught by several teachers, all new, and are required to prepare 
and recite lessons of twice the former length and many times the former dif- 
ficultness. In short, they are expected to change over summer from children 
to men and women. The effect of all this is the absence of everything like 
articulation, an unbridged chasm at whose brink most pupils stop, and many 
of those who attempt to cross, fail to do so. 
The cure for this condition is what this committee is asked to ascertain 
and report upon. It is the opinion of the committee that the cure is to be 
found in a study of the history of our school system. When the public schools 
took over the work of secondary instruction, a sufficient number of grades 
were added to fill up the gap between the elementary school and the college. 
These upper grades the college very naturally came to dominate through its 
demands on those seeking entrance into college. As the college has raised 
its entrance requirements, the amount of work that must be done in the high 
school has increased. This increase has, in many instances, amounted to a 
full year’s work. At the same time the weight of the elementary course has 
been increased by the admission of many new subjects of study. With the 
college constantly pulllng the high school upward, and the elementary 
school constantly getting heavier because of the new additions, the breach 
between the two has continually widened, until it has reached the condition 
described above—a gulf which few try to cross and fewer succeed. It is the 
opinion of the committee that the cure for this condition is to be found only 
in a complete overhauling of the public school system from the botton up- 
ward, and in making radical changes both in the organization and in the course 
of study. The breach must be filled and obliterated, not merely bridged. 
As a basis for a preliminary discussion the committee proposes the follow- 
ing analysis and questionaire: 
I. Present Condition: The appointment of this committee is sufficient 
evidence of a need of a better articulation of the parts of our public 
school system. Indeed there is a lack of articulation, the breach be- 
tween the parts having widened until it resembles a broad unbridged 
chasm which few cross successfully.

  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 299 
II. The Cause: The break is the natural result of the increased weight. of 
the elementary school through the addition of many new subjects and 
of the raising of the high school through the increase in college en- 
trance requirements. 
III. The Cure: The committee is of the opinion that the cure is to be found 
in a more exact definition of the task of the elementary school and of 
the high school; in certain well-marked changes in the organization 
of the system; and in a complete re-organization of the course of 
study beginning at the bottom. 
The committee proposes the following outline and questionaire for 
discussion and criticism: 
1. Definition of such terms as elementary school and high school. 
(a) What is the task of the elementary school and how much 
time is required for its performance? 
(b) What is the task of the high school? 
(c) Can a grade be defined in terms of time and content? 
2. Desirable changes in the present organization. 
i. In the elementary school 
(a) An eight-year course with departmental 
teaching and promotion by subject in the 
upper grades. 
(b) A six-year elementary course. 
ii. In the high school 
(a) Four-year course with the lower year so modi- 
fied as to articulate perfectly with the 
present eighth grade. 
(b) Six-year continuous course with unified organ- 
ization. 
(c) Six-year course with junior and senior divi- 
sions. 
iii. Questions suggested by the above analysis for which 
answers are sought. 
(a) What is the task of the elementary school? Of 
the high school? What is and what should 
be the nature of the transition from one to 
the other? Will departmental teaching in 
the grades above the sixth, sufficiently 
bridge the gap? 
(b) Will six years be sufficient time for the elemen- 
tary school to complete its task? 
(c) How would the six-and-six division help in 
curing the congestion in the curriculum? 
In increasing the attendance and in doing 
better work in the high school? 
(ad) What advantages does the junior high school 
idea offer in modifying the curriculum and 
class organization to better suit the needs 
of adolescents?  
-P-A-G-E-304
  300 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
3. Desirable changes in the course of study. 
(a) What shall be eliminated? 
(b) What shall be added to the present course? 
(c) Will the proposed re-organization facilitate these modi- 
fications? 
4, Changes in the school laws made necessary by the above changes. 
(a) Regarding the branches taught in the high school. 
(b) Regarding the administration and expenditure of funds. 
(c) Regarding the certification of teachers. 
5. What advantages may be expected from the above changes? 
(a) Increase in the number who go through the high school. 
(b) Departmental teaching in the upper grades would 
become a necessity. 
(c) Increase of the amount of work done by ten per cent. 
or more. 
(d) Both elementary and high school would be made more 
efficient by having their work better defined. 
Following the submitting of the analysis and’ questionaire by Dr. J. W. 
Fertig, discussion was entered into by several others. 
It was interesting to note the emphasis put on the organization of work so 
that both the elementary and secondary school courses could be finished 
in eleven years. The eight and four, seven and four, five, three and three 
plans were discussed. : 
The Committee on Better Articulation of the Elementary and Secondary 
Schools was continued to make further investigation as to plans of articulation 
in various States and report at the next meeting of the departments. 
On motion, officers of both departments were re-elected. 
Adjournment.

SOME EXPERIMENTS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN A MILL 
COMMUNITY. 
R. B. Daniel, Columbus, Ga. 
In many of our recent educational gatherings the problem of rural educa- 
tion has been given a conspicuous place on the program, and is thought by 
some to be the most difficult of solution of all the problems that command 
the educational thought. If this is true it is only so because of the numbers 
involved. If it is true at all it is because of the quantity and not because of 
the difficulties that attend its proper solution. 
The most trying problem educationally, in my judgment, is the proper 
education of the children of mill operatives. Unlike the children of the rural 
districts, they are not diffused over a large area, but are segregated for the 
most part, in mill villages and communities. These children live in homes 
that are usually uncomely, uncomfortable and unsanitary. Wanting in the 
pride of ownership, little is done in the average mill settlement to better con- 
ditions in any particular. 
Often these children spring from parents who have been unskilled laborers 
in mills for several generations. Their immediate parents have lost hope 
in its broadest sense. Their earthly possessions consist for the most part, in the 
clothes they wear and some furniture that they are paying for on the install- 
ment plan. Usually they are a transient people—here today, somewhere 
else tomorrow. They have nothing to leave, so they move upon the slightest 
provocation. Often they are encouraged in this by mills that happen to be 
short of labor in other places offering to pay their transportation. 
The home life of these children is often poor. The parents, their natural 
guardians and protectors, leave home for the mills at an early hour in the 
morning and return late in the evening. If any adult remains in the home 
during the day, it is one who is not qualified to do a day’s work in the mills 
either from advanced age or the ravages of disease. In either event they make 
poor companions and guides for the young. Coming from such homes and 
such parents, the offsprings are frequently physically defective, which, of 
course, is destructive to ambition and hinders the advancement of the children 
in school. 
The mill owners and operators are not always wholly to blame for the con- 
dition of these people. They seem to be the victims of conditions over which 
no one class of people exercises complete control. The mills that I know 
generally pay fair wages, and are fairly considerate of the welfare of their 
operatives. But the operatives themselves seem to have little desire to save 
and establish normal homes of their own. 
You will see, therefore, the difficulties that attend all efforts to educate 
these children. Since they have attended school very little in the Southern 
States, where there are no compulsory attendance laws, all education that is 
offered must necessarily be elementary at first, whether it is industriad or 
academic. At present these children neither have the inclination nor the 
preparation to pursue courses in secondary schools. Hitherto so soon as the    
 
-P-A-G-E-307
PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 303 
law allowed them to be employed in the mills they have left school to go to 
work. 
The environment of these children being unusual, the type of education 
offered them must also be unusual. The courses of study, the hours, and 
school activities generally, must differ very materially at first from those 
of the standardized school. In other words, standard children only should 
attend standard schools. And if the standard school is the ideal, then these 
children must be brought through a series of evolutions to appreciate and profit 
by what is good for the ordinary child of the ordinary American community. 
Some twelve years ago the board of trustees of the Columbus, Ga., public 
schools, acting upon the suggestions of Mr. C. B. Gibson, then superintendent 
of schools, undertook to establish and maintain a primary industrial school 
in the midst of a mill district where there were some 500 mill children in easy 
reach of it. A handsome old colonial home, which had been abandoned because 
of the coming of the mills, was purchased and converted into a school for 
the children and a home for the teachers, who were to direct the activities 
of the children of this community in school and so far as possible, out of 
school. It was also in the mind of the superintendent and the board in having 
teachers live in the community in which the school was located, to be in close 
touch with the adults or parents of the children whom they expected to teach. 
The grounds on which this building is located are large and ample for the 
purpose needed. Generally speaking, the work to be undertaken was to be 
educational and social, the latter mainly as it affected the former. Only a 
small per cent. of the children of this community had ever attended any 
school, and those who had, had done so only for a brief time. Therefore 
only elemeritary courses were offered. Besides the academic work, the girls 
were required to take courses in elementary hand work, basketry, cooking 
and sewing. The boys were required to take, besides the academic work, 
elementary courses in hand work, wood-shop work, and gardening. Of 
the five and one-half hours per day that they are actually in session, four are 
devoted to the usual academic subjects, while one and one-half (the last 
in the afternoon) is devoted to industrial work of some character. An hour 
and one-half per day of industrial work is the minimum requirement. As 
a matter of fact, the pupils often remain after schools hours to work in the 
garden or to complete some piece of woodwork in the shop in which they are 
especially interested. 
The academic courses in this school are similar to the courses offered in the 
others schools of the system, except in its severer adherence to the “three 
R’s.”’ Knowing that the time is very limited in which these children will 
attend school, more attention is given to what may be regarded as the funda- 
mentals. While the prescribed course contemplates seven years, few continue 
after the fifth or sixth year, so strong is the call of the mills. 
The industrial work was intended to be practical and to have a practical 
value. It was not intended to be vocational, but was expected to influence 
conditions in the homes represented. A vocational school of high school 
rank has been established, and it was thought perhaps that the children of 
this mill school would go on to the vocational school, but in this respect we 
have been disappointed. We hope, however, that the time is coming when
-P-A-G-E-308
  304 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
the connection between the work of this school and our industrial high school 
will be established and that boys and girls, too, will pass from the one to the 
other in larger numbers than heretofore. 
Returning to the work of the mill school, the boys are allowed to have all 
articles of value that they make in the shop for their homes, and are permitted 
to take vegetables home or to sell them. The girls, upon the payment of 
the cost of the material, make clothes for themselves and other members of 
the family. 
The grounds of this school are equipped with swings, joggling boards, 
basketball standards, swimming pool, etc. In fact, the grounds are used as 
a playground for the children of the community at all times when the school 
is not in session. Frequently children come to the school grounds at six in 
the morning, when their parents go to the mills to work, and remain on the 
grounds until the parents return in the evening. In this way they are better 
protected than they would be either upon the streets or in their homes. 
Especially for boys above school age, a complete gymnasium equipment 
has been installed in a separate building on the grounds. This was the gift 
of a Sunday school class of one of the leading churches of the city, and through 
the generosity of other friends of the school a physical director goes out twice 
a week in the evenings and supervises the work of the classes in the gymna- 
sium. At first everything was free, but now an organization has been formed 
and those who participate in the use of the equipment pay a small fee to the 
association, which also helps to pay the physical director. The pupils of the 
school use the gymnasium during the day, usually after school hours. 
One of the local women’s clubs has established a library in the school and 
contributes to it annually a number of new books, and the young people and 
others are invited in the evenings to the library rooms to read, play games, 
etc., under the direction of the teachers. 
Teachers visit in the neighborhood homes daily. In this way they know 
conditions and advise the people especially about matters pertaining to health 
and sanitation. The teachers frequently gather up pupils on Saturday and 
take them to a free clinic for treatment or for operations. 
The school is quite a social centre, especially on holiday occasions. The 
Christmas tree is an annual event. Many kindly disposed people donate 
presents of money to purchase gifts for the children of the community, and 
parents meet the teachers in the evenings at the school and make all needed 
preparation for this important annual affair. 
This school opens in the morning at 8 o’clock and closes at 11 for the noon 
recess. They begin the afternoon session at 1 and close at 3:30. The long 
recess in the middle of the day is allowed because the great majority of the 
children who attend this school take dinner to the mills for mothers and” 
fathers, brothers and sisters, or some other inmate of the homes. On account 
of this fact, the children frequently call themselves ‘‘dinner toters,”’ and their 
school the “dinner toters’ school.” 
We have briefly given an outline of the work that has been carried on in 
this community for the past twelve years for mill children. Now, you are 
not so much concerned about what was actually done, but the results of it. 
Of course, it is difficult under any circumstances, to measure educational
-P-A-G-E-309
PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 305 
results. We do know, however, that the attendance of this immediate school 
has grown from an enrollment of about seventy-five to 350 per annum, and 
the actual attendance from about 40 to 175. This variation in enrollment 
and attendance is due to the fickleness and transientness of the people. Be- 
sides the pupils who attend this school, more than 100 have asked for transfers 
to the nearest traditional standard grammar schools. We feel that this was 
a direct result of the work of the mill school. That the work was so inspiring 
that these children became so self-respecting that they wished to be placed 
in the regular graded school, that they might be regularly graded and promoted 
from year to year, and eventually enter the industrial high school. 
The board has been so impressed with this idea that they are building now 
on a lot adjacent to the present plant, a modern eight-room grammar school 
building where the academic work can be done to better advantage than in 
the rooms in a dwelling house changed into school rooms. We propose to 
give these people the best grammar school building in the system, having all 
the modern features that we regard as meritorious. The plan will be to bring 
back the hundred children that have been transferred to standard grammar 
schools and require them to attend school in their own district. Then we will 
classify all of the normal children that are now attending the mill school and 
establish regular graded academic work. We will maintain in this building a 
room of subnormals to be taught by a teacher who is especially skilled in hand- 
ling children of this character. It is the purpose of the board to maintain all 
the best features of what we have previously done, but to standardize espec- 
ially the academic work and make these people feel that they are not different 
from others; and in this way we hope to increase their self respect. 
Visible results may also be seen in the general appearance of the children 
who attend the school. They are unquestionably better dressed and more 
cleanly than they were formerly, and the homes show also some improvement 
along the same line. A few of the pupils of this school, after going through 
five or six grades, have chosen to go into other lines of work rather than mill 
work, and have been successful. These, however, are the exception. By far 
the larger per cent. remain mill operatives and it is no desire of ours particu- 
larly to change them to other vocations, for we realize that theirs is a legitimate 
work that must be done. But we do sincerely hope to lead them by degrees 
to higher standards of living. Of course we will be handicapped in this work 
until we have better labor laws and a compulsory attendance law. Until 
that good day comes, we must content ourselves with rather slow processes 
and meagre progress. Surely the six Southern States that have not yet made 
provision to give their children a fair chance will not delay much longer in 
placing upon the statute books such laws as would cause to be removed from 
us the finger of scorn because of our long hesitation in giving to the children 
of this section what has long been provided for them in other parts of our com- 
mon country.

STATEMENT OF EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN SOUTHERN 
COTTON MILL COMMUNITIES. 
J. A. Baldwin, Charlotte, N. C. 
There are in the South approximately 500,000 people in about 800 cotton 
mill communities. In the two Carolinas the numbers are just about equal. 
Georgia and Alabama follow with large but considerably smaller numbers, 
several other Southern States being represented with very much smaller 
numbers. These mills have nearly all been built during the last thirty years 
and a large proportion of them during the last fifteen years, so the problems 
presented are comparatively new, or they come to us in new form. This 
latter fact is one that has furnished occasion for much discussion and dis- 
agreement. All agree that conditions are far from what they should be, but 
there is considerable difference of opinion as to placing the responsibility. 
In the discussion of the subject a number of questions naturally come up and 
the answer agreed upon for one will determine to a considerable extent the 
method of approach to another. Questions that naturally occur to us are: 
Have the conditions of the people been made better or worse by their mill 
life? Up to this time have the efforts that have been put forth in their behalf 
been what might reasonably have been expected of those in places of respon- 
sibility? Are we now doing what we should? And if not, what else may be 
reasonably undertaken? The limits of this paper, of course, will not permit 
a discussion of all these questions, but in order to get the subject before us, 
it is desirable that some explanations should be made. A serious mistake, 
and one very often made, is that the mill people are all pretty much the same. 
That is a mistake so far as character and forcefulness are concerned—as 
serious as to think that all the farmers, or merchants, or manufacturers are 
the same. It is true, on the other hand, that their condition is much more 
nearly alike than that of other classes mentioned. They are all poor and un- 
educated, or comparatively so, or they would not be at the mill. Practically 
all of them come from farms, and they left the farms and went to the mill 
because they did not succeed very well on the farm. There is no way of 
telling exactly just what proportion of these people came from the mountains. 
from the hill country, or from the low country. Nor is there any exact in- 
formation as to the number who owned their own homes and those who were 
renters. I think it may be said in a general way that the finest mill people are 
those from the hill country who owned their own homes, and next to them the 
home owners from the mountains, and next in order the tenants from the low 
country. Not a few of the mill people are descended from the best blood of 
the country and were forced to go to the mill because of some sort of unfor- 
tunate conditions, and are now more or less closely connected with the most 
prominent men in the country. I have known personally during the last 
fifteen years hundreds of mill people, who are closely related to the most 
prominent people in all walks of life. I know two women in a mill com- 
munity who are first cousins of a man who will easily rank as one of the ten 
greatest living preachers. These women and their children show clear in- 
dications of the good bloed that flows through their veins. On the other
-P-A-G-E-311
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 307 
extreme we find the laziest and most shiftless of all our white population in our 
mills. Some of these people are unquestionably descended from the worst 
and poorest element of the population brought over in the early days. It 
will not do, however, to stress the matter of heredity too far, for many of whom 
better things might reasonably have been expected have undoubtedly failed 
to improve, but have retrograded, while many of the poorest have made most 
surprising progress when the opportunity has been furnished them. The 
greatest movement to the mills was made at a time of great stagnation in 
agricultural life, especially during the period when cotton was selling from 
four cents to seven cents per pound. That their material conditions have 
improved there can be no question. They have a much better quality of food 
than they had formerly. They wear much better clothes; they travel a good 
deal more (unfortunately, when they travel, they too often take everything 
they have with them). They are, I suppose, the greatest movers on record. 
I knew one case where a man moved thirteen times in one year; an average 
of once a year for a number of years is a very ordinary record. This effect 
of certain unfortunate conditions is the cause of many others. But the one 
good thing about it is that it enables them to see a good deal more of the world. 
In the matter of education there is no question but that the children are 
having much better advantages than their parents had. Whether they are 
having better opportunities than the children of others similarly situated who 
remained on the farm, is another question. My own opinion is that in the 
better mill communities the mill children have much better advantages than 
those who were left on the farm, while in the poor mill communities the chil- 
dren are not so favorably situated as those on the farm. It may be well to 
note here that in probably no other occupation is there so much difference 
between communities as is to be found in the different mill communities. 
There are mill communities where the conditions are well-nigh ideal in many 
important respects. There are others in which the conditions are unspeakably 
bad. This is made possible because, as a general rule, the company owns the 
house in which the people life, and the nature of the work is very similar, 
and it is easy to move from one place to another; the best people naturally 
go together, and the worst naturally go together. For this reason, it is par- 
ticularly important to make due allowance for the statements of people who 
have had but a limited opportunity to judge the mill conditions of the whole 
country. Some have seen certain conditions and they are enthusiastic be- 
cause of their excellence; others have seen the worst conditions and are in- 
clined to feel that certainly nothing could be worse. Another fact must be 
taken into consideration in order to get this question properly before us, 
namely, that these people went at a single move from the simplicity of eigh- 
teenth century life into the complex industrial conditions of the twentieth 
century life. They had to learn for the first time, how to be close neighbors 
with large numbers of people, how to co-operate in big industrial establish- 
ments, how to attend to the handling and spending of greatly increased 
amounts of money, and the many duties outspringing from these. Perhaps 
the finest trait of character of these people has been the one that has given 
more trouble than anything else, namely, their positive individuality. There 
is no thoughtful man but looks with some feeling of real concern at the mul- 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
    308 " SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
titudes of men and women in our cities when he considers that almost every- 
body is trying to be like everybody else. Those coming from isolated country 
sections may be accused of a good many things, but that is not one of them. 
On the other hand, their individuality is so marked that it is often exceedingly 
trying to them to co-operate in a way that is absolutely necessary if the largest 
results are to be obtained, and often rather than yield a comparatively in- 
significant point they will move. 
For some years there were no child-labor laws, and children as young as 
eight, and in some few cases even younger, worked in the mill and it was not 
uncommon for children from ten to twelve to work. During that period 
many children did not get an opportunity to go to school. It must be remem- 
bered, too, that during that period the usual terms of the country schools 
were two to three months, and comparatively few of the smaller children 
from the poorer families went even those short terms. Now I believe all the 
States have laws keeping children out of the mill from twelve to fourteen years 
of age, and very mild compulsory education laws have been passed on some 
of the States, while some still have none at all. The States in most cases, 
have provided schools for a period of from three to five months during the 
year. In most cases the State fund has been supplemented by the mill com- 
pany, so as to have schools running from six to ten months during the year. 
Some few communities have had well-equipped schoolhouses and well-trained 
teachers. These have done satisfactory work. In other communities the 
schoolhouses have been poor, the teachers young and poorly trained, and the 
rooms are badly overcrowded. Slowly, but gradually, and surely, these con- 
ditions are being improved. Many mill managers are doing everything that 
can reasonably be expected of them, and often at a sacrifice little dreamed 
of by the operatives or by the public at large. There are others who have 
shown very great indifference in the matter, seeming to feel their obligation 
ended when they paid the people as little as it was possible to secure their 
services for. Here, again, one is sometimes tempted to be over-enthusiastic 
in praising managers when he comes in touch with some individual and knows 
what good he is doing and under what conditions; on the other hand if he 
sees the worst side he is tempted to say things that would be altogether unjust 
to a large number of earnest, honest men who are struggling in every way they 
know to do their duty. 
The important question with us is, What can we do to-day to improve the 
conditions? First of all, I should say continue along the lines we have been 
working for a good many years to improve the public school. It is not nec- 
essary in this meeting even to indicate the influences that are bringing about. 
greater improvements in the way of better school buildings, better teachers 
and longer terms. Suffice it to say that the improvements noted in every 
section of our country are not a whit less in mill communities than elsewhere, 
and not a few of them are proving models for the surrounding country. 
Of course, every child should have a knowledge of reading, writing and 
arithmetic. These are the tools without which it is almost impossible to de- 
velop efficient workers or good citizens. For those who desire advancement 
in the mill, arithmetic is particularly important. In this connection I think 
I should digress long enough to mention another fact. Aside from the work
-P-A-G-E-313
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES ° 309 
done in the schoolhouse, there has been a tremendous amount of training 
given of which the world at large knows little, but which is exceedingly im- 
portant. Those who have not had occasion to look into the matter can 
scarcely realize what our mill managers have actually done in the way of 
taking the raw, untrained workers from the country and teaching them the 
cotton mill business. When we consider the fact that a great many overseers 
and not a few superintendents, had not a sufficient knowledge of arithmetic 
to make the simplest calculations in fractions, and in some cases did not even 
understand multiplication and long division, we can understand something 
of the task that our mill managers had had in developing these men into 
competent industrial leaders. I am inclined to emphasize this because often 
there looms up so large before us the things that need to be done that we do 
not give anything like adequate consideration to these big things that have 
actually been accomplished. 
How much education ought mill people to have? Owing to the nature of 
the work, book learning is not necessary in order that good spinning and 
weaving be done, but it is almost invariably true of mill overseers, superin- 
tendents and managers that prefer workers with some education—they 
understand directions better, they are more ambitious, their minds work more 
clearly and their hands more quickly as a rule, and, as a rule, they are also 
more reliable. On the other hand, it must be frankly confessed by those who 
advocate larger educational advantages, that a very large proportion of the 
people who are working in the mills of the better classes, those who are 
anxious for more education and those who are capable of taking it are anxious 
to get more education to enable them to quit the mill and do something else. 
If a mill manager takes a narrow view of it he could very readily and quickly 
say, ‘No, I don’t care to educate people so they will leave my work and be- 
come clerks, street-car conductors and motormen, barbers, railroad men, or 
even to become physicians, teachers, preachers, stenographers and trained 
nurses. One man, taking a broader view of it says freely it is purely business 
reasons that prompt him to make his mill the best possible, because the time 
is coming when the foreigners are going to come in and the best communities 
will have native help and poorer communities will have to take the foreign 
help. Of course, the broadest view is that everyone should be encouraged 
and helped to find the place where he can live the greatest life possible for 
him, and at the same time render the largest possible service to humanity. 
It will be interesting to note here that in America cotton mill work has for 
about 100 years now been a continual stepping stone to other occupations. 
In New England there has been a succession of workers from the native New 
Englander to the English, Scotch, and Irish, to the French Canadians and on 
up to a comparatively recent period, when the flood gates of Europe have 
been raised and all kinds and conditions of people have poured in. The 
Americans, English and Scotch were pushed out and up into all sorts of good 
positions. The Irish have largely become the policemen and aldermen of 
our bigger cities as well as filling other important positions. The French 
Canadians are filling positions of increasing responsibility. The assimila- 
tion of the present mass of foreigners is a colossal task. One man in New 
England told me that within a mile of his church there were twenty languages

spoken. To complicate the situation up there the owners are English Protes- 
tants and the operatives are almost altogether foreign Catholics, and co- 
operation along the line of religious and welfare work is exceedingly difficult, 
if not impossible. Here in the South we are all of the same blood, we all speak 
the same language, we all have the same religion, and the only hindrance 
to the accomplishment of worthy objects is the lack of money and trained 
workers on the one side, and the indifference and carelessness of the people 
themselves on the other, There is practically no opposition. 
Among additional things that I think can and should be done are first, 
larger apportionment and better arrangements for night schools. There are 
a great many people in the mill communities from fifteen to thirty years 
of age who would avail themselves of going to night schools, and are exceed- 
ingly anxious for the opportunity. Much good has resulted from spasmodic 
efforts here and there of some few earnest people in this work. I think the 
time has come when our State board of education should make provision for 
greatly enlarged work in this line. In these schools particular attention should 
be given to arithmetic. There is a crying need for teachers who can make 
application of a comparatively meagre knowledge of arithmetic to the problems 
of the machinery of the mill. In all ordinary work of the mill the only know- 
ledge of arithmetic necessary is fractions, percentage, proportion and square 
root. The unfortunate thing of it today is that one set of folks know arith- 
metic, another set of folks know the machinery, but comparatively few 
people know both who have the ability and the time to teach it. 
Another important work is home-making. To intimate that a woman 
does not know how to to cook and keep house, is a rather dangerous thing to 
do. Did they not learn from their mothers, and did not their mothers know 
all about it? In this presence I need not say that it is not mill people only who 
have much to learn in matters of this sort. How to prepare food that is agree- 
able to the palate and is at the same time wholesome and is so balanced as to 
be perfectly satisfactory and at reasonable cost, is a task worthy of’ our 
most highly trained women; and a great majority even of our best trained 
women have very limited knowledge of what a balanced ration means, or the 
quantity that a well man, or a sick man, or a child ought to have, and the 
knowledge of its preparation. It is easy to see, too, that in our mill com- 
munities these problems are very much greater than they are where oppor- 
tunities for greater knowledge have been so much more abundant. It is a 
work that has to be done tactfully, but it is a work that certainly ought to be 
done. Domestic science teachers are to be found in quite a number of our 
mill communities in the South, but their number ought to be increased as 
quickly as possible a hundred fold. I will not here undertake to speak of the 
methods they should use. In fact, I don’t know. We must leave it to con- 
secrated women who do know how to do the work earnestly and tactfully, 
but we must make arrangements to secure the women and make the con- 
ditions for their success possible. : 
Third, the development of a larger and better social life. The people 
of the mills, as a rule, do not know how to be sociable, and we cannot blame 
them, because for generations they have lived isolated lives and they cannot 
all at once and of their own initiative change. The young people respond
-P-A-G-E-315
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 3tt 
gladly and willingly whenever the right sort of opportunity is given. This is 
one kind of service to which there comes up no reasonable objection from 
anybody, and I do not know anything except right relationship with God and 
man, and this indeed is a part of that, that will bring so much happiness into 
their lives. Y. M. C. A.’s and Y. W. C. A.’s where established, altogether 
aside from what they are doing in other lines, are doing a work in this field 
alone that I think will justify every cent they cost. 
Fourth, religious work should be encouraged. I would commend most 
heartily the evangelistic spirit that is to be found in our Southern cotton 
mill communities. And I think I can speak on this point with some authority, 
because it is a field in which I have had quite considerable experience, but 
the work is entirely too limited. The intellect is not sufficiently considered, 
there is not enough of instruction, there is too much exhortation. I believe 
that a field of very great opportunity is for our religious leaders to conduct 
Bible institutes in our mill communities and thus secure a more intelligent 
conception of their duties to God and man. 
Fifth, part time work. Is it practicable for children and young people to 
work part time and go to school part time? That a great many people think 
so is indicated by the fact that all over the country in various lines of work 
for a good many years there have been efforts in this direction. As a rule 
mill managers are afraid of it. It does not appeal to them ordinarily as being 
practicable. In England, for more than a generation now, they have been 
letting children work half a day and go to school half a day. The industrial 
classes, both children and their parents, have liked the system, but educational 
and social leaders have not been so well pleased. I think, however, that their 
objections are not because of any fault in the system itself, but because of 
the fact the children are so young, being from ten to thirteen. The feeling 
is that children of that age ought to be kept out of the mill all the time. 
Another thing that tends to discredit the system there is the fact that the 
children have been very poorly cared for in school. One would think that 
under those discouraging conditions it would not work’ at all, but that it has 
actually worked for a generation or more and with satisfaction to the indus- 
trial classes to my mind means quite a good deal. I have tested it out during 
a period of several years in the Southern Industrial Institute, in Charlotte, 
and the results have been such as to make me feel that there are very great 
possibilities in the scheme. At present there is little we can do in this direc- 
tion except to get as many people as possible thinking about it, and wherever 
possible make some experiments in a small way to see if we may not be able 
to secure advantages by this method that it is not possible to secure in an 
other. All work and no play or school is bad for children and yet it is ex- 
ceedingly important that children learn to work at an early age, and that 
for many reasons. Personally, I would rather see a law that would permit 
children, twelve to sixteen, to go to school half time and work half time, 
than one keeping children out altogether until they are fourteen. I realize 
that this would complicate the school situation and would complicate the 
situation in the mill. I believe, however, that it would not bring up any diffi- 
culties that could not be overcome, and I am convinced that it would be quite 
a good deal better for the child. I doubt though, if we are ready for this at  
-P-A-G-E-316
  $92 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
this time, especially where the schools are still very poor. In this connec- 
tion I would like to speak of another thing. We have the finest opportunity 
to be found anywhere to have flower and vegetable gardens in our cotton mill 
communities, but for many years this was very much neglected. In the last 
few years we have seen a very marked change. The finest chrysanthemums 
grown in Charlotte last year, outside of the greenhouses, were grown in the 
yards of cotton mill operatives, and some of the most magnificent roses as 
well. Instead of the ugliness and trash that used to be considered a necessary 
part of the mill community, we now have some communities that are known 
far and wide for their beauty. In the matter of raising vegetables, too, a 
great advance has been made. In the cotton mill community near which I 
live and work in Charlotte, composed of about 120 families, a government 
expert estimated two or three years ago that the vegetables from the gardens 
would amount to from $6,000 to $8,000. This movement is broadening 
year by year, but we should endeavor in every way possible to extend it much 
more rapidly. 
I wonder if I may be permitted, in closing, to come to visions and dreams. 
Thoughtful people have been troubled at the conditions brought about by 
the automatic machinery era in which we live. We cannot but come to a 
serious pause when we remember the great law that we must use our powers 
or lose them. It is also true that we do not do much more than the circum- 
stances under which we are placed or under which we place ourselves compel 
us to do. Now the serious situation confronts us that in many lines of work 
automatic machinery makes it unnecessary for the operatives to think. After 
the process is learned, which may require anywhere from a few minutes to 
a few months, it becomes a matter of practice, of agility. Perhaps in no work 
has automatic machinery been brought to greater perfection than in that 
for the manufacture of cotton goods. The managers and the machines do 
all the hard thinking. The principal job of most workers is to tie threads. 
They do not have to think, and in accordance with life’s great law they do 
not think. The conditions are just the reverse of what they once were, then 
the man who worked on the farm did not need to think, and the man of the 
factory did. Now improved machinery and scientific farming make it nec- 
essary for the farmer to think; and the mill operatives, not including of course, 
the superintendents and overseers, do not have, during the course of a whole 
day, or even year, one difficult question to solve about his work. I would 
not, for a moment, leave the impression that I am anxious to go back to “the 
good old days” of which we occasionally hear. I believe these are the best 
days we have ever seen. Automatic machinery has undoubtedly made life 
much more delightful for all classes of people. But I believe better days are 
yet to be. The inventive genius, or social, and the industrial leadership 
that heretofore have been so signally successful in producing goods, must not 
be content until at the same time they bring about conditions that will also 
produce bigger and stronger men and women. 
Now, provided the people in a mill community could be generally trained 
in trucking, stock-raising, dairying, etc., would it be beyond the bounds of 
reason to suggest this arrangement: Let there be two sets of operatives, 
one to work from 4 A. M. to 12 M., the other to work from 12 M. to 8 P. M. 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES és 303 
The mills once ran thirteen hours a day; then they came to twelve, next to 
eleven, and now to ten. In New England they work only nine. That is, they 
average that much each day for six days. In practice they usually work fewer 
hours Saturday and more other days to make up the full time for the week. 
Now, eight hours, or nine, or even ten, is not long enough for a man to work. 
Successful men seldom work less than twelve, and often fourteen and more 
hours per day. But there is much variety in their work, and it is possible 
for them to work such long hours by reason of their ability to turn from one 
duty to another. Idleness is almost as bad for men as children, and it is a 
risky matter to greatly reduce the hours of labor until the workers are pre- 
pared to employ profitably the leisure. 
The arrangement here suggested would enable each set of operatives to 
get a full night’s sleep, and would give each set a half day of daylight out 
of the mills. It would give those inclined, an opportunity to raise untold 
quantities of truck, in which business not a few are already experts. It would 
give others so inclined, an opportunity to do dairying, several families might 
co-operate in this. Many have special aptitude and ability for this work. 
Others still might raise beef, cattle and hogs, especially those out in country 
mills. If this could be successfully worked, we might reasonably look for the 
time when our cotton mill operatives would also become the truckers and 
dairymen of our Southern cities, and help to make the South one of the 
greatest trucking, canning, dairying and stock-raising sections in the world. 
At the same time, I believe it would make it one of the greatest manufacturing 
sections of the world. For the shorter hours in the mill, together with the 
opportunity for personal initiative, and the satisfaction that would come from 
having a business of their very own under favorable conditions, and the 
thought and planning required to make it a success, and the actual success 
achieved, would produce such favorable conditions that not only would they 
bring satisfaction and content to those now at the mill chafing under present 
conditions, but would attract numbers of other poor people now living a 
very unsatisfactory life on the farm. 
It is perfectly practicable to work the two shifts of operatives. Day and 
night shifts have for a long time run under very objectional conditions and 
succeeded. But the mill managers would be afraid that with such a plan 
they would be expected to pay as much for eight hours as they now pay for 
ten. Of course, that would not be possible. Perhaps no other American 
manufacturers have such fierce competition in the markets of the world as 
do our cotton manufacturers. We must compete with the cheap labor of 
Europe, and now Japan is becoming an active competitor. We have held 
our own in the past and I believe we will continue to do it, but we must re- 
member that the conditions under which they work makes it impossible for 
them to go beyond certain reasonable limits in the payment of labor. 
Is this but a beautiful dream? In my opinion it is practicable, provided 
we can train the children and young people in the principles and practice of 
gardening, dairying and stock-raising. This is not at all an impossible task, 
but one that I think we should undertake as earnestly and as vigorously as 
possible. The South has advantages in this respect to be found in no other 
part of the world. I would say that this could not be brought about by
-P-A-G-E-318
  
  aia. SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
law. At best it could only come gradually. I do believe it is worthy of our 
serious considerations because of the vast possibilities of good involved in it, 
both to the individuals and to the nation. . 
I have not said what I intended, if I have failed to leave the impression 
that we have reason to be gratified at the progress that has been made, nor 
if I have given encouragement to the abandonment of safe and tested work 
for some that are more or less visionary. But I would that we might keep 
free from that complacency that makes us satisfied with conditions until 
we can feel that they are the best that we may reasonably hope for. 
HOME ECONOMICS IN MILL COMMUNITIES. 
Miss Mary E. Frayser, Rock Hill, S. C. 
The entering wedge for any worth-while form of endeavor among a back- 
ward people is to arouse interest and community spirit. Consideration of 
various questions bound up in home betterment is far more likely to do this 
than the highly specialized teaching of chemistry, cooking and sewing. 
Women are up against household drudgery, they want to be diverted. They 
are too conservative to think things can be done in any but their traditional 
ways. Other members of the family are at work in the mills. They are 
heedless of household affairs and are likewise conservative. Once the interest, 
confidence and liking of the people are gained they will come to cooking and 
sewing classes and will receive suggestions concerning the running of the home, 
but none of these are best first steps. 
No successful work can be done in a mill community without the good 
will of the mill authorities, so the first step toward inaugurating home econom- 
ics in a mill community is to call upon the mill president. The degree to which 
he is interested and the state of the finances of the individual mill will deter- 
mine whether or not funds will be available for the work. 
Each community has its own peculiar conditions and problems which the 
social worker must try to sense. Each mill president has his own conceptions 
of what he wishes done. For example, one believes firmly in making the 
approach through the kindergarten; another will have none of it. The next 
president is convinced that the great need is to’ teach the women to cook, 
another asserts that, “It is impossible to teach an old dog new tricks.” Yet 
a third is convinced of the wisdom of night schools, while his neighbor believes 
in them not at all. 
But all agree in believing that the plan of work must be practical, that the 
work should be presented in logical order and the people themselves set to 
work out their own salvation. Demonstrations help always. They are con- 
vineing. For all of us are more or less like the man from Missouri who said, 
“Show it to me.” 
Work in home economics may be inaugurated in mill communities with 
or without financial help under any one of four conditions. First, without 
paid assistance but with local leadership; second, through utilizing some or- 
 
-P-A-G-E-319
     PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 315 
ganization as king’s daughter circles, civic improvement leagues, etc.; third, 
with the assistance of a paid teacher who devotes part of her time to the 
work plus the assistance of any local leadership available; fourth, with a 
trained worker in charge of the various activities which radiate from a 
community building. This community building thus becomes the centre 
of the social life of the village and of many forms of educational endeavor as 
well. 
If the mill management is willing to invest money in the work, difficulties 
lessen. The extension worker, or individual taking the initiative, helps to 
find the right woman for the position and helps to plan the work. This may 
well include cooking and sewing classes for children, for girls at work in the 
mill, and for housekeepers, a recreation evening, night school for the three 
R’s, and a mothers’ club with friendly visiting. 
If only a part-time worker is available cooking and sewing classes for 
children of school-going age, one for the girls at work in the mills and the 
guidance of a woman’s club are perhaps the best selection of activities to be 
furthered. This works well with part-time teachers in several mill villages in 
South Carolina. 
When there are no funds available but the mill president is interested, 
work may still be undertaken, if a local leader can be found. 
As the first move is to call upon the mill president, so the second move is 
as invariably to call upon the mill superintendent, upon the pastor of the 
church, if there is one in the village, at the schoolhouse, and upon the men 
and women who are most influential in the community. The names of village 
leaders will always be supplied by mill superintendent, pastor or teacher 
upon request. The co-operation of these leaders gained, it is not hard to 
bring about a mass meeting in the church or schoolhouse. I have never known 
the call for such a meeting to be poorly attended. The point is to gain the 
interest and liking of the crowd that gathers. This is not difficult if we 
remember that they are folks just like you and me. They will not stand one 
note of patronage; but they will meet kindliness, a common sense plan pre- 
sented with a human touch and interest with kindliness and courtesy. The 
interest of some will be gained. 
At this mass meeting it is well to tell what is being done in other mill com- 
munities, to tell of the pleasure and profit which a community house brings, 
of the possibility of bringing one to pass in this community “‘if we all get 
together.” 
It is well to crystallize interest by proposing to the women present to meet 
-on an afternoon in the same week. Urge that the women form a club for 
discussion of ways to do the work of the home, of ways to train the children, 
ete., so that each may profit by the ideas of all and have a good time as well. 
Show that such an organization may become a power for good. It is well 
to tell how such clubs have earned money for books, magazines, games, 
cooking equipment and dishes and are keeping open house one night each 
week at least, in quarters in which every member of the community may find 
a welcome and may have a good time. 
It is well to tell how at first the women were shy about trusting themselves 
to manage the open house evenings; but at the end of a few months they were

        SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
willing to try. It is splendid to watch the growth in self reliance and com 
munity spirit which comes to pass. They agree that if the experiment has been 
successful elsewhere that it may be so again and in their midst. 
Usually this story told at the mass meeting brings a good group of women 
out to meeting number two. 
At the second meeting the home economics worker must have every sense 
alert in order to sense conditions and must exercise every gift of mind and 
spirit in order to gain liking and good will. 
It is well to suggest several lines of work: Civic improvement through 
gardening, relief work among the sick, sewing circles and cooking classes, 
lessons in home nursing, are courses which will be found helpful and interest- 
ing. 
At this meeting it is well to effect club organization by the election of 
officers. 
The most successful first work of the club is often the making of sheets, 
pillow cases, night dresses and night shirts, of various sizes, to be loaned by 
the club to the sick upon application. The use of patterns may be taught 
and the various stitches when necessary. 
As the group sews there is a fine opportunity for the discussion of vital 
questions to the home such as the fly, wire screens, colds—their prevention 
and cure, infant feeding, the prices of foods, the use of meat substitutes, 
textile adulteration, conditions under which some other women work, in- 
considerate shopping, the labels on canned goods and their contents, the pos- 
sibilities of a home garden, your method and mine of securing obedience from 
the child, the wise spending of the family income, and better equipped kitchens. 
This is a wide range of topics, but undertaken with the hope of broadening 
the outlook while one specific endeavor is progressing: In the meantime the 
group and the leader learn to know each other and grow to feel themselves 
to be a unit ready to undertake some more difficult work. 
= The meeting is made more attractive by the serving of some light refresh- 
ments, such as coffee and wafers (tea is not popular in mill communities). 
Usually the mill management will bear this expense. Sometimes it is done 
by the women in turn. They enjoy the exercise of hospitality. 
If there are no funds available, a women’s club, with house to house meetings 
once a week in the afternoon, a recreation meeting once a week at the school- 
house (if there is no community house for either) is all that may be under- 
taken, and this cannot be done without a local leader other than one of the 
mill women to carry on the work between the visits of the supervisor. In 
South Carolina the inauguration and supervision of home economics in mill 
villages is a part of the extension work of Winthrop College. Welfare work is 
also done in various mill communities initiated by individual mill authorities. 
Usually, when the mill management sees that the women are really accom- 
plishing something they will give some substantial assistance. It is not 
logical, but most mill presidents wish the work to prove itself before the dif- 
ficulties in the way are lessened by any financial help. 
In several instances in South Carolina the announcement of the first evening 
entertainment by the women’s club has been recognized by a gift in money 
to further the work from the mill authorities and the use of a cottage.

‘ 
The responsibility of these entertainments should be upon the mill women- 
The leader should help but not dominate. The talent in village should be 
utilized. This insures the success of the entertainment. 
Tf the house is given for community use, the women will delight in making it 
ready. Community spirit is aroused by the effort put forth to furnish it. 
This presents a good opportunity for practical lessons in house furnishing. 
All the while the ideal of the larger service of which each woman is capable 
should be kept steadily before them. It is the duty of home economics work 
to reach men, women and children. 
One-fifth of the white people of South Carolina are members of mill com- 
munities. They are native born Americans, Anglo-Saxon stock. They are 
therefore capable of all things. Mill communities constitute a field ready for 
sowing—a field which, under wise cultivation, will yield a harvest of inestim- 
able value. : 
THE TEACHING OF HOME-MAKING IN A MILL COMMUNITY. 
Miss Elizabeth G. Holt, Athens, Ga. 
The John Milledge School, in Augusta, Ga., is a large, substantial brick 
building. It has twenty-five classrooms, a large auditorium, playground 
gymnasium, shower baths, sanitary drinking fountains, and all modern con- 
veniences. It is the most recently built and best equipped school building 
in the city. When it was proposed there were many to protest against the 
expenditure of such a sum of money in such a section. Quietly and with stead- 
fast purpose, however, those in authority persisted, and it stands a monu- 
ment to their wisdom and foresightedness, one of the most potent influences 
in civie welfare. 
On the third floor there are three large rooms well equipped for industrial 
training—a kitchen laboratory, a sewing room and a laundry. 
It-would take much time to tell and a volume to contain the full course of 
work that is carried on in these three rooms. It is my purpose at this time, to 
give you only the heart and soul of it all as it is summed up in the eighth or 
last grade, as I knew it to be in the year 1913, the last year of my connection 
with the system. 
The class was composed of twenty-four girls, who had had the regular 
course of industrial training from their fourth grade year. In their seventh 
grade year they had had a very thorough course in the cookery of the various 
breads. The eighth year course in cookery was based upon food principles 
as they should be combined in well-balanced ration in the three meals of the 
day to suit the different seasons of the year. The first third of the series of 
lessons were based upon breakfast menus, the second upon dinner menus, 
the third upon those for lunch or supper. All the ingredients used were 
selected from those commonly used in that section of the city and that were 
well within the means of the average family income. Every Monday morn- 
ing these girls as a class reported in the industrial training department and 
 
-P-A-G-E-322

remained there for three hours consecutively, receiving instructions in cook- 
ery, sewing and laundry work. 
Out on the grounds of the schoolyard there is a small cottage. It was there 
when the lot was purchased, having been occupied from time to time by 
various families of the community. 
In the year 1910-1911 the boys of the John Milledge School had it for the 
centre of their shop work. They remodeled the building and planned and 
constructed the furniture for each room. 
During this same year much of the art and handicraft work of the girls 
also was centered there. They made designs for curtains, portieres, cushion 
covers, etc. They applied these designs in the domestic art classes, using the 
homespuns that were spun and woven in the local mills. 
The general effect given by the mission furniture, the tones of cream and 
green and tan in the upholstery and curtains, and the few well chosen sepia 
prints on the walls that are tinted a solid tone blending and harmonizing with 
all the colors in the room, is most restful and pleasure giving, and full of sug- 
gestions to even the wealthiest visitors. Good taste is revealed in every line 
and in every tone of color. Simple and inexpensive, yet beautiful and useful. 
In the fall of 1911 we moved into the cottage, using it as a centre for all 
the work in the eighth grade and as a clubhouse for parent-teachers’ meetings 
and for the children’s social gatherings. 
The cottage is composed of an entrance hall, a small reading room, a large 
dining room, a passage between the dining room and the kitchen, a kitchen 
all white and well-planned, a bedroom, a bathroom, closets and pantries, 
front entrance, side living, and rear work porches, a front garden, a side 
lawn, and a rear vegetable and flower garden. 
In the year 1918 the eighth grade was divided into four sections, six girls 
in each, for work in the cottage. Each section came to the cottage two 
afternoons per week, every other week. Thus section A came Monday and 
Tuesday of one week, section B the same afternoons of the next. Section C 
came Wednesday and Thursday of one week, and section D the same after- 
noons of the next. 
Every Friday afternoon was devoted to the parents’ and the children’s 
social gatherings. 
The first afternoon of each section per week was occupied with training 
in housecleaning and household management in general. They learned 
through actually doing the work how to clean and arrange in the most sani- 
tary and convenient manner the various rooms of the house. The work was 
always thorough and complete, including walls, woodwork, windows, pictures, 
and furnishings. They studied the plumbing thoroughly, and understood 
the why and the how of sanitation in the bathroom, the value of proper 
ventilation, etc. 
Also, on the first afternoon they planned the menu for the meal to be pre- 
pared and served on the second afternoon. During the first third of the year 
these meals were breakfasts, during the second dinners, during the third lunch- 
eons or suppers, in correlation with the instruction given to the class as a 
whole in ‘the cooking lessons of the large morning school. 
The unit for these meals was a family of eight, the average size of the mill 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 319 
community family. This also furnished sufficient for the class of six, the 
teacher, and one invited guest. 
A limit of cost was always set. Each girl planned her menu for the par- 
ticular occasion. They were all discussed and compared and the best selected 
for application. In the beginning they planned them all together, under the 
direction of the teacher, to learn how to get the proper balance of food prin- 
ciples and to keep within the limit of cost. 
On one occasion I visited the school cottage and found them struggling 
with the problem of a breakfast at five cents per person. It was difficult 
to come down to such a small limit. I looked over the menu as it then stood. 
It included bacon and also butter. I suggested gravy made from the bacon, 
using a little milk, to substitute for the butter. They were delighted to figure 
it out to find that this brought it a little below the limit. 
In the garden throughout the entire season were raised vegetables to improve 
the diet, and flowers to add beauty to both the exterior and the interior of 
the cottage home. 
As you know, Augusta, Ga., is a city subject to floods. One Tuesday 
afternoon I visited the school to find that all the teachers had gone home 
hurriedly before 2 0’clock, alarmed by the report of the coming flood. They 
lived in the lower, or flood section of the city. The school is in a section above 
the flood line. 
Looking over to the cottage I noticed that the windows were open. Think- 
ing that in her hurry to get home the teacher had failed to close them, I went 
over to attend to it. The front door was open and I went through the cottage 
to the kitchen. 
There I found six of the happiest little girls I have ever seen. They were 
all singing a song. There was no sign of disorder in any part of the kitchen. 
The table was neatly and correctly laid for a luncheon. For home meals 
the kitchen was often used instead of the dining room. The dishes filled with 
well-cooked food were in the warmer of the stove. Even the sink was in 
order. Each girl was finishing some task before serving the meal. One, I 
remember, was arranging flowers in a vase. 
As-I entered they welcomed me most heartily and insisted that I should 
stay to lunch with them. 
“Where is Miss Moore (their teacher)?’’ I asked. 
They explained that she had had to go home upon the flood report, and 
that she had left them on their honor to do the work of the afternoon. 
This incident shows the spirit and the efficiency of the work done. 
On occasions, distinguished guests were entertained at the cottage. Grand 
juries, school officials, club women, ete. Once, Mr. Robert Ogden. 
It was always the custom for the guests to inspect the entire cottage be- 
fore being served, receiving a full explanation of the work. One object of 
taking them into the kitchen before the meal was to reassure them as to the 
general cleanliness. They were always surprised by the orderliness and neat- 
ness of the spotlessly white, well-arranged kitchen, and by the happy, cleanly 
dressed little housekeeper-cooks. : 
After the meal was served quickly, quietly, swiftly, silently, the guests

invariably and voluntarily sought the kitchen again to commend and praise 
their happy, willing, efficient cooks-maids-hostesses. 
Thus these little girls learned the truth that for womanhood there can be 
nothing more ennobling than the service of home-making and hospitality. 
Thus into their minds and into their lives were established ideals and habits 
that will forever lift them out of the drudgery and into the privilege of home- 
making. Thus slowly, but surely is being laid the foundation of civic welfare, 
the well-ordered home, in a section where it is most needed. Thus is the John 
Milledge School justifying the initial cost by the benefits that it is yielding, 
directly and indirectly to the entire city of Augusta.

PLACE—FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY. 
Wepnespay, Aprit 8, 1914—2:30 P. M. 
The meeting of the Libraries Department was called to order in the As- 
sembly Room of the Louisville Free Public Library by the president, Charles 
D. Johnston, Librarian Cossitt Library, Memphis, Tenn. 
It was voted on recommendation of the president to hold the business 
meeting first. 
Communications from the secretaries of the American Library Association 
and Southern Educational Association and the Louisville Free Public Library 
_ were read. 
It was moved and seconded that a note be sent Commissioner of Education 
P. P. Claxton, to be read at one of the general sessions of the Association, 
inviting teachers to participate in the meeting of the American Library 
Association at Washington, May 25-30. 
Nominations for the offices of president and secretary were declared in 
order, and Mr. Charles D. Johnston was named for another year. Mr. 
Johnston declined to serve again. 
Mr. R. M. Kennedy nominated Mr. George T. Settle, Librarian Louisville 
Free Public Library, as president, and Miss Jennie M. Flexner, Louisville 
Free Public Library, as secretary, and these two officers were elected by 
acclaim. 
The question of securing greater prominence for the work of the depart- 
ment was discussed informally and the following was moved and passed: 
Resolved, That if possible at future meetings of the Southern Educational 
Association, the Department of Libraries shall be represented by one long 
paper on the general program. 
The following resolution was then adopted: 
Resolved, That the thanks of the Libraries Department of the Southern 
Educational Association are hereby tendered to George T. Settle and the 
Louisville Free Public Library for so cordially extending to us the use of its 
building, and for all other courtesies. 
The meeting then adjourned.

THE COUNTY LIBRARY MOVEMENT. 
R. M. Kennedy, Columbia, S. C. 
The modern public library idea, with all of its far-reaching and won- 
derful energies, has begun to illuminate certain sections of the South; but, 
as a whole, I should say that our people are not yet awake to its immense 
power for good, and in some parts the light has not yet broken. 
The last report of the Bureau of Education on Libraries (1909) shows, for 
instance, that there were then only 149 free libraries of 1,000 volumes and over 
in the Southern States, including Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky and 
Oklahoma, as against 2,777 for the rest of the United States. Admitted that 
the greatest amount of library building in this section has been since that 
time, yet the ratio is still probably about the same. 
Again, not until this Department of Libraries was created in 1910 was the 
close relation—the unity of purpose—of the work of the school and the public 
library given due recognition in any Southern educational conference or associ- 
ation, so far as I am informed. 
Further, in all the present-day discussions of agencies for the betterment of 
social conditions among the agricultural classes in the South, the public 
library, it appears to me, has been almost overlooked—certainly not em- 
phasized. 
And yet the two activities of the modern library of greatest import for the 
future, perhaps, are the work with children and schools and the extension 
of its benefits to the rural districts. 
To the latter phase of the work, embracing as it does, to a certain extent, 
the former, I shall confine my remarks. 
The commission on country life, appointed by President Roosevelt, speci- 
fically named the library as one of the means of improving rural conditions, 
along with good roads, schools and churches; and Mr. Roosevelt himself 
characterized the free public library as, after the church and the school, 
“the most effective influence for good in America.” 
Prof. Gillette, of the University of South Dakota, writing on ‘‘Conditions 
and Needs of Country Life’ (Annals of American Academy), says: “A new 
outlook on life, its meaning, its possibilities of enjoyment and satisfaction 
and as to the means which are fit to secure those ends, is intensely needed. 
Life to the average farmer is devoid of the larger and more attractive elements. 
His life is a round of eating, working, sleeping, saving, economizing, living 
meagerly, recognizing only the bare necessities, skimping along with incon- 
veniences, especially in the home, which is uncalled for, considering his wealth. 
“In social matters, even to a greater degree than in those of finding satis- 
faction in living, the country is far behind the corresponding grades of city 
life. In one sense this dearth is due to a lack of intellectual stimulus and 
ferment. Reading has not been cultivated as a source of pleasure and a 
means of larger information. Social intercourse of a larger general nature is 
likely to be empty where an intellectual circulating medium is absent. A 
grasp and discussion of the more important social matters awaits the develop- 
ment of information.”

PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES — 323 
Miss Stearnes, of the Wisconsin Free Library Commission, in a paper on 
“The Woman on the Farm,’ quotes from letters she had received from two 
farmers’ wives. One said, “Once a library meant nothing but rows of books 
and its influence was confined to narrow limits. However, with the establish- 
ment of the traveling library, these books have become veritable missionaries, 
penetrating to all sorts of dreary isolated places, carrying with them a culture 
and a pleasure that wil] aid in illuminating the long weary path of existence 
with a color of happiness.” 
Another, more humorously, wrote: ‘Good books drive away neighborhood 
discussion of the four deadly d’s—diseases, dress, descendants, and domestics.” 
It will probably be admitted that the greatest number of the most book- 
famished people are to be found in the rural parts. The great problem is 
how to satisfy this book hunger most effectively at the smallest cost; and, 
in the South we have the additional problem of convincing the people that 
they are in dire need of this sort of ailment. What then, is the best plan for ' 
inspiring and gratifying a desire for good reading among the dwellers outside 
the towns? 
The recognized administrative units of library extension are: State, county, 
township, city. 
Thirty-six States of the union have provided for library commissions, a 
part of whose work is the administration of traveling libraries, sent out usually 
from the capital city. As a first step in the extension movement, this arrange- 
ment is perhaps necessary, and it will always'be needed in counties where 
there is a sparse population and no considerable town, or where the operation 
of any other unity is limited by the topography of certain sections of the 
country. 
The township system I shall briefly refer to later. 
The city unit is generally in rural extension work, I believe, combined 
to a certain extent with one of the other units named. 
The county as a unit first attracted my attention in a concrete illustration 
of its its actual operation that fell under my personal observation several 
years ago, and it so impressed me that I am going to let it argue its own case. 
I refer to the Washington County Free Library at Hagerstown, Md., a 
flourishing little mountain city of about 20,000 inhabitants. 
This library has been much in the prints of late, and you doubtless all 
know it by reputation. I agree with the writer who describes it as “the most 
ideal arrangement of rural extension in America today,” and this is my 
excuse for holding it up to you as a model of its kind, typical in some points, 
unique in others. 
It was founded in 1901, when the county library unit was still a matter of 
mere theoretical discussion among the profession. Its originators were: A 
German Reformed minister, two lawyers, a banker, a paper maker, a farmer 
and a merchant. 
Without a pattern—but influenced we are told, by the fact that the county 
is the unit of government in Maryland—they conceived the idea of a public 
library for Washington county, and proceeded to establish one. 
Their first and wisest step was to employ a trained librarian, Miss Mary L.  
-P-A-G-E-328
  324 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
Titcomb, of Massachusetts, and to her courage and remarkable executive 
ability is due in large measure, the great success of the experiment. 
Without going into unnecessary details, I shall call attention particularly 
to its extension features. 
1. It is absolutely free to every resident of the county. 
2. It sends books, on application, to any individual in the county, by post 
or express prepaid, the borrower being responsible for the return to the nearest 
station. 
3. It supplies supplementary reading and mounted pictures to every school 
in the county, including every grade in the city schools, and the assistant 
whose duty is to look after this department of the work makes occasional 
visits to each school in the county to become personally acquainted with the 
teachers. At the time I was last there, two years ago, an arrangement had 
practically been completed by which all the town and rural schools were to turn 
their separate libraries and library funds over to the central institution, de- 
pending entirely upon it for their book supplies, including professional litera- 
ture for teachers. Miss Titcomb reports that her first attempt to supply 
the country schools met with “semi-reluctant permission from the teachers.” 
Of its success and rapid development she cites one illustration, as follows: 
The Sweet Spring School opened in September with eighteen pupils, ten books, 
and four pictures from the library. The books were read twenty-six times, 
but seven pupils read no books and no single pupil read more than four. 
Each term there was an increase in the circulation until the fourth and last 
term of the session, which opened with twenty pupils, four of whom left 
soon to work in the fields. This term, the sixteen or eighteen pupils read the 
ten fresh books supplied 171 times, sixteen of them reading every book. 
4. There is the usual delightful children’s room, found in all progresive 
city libraries; but here again the extension idea operates, for the children’s 
librarian goes out periodically and conducts a “‘story hour” in the various 
schools of the town and county, carrying with her the printed originals for 
which she creates an appetite and which she leaves at the nearest deposit 
station to be borrowed and devoured. One other object here, as Miss Titeomb 
explains, is “to make the children conscious of the existence of the library, 
so that when they come to town the children’s room will be an objective 
point,” In other words, it is to induce among the little ones, even in the rural 
districts, the “library taste and habit.’’ In one or more instances, the chil- 
dren of a Branch, when grown too old for the story hour, have organized 
reading clubs among themselves. 
5. It supplies books to deposit stations in every section of the county 
(there were seventy-three in 1911). These are located where they will be 
most accessible, at a country store, a toll gate, a post-office, or, if nothing 
better offers, at a private house—the objection to the last being, of course, 
that it is not always open. Some of these stations have risen to the dignity 
of branch libraries, with their own custodians and reading rooms, where 
several good magazines may also be had. To the stations, boxes containing 
fifty or more books are sent, being returned every sixty or ninety days for 
fresh supplies. To the branches, as many as 300 books are first loaned as a 
nucleus, exchanges for some new material being made every ten days.
-P-A-G-E-329
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 320 
6. Printed bulletins and book-lists are issued regularly, of interest to both 
city and country, and occasional exhibits are made on special subjects (loans 
frequently from larger libraries, such as the Congressional), which do duty 
afterward at the country branches. 
7. But’ the prime distinction—the unique (at the time) and vital feature 
—of the librar'y is its free delivery of books by its now famous “library wagon,” 
not only to all the schools, deposit stations and branches in the county, but, 
for several years past, from house to house. This delivery wagon, built to 
hold several cases of books for stations, as well as more than 200 volumes 
on open shelves, goes on its twenty-four successive routes two days of each 
week, weather permitting, covering, every six weeks or two months, the 
entire county even to the “most distant outposts.” The area thus served is 
over 500 square miles, with a rural population of more than 30,000, besides 
the 20,000 citizens of Hagerstown. 
Less than two years ago the book wagon was destroyed by collision with a 
train, but the citizens of Hagerstown at once raised funds for the purchase 
of a much quicker and more efficient “library automobile” to continue 
the good work. As Miss Titcomb says in one of her reports: ‘No better 
method has yet been devised of reaching the dweller in the back country. 
We all know that we might wait long before a busy farmer would drive five, 
ten or fifteen miles for a coveted volume. The man who drives the wagon 
at once establishes a human relationship between the library and the farmer, 
a thing no deposit station can do. Psychologically too the wagon is the thing. 
It is the unknown brought to the very threshold. As impossible to resist 
the pack of the peddlar from the Orient as a shelf fal of books when the doors 
of the wagon are open at one’s gateway.” 
“World’s Work” for February, 1913, has an article on this delivery system, 
entitled, ‘Getting Books to the People,” which is reviewed in “Literary Digest” 
under the caption, “Motoring Books to the People.” The book wagon is 
termed “the most useful automobile in the United States,”’ and dwelling upon 
its “infinitely” valuable work the writer says: “It won its way into the hearts 
of the lonely ignorant people. They had been too indifferent, too hard 
worked, to seek the traveling library station, even though conveniently placed; 
but, when Miss Titcomb drove up to the very doors, even the stubbornest 
enemies of literature gave in. What that droll little wagon did to brighten 
isolated homes and to lead young people into better paths can hardly be 
estimated.” 
At the risk of too many quotations, I must extract a few lines from Miss 
Titcomb’s latest report. After saying that sometimes the dangerous condition 
of the lanes made some farmhouses inaccessible to the delivery wagon, she 
continues: ‘In such cases word is sent upon arrival, at the nearest neighbor’s, 
and often the car is surrounded by borrowers, baskets on their arms in which 
to carry away the books. Lists of books are sometimes presented, or informa- 
tion is asked on some topic. The bulletins of agricultural books, belonging 
to the library, distributed at the farmers’ institutes, have been of real use. 
One farmer asked for “How to Grow 100 Bushels of Corn to the Acre,” 
“Fertilizers,” “Soils,’’ “Pruning Book,’’ “Book of Alfalfa,” ‘Book of Wheat,” 
“Principles of Soil Management,” “Ginseng Culturist’s Guide Book’’—all
-P-A-G-E-330

taken from the Bulletin. It is necessary to duplicate freely all and everything 
pertaining to agriculture, domestic science, nursing, care of the baby, etc. 
While, as a recent critic has pointed out, these are not properly books at all, 
but come in the catalogue of time tables, telephone directories and other 
agencies of civilized life, still they help to raise the economic conditions and 
pave the way for books which interest and inspire. 
“The demand for children’s books is constant, a healthy sign. Sometimes 
mothers who do not read themselves borrow something to read to the chil- 
drén.. For the rest—history, biography, travel, devotional works, and not 
too great a proportion of fiction, fill the country demands.” 
The Washington county library has about 25,000 volumes. Its circulation 
in 1912-1913 was 115,112. Of these over 32,000 went among the people in 
the country, and 6,000 books were borrowed from the open shelves of the car. 
Its income of about $12,000 is derived from interest on a comparatively 
small endowment, supplemented by annual appropriations of $1,000 from the 
city and $1,500 from the county. Andrew Carnegie has recently given $25,000 
to aid with its extension work, attracted doubtless by the fame of the book 
wagon, about which, by the way, inquiries have come from even far-away 
Japan. 
Its force consists of the librarian, a children’s librarian, a school assistant 
who is also a cataloguer, a desk attendant, two or more apprentices serving 
on nominal pay, and the driver of the delivery wagon; with a salary list of 
about $4,800. 
Now, to my mind, this city-county system at Hagerstown has all the 
essentials of a successful unit for rural extension work, which I gather largely 
from expert opinion on the subject,* should be about as follows: 
1. The unit must not be too large for close and easy supervision, and for 
the influence of the library staff to be felt in a knowledge of local conditions 
and by personal acquaintance with the patrons. This has been one trouble 
with the State-operated traveling library system, the want of personal touch. 
2. It should centre in a library of considerable size and resources, which 
can be found usually only in a large town or city. I do not like that feature 
of the California law which exempts a town, even the county seat, from the 
operation of the county system if it already has a public library and does not 
wish to come in. 
3. This centre must also be the natural and commercial centre of the 
community to be served. In the South generally this is to be found at the 
county seat. 
4. The directing head, or librarian, must be an individual of tact, strong 
character and fine executive ability, and the library force must be ample, 
intelligent and trained. Such service commands good salaries. 
5. To secure efficient machinery for the working of such a system, the entire 
library resources of the unity should be controlled by the central institution, 
in order to prevent dissipation of energy and duplication of effort. 
6. The unit should be small enough for a free delivery system to be operated 
without waste of time and expense.

  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES py AL 
This delivery, in any up-to-date system of the future, must be, of course, 
by wagon from farmhouse to farmhouse. The plucky little Maryland city 
has placed herself in the forefront of progress in this matter and pointed the 
way. Delaware has recently followed the lead and provided for house to house 
delivery throughout the State. 
In another respect, already briefly discussed, Hagerstown, has, in my 
judgment, taken a long step in advance. I refer to her treatment of the school 
library problem. 
My own experience—and it is, I believe, the general experience—teaches 
that schools are, as a-general rule, not successful in handling their libraries, 
particularly rural schools. I shall not stop to point out the obvious reasons 
for this failure, the principal one being, doubtless, lack of time and library 
training on the part of the teacher. I shall rather briefly call attention to 
some of the gains to be had from allowing the central library to do all ora 
greater part of the library work for both town and country schools. 
1. The book selection in trained hands, will be more judicious and therefore 
less wasteful. 
2. Duplication of reading matter will be largely avoided—hence a great 
saving in expense. 
3. Each school will get the benefit of a considerable assortment of litera- 
ture, instead of the limited amount it could individually afford. In California, 
for instance, under this co-operative county system, it is stated that, where 
high schools formerly averaged $100 for book supplies, each school now gets 
the benefit of over $2,000 worth of books, per year. 
4, The life of a book will be much greater, owing to the expert care in re- 
pairs and rebinding received at the central library. 
5. Most important of all, by means of frequent renewal of material and by 
the use of those devices to excite interest which the trained librarian knows 
best how to handle, the school library becomes a real and quickening energy, 
instead of the lifeless thing it generally is, and the step to the habitual use 
of the “big” library is an easy one. 
In this connection, I like the arrangement, made first in the city of Buffalo, 
I think, by which the school and classroom libraries are not entirely dispensed 
with, but are limited to works of reference, the public library supplying all 
other literature required. 
A word may be said as to the cost of service by the county extension 
plan. Mr. Dudgeon, of the Wisconsin Free Library Commission, has pre- 
pared statistics showing that the expense of circulating each volume, in the 
country alone, at Hagerstown, is $0.056, and by the Wisconsin county travel- 
ing library system is $0.052, ‘as against $0.128, the average of all city libraries 
in six representative States. He does not, I am sorry to say, give the cost of 
the State traveling library system, which also is doubtless greater. 
Miss Isom, of Portland, Ore., library, answers another interesting ques- 
tion that suggests itself: ‘Does a county library pay?” In the ten years, 
she tells us, since Portland expanded from a city to a county library, the 
county has gained 119 per cent. in population, and in the first six years under 
the new system the circulation of the central library increased 212 per cent. 
One other strong point in favor of the system under discussion is the fact
-P-A-G-E-332
  328 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
that it must tend to draw the people of a county closer together, removing 
the narrow prejudice, or class antagonism, that so often exists in the minds 
of a rural population against the town and its citizens. 
It was never my intention, nor would time permit me, to go into the his- 
tory of the county library movement. Suffice it to say that the first ex- 
periment with this unity was made, it appears, in Van Wert county, Ohio, 
in 1898, with the Brumback library, which differs from that at Hagerstown 
in that its support has always come directly from taxation. 
The second to be established was the one which has been really the subject. 
of my paper. 
Since that time, the idea has been steadily growing in favor. It is now State- 
wide in California, and has been adopted locally in Indiana, Kentucky, 
Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, 
Texas, Wisconsin, and perhaps in other States about which I am not informed. 
Nor do I advocate the county unit under all circumstances or to the ex- 
clusion of the others, as already suggested in the case of State-operated 
traveling libraries. : 
In rich populous counties, where there are several large towns—conditions 
that are rare in the South—the same arguments used for the city-county 
system would apply, with equal or greater force, in favor of a township unit, 
such as has been very successful in Indiana and other Middle-Western States. 
There, any town or city may establish a library and get support for it from 
its own and neighboring townships. In this way it may extend to all the town- 
ships in a county, but usually is confined to the three or four contiguous ones, 
not necessarily all in the same county. 
Indeed a very natural sort of development of a county system, it seems 
to me, would be by expansion from the public library at the county seat, 
assuming there is or may be one. 
A great many States have passed acts enabling any rural unit of govern- 
ment—township or county—to contract for library service with the nearest 
public library. Under such a law, adjacent townships might be induced to 
come in, as a “starter,’”’ with a view of ultimate extension to the entire county. 
I have heard of one town that tried the experiment of extending its library 
privileges to the people of the neighboring country as an advertising medium, 
with marked success financially, and the result that the rural patrons, soon 
voluntarily voted a tax upon themselves that they might have a right to the 
enjoyment of the library. 
Which goes to prove that where it is possible to give the people a practical 
demonstration of the value of modern library service, it is not hard to secure 
their support of it by taxation. 
Ignorance of this service is the principal drawback, of course, to public 
library development in the South. 
The ever retarding “negro problem’ has been another obstacle, as was the 
case when the tax-supported free school system was inaugurated; but experi- 
ence is proving that the public library in the South can handle that question 
as easily as did the public schools. 
It is my opinion that one county library in each State of the Hagerstown 
type, with its almost ideal rural-extension features—if even one such could be 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 329 
established, by whatever means—would be an object lesson that, more speedily 
and effectually than any other agency I can now conceive, would place the 
public library where it should be in the minds of our people, as an unexcelled 
instrument of social uplift and equally with the schools worthy of support by 
popular taxation. 
The library field in the South presents great opportunities for constructive 
work of the highest order of talent and public service, and rich will be the 
returns. 
HOW THE STATE MAY AID SCHOOL LIBRARIES. 
Mrs. Pearl Williams Kelly, Nashville, Tenn. 
A large number of our States are active commonwealths in combining all 
possible organized efforts to advance educational results in the local communi- 
ties, individual schools, and scattered farm houses. Out of this activity have 
come voluntary reading circles for people, teachers, and pupils, and out of 
these voluntary organizations have come good libraries for our schools, and 
superior public libraries for towns and cities. 
The State of Tennessee is an example of this combined effort, since custom 
and law, as well as public interest, have made it possible to place good books 
for general reading within the reach of every child in every public school. 
Tennessee, from east to west, is a State of magnificent distances, increased 
in the east by its mountains, which make beautiful the scenery and isolate the 
people. Its population is so richly diversified by race, forest, mine and low- 
land, that the amalgamating of it, through time and culture, into one glorious 
blend is a game, the zest of which only increases as the promise draws nearer 
fulfilment. 
School libraries have been a part of the educational scheme since 1909, 
by authority of a State law passed by the General Assembly of that year. 
The State met the school half-way in its endeavor to establish and maintain 
school libraries, aiding to the extent of $20 on its first order for books, and 
$10 annually on subsequent orders, provided the school itself raise and ap- 
propriate for the purpose an equal amount. For some years little advantage 
was taken of this privilege, as it was a work without special supervision. To 
further stimulate and aid effort in this direction, the Legislature of 1913 
amended the school library law in a very generous manner, allowing dollar 
for dollar-——duplicating the amount raised by each school—up to $40 to sup- 
plement or establish a school library, and creating the office of director of 
library extension. This office has concerned itself with promoting school 
library interests in general, improvement of the rural school libraries, mak- 
ing school library aids available, urging instruction in the use of books in the 
high schools, and more work in children’s literature in the normal schools,, 
attempting to raise the standard of service in school libraries, correlating the 
school libraries and the public libraries, giving advice in organization and the 
compiling of the list from which books must be chosen, and letting the con- 
tract for supplying them to schools, the preparation of special, suggestive  
-P-A-G-E-334
  330 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
lists to assist the country teacher in selecting books, pupil’s reading circle 
lists, exhibits and talks at school meetings. 
It may readily be imagined that the raising of $20, or even $10, for book- 
buying in some isolated district, where the battle with hardship is still going 
on, entails much courage, persistence, tact, and self-sacrifice on the part of 
those who undertake it. County school fairs that are held annually, have 
contributed very materially to broaden the spirit and open the pockets of our 
district fathers; but it is mainly to the skilful generalship and unflagging 
enthusiasm of the teachers that we owe thanks for results attained. 
The benefits accruing from these small rural and civic school libraries have 
been so palpable that it seems safe to say already library acquisition is making 
its appeal to the people. The remotest and most unsettled counties of the 
State have been penetrated by an interest in the good-book movement, and 
are responding to an unexpected and gratifying degree. 
The effort to benefit the rural school libraries has met with hearty support 
and co-operation on the part of the county superintendents. Whenever the 
county superintendent takes an interest in the work it makes surprising prog- 
ress. The superintendents have distributed lists and aids to the schools and 
have given place on the program of their teachers’ meetings for discussion of 
rural school library and its needs. 
In many schools the library consists of only a shelf or two of books, not 
more than a dozen or twenty. Then comes a table or corner devoted to its 
interests, and finally a room equipped with furniture, books and periodicals, 
with pictures adorning the walls, and plants and flowers adding to the ap- 
pearance of the room. No part of the school is so much enjoyed, or educates 
so fully and broadly. The story hour becomes a most attractive feature. 
If a bulletin board can be installed with attractions for each month, with a 
reading list of books always accompanying it, every book listed may be 
drawn into circulation. 
Proverbially, the farmer and his wife and their children are hurried along 
with the week-a-day affairs and tend gradually to acquire the non-reading 
habit. This is bad for the parents in that it keeps their minds running 
around upon a little cycle of hard, industrial facts. It is worse for the chil- 
dren in that it fails to supply proper nourishment for their growing minds. 
It is needless to say that the rural school library’s chief function is to nourish 
and build up the best possible thought activities of the country boy and girl. 
The school library forms a strong bond between the school and the home. 
Books taken home by the children are frequently read by the parents and older 
members of the family, thus bringing whole families in touch with the child’s 
book, and the boy and girl comes back telling the teacher “I read the book 
and then my pa he read it and said it was just as good a book for him as it 
was for me.” Parents who never had good books to read in their youth take 
up the volumes their children bring home and get a glimpse into a world where 
everything is not expressed in the terms of dollars and cents. 
Yet with all our efforts library facilities are still tragically inadequate 
everywhere. We still have in Tennessee a number of counties of the same 
old opinion that the country boy may go to school only when his services are 
not required in the field—which means three months schooling out of the
-P-A-G-E-335

twelve. After the corn is husked in the fall, the boy enters school, and at 
the first sign of spring he is called away to begin preparation for the new 
season’s crop. During these sixty days the growing child is supposed to pick 
up the rudiments of learning and by the time maturity is reached to have 
worked himself out of the ranks of the illiterate. He has learned to read, 
but very falteringly, never so that reading may bea joy tohim. In such coun- 
ties a strong effort is always made to place the school library in the home of 
some public spirited citizen who will circulate the books among the children 
during the long vacation period. 
I heard recently, in a town of over 5,000 population, which has no free 
public library, and not until a few months ago a high school library, of a girl 
in high school who was a most excellent student, who yet asserted that she 
never in her life had read a single book outside of those in her school course. 
She had been getting lessons, but she had never learned to read. She had 
been piling up credit, not cu‘ture. The teachers had been keeping school, 
rather than teaching school. 
So long as we send as teachers into the country schools boys and girls who 
should be in school themselves, we may not hope fo: children to be taught 
what to read, but merely how to read. 
With the establishment and growth of school libraries comes a marked 
demand for rural teachers to realize that the school library is an important 
part of the school equipment. They should know something of good books 
for children, and how to use books intelligently, how to use the State school 
library list from which they are required to select the books. 
To assist the country teacher, wholly without library training, an outline 
for this instruction has been included in the State adopted list, taking up the 
purpose of the rural school library, some principles of book selection, expla- 
nation of the State list, how to order and care for the library, some sugges- 
tions on the use of it, a suggestive list of typical children’s books for required 
reading, and a list of books to read aloud, or for story telling, in the country 
school. There is an urgent need and demand for our normal schools to in- 
clude in their curriculum a course on administering and using a school library. 
This course should be compulsory, not elective. No student should be al- 
lowed to graduate without having twenty weeks of elementary library methods. 
Every prospective teacher needs some knowledge of books and library methods 
and usage to help her in her work, for she goes either to a school in a town 
where there is a public library to be used and worked with, to a school having 
a library to be put in working order, or to one where a school library is to be 
bought. In any case she should get, in connection with her normal course, 
such knowledge of books or tools as will help her to be a more efficient teacher 
as well as to direct the reading of children under her care. The increasing 
tendency to consolidation of schools by providing transportation facilities 
to pupils whose homes are at a considerable distance, will serve in the end to 
build up larger and more generally useful school libraries which will be the 
true and logical community center. These libraries will be kept open on 
Saturdays. 
There is also need and opportunity in many places for centralizing school 
libraries. It is desirable to have provisions whereby rural schools may make 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
  332 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
agreement for a specified period with a central public library, for library 
service. 
Such an agreement should include turning over to the central public library 
all the library books other than reference, and the fund which the school 
expends for library purposes, the school to become a branch of the central 
library and to receive from its traveling libraries for the use of the pupils. 
The State to aid such libraries to the amount which would have been given 
to schools. All books furnished in this way to be selected from a list provided 
by the Department of Public Instruction and a committee on which the de- 
partment is represented to decide whether the librarian of the central library 
is competent to undertake the work. Such combinations are authorized in 
California by the county library law. 
The advantages to. the school would come in having the help of a librarian 
in selecting the books suited to the needs of the pupils; of having always good 
books in good condition and of being able to supply fresh reading matter 
when all the books had been read. 
Provision should also be made whereby schools in towns having a good 
public library, may turn over their books of general reading to be administered 
and cared for. The advantage lies in training children to go to the public 
library for help, and having the books cared for, kept in order, and used to 
the best advantage. 
The public school library advance in Tennessee has been decidedly notable 
during the past year, the dollar for dollar offer on the part of the State has 
given remarkable impetus to the growth of libraries in our common schools. 
There has been a total expenditure of $29,318 by the schools for books 
appearing on the State approved list. This outlay represents the purchase 
of about 75,000 volumes by more than 2,500 schools. 
The work of the public school library is strongly reinforced by the travel- 
ing libraries sent out by the State library. By means of the traveling library 
the farmer, the mechanic, the villager, the teacher, and the pupil can all be 
mutually helped through State co-operation. It is by such agencies as this 
that the people are being brought to a better understanding of the function 
of the State as a benevolent and fostering institution and are able to appre- 
ciate the value of good books when the State aids in their purchase for the 
youth of the commonwealth, and brings the right book at the right time to 
the very doors of the homes of the common citizen. 
One of the most significant movements of the present day library is that 
which has for its object the education of the adult population. The day 
has happily past when the last day of school for any individual is his educa- 
tional day of judgment. 
The university of the people consists of the newspaper, the magazine, the 
periodical for various trades and professions, the free public library, the cor- 
respondence school and other agencies of enlightenment, whose great function 
it is to educate the adult population, depend for their success upon the desire 
of the people to read, and upon their ability to read with discrimination. It 
is this desire and this ability which the school library, rightly used, will call 
into existence. 
This has been termed the ‘“‘Children’s Century” since the home, the school
-P-A-G-E-337
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 333 
and the library are all working along the same lines to develop the child, the 
coming citizen, for a broad and useful life. 
With all these forces, animated by one strong, intelligent spirit of well- 
doing, working toward one common end, Tennessee may just y feel, despite 
natural discouragements, that we are.making some permanent provision for 
the material welfare, the moral dignity, the mental integrity, sanity, and 
growth of our children’s children. 
With these facts in mind, the successful growth and development of school 
libraries in Tennessee, which have marked the last five years, cannot but be 
viewed with gratification by every friend of enlightenment and progress. 
Tennessee is rapidly preparing to educate all the people all the time. 
THE RELATION OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AND THE PUBLIC 
SCHOOL FROM THE LIBRARIAN’S VIEWPOINT. 
Bernice W. Bell, Louisville, Ky. 
The Public Library as an educational factor in the community has come 
into prominence within the last twenty years. 
The first American Library Association met in Philadelphia in 1876. This 
meeting marked the beginning of a change in the attitude of the public toward 
the public library. Up to this time, the public library as an aid in the training 
of children had not been recognized by municipalities or educational asso- 
ciations as an institution equal in importance to the public school or even 
considered as an aid in educational matters. 
The public library idea today is to begin with the child and by graded read- 
ing educate him to better reading. The establishemnt of well administered 
children’s departments for the purpose of teaching the child what to read 
will, without doubt, train boys and girls to enjoy the great books of a!l ages. 
Year by year, we who are interested in the development of the library idea, 
have been watching with keen pleasure the growth of its influence and recog- 
nition and earnestly hope that the day will come when every child will have 
access to the best books. 
One day when John Gutenberg was worn with fatigue, he leaned his head 
upon the frame-work of his printing press. Suddenly from among the type 
two voices were heard. ‘Happy man,’ said the first voice, “let him go on 
with the work he has begun, books will now be plentiful and cheap and the 
poorest man may have the words of the wise and the good in printed form, 
and the age of ignorance will be at an end.” The other voice said, ‘Let 
John Gutenberg beware of what he is doing. His invention will even prove 
a curse rather than a blessing to mankind. It is true, books will be plentiful 
and cheap but they will not all be good books.” The voices continued, one 
claiming the printing press would be a blessing, the other saying it would 
surely be a curse. John Gutenberg was distressed and suddenly seized a 
hammer and was about to break his press into pieces. ‘‘It shall not be said 
that Gutenberg helped to make the world worse,” he said. The first voice
-P-A-G-E-338
    334 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
spoke again, ‘The best of God’s gifts may be abused and yet they are all 
good. The art of printing will enlighten the world. Its power for blessing 
will be a thousand times greater than its power for doing harm.” Gutenberg 
staid his hand. 
The printing press is the mechanical device for the multiplication of books, 
but the public library is the pulsating organization for the distribution of 
the best books that each generation produces. The chief function of the pub- 
lic library is to educate and improve the reading taste of the masses and the 
first step in this good work is to reach and encourage every child. When the 
public library fails to do this, it is not doing its duty and should not be sup- 
ported by public taxation. 
One of the brightest signs of the times is the establishment of a close rela- 
tionship between the two great educational factors of today, the library and 
the school. The best way for the library to develop the right reading habit 
in the community is to unite its work closely with the schools. Although 
the public library is a younger institution, the initiative has come from the 
library, the schools in many places remaining more or less passive. 
Children’s librarians have realized perhaps more fully than the teachers 
in our schools, the meaning to the child of developing in early childhood a 
discriminating sense of the best literature. Children’s librarians have labored 
hard to convince superintendents, teachers and the parents of the value and 
helpfulness of the public library in its work with the schools to attain this end. 
The mission of the public library and the school is the same. It is the work 
of both to train the mind. There has been much said about how things 
ought to be, but little has been said about how to meet conditions as they 
exist in our cities, towns and villages to make them as they ought to be. 
Children’s librarians have dreamed of the time when every teacher would 
be an assistant librarian and every librarian an assistant teacher and when 
every community would have efficient leaders to direct the reading habits 
of both parents and teachers and when every school room would have a 
library. 
The questions are: ‘How can the public, parochial and private schools 
be supplied with books that every child should read and know? How are 
we to awaken the interests of parents to the importance of buying only the 
the best books for children? How is this to be brought about?’ The time 
for outlining a theory for this work is past. This is the day of practical 
examples. I might take up all the time that has been assigned to me in say- 
ing why things should be so and so but I propose to tell you why things are so 
and so by using the work that has been done in the Louisville Free Public 
Library as an example.

Tuurspay, APRIL 9, 2:30 P. M. 
In the absence of both president and secretary, Mrs. Cora Wilson Stewart 
presided and Mrs. Charles P. Weaver acted as secretary. 
The acting president called the meeting to order, and the first speaker was 
Miss Wil Lou Gray, of South Carolina, on ‘(Co-operation in City and County 
Work.” 
This was followed by a discussion. 
The second speaker was Miss Mabel C. Williams, of Shelby county, Tenn., 
on “How the Town Library May Serve the Country Community.” 
Mrs. R. H. Lacey, of Franklin, Ky., President of the Kentucky Federation 
of Women’s Clubs, then spoke on, “(How the Club May Help.” 
This was followed by an enthusiastic discussion, led by Miss Ernestine 
Noa, of Tennessee, in which it was recommended that the State federation 
be the clearing house for all volunteer women’s activities, rather than en- 
courage the organization of additional societies. 
In the absence of the next two speakers, Misses Hutt and Harris, Miss 
Merker, of Louisville, led a discussion on the necessity for beauty in every- 
day life—asking that workers everywhere begin by aiming for greater beauty 
on State fair grounds in all States. 
The secretary read announcements handed in by Mr. Clayton. 
The election of officers followed. Mrs. Charles P. Weaver, of Louisville, 
was elected president, Mrs. T. J. Smith, of Frankfort was elected secretary. 
There being no further business, the meeting adjourned. 
CO-OPERATION IN BUILDING A COUNTRY SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
Miss Wil Lou Gray, Laurens, S. C. 
   The subject, “Co-operation in Building a Country School System,” will 
not be treated relative to one community, but county wide. It has only 
been within the past decade that the term, country school system, has come 
into vogue. For years each individual school in the county was permitted to 
run along in its own hap-hazard fashion. The educators finally caught the    
-P-A-G-E-340
    
      336 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
  inspiration of the word ‘“‘team-work,” since which time there has been won- 
derful development. 
A successful system of country schools perhaps requires the co-operation 
of more different types of people than any other enterprise; the educated, 
the ignorant, the young, the old, the good, the bad, the liberal minded, the 
narrow-minded, the rich, the poor, the landlord, the tenant farmer. Often 
times the reason for lack of co-operation is that the people do not know where 
to co-operate. Realizing this, the county school officials of my county, Laurens, 
S. C., early in the year, held a meeting in which they discussed the ways and 
means of getting community co-operation, and made plans for the year. 
A letter, setting forth these plans, was immediately published in the county 
papers and mailed to the teachers and trustees. The responsibility of their 
position was stressed, and earnest co-operation requested. One suggestion 
in the letter was that, in order to have more uniformity, all eight and nine- 
months’ schools should open on a certain day—seven-months’ schools one 
month later, and six-month schools still another month later. 
In order that the teachers might be more thoroughly acquainted with this 
plan, a teachers’ institute was held in Laurens just before the opening of the 
sixth months’ session of school. The schools in session were dismissed for a 
day and a half. Never has the principle of co-operation been better illus- 
trated than on this occasion. The trustees and patrons gave their support, 
the State officials their services, the residents of Laurens their homes, the 
teachers their individual enthusiasm and interest. It was a conference of 
practical definite suggestions. The teachers also had the opportunity of 
observing the work in Laurens graded schools, which work had been especially 
prepared to meet the needs of the country schools. 
The County Teachers’ Association has been one of the greatest means 
whereby our school system has gained unity. Here the teachers meet once 
a month, discuss their problems, and hear them discussed by men, professionals 
in their line. Believing that one appreciates most the things that are paid for, 
a small fee of one dollar is required. This not only entitles one to membership 
in the county association, but in the State association also. So well has this 
plan worked, that recently Laurens county won the trophy cup offered by the 
State association to the county having the largest per cent. of teachers present 
at the annual State meeting. Through this medium the teachers are being 
drilled in the lessons of co-operation and the dignity of their calling, Darwin’s 
theory, ‘The survival of the fittest,” is being demonstrated—those who are 
not falling in line are gradually being dropped. It is at these meetings that 
monthly plans are made and some definite work for the following months 
given. Thus, the teachers realize that each school is only a part of the whole, 
which cannot be perfect if they fail to carry out their part. 
Co-operation of the town and country—in order that the teachers might 
have a home in Laurens, the grand jury kindly consented to give the use of 
their beautiful room in the courthouse for a teachers’ rest room. This was 
furnished with home-made mission furniture. 
Some of the money for the equipment was raised by having a lecturer come 
from a nearby college, the other portion paid from county funds. The room 
is attractive and home-like, containing a beautiful table, writing desk, a book-
-P-A-G-E-341
PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 337 
case, the teachers’ library, a sand table, a tabourette, settees and chairs. 
One of the book stores decorated the walls with beautiful pictures, suitable 
for the schoolroom, and “The Advertiser,’ a county paper, presented the room 
with stationery. Before each teachers’ meeting an appropriate sand table is 
arranged, the bulletin board filled with suggestive material for the ensuing 
month, and helpful magazines are placed on the table. Arrangements have 
been made to have the teachers served occasionally with a light lunch. The 
room was opened last fall with an informal reception, when “at home” cards 
were sent to every teacher; also to members of the Chamber of Commerce, 
editors and ministers. This comfortable resting place has become a great 
factor in the upbuilding of county school spirit. The teachers appreciate the 
effort of the county educational department in their behalf. These courtesies 
are forcing them to realize that, as a body, they are respected and that each 
individual teacher must sustain the dignity of all. 
In order to have an ideal country school system, the county officers should 
not only be closely identified with the teachers, but with the pupils. This 
has been done in Laurens by the giving of library certificates, perfect attend- 
ance buttons, and the School Journal. The children are made to feel that 
they are a part of a great system whose success depends on their allegiance. 
The School Journal, a monthly magazine, contains various departments— 
literary, athletic, current events, locals. The pupils are the editors. It is 
their paper. The superintendent overlooks the business department, and I 
the literary matter. So much interest has been taken in this, that, at times, 
as much material is destroyed as is published. The teachers write ‘Please 
put this in, for this pupil has tried so hard.’ The locals of all the schools 
and the letter department have served a wonderful purpose. Here is reported 
the monthly happenings in the various schools which prove an incentive to 
others. 
Next in importance to the interest of the children in upbuilding the schools 
comes the influence of the women, for, through them, the men become inter- 
ested. They have been made to feel a part of the school system by their work 
in the school improvement association. In my county the county board offers 
$5 to every school organizing such an association, reporting monthly, and 
raising as much as $10. Every woman is interested in the development of 
her home, which includes the school. Thirty of the schools will win this small 
prize. The women have been delighted to share the responsibilities of the 
teacher. It is only through the combined effort of teachers and women that 
the schoolhouses can ever be made a social centre. The following quotations 
from reports will show how gladly the women have become part of the schools: 
The association at Odells, writes: ‘We have decided to have the January 
meeting January 30th, and invite the pastor, Mr. Friday, to come and give a 
talk and see if we can get a full attendance. We had our Christmas exercises 
Christmas Eve night—exercises by the children and songs by the members 
of the association. All the parents and children were present.”” The secretary 
at Goldsville, says, “At our meeting we covered letters to be used at the Christ- 
mas exercises, appointed committees, arranged for serving oysters after Christ- 
mas exercises, and served refreshments.” When the school improvement 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
338 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
spirit gets into a community, it is no longer the “teacher’s school,” but “our 
school.”” 
There is nothing which so fosters co-operation as having a common purpose. 
With us the purpose has been the “school fair.” A successful county fair 
means co-operation in the highest sense—the county officials, the teachers, 
the trustees, the farmers, who are forced to stop a plow; the parents, the pupils 
the merchants, in fact, everybody in the country and town. This annual 
testing of the pupils of each school has served a wonderful purpose in the 
development of the country school system. The school which does not co- 
operate spells failure. 
For years the schools were so one-sided that it was impossible for those 
people who were not of a literary turn to make common cause with the teacher. 
The introduction of the corn club, the tomato club, the home-makers’ club, 
and the experimental school plat has so broadened the curriculum, that there 
is now a place for all kinds of talent. These clubs form the bridges between 
the homes and the schools. The best farmers in the community should be 
consulted in regard to the experimental plat and immediately they will feel, 
in a way, responsible for its success. So it is with the housewife, who should 
come as a teacher in regard to home affairs. 
The one thing most necessary in building a country school system is the 
co-operation of the newspapers. Miss Russell, in one of her reports, says, 
“The rural schools need to be popularized—they need advertisement.” The 
people need to realize just how important a school is to a community, a town, 
a county. They need to know what the other people are doing, then they, 
like sheep, will follow. The scattering of information will be well-nigh im- 
possible if it were not for the universal courtesy of the county papers. Last 
year ‘‘The Advertiser,” one of our county papers, volunteered to issue an educa- 
tional edition of the paper, incident to the school fair. A space was given to 
every school, in which they were asked to tell of their progress. The paper 
was made attractive by a number of cuts showing the old and new. Some 
information concerning county and State school facts was published. Light 
was thrown on the school system. So successful was that issue that, today, 
the second educational edition will be given to the public. 
The town is always ready to assist the country in bettering its schools, for 
does that not mean more intelligence which brings greater prosperity to all? 
Some ways in which our merchants have helped us—several stoves and cook- 
ing apparatus were given certain schools for the purpose of introducing 
domestic science. Last year the moving picture manager gave to every 
child in the country who made the honor roll, one ticket a month. On teachers’ 
meeting day they ran special educational films. Just now one of the photog- 
raphers in the town is making slides of every school in the county—the good, 
the bad, interior, as well as exterior. These will be shown in the moving pic- 
ture theatres on the day of the county fair. The pictures will tell the tale of 
co-operation and of lack of co-operation, and so cause more co-operation. It 
is not human nature to wish to continue to appear backward. Moving pic- 
tures will be taken at the fair, hence every school wishes to be represented.

PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 339 
The merchants of the town will provide music for the day, and when one gives 
financial support to a movement, real interest is sure to follow. 
The building of a successful county school system is only possible by the 
concentration of co-operation. 
HOW CAN THE TOWN LIBRARY SERVE THE COUNTRY COM- 
MUNITY? 
Miss Mabel C. Williams, Memphis, Tenn. 
A significant feature of the thought of the day is the widespread interest 
in rural life and conditions. 
There seems to be a general impression that something is wrong with the 
country. We read article after article on the various rural problems—the 
rural industrial problem; the rural social problem; the rural school problem 
—each has had and is still having, its due share of attention. This great 
meeting at Louisville in the interest of country life bears witness to these 
facts. 
The farmers do not seem to be unduly alarmed, though they are, to a large 
extent, interested in the improvement of rural matters. 
The farmer is the leader of that large, long-headed, hard-headed, conserva- 
tive class who are, in reality, the backbone of the country. In some respects 
he is the original “‘man from Missouri.’ His point of view may be narrow, 
but he has a point of view. He may not be easily argued out of his position, 
but once convinced he is ready for action. 
It is not the function of this paper to discuss the advantages nor to dwell 
upon the needs of country life; but it is our privilege and our pleasure to sug- 
gest one of the most powerful means of broadening the viewpoint of the farmer, 
and of enriching his own life and the life of each member of his family beyond 
the possibility of bank accounts or fertile fields. 
This means is the library. 
There is no need to discuss the broadening, refining, uplifting influence of 
the right kind of literature. These things are admitted and there are few in 
this age who have not some appreciation of the value of a good book. 
We agree that the rural community beyond all others, needs the library, 
and our question is, how best to meet this need—how to get the books to the 
people. 
Naturally, libraries have been confined largely to cities and towns, and 
until recently the people of rural communities have had little opportunty 
to get a sufficient amount of reading matter of the right kind. 
In the average refined home the library rarely comprises more than a few 
sets of novels, a sprinkling of poetic works and late fiction, with, perhaps 
a set of encyclopedias more than apt to be more than hopelessly out of date. 
To meet this growing need of books in these homes, various plans have been 
tried and some are being carried out with success. Among these means of 
distribution we will call attention to the following: The school library, es-  
-P-A-G-E-344

pecially where State aid is given; the reading circle, such as the Indiana 
Teachers’ Reading Circle, and children’s reading circle; the county library 
system, such as that of Santa Barbara county, Cal.; and the traveling library, 
as carried on in Washington county, Md. 
As to school libraries, there is in some States a law that whatever sum is 
raised by a public school for the purpose of buying books for the school 
library, such sum will be supplemented by an equal amount from the State. 
Thus five dollars becomes ten dollars, twenty, and so on; this incentive has 
led in these States, to great activity along this line. It is no unusual thing 
for a single school entertainment to net $50 or $60. This being doubled by 
the State, a very good little library may be started or substantial additions 
made to the books already on hand. These books are in charge of the teachers 
and are carried into the homes of the pupils at their pleasure. The books are, 
as a rule, bought by the State, being selected from a standard list, while the 
reading matter in a small library is necessarily of a class to suit the capacity 
of the pupils of the various grades. Much of it is real literature, and as the 
library grows, there is an opportunity to broaden and enrich it. In my own 
county, in Tennessee, there is hardly a school that has not at least the begin- 
ning of a library-and the work is steadily progressing. 
The Indiana Reading Circle has been for years a public benefactor; 
the suggestion came up in a meeting of Indiana teachers in December, 1883. 
The Indiana Teachers’ Reading Circle was started and has been in success- 
ful operation ever since. Its board of directors select two books a year, and 
from 12,000 to 14,000 teachers get both of them, which gives a definiteness 
and aim to at least a part of their reading. 
Out of this grew the larger work, the distribution of selected books to the 
school children. In 1887 a children’s reading circle was begun. It has since 
put into the hands of Indiana children more than a million good books. 
Every year twenty books are selected suitable for all the grades of the 
common and high schools; a low price is secured from the publishers, and the 
books are sold to the children and to the schools with only enough added to 
cover the cost of distribution. The circle makes no money. Its labor is for 
the public good. And it has accomplished immeasurable good. The million 
books that the society has sold, have awakened and inspired the minds and 
imaginations of thousands upon thousands of country children in Indiana, 
and grown people too; they have led people who never read before, to read 
not only these books but to seek others. These and hundreds of little libraries 
in Indiana that have grown out of the collection of the reading circle’s books. 
There are many schools that look upon the “‘list of twenty’? as much as neces- 
sities as desks, blackboards or text books. The circle’s influence permeates 
the whole State and its fame has gone abroad. 
Not long ago the secretary of the children’s reading circle received a letter 
from a teacher in Havana, asking how to organize such a circle, and at the 
same time a similar letter from Alaska, and a third from the city of Mexico. 
There are many places nearer Indiana where a children’s reading circle would 
help to enlighten the coming generation and add to its pleasure and power. 
The State of California has a splendid system of free county libraries. 
By an act passed by the California Legislature in 1909, County Supervisors
-P-A-G-E-345
  
PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 341 
were empowered to enter into contracts with existing public libraries in the 
county to extend the library privileges to all residents of the county. Santa 
Barbara county was the first to take advantage of the privilege, and in July, 
1910, an agreement was made with the trustees of the free library to the city 
of Santa Barbara to establish and maintain branch libraries throughout the 
county. 
The first ten stations were opened in November, 1910, and in a few months 
two others were established. These branch libraries extend all over the 
county, one being in a little hamlet 160 miles from Santa Barbara. 
Each collection of books is varied in subject, covering a wide range and al- 
ways including something on local industry. Service from the central library 
is had once a week, when books specially requested are sent if possible. A 
few new books are added each month to each collection, and once in three 
months books are exchanged from one community to another. 
Within eight months from the establishment of the first branch, nearly 
ten thousand books had been read by county patrons. The work has con- 
tinued to grow. In 1912 twenty-three in the county were being served by 
the county library system and 50,000 books were being circulated among 
appreciative readers. 
The cost is not great considering the great amount of good work done. 
$8,000 was appropriated for the first year’s work for the purchase of books, 
expenses of libraries, etc. This appropriation has increased from time to 
time as the growing demands of the people required. 
This system has solved the problem in California of bringing books to the 
seventy per cent. of her people who had been without any library service 
prior to 1910. 
Nearly every State in the Union has some sort of traveling libraries main- 
tained either by the State or some organization such as the Federation of 
Women’s Clubs, the Grange or other associations interested in the welfare 
of farming communities. 
But library workers have found that traveling libraries are not enough; 
many isolated communities remote from railways not being reached by them. 
To Miss Mary L. Titcomb, librarian of the Washington County Library, 
Hagerstown, Md., belongs the credit and honor of establishing the first book 
wagon for the distribution of books to rural communities. The Washington 
County Library is one of the few libraries of the country that is open to the 
people of the entire county, receiving part of its support from an endowment, 
part from the county, and part from the city where located. 
Miss Titcomb conceived the unique idea of carrying books to the remote 
cabin dwellers who wouldn’t come to the books. Her famous book-wagon, 
a sort of cupboard on wheels, something like an old time New England meat 
peddler’s cart, was a familiar picture to the mountain dwellers. It won its 
way into the hearts of the lonely, ignorant people. They had been too in- 
different, too hard worked to seek the traveling library stations, even though 
these were conveniently placed; but when Miss Titcomb drove up to the very 
doors, even the stubbornest enemies of literature gave in. What that little 
wagon did to brighten isolated homes and to lead young people into better 
paths can hardly be estimated.  
-P-A-G-E-346
  342 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
But the wagon was small, and the horse got tired on the steep road, and it 
took four days to make a round that didn’t begin to take in all the people 
Miss Titcomb wanted to reach. 
Naturally Miss Titeomb wished for a motor instead of the old horse and 
wagon. As usual it took destruction to bring about rebuilding. A train 
ran over the wagon and left nothing but splinters. 
The hope was fulfilled, for the destruction of the wagon paved the way 
for the motor, which now carries volumes from Hagerstown over twenty-four 
routes, which cover Washington county. Its unique mission, and the vital 
part of its work, is to distribute books personally, so to speak, at remote doors. 
For the first six months the circulation amounted to 2,103 volumes. There 
are now over 23,000 volumes within reach of the 30,000 county folk of Wash- 
ington county. Surely this means a wider vision in the next generation. 
In closing one of her annual reports, Miss Titcomb says, ‘Not long ago 
in a distant city in the hills, a concourse of people were gathered together to 
dedicate a new library building. The speaker of the day summed up the func- 
tion of the library in these words: ‘When men lose their narrow minded confi- 
dence that their personal views must be right; when they enlarge the borders of 
their minds for the reception of other men’s ideas; when they recognize the su- 
premacy of truth and take for their motto, ‘“Not authority for truth, but truth 
for authority;’ when they become charitable and tolerant towards their 
neighbors, hospitable to new conceptions, watchful for self-improvement, 
ready to sink their private interests in the common good, then, they become 
the material out of which a great and lasting nation may be built. This is 
the use of books—not to make scholars, but to make citizens; not to make 
bookworms, but to make men; not to increase the pride of learning, but to 
foster that fine humility of spirit which is the first condition to the fulfilment 
of all wholesome ideals of knowledge and power!’ ”’ 
Let us see to it that this high ideal and aim of the public library is ever 
before us. 
HOW THE CLUB MAY HELP. 
Mrs. R. H. Lacey, Franklin, Ky. 
No organization that exists in Kentucky is more rejoiced to have this great 
gathering of educational interests in the South, than the Kentucky Federation 
of Women’s Clubs. 
We feel great pride in the fact that it was due to statistics compiled and 
announced by one of our number, that we found Kentucky’s true standing 
in the scale of illiteracy. We brought this fact to public notice and were 
instrumental in bringing about the educational whirlwind campaign and 
arousing public interest to such an extent that school betterment has been 
the result. 
A realization of conditions, however bad they are, is necessary before they 
can be remedied. 
The Federation carried on the work of organizing school improvement 
 
-P-A-G-E-347
  PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSES 343 
leagues for several years, then together with the promoters of your organiza- 
tion and the State Department of Education, this work has been carried on 
until the present year, in fact it is lamentable that the work is not continued 
to-day, for the organizer scarcely has a day that some call does not come to 
her asking her services. 
The Superintendent of Public Instruction is in hearty sympathy with the 
Federation along this line, and has announced his readiness toward securing 
legislation which will cover an appropriation for making this work permanent. 
Regarding our rural schools, legislation, consolidation and transportation 
will solve the problem. Better teachers could be obtained because they would 
receive higher salaries. 
All school buildings could be made adequate to all needs through improved 
equipment. 
The social center or parent teacher work is the same thing as the school 
improvement league of the rural community, making a gathering place for 
exchange of mutual helpful ideas as well as means of entertainment. 
We have found our law regarding the use of the school house as a community 
plant is inadequate, as it is only applicable to the rural districts and does not 
apply to the small town. 
Home economics, introduced into our Federation hy the Alumnae Club 
of this city, has become so popular that I daresay there has been greater 
attendance at the conferences and demonstrations on this than any other 
department relative to women’s work. 
But it is a mistaken idea to say that cooking and sewing are the only 
branches in which woman needs to be proficient. These are only elementary 
branches. You take for granted that every woman is taught these things 
from the time she plays with her doll to the age when she steps into a home 
of her own. Proficiency in many more lines must be reached. 
A far more difficult problem it is to take the family purse, spending from 
seventy to ninety per cent. of it, and be sure we are not making a mistake in 
choice of clothing, foods, household goods or any of the many other expendi- 
tures where our judgment is called for. It has been said that eighteen per 
cent. goes into the garbage can. 
Man always goes through a course of training (greater or less) for his voca- 
tion, but women as a rule, step out of school into matrimony and home-mak- 
ing with little or no thought of the demands which may be made upon her. 
The club women have been the first to realize this fact, the result has been 
home economics has been introduced into our normal schools and I trust 
that it will not be long until our rural schools will be equipped for this too. 
The canning clubs, the basket weaving or any of these household accom- 
plishments than can be taught through the pleasant spirit of rivalry is a great 
help to the women of our State. 
The definition of a well educated person: ‘(One who knows something of 
everything, and everything of some one thing,” has always stood out as my 
ideal, and our women of to-day almost reach that point. 
The women of our Southland who have taken their homes and applied 
business methods to them are to be congratulated, for it is a difficult problem. 
The Federation is co-operating with the county chautauquas, and the chair-
-P-A-G-E-348
    
344 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
man of each department will be ready to respond when called on for talks on 
her subject. 
The Federation is the woman’s movement in our State. It is not confined 
to any class or condition. Its object is helfpulness and along practical lines, 
making life more worth living. It is the humanitarian movement, not bound 
by any political party or creed, but because we are sisters by nature—we can 
be sisters in truth. 
Our Federation could not better express its position in relation to the pur- 
poses and aims of the Conference, than by quoting the motto of our State, 
“United we stand, divided we fall.”

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Probably most people appreciate that a human 
being in his progress from birth to maturity passes 
through certain ages or epochs, each characterized 
by peculiar tendencies and activities. If one should 
ask a man whose business it is to study human 
nature for practical reasons which of these epochs 
is of the greatest importance, he would undoubtedly 
say the period of the teens. He would probably 
declare that during this period the individual is 
being molded into final form in body and mind, and 
that whatever impressions can be made upon him 
at this time will be likely to be permanent. People 
are beginning to take this view; for during the last 
few years much has been said by observers and in- 
vestigators respecting the chief characteristics of 
this period. All have noted the appearance of new 
interests and activities, and the development of ex- 
treme sensitiveness to various influences which have 
been practically unnoticed up until this time. The 
views of the practical man of affairs and the scien- 
tific student of mental development have been in 
accord with the views of the poets, who never tire 
of describing the freshness and enthusiasm and 
abounding vigor, as well as the excesses and the 
strains and stresses of this age. 
In planning the series on Childhood and Youth, 
it was provided that much attention should be given 
to a practical discussion of the epoch covered sub- 
stantially by the high-school period. The present 
volume is devoted wholly to an exposition of the 
characteristics and needs of the high-school age. 
Professor King has presented in simple, straight- 
forward language most of the more important re-

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
sults of modern investigations regarding the phys- 
ical changes which take place during the early teens, 
and the intellectual and emotional developments 
which occur parallel with the physical changes, or 
follow after them very closely. He has also dis- 
cussed questions pertaining to the development of 
fundamental impulses in both boys and girls, and 
the educational problems which issue therefrom. 
He has considered questions of health and school 
work, and practical matters pertaining to the con- 
servation of the energies of high-school pupils, and 
making their work in the school more efficient than 
it has been in the past. He has introduced a con- 
siderable amount of new and concrete material 
which bears directly upon the every-day life of the 
high-school pupil, in respect alike to his studies and 
to iis conduct within and without the school. He 
has dwelt especially upon the development of the 
self during the teens, and he has shown that in 
effect the individual has a sort of new birth during 
this epoch—the birth of the spirit which is as im- 
portant as the first birth of the body. An apprecia- 
tion of this vital transformation during the teens 
will aid the teacher and the parent to understand 
and deal the more wisely with the boy or the girl 
who is passing rapidly from childhood to maturity. 
There is probably no period in the individual’s 
development when he has so many conflicts with 
adults as during the early teens. When he is chang- 
ing so rapidly in body and mind, his individuality 
suddenly looms up in home and school; and it often 
arouses antagonism in parents and teachers. The 
reading of this volume should help any one charged 
with the training of youth to see what activities of 
either the boy or the girl are normal during this

epoch, and so should be encouraged or at least not 
opposed. On the other hand, there are dangers if 
the individual be let follow his own plans without 
direction from any source. Professor King makes 
this apparent in his discussion of the instability of 
many adolescent boys and girls, and their need of 
wise instruction, which should not be obtrusive or 
offensive, but which should nevertheless be effective. 
The book is designed for students of human na- 
ture and education, and also for those who are 
responsible for the care and culture of boys and 
girls during the period of the teens. It is a book 
of interpretation of phenomena in the first place, 
and one of counsel and guidance in the second place. 
It is written in the spirit of modern science, and 
so is modest and reasonable. It is written also with 
a view to assist the practical trainer of youth, and 
so the discussion centers around those aspects of 
development and of education which are of chief 
interest and importance in the home and in the 
school, M. V. O’SHEA.

   PREFACE 
No period of life has been so celebrated in litera- 
ture as has the period of youth, or adolescence. 
Nor is it a time which has interested only the poet 
and the story writer ; the scientist, also, in his search 
for new fields for investigation finds in youth as 
many problems as he may well desire. ‘There is no 
season in the life of the boy or girl which, to parent 
and teacher, is more interesting and more baffling 
than are these years which we may roughly consider 
as lying between thirteen and twenty. Certainly no 
period of life is more apt to be misunderstood by 
older people than is this; nor is there an age upon 
which, in the name of science, greater extrava- 
gancies of thought and more exaggerated assertions 
have been lavished. 
In fact, so little do we know definitely regarding 
the nature of the changes of boys and girls, as they 
pass through youth, that we may still too easily yield 
to the temptation to make large use of the finely 
wrought phrases of the poet when we think and talk 
of this spring-time of life. However, it is by no 
means certain that the student of adolescence should 
entirely ignore the literary interpretations. For 
while the poet may yield to the impulse to become 
the maker of exaggerated phrases, it is yet possible 
that he has an understanding of the heart of youth 
that the scientist will never get if he sticks to his 
technical descriptions and to his bald tables of sta- 
tistics. 
The purpose of these pages is to lead to a study 
of the period of youth, especially in its school and 
social relationships. While we shall in every case 
hope to present facts, oar method will not be con-

fined to that of abstract science but will make use 
of sympathetic description as well. We shall hope, 
if it may be possible, to picture the real boys and 
girls of the teens and specifically of the high school 
with the direct purpose of determining how school 
work may be more fully adjusted to their needs. 
Modern civilization has not been so successful in 
dealing with the problem of childhood as it has been 
in the extraction of gold from the rocks or in the 
building of battle-ships. Possibly our age is more 
intelligent in regard to its children than the world 
of a century ago was. As to that we can not say. 
We only know that we are not so successful as we 
should be, compared with our advances in other 
lines of endeavor. A superficial interest in child- 
hood is shown in the vast sums spent in education, 
but there is general lack of interest in those finer 
adjustments. of the educational process which are 
absolutely essential to their real efficiency. It is 
much easier to induce the legislature of a farming 
state to appropriate fifteen thousand dollars for the 
study and prevention of hog cholera than to induce 
it to give a single dollar for the study and preven- 
tion of immorality among its boys and girls. Corn 
and hogs, stocks and bonds, seem to loom large in 
the minds of the masses, while the problem of child- 
welfare can take care of itself. We are slow in 
casting off completely the doctrine of laissez-faire, 
the “let-alone-and-it-will-take-care-of-itself” doc- 
trine of the older economists. But less and less can 
the problems of child-welfare be let alone. In fact, 
the policy of neglect has not a single prop to sup- 
port it in the intense life of the modern world. 
And yet the American pyblic is interested in the 
education of its children.: Its interest, however,

finds expression chiefly in certain of the grosser and 
more obvious phases of equipment. Much remains 
to be done along the lines of fine discriminating 
adaptation to the physical, mental and social char- 
acteristics of boy life and girl life. It is the purpose 
of the following pages to point out some of the more 
needful adaptations of this type. The matter has 
been presented, as far as possible, in non-technical 
language. The author has purposely attempted to 
draw largely from general literature in his quota- 
tions rather than.to depend exclusively upon the ob- 
servations of professed psychologists. The result- 
ing treatment may be lacking in the technique of 
the scientist, but it is believed it will be of more 
immediate value to parent and teacher.

CHAPTER I 
WASTE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
ECENT extensions of public education have 
nowhere been more striking than in those 
phases which deal with children in the period of 
puberty and early adolescence. The rapid devel- 
opment of public high schools, and of the various 
types of vocational schools, is a striking proof of 
the concern felt by the country in its citizens-soon- 
to-be. 
However, the vast development of the machinery 
of education has not as yet been accompanied by 
Evidence ofalack a corresponding development of 
of fine adjustment ability to reach all boys and girls 
of this age. And, furthermore, those whom the 
school does reach fail, in large degree, to ad- 
vance far enough in their courses even to enter the 
special courses and special schools which have been 
prepared for them. Could some of this loss be 
prevented by a better understanding of the boys 
and girls themselves? It is the conviction of the 
author that this might very well be. 
The education of boys and girls in their teens 
I

will be effective only in proportion to our accurate 
understanding of their characteristics and their 
needs. 
We shall, in the pages that follow, for con- 
venience and brevity commonly use the term youth 
to designate the years from thirteen to twenty, and 
thus include both the time of puberty and that of 
early adolescence. 
In taking up the study of youth it is important 
first of all to know where the children of this age 
RAE arb the are to be found. On this point 
children intheir © we can speak only roughly. It 
ones is probably true in most localities 
that the larger number of them are not in school 
at all beyond the fourteenth year and many have 
dropped out before that time. Thus, from figures 
published for Philadelphia for 1908, (1)* there 
were on a given date actually in school a little over 
15,500 twelve-year-olds; 14,200 thirteen-year-olds. 
These children were nearly all scattered through 
the eight grades below the high schools. Of 
the fourteen-year-olds, the number dropped to 
8,900, of whom about 1,200 were in high school ; 
of the fifteen-year-olds, there were 4,500 in school, 
of whom about 1,400 were attending high school. 
Of the sixteen-year-olds only 3,100 were in public 
schools—a group barely one-fifth as large as that 
of the twelve-year-olds. While we should not con- 
  
*Figures in parentheses refer to authors cited at the ends 
of the chapters.

FOE ee Ee oy DE Tee RE RE PSE ee TT OR MT eae a 
WASTE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 3 
clude that exactly one-fifth of the fifteen and six- 
teen-year-olds were all of those ages left in school, it 
is safe to say that a large proportion of the sixteen- 
year-olds had actually dropped out. We can infer 
from these figures that, in the middle and crucial 
years of youth, the bulk of the boys and girls are 
not in school and that a large number of those who 
are in school are yet below the high-school grade, 
where they normally belong. Take the fifteen-year- 
old group; all of these should if they had made 
proper progress be ready by that time for high 
school, but out of forty-five hundred who have re- 
mained in school only fourteen hundred have at- 
tained that degree of advancement. These figures 
from Philadelphia are probably fairly typical of 
conditions in all large cities and to a degree of 
smaller cities and towns. (2) They throw into 
clear relief two points, which we ever need to bear 
in mind: the first, that boys and girls in the period 
of youth are by no means all in school; and the 
second, of those in school only a small proportion 
are actually as far advanced in their grades as they, 
should be. 
We are thus at the outset brought face to face 
with the need of just such a study as that which 
"A’chellan ge for we here propose. There is a 
thoughtinthese challenge for thought in the fact 
conpinons that large numbers of boys and 
girls are not in school at all in the crucial years of 
youth and of those who are in school, so many fall
-P-A-G-E-24
  4 THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
short of those grades of work which are ordinarily 
supposed to meet the needs of this period of life. 
In a word, it is evident that our great public edu- 
cation machinery is failing absolutely to reach large 
numbers of children in this most interesting and 
most important period of mental and physical de- 
velopment, for, as we have seen in Philadelphia in 
1908, the large majority, by far, of the pupils be- 
tween twelve and eighteen who were in school at 
all were in the elementary grades rather than in 
the high schools. 
In answer, then, to the question—where are the 
adolescents? (using the term broadly) we can say 
that a large number are not in school at all and, of 
those in school, the great majority do not reach the 
high school, and of those reaching the high school 
from one-half to nine-tenths drop out without 
finishing. 
Many causes, to be sure, cooperate to produce 
this wide distribution through the grades of the 
The result of boys and girls in their teens. A 
ROY CAuRes fairly large number are slow 
mentally and could not under any circumstances 
get through the grades of the public school, as 
those grades are at present laid out. It is possible, 
however, that a part of the failure of the school 
to reach the youth is due to lack of adjustment of 
the school to the peculiar needs of this period. 
This possible lack of adaptation is strikingly sug- 
gested by the rapid rate at which pupils drop out
-P-A-G-E-25
WASTE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 5 
The high school of high school. In a study made 
does not hold in New York City, of one thou- 
its pupils sand high-school pupils it was 
found that one-fourth of those entering did not 
stay longer than one semester; over one-third 
stayed a year or less and one-half did not stay two 
years.(3) Smaller cities would probably make a 
better showing. Thus, in a city of ten thousand in 
Iowa, in the case of a class entering in 1908, about 
one-fourth dropped out by the end of the first year 
and one-third stayed only two years or less. In 
this same city twenty-three successive classes were 
studied with reference to elimination. A total of 
one thousand and forty-two pupils in these classes 
entered high school, and of these four hundred 
ninety-one graduated and five hundred fifty-one 
dropped out before completing the work. Of the 
boys there were four hundred eighty-three, of whom 
fifty-five per cent. dropped out without finishing; 
of the girls there were five hundred fifty-nine, of 
whom nearly fifty-one per cent. were eliminated. 
The following table shows the percentage of 
elimination by years in high school of these five 
hundred fifty-one pupils:

6 THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
The above table shows that the heaviest loss oc- 
curs in the first and second years of the high-school 
course. Studies elsewhere have revealed much the 
same condition of affairs. The suggestion of such 
figures is obvious. If there is lack of adaptation 
either on the part of the pupil or the school, it is 
most acute in the earlier years of the course; eighty- 
one per cent. of the boys and eighty-two per cent. 
of the girls who left, did so during these years. 
For some cause or other these years presented pe- 
culiar difficulties to the pupils in getting settled 
down to the work, The question naturally arises 
as to whether the mental and physical changes 
characteristic of the teens might not have been a 
large factor in preventing these pupils from find- 
ing themselves in the work offered by the high 
school. The chapters which follow will possibly 
answer to some extent this question. 
In the case of the one thousand pupils studied 
in New York City, it can not be urged that the 
Dulness of pupils heavy loss there noted was due 
a minor factor to the fact that large numbers of 
those who entered were mentally dull. On the con- 
trary there is excellent evidence to indicate that 
the pupils who enter high school are in a large de- 
gree those elementary-school pupils who have been 
more than usually successful in their earlier work. 
If the high schools get the better pupils from lower 
grades and then, fail to hold them, there is ground  
-P-A-G-E-27
   WASTE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 7 
for suspicion that the work offered does not make 
a vital appeal to those who enter. 
Since this is the time when educational forces 
may exert their greatest influence in the making of 
Youthaneduca- the individual, and since also it is 
tional opportunity the final opportunity of the 
schools, we have a right to demand the finest pos- 
sible adjustment of the schools to the needs of the 
youth. 
It is encouraging indeed to note the rapid de- 
velopment in the last two decades of all kinds of 
schools, public and private, technical and cultural, 
for the adolescent; it is also encouraging to note 
the largely increasing attendance at such schools. 
But with all current progress there are evidences, 
as we have indicated above, of much lack of nice 
adjustment to the ends in view. 
“Between 1900 and 1910 the number of pupils 
in public high schools in the United States increased 
over seventy-six per cent.; the teachers have in- 
creased in this same period over one hundred per 
cent. The number and value of high-school prop- 
erties has increased proportionately during this 
period, including improvement in the quality and 
quantity of facilities for work in libraries, labora- 
tories, gymnasia”; but for twenty years there has 
been no increase in the percentage of pupils who 
are graduated. Take the country over, probably 
much less than half of those who enter graduate.
-P-A-G-E-28
  
  x is 
8 THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
In tthe larger cities the number of graduates falls 
as low as ten or eleven per cent, of those who enter. 
The fact that so many youths enter the public 
high schools indicates that “some one in control re- 
gards it worth while for these pupils to engage 
upon the work of the secondary schools, though 
they may at the outset expect to do but one or a few 
years of the work. But the fact that approximately 
eighty-eight per cent.* do not complete the course 
indicates that most of those who thought it worth 
while to enter the high schools, for some or many 
reasons do not find it possible or perhaps worth 
while to follow out the course, even if at the out- 
set they intend doing so.” (4) 
Be it far from us in this place to criticize harshly 
our public high schools. We wish rather to show 
The conditionsof as clearly as may be shown the 
greater efficiency directions in which there is yet 
room for improvement. With all current progress, 
then, the degree of efficiency attained is not so high 
as it should be. There is much loss, much wasted 
energy, on the part of both the teachers and pupils. 
How can a higher degree of efficiency be attained? 
Only by a minute study of the nature and operation 
of every factor involved. Thus the character and 
amount of outside social forces playing upon the 
school should be carefully determined and, upon 
  
*That is, approximately twelve per cent. of the enrolment 
of any one-year graduate. If there were no elimination the 
percentage of graduation each year should be about twenty- 
five per cent. of that year’s enrolment.

the basis of such determination, definite remedies 
should be suggested and wisely applied. Likewise 
the teaching and administrative processes of the 
high school should be more carefully adjusted with 
reference to eliminating waste and increasing the 
quantity and quality of the product. And under- 
neath all, as the common factor in every one of 
these problems, is the pupil himself. Every other 
factor in the process must be finally adjusted with 
reference to the needs of the pupil, to the sort of 
physical and psychical being that he is. How do 
his present characteristics and the period of 
development through which he is passing need to 
be taken into account in educating him? It seems 
almost puerile to raise such questions. The com- 
mon-sense answer would certainly be that every 
effort should be made to adjust the machinery of 
the schools with all nicety to the pupil’s physical 
and mental characteristics; not of course for the 
sake of humoring him, or making things easy for 
him, but because nothing can be done wisely except 
on a basis of exact knowledge of that with which 
we have to deal. 
In the pages which follow we shall turn for a 
time from the school problem and center our at- 
tention upon the youth himself. We shall try to 
describe as far as possible the changes, physical and 
mental, which occur at this time. In still later sec- 
tions we shall consider possible adaptations of the 
school to the needs of boys and girls in their teens.

  CHAPTER II 
THE PHYSICAL CHANGES OF THE HIGH-SCHOOL 
YEARS 
UR study of the high-school pupil may prop- 
erly begin with a brief account of certain 
of the physiological changes of the period of youth, 
tues tid aamehtal especially the changes which 
character of the cluster about the development of 
physical changes physical maturity. Those changes 
are, in many respects, the most important of any 
that occur in the individual’s progress from birth 
to manhood and womanhood. At any rate they 
stand out more strikingly, develop with greater 
rapidity and bear a more definite relation to the 
mental life than do any previous phases of bodily 
growth. The intellectual, emotional and moral de- 
velopment of the youth can be fully understood 
only'.as one recognizes that profound physical 
changes are then rapidly taking place, changes 
which carry with them, to a certain extent, a series 
of readjustments in the bodily, as well as in the 
mental, organism. 
These physiological changes are the more impor- 
tant for our study because they occur at the time 
when an increasingly large number of boys and

girls are finishing their grammar-school course, and 
are entering higher schools or else dropping out of 
school altogether. It would not be strange, indeed, 
if the character of the work, even to the extent of 
its success or failure, should be very definitely as- 
sociated with these physiological transformations 
and readjustments. 
Let us first of all see what the changes are as 
over against the phases of childhood development. 
Tie dtowthiac- - Even the most ordinary observer 
celeration of of children has noted how most 
ere | boys and girls suddenly begin to 
grow rapidly somewhere between the ages of 
twelve and fifteen. A youngster in the years pre- 
ceding these has grown so gradually as to excite 
little attention from those who are with him daily. 
He grows to be sure, yet imperceptibly. But, al- 
most all at once, it seems to his parents, he begins 
to shoot up. In spite of a watchful mother his 
sleeves get too short and an awkward length of 
shank appears between his shoe-tops and the bottoms 
of his knee trousers. His movements become 
ungainly. He stumbles about and has great diffi- 
culty in knowing what to do with his hands and 
feet. This awkwardness is less apparent in girls 
than in boys, and the girl’s figure also rounds out 
‘more quickly than does the boy’s. All teachers of 
mixed classes from twelve to fourteen have espe- 
tially good opportunity to see how the girls for a 
time forge ahead of the boys of the same age in
-P-A-G-E-33
   THE PHYSICAL CHANGES 13 
. height and weight. The girls are clearly beginning 
to look like young ladies, while the boys with whom 
they have thus far played on scarcely equal terms 
now seem hopelessly stranded in childhood. (See 
the accompanying illustration.) This year or more 
of manifest physical superiority of the girl, with 
its attendant development of womanly attitudes 
and interests, accounts in part for the tendency of 
many boys in the early teens to be averse to the so- 
ciety of girls. They accuse them of being soft and 
foolish, and they suspect the girls’ whisperings and 
titterings of being laden with unfavorable com- 
ments regarding themselves. It is the beginning 
of the break-up of the familiar easy comradeship 
of childhood and marks a transition to a new and 
more profound interest in one another which is 
soon to appear. 
The maturing of the sex function is, of course, 
central in all these physical changes, and the rapid 
increase in stature is so nearly coincident with the 
change of puberty that it may ordinarily be taken 
as a proof that that change has taken place. In all 
the years from birth through childhood the child’s 
rate. of growth declines, at first very rapidly and 
then more gradually. The increase in height of the 
normal child in its first year of life may be as much 
as fifty or seventy-five per cent. over what it was 
at birth. But the rate declines sharply year by 
year until the ninth for girls and the eleventh for 
boys. At this time of the lowest ebb in growth

the annual increase may be less than three per cent. 
Then there is a somewhat abrupt upward turn in 
the curve, especially of boys, which in two or three 
years reaches a maximum of four or five and even 
six per cent. of gain over the year previous. 
When the records made by many children—say 
several hundred or thousand—are massed and aver-

period of most rapid growth in the case of a given 
child is much shorter, often not more than a single 
year, though of course both before and after this 
most rapid period the child may be growing some- 
what faster than he did before the pubertal ac- 
celeration began. The difference between the mass 
curve and the individual curve is worthy of study, 
and two sets of such curves are here reproduced 
(Figures 1 and 2). The important fact brought to 
light by comparing such curves is the somewhat wide. 
difference among individuals in the time of their 
coming to the pubertal change. Thus, some boys may 
mature as early as thirteen, others at fourteen and 
some as late as sixteen. While then, the curve of 
each individual is abrupt and short, if the curves

of many are put together, they result in a long, 
gradually rising and gradually declining line. It is, 
moreover, not merely the brevity for the individual 
of the period of rapid growth, but the suddenness 
of its rise and decline that is emphasized by these 
records. All in all, they vividly suggest that the 
child is being put to a severe test to accomplish his 
transition to physical maturity. This is a period, 
therefore, which demands a good reserve fund of 
general vitality that it may be successfully and 
easily passed over. 
It should be noted also that it is not merely in 
these pubertal years that girls are slightly in ad- 
Girls slightly in vance of boys in their develop- 
advanceofboys ment. As early as the third or 
fourth year of life, if not earlier, girls are from a 
year to a year and a half ahead of boys of the same 
age in every phase of growth. This has been noted, 
for instance, in the hardening of the bones of the 
skull and in the appearance of the second and per- 
manent set of teeth. It is doubtless true of other 
phases less easily measured. 
The acceleration in stature referred to above is 
only one of many accelerations of this period. 
Other growth Puberty is, in fact, accompanied 
phases by rapid increases in almost every 
other aspect of bodily development. The heart 
maintains about the same ratio to the rest of the 
body that has existed in childhood. The arterial 
system grows “less relatively than the heart,” so

that at adolescence the blood pressure is greatly in- 
creased. The muscles develop faster than any 
other part of the body, resulting in a marked in- 
crease in weight. Figure 3 B presents this accelera-

however, rises higher and stays up longer. Puberty 
with girls is generally accompanied by an increased

gives them very nearly their normal weight as 
adults. 
At this same time, also, occurs an increase of 
lung capacity, more striking in the case of boys 
than of girls (Figure 4), but clearly evident in 
both sexes. Muscular strength as measured by the 
grip of the hand, the lifting power of the arms or 
of the back also increases rapidly at the same time 
(Figure 3 A). Some investigators contend that the 
organs of sense also “undergo characteristic alter- 
ations,” but of this much less is known with cer- 
tainty. (1) 
The gross and easily measured changes referred 
to above point to an intensification of all growth 
Generalintensi- Processes at this period of trans- 
fication of all ition to physical maturity. It is, 
See? in a sense, the flood tide of de- 
velopment. Vital forces acquire a momentum that 
they have not possessed before, and which to some 
extent subsides later, never to be regained. The 
life intensity can be measured at different ages by 
the ratio of those living to those dying at each age. 
If the ratio of the living to those who die is high 
at a given age it indicates a great or a high vitality 
for that age. Doctor Hartwell’s study of the phys- 
ical development of Boston school children shows the 
lowest death rate for girls atthe age.of.twelve and 
for boys at thirteen. At earlier ages, for example 
at eight, one child in one hundred sixty died. At 
seventeen the ratio was about the same, but at the

period just preceding the accelerated bodily devel- 
opment of puberty the ratio of the living was three 
hundred to one (Figure 5). (2)

other changes. If for any reason it is deferred 
these other increases are also deferred. When sex- 
ual maturity comes, they come with it. 
As was suggested on a preceding page, there is 
some difference among children as to the age of 
coming to physiological maturity. 
As every one knows, girls, on the 
whole, mature from a year and a half to two years 
earlier than boys. Climate and race are influences 
which hasten or retard the process for both sexes. 
In the warmer climates maturity comes earlier, 
especially with the dark-skinned races. Among the 
races of the temperate zone the Scandinavians de- 
velop somewhat later than others; the Hebrews 
somewhat earlier. 
Economic and social status likewise exerts a 
definite influence upon the time of puberty. Poor 
Influence ofeco- food, lack of fresh air, insuffi- 
nomic conditions cient clothing, hard work and bad 
hygienic conditions, all probably retard develop- 
ment, while the opposite conditions associated with 
a more comfortable, healthful life hasten the change. 
The average age for this climate is regarded as 
most properly twelve to thirteen for girls and 
thirteen and a half to fourteen and a half for 
boys. But in every large group of children there 
will be found many who vary above and below these 
averages from one to two years.

maturing on each side of this middle point, i. e., 
earlier and later, of one to two years. The con- 
dition shown by this table may be taken as typical 
of American children in this latitude. It is fairly 
well established that children tend to vary more in 
the changes of pubescence than in any other growth 
period, and that the variation is about as illustrated 
in this table. 
In any given community there are, of course, 
many different causes which operate differently on 
Thduence of different children to produce this 
environment variation. Race is one factor, 
and immediate ancestry, or family heredity, is 
another. But more important than these is prob- 
ably the group of environmental influences which 
have played upon the child through the years of 
infancy and later childhood. Ill health and un- 
favorable hygienic conditions are regarded by most 
students as tending to retard pubescence. Boas, 
one of our greatest authorities on the growth of 
children, says: “It has been shown particularly 
that better economic conditions bring about a more 
rapid and also a greater development of the body 
than occurs under less favorable conditions. Among 3 
the poor, the period of diminishing growth which 
precedes adolescence is lengthened and the acceler- 
ation of adolescence sets in later. The whole pe- 
riod of growth is lengthened; but the total amount 
of growth during this longer period is less than 
the amount of growth attained during the shorter
-P-A-G-E-46
Fee Ler eee re ce nm 
24 THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
period of growth of the well-to-do. Therefore, we 
find throughout that a young child which grows 
slowly will continue to grow slowly until the period 
of adolescence sets in. Afterward, the child that 
has grown slowly during the early years of child- 
hood will grow rapidly.” (3) After referring to 
climate and nutrition as possible causes of deferred 
pubescence, Boas continues, “It seems plausible that 
in the bulk of our population the better develop- 
ment of man in modern times is due less to better 
nutrition than to the fact that hygienic con- 
ditions of childhood have improved. . . . . It 
seems plausible that, with the diminution of the 
number of diseases that attack the individual, and 
the consequent elimination of their retarding in- 
fluences, growth suffers less interruption, and that 
the final bulk of the body is increased. The differ- 
ences between social classes are great. . 
The whole group of the poor are, at any given time, 
physiologically younger than the well-to-do.” (3) 
These facts and suppositions suggest the view, 
held by many, that a moderately early development 
Early andlatepu- Of puberty is much more to be

ferred or late development. It is likely, also, that 
an extremely early development is abnormal and 
unfortunate, but there are no definite studies on this 
point. However that may be, if the child comes 
to maturity at the usual or normal time it is thought 
that he will make the change better than if he ma-

tures after the usual time. For one thing, the 
general acceleration in his growth will be spread 
over a longer period. He will not be apt to grow 
so rapidly at any one time, but he will continue at 
it longer and will probably reach a more satisfactory 
physical development than if his pubescence were 
late. The earlier and more prolonged ripening of 
the body does not, therefore, put such a heavy strain, .... . 
on the child’s vital forces as does a later ripening. 
The strain, if there is one, is spread out and more 
easily met. Physicians tell us that girls especially, 
who pass the period with difficulty are those who 
have not accumulated sufficient reserve force in the 
years of childhood or who, at the time of puberty, 
dissipate their strength in unhygienic living. Al- 
though it is a critical time, it is not nature’s plan 
that it should be accompanied by unusual weakness 
or by serious breaks in health. 
It is, as we have pointed out, a time when the vital 
forces are intense. But the overflowing energy is 
Til health all needed for the accomplishment 
not normal of these final physical changes, 
for the maturing of the sex functions, and for the 
rapid growth of bones and muscles. If, however, 
it is diverted from these natural channels, as it may 
be so easily, by an excess of physical work or, as 
is more likely to-day, by excessive social interests, 
parties, clubs, etc., with their attendant interference 
with regular habits of rest and sleep, the child is 
almost sure to suffer for it.

Both parents and teachers are liable to be misled 
by the exuberance of the child’s enthusiasms. He 
But it may frequently gives the impression of 
easily develop being able to stand anything. He 
can endure a great deal, but since the demands of 
his body upon his energy have never been 
greater than now, an excess of energy devoted 
to other things than growth will naturally 
hamper the physical development and a serious 
break in health will often follow. In fact, so 
many observers of school children in this period 
have noted an increased tendency to ill health, espe- 
cially in girls, that it is popularly regarded as a 
weak age. Thus, Doctor Cornell, a school physi- 
cian of Philadelphia, says, “Many animals pass 
through a period of lessened resistance fraught with 
danger of disease and injury. The soft-shelled crab 
and the moulting bird are examples. At these times 
shelter rather than exposure should be sought, but 
the civilized human introduces his adolescent young 
into the high schools, and the factory, endeavoring 
to break down the already weakened vital resistance, 
and to overstimulate the nervous system at the 
period of its greatest irritability.” (4) 
Just how far the years from twelve to fourteen 
are actually years of “weakened vital resistance,” 
Overstimu- as Doctor Cornell expresses it, 
lation easy needs to be much more carefully 
investigated. That they are years when both boys 
and girls need special care and protection is probably
-P-A-G-E-49
THE PHYSICAL CHANGES 27 
true, as we have already stated above. They are 
also doubtless years especially susceptible to over- 
stimulation, and nervous irritation. There are, 
however, eminent authorities who believe that all 
would go well if the vital forces were only conserved 
for growth and not dissipated in an excess of social 
and economic activities or by unhygienic modes of 
life. Doctor Leo Burgerstein, of Vienna, who has 
made careful observations upon the health of both 
sexes in early adolescence, says, “It is a well-known 
fact that the time of that change is not only accom- 
panied by physical troubles but also by a psychical 
depression and retarded interest and fitness for men- 
tal work, and these facts must strike us all the more 
because well developed, healthy girls, under favor- 
able circumstances pass through that process of de- 
velopment which is -a physiological one, without 
difficulty, whereas the above named troubles will 
arise under unfavorable conditions with girls who 
are not completely healthy,” whose ill health can, 
as Doctor Burgerstein goes on to point out, often 
be traced to “injurious influences of school life, such 
as continual sitting in bad conditions as to air and 
light, together with difficult and trying home 
work.” (5) 
We stated on a preceding page that an early and 
more prolonged period of maturing is regarded as 
better than one deferred until the middle teens or 
even later. It was there noted that late matting 
boys and girls undergo a sharper pares of rapid

growth but that they seldom make up completely 
what they have lost, the time being too short for 
them to catch up completely with the more favored 
children who matured earlier and at a more leisurely 
rate. 
Every teacher can think of instances of boys and 
girls who remained “little” long past the time when 
Teachers may ob- their schoolmates of the same age 
serve thesethings had “made their growth.” Fi- 
nally the spurt upward with these children would 
come, but it seldom would last long enough to bring 
them up with the rest. These cases need different 
care from those who are in the same transitional 
stage but younger. The latter should be passing 
through the stage slowly and easily while the be- 
lated child will probably be developing rapidly and 
suffering a much heavier drain upon his all too

So much for the phases of physical growth. These 
form for us, in this study, the background of the 
peaeelsr ae important psychic changes and re- 
physical changes adjustments of adolescence. Just 
ftchon as the physical growth, so easily 
observed, is but the outer mani- 
festation of the child’s attainment of physiological 
or sex matufity, so the psychic changes center about 
the definite development of the sex instinct, which 
is, in one form or another, the common element and 
the central driving power in the development of the 
psychic life, We should not, of course, make the mis-

take of assuming that children of earlier years have 
no interest in problems relating to sex. It has been 
shown by careful studies that even very little chil- 
dren have such interests, that they are, in fact, far 
more sensitive to such matters than most parents 
and teachers suppose. But these early phases do 
not concern us here. Their proper recognition and 
wise treatment are important phases of child wel- 
fare that require an altogether separate discussion 
from that in which we are here engaged. It is not 
until the approach of puberty that these early in- 
terests begin to take shape in the definite reproduc- 
tive instinct with all its associated instincts and 
interests.

CHAPTER IIf 
PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT AND SCHOOL EFFICIENCY 
N our study of the high-school age we have thus 
far confined our attention to certain of the im- 
portant phases of growth in early adolescence. It 
Summary of pre- Was noted that the development 
ceding discussion of physiological maturity at the 
time of puberty is the central fact about which all 
other changes are grouped and in terms of which 
they must be explained. The reader should not 
forget the two main points emphasized in the pre- 
ceding chapter: namely, that the period of puberty 
is a time of general quickening and intensification of 
all phases of bodily development, illustrated in the 
rapid increase in height, weight, lung capacity, mus- 
cular strength and resistance to fatal diseases; and, 
in the second place, that there is a difference be- 
tween an early, or normal, maturity of the body and 
a late development, the former being associated with 
better economic conditions and superior health, 
especially in later childhood. It was pointed out 
that children who mature at the usual time make

the transition more slowly and more easily than 
do those whose maturity is deferred, say, until past 
the middle of the teens. 
Those two points have important bearings on the 
mental development of the young adolescent and

Falatioe ee or failure in his school work. A

these years, and they all suggest that there is a 
definite connection between the transition period 
of puberty and the development of physical ma- 
turity, on the one hand, and school efficiency, as 
measured both by the quality of work and the rate 
of progress through the grades. 
Puberty is, therefore, a critical period in the life 
of every boy and girl. Yet how many teachers 
have more than hazy ideas of its importance? Only 
here and there do we find a discerning man or 
woman who gives it any consideration in the han- 
dling of pupils in the upper grammar and lower 
high-school grades. 
If the school work of most boys and girls con- 
tinued smoothly and without interruption in these

fot pepool ignore the change, but such is not 
the case. We have already pointed out that it is 
the weak point in our school system. While a 
goodly and increasing number of children enter
-P-A-G-E-55
SCHOOL EFFICIENCY 33 
the high schools every year, far too many of them 
stay for only brief periods. 
The loss varies in different parts of the country 
and in differently sized cities and schools, but in 
all cases it is sufficiently large to command the 
serious attention of the supporters of the public 
schools. It has been estimated that one-third of all 
boys who enter the high schools of New York City 
drop out at some time during their first half-year, 
and probably not one in nine of all the boys and 
girls who enter those high schools graduate on time. 
As we have already stated, the loss in the smaller 
high schools, at least in the Middle West, is not so 
great as in the large cities East and West but it 
is large enough even in these smaller schools to 
make us all stop and think. 
The conditions which determine how long a boy 
will stay in school are many. Some of them he 
Many conditions appreciates and others he does 
influence school not. It is quite possible that his 
peepee course may be more largely 
shaped by influences of which he is only dimly 
conscious than by those which he apprehends clearly. 
Hence, the reasons he himself may give for leav- 
ing school, may be only transient and superficial 
reasons, excuses as it were, for a course of action 
he has determined upon but the “why” of which 
he can not clearly state. 
Among the causes determining his success or 
failure in school and his consequent desire to stay

in or drop out, the mental and 
physical changes of these years 
must surely play some part. They will, however, 
have to be included among those influences of which 
the boy himself is quite unaware. 
School failure on the part of so many young 
adolescents certainly suggests a lack of adjustment 
somewhere. The school itself 
may be at fault in maintaining 
improper standards of success, or in offering to the 
boys and girls studies ill-suited to their real needs. 
The elementary schools also may be at fault in 
not training the children sufficiently in habits of 
application and in keen enough interests in mat- 
ters intellectual. The home and society generally 
may also be responsible for permitting the young- 
ster to lead the sort of life he does, so that he 
may come up to the high school with lack of “nerve” 
or lack of that grit which makes him willing to 
work hard. He may see the world in a wrong 
perspective and consequently misapprehend what 
that world is going to require of him when he grows 
up. He may lack wholesome ideals and a sufficiently 
clear conception of his own personal responsibility 
for a successful life. 
Doubtless all the above influences contribute 
something toward shaping the attitude of the boy

the very best of stuff in the youngster and that 
dropping out may be the most suitable thing for 
him to do under the circumstances. This much 
may be true, as things stand at present, but we 
should insist that a better adjustment of forces 
somewhere, or everywhere, along the line might - 
result in his remaining longer in school and in his 
being better trained for an efficient manhood. One 
thing is certain, American schools have been insti- 
tuted to train American youths. In proportion as 
these youths do not go to the schools provided, 
they are not getting the training they are supposed 
to need. Among the various readjustments and 
finer adaptations required by such a situation, there 
is certainly need for a finer adaptation to the phys- 
ical and mental characteristics which the boys and 
girls inevitably bring with them into the higher 
schools. If some of them are inclined to drop 
out, of school after a few months’ trial of its 
work, it will do little good to try to comfort our- 
selves with the thought that their decision is un- 
wise or short-sighted; that they have not remained 
long enough really to appreciate what an advantage 
it may be to them to spend a few more years in 
systematic study. “The hard cold fact remains that 
many of these children do not remain when they 
might just as well do so, and it is our business, 
therefore, to see what we can do in readjusting 
our machinery so as to keep them in training a 
little longer.
-P-A-G-E-58
36 THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
The first and possibly the simplest question sug- 
gested by the facts of the preceding chapter, a 
Physiologicalage question which should be capable 
and elimination of a rather definite answer, is 
that of whether this tendency to drop out of school 
in the upper grammar and lower high-school grades 
is in any way related to physiological age or de- 
gree of physiological maturity. Thus far we do 
not know, in the case of large groups of boys in 
the early teens, whether the leaving of school is 
any more frequent with the mature than with the 
immature; whether the transition stage of puberty 
itself tends to make the youngster dissatisfied with 
the school routine and its studies, and unduly anx- 
ious to try himself out in the world. 
It would be comparatively easy for a superin- 
tendent of a fair-sized city school system to find 
out, in the course of a few years, if there is any 
such relationship, and whatever might be thus de- 
termined would be not only of much scientific inter- 
est but of great practical importance in the ad- 
ministration of the schools. 
It has, indeed, been shown by a few investigators 
that those children who are retarded or late in their

of maturity are ordinarily also retarded men- 
tally and that advancement in the school grades 
is related to progress om the physical side. The 
mature pupil with his greater height, weight and 
muscular strength is superior mentally as well as
-P-A-G-E-59
   SCHOOL EFFICIENCY 37 
physically to his immature classmates. There are, 
of course, exceptions to this general tendency. The 
observing teacher will readily recall large boys, 
who have been in his classes, whose work has 
been inferior to younger, less fully developed boys. 
Some of these cases are real exceptions to the tend- 
ency suggested above, others are probably only 
apparent exceptions. 
It is well to remember, as we said before, that 
there are many separate influences playing upon a 
child of any age which react on his school efficiency. 
His degree of physical development, though impor- 
tant, is only one of many factors that determine 
how he will behave or what he will accomplish. 
Some of the disturbing circumstances which inter- 
fere with the normal progress of the young ado- 
lescent in his school work we shall consider pres- 
ently. For the moment we may confine ourselves 
to the influence of growth itself, as far as inquiries 
into the subject throw any light on the problem. 
While there are no extended studies as to this 
connection of maturity with school attendance, 
Whatinvestiga- there are many indications that 
tions reveal such a relationship does exist and 
that it has an important influence on school suc- 
cess. For instance, in most schools, large or rapidly 
growing boys and girls are usually found in the 
same classes with those who are quite immature, 
that is, with boys and girls who are yet “little 
children.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  38 THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
Thus, in a grammar school known to the writer, 
a seventh grade class contains eighteen little boys, 
fifteen pubescent and four who are mature. The 
physically mature children, especially the boys, are 
very apt to feel awkward and out of place under 
these conditions. They do not have much in com- 
mon with those who are less well developed than 
themselves, even though they may be of the same 
age in years. 
With the above fact in mind, an experiment was 
recently made in a New York City boys’ high 
A New York school. The object was to see 
experiment whether boys of the same degree 
of development did any better work when grouped 
together than when mixed with younger and older 
boys. The entering class was divided into sections 
according to the degree of maturity of its mem- 
bers. Two hundred ninety-five boys were thus 
divided into several sections according to their 
degree of physiological development. At the 
end of six months it was found that about 
twenty per cent. of all these boys had left 
school and twenty per cent. more had failed in one 
or more of their studies while sixty per cent. were 
ready for promotion. These discharges, failures 
and promotions were scattered unevenly and in no 
apparent order through all ages from fourteen to 
seventeen, and through all the various degrees of 
maturity. These percentages of failure seem high 
when taken by themselves, but fortunately we are
-P-A-G-E-61
SCHOOL EFFICIENCY 39 | 
able to compare them with the record of another 
group of one hundred forty-nine boys of the same 
degrees of maturity, who entered the same high 
school at the same time, a group who were prob- 
ably not in any respect different in ability from 
the first group of two hundred ninety-five. 
The members of this second group were divided 
into sections, not according to physiological age, 
but according to the elementary schools from 
which the different boys came. Of this group, 
thirty-one per cent. dropped out before the end 
of six months, seventeen per cent. failed and 
fifty-two per cent. were promoted. The record 
of a previous class of three hundred eighteen 
boys, in which there was also no attempt 
to classify according to maturity, was also exam- 
ined, and in this class it was found that there had 
been a loss, in six months, of twenty-seven per 
cent., failures seventeen per cent. and promotions 
fifty-six per cent. As Doctor Foster, who made 
the study, says, “The group of boys classified ac- 
cording to physiological age had a higher percentage 
of promotions and a very much lower percentage 
of discharges. The failures in the two groups were 
about the same,” at least they were so nearly alike 
that no conclusions, one way or the other, could 
be drawn from them. “The marked difference 
seems to be in the matter of discharges. May 
this difference not be due to the grouping of the 
boys of the same development making the work
-P-A-G-E-62
  40 THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
so much more enjoyable that they did not have the 
same inclination to leave school?’(1) Here is 
surely a point that every serious teacher must con- 
sider. Putting together children of the same physi- 
ological age is apparently a factor in keeping them 
in school. 
In the investigation just described it will be 
noted, however, that the mature boys did not seem 
to do their school work any bet- 
Eocene ter than the less developed ones. 
citer eT Possible causes of this we shall 
consider later. There is evidence, 
nevertheless, that maturity does have a favorable 
effect on scholarship. In certain schools it has been 
found, for instance, that a considerably higher per- 
centage of boys who have passed the pubescent 
stage at thirteen, at fourteen and at fifteen years 
are promoted in their work than of those boys of 
these ages who have not yet matured. Of first year 
high-school boys observed by Doctor Crampton in 
New York City, eighteen per cent. of the mature 
and twenty-seven per cent. of the immature failed 
to pass at thirteen; at fourteen the difference was 
twenty-four per cent. and thirty-four per cent. in 
favor of the mature, and so on for the succeeding 
years. This school physician, therefore, makes the 
general statement that, the more advanced high- 
school boys are in pubescence, other things being 
equal, the better their scholarship. (2) 
Commenting on such facts as have been men-

tioned above, Doctor Crampton says: “The great 
Doctor Cramp- failure of education to-day is its 
ton’s comment inability to recognize the fact 
(where it is absolutely essential that it should) 
that children differ in rapidity of development. Its 
maladjustments are particularly evident at or about 
the time of puberty. The change from an asexual 
to a sexual life may occur at any age from six 
to twenty years, usually between twelve and fifteen, 
but when it does occur the changes are profound. 
In the short space of six months the child becomes 
a man or a woman, and the transition is fraught 
with the dangers and turmoil of a new birth. There 
is an outburst of physical growth, four or five inches 
are added to height, thirty or forty pounds to 
weight, and strength may be doubled in a short 
space of time. New mental abilities appear, while 
others disappear, the type of play changes, new 
companions are sought, new likings, tendencies, en- 
thusiasms and emotions make up the whole life. 
Old landmarks of life fade and new ones are eagerly 
sought. 
“The sexual ripening determines an entirely new 
outlook upon life, the earning instinct looms large 
in the boy, and the home-making instinct in the 
girl. 
“The important fact that is constantly disregarded 
is the fact that the pubertal change leaves the child

just left behind... . 
“Sitting alongside of each other, receiving the 
same teaching, subject to the same regulations and 
discipline, are children three or more years past 
puberty, and others three or more years lacking 
before the change will occur. The result is a chaos. 
No one course of study can be fitted to their dis- 
parate needs, and no one form of discipline can be 
enforced with each group with equal success.” (3) 
Maturity, however, as we said above, is only one 
factor, even though an important one, in determin-

anew mental The bad showing in their studies outlook often made by the larger, more 
mature boys, is probably not caused by the fact 
of their maturity but by other conditions, which 
are liable to develop in the boys’ lives within and 
without the school. The change in the mental out- 
look which always comes with maturity may make 
them restive and dissatisfied with the school routine 
and school tasks, They become not less able men- 
tally but less willing to devote themselves to their 
lessons. There are manifold distractions to which 
they have become more or less keenly sensitive, 
distractions of social life or of athletics, the dis- 
tractions due to opportunities to go to work, and 
to the desire to do “bigger things.” All these 
interests serve to turn their attention away from
-P-A-G-E-65
SCHOOL EFFICIENCY 43 
their school work. Their dissatisfaction is apt to 
be intensified if they find themselves in classes with 
“Jittle” boys even though the latter may be as old 
in years as they are themselves. 
Then again, an over-age, mature boy, say of 
sixteen or seventeen, in a first year high-school 
Metureboye ta class, may be naturally dull, or 
thelower grades he may be backward because of 
usually dull irregular school attendance in the 
lower grades. He is, therefore, probably poorly 
equipped to compete with the smaller boys in his 
class who may be naturally brighter than he and 
who have been more regular in attending school, 
and this also will tend to make him restless and 
may lead to his early dropping out. 
On the other hand, the little boy in the grammar 
grades, while he is not possessed of the wider men- 
tal outlook on life of his larger 
classmates may be natively 
brighter. In any case he is not so susceptible to 
the distractions that interrupt the work of these 
larger boys and he will, for the time being, tend 
to be a better student than they. These reasons 
alone would be sufficient to account for the larger 
number of promotions that may frequently be noted 
among the smaller and less mature boys and girls 
in grammar school. The situation is, of course, 
different in high school.

vations on girls have any similar data for girls; 
but it is fair to assume that such studies of girls, 
when they are made, will show much the same 
tendencies, except that the contrast between the 
immature and the mature girl is possibly not so 
great as the contrast between the immature and 
the mature boy. Such an assumption would be 
based in part on the fact that girls of different 
degrees of maturity do not usually show such strik- 
ing contrasts in Biya growth as do boys and, 
furthermore, that girls, in their early teens, are 
usually subject to fewer disturbing outside influences 
than are boys. Their lives are lived more com- 
pletely inside the home and the school. They usu- 
ally submit more willingly to the routine of school 
tasks, The adventurous, roving spirit, which in 
boys seeks an outlet in athletic and gang activities, 
appears to be less intense in most girls. At any 
rate, the high schools generally lose a smaller per- 
centage of girls than of boys. While entering 
classes are quite evenly divided between the sexes, 
there are always many more girls than boys who 
stay to the end of the course. Many girls, to be 
sure, must stop to go to work, but larger numbers 
of girls than boys see in the high-school course 
a preparation for a future vocation, such as teach- 
ing, nursing, domestic science and clerical positions. 
It is also well i that girls, on the whole, make

slightly better grades in their studies than do boys. 
Thus, it was found from a study of the grades 
made in one medium-sized high school in the Mid- 
i dle West, of two hundred seven- Girls often do better school work teen boys and two hundred seven- 
than boys ty-four girls in twenty-three suc- 
cessive classes covering a period of eleven and a 
half years, that the boys made seven thousand two 
hundred seventy-three passing grades and the girls 
nine thousand two hundred one. These groups in- 
cluded only those who actually finished the work 
and were graduated. The girls, as a whole, thus 
stood slightly higher than the boys in passing grades. 
But the difference is more marked when those of 
each sex are selected who did not make a single 
failure. Of such who had perfectly good records 
it was found that there were only eighty-seven boys 
as against one hundred twenty-eight girls. 
This slight superiority of the girls over the boys 
is doubtless connected, in part, with the girls’ more 
early maturity. Since most girls Superiority due foiginie niore teach this period from a year and 
fatale a half to two years earlier than 
boys, say between eleven and thir- 
teen, it follows that first year high-school girls, 
as a rule, show a higher percentage of mature 
individuals than is to be found among first year 
high-school boys.* If it is true that there is a 
relation between maturity and mental ability it

would, therefore, be expected that high-school girls 
would, as a whole, be better able to grapple with 
their studies than would the boys. This fact of 
earlier maturity and more advanced mental outlook 
of girls has important bearings on the question of 
coeducation in these years. This matter, however, 
will be considered by itself in a later chapter.

Maturity and grammar-school boys and girls 
schoolabilityina ranging in age from ten and a 
grammar school = aif to seventeen years. The re- 
sults, although based upon the records of pupils 
below the high school are significant in this study 
of the high-school pupil because the question of the 
relation of maturity to school work is in part the 
same regardless of the school the child may be 
attending. Moreover, our problem at this point 
is in regard to pupils of a certain age rather than 
of a certain school grade. We must begin by 
trying to understand the age itself irrespective of 
grades. These children were first grouped accord- 
ing to half years of age and each half-year group 
was further divided according to degree of maturity 
or physiological age. 
The table given on page twenty-two shows the dis- 
tribution of these children. This table reveals at a

face. Children of the same age present different 
degrees of physiological development. Take those 
who are between twelve and a half and thirteen 
years of age. From the table (page twenty-two) 
we see that of the sixteen boys in this group, 
thirteen are still “little boys,” that is, they have 
not yet arrived at the stage of maturing, while 
three are in that stage already. Five of the girls 
of this same group are yet immature; twelve are 
maturing, and two are mature. The girls are, as 
we should expect, further developed physically than 
are the boys. 
The difference in appearance of children of the 
same age in years but of unequal maturity is vividly 
suggested by the photographs of Differences in L L :

ing to age in years. The picture shows the ex- 
tremes of development which may be found in any 
school among children of the same age. One of 
the boys of each pair is manifestly still immature, 
all three of them are clearly still “little boys.” Of 
the other three boys, the two larger ones to the 
left may be fairly judged as maturing. They are 
in their period of rapid growth. The lack of poise, 
characteristic of this period, is especially evident 
in the awkward position of one of them. The

evidence of a different stage of development. The 
large fellow of the pair to the right is still fur- 
ther advanced in physical maturity. He has every 
appearance of a mature or a postpubescent boy. 
The little fellow by his side is, for some reason, 
late or retarded in his development. Although of 
the same age in years, his outlook on life and his 
interests are essentially different from those of his 
companion. The great difference in development 
often seen in girls of the same ages is brought 
out by the accompanying illustration. 
It was noted in examining the above table

We may be practically sure, from 
what we know in general about the variation among 
individuals in reaching pubescence that some of 
the boys in this group of thirteen were just at 
the point of entering that stage, while some of them 
would probably not reach it for a year and still 
others might not reach it for two or even three 
years. Extended studies on the effect of early and 
late development of maturity would lead us to 
expect to find that the boys in this twelve-and- 
a-half to thirteen-year-old group who would not 
become pubescent till fifteen or sixteen were at the 
time of this study less well developed mentally 
than their schoolmates who were just ready for 
puberty.

in this half-year we can determine roughly the 
Ofsas citar Cen extent to which they were alike 
in mentality or unlike in mental ability. Such 
peas a study of their grades shows that 
seven of them are classed by their teachers as good 
students while the remainder (six) are doing in- 
ferior work. What the actual future development 
of these boys may be, we can only know with 
certainty after it has occurred, but on the basis of 
studies made by other investigators it would not 
be surprising to find these boys of inferior scholar- 
ship relatively late in attaining their full physical 
development. 
The point of importance emphasized in the pre- 
ceding paragraphs is, then, this: Groups of chil- 
dren of the same age, especially between the years 
of twelve and sixteen, are far from homogeneous. 
Individual differences in physical and mental de- 
velopment which are more or less apparent at all 
ages, are now especially noticeable in these years 
and call for a correspondingly nice adjustment of 
conditions that these children may profit as fully 
as possible by their school work. 
Certain other interesting points came out of the 
study of the grades and classes of these two hun- 
dred seventy-two pupils; points which throw some 
light on the relation between physiological age and 
mental ability. They are suggestions of relation- 
ships which, as far as they go, are significant,

but which of course need to be confirmed by fur- 
ther and more elaborate studies before they can 
be regarded as established facts. 
These are some of the points referred to above. 
Taking all the clearly immature children together, 
and likewise all the maturing School grades atthe ditecent and the mature, it was found that 
physiological the first, or immature group, made age groups more good grades than did the 
second, or physiologically older group, and that the 
second group did better work as a whole than the 
third group of fully mature boys and girls, and 
also that the girls in every group made better show- 
ings than the boys. The figures are as follows:

Doubtless the reader’s first thought will be that 
these figures contradict earlier statements in this

each of these three groups is divided into two sec- 
tions, putting together in the first all who appear to 
be developing at the normal rate and in the sec- 
ond all who appear retarded or slow in their devel- 
 
-P-A-G-E-78

opment we get somewhat different results. These 
are shown in Table IV. 
TABLE IV 
RELATION OF GOOD AND POOR GRADES IN THE YOUNGER AND 
OLDER AGE GROUPS

22 Immature boys of over 13% yrs.......... 56% good grades.

34 Matured girls of 15 yrs. or younger . 60% good grades. 
8 Matured girls over 15 yrs........ . 40% good grades.   
   
As far as the above data go, it appears that the 
children of early or normal development in every 
N case do better than those who are ormal develop- ; 
ment better somewhat later, if not retarded, 
Go eG in their development. It seems, 
therefore, that the poor showing of the pubescent 
and postpubescent groups given in Table III is due 
to the grouping together of those who are early 
and normal with those who are late and perhaps 
retarded in physical development. 
But even Table IV does not show the actual re- 
lation of physiological age to school standing as 
Evidenceinthe  2¢curately as it may be deter-

grees of development who are of the same age in 
years. For instance, in the group of girls who are 
between twelve and a half and thirteen years, there 
are cases of all three physiological ages and those 
who are further developed make better grades than 
those who are less advanced in their development. 
This is the showing: 
Immature girls of 1214-13 made 56% good grades. 
Maturing and mature girls of 1214-13 made 69% 
good grades. 
Similarly for the next half-year: 
Immature girls of 13-1314 years made 60% good 
grades. | 
Maturing and mature girls of 13-1314 years made | 
80% good grades, 
Of the boys who are between 14 and 14%: 
The immature made 53% good grades. 
The maturing and mature made 72% good grades.   
While the number of cases is too small to furnish 
conclusive evidence, it points, in general, to this 
conclusion: The children of advanced development 
in these years are superior in scholarship to those 
who are less fully developed. 
It was also found in this group of children that 
of forty-three maturing boys between the ages of

Of fifty-one maturing girls between twelve and 
fourteen and a half over eighty-four per cent. were 
found in the three advanced classes as against six- 
teen per cent. in the three lower classes. This is 
shown graphically in the following figure (6).

It would not be safe to make sweeping gener- 
alizations from this study. It needs to be extended 
c ies over a longer period and similar ‘onclusion in : ; 
accord with other studies should be made in other 
Sea eenare schools. But, as far as it goes, 
the study seems to indicate a superiority of the 
maturing or mature child over the immature be- 
tween the ages of twelve and fourteen and a half. 
Inferior work seems to be associated with late ma- 
turity. The results here presented are in accord 
with Doctor Crampton’s generalization which was 
based on an accurate study of four thousand eight 
hundred high-school boys. He says, “Earlier 
pubescence favors good scholarship, later pubes- 
cence, poorer scholarship. This should be taken 
into consideration by all who have the care of the 
pubescent.” (1) 
As he further points out, if we take any group 
of boys in high school at the same age, say four- 
teen to fourteen and a half, we shall find that they 
are scattered through several grades. Some will 
be in the first term; others in the second and so on 
up to even the fifth or sixth. That is, boys in the 
first half of the fourteenth year will be found all 
the way from the beginning of the high-school 
course well into the third year’s work. Now the 
significant thing is that those pupils of this age 
who are farther along in their grades are on the 
whole the ones who are also further developed phys- 
ically. For example, it has been found that of the  
-P-A-G-E-82
  
Hee eee i rh

56 THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
fourteen-year-old boys who are in the first half- 
year of the high school, only fifty-seven per cent. 
are mature, while of the boys of the same age in 
years but in the fourth and fifth half-year’s work, 
over eighty-three per cent. are mature. These ob- 
servations clearly show that, age for age, the ma- 
ture have the advantage over the immature in their 
rate of school advancement. In general, Crampton 
finds that fifty per cent. more of the immature boys 
in high school fail, than do of the mature. 
Not many observers have taken into account the 
physiological age when they have attempted to 
Smedley’s findings Measure the ability of children 
in Chicago in their early teens. Smedley’s 
studies on small groups of Chicago public-school 
children some years ago, while they neglected this 
important factor, showed nevertheless that the 
larger and stronger pupils were better in memory 
tests and further advanced as to class standing than 
the smaller and weaker pupils of the same age. It 
is probable that in the case of the pupils in the 
early teens that physiological age was the determin- 
ing factor. 
Interesting evidence as to the relation between 
physical and mental development comes also from 
the study of mentally defective children. 
Doctor Henry Goddard, who has made extensive 
measurements of the height of defectives, found 
that for every age such were below the average of 
the mentally sound and that the difference was
-P-A-G-E-83
    A CONCRETE CASE 87 
greatest from twelve years on. While we must 
not, of course, conclude that the mental inability of 
: such children is caused by re- 
aeoes a Y tarded or imperfect physical 
velopment of the rowth, those observations help 
oo i establish the relationship which 
we have suggested as existing between all sides of 
mental and physical development. At the age when 
the normal child is forging ahead most rapidly, 
when he is experiencing an intensification of alt 
processes of life, the defective child is dropping be- 
hind all the more rapidly. His mental inferiority is 
the more strikingly indicated by the failure of his 
body to maintain the rate of advance which it has 
seemed to establish in childhood. Thus, without here 
entering into the causes of low mentality, we can 
at least point to the striking and widening differ- 
ence between the normal and the defective in these 
adolescent years in the matter of physical growth, 
as one of the evidences that mental and physical” 
well-being go hand in hand. The defective child is 
not only unable to accomplish the usual physiolog- 
ical acceleration in these years, he rather reveals 
his inferiority by still further falling behind the 
youth of normal endowment. 
Referring again to the apparent exceptions to 
the principle above stated, namely that physiolog- 
Irioseia tive boy i ical maturity favors good school 
grammar school work, the reader should bear in 
eutotpiace mind the following possibilities
-P-A-G-E-84
  58 THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
and limitations: Mature boys in the grammar 
grades are nearly always over-age and hence dull 
or slow fellows. If they had been of normal 
mental ability they would ordinarily, if in school 
at all, have been in the high school rather than in 
these lower grades. 
It is in the high school that we find the clearest 
relation between maturity and mental ability. Here 
4 the “big boy” is where he should 
High seeool re eth- be and does better than the “little 
adaptedtodegree boy,” as Doctor Crampton has of maturity : 
pointed out. The cases of poorer 
work in this type. of boys in high school must 
usually be interpreted as due to lack of interest in 
the school tasks and to too much attention to out- 
side activities. It is, in fact, quite likely that the 
methods of too many of our schools are better 
adapted to the minds and interests of little chil- 
dren than they are to the needs of pubescent and 
mature boys and girls. This is inevitable where 
large numbers of little children are in the same 
classes with the larger ones, as is practically always 
the case in the upper grammar and lower high- 
school grades. The teacher unconsciously adapts 
herself to the level of the smaller and physiolog- 
ically younger children. They are more docile and 
receptive than their more fully developed class- 
mates. The latter are less willing to be led; the 
command of the teacher to do a task is no longer 
a sufficient incentive and unless they can see some

F 
A CONCRETE CASE 59 
further reason for doing the work, some way in 
which the work fits into and satisfies some personal 
aim or interest, they are not likely to pursue their 
work in school with much enthusiasm. They are 
just coming into the age when it is natural for the 
normal children to wish to plan and do things for 
themselves and if the school does not afford oppor- 
tunity to develop such impulses they will find satis- 
faction in various ways outside of school and to 
the detriment of school work. 
Much has been written and still more said of 
the danger of imposing too much work, either 
mental or physical, upon the boy May the matur- Rea s 3 ; ing scholar be or the girl in this transition period overworked? of life. It is evident that the 
period involves a severe strain on the youth’s phys- 
ical resources and that he should not under the circumstances be overtaxed. If the transition comes 
sufficiently early, however, and is preceded by a Proper accumulation of vital force through a hy- gienic and easy childhood there seems to be no good 
reason why he may not continue his school work 
with increasing rather than diminishing efficiency. 
He is, it is true, in a state of unstable equilibrium 
and needs to be dealt with tactfully. He may easily 
be upset and his development disarranged if he is subjected to the wrong sort of influences; if, for instance, his parents or teachers nag him about little things, or if his emotional surroundings are 
more or less exaggerated. What he needs, above

oO all, is calmness, sympathy, freedom from intense 
excitement of any kind. He is apt to be a ver- 
itable powder magazine of emotions, and if these 
are, papal unwise treatment, allowed to explode 
they can spell only disaster, sometimes temporary 
and sometimes permanent. The children who 
suffer most from overstrain in early adolescence or 
who seem to suffer much mental retardation, are 
probably those, i a who either come into it with- 
out sufficient reserve force or those who are devel- 
oping later than usual so that they must expend an 
abnormally large amount of energy in their com- 
paratively short period of rapid growth. As Boas 
says, the crowding of mental and physical devel- 
opment into a short space places a considerable 
burden on both body and mind. 
In all our work with boys and girls, we must 
distinguish between their capacity to do and what 
Dikerence between they really should do. Children 
whattheycando of three years, for example, can 
iceecg\ iam and have been taught to read, but 
it is very doubtful whether the wear and tear in- 
volved in this process is not greater than the gain; 
whether the growing eyes are not subjected to an 
undue strain; whether the close attention involved 
in aT id of the printed symbols is not cul- 
tivated at the expense of activities and interests 
which would be far more productive of mental 
growth. 
The same is true of the period of puberty. The

mere fact that the boy and girl can make excellent 
Should be free grades in their school tasks is not 
from worry; to be taken to mean that they 
normal motives should be pressed or even bur- 
dened with heavy work at this time. Children are 
now consuming a large amount of energy in grow- 
ing. Many of them are going through an intensi- 
fication of mental and physical processes, but these 
processes are not sufficiently well established to be 
in perfect equilibrium. It is for this reason that 
the youth should not be subjected to pressure. He 
can not afford to worry over his work. Under 
normal circumstances he ought to be able to get 
along in school effectively ; but his own inclinations 
should, to a certain extent, be followed as to 
whether he should do more or not. We should be 
sure, however, that his desire to do extra work is 
not brought on him by the pressure of parents or 
by his own desire to make certain grades or to 
win honors of any sort. If these motives appeal 
to him, as they easily may to certain temperaments, 
he should be shielded from them. 
What both sexes need more than all else is free- 
dom to perfect the physical changes that are in

things are the best of means for warding off mor- 
bidness in thinking or any undue dreaminess. There

is no special seallle why the normal youth may not

physical weakness But physicians and discerning 
Sometimesnoted teachers unite in saying that this 
tendency to physical breakdown is due to an unwise 
ordering of life outside of school. The actual 
school studies do not make heavy demands on the 
pupils. While a few put in an excessive amount 
of time studying outside of regular school hours, 
sitting up late at night to get their lessons, this can 
hardly be said of the average high-school pupil of 
to-day. An investigation of the study habits of 
nearly twelve hundred high-school pupils in three 
different high schools of varying sizes in Iowa, 
brought to light the fact that comparatively little 
studying was done at home.

It will be seen that the most common amount of 
time devoted to study outside of school by these

pupils is five to eight hours the week—certainly 
not an excessive amount. 
As far as these figures go they seem to support 
the contention of teachers that it is not the school 
work, as such, but the outside activities which cause 
the heavy drain on the pupil’s resources. 
Of these outside activities those of a social and 
recreational nature are responsible for more trouble 
Complexity of than home work of any sort. Our 
modern life modern life is becoming far too 
complex for the good of the boys and girls. More 
and more are the social activities proper for adults 
indulged in by children in their early teens. Parties, 
receptions and dances of the grown-up type, with 
late hours and excessive finery, occupy far more 
of the attention of high-school pupils to-day than 
they did fifteen or twenty years ago. Undue in- 
dulgence in social matters is particularly hard to 
control in the case of children of this age. They 
seem unable of themselves to appreciate the need 
of a proper balance in what they do. It is a period 
of intensity devoid of the restraints that at a later 
period will produce a degree of moderation. Chil- 
dren now feel unusually important and entirely able 
to judge for themselves what they should do or 
refrain from doing. They rebel at restrictions of 
teachers and parents and seek ways to slip past 
them. Teachers and parents need now, of all times, 
to work together to secure a proper control over :

the children, a bes that will not be repressive 
but will seek to secure a wholesome distribution of 
their energies and a well balanced growth, 
Unless there is mutual understanding and co- 
operation between the school and the home the ef- 
c ‘ forts of each will be apt to be ‘cooperation S y J 
of school and quite futile. Many well inten- 
home esoqte tioned, sensible parents are com- 
pletely swept off their feet by the inordinate and 
foolish demands of their boys and girls for expen- 
sive clothes. The girl tells her mother that her 
classmates wear different dresses and different 
shoes every day. She simply must do as they do or 
be left out of everything or constantly snubbed 
as only high-school girls know how to snub. The 
mother is at her wits’ end. She knows the family 
finances can scarcely be stretched to meet such a 
demand, but what can she do? She does not wish 
her girl to be different from the others, to be con- 
sidered queer, and so she weakly submits. Very 
likely almost every other mother who sends a 
daughter to the school feels as she does but, all 
alike, they are helpless. The teachers, also, doubt- 
less deplore the extravagant dresses and habits of 
the pupils. But they can of themselves do nothing. 
If all could get together and discuss the common 
problem with its attendant dangers for the pupils, 
it would be a long step toward working out a policy 
of common sense, a policy undoubtedly connected

  CHAPTER V 
THE MENTAL CHANGES OF THE TEENS; THE EARLIER 
YEARS 
HEN any period of life is set off for special 
study there is danger of drawing a picture 
that is exaggerated and untrue to reality. This is 
The illusion of especially the case with both 
distinct periods = childhood and youth. In our 
eagerness to state clearly the traits of the period 
with which we are concerned, we tend to draw 
lines of definite separation between what has come 
before and what comes after. This indeed has been 
a vice of all those who take up any part of a series 
of changes for particular study. The geologist at 
first blocked off the history of the world into 
definite periods. There was, for example, the Silu- 
rian, the Devonian, the Carboniferous, each clearly 
separable from what preceded and from what fol- 
lowed. But the later geologists have come to see 
that there is no such clear demarcation of periods. 
Each stage in the history of the earth gradually 
merges into the one next to it by a multitude of 
transition periods. The same tendency may be 
noted in the study of the history of religion, or of 
industry or of any human institution. Here again, 
66 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  CHANGES IN THE TEENS 67 
at first, stages were set off; for example, men were 
said in the beginning to be worshipers of fetishes, 
then they made gods out of great natural objects, 
as the sun or the ocean and, by a succession of 
steps, arrived at the worship of a single God who 
loved mercy rather than sacrifice. But here also 
the idea of separate periods and of definite se- 
quences has been proved to be an illusion. Here, 
as elsewhere, there is only a continuous process of 
change and definite lines of separation can not be 
drawn in one place any more legitimately than in 
another. 
In just this same way the so-called»periods of 
life from birth to maturity exist largely in the mind 
Development a of the over-eager observer. The 
continuous process more we know about human 
nature, the more are we convinced that development 
is a continuous process. The child is, it is true, 
different from the youth, and the youth from the 
man, but these differences have come about through 
‘infinitely minute gradations rather than by great 
leaps. Much has been made, for instance, of the 
difference between the religion of the child and of 
the youth, and yet everything to be found in the 
moral and religious point of view of the youth had 
its beginnings and its incubation in childhood. 
There is no abrupt shift from one to the other. 
This does not mean, oft course, that no time of 
life has any striking or distinctive characteristics. 
We are striving rather to emphasize the fact that
-P-A-G-E-96
       | | 
; 
68 THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
what we always find, when we look carefully, is 
continuity in development rather than abrupt trans- 
ition. | 
Even on the physical side of child development, 
this is perfectly true. The time of rapid growth, 
Situatratedi ta at the period of puberty does not 
physical growth = normally begin suddenly nor does 
it end all at once. Even though : actual rise in 
the curves of height and weight occur with seeming 
abruptness, the child has, in the years previous, been 
getting ready for this accelerated development. He 
has been laying by a reserve of energy, as is evi- 
dent from the fact that when he has not lived as a 
child should, having his due share of nourishing 
food and of play and of sleep, when he has been 
shut up in unhealthful quarters and has had to 
work beyond his strength, he is a t to fail to de- 
velop as rapidly as most children do in the early 
teens. His pubertal development is, as we have 
seen, deferred and may be relatively abrupt. 
In fact, wherever there are sudden and funda- 
mental changes there is every reason for believing 
that they are abnormal, due to unnatural condi- 
tions of some sort which have blocked the normal 
development and outgo of energy at its appropriate 
season. Just as the course of a river may be 
blocked by a dam until it rises sufficiently, when it 
rushes on with a roar and continues in its way. 
The development of the sex Tinee at puberty 
is no exception to this rule. The manifestations 
Wt
-P-A-G-E-97
CHANGES IN THE TEENS 69 
of this impulse at that time are In the develop- ae 
ment of the usually so striking that psycholo- 
anes gists have tended to point to it as 
an instance of sudden transition. The little child 
has been assumed to be sexless in all his interests. 
The meaning of sex suddenly, it has been held, 
dawns upon him at puberty. This view is quite 
erroneous. The sex life of the child begins at 
birth. Gradually, through the years of childhood, 
differentiation goes on, not merely in the physical 
organism but also in mental attitudes, interests, in 
general point of view. One of the important con- 
tributions of the study of early and later child- 
hood has been the discovery that sex impulses and, 
interests appear, normally, very early and develop 
as an integral part of the childhood self. The 
period of puberty, therefore, marks no abrupt trans- 
ition; but is simply the time when the long ante- 
cedent development emerges, occupies a larger 
place in the child’s horizon, and attracts the atten- 
tion of the observer so that he drops into the fallacy 
of imagining that something entirely new has sud- 
denly come into being. 
This idea of abrupt transitions has been further 
fostered by certain special cases such as religious 
conversions, which have been ex- R for be- i : : Hetitranrayt plained as rapid shifts in the 
transitions point of view. An old self is 
suddenly cast off and a new one as quickly taken 
on. Here again the observer is in danger of being

deceived by external appearances which are easy 
to observe but hard to evaluate justly. A spectac- 
ular emotional experience takes even the youth him- 
self by storm. He imagines he is almost a new 
creature. But gradually his old habits, ideas, in- 
terests and emotions assert themselves, and he 
would know, if he could properly interpret him- 
self, that this is only an indication that the appar- 
ently involuntary change which he has passed 
through has been a quite superficial affair. He is not 
radically different from what he was before. He 
may have got a new ideal, a new impulse to live dif- 
ferently, but on sober second thought it is found to 
be organically related to all that he was before. In 
so far as his experience is vital and proves to be 
permanent it is found to be merely an external 
symptom of a deeper series of changes in his in- 
terests which have been going on gradually and, 
hence, mostly unnoted. The “sudden experience,” 
is, as it were, a hitch in the stream, or current, of 
one’s life due, perhaps, to some interfering or un- 
usual circumstance in the environment such as a 
revival meeting, a new teacher, a change in ma- 
terial fortune, some new book, in fact, due to any 
of a thousand possible social forces which may 
chance to play on him at just the psychological 
moment and thereby bring vividly to consciousness 
desires or purposes hitherto only dimly appreci- 
ated. 
This is the point of view from which we shall
-P-A-G-E-99
  CHANGES IN THE TEENS 71 
approach the study of the development of youth. 
Youth is a transition period, but no more so 
than is any season of life, so long as life continues 
The point of view to be truly alive, for life is, in 
of this study its essence, change and progress 
for better or for worse. Outgrown shells of old 
ideas, old friendships, old ideals are being con- 
stantly left behind. But, alas, all do not attain a 
dome more vast nor the freedom which the poet 
longs for. 
Youth, then, is not distinctive in being a time of 
transition, and yet it does have its distinguishing 
features—features, however, which are the culmina- 
tions of all the individual’s previous development 
and of his heredity as well. It has its particular 
problems of development which are also the out- 
growth of the past and which refer specifically to 
what is about to come. The transition of youth 
is, of course, different from any other transition of 
life—behind is childhood with its narrow horizon, 
ahead is manhood and womanhood—and no one 
can doubt that the change from one to the other 
involves many problems of readjustment which de- 
mand the serious consideration of both parents and 
teachers.

one attempts to describe the mental characteristics

culty of discovering, with any accuracy, what the 
characteristics actually are. The youth is often an 
adept at concealing his real self. If we try to find 
out what he thinks and feels he will as likely as 
not fail to tell us the truth, and without malice 
either, for it is a species of instinctive self-protec- 
tion. When, then, an enthusiastic investigator 
gathers statistics about the likes and dislikes, the 
activities, interests, habits and ideals of high-school 
boys and girls, when he arranges them in tables 
and computes averages and relationships he is apt 
to be possessed of material of very uncertain value. 
If the material is entirely true, the chances are it 
is also entirely commonplace, what everybody has 
always known and taken for granted. The bare 
figures, stating averages, tendencies, etc., do not 
in any wise give a true picture of the real boy and 
girl. Of course the real boys and girls may not 
be in any wise unusual. They are probably just 
average young people, and the real life of average 
people is not usually spectacular. Their experi- 
ences do not usually furnish material for good 
“stories,” unless surrounded by some sort of arti- 
ficial glamour such as the so-called realistic nov- 
elist throws over them, thus leading us to feel that 
common life is something other than it really is. 
In a word, the basic difficulty is how to find out 
the true inner self of the youth, what is actually 
The “average” brewing in his mind down be- 
youth neath the level of commonplace
-P-A-G-E-101
CHANGES IN THE TEENS 73 
behavior. If the youth himself is liable to deceive 
us, how are we to find out anything? How are 
we to avoid the arid commonplaces of the scientist 
who prides himself in sticking to the facts? We. 
also, are after facts, but we must beware of two 
extremes; on the one hand we should not assume 
that the highly interesting and intense develop- 
ment in some young people is found in all alike; 
on the other hand we should not ignore completely 
the unusual experiences as of no value for helping 
us to understand the more ordinary types of 
youngsters. 
We shall not, in the illustrations cited in the fol- 
lowing pages, pretend that they are typical, as they 
Thevalueofthe stand, of youth generally. We 
lessusual types’ shall assume rather that in them 
we may get, in vivid relief, many suggestions as 
to the underlying nature of average boys and girls, 
suggestions as to the tendencies, impulses and so 
forth, which may never stand out clearly enough 
to be separately recognized and which yet actually 
operate to shape the course of the life of the ado- 
lescent boy or girl: As we have suggested, most 
youths are average youths but, nevertheless, in even 
the average youth there is in all probability some- 
thing distinctive and interesting if we could know 
how to find it. We know this best by the auto- 
biographies of youth which men and women are 
often able to give us in retrospect. One man in 
writing of his own youth and its strange mix-

ture of outward unconcern and inner perplexity 
and often melancholy, says, “It may be inferred 
that my above-stated belief that all boys have their 
lonely times and their hard periods is based only 
on my own experience, while the prevailing belief 
is that most boys are careless and akin to the vege- 
table in their lack of serious concern. Those who 
hold that view do not know boys well. They will 
deceive the most watchful with their unconcern, 
but the moment they are alone, and are no longer 
acting a part, they are another order of being. 
Catch the careless boy unawares and touch his 
quick with skilful finger, and you will always find 
that his tears flow extremely easy.” (1) 
This apparent callousness and indifference of 
boys and girls in their early teens, when they are 
Th | brought face to face with circum- e seeming 7 
unconcern of stances to which we older people 
ana ivens think they should respond readily 
and sympathetically, is often met with and is 
largely a protective measure which might be said 
to be almost instinctive. The boy usually feels that 
he may be unable to say or do the right thing; he 
dreads to make a mistake or to seem weak or senti- 
mental, and so he often maintains a stolid indiffer- 
ence to an appeal which he really feels keenly. He 
does not want to appear “like a fool,” and so he 
tries to avoid looking like anything. A very good 
illustration of this attitude is furnished by a boy of 
thirteen, who had committed some slight misde-
-P-A-G-E-103

CHANGES IN THE TEENS 75 
meanor in school. He was at once heartily ashamed 
of it and resolved never to do it again. Although the teacher had seen the offense, she said nothing 
about it at the time. The youngster, however, did not escape. A. few days later the teacher told him to remain after school. “She reasoned with me,” he says, “and I suppose she expected me to cry, but that wasn’t in my line. I was silent and hung my head in shame, and if she had had the good sense to let the matter rest there, things might have 
been very different with me—but she went on lecturing me.” Finally his contrition changed to defiance. The teacher noted the changed attitude 
and concluded, since he showed no signs of being 
impressed by scolding, he would have to be whipped, 
and a savage beating followed, during which 
the youngster maintained the same attitude of sul- 
len defiance. If he had only broken down and cried, the teacher would have been satisfied. But 
he, as all healthy boys would have done, felt that this was an assault upon his personality and it was far more vital to his own sense of personal respect 
to put up a show of external indifference than to 
acknowledge his fault by breaking down as the 
teacher expected him to do. (2) 
This instinctive withdrawal into one’s self; this 
hiding behind a barrier of apparent indifference 
is possibly more apt to be a characteristic of the 
early years of the teens than of the later. These 
years from thirteen to fifteen are, for most boys and
-P-A-G-E-104
  76 THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
girls, as we have seen, the years of physical ma- 
turing. The center of the personality is physio- 
logical rather than mental. As one writer has well 
expressed it, it is “a trying period when the child 
has become well cognizant of the practical world, 
but has yet no hint of the gorgeous colors of youth. 
At thirteen, for instance, one has the world pretty 
well charted, but not yet has the slow chemistry of 
time transmuted this experience into meanings and 
values. There is a grossness and materiality about 
the following three or four years that have no 
counterpart until youth is over and the sleek years 
of the forties have begun. How cock-sure and 
familiar with the world is the boy or girl at this 
age! They have no doubts, but they have no glow. 
At no time in life is one so unspiritual, so merely 
animal, so much of the earth earthy. How differ- 
ent is it to be, a few years later! How shaken and 
adventurous will the world appear then! For this 
waiting period of life the virtues are harder to dis- 
cover. Curiosity has lapsed, for there do not seem 
to be left many things to be curious about.” (3) 
It is at this time that the child, just emerging 
into youth, seems strangely stolid. He has passed 
the unquestioning responsiveness and frankness of 
childhood and he has not yet felt enough of the up- 
rushing vital force of youth to step out in any 
positive way or to assume any definite attitude of 
his own.

individuals Some children mature early and some late. It can not be otherwise in the case of the mental changes. If this period of unresponsive- 
ness occurs most often between thirteen and four- teen, it is closely associated with the period of puberty. The new impulse to physical development 
leaves the mind at first uncertain of itself. Caught 
by an uprush of unfamiliar and ill-understood im- 
pulses, the boy may withdraw more to himself and 
seem curiously indifferent to outward appeals or he may take on, more or less genuinely, a wild dare- 
devil attitude. He will take peculiar delight in breaking through the restrictions on his behavior, 
to which he has been subjected in childhood; he 
will even ruthlessly violate the principles of good conduct which careful parents have striven to in- stil into him as a child. His “wildness” at this 
time may be of a fairly harmless variety, such as indulging in mild profanity, smoking cigarettes, 
fighting, playing pranks and practical jokes, run- ning away to go swimming or fishing, and in all having a delightful sense of how wicked he is. Such a boy, if reared in a religious atmosphere, will} in his more serious moments, wonder at this time if 
he will ever get to Heaven and say to himself that 
he doesn’t care whether he does or not. 
In the past, the larger number of boys and girls

Peculiar diffi- were in the upper grades of the 
culty of school elementary school. But to-day, 
adjuster larger and larger numbers are 
finding their way to the high school. Wherever 
they are found, however, they present peculiar diffi- 
culties to the school. They lack the docility of 
childhood and the fine idealism that comes to most 
young people soon after puberty. These are the 
years of serious retardation in the grades, the years 
in which many pupils drop out of school altogether. 
It is most unfortunate that the completion of the 
elementary-school course comes for so many at such 
a time, for then of all times it is easiest for the youth 
to conclude that he does not care to go to school 
any longer or, if he continues in high school, he 
then finds it harder to adjust himself to the meth- 
ods of study and recitation and to the studies them- 
selves, which the high school thrusts upon him.

BROADENING VISION 
“In the smallest past we find an inexhaustible mine when once we begin to dig at it. A confused disordered story—the little made large and the large, small, and nothing showing its inward meaning. It is not till the past has receded many steps that before the clearest eyes it falls into coordinate pictures. It is not till the I we tell of has ceased to exist that it takes its place among other objective realities, and finds its true niche in the picture. The present and the near past is a con- fusion, whose meaning flashes on us as it slinks away into the distance.”

The intensity of the early teens now takes more 
definite shape. It is the time when the personality 
of the man and the woman begins to appear, and 
the development of personality is always interest- 
ing. Even though that personality may later settle 
down to very commonplace lines, in its initial 
stages it is always full of promise. So true is this 
that every thoughtful observer of boys and girls

of these years has felt the truth of Emerson’s ex- 
clamation—“How many promising youths!” 
The earlier years of this period are the tradi- 
tional high-school years. They are also years when 
The high- tens of thousands of boys and 
school years girls go to work, entering either 
a juvenile occupation or definitely taking hold of 
the beginnings of some trade, business or profes- 
sion. It is then that the youth emerges from the 
somewhat animal-like crassness of the pubertal 
years and begins to think of his social relationships, 
his duties and the rights and wrongs of acts. 
The writer knows a man who tells of himself 
that he was wild and uncouth in his tastes during 
New interests the early teens. He wished to be 
develop in the woods, to live like a hunter; 
he cared nothing for carefulness of dress and, in 
fact, refused to wear warm clothing, even in winter, 
At about the age of sixteen, however, he seemed 
suddenly to be born, or precipitated, into the world 
of social relationships. What the occasion of the 
change was he does not state, but it came over him 
in the course of a week or two. He began to want 
to dress properly, to wear neckties, to black his 
shoes, to be with people and to share in their life. 
This is an extreme case, but it illustrates a change 
which comes with more or less intensity to every 
boy and possibly to every girl, a change from the 
narrow life of the child to the larger life of the 
adult.

What are the characteristics of this new life 
when it first begins? So diverse are the traits, the 
tendencies, that it is hard to find 
in them any other unity than 
that of. “abundant life’ and eagerness to be and to 
do. The childhood-self, shell-like, has slipped off, 
and the young animal stands with eager expectancy 
before life’s possibilities. The season is, then, in 
a way the flood-tide of the energies of life, a time 
when all the vital forces which have centered in 
the making of this and that personal life reach their 
highest pitch, when they acquire the momentum 
and the direction which they will keep throughout 
the rest of their course. 
It is not meant that the energies of youth are as 
efficient in the work of the world as they may be 
a little later. They are as yet undisciplined, un- 
fettered, and the problem of the teachers is to har- 
ness this abundant life without quelling it. Of 
course there are large numbers of youths whose 
lives seem quite ordinary, having apparently noth- 
ing to distinguish them from the earlier or the later 
years, whose “experiences” would scarcely make a 
“good story.” : And yet the rising tide comes even 
to the average youth, rising so gradually, perhaps, 
that he is never clearly conscious that a change is 
taking place. Moreover, even though many youths 
may be quite commonplace in their experiences, the 
fact remains that at no period of life do unusual 
or a“ wrought experiences appear more fre- Abundant life

quently. It is a time when we expect intense emo- 
tions, strong reactions and, even though the tide 
may not rise high in each boy and girl, that it does 
rise high in many, is some indication of what youth 
is, is some proof that it is different from other 
periods of life. Is it fair, then, to describe youth in 
terms of the more intense experiencs of possibly 
the minority? It is indeed, if we interpret our data 
aright, not as typical experiences which come to all 
in equal degree, but rather as indicating tendencies, 
transitions, modes of action, interests about which 
all youthful experiences are grouped with varying 
shades of intensity. 
The central fact, the fact common to all adoles- 
cents, whether average or exceptional, is the 
transition from childhood to man- 
hood and womanhood. At some 
time in the early teens—for some earlier and for 
some later, for girls nearly always a year or two 
earlier than for boys—the self of childhood dis- 
solves and a new self is born. In the case of some 
children this change is more or less sudden—so 
sudden, in fact, that the child himself is startled by 
the rapid shift in his point of view. Perhaps it 
would be more correct to say that the transition 
is, in such cases, effected through a series of 
changes, one of which stands out and is always 
remembered as typical of the shift from childhood 
to manhood. Sometimes the change is so gradual 
that one knows only after a number of years that The new self
-P-A-G-E-111
BROADENING VISION 83 
one is somehow different from what one was to 
start with, that now one no longer looks at the 
world with the eyes of a child, but when or how 
one has changed one can not tell. 
Sometimes the change is largely intellectual; 
sometimes it is strongly emotional and throbbing 
with rebellion against authority, 
with fierce passion and lofty 
idealism, But even such intensely wrought changes 
are often forgot, and the man is apt to assert 
there was nothing unusual about his youth. 
It is impossible to state with any accuracy the 
proportion of youths whose early adolescence is 
marked by striking intellectual and emotional 
changes, but it is probable, as we have said, that 
“high-light” experiences are the exception rather 
than the rule. The floods rise gradually and the 
youth is borne aloft so gently he usually does not 
give any thought to the matter. But even if he does 
not appreciate the upheaval in himself, he behaves 
differently and needs to be treated differently than 
when he was a child. Whatever the change may 
be like, it always occurs in one way or another, and 
the years involved are always important ones. They 
are years that demand the special attention of 
older and wiser heads that no mishaps may occur.

the youth, born into the great world of social re- 
lationships and duties, is played upon by countless 
external forces which do actually divert his ener- 
gies this way or that and determine the things he 
shall value and strive for. The youth’s native 
ability counts, of course, for as much as it ever did; 
it is the vitalizing, drawing force in the whole proc- 
ess, but it furnishes only the raw material for the 
well-rounded adult life. It will largely depend on 
the opportunities afforded, on the play of edu- 
cational and social forces, what becomes of this 
native energy. 
By the first birth, the child comes into a physical 
environment, a bundle of primitive appetites and 
Gontrastwith impulses. He demands with un- 
the first birth reasoning imperiousness that his 
animal wants be satisfied. He is eager to use his 
limbs and voice, and this eagerness brings him into 
contact with a wide variety of experiences. He 
learns how to act in the world of physical things 
that surround him, he learns to understand people 
after a fashion, but after all it is a narrow life he 
lives, at the best. He is surrounded by the great 
grown-up world, but his understanding of it is at 
most superficial. It makes various demands on 
him which he only partly understands. As he ap- 
proaches physiological maturity in his early or 
middle teens, however, he feels the throbbing of 
new impulses. The world of men and women 
gradually opens up to him and he is finally born
-P-A-G-E-113
he ’ 
BROADENING VISION 85 
into it. This world is a larger and more complex 
one than any he has hitherto known. He faces a 
new problem, that of learning to understand, to 
live, to move, in short to find himself in this larger 
world of social relationships, of men and women. 
The study of adolescence has two possible ob- 
jects, the one, to discover as far as possible the na- 
Why study tural tendencies and character- 
adolescence? istics of the period, and the other, 
to determine how they can best be brought to a 
al _issue in maturity, that no untoward 
events or influences may dwarf the budding spirit 
of maturity or start it to developing along lines 
which will harm or destroy its future efficiency. 
The birth of the new self in the teens is oft 
fraught with quite as much danger as the birth that 
first brought the child into the world, 
The new self of the teens is a new creature and 
yet not absolutely new. It is built upon the self of 
Continuity ofthe Childhood, and its successful is- 
oldand new selves sue depends quite as much on the 
child who has preceded as on the influences which 
surround the youth himself. If the childhood of 
the boy or girl has been normal; if it has unfolded 
in the midst of wholesome surroundings, the pros- 
pects are auspicious for a similar growth through 
the critical period of the teens. The stage of 
physical maturity will be reached at the proper time 
" and passed over at the proper rate. If the child 
has been treated as a reasonable being, if he has
-P-A-G-E-114
  86 THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
been guided rather than driven, if he has had suit- 
able opportunity to express his impulses rather than 
had them repressed by the stern authority of un- 
sympathetic elders, he should pass the critical pe- 
riod serenely and joyously. If his earlier treatment 
has been of the harsh repressive type his manhood 
may be stormy and tumultuous. If for any reason 
his physical development has been interfered with 
in childhood, either through lack of proper food 
or because of disease or exacting labor, the trans- 
ition to maturity may be deferred two or three 
years, and then his all too slender resources will 
be taxed to their utmost to do in a few short months, 
perhaps, what he should have had at least a year, 
and probably more, to accomplish. In short, the 
kind of childhood one has had largely forecasts the 
sort of youth that may be expected. 
No one has perhaps caught the spirit of youth 
more truly than has Jane Addams, in her descrip- 
The quest of tion of her journey, as a girl, to 
the youth Madison, Wisconsin, to see Old 
Abe, the war eagle. “We started,” she says, “one

for the heroic and perfect which so persistently 
haunts the young; and as I stood under the great 
white dome of Old Abe’s stately home, for one brief 
moment the search was rewarded. I dimly caught 
a hint of what men have tried to say in their world-

that it shall hold only yearning devotion and high- 
hearted hopes.” (1) 
All of us who have ever had a season of youth 
find it easy to say many things about it, and yet 
_~ His spirit char- we must not let our descriptions 
acterized too readily run over into fixed 
generalizations. The descriptions, nevertheless, are 
of great value, and those that we find in poetry 
and general literature often throw much important 
light on the lives of these boys and girls whom we 
know and have to teach. The following words of 
a recent writer, himself barely past the period 
of youth, are suggestive: 
“How shall I describe youth, the time of con- 
tradictions and anomalies? The fiercest radicalisms 
and most dogged conservatisms, irrepressible gay- 
ety, bitter melancholy—all these moods are equally 
part of that showery spring-time of life. One 
thing, at least, it clearly is: a great, rich rush and 
flood of energy. It is as if the store of life had 
been accumulating through the slow placid years 
of childhood, and suddenly the dam had broken 
and the waters rushed out, furious and uncon- 
trolled, before settling down into the quieter chan- 
nels of middle life. The youth is suddenly seized 
with a poignant consciousness of being alive, which 
is quite wanting to the naive, unquestioning exist- 
ence of the child. He finds himself overpoweringly 
urged to self-expression. Just as the baby, born 
into a ‘great, blooming, buzzing confusion’ and
-P-A-G-E-116
   
  88 THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
attracted by every movement, every color, every 
sound, kicks madly in response in all directions, 
and only gradually gets his movements coordinated 
into the orderly and precise movements of his 
elders, so the youth, suddenly born into a confusion 
of ideas and appeals and traditions, responds in the 
most chaotic way to this new spiritual world, and 
only gradually learns to find his way about in it 
and get his thoughts and feelings into some kind of 
order.” (2) 
In these words we have a vivid suggestion of 
what youth is in many a boy and girl, in so far as 
it is distinct from other periods of life. If the 
majority of boys and girls pass through no such 
intense period, it means only that, in so far, their 
development during youth lacks any clear demar- 
cation from later life. But even though the per- 
son may, in after years, regard his youth as un- 
eventful or as set off in no way from the rest of 
his life, we can hardly believe but that he has for- 
got; that he must have had some time, even 
though short, of budding aspiration and fervid en- 
thusiasm, some time when the self of the child 
changed into the self of the man. 
That there is such a transition time for every 
individual, even though gradual for most, and with 
Spiritual in- widely differing characteristics, 
tensity high none of us can doubt. That in 
many cases the period is one of great intensity of 
life both intellectually and emotionally, many of    
-P-A-G-E-117
BROADENING VISION 89 
us can testify, and the biographies of many men 
and women corroborate our own experiences. The 
testimony of the poets also is not to be ignored. We 
are always interested in what the poet may have to 
say about this or that period of life, because, if he 
is sincere, if he has really lived, his words often 
illuminate dark pathways and his flashes of inspira- 
tion suggest values and give a perspective to facts 
which the rigid scientist may altogether miss. 
Let us turn our attention for a moment to the 
preceding quotation. What discriminating teacher 
of boys and girls has not noted some of the char- 
acteristics there mentioned? Every one of them 
is a natural outcome of the transition from child- 
hood to manhood. The child is literally swamped 
with the rising tide of vital energy within him-

For the time being he does not know how to act. 
It is not strange that his responses should be chaotic 
and often characterized by ill-directed enthusiasm.

The latter, furthermor , is different in that it re- 
quires a longer period and is dependent for its out- 
come on educational influences. Something at that 
time occurs in the life of the youth analogous to 
the experience of the immigrant suddenly plunged 
into the swirl of an American city. The peasant 
life of Europe, with its primitive modes of in- 
dustry and its narrow intellectual horizon, corre- 
sponds to childhood. Let this peasant be trans- 
ferred to a noisy throbbing factory town in America 
and we find him confronted with most serious prob- 
lems of adjustment to the new industrial and social 
order. He is at first dazed and staggered by the 
mad rushing life about him; where can he take 
hold, what can he do? How often it occurs that 
the skill and the character of a high order, which 
he brings with him from beyond the seas, find no 
place whatever in the American city, and he is com- 
pelled to eke out his existence and is crushed down 
to a lower level of vocation and of living than he 
knew in the old home, narrow though that was. 
The problem of the immigrant is that he shall not 
lose everything of value out of his past as he finds 
himself in the crasser, even though larger, Amer- 
ican life. The swirling American city needs just 
the fine qualities, the skill in workmanship, the 
social morality, the fine traditions of the imme- 
morial past that the better immigrants bring with 
them. If they are to be transformed into good

American citizens it will not be by ruthlessly cast- 
ing off as rubbish all their past lives, but rather by 
building upon them as a foundation the structure of 
their American citizenship, for, as Goethe says, 
“Reverence for the past is the basis of all sound 
progress.” (1) 
In just this manner is a normal‘transition from 
childhood to manhood to be sought. Although at 
3 first it seems that the child-self 
srefoundation must be cast aside: like ‘an outs 
turityinahealth- grown shell in order that a new 
ever and totally different life may be 
entered into, this is not ordinarily what should oc+ 
cur. It should be rather through a series of ad- 
justments and extensions of the childhood life that 
the youth comes to manhood. 
The life of the normal child should furnish a 
fund of experiences which will be of permanent 
value to him as he passes through life. It too often 
occurs otherwise, however. The ‘demands of the 
new life opening up to him seem utterly different 
from anything that he has as yet known. If he 
has had a reasonably normal life as a child, this 
absolute cutting loose from childhood morality and 
ideals is decidedly unfortunate. One of the great 
educational problems of youth is, therefore, to ef- 
fect the transition in such a way as to preserve in 
the life of the adult all the finer qualities of child- 
hood. experience.

The happy | solution of this problem demands a

with childhood understanding of each individual 
ee child, for the problem is always 
more or less different with each individual. But 
sympathy is not the only quality demanded. It is 
quite as essential to understand the place of wise 
guidance. The youth’s mental life is rapidly en- 
larging and is, in these middle teens, being stirred 
to unusual activity. It is natural for him to look 
back on his childhood-self and, all that was asso- 
ciated with it somewhat disdainfully. This attitude 
must be appreciated by the older people who sur- 
round him, but it should not be regarded as some- 
thing final. It is rather to be taken as a symptom 
of a change, which may be good or bad according 
to the way it is treated or guided. 
Both boys and girls in their middle and later 
teens are gaining new ideas and new points of view 
so rapidly that they easily imagine their experiences 
are different from those of any one else, especially 
that they are different from any their elders have 
ever had. The impulse to assert themselves posi- 
tively is very strong, and within limits this is not a 
bad thing. How ready they are to give informa- 
tion of all sorts in the family, and to expect re- 
spectful attention! When they do not get the re- 
sponse they think they should have they easily 
imagine that their parents or teashers do not “un-

derstand” them. Some children will then develop the habit of concealing their real interests and aims; 
they will turn in on themselves and become morose and given to self-pity. Others will become all the more aggressive and will be obsessed with a deter- mination to reform their parents and surroundings 
generally. They think they know more than their mothers, they criticize their fathers, give advice to their grandparents and are “willing to decide all questions for the younger members of the fam- 
ily.” (3) All such attitudes, we say, must be dealt with, not harshly and summarily, but as symptoms of the 
Significance of struggle of the child to find him- 
the self-assertion self in a larger circle of relation- 
of the youth ships and duties. 
The teacher or parent who “understands” will 
not blame the boy for this eager desire to assert 
himself, but will strive, in various ways, to help him 
see that the most direct road for him to an effect- 
ive manhood will lie in the direction of continued 
sympathy with his home life and continued respect 
for his parents. Humble though their lot, and nar- 
row though their vision may seem to him to be, 
he should be led to see something fine and noble in 
all their toil, something into which the roots of his 
own being go, and to which he must ever be loyal 
if he is ever to be a true man himself. Self-evi- 
dent this seems, and yet how many boys and girls,

home surroundings! When times of difficulty and 
struggle come to such as these, we find them turn- 
ing to some friend outside the family for advice, 
with the thought that such a one will “understand” 
better than can the father or the mother. 
Mistaken as this whole attitude is, it can so easily 
develop as the boy or girl journeys from childhood 
into maturity!

CHAPTER VII 
THE BIRTH OF A NEW SELF 
HE great problem of the youth is that of find- 
ing himself in the world of work, social en- 
joyment and duty that surrounds him. This is not 
altogether a problem of adjust- 
ment. It is quite as much a prob- 
lem of building up a new personality in which shall 
be fused all that is vital in the world about him 
with that which is unique or original in himself, 
for in every human being something new, some- 
thing individual, is brought into the world. And 
progress is possible in so far as each youth does not 
merely conform to life as he finds it, but makes it 
over to some extent in terms of himself. 
The normal adolescent feels keenly the impulse 
to be himself, to question all traditions and all as- 
The impulse of sumptions, to think things out for 
self-assertion himself, whether it be in litera- 
ture or in art, in religion, in morals, or in social 
duties. And his impulse is good, even though he 
may find, in the end, that his conclusions are not 
so very different from those of others before him. 
It is through this impulse to think for himself that

  he finds himself a j ees his right to be a man 
among men. 
Very dhckraibtertdtie mental attitudes are apt to 
attend the process of finding one’s self in the larger 
The youth a world of social relationships, at- 
dreamer titudes not always appreciated by 
teachers and parents. He feels at first a vague un- 
rest in his groping for a larger life. The adoles- 
cent is traditionally a dreamer. He longs for that 
which he can not express even to himself. He feels 
somehow that he is face to face with a great thought 
which, thus far, no man has ever grasped; he feels 
he is about to solve the riddle of existence, which 
hitherto has baffled even the world’s greatest minds. 
The poets who have begun to write in their youth 
give frequent expression to this haunting sense of 
being on the verge of a great discovery. No words 
could more aptly express this feeling than those 
verses of Tennyson, beginning: 
“Break, break, break, 
On thy cold gray stones, O sea! 
And I would that my tongue could utter 
The thoughts that arise in me.” 
This little poem is a typical exclamation of 
adolescence, not merely in its suggestion of some 
great thought which grips the soul, which the youth 
longs to put forth into words, and which yet seems 
to baffle all his power of expression, but also in the 
sense of something mysteriously beautiful and

significant in the play of children on the beach and 
in the passage of the ships to their haven under the 
hill, - % 
Longfellow, in such poems as the Prelude and My 
Lost Youth, strikes a similar vein, that of being 
overwhelmed with meanings which he longs to ex- 
press but which defy his capacity to put into words. 
This keen sense of unfathomed, haunting mys- 
tery which the youth feels and which he imagines 
ie ct aes he, of all people who have lived, 
has somehow chanced to discover 
is in part the expansion of his being toward the 
charm and mystery of the opposite sex. Perhaps 
it is the first manifestation of sex love, not of 
course understood as such, but indicating never- 
theless the enlargement of interests and ideals which 
must be at the basis of all healthful development 
of his relations with woman. 
We have emphasized the gradual character of 
the transformations of youth and yet there are 
Ortaca inde: nodal points or crises when the 
velopment aspect of things seems to change 
pretty definitely. Not that there is necessarily any 
sudden break in the course of development. It is 
rather that hidden forces, as we have said, gradually 
come to the surface and make themselves evident 
and, because we have not noted them before, we 
are often inclined to think that something new has 
been interposed. These crises, or turning points, 
are rather analogous to the experience of a traveler

who arrives at 5 turn in his road that brings to him 
a new vista or who, surmounting a range of hills 
or a mountain, sees for the first time a winding river 
and a fertile valley beyond. 
Such a crisis in the life of a group of boys and 
girls in their middle teens is thus penetratingly de- 
scribed by Mrs. Deland. “Eliza- 
beth’s long braids had been al- 
ways attractive to the masculine eye; they had sug- 
gested jokes about pigtails, and much of that pe- 
culiar humor so pleasing to the young male; but 
the summer she ‘put up her hair,’ the puppies, so to 
speak, got their eyes open. When the boys saw 
those soft plaits, no longer hanging within easy 
reach of a rude and teasing hand, but folded around 
her head behind her little ears; when they saw the 
small curls breaking over and through the brown 
braids of spun silk, clustering in the nape of her 
neck; when David and Blair saw these things, . . . 
something below the artless brutality of the boys’ 
sense of humor was touched. They took abruptly 
their first perilous step out of boyhood. Of course 
they did not know it. . . . The significant 
moment came one afternoon when they all went out 
to the tollhouse for ice-cream. . . . As they 
sat eating their cream together, Blair suddenly saw 
the sunshine sparkle in Elizabeth’s hair, and his 
spoon paused midway to his lips. ‘Oh, say, isn’t 
Elizabeth’s hair nice? he said. David turned and 
looked at it, ‘I’ve seen lots of girls with hair like An illustration
-P-A-G-E-127
  
/

that,’ he said; but he sighed and scratched his left 
ankle with his right foot. Blair, smiling to him- 
self, put out a hesitating finger and touched a shim- 
mering curl; upon which Elizabeth ducked and 
laughed, and dancing over to the old tin pan of a 
piano pounded out ‘Shoo fly’ with one finger. Blair, 
watching the lovely color in her cheek, said in hon- 
est delight, ‘When your face gets red like that you 
are awfully good looking, Elizabeth.’ 
“ “Good looking’ ; that was a new idea to the four 
friends. Nannie gaped; Elizabeth giggled; David 
‘got red’ on his own account and muttered under 
his breath. But into Blair’s face had come, sud- 
denly, a new expression; his eyes smiled vaguely; 
he came sidling over to Elizabeth and stood beside 
her, sighing deeply: ‘Elizabeth, you are an aw- 
ful nice girl.’ Elizabeth shrieked with laughter, 
‘Listen to Blair, he’s spoony!’ 
“Tnstantly Blair was angry; ‘spooniness’ vanished 
in a flash; he did not speak for fully five minutes.” 
They presently started home, “but,” says Mrs. 
Deland, with keen insight into the nature of youth, 
“childhood for all of them ended that after- 
noon.” (1) 
As Bourne says: “Youth expresses itself by 
falling in love. Whether it be art, a girl, socialism, 
The youth religion, the sentiment is the 
falls in love same; the youth is swept away 
by a flood of love. He has learned to value, and 
how superlative and magnificent are his values!

The little child hardly seems to love; indeed his 
indifference to grown people, even to his own par- 
ents, is often amazing. He has the simple affection 
of a young animal, but how different his cool re- 
gard from the passionate flame of youth! Love is 
youth’s virtue, and it is wide as well as deep. There 
is no tragic antithesis between a youth’s devotion 
to a cause and his love for a girl, They are not 
mutually exclusive, as romanticists often love te 
think, but Faden. compatible. They tend to 
fuse and they stimulate and ennoble each other, 
The first love of youth for anything is pure and 
ethereal and disinterested. It is only when thwarted 
that love turns sensual, only when mocked that 
enthusiasm becomes fanatical and mercenary. 
Worldly opinion seems to care much more for 
personal love than for the love of ideals. It gives 
suffrage and approval to the love of a youth for a 
girl, but it mocks and discredits the enthusiast. It 
just grudgingly permits the artist to live, but it piles 
almost insurmountable obstacles in the path of the 
young radical. The course of true love may never 
run smooth, but what of the course of true ideal- 
ism?” (2) 
This passage, though from a prose poet rather 
than a scientist, is full of deep insight into the 
Theseximpulse Psychology of youth, and it is 
the hidden spring worth studying. The sex impulse 
is the hidden spring, the underlying motive of much, 
if not all, of the interesting and worth-while de-

velopment of this period, and a happy transition to 
adult life depends almost altogether on how this 
impulse is utilized. As Jane Addams well says: 
“The early manifestations of this impulse are for 
the most part vague and formless, and are abso- 
lutely without definition to the youth himself. Some 
months and years elapse before the individual mate 
is selected and determined upon, and during the 
time when the differentiation is not complete—and 
it often is not—there is a great deal of groping 
and waste. This period of groping is complicated 
by the fact that the youth’s power for appreciating 
is far ahead of his ability for expression. ‘The 
inner traffic fairly obstructs the outer current,’ and 
it is nothing short of cruelty to overstimulate his 
senses as does the modern city.” (3) 
It would seem, then, to be absolutely essential 
to normal development that the sex impulse, as a 
Early diffu- definite and conscious factor in 
sion needful the life of the youth, should 
emerge in some wholesome way from this back- 
ground of general idealism and vague longing. The 
interests which may thus develop will be the driv- 
ing impulses and motives for all the rest of his 
life. In the season of youth itself this dispersion 
of the sex impulse furnishes a ballast that will keep 
the boy and the girl steady on many tumultuous 
waters. To quote from Miss Addams again: “If 
the values [associated with sex] are dispensed over 
the world, the young person suddenly seems to

have discovered a beauty and significance in many 
things—he responds to poetry, he becomes a lover 
of nature, he is filled with eligious devotion or 
with philanthropic zeal. Experience, with young 
people, easily illustrates the possibility and value 
of diffusion.” (3) 
What a powerful appeal to youth is made by 
Tennyson’s Maud! Although sex love is the dom- 
inant motive, it is effectively in- Associated with E 
esthetic appre- terwoven with many other life- 
anog interests and finally it is trans- 
formed into high ethical purposes. Such passion 
easily runs over into the esthetic appreciation of 
nature: 
“There has fallen a splendid tear 
From the passion-flower at the gate, 
She is coming, my dove, my dear; 
She is coming, my life, my fate; 
The red rose cries, ‘She is near, she is near’; 
And the white rose weeps, ‘She is late’; 
The larkspur listens, ‘I hear, I hear’; 
And the lily whispers, ‘I wait.’ ” 
Every boy and girl whose mind has not been 
too early opened to the meaning of those manifold 
Overstimulation Suggestions of a sex nature which 
in modern life pervade and render unhealthful 
the average social environment, will at first develop. 
in this general way, especially in the direction 
of the esthetic appreciation of nature.and of a 
passion for lofty ideals. But modern society, or

rather modern commercialism, has, with an almost 
sardonic insight into the psychology of youth, set 
a multitude of traps to thwart the normal method 
of development. The moving-picture shows, even 
the censored ones, are teeming with suggestions 
of sex impulse; so also the vaudeville and the pop- 
ular songs, the dances, the stories, the pictures, 
whether of genuine art or on flaming bill-boards, 
all combine to give definite form and content to 
the sex susceptibility which should at first have been 
diffused throughout the personality, giving it char- 
acter and driving power. 
The great need of adolescent education, whether 
in the school or in the home, is just this, of tid- 
is cdtica- ing the youth through these criti- 
tional need cal years, presenting to him abun- 
dant opportunities for satisfying his expanding 
sense of selfhood in wholesome athletics, in oratory, 
in debate, in art, in literature, in appreciation of 
natural beauty, in scientific experiment and in vari- 
ous forms of simple social service. “It is neither 
a short nor an easy undertaking to substitute the 
love of beauty for mere desire, to place the mind 
above the senses; but is not this the sum of the 
immemorial obligation which rests upon the adults ! 
of each generation if they would nurture and re- | 
strain the youth, and has not the whole history of 
civilization been but one long effort to substitute 
psychic impulsion for the driving force of blind ap- 
petite?” (3)

We should not, then, Part these new inter- 
ests in a narrow sense. The central fact of sexual 
Secondaryman- maturity is, it is true, at the first, 
ifestations the dominant and all-compelling 
one. For a time it holds the attention of the youth, 
in one way or another, in its more limited physi- 
cal aspects. But if his surroundings are normal 
and hygienic; if his physical development is unre- 
tarded and his opportunities for self-expression in 
a good social environment are what they should 
‘be, these basic and, in themselves, animal instincts, 
broaden out into a host of allied interests. This 
broadening of the sex impulse has been spoken of 
as a process of irradiation, or of expansion. The 
whole tendency of the better phases of modern civ- 
ilized society is to afford manifold opportunities for 
a diverse expression of the new life. As the basis 
of these secondary manifestations it becomes the 
key, the hidden motive to every conceivable en- 
richment in the life of later youth and of all the 
succeeding years of maturity. New appreciations 
of nature, of poetry, of history and of biography 
rapidly unfold. 
To many a boy, some field of modern science 
opens up a veritable fairy-land of wonder and op- 
portunity. Others crave adventure and forget all 
else in its mad quest. The pulse of the explorer 
and of the buccaneer begins to throb in their veins. 
Friendship assumes a new meaning. The mind of 
the youth begins to open up to the characteristics

of strength and of weakness in his more mature 
associates. He becomes a hero-worshiper; an ar~ 
dent admirer of the man who can do things; who 
can lead his fellow men or direct their energies 
to the working out of some purpose. He is as 
yet not always able to distinguish worthy from 
unworthy purposes. His outlook, at first, lacks per- 
spective or a due sense of proportion. He is often 
quite as ready to admire and imitate the base and 
selfish manifestation of power as the more enlight- 
ened, socialized types. But he is not lacking in 
appreciation of the deeper ethical and social re- 
lations and duties of men. 
A vague crude idealism is a part of the life of 
all early adolescence, an idealism that is often early 
nipped in the bud or suffers in its development a 
pitiful miscarriage. But there is an idealism there 
to start with and often it carries the youth over 
many untoward circumstances and renders him 
oblivious to many of the sordid influences that play 
upon him and strive to ‘check his gropings after 
the larger life which he feels is unfolding before 
him. Healthful, vigorous outdoor exercises, con- 
structive work of all sorts, opportunities for social 
service, religious exercises make powerful appeals 
to him and afford so many fruitful avenues for 
the expression of this new life that first comes 
to his consciousness in the impulses associated with 
sexual maturity. 
Every youth is, then, an incipient reformer, a

missionary, impatient with what seem to him the 
Tmpacielen pith pettiness and the obtuseness of 
existing con- the adult world about him. It is 
ainone true that many aspects of this 
adult world are petty and bound down by useless 
compromise with ideals. The adult world needs 
the vitalizing energy of each new generation of 
youths to open its eyes or even to sweep it, if 
need be, off its feet and knock from under it the 
props of tradition and of complacency. And yet 
the world of mature men and women is not quite 
so blind and halting as the youth often imagines, 
and as he will discover for himself when he finds 
his own place within it. 
The advice of Wendell Phillips that the young 
man should identify himself with some great but 
unpopular cause finds a ready response in the vague 
longings of the adolescent who is fortunate enough 
to be living in a community or in a country where 
some burning social question is agitating the social 
conscience. 
How common it is for boys and girls in their 
teens to feel that they have been born to fill some 
great place in life! Take any 
group of high-school pupils of 
past sixteen, and what aspirations, nay, even settled 
convictions as to the high part they are to play 
in the world may we, who gain their confidence, 
discover hidden in their inmost hearts. This one

a statesman, still another a great musician or an 
orator. We do not, indeed, mention this to dis- 
credit such a spirit of high resolve. Nothing in 
human life is finer, in a way, than this. The spirit 
of great men is essentially the spirit of youth with 
its never-ending enthusiasms, its untiring energy, 
its daring, its vision. It is not strange that so 
many of the world’s great soldiers, reformers, 
prophets, poets, musicians, statesmen have been 
young men and women, 
When we read the biographies of such people 
we find them strangely like the boys and girls 
whom we see every day in our 
high schools, and on our streets 
and farms. The world’s renewned seem to have 
been able to carry to a fuller realization than most 
of us succeed in doing, the impulses which throb 
in the breast of almost every live, adolescent boy 
or girl. These high-school years are years of prom- 
ise. The pity of it is that later years are not 
inclined to view the promises of youth with suffi- 
cient indulgence. Too few of these fine anticipa- 
tions of greatness ever get worked out. Not that 
these children should all normally grow up to be 
gifted men and women. The plea is rather that 
they should carry over into their maturity some 
of the enthusiasm and vision of youth. Even the 
humblest work that they may take up has a need 
of being transfused and enriched with the fiery 
zeal of adolescence. Youth and genius

This is the time when boys and girls are hun- 
gry for Dole biography. How many a time does 
one of our pupils feel, as he reads the story of a 
* great thought or sees that thought worked out into 
a great deed, “That is just the thing I was trying 
to say, to do.” He finds his own best aspiring 
self pictured in the life of the statesman, of the 
reformer, of the missionary, and this glimpse, help- 
ing him to know himself better, is an important 
factor in his own development. 
Many a tinte, of course, the larger vision of 
life does not have opportunity to develop in nor- 
mal surroundings. The fine im- 
pulse “to be something in the 
world” may easily run into semi- if not actual 
criminality. Many investigators have called our at- 
tention to the large percentage of crime that comes 
from the hands of the youth. Fortunately, much 
of it is not the expression of a really vicious na- 
ture, but of the misguided impulse to find adven- 
ture, to see life, to do something big and startling. 
It is not necessary here to tt into the long and 
pitiful story of adolescent faults and crimes. The

  CHAPTER VIII 
CHARACTERISTIC PHASES AND DANGERS OF THE 
NEW SELF > 
  LTHOUGH it is a truism to say that child- 
A hood and youth are formative periods in 
the life of the individual, there are practical con- 
Practical con- sequences of this principle which 
pequenes are often neglected. It is too 
often assumed that the process of binding together 
of traits into the permanent character of maturity 
may be allowed to take care of itself, except in 
those cases where actual criminality may appear. 
But even in those cases the difficulty is not treated 
with a penetrating insight into the causes, but by 
means of stupid, rough-handed restraint in a re- 
formatory which often treads ruthlessly on youth- 
nature, making matters worse rather than better. 
The formative period of youth is particularly im- 
portant, because the traits of character that are then 
Catalina (hs established, and the pattern of 
later teens often —_ personality into which they are 
permet woven, are apt to remain per- 
manent, While all stages of life—manhood as

well as childhood—possess a certain degree of plas- 
ticity, far-reaching or fundamental changes in in- 
terests, tastes, temperament, purposes and ideals 
are much less likely to occur after twenty years 
than they are before. 
We can then truly say that the paramount need 
of the latter half of the teens, the period when 
many boys and girls are in high school and in the 
first two college years, is the need of securing a 
well-balanced set of intellectual, social and moral 
ideals bound together by dependable habits of ex- 
pression in every-day life, 
The raw materials that must be utilized in this 
final stage of character building have already been 
The final stage partly described. There is, un- 
in character derneath all the vague unrest, the 
pedaing reaching out after a larger, more 
complete life. There are the many enthusiasms, the 
feeling that life has something in store that is 
unique and even great. There are the many per- 
plexities attendant upon the dawning sense of life’s 
obligations, the conflict of ideals, the seeming 
strange blindness of middle-aged men and women 
to needs and to courses of action that, to the youth, 
seem so obvious that to ignore them seems to be 
proof only of moral turpitude. The attitude of 
many a youth is fitly described by Miss Addamg 
as “idealistic impatience with existing condi- 
tions.” (1)

of td youth himself, A his ability to do single- 
The self-confi- handed, what the world’s wisest 
dence of youth have somehow failed to reach, is 
furnished by a boy of forty years ago who went up 
from the farm to a little denominational college. 
He had heard that the theory of evolution was be- 
ing taught in the geology classes, That such teach- 
ing should be gaining a foothold in the college 
seemed to him to point not merely to an unbelieving 
state of mind in the geology professor, but to a 
peculiar inability, if not blindness, in those who 
still adhered to the Bible. It seemed to him that 
some one should be found who should be able to 
meet the doctrine of evolution not merely by the 
plain assertions of Scripture, but who should also 
be able to take the very facts on which the geol- 
ogist based his arguments and by more clear-headed 
reasoning show the utter fallacy of the theory of 
evolution. That he himself should actually be able 
to do this which other people had stupidly failed 
to do was his firm conviction and determination. 
How strange that people should have been so blind 
to such an obvious duty; but, on the other hand, 
what an opportunity it was for him! Surely none 
but a youth could have formulated such a purpose! 
It is hardly necessary to add that the good old pro- 
fessor of geology carefully introduced this aspiring 
boy into a world of facts of which he, before, knew 
nothing, and his keen mind was soon enlisted as

an ardent champion of the teaching he had imag- 
ined it was to be his peculiar mission to overthrow. 
The vague unrest, even though unexplained by 
the adolescent himself, coupled with an ardent im- 
A danger and an pulse to assert himself in the 
Opportunity world, to be a person of influence, 
is both the danger and the opportunity of that time. 
It is astoundingly easy for the youth’s life to get 
set in a narrow channel or to acquire some unde- 
sirable form of expression. This is largely, if not 
entirely, due to his very great susceptibility to every 
surrounding social influence. “Through this sensi- 
tiveness the deadly pressures get their purchase on 
the soul; it is also the season for the most momen- 
tous and potent influences for good. In youth, if 
there is the possibility that the soul be permanently 
warped out of shape, there is also the possibility 
that it may receive the nourishment that enables it 
to develop its own robust beauty.” (2) 
Every thoughtful teacher of boys and girls in 
their teens has noted the tendency above suggested 
to develop well marked types, or 
moods. In a degree these types 
are not radical departures from the character the 
youth has had as achild. They are simply the child- 
hood characters in a further stage of development, 
but now brought out and more clearly demarcated as 
types of character, because of the larger and better 
defined social relations into which the child has Adolescent types

  | (‘THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
emerged. In some degree also they are the product 
of the effort of the child to find himself in the larger 
world. Concretely, what we mean is this: Traits 
of timidity, sociability, curiosity, truthfulness, se- 
cretiveness, frankness, love of beauty, love of out- 
door sports, of reading, if prominent in childhood, 
are quite apt to appear in the youth with such defi- 
niteness as to be distinguishing characteristics, 
simply because he is living now in an environment 
which tends to throw into strong relief all marked 
personal traits. 
The unrest and the effort at social adjustment 
will also often tend to throw into the foreground 
and produce an extreme develop- 
ment of some one childhood trait 
which was, to start with, in nowise conspicuous. 
Thus we find it possible to describe many adolescent 
boys and girls by some one or more dominant char- 
acteristics. They are aggressive or retiring, cheer- 
ful or morose, very scrupulous or quite unscrupu- 
lous, and so on indefinitely. Sometimes the same 
_ person belongs at different times to strikingly differ- 
ent types, which then become moods between which 
he alternates in most unaccountable ways. But 
each and all of these exaggerated types, or moods, 
are incidents in the development of the man and the 
woman. They are of great significance to parent 
and teacher because of the danger that the youthful 
character may so definitely set in some one of these 
molds, even though it be a good one, as to interfere 114 
Explanation

CHARACTERISTIC PHASES II5 
with the proper rounding out into mature life. The 
greatest danger, however, lies in the possibility of 
undesirable dispositions becoming fixed and per- 
manent for life. It is safe to say that whatever 
characteristics are allowed to assert themselves in 
this period are very apt to remain permanent. A 
boy who habitually permits himself to be morose, 
untruthful, insincere, unsociable, sensual or ill- 
tempered up to the time he is twenty, will have 
great difficulty making himself over into anything 
else. It is a crucial time when, as quoted above, 
the “soul may be permanently warped out of 
shape.” 
This view is contrary to much popular super- 
stition regarding this period of life. These moods 
Need of wise and dispositions are often looked 
direction upon as mere passing incidents of 
growth, which will later be sloughed off and a new 
character appear; the boy is permitted to sow his 
wild oats, the girl to be ill-tempered and malicious 
in her treatment of others. The parent or teacher 
is apt to feel that his responsibility for training 
ceases when the child arrives at youth. All too 
readily he is surrendered to his own devices. “Just 
at the time when he becomes really sensitive for the 
first time to spiritual influences, he is deprived of 
this closest and warmest influence of the home.” 
Instead of being “brought into a haven,” he has 
been “launched into a heaving and troubled sea.” 
“This is the time when his character lies at stake, 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
          F { 
116 rf HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
and the possibility of his being a radical, individual 
force in the world hangs in the balance.” (2) 
It matters, then, tremendously for the youth’s 
future what habits of action and thought he now 
drifts into or consciously adopts, 
An excellent illustration may be given of a young 
girl, a leader among those of her age, attractive in 
Anillustration | many ways, and clever. She was 
careless, however, of her words; she was often in- 
sincere, untruthful and malicious. Now, as a grown 
woman, the dominant traits of her maturity are 
those of her late girlhood. She did not outgrow 
them; on the contrary they fastened themselves 
upon her. She has few real friends—everybody is 
afraid of her biting tongue, no one trusts her to 
carry out a promise or do a single thing from pure: 
personal disinterestedness. 
There is a definite and practical significance in 
these facts for those who have anything to do with 
The youth should the guidance of adolescents. First 
helphimself = of all is the tendency of some 
one mood or trait of child-character to emerge and 
assume, in youth, a dominant rdle. This, as we 
have pointed out, is largely the resultant of the way 
the youth responds to the many social stimuli 
which, for the first time, he keenly feels. The ef- 
fort to find himself, to assert himself in this larger 
circle of activities, or to maintain himself against 
the dominating personalities of others, causes him 
to 1 a more or less characteristic attitude or
-P-A-G-E-145
CHARACTERISTIC PHASES 117 
disposition. This disposition may be quite whole- 
some or it may be highly undesirable for his own 
well-being and that of others, 
The second practical point is to produce in the 
youth a thoughtful attitude toward these changes, 
in order that his own help may be enlisted in round- 
ing him out into efficient manhood. If unpleasant 
or harmful dispositions emerge, he must find in his 
adult associates sympathy and help rather than con- 
demnation. Although he may not be wholly re- 
sponsible for the attitudes and moods that develop 
now, he must be led to see that he is largely re- 
sponsible for their continuance. He must feel that 
now more than ever before he can take a direct hand 
in his own development. His own intense self- 
consciousness and eagerness to be somebody, to real- 
ize ideals, is the natural soil in which to plant the 
seeds of self-control. He can learn to interpret his 
moods as passing phases which are not to be allowed 
to fix themselves on him unless they have real worth 
for meeting life’s problems. He can learn to see 
that he will have no finer test for his courage and 
his ability than to face and overcome dispositions 
which will interfere with his struggle for those fine 
ideals which now grip him with such force. Even 
the “bad boy” has his wholesome adolescent ideals. 
His badness consists, not so much in his purposes, 
as in his failure to get himself properly lined up 
to fight for them effectively. In facing untoward 
circumstances “the youth usually plays the stoic.
-P-A-G-E-146

  118 ae HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
He feels a savage pride in the thought that circum- 
stances can never rob him of his integrity, or bring 
his best self to be dependent on mere change of 
fortune.” (2) 
This courage to face the world, however harsh 
its aspect may be, is the courage he must learn to 
Help from bring into play as he faces him- 
older people self. The mechanics, so to speak, 
of self-management he can appreciate now as the 
little boy could not. Through conversations with 
older people who understand the peculiar problems 
of this age, through the study of the lives of men 
who have been truly efficient in meeting the needs 
of their times, through association with teachers 
and other adults who have plenty of wholesome 
interests in the work of the world, he should gain 
the idea that self-control has two sides; it consists, 
not alone in checking bad impulses, but in actively 
cultivating those attitudes which he can now see 
have such an important bearing on his future suc- 
cess. 
The value of the sympathetic friendship of older 
people, especially teachers, is well illustrated in the 
following chapter, “The High- 
School Period in Retrospect.” 
Friendships among young people themselves are 
also full of significance. What a recent writer and 
keen observer of youth says of the girl is also very 
largely true of the boy. She writes: 
“The social side of the girl reveals itself not Help of friends 
1

only in the desire to have a good time, but in the 
deep and ardent friendships 
formed during the teen period. 
While she enjoys to the full the society of the 
group, the girl in her teens invariably has a ‘dear- 
est friend, who shares her joys and sorrows and 
confidences. This tendency becomes especially evi- : 
dent at sixteen,” and later. | 
“These friendships may be the source of greatest 
blessings or may mean the lowering of the whole 
tone of her moral life. Both mother and teacher 
need to observe carefully the formation of friend- 
ships and be sure to encourage only the helpful 
ones. Public school teachers of experience can all 
testify to the rapid changes in girls which so often 
follow the development of a deep friendship. 
“T remember a girl of sixteen, dreamy, imagi- 
native, and so much interested in her boy compan- 
ions that lessons, home interests, and everything 
else were sacrificed. What to do with her and what 
interests to substitute were questions that both 
mother and teacher failed to solve. At a most op- 
portune time a ‘new girl’ moved into the neighbor- 
hood and entered school. She was practical, at- 
tractive, a good scholar, greatly interested in out- 
door athletics.” A friendship sprang up between 
the two girls. “Soon the dreamy sixteen-year-old 
was playing tennis on summer afternoons, and 
reading aloud in the hammock afterward to rest. 
When winter came she suddenly decided that school An illustration

and study were worth while, brought up all her 
averages and made up her mind to try for college. 
Skating and the gymnasium made her a new girl. 
And i this transformation, fortunately for her 
good, came naturally and very rapidly through the 
influence of her companion. It comes almost as 
quickly in the other direction. Nothing can be 
more helpful to the shy, timid, self-conscious girl 
than the companionship of one who will encourage 
her and help her to take her place with others in 
the social life of which she is a part.” (3) 
The preceding pages should give the reader a 
proper background for the consideration of the 
A cuddle duder- moral education problem in high 
tunity Mir inpeal school. These years, with their 
training development of a new selfhood, 
with their impulse for life and action, with their 
appreciations of friendship and their susceptibility 
to social influences and, withal, their devotion to 
“cane and their impulse to serve, are surely the 
years above all others for moral training. 
May we be allowed to quote Miss Addams again? 
These word of hers set the matter in the light in 
which we believe it should always be approached 
in the high school. 
“It would seem a golden opportunity for those 
to whom is committed the task of spiritual in- 
struction, for to preach and seek justice in human 
affairs is one of the oldest obligations of religion 
 
-P-A-G-E-149

CHARACTERISTIC PHASES 121 
and morality, All that would be necessary would 
be to attach this teaching to the contemporary world 
in such wise that the eager youth might feel a tug 
upon his faculties, and a sense of participation in 
the moral life about him... . 
“Each generation of moralists and educators find 
themselves facing an inevitable dilemma; first, to 
keep the young committed to their charge ‘unspotted 
from the world,’ and, second, to connect the young 
with the ruthless and materialistic world all about 
them in such wise that they may make it the arena 
for their spiritual endeavor. It is fortunate for 
those teachers that some time during ‘The Golden 
Age’ the most prosaic youth is seized by a new in- 
terest in remote and universal ends, and that if but 
given a clue by which he may connect his lofty aims 
with his daily being, he himself will drag the very 
heavens into the most sordid tenement. The per- 
petual difficulty consists in finding the clue for him 
and placing it in his hands, for if the teaching is 
too detached from life, it does not result in any 
psychic impulsion at all.” (1) 
The opportunity of these years for wise moral 
training is as yet largely neglected. What is needed 
An opportunity is something more than mere “in- 
largely neglected cidental instruction” or “whole- 
some school atmosphere.” The youth needs to be 
led to think about questions of conduct. In fact, 
he does think about them, but unless his thinking is  
-P-A-G-E-150
  122 THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
guided it will often go astray. The purpose of ex- 
plicit moral training in the high school should be 
to cultivate a sound moral thoughtfulness about the 
various concrete situations which present them- 
selves to modern high-school boys and girls. Peo- 
ple co versant with the morals of the high school 
tell us they are pitched on a most discouragingly 
low plane. Theft, dishonesty in connection with 
studies and athletics, and still worse forms of so- 
cial and personal immorality prevail to an alarming 
degree. (4) Is it because the adolescent is by na- 
ture immoral? ‘This can hardly be, for such a con- 
cision would run counter to all our previous dis- 
cussion, and is disproved by the high standards of 
conduct maintained by boys in English secondary 
schools. No, the fault is largely due to neglect on 
the part of the school to give the training needed, 
a training which we believe the boys and girls in 
their teens are quite ready to receive. 
This is not the place to discuss suitable methods 
of moral training. We can only refer the reader

and applied in a few of our schools. It is care- 
fully adjusted to the interests and general point of 
view “ the teens and, if faithfully followed, would, 
we believe, do much toward filling the present se- 
rious gap in the training of the adolescent in the 
American high school. We refer to the course of

moral instruction developed by Sharp and Neu- 
mann, and published in outline in a recent number 
of Religious Education. (5), 
High-school life is replete not only with oppor- 
tunities for direct and wholesome moral instruction, 
Opportunitiesfor but also with opportunities for ex- 
social service perience in right living in the 
broadest sense of that term, and this latter phase is 
quite as important as the preceding. Every high 
school which seeks the best for its youths must aim 
to develop all sorts of opportunities for social mor- 
ality within and without the school. Many high 
schools have shown that it is possible for their 
pupils to participate in various forms of social serv- 
ice to the community. Such opportunities are, if 
rightly presented, usually embraced by the pupils, 
young reformers and missionaries as they are, with 
an eagerness that is almost disconcerting.

ROM time to time the writer of these pages 
has collected from his students reminiscences 
of their high-school experiences. These students 
Reminiscences of Were asked to describe any inci- 
high-school life = dents or phases of their high- 
school life which they felt might be worth their 
remembering when they themselves entered such 
schools as teachers. It was suggested to them that 
these reminiscences might be of any sort, such as 
their own personal attitudes, interests and aims, dis- 
tinctive mental or emotional traits, their relations 
to their studies, their teachers, and any aspects of 
the general social life of the school which, in look- 
ing back, seemed significant as pointing out either 
what they themselves should do or avoid doing as 
high-school teachers. 
It should surely be of some value to teachers to 
know what sort of lasting impressions their pupils 
Value of such carry away with them into later 
a record years. A record of such impres- 
sions, even though it be naive, should throw some 
light on the human nature of real high-school boys

and girls. Any attempt to paint a general picture 
of the mental life of the teens is apt to exaggerate 
the high ights. If there is any possibility that the 
preceding pages have described extreme and un- 
usual wp the accounts which follow will furnish 
a certain corrective; will picture what some have 
liked to call the “real high-school student.” 
The o jection that these records are from a se- 
lected group of high-school students, those who 
have gone to college, and who are, therefore, not 
fairly representative, is not well-founded. The 
only way in which these students are probably 
diver from the larger class who have not con- 
tinued in school is in their possibly greater ability 
to give a better introspective account of the ex- 
eT of the years just past than those who 
have not had the further training in scholastic 
work, 
The experiences of high-school life mentioned by 
these students are probably, then, quite character- 
istic of al high-school pupils; the difficulties, in 
fact, would be quite as keenly felt, if not more so, 
by those who failed to overcome them and continue 
their work in higher schools. Indeed the student 
who has successfully completed his high-school 
course and has gone on to college would be less 
likely to emphasize the difficulties of the high school 
than those who had spent only a year or more in 
school « Tis stopped with the completion of the 
four-year course.

These are essentially human documents. It 
would be futile to try to summarize them and to 
Range of in- state percentages, and yet the quo- 
dividuality tations show with entire fairness 
the attitudes of these students toward their high- 
school life. The first impression one gets in read- 
ing them is the wide range of individuality repre- 
sented by their writers. There is every variety 
from the phlegmatic, unemotional student who can 
think of nothing in particular, to the intense emo- 
tional type, whose high-school life was richly col- 
ored by “experiences which he will never forget.” 
This very diversity of types is in itself a significant 
fact for the teachers of boys and girls in their teens 
to bear constantly in mind. 
To many a pupil, the high school opens as a new 
world of mysterious possibilities. This attitude of 
eager anticipation is well ex- High schoola 
new world to pressed by one student, who says: 
Pome pupils “I can still feel the thrill of ex- 
pectancy with which, for example, I entered upon 
the study of Latin. The teacher was the guide. 
She knew Latin land, and we were eager to fol- 
low her through that delightful country. My 
English work was not a gray monotony of themes. 
It was colored with the purple of imagination.” 
“It was the greatest event of my life when I 
entered the pa a freshman.” 
And yet the transition is , affected with 
difficulty. Another says: “It! was with a great

Difficulties £ | deal of pleasure that I looked for- 
entering | . ward to my entrance into the 
high school. Why I was going I never seriously 
considered; I just took it for granted, as did my 
parents, that I should go through. But my real 
entrance was far different from what I had pictured 
it to be " my mind. In the grades, there had al- 128 
  ways been a congenial, home-like atmosphere which 
completely dominated everything; but in the high 
school I came face to face with an absolutely differ- 
ent coon and many a time during my first 
year’s work I wished I were back in that ‘dear’ old 
grammar school which I had learned to love and 
to sespect. f 
Another writes: “After having been the im- 
portant ‘N class of the last grade in grammar 
school it seemed strange to find ourselves sub- 
merged in a larger group in high school. One 
especial ily was the getting accustomed to 
having different teachers for every subject, the 
getting acquainted with the teachers and the fear 
that they might not like us. 
“T looked upon everything at that dake as being 
big. The teachers seemed to me as being very

awe of them, Then, I felt there was not that close 
relationship between pupil and teacher as there had 
been in the lower glades. If the teachers were not 
always kind and oa with me, I een to dislike
-P-A-G-E-157
  IN RETROSPECT 12G 
them. Sometimes I thought the teachers were not 
very religious, because they scolded when I thought 
they ought to be kind and helpful. 
“But when I came to my sophomore year, I 
looked upon things differently and partly overcame 
this feeling of awe and timidness. I had more con- 
fidence in myself and no longer felt that my high- 
school mates were any bigger than myself. More- 
over I realized that the instructors were not so 
distant after all, for on several occasions both in 
lessons and programs were we thrown together, 
and each time the instructors put forth great effort 
to show their personal interest in us.” 
“The individual was a minus quantity; he was 
completely submerged. The personal touch be- 
tween teachers and pupils to which I referred lasted 
only during the first year, and then it completely 
vanished. The methods of instruction were, with 
one exception, purely mechanical, and the teachers 
never attempted to make the work really practical. 
Interest in school, in life, in activities, in everything 
was far below par and nothing was ever done to 
stimulate the individual.” 
“In spite of the difficulty of adjustment when 
entering the high school, I felt a renewed interest 
in school work. The increased field of work, to- 
gether with the less close supervision, made me feel 
more independence, more responsibility, in regard 
to that work. This may have been due to the at- 
titude of my first high-school teachers, which was
-P-A-G-E-158
    130 THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
one of sy npathy and of interest in the individual 
rather than the subject.” 
Another says: “One thing which stands out up- 
permost in my mind was the lack of interest on 
the part of the teachers in helping the pupil in se- 
lecting his course of study.” 
It is not strange that so many memories of high- 
school days center around the relation of teacher to 
Susceptibility pupil. Such comments as these 
to teacher's which follow are full of sug- 
personality gestion. Probably at no time of 
life is a person more subject to the stimulating or 
depressing influence of other personalities than in 
high school. No one can read these paragraphs 
without feeling that the question of efficiency in 
the hig’ school is intimately bound up with the 
personality of the teacher. 
“The commercial teacher was a very small man, 
but we were afraid of him. Everything was silent 
the minute he came into the room. He was inter- 
ested in his work and was not satisfied if we were 
not doing excellent work. We had to do it well 
and we worked hard for him. In my sophomore 
year there was a change in instructors. The com- 
mercial eacher was a joke, he was a bluffer, but 
he didn’t seem to know that we knew it. Another 
professor was very indifferent to his work and so 
were we. He was impatient and cross. It really 
seemed irr he was simply teaching for the money 
there was in it.”

“It seems to me, as I recall my freshman and 
sophomore years in high school, that this is the 
period when violent likes or dislikes are taken to 
instructors. I remember one teacher whom I dearly 
loved, and I was so afraid that she did not like 
“T always did my best work for the teacher who 
made me do my work, for the teacher that I was 
afraid of. I would study hours for some instruct- 
ors rather than be criticized or scolded, 
“I was fond of our superintendent. He seemed 
to understand us; would talk us out of things; 
The“understand- Would not scold unless we needed

terested in every one. On the other hand, a lady 
instructor was always scolding; was cross and un- 
reasonable. We got so we would laugh at any- 
thing she said. She treated us just like primary 
children. She was not attractive and had very poor 
taste. She wore a bright red tailored suit with a 
light blue hat. She also had a knitted scarf of all 
the colors of the rainbow. We called her ‘Old 
Glory’ whenever she wore the red and blue com- 
bination.” 
“Tt was always the kind and sympathetic teachers 
for whom I would try and work the hardest and 
in whose classes I did the best work. More can 
always be accomplished by teachers of this sort than 
by the ones who seem to take no interest in the 
pupil.”

THE HIGH-SCHOO AGE 
“As I have mentioned before, Bieta was a cer- 
tain hi cre teacher whom I respected and 
looked up to as a model of perfection. She made 
me unconsciously take a greater interest in my work 
and heed me build up ideals which I still retain.” 
“The influence of some of these teachers will 
have a lasting effect upon my life, and I am sure 
there are many others who will say the same. I 
well remember the little woman who, for three 
years, occupied the principal’s chair. Small in 
stature b t mighty in moral principle. It was she 
who set the standard for right doing and good class 
work, and refused to give approbation for those 
who remained below it.” 
“He was severe in his requirements, but always 
just and always courteous—he treated us like young 
men and young women. I would go out of my way 
many blocks just in order to meet him and hear him 
say, ‘How do you do, Miss . IT treasured in 
my heart for a long time his last words to me: ‘I’m 
sure I do not see how you could have done better 
than you have; I shall expect to hear great things 
of you.’ I finished my course in a district school 
almost without regret at the change, because he 
and another favorite teacher were not coming back 
the next year.” 
“During my freshman and sophomore years I 
liked all my teachers and was in love with two of 
the young lady teachers, just out of college. We 
used to show our devotion by bringing them     
     
-P-A-G-E-161
IN RETROSPECT 133 
flowers, fruits and various presents and hanging 
around their rooms to talk with them. In my 
junior and senior years I did not like my teachers 
as well. I got to thinking that one of them had 
taken a dislike to me and there seemed to be a lack 
of understanding between us.” 
“Tt is interesting, also, to note the opinions we 
entertained of the various teachers. We did not 
stop then to consider why we liked some and dis- 
liked others, but our feelings were strong in some 
cases and, of course, affected our work, One 
science teacher spoiled his influence with his second 
year pupils by treating them as ‘grown-ups.’ He 
started out by addressing them as ‘Miss’ and ‘Mr.’ 
He seldom knew our names outside the class room. 
His whole attitude was distant. At the same time 
there was a mathematics teacher who treated us as 
small children. 
“The next superintendent, however, appealed to 
us differently. He seemed made of the same ma- 
terial as we were, and met all of his pupils on an 
equal basis. The rich and the poor were alike with 
him. I remember when I enrolled under him, I 
wanted to take some subjects over, as I felt I had 
not done as well in them as I should. After look- 
ing up my record, he turned to me and advised me 
not to do so, saying that he thought I could handle 
the advanced work without difficulty. That, I 
think, determined my career, for had I been allowed 
4o take those subjects over, I should never have

  ont the high school. But through his advice 
I felt encouraged, and he awakened a feeling I in me 
that I could Teuepliah what I wanted to, provided 
I tried. I had many other teachers, some of them 
teaching me more by their actions ven they did by 
their words.” 
“How we disliked him, feared him, disrespected 
him! Then there was another who seemed to give 
all her thoughts to dress. We always admired her 
clothes, yet felt that they were out of place in the 
schoolroom. She did not mix with the common 
teachers or pupils, and it was not long before we 
classified her as a snob. ... 
“But the pupils as well 2 as the lgachers had traits 
of both kinds. The majority of us could have been

teachers on pu- always made us feel that they 
were watching us, and that we 
were not a part of the governing body. I think 
perhaps this was the weakest point in our school. 
We whispered and played tricks whenever we could, 
and felt as if it were all right, if we were not caught 
in the act. This, it seems to me, would have been 
different had we realized that all the discipline did 
not rest with the instructors.” 
“My conduct in high school seemed to be greatly 
influenced by the teacher who happened at the mo- 
ment to be in charge. One teacher was an object | 
of particular dislike. She was extremely disagree- 
able and impatient and in all of our tests, watched 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
IN RETROSPECT 135 
us with cat-like care in an effort to detect cheat- 
ing. Our chief aim was to outwit her and we 
never thought of the dishonor involved in cheat- 
ing, but merely felt delight in the fact that we had 
escaped the detection of the despised instructor. In 
direct contrast to her, was a teacher who acted as 
though the possibility of our being dishonest had 
never occurred to him and I remember but one 
person who was ever dishonest in his classes.” 
“T didn’t like the teachers because they were such 
important beings. These teachers were from the 
best families of the city and were merely teaching 
for want of something better to do until they were 
married. They would not speak to me, an insig- 
nificant, poor country boy, except in the class room 
and then I was so scared that many a time I could 
say nothing and consequently got a zero for that 
day’s work, There was a vacancy in the teaching 
force after my freshman year and a poor, but 
beautiful young woman was called to fill this va- 
cancy. She was the idol of my heart because she 
treated us all alike and would talk to and advise me 
about anything I wanted advice about. Many an 
evening have I stayed to see if I could help her. 
There was no wall between her and her pupils. I 
would do anything for her. From this time on, I 
liked to go to school.” 
“The discipline stood out strongly in that school. 
The superintendent was one of those born over- 
seers. His only mile was ‘do right,’ but this was

sufficient for him, for his very gait ea expression 
demanded obedience and through it all he ever had 
the good will and highest respect and esteem of 
his pupils. I always felt a strong liking for all of 
my instructors while in high school. I had but one 
teacher that I did not care for and really disliked. 
She was one of those persons who never smiled; 
who never saw a funny side to anything. I never 
knew that teacher to laugh heartily with the class. 
To be sure the recitation is not to be converted into 
a laughing bee, but I believe there are times when 
a goo fede will do more good than anything 
else.” 
“The teacher who appealed most strongly to me 
was a quiet, unassuming woman who always en- 
Conceptions of tered the schoolroom with a 
the ideal rer happy smile and a cheery ‘Good 
morning.’ She seemed glad to be there and glad to 
see the children. She was quiet and calm in all 
her movements; her voice was low and pleasant 
and the pupils learned to be quiet and attentive when 
she spoke. i all her commands she was kind yet   determined. In this way she soon won the respect 
and fe of all her pupils. She would go to almost 
any amount of trouble to help a child out of a diffi- 
culty. Her explanations were clear and concise. 
She knew how to make herself understood. More 
than all, she was absolutely impartial, and this con- 
tributed much toward making her a real friend and 
companion of each child. |    
-P-A-G-E-165

“A teacher who did not appeal to me was an 
irritable, quick-tempered woman. She moved nerv- 
ously about the room and had a loud shrill voice. 
She could be heard distinctly some distance from 
the room. In her presence the children moved 
about carelessly and noisily; their voices were often 
loud and harsh. She seldom smiled and never, I 
think, greeted the children as they came in the 
morning. She acted as if she were troubled and 
irritated by the children. She was continually nag- 
ging them and often punished them for slight of- 
fenses. She was very partial to some of her pupils 
and ignored others who were not especially forward 
in their manner. She never troubled herself to help 
a pupil over a hard point. He must either get the 
help of an older pupil or go on with his difficulty 
unsolved.” 
“My best teacher was always fair and just, both 
in regard to our work in class and our conduct in 
assembly room. She was kind when we tried and 
made mistakes and never discouraged us by sar- 
casm (a fault very common to teachers, I think) ; 
she was always tastefully dressed both in school 
and for outside affairs. All of these characteristics 
along with her ever-readiness to help and encourage 
in everything that concerned us made her a sort of 
model for all of us. We used to say, ‘When I grow 
up, I am going to be just like Miss L.’ ” 
“The high-school teacher who stands out most 
prominently in my mind is not the one who taught

with the greatest success nor the one who ‘seemed to 
have the best education; but rather the one who 
gave us all she had of sympathy and nae Her 
subject was English, but she taught us more of 
humanity than of language forms. There was a 
depth and breadth about her that went far toward 
giving the boys an interest in school life.” 
“The teacher who appealed to me most was very 
thorough in her work. She had a quiet and pleas- 
ing way about her. She was firm in discipline and 
respected by all the pupils, but at the same time her 
bearing was not unduly forward. Her attitude 
toward her class was very cordial and sympathetic 
and it i fodcht forth the very best efforts from the 
pupils. She had a remarkably even temper and 
very seldom Ladinda irritated or cross. Outside of 
the schoolroom she was able to come down to the 
level of the pupils and become one of them without 
their taking any advantage of her. She was jolly 
and TE Tabte and took a personal interest in all 
of us and, above all, she was a woman of high 
ideals.” | 
“The he of my high-school days who ap- 
pealed to me most was the principal, under whom 
I worked rt entire four years. The quality that 
impressed most was his ability to maintain dis- 
cipline. The school was not an easy one to handle 
and yet he always had good order, not merely in 
his own ee but throughout the whole school. 
To wir order he did not rely on a system

of petty and irritating rules and precepts, but al- 
lowed to the pupils every advantage and liberty 
possible. 
“This principal also impressed me with his power 
as a teacher. He taught me history and mathe- 
matics and in such a way that I still take a great 
interest in both subjects. He understood his work 
and left a clear and definite idea of what he taught © 
in the pupils’ minds.” 
The reader will remember that the above para- 
graphs are furnished by students who have been 
High-school pu- Ot of high school three or four pils'conceptions —_ years. It will be interesting to Gfagood teacher compare these estimates of teach- ers with some made by pupils who are yet in high 
school. About four hundred pupils in a single city 
high school were recently asked by their English 
teachers to write brief descriptions of their ideal 
of a high-school teacher. From such quotations 
as follow, and they are entirely typical, it is quite 
clear that pupils are interested in their teachers 
while they are working under them, that the anal- 
yses of effective teachers, given on the preceding 
pages, are not afterthoughts of more mature years 
but are quite genuine presentations of views held 
by pupils actually in high school. 
“T have just had a teacher who is, I believe, the 
best that can be found anywhere. When outside of 
school she did not act as if she were far above 
the pupils, but mingled with them as if she were 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
one of (them T think it was on account of this 
that she had such good control over her pupils. In 
her study periods she very seldom spoke a word 
and yet things were so quiet that Th ula hear 
a pin drop, while the teacher in charge just before 
her would walk up and down the room or shout 
at us and just the minute his back was turned, bang! 
would go an eraser against the wall. In all my 
two years’ work under her, I never once saw her 
lose her temper. If she asked a pupil a question 
and he did not answer rightly, she did not ‘snap’ 
him off quickly and call on some one else but talked 
to him and tried to find out on what grounds he 
based. his hea. (Boy) 
“A successful high-school teacher ites have a 
thorough knowledge of his subject and a genuine 
understanding of his pupils. Of course the char- 
acter and personal appearance of the teacher have 
much to do with his effectiveness. He should be 
good-natured, patient and earnest in his attitude 
before his class. His efforts will be materially 
aided by a well-kept personal appearance and by a 
pleasant and cheerful countenance. He must, in 
dave to the good qualities common to most peo- 
ple, possess good morals and good 08 and finally 
he must have peculiar skill in presenting his subject 
in an interesting way before his classes.” (Boy) 
“My ideal high-school teacher is one who treats 
all the pupils alike; who explains clearly all that is 
not understood by the class. If a na comes 
     
-P-A-G-E-169
  
IN RETROSPECT 141 
to class without his lesson, he should be kind and 
yet stern without getting angry. The pupil will 
then try harder next time.” (Boy) 
“My ideal teacher is a young lady of very cheer- 
ful disposition and quite nice looking. She is strict 
and yet not cross, and does not always wear a 
frown or look as though she were mourning over 
somebody. If a pupil makes a mistake, she will 
not ‘bawl him out’ like most teachers, but will tell 
him after class he will have to study harder. She 
is not the least bit sarcastic, and has a very good 
sense of humor. If something funny happens to 
be said, she will laugh. None of her children will 
ever accuse her of being partial or of having favor- 
ites.” (Boy) 
“An ideal high-school teacher should have a 
natural aptitude for making the pupils understand 
the subject taught and she should not talk over 
their heads. Nor should she do all the talking. The 
pupils should like to come to her room. She should 
be firm as well as pleasant and should expect the 
pupils to do what they are told to do. She should 
not lose her temper, for by doing so she loses the 
respect of the pupils. When she reproves a pupil, 
she should be sure she is reproving the right person 
for the right thing.” 
“The ideal teachers, as a usual thing, are not very 
olentiful, for teachers are not made to order. If 
it were only possible to have one who disbelieved 
in sarcasm and who would encourage instead of dis-

courage the students! e avera: e boy or girl is 
afraid of a teacher who corrects every slightest 
mistake with a sarcastic remark. If such a teacher 
only ber how little good this does and the kind 
of a reputation she is making for herself, she would 
try a new method.” (Boy) | 
“Some teachers, when they call upon you, act 
as though they were daring you to make a mistake, 
and glare at you until you forget the answer, even 
if you knew it at first. Other teachers look at you 
as though they expected you to recite. | This makes 
you feel like attempting it.” (Girl) 
“No teacher should show partiality toward any 
pupil.” (Girl) 
“My ideal of a high-school teacher is one whose 
very soul is in her work and yet who does not ap- 
pear all-absorbed by her teaching; a teacher who 
comes to the class room free from that overbearing 
manner sometimes assumed e+ officio; a teacher 
who laughs and laughs as though she means _ 
(Girl) 
“Perhaps I demand too much of my ideal, but 
I have already known several teachers who have 
very et come up to it. I have especially in 
mind my language teacher; she is of the patient 
jolly type whom everybody likes. She is never 
cross, although the ‘shirks’ learn to fear the time 
when they answer, ‘I don’t know.’ Some of the 
most uncomfortable moments of my life have been 
spent after I have ‘flunked’ in her class, my guilty

conscience aroused by her gentle rebuke. In gen- 
eral, I like her because of her patience, her teady 
sense of humor and her continual holding up of 
an authority to which we are willing to submit.” 
(Girl) 
“T think a teacher should be patient and answer 
questions asked by students in a pleasant way, in- 
stead of saying, ‘Well! if you can’t see an easy 
thing like that, I won’t tell you.’ ” (Girl) 
“Probably the position of high-school teachers 
is a trying one and the pupils may misunderstand 
them at times when they are very tired or have had 
a difficult time with some one who does not seem to care to learn.”

good teacher, possibly far more than their teachers 
give them credit for doing. It should be an in-

certain qualities are regarded, such as indly sym- 
pathy, appreciation of the pupil’s point of view, 
“square dealing,” ability to teach and to make points 
clear, “ts of humor and so forth. One has a feel-

suggestion from the opposite quality which he sees 
most frequently in actual school life. This is espe- 
cially the case when it comes to mentioning “sense 
of humor” as one of the characteristics of the suc- 
cessful teacher. 
Both the reminiscences and the words quoted 
from present high-school pupils confirm statements 
made in earlier chapters as to the extreme sensi- 
tiveness of adolescents to the influence of older 
people about them. They respond to those who 
show a personal interest in them, provided this in- 
terest is shown in a dignified and genuine fashion. 
They dislike teachers who hold aloof, teachers with 
mannerisms, teachers who assume attitudes, and 
who lack poise and patience. 
These are only a few of the comments that are 
suggested by this material. Every teacher or pros- 
pective teacher will find here many suggestions for 
better adapting himself to the needs of these sen- 
sitive and idealistic years. 
That the high-school years are an important 
transition period almost all these students admit, 
although with some the changes 
were so gradual that they were 
quite unnoticed. Thus: “My high-school years 
were not marked by any ‘storm and stress,’ but by 
a pleasant, profitable, gradual growth.” 
“I had no sudden changes in emotional, in in- 
tellectual or social attitudes and my hopes and as- 
pirations were those of the ordinary girl.” Transition years
-P-A-G-E-174
      
  THE mc eae} A Eo 
‘T can not reca c any changes of dished which 
took place de my high-school career. I had 
a moderate interest in social affairs, for I enjoyed 
dancing and going to parties, ‘but I was also ex- 
tremely fond of my home.” 
“The childish desires were put aside and I was 
compelled to think and act as a woman. The dolls 
were banished along with the other liythings, and, 
worst cf all, the younger playmates. Under these 
circumstances there was a decided change in my 
temperament. As a little girl I was happy and 
care-free and had a sunny disposition (if such a 
term is permissible), always looking on the bright 
side of things. 
“The ‘New Life,’ as Daniels terms this transition 
period, ‘brought care, responsibility and unhappi- 
ness to me. I became morbid and felt that no one 
quite understood me. Then came the idea of the 
dual personality. After seeing Doctor Jekyll and 
Mr. Hyde on the stage, I decided the easiest way 
to get along in the world would be to let the people 
who insisted on misunderstanding my ideas and 
actions do so and I would keep ‘the other self’ to 
myself. The result was almost disastrous to my 
friendships. To all appearances I was cold and 
nen to other people and their affairs and be- 
came very self-centered. My mother and I grew 
farther and farther apart as I confided less i in her. 
If I was misjudged, I would let such judgment 
        
 
-P-A-G-E-175
   IN RETROSPECT 147 
stand and inwardly played the part of a martyr. 
However, I had very high, unattainable ideals. My 
ambition was to be very kind to other people, a 
philanthropic sort of an individual always doing 
things in a quiet, unassuming way. ‘These ideals 
were aided by one of my high-school teachers. I 
was decidedly introspective, I had a firm belief that 
no one had as serious thoughts as I concerning the 
problem of life. . . . After this emotional ex- 
perience I became more morbid than ever and more 
serious too. Eliot’s description of Maggie Tulliver 
more nearly expresses my feelings than anything 
that I have seen written. ‘There was a hopeless 
yearning for that something, whatever it might be, 
that was the greatest and best on earth.’ 
“I had my serious thoughts in regard to the fu- 
ture: Much time was spent in day-dreams. I 
realized that there was a lack of adjustment some- 
where and I longed for the time to come when I 
should be righted. Within the last year I have 
gradually acquired my childish attitude, which was 
optimistic. I can not explain how or why for sure, 
but I believe that it is in part the result of two 
friendships, one that of a woman, the other of a 
man. 
“I think now that my experiences in the adoles- 
cent period are similar to those of others, while at 
the time I was experiencing them, I was very certain 
no one else had ever felt so. I do believe, though,
-P-A-G-E-176
    that I was forced to take a ‘grown-up’ attitude 
toward life when a mere child and that, in part, 
caused the morbidness and too serious thinking.” 
“I became more particular in my a and sen~ 
sitive in the manner people spoke to and of me. 
When in the ninth and tenth grades I would do 
mostly anything the teacher asked me to do with- 
out questioning and saying anything about it; but 
later I became more independent.” 
“It was in my sophomore year that I first began 
to form any ideals and to plan for the future. I 
had always liked Latin and this 
year I had an excellent Latin 
teacher. I had always intended to go to Iowa, but 
up to this time it was merely a matter of saying 
‘Yes, I am going to college.’ But now I began to 
look at things differently. My greatest ambition 
was to wind in Latin and become a teacher like 
Miss K.” 
“I indulged in day-dreams quite as much as any 
one that our authors have described. I idealized Ideals 
Dreams of myself, my friends, my surround- 
great ings, and made them over to suit 
my fancy. y favorite theme for day-dreaming 
was to picture myself a star in public performances, 
when as a matter of fact the rdle was entirely out 
of my line of accomplishments. It was during my 
sophomore year that my attitude toward boys 
changed in a marked way. I became shy and re- 
strained in the company of the neighbor boy with 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
IN RETROSPECT 149 
whom I had grown up. He turned into a ‘Prince 
Charming’ before my very eyes. I imagined 
myself in love with him. I passed through a period 
of religious and spiritual budding-out, too, I am 
sure. In the grades I never knew why I went to 
Sunday school, and I never went to church at all 
then. But in the second year of the high school I 
began to think seriously about the welfare of my 
soul. I read the Bible through from cover to cover, 
not because it interested me immensely, but because 
I thought it was the thing to do.” 
“T developed a different attitude toward boys 
because of this new association with them. Pre- 
New attitude viously I had played with them 
toward the as with my girl friends and had 
Star saee looked upon them in the same 
light. Now, I endeavored to look my best in their 
company and I also felt a certain constraint around 
them and became more careful of my conduct. In 
various boys at various times, I felt a distinct in- 
terest, but I do not think that there was an element 
of affection in my attitude.” 
“My girl friends interested me most, and al- 
though I did not have many, those I did have were 
very intimate, and we enjoyed being with each 
other more than anything else.” 
“Tn my junior year we had a great many class 
parties and I first began to take an interest in boys. 
Before this I had not cared to be with them and 
thought that they always spoiled things,”
-P-A-G-E-178
    “I much preferred boys for playmates; girls with 
their dolls and playhouses seemed altogether too 
poky forme. My first month in high school brought 
about a sudden change in me. I began to feel a 
sort of embarrassment around my old playmates 
and took great pains with my personal appearance; 
most of all with my hair which hitherto had been 
an unknown care to me. My boisterous habits of 
the i summer ‘grated on my nerves,’ as it 
were, and I strove earnestly to replace them with 
the refined and pleasant manners of a teacher for 
whom I cared a great deal. My efforts to be a lady 
called forth many jeering, teasing remarks from 
my younger friends who had not yet come to realize 
‘the heavy burden of life’ as I had, and they made 
much fun of me because I refused to chew gum 
in school. i 
“The element of affection for the opposite sex 
entered into my nature about this time and cul- 
minated in my first ‘case’ some two months long 
in my high-school course. Under the very careful 
guidance of my mother this friendship brought out 
more womanly qualities in me than any other affair 
in my whole life.” | 
‘g ae studies in which I could ‘think things 
out’ and could see little value in simply memorizing 
Likedto “think things. I always did just enough 
things out” work in the studies that I dis- 
liked so that it would not bring down my average 
grades too much,” | 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  IN RETROSPECT 151 
The impulse to participate in the larger life out- 
side the school and the attendant uncertainty as to 
how to adjust one’s self to it, is illustrated in many 
of the papers collected. The following are char- 
acteristic statements: 
“The last few years in high school were char- 
acterized by a marked impatience to be out and 
Impatience with earning my own living. I had 
school restrictions always planned to teach and had 
mapped out a very brilliant career. Beginning in 
the country schools, I should rise by my own per- 
sonal effort. Occasionally the teaching profession 
would 'sse all its interest. In imagination I be- 
came at those times a very great singer, a social 
settlement worker, a nurse or a writer. I felt sure 
I could be successful in any of these callings, even 
though I had shown no talent along such lines. At 
times, I felt myself to be a most misunderstood 
person. For a year or more I had frequent attacks 
of the ‘blues.’ At these times I would cry, for 
what reason I could not say. I only knew I felt 
miserable and no one seemed to care.” 
“As far as having any vocational interests, I must 
say that I really did not have any until my last 
Vocational year in school. I had never 
interests looked forward beyond my school 
life. It came to me in a strange manner that the 
one who succeeded best was the one who had an 
aim in life. It happened, in the latter part of my 
senior year, that one of the girls gave a party to
-P-A-G-E-180
  
  our class. During the course of the evening the 
commie cane up as to what all the girls in- 
tended to do now that they were soon to graduate. 
Most of them were able to tell something; some 
want to fit themselves for teachers; others to do 
charity work, For the first time it then occurred to 
me that J should have an aim in life, other than 
merely going to school, From this time, I began 
to think and observe others, and finally concluded 
that the people who were interested in some special 
way ae the ones who were really happy or doing 
much good.” 
“When I entered high school, I expected to be a 
taal at some time. During my second year I 
attended a mission convention 
which so aroused my interest in 
missions, and my sympathy for my unfortunate 
fellow men in heathen lands, that I resolved to 
go ure, as soon as I should be prepared for 
the work of a missionary. The conviction was a 
deep one. I regarded it with such awe that I never 
talked | it with any one save fy nearest and best 
friends.” 
The following words of one student express 
clearly what many suggest as to the meaning of 
their high-school days: | 
clan an atmosphere as I have described I wall zeal 
lived my high-school days. I have forgotten New- 
Chief value of ton’s Law; I have forgotten 
, high aug Chaucer’s Prologue, but I never
-P-A-G-E-181

shall lose one thing, and that is the broad attitude : 
toward life which I gained in high school. It is 
all very well to emphasize the utilitarian value of 
a high-school education in these days of material- 
ism, but after all this value, I believe, is largely 
mythical, What I want to emphasize in this paper 
is the large vision and the grip on life that I gained 
then.” 
With this we shall bring our chapter to a close. 
Many phases of life in the high school have not 
been touched on; but to give a sample of everything 
would be scarcely possible within the limits of this 
book. 
Whether these reminiscences of high-school ex- 
periences are typical or not, those who know real 
boys and girls will have to judge for themselves.   Reference for further reading and study:

  CHAPTER X 
ECONOMIC RELATIONS AND SOCIAL INTERESTS OF 
HIGH-SCHOOL PUPILS 
Tir far, our attention has been confined to 
the mental and physical characteristics of 
adolescence in general and of the high-school pupil 
What arethechar- i particular. We turn in this 
tics ofhigh- and the following chapters to a 
tadents? ore specific study of the social 
relationships and habits of the high-school pupil. 
The general question before us is, what can be said 
of the character of the boys and girls who attend 
the American high school? Do they form a specific 
class which can be described in any particular or 
definite way? From what economic and social 
strata of the American public do they come? At 
what ages do they enter? What are their voca- 
tional interests, if any? What is their estimate of 
the value of a high-school course as measured by 
their intentions of finishing and by their conceptions 
of its relation to their life-work? In which studies 
are they most interested, at interested, and in 
which do most failures occur? How much time do 
they study outside of school via ; to what extent 
154   
 
-P-A-G-E-183
eta STIRS MR ye THOT Pe TP SEE Gy MERE Ee MG: Pe 
Ene RELATIONS 155 
do they work at home? Do they have opportunity 
to earn money outside; and in what ways do they 
earn money? How many evenings per week do 
they spend at home and how many parties, moving- 
picture shows and theaters do they attend per 
month? Answers to these questions would throw 
some light on the general character of the high- 
school population, which might be of much practical 
value to both teachers and parents. 
There is already in existence a considerable body 
of data on various points such as have been men- 
tioned above. Studies of particular groups of high- 
school children have been made and are being made 
which enable us to answer, in part at least, many 
of these questions. These studies have not, of 
course, been carried far enough to warrant our say- 
ing that the conclusions hold good for the entire 
country, but they show how information can be 
collected and the conclusions are certainly repre- 
sentative of large sections of the high-school popu- 
lation. 
First of all, what economic and social strata of 
the American people send their children to the pub- 
F lic high schools? The enormous ‘rom what eco- 
nomic andsocial growth in high-school attendance 
apes? during the last two decades sug- 
gests that the children can hardly be said to 
be any longer a selected group with interests 
and aptitudes which are much alike. Twenty 
years ago the children who came into the high
-P-A-G-E-184
   
    | | | a | | | 
THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
schools were probably such as had a particular 
inn in the more intellectual types of train- 
ing. Many of them were looking toward col- 
lege or higher professional courses when they had 
finished high school. They were, on the whole, 
children of American parentage, and from homes 
which appreciated the value of the somewhat nar- 
row nineteenth-century type of mental training. 
But the public high-school population has in- 
crease(l in these twenty years from 254,000 to 
Gieatiidbeheton || 1,105,000 (1892-1912). In con- 
of high-school nection with this increase in at- 
populawae tendance, the course of study has 
been much expanded. The high school is now often 
called the “People’s College.” The air is full of 
arguments that it should afford practical training. 
The influx of such large numbers of children of 
every race and condition of life has lent much 
weight to the demand that the high school should 
adapt itself to the great variety of needs represented 
and, as far as possible, train each child according 
to his particular bent, and somewhat definitely for 
his particular life-work. This, we say, is a perfectly 
natura consequence of the present situation when 
the high schools are supported by the people as a 
whole, rather than by some special class of people 
among whom intellectual interests possibly pre- 
dominate. } 
Van Denburg recently studied the racial, social 
and pe ha character of the homes of one thou- 
  
bi . i. i   
-P-A-G-E-185
ECONOMIC RELATIONS 15> 
Racial stocksin Sand boys and girls who entered 
the New York the high schools of New York 
eae etodls City at a given time. (1) He 
found most of the racial stocks in New York, 
twenty-three in all, represented in this group of 
children. Children of American parentage were 
present to the number of four hundred forty-six; 
the girls exceeding the boys almost two to one. 
The Hebrew races, on the other hand, were found 
to send more boys than girls; the ratio being about 
five to four. The Italians were also represented 
by more boys than girls, in the ratio of three to 
two. 
Taking into account the percentages of different 
races in the city as a whole and the percentage 
of each race represented in this high-school group, 
the Irish were found to be most poorly represented ; 
next above them were the Italians; the Hebrews 
were highest of all in proportion to their numbers 
in the city. Van Denburg concludes that this lat- 
ter race far exceeds all others, even the native born 
Americans, “in their appreciation and use of the 
New York high schools.” 
The rentals paid by the homes from which this 
group of one thousand children came showed to 
some extent the economic status 
; of the parents. The rentals were 
determined for only four hundred twenty of the 
group, but, of this number, one hundred fifty-four 
came from homes paying only fifteen dollars per Economic status

  ‘ i | i i | i Pa a TE [ HH 
ad ‘HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
and more than fifty per cent. were from 
homes paying from ten to twenty dollars per month. 
These figures indicate that 7 bulk of the homes 
represented were quite below the level of comfort- 
able circumstances; for eve: “twenty dollars per 
month will provide in New York City only a 
meagerly equipped apartment. 
The fathers’ employments showed to some ex- 
tent the social condition of these high-school pupils. 
Social is aitions It was found that, considering 
Tepresented the proportion of men in the city 
engaged in various vocations, the federal and city 
employees patronize the high schools in largest 
numbers; next come the parents engaged in the 
printing trades; third in the list are those classed 
as a. and semi-professional ; fourth are 
the office workers and agents; fifth are the artisan- 
contractors and manufacturers and tradesmen. This 
latter group sends to the high school nearly half 
of all the children who attend, but they rank fifth 
in their use of the schools because of the large 
number of this class in the aity ‘These conditions, 
discovered for New York City, may for the present 
be assumed to furnish a fair indication of the sit- 
uation in many other very large centers of popula- 
tion, west as well as east. There is no doubt but 
that all nationalities patronize the American high 
school, It is probable, however, that in the medium- 
sized high schools of the smaller western cities chil- 
dren are more largely in attendance from all eco-   
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  ECONOMIC RELATIONS 159 
nomic levels rather than so largely from the poorer 
ones as was found to be the case in New York. 
With reference to types of vocations represented 
in the Middle West a study was recently made by 
Comparison with the writer of one thousand one 
the Middle West hundred twenty-three pupils at- 
tending the high schools of three cities in Iowa, 
ranging from ten thousand to forty thousand in 
population. 
The following table presents the results of this 
study, together with Van Denburg’s figures for 
one thousand New York high-school pupils for 
comparison.

the artisans; and, in most cases, the differences 
noted may be easily explained, It is not surpris- 
ing, for instance, to find the agricultural class an 
important one in Iowa. Some of the other differ- 
ences, such as in the number of city and federal 
employees, those doing personal service, and those 
in the printing trades, suggests that the distribution 
of men in these various vocations is slightly differ- 
ent in the smaller western cities than in New York. 
But the fact that the children of men in profes- 
sional work are found more than two and one-half 
times as frequently in these schools as in New York 
indicates that the schools in this section are even 
more democratic than in the East. The profes- 
sional classes, quite as much as the humbler types 
of workers, see in the public high school a suitable 
place for the education of their children. 
The high-school pupils’ vocational intentions 
throw interesting light on the pupils themselves 
Vocatlabal in- and probably have something to 
tentionsofhigh- do with their persistence and suc- 
Sena eee cess in their high-school work. 
Van Denburg, in his study of the one thousand 
_ New York high-school pupils, found that forty-one 
per cent. of the boys and fifty-one per cent. of the 
girls were, on entering high school, either unde- 
cided as to their life-work or expressed no choice, 
which later may be considered as practically equiv- 
alent to being undecided. He found further, in cro the case of trade ba manufacture and
-P-A-G-E-189
ECONOMIC RELATIONS 161 
tracing the progress of these pupils through the 
following years, that they were much more likely 
to drop out of school early in their course than did 
those who had somewhat definite vocational plans. 
And of those who had such plans, those who had 
chosen careers necessitating high-school and college 
or professional school training, were more likely 
to remain and finish than those who had chosen, 
for example, business as a career. The actual fig- 
ures were as follows: At the end of two years 
of the high-school course, sixty-eight per cent. of 
the boys and sixty-one per cent. of the girls “who 
were uncertain as to their probable future occupa- 
tion had dropped out” of school, while sixty per 
cent. of the boys and fifty-five per cent. of the 
girls, irrespective of whether they had a future 
occupation in mind or not, had left school at the 
same time. “This would tend to show that the boy 
or girl, especially the boy, who has some definite 
occupation in mind lasts a trifle better than the 
boy with no such determination.” 
The variety of occupations chosen reveals. to 
some extent the breadth of outlook of these high- 
omarizon of school youths; forty different 
New York types of work were mentioned 
mane ne by the boys and twenty-one by 
the girls. Somewhat similar returns from eleven 
hundred and nine pupils in the three medium-sized 
high schools in Iowa reveal an even wider outlook 
among boys and girls in the central parts of the

Table VIII enumerates the different vocations 
chosen 
the nu by five or more pupils of either sex with 
nbers of New York pupils who also chose 
these vocations. Here again the general tendency 
is the ame, Teaching stands easily first with the 
girls in botlr the East and the West, and engineer- 
ing is likewise the favorite with the boys. Van 
Denburg accounts for the large choice of engineer- 
ing in ew York by the striking examples of great 
engineering enterprises which the boys see on every 
hand; the great bridges, tunnels, subways, railway 
terminals and lofty steel buildings. But an even 
larger number of Iowa boys have an interest in

ECONOMIC RELATIONS 163 
engineering; boys who can, at best, have only read 
about these modern engineering wonders. Does this 
not indicate that there is something inherently at- 
tractive to boy-nature in the engineering pursuits? 
Among the vocations mentioned by considerable 
numbers of Iowa girls but apparently not at all | 
by New York girls are nursing and domestic sci- | 
ence. Law and business are apparently about | 
equally attractive to both groups of boys; but the 
Iowa boys far exceed those of New York in their 
interest in medicine, and naturally also in farm- 
ing.*

*The basis on which the material from the Iowa schools 
was collected was not quite the same as that used by Van 
Denburg, hence the results are not strictly comparable. Van 
Denburg secured a report of vocational interests from pupils 
as they entered high school. Our reports are from pupils 
of all the high-school classes. The slightly more developed 
vocational interests of Iowa children are probably due to 
the inclusion of advanced classes.

Pupil’sestimate high-school work and the length of

length of stay of these one thousand children 
when they entered stated that they regarded a high- 
school education as necessary for their purposes in 
life; the rest answered that it was not necessary or 
that they were uncertain as to its value. In follow- 
ing the high-school histories of these pupils, it was 
found that the expectancy of staying in and com- 
pleting the course was much higher with those 
answering yes to both questions than with those 
answering no, or undecided. 
The following are the exact figures: 
50% of the boys who answer “yes” stay two years. 
50% of the girls who answer “yes” stay three years. 
50% of the boys and girls who answer “no” do not 
stay one year. 
In Iowa it was found that a goodly percentage of

168 | “THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE    
The differences between boys and. girls in regard 
to English, Latin and German is especially inter- 
Ditkerlbdes be. esting. Several questions arise in 
tween boys one’s mind. For example, is the 
and ee girls’ preference for these sub- 
jects due to the fact that the intrinsic quality, of the 
subjects makes more of an appeal to the girl-mind 
than to the boy-mind, or does the fact that these sub- 
jects are taught by women mean that they tend to be 
presented in ways better suited to arouse the girls’ 
interest than the boys’? Both of these factors prob- 
ably have their influence. On the other hand, boys 
surpass girls in their interest in mathematics, history 
and physical sciences, judged both by positive 
preference and by the much smaller numbers of 
boys who select these subjects as those in which 
they are least interested. From the small numbers 
of each sex who mention commercial subjects, man- 
ual training and domestic science as most interest- 
ing, we should judge, either that they are not 
largely elected or are not taught, thus far, so as to 
make a very definite appeal to children of the high- 
school age. Whether one or both of these condi- 
tions are true, it indicates that these so-called prac- 
tical and semi-vocational subjects do not thus far 
awaken the interest in the pupils of these cities that 
the older and better standardized subjects are able 
to do. f 
s to failures, the various mathematical subjects 
easily outrank all others. This may be due to less

difficult difficulty in the subjects or to too 
little willingness of large numbers of high-school

branches present. 
In connection with these figures regarding fail- 
ures which are based solely upon the pupils’ own re- 
Dita on failniea ports and which, therefore, are 
froma single subject to more or less error 
euco! (probably in most cases in the 
pupils’ favor) the following data are of interest.

  CHAPTER XI 
THE STUDY HABITS AND AMUSEMENTS OF HIGH- 
SCHOOL PUPILS 
HE questionnaire, which yielded the data 
OD heen in the preceding chapter for the four 
Iowa high schools, also called for a report from 
Hours of study each student as to the approx- 
outside of school imate number of hours spent in 
study outside of school hours. Practically all 
high-school officials agree in thinking that unless 
some provision is made in school for longer periods 
vf supervised study some outside study is both de- 
sirable and necessary, and this notwithstanding the 
arguments recently presented in certain popular 
magazines against home study. 
These pupils were asked to check the one from 
five estimates which most nearly represented the 
amount of time spent per week in home study. 
The following table gives the answers of four- 
teen hundred thirty-one pupils of these four schools.

Here, as in the answers to the ebdole questions, 
there is doubtless more or less inaccuracy with the 
probabilities lying on the side of an over- rather 
than an under-estimate. The correspondence in 
the times given by the students of the different 
schools is very striking and indicates that in spite 
of errors in individual cases these estimates repre- 
sent fairly the distribution of Iowa high-school 
pupils as to the amount of time spent in home study. 
Five to eight hours of home study per week is the 
most common report. Whether this is enough time 
for the average pupil, each high-school principal 
must judge for himself. It is, at any rate, of some 
importance in dealing with the high-school situation 
to know the actual distribution of our pupils in this 
matter of home study. 
It was thought that there might be some relation 
tena success in studies and amount of home 
Issuccessin stud. ‘Study. The reports of two hun- 
ies relatedtoout- dred forty-four Burlington pupils

grades were studied with this question in mind, but 
there was no relationship apparent from the data 
furnisited by the students. The results were as fol-

While there seems to be no relationship in terms. 
of mere failures, there is, no doubt, a relationship | 
in terms of the quality of work done if we but had } 
its measure in actual grades. This is a point on | 
which we must for the present defer a definite | 
answer. 
The pupils in these four Iowa schools reported 
themselves as spending entire evenings per week at 
home, as follows:

the week at home and the girls four acd five. Not 
many of us will feel that this report is altogether 
auspicious for the good of the high-school pupils. 
When the number of evenings per week spent at 
home falls below five on the average, one can not 
help but feel that home life and home influences are 
playing too little part in the lives of these adoles- 
cents. Fifty-nine per cent. spend four evenings or 
less at home.

Pupils reported as spending four to seven entire

ures per hundred pupils. 
Pupils reported as spending from none to three 
evenings per week at home average one hundred 
thirty-five failures per hundred pupils. 
A recent study of three hundred eighty delin- 
quent pupils in the Minneapolis high schools(1) 
revealed the fact that forty-six per cent. of them 
confessed that they were “out” the larger share of 
evenings in a week. No data were reported as to 
the home-staying habits of the pupils whose school 
work was up to grade, but in the light of the re- 
turns from the Iowa high schools it is fair to as- 
sume that there was a direct relation between the 
delinquency of those Minneapolis pupils and the 
little time they spend at home. 
The preceding information regarding these four- 
teen hundred pupils in the four Iowa high schools 
relates more or less directly to their school work 
and school interests. It might be interesting to

know, in connection with this, something of what 
these pupils are doing aside from their school work, 
whether they help at home, whether they earn 
money or not and the extent of their participation 
in certain forms of amusement. 
The following table gives the answers to the 
question—Do you have work at home? The data 
are given separately for each city 
in order to show how far there is 
any uniformity in this particular. ¢ Work at home

The fact that the girls slightly exceed the boys 
in helping with home work is natural in view of 
the sort of work that is usually available for chil- 
dren in city homes. It is encouraging for those 
who believe that children should learn to participate 
in home duties to note the large percentage of these 
pupils who report such participation. In the study 
just referred to, of three hundred eighty delinquent 
pupils i in the Minneapolis high schools it was found 
that the number who report home pros of any 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
    
STUDY AND AMUSEMENTS 177 
kind was much less. Whether, however, there is 
any general connection between lack of home work 
and delinquency is a subject demanding further in- 
vestigation before it can be definitely answered. It 
is natural to suppose that a complete absence of all 
responsibility at home might lead to an excess of 
outside activities which would interfere materially 
with school success. The only data from which we 
could infer the school standing of these Iowa pupils 
were the number of semester failures reported by 
each pupil, and there was no apparent relation be- 
tween these failures and home work or lack of it. 
The distribution of time spent at home work by 
these pupils was given by them as follows:

The question next arises—Do any of these pupils 
who do not work at home have work of some sort 
Numberwhoearn Outside of home? Some of these 
money outside do, but it happens quite as fre- 
oe quently that they do no work of 
any kind while those who report home work also 
quite as often report that they work outside also.

The considerable variety of work which high- 
school pupils in these cities find to do is significant. 
Heating oat While a number of these employ- 
venile occupa- ments would have to be classed as tions” problem ig eee : ay juvenile occupations,” and as not 
leading anywhere in particular, “a juvenile occu- 
pation” is not altogether to be condemned in these 
cases. When a boy or girl is in school, such a type 
of work, even though it does not lead directly to 
any future vocation, is a steadying influence upon 
the youngster, serving to give a little experience in 
personal responsibility and in the practical side of 
life. The experience of earning money for one’s 
self, even in a temporary employment, is a prepara- 
tion for future work that is decidedly worth while. 
It is hardly to be expected that many high-school 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
    pupils, with the best part of their day Liveei up to 
Degree Lely. school work, should find much 
tion beac out- time outside to spend in preparing 
ana TT for any particular vocation. And 
intra yet, out of the six hundred 
eighteen who report themselves as earning money, 
thirty-six or nearly six per cent. are doing outside 
work more or less directly related to what they are 
planning to do when they leave school. Table XXII 
shows just what these employments are.

  In view, however, of the present interest in vo- 
cational education, the question may be raised as to 
Shouldtherebea Whether the conditions here 
larger relation? = shown are as favorable for our 
high-school boys and girls as they should be. 
Should not the school and the community attempt 
to provide more opportunity for these pupils to get 
work which will minister more directly to their vo-
-P-A-G-E-209
STUDY AND AMUSEMENTS 181 
cational interests? As long as the school studies 
pursued by these pupils are so largely of the purely 
“liberal” or cultural type, there can, of course, be 
little relationship between school work itself and 
work outside. Furthermore, it must be recognized 
that many types of vocational interest, such as 
engineering, law, medicine or teaching, could not 
usually find any opportunity for expression during 
the school years. But there are also many interests 
which might find expression while the pupil is in 
school. To bring about such a connection, the 
school on its part would have to give more attention 
to cultivating the vocational interests of its pupils. 
With no special effort on the part of the school to 
cultivate such an intelligent insight into the diverse 
opportunities of the modern world, the range of 
interests already possessed by these Iowa pupils is 
comparatively limited, as we saw above in Table - 
VIII. If the school would undertake to enlighten 
its pupils systematically as to vocational opportuni- 
ties, if it would also provide more vocational studies 
and give more attention to the practical relation- 
ship involved in the ordinary studies, the pupil 
would be provided with a better basis on which to 
go out into his community and choose his work. 
But the community, also, should do something, 
perhaps under the leadership of the school. The 
Thecommunity’s modern community should be 
responsibility led to take a more direct interest
-P-A-G-E-210
  182 || | THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
in the Hdl of its children than is LLepresidt in 
simply providing them with the ordinary school op- 
portunities. People engaged in different lines of 
work should feel a responsibility for providing 
ways ze boys and girls who are inclined in various 
directions to gain a little experience in the work 
that interests them while they are going to school. 
The industrial schools have already begun to 
work out and apply various schemes of part-time 
employment for their pupils in the trades, but what 
we have in mind here is a more general and less 
intensive application of the idea. Not that the boy 
in the ordinary high school who wishes to work 
shall be employed in some trade, for example, on 
alternate weeks, but rather that opportunities shall 
be carefully developed in every community, whereby 
many such boys and even girls shall gain some slight 
contact with different vocations in their outside 
work. Such contact should give the youngster not 
merely a chance to make a little money, but also an 
se into, and practical appreciation of, the re- 
quirements of the vocation he wishes later to fol- 
low. | | 
As to the social and recreational interests of these 
fourteen hundred Iowa high-school pupils, the fol- 
lowing table summarizes the re- 
turns as to the number of parties, 
sl g-picture shows and theaters per month which 
they ele themselves as attending. The reports

As in the case of preceding tables the reader will 
have to interpret these figures for himself. Pos- 
sibly no one of these diversions, Is the time de- voted to these by itself, is indulged in by large 
diversions ex- numbers to excess, but taken to- cessive? 
gether they represent a consider- 
able expenditure of time in at least three forms of 
diversions. In most cases the pupil who goes to 
few or no parties does not indulge in the other 
forms of amusement. The general tendency is for 
all to be represented in speet the same proportion in 
the pupils who do participate at all. These figures 
will be taken by some as a proof of the statement 
often made that it is not the school work as such 
which is injurious to the health of the ordinary
-P-A-G-E-212
     ad HL mi but that he lefty most from the jouilt, 
plicity of his outside interests. 
In connection with the figures given above, the 
following words of Miss Slattery, regarding the 
ee Ad ibtibeeen girl in her teens, seem to strike 
outside interests  VETY nearly the truth of the mat- 
and “nery- ter. She writes: “So many of ousness’ f ‘ , : | our girls are ‘nervous.’ An eighth 
de teacher told me recently that she had fifty 
girls in her class and that according to their 
mothers, forty-one of them were ‘very nervous.’ It 
seemed to her a large proportion even for girls in 
their early teens, and she began a quiet study of 
some of them. One of the ‘very nervous’ girls who, 
her mother thought, must be taken out of school 
‘q a while, takes both piano and violin lessons, at- 
tends dancing school, goes to parties now and then, 
and rarely retires before ten o’clock. Another ‘very 
‘nervous’ girl takes piano lessons, goes to moving- 
ott shows once or twice a week, hates milk, 
’t eat eggs, doesn’t care much for fruit, and is 
ar fond of candy. In each case investigated 
there seemed to be much outside of school work 
w sich could explain the nervousness.” (2)

CHAPTER XII 
THE RELATION OF SUCCESS IN HIGH SCHOOL TO 
ENTERING AGE 
UR study of the physical and mental char- 
acteristics of the teens has suggested that 
there is a close relationship between these develop- 
Shoat success mental phases in the pupil and his 
dependsonvari- school record. Moreover, ex- 
us copditions ternal social conditions, over 
which the pupil has no control, such as nationality 
and occupation of parents on the one hand, and on 
the other the pupil’s own vocational interests and 
plans, his outside study and work, and his amuse- 
ments, which he does control, in part at least, and 
which are to some extent the reflection of physical 
and mental transformations which he is undergo- 
ing; all these also play some part in determining 
how successful he will be as a pupil. 
The influence of all these factors, physical, men- 
tal and social, depends to some extent on the age

  in years becomes, then, a significant fact to take 
into account in any inquiry we may make into his 
efficiency at a particular time. Mere age is, of 
course, only a rough measure of various underlying 
and less easily determined conditions, but, rough 
though it may be, it is of value because it yields to 
definite quantitative statement. Age is not even it- 
self a cause, it is rather an index of certain in- 
fluences which can not in themselves be so definitely 
put down in numerical terms. 
If we had accurate information of inner changes 
and the quality of work of a considerable group of 
pupils and if, also, we knew definitely the social, 
economic and recreational habits of these pupils we 
might be able to state in numerical terms the rela- 
tion of the former to the latter. The obtaining of 
such information, while difficult, is not impossible, 
and accurate statements can be made as soon as 
some one appears who has the time and the patience 
to collect the necessary data. But the data as to 
age and school success is already available and has, 
in a few. places, been carefully worked over. The 
results are interesting and suggestive. The re- 
lationships that appear are sufficiently definite to 
promise much to the student who will have the 
patience to secure measurements of the underlying 
changes which age in years only roughly indicates.

eleven-year-old and a very few over eighteen. Fig- 
ure 7 shows graphically the distribution of entering 
ages, for twenty-three successive classes, in one 
medinm-sized high school in Iowa. The sexes are 
combined in this curve since there is little differ- 
ence in the showing made by boys and girls sep- 
arately. It will be seen that, for this school, the 
most common entering age is from fourteen to 
fifteen, The median age of all entrants was about 
14.9 years. The median entering age of the one 
thousand high-school pupils in New York City 
studied by Van Denburg was found to be slightly 
less, namely 14.5. It would be of great value to 
know what degree of physiological development had 
been attained by each of these age groups at the 
time of entrance into high school. This we have no 
data for determining, but it is probable that most 
of both sexes were either maturing or matured, 
with frequent cases, however, of immature chil- 
dren especially in the age groups below fifteen.* 
The fact of greatest significance in this distribu- 
tion of entering ages is that the median age is 
Sienif less than fifteen years; that is, gnificance of i 
low median age one-half of all the pupils studied 
fer in these two cities entered before 
fifteen. This fact, we say, is significant because 
it throws some light on the ability of these ninth

elementary schools probably average six years of 
age. In New York City the average age of entrance 
is given as seven. If these Iowa children are reg- 
ularly promoted they finish the elementary course 
in eight years or at the end of their fourteenth 
year. Similarly, New York children would nor- 
mally finish the elementary schools at the end of 
their fifteenth year. If, then, more than half of 
those who enter high school enter earlier than at 
the above mentioned ages, they have at one or more 
points in their elementary-school work skipped 
grades or gained special promotions. Every such 
incident in the school-life of a child is an indica- 
tion that he has possessed, at one time or another, 
more than average ability. Those who are ready 
for high school at twelve must have made severat 
such special promotions. 
Now, if we contrast the proportion of those 
specially promoted who enter high school with the 
number of special promotions in Evidence of su- a perior ability of the entire elementary-school pop- 
high-school ulation we can get a rough meas- entrants 
ure of the ability of high-school 
entrants in comparison with the ability of school 
children generally. 
In New York City, accelerated pupils occur in 
the ratio of about one to twenty-three of the total 
elementary-school population. When, therefore, 
sixty-four per cent. of this New York group enter 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
    
   
   
    eee ry ye 
THE HIGH-SCHOOL AGE 
the ability of these children is decidedly above the 
average of elementary-school ability. At least 
sixty-four per cent. have been ranked by previous 
teachers as successful scholars and the thirty per 
cent. who entered under fourteen years were cer- 
tainly decidedly above the average according to the 
aT of the elementary schools. Thus, while 
about one in every twenty-three of elementary- 
school children gain special promotions, one in 
three of those who come to the high schools have 
apparently gained one or more of such promo- 
tions. (1) 
he number of early entrants into high school is 
not so large in Iowa City as in New York, 
Percentages of especially when we take into ac- 
early entrants count the earlier average entrance 
of these children into the primary school, but it 
is still large enough to be significant. The group 
in this latter city that entered before fifteen, the 
ca age of entrance, constituted fifty-four per 
cent. of the total, and of these, something over 
nineteen per cent. entered even before fourteen. 
These children, approximately one in five of all 
Ww entered, were thus marked by their grade 
teachers, through special promotions, as of more 
than average ability, 
Such, then, is the status of these children as 
they enter high school. The interesting question 
  
-P-A-G-E-219
THE RELATION OF SUCCESS 1o1 
Their subsequent Mow arises as to the subsequent 
records what? records made by them in their 
high-school work. Is there any relation between 
entering age and the pupil’s likelihood of finishing 
his course? Is there any relation between his en- 
tering age and his subsequent high-school scholar- 
ship? The first question can be answered definitely 
and it throws considerable light on the second ques- 
tion which can not be answered so fully. 
In general, it was found, in both Iowa and New 
York, that a larger proportion of the earlier en- 
edule entrance trants finished than of the later 
favorable to entrants. Thus, in the Iowa 
eee school studied, it was found that 
a much larger proportion of the group which en- 
tered high school between twelve and thirteen fin- 
ished in four years than in the case of any other 
older entering group; forty-six per cent. of them 
finishing on time while of those entering between 
thirteen and fourteen, forty per cent. made normal 
progress and finished in four years; thirty-two per 
cent. of the fourteen-year-olds ; twenty-two per cent. 
of the fifteen-year group; thirteen per cent. of the 
sixteen-year group, and nine per cent. of the sev- 
enteen-year group. On the other hand the percent- 
age of pupils dropping out increases rapidly as the 
age of entrance increases, starting with twenty- 
seven per cent. in the youngest group and running 
up as high as seventy-nine per cent. in the sixteen- 
year-old group.

half years’ experience in this high school are con- 
cerned, that the younger pupils adjust themselves 
more readily to the high-school régime and, being 
adjusted to it, do the work more successfully than 
do the older pupils. We can not tell just what 
relationship physiological maturity or immaturity 
bore to the varying success of the younger and 
older pupils in the classes above studied; but it is 
fortunately possible to give the actual distribution 
of degrees of maturity of a single ninth grade 
class which entered this school after the twenty- 
three classes represented by Figure 8 were studied.

infer that the large number of early entrants who 
graduated in these classes consisted mostly of early 
maturing children. It is not likely, at least, that 
the success of the younger pupils represented in 
Figure 8 was due to any great degree of immaturity, 
for the probability is that very few of them were 
physiologically immature. 
The single fact that those who graduate in this 
school form, on the whole, a younger class of chil- 
dren than the non-graduates is 
Cae. shown by Figure 9. While the 
than the non- median age of all entrants wag 
Silas found to be 14.9 years, the me« 
dian age of those who remained to graduate was 
14.6 years and of those who dropped out without 
graduating, 15.5 years. 
This same superiority of the younger over the 
older children in the expectancy of their complet- 
Similar datafrom ing the high-school course was 
New York found by Van Denburg to obtain 
among the one thousand New York City children 
whose histories he studied in detail. He found, 
for instance, that of those who entered under four- 
teen almost twice as many remained to finish as 
of those who entered at fifteen or over. 
The following table presents for easy compari- 
son the facts for these nearly equal groups in Iowa 
and in New York,

The downward trend of the percentage as the entering ages increase is the significant fact of the Tove figures for both localities. Incidentally it is also interesting to note how much ot is the proportion of western children who graduate on 
On looking over this table we may say with Van 
Denburg that, “as far as age is concerned, thirteen 
The ideal ageof 8 the ideal age for high-school

cateta and thirteen. Connecting this 
finding with our earlier discussions as to the physi- 
ological and mental changes of the earlier half of 
the teens, we may conclude that these changes are, 
on the whole, unsettling and that the child who 
can make the transition from the grammar school 
to the high school early is more likely to get ad- 
justed to the conditions he finds there and finish 
the course than one who enters in the very midst 
of the mental changes that are likely to occur at 
fourteen and fifteen. Moreover, inasmuch as the 
period of rapid physical development begins for 
most children before fourteen, these figures seem 
to confirm the assertion made in Chapter III, that 
the physical changes that occur early do not in

themselves usually lessen the child’s school ability, 
while the mental readjustments which follow the 
physical changes have a decided tendency to un- 
settle the pupil. 
Whatever the immediate causes may be of the 
dropping out of the older entrants, we should not 
Periodof mental at least lose sight of the fact that 
readjustment ap- these pupils are, at the very be- parently unfa- ge ; 
vorable for ginning of their course, undergo- 
ponte ing more or less profound 
changes, intellectual and emotional, and that these 
changes in inner attitude can not fail to influence 
them in definite ways toward their studies, toward 
immediate social matters and toward the multitude 
of general social and economic influences in their 
local environments. The boy who enters on his 
high-school course when he is in the throes of the 
“new birth” into the social world, or when he is 
gripped by the intense longing for “larger things,” 
when he begins to feel the impatient vague idealism 
jot the middle teens, or when he is absorbingly i in- 
‘terested in his girl associates, and is, above all, 
eager for adventure and to play a “man’s part” in 
the world, such a boy will yield himself unwillingly 
to the narrow round of school tasks with their ex- 
acting requirements. He will inevitably find him- 
self “looking over the edge of his school work,” 
wishing for his real life to begin. He will, if he 
is an average boy, grasp at almost any pretext to 
quit school.  
-P-A-G-E-226
  We do not believe, however, that there could not 
be a TT which would hold the majority of boys 
and girls in their middle teens. 
We only know that, at present,

since the twelve and thirteen year olds “stick” bet- 
ter, that the subjects and methods of teaching are 
better adapted to their needs than to the needs of 
their older classmates. 
It is possible also that the greater success shown 
by these younger pupils is due to their greater na- 
tive ability, which they show themselves to possess 
by the very fact of their earlier entrance. If this 
fact lies nearer to the real cause of their greater 
success, we should have to say that it indicates 
that the work of the high schools is pitched on 
too high a plane for the boys and girls of average 
ability to succeed with it. In any case there is 
lack of adjustment either to the average age or 
to the average ability of the high-school pupil as 
we find him in our schools at present. 
Another graph, Figure 10, may be presented, 
not, however, bearing on the question of age and 
Piiiielapent to, success in school, but answering 
complete high- the question as to how long a 
poke course time those who actually graduate 
take to complete the high-school course. It. will 
be seen that the range of time is from two and 
one-half to seven years; the most common time 
being, of course, four years. The amount of vari- 
ation from this time is, however, significant. There 
are no corresponding figures in the New York 
study. 
Thus far, in this chapter, we have confined our 
attention to the influence of age of entrance into
-P-A-G-E-228
  Quality of work of high school on later success, this 
the graduatesand being measured solely in terms of 
ape graduation in four years. The 
quality of work done by these pupils has not other- 
wise been considered. The question now arises— 
do these pupils who stay in and finish do any higher 
grade of work than those who drop out? Is the 
ied out related to a lower grade of work, 
or do the eliminated pupils while in school do as 
well as those who remain to finish? We should 
hard ly suppose, to start with, that the eliminated 
pupil s would be high-grade pupils. If their work 
is in erior, however, we should not conclude that 
lack of ability to do the work is the sole cause of 
their stopping school. This poor work might be 
due in part to their greater interest in things out- 
side of school. These two factors we are not here 
able to separate. They are probably always opera- 
tive together, the one augmenting the other. A 
greater absorption in things outside of school will 
make even a bright boy neglect studies. Inferior 
success in his studies will still further reduce his 
interest in them. On the other hand, the duller 
boy who finds he does not get on well in school 
will turn his attention to things outside. All in- 
quiries into the quality of work of graduates and 
non-graduates unite in the finding that the latter 
group is, as a whole, inferior to the former; but 
they do not show how far this inferiority is due 
to hes of ability and how far to “other interests.”         
 
-P-A-G-E-229
THE RELATION OF SUCCESS 201 
It is true that there is a suggestion that the poor 
work of the non-graduates is due, in a measure, 
to lack of ability, in the fact that the graduates 
usually possess a higher ability to start with as 
indicated by their earlier entrance; but, even so, : 
the ability is of that somewhat narrow range which 
is tested by school standards. We know that much 
general capacity may fail to be detected through 
the record of the pupil at school tasks.

In the following eter we present the re- 
sults of typical studies on the relation of quality of 
work to elimination. i ) 
The study of the records ‘of the one thousand 
forty-two pupils of the Iowa City High School, 
Tiustration previously referred to, showed 
Espen Hows that the non-graduates were in- 
ferior it scholarship to the graduates. The facts 
are p ented in Figure 11, and require little further 
comment. Only one-third of the highest grades, 
ninety-five to one hundred, belonged to the non- 
grac wal es. Two-fifths, only, of the grades, from 
eighty-five to ninety-five, belonged to those who 
dropped out. Nearly an equal number of grades, 
from seventy to eighty-five, were made by both 
groups, while the grades below seventy, the passing 
mark, were recorded for non-graduates more than 
four times as frequently as for the graduates. 
While these figures show that the non-graduates 
did, on the whole, work inferior to the graduates, 
bai show also that a large number of the non-grad- 
ei did average and some even superior work. 
Van Denburg had his group of one thousand 
‘New York pupils rated by their teachers as to 
Illustration from ability, industry and results, This 
New York rating was done soon after they 
“entered on their first i work in their 
Tr high schools.(1) |

in high school as follows: 
   High Average Low Ability 3 years 1% years Yyear Industry . 3% years 1% years 1 year Results 3 years 1% years 1 year 
It was also found that the average standing, or 
mark, made by these pupils in their first term’s 
work, bore an important relation to the likelihood 
of their continuing in school. For instance, one- 
half of all who made an average grade of less than 
fifty per cent. left before the beginning of their 
second half-year, 
The median expectancy of the various grades of 
pupils, according to their first term’s average mark, 
is summarized in the following figures: 
1st Term’s Marks

50-59% 1 year 
60-69% 1% years 
70-79% 2% years

This study does not give any data as to the later 
marks made by these pupils; but it is significant that 
the first records made by them, and their first im- 
pressions on their teachers, forecast so definitely 
heir later school history. If these standings rep- 
esent with approximate fairness the later grades, 
e can say that here, also, there is a distinct tend-
-P-A-G-E-232
ency for the el or pupils to be of inferior 
ort i) 
A ‘study by Johnson of the grades in Eng- 
lish, Latin, mathematics and history made by 
‘dibhcetromn pupils of high schools in Chicago 
Chie go and and Kansas City, revealed the 
a ory same tendency, namely, lower 
grades on the whole for the eliminated pupils, the 
percentage of elimination increasing steadily as the 
ades became lower. ‘This tendency was less 
marked in the case of four small schools investi- 
gated by Johnson, the pupils who left being more 
evenly distributed among all des of proficiency. 
It is possible, as Johnson says, that this is because 
the small high school provides opportunity for more 
individual attention to poorer pupils so that they 
The likely to become discouraged and quit.(2) 
We are, ourselves, inclined to doubt that the 
better showing of small schools in keeping their 
Telble anall pupils is due to any superiority of 
school really these schools in the matter of 
| Bane ee handling their pupils. It is rather 
‘because the conditions generally in small com- 
pnb are more favorable than in larger ones to 
tinuing in school. More inferior pupils remain 
tl graduate because it is apt to be the understanding 
jn a small town that practically every one who re- 
aains steadfast to the end f the course will receive 
a diploma. It is very hard, in such communities,

of the parents, actually to fail any pupils who are 
just below the border line of passing. Only very 
extreme cases are likely to suffer loss of the diploma. 
It thus happens that larger percentages of inferior 
pupils in small schools will be passed on the basis of 
very inferior work than is apt to be the case in 
larger schools.

Obvious as this may be when one stops to reflect a 
moment, it is often lost sight of by intelligent 
people. An efficient high school is apt to be con- 
ceived in terms of the excellence of its buildings, 
laboratories, libraries and even of its scholarly 
teachers. These factors are of importance, but 
their importance is not intrinsic. An efficient high 
school is rather the one which is successful in hold- 
ing its pupils; in fostering therewith proper life 
ideals and in developing suitable habits of living. 
In a word, its worth is to be measured entirely by 
the degree in which it can actually bring to the 
pupils as a whole a training which will continue to 
function in a vital way in their lives after they leave 
the high school. 
Such a training as this is the result, in part, of 
the studies which the children take; in part, of 
the material equipment accessory to these studies. 
But it is even more dependent on certain intimate 
adaptations to the physical, mental and social char- 
acteristics of the pupil during the time he is in 
high school.  
-P-A-G-E-236
       La 4 
Among these adaptations there are, first of all, 
those which aim to secure the least wasteful adjust- 
Adaptations ment between the school and the 
needed entering pupil. The heaviest 
elimination occurs in the first year and in the first 
part of that year. Physiological age, or degree of 
physical maturity, has, as we have seen, an impor- 
tant bearing on this adjustment. Mature pupils 
in high school do better work than the immature. 
This is especially true of the earlier maturing chil- 
dren, as is seen by the fact that those who enter be- 
fore fourteen are more likely to graduate than 
those who enter later. | 
The changing mental attitudes of the teens are 
also vitally related to success, both at the beginning “ote 
radial att and throughout the high-school 
tudes of the pu- period. As we have seen, the at- 
pils must be titudes of the mature boy or girl considered 1 
toward authority and discipline 
are essentially different from those of little boys 
and girls. Their intellectual interests are in proc- 
ess of change; their moral sense is developing; 
their social nature is expanding. All of these are 
factors which complicate the work of the high 
school. They make it the more difficult for the 
pupil to adjust himself to the work which lies be- 
fore him. li 
Let us assume, here, that the work itselfi—that 
is, the studies—are what they should be, and we’ 
do not imply that they are not. Let us simply con-

fine our attention to the means which have been 
used to help the pupil fit himself with the greatest 
economy to this work.

School Period in Retrospect,” pupils experience

pam anted often find themselves submerged 
in a large and unfamiliar group of children at an 
age when many are peculiarly sensitive to the matter 
of associates. Their teachers are strange and they 
often find it hard to know them personally as they 
knew their elementary teachers. They are thrown 
more on their own responsibility both as to time and 
method in the getting of their lessons. The studies 
themselves present new difficulties. They are quite 
different from those which have occupied the pupils 
in their previous school work. The books are often 
hard to read or hard to comprehend. The aims of 
the work seem different, the standards different, 
the teachers different, and the pupils themselves are 
different, although they do not know it. Obviously, 
there must be careful guiding or many of the pupils 
will get little good out of the work, if they do not, 
in their discouragement, even drop it altogether. 
It appears from the chapter cited in the preceding 
paragraph, that there is the greatest need for the

one thing | hich high-school pupils think more about 
than their relation to their teachers. They are 
keenly sensitive of their teachers’ attitudes toward 
them, and, as we have seen, the work of these 
pupils is definitely influenced for better or worse 
by the way they regard their teachers and by the 
way they imagine their teachers regard them. At 
no stage in a child’s school life is his relation to his 
teachers so important as in the teens. Conse- 
quently, all those means which can be used to cul- 
tivate friendly relations, respect and confidence be- 
tween pupils and teachers will do much toward 
carrying the pupil through the critical first year of 
his high-school life. 
Many high schools have adopted various types of 
advisory systems to meet these needs. We are 
frank to say that we believe some 
scheme of this kind, systematic- 
ally carried out, is of the utmost importance for 
every truly successful high school. As some one 
has said, an advisory system is a means of restoring 
the personal element in the relation of the school 
to the pupil. Strange that we should ever have let 
ourselves lose anything so vital as this in adolescent 
education! 1] 
A recent investigation of advisory systems in 
high schools in the United States(1) brought to 
light much interesting effort on the part of many 
schools, and also revealed the fact that a large num- Advisory systems

ber of schools are doing nothing of a definite char- 
acter along this line. 
It would seem that the high school would be 
greatly helped in its effort to help the pupil get ad- 
justed to the new conditions if it | 
eee of should secure from the grammar : 
formation regard- school a rather complete report of | ing pupils re 
the pupil’s record there; not 
tnerely his record as a pupil but a statement of such 
personal traits as would be of value to the high- 
school principal and teachers in their first contact 
with him. A majority of the schools reporting re- 
ceive no such preliminary information, and, of those 
receiving it, scarcely more than one-half receive 
more than the bare scholastic record of the pupils’ 
work in the lower school. About two-thirds only 
attempt, after the entrance of the pupil, “to get from 
him or his parent any personal history which would 
assist the high school in giving wise educational, 
vocational or personal advice.” 
As this investigator well says: “If the ante- 
cedents of blooded live stock are of such importance 
as to justify all the pains taken to know the pedigree 
of the animals, it would seem that the high school, 
with the help of the grammar school, should do 
more than these returns indicate to know what kind 
of animals or human beings it is taking under train- 
ing.” (Condensed. ) 
It is not strange, with this large neglect to se-

cure information about the pip, that only ne 
sixty per cent. of all schools reported any acti 
advisory relations between each pupil and some par- 
ticular teacher. Ht | 
The function of the adviser is, as was said above, 
to preserve, or perhaps even to restore, the per- 
Thefahetiqnes Sonal element in the school. The 
thehigh-school degree in which this end is at- 
acre tained varies greatly in different 
schools maintaining advisers, “The advisership 
runs all the way from purely routine oversight, rec- 
ord keeping and ordinary discipline . . . . to the most 
intimate and exacting personal, friendly relations 
with responsibility placed upon the adviser for all 
phases of the pupil’s relations to the school. . . . a 
The varying quality of the advisory work can also 
be judged by the number of pupils assigned to a 
teacher. Where this number is given as twenty- 
five or thirty, one would expect rather effective 
oversight for, as one principal writes, “Out of thirty 
assigned to a teacher, not more than five or six take 
any great amount of time.”(1)) But where the 
number of pupils in charge of one person runs up 
into the hundreds, we can easily see that the ad- 
visory work will be quite casttal and superficial.

relation of parent and child is ideal, advice which | 
the parent is only partly qualified to give is often | 
needed regarding school relationships. After all, 
it is not so much the advice that is of importance 
as the personal relationship and interest lying back 
of it. This is what the high-school pupil needs both 
at home and in school, and any amount of wise 
personal influence at home will not compensate for 
the lack of it at school. In the high-school pupils’ 
reminiscences, quoted in a preceding chapter, it is 
shown clearly how pupils miss the spirit of friendly 
interest and advice if it is not present. There can 
be no question but that better work is done for 
those teachers and in those schools where kindly 
and helpful relations between teachers and pupils 
have been fostered. No one element stands out 
more distinctly than this in the accounts which 
young folks give of their life in high school.

parent adviser where such a one exists. His aim

will need more or less help in learning how to study 
high-school lessons with economy and effectiveness.

As he proceeds with his work he may have to be 
reproved or disciplined, or — may, through in- 
ability or neglect, be nable to o handle his school 
tasks. In every such instance the adviser should 
be the first person to talk the difficulty over with 
the pupil, and in many cases the evidence of per- 
sonal interest and concern shown by some one 
teacher is all that is needed to restore him toa 
more wholesome frame of mind or to a more thor- 
ough determination to do better work. 
lf the adviser keeps the | fee group of pupils 
throughout their course, he will have opportunity 
to study them carefully and, as the semesters pass, 
he will find himself able to enter more and more 
definitely into their lives and give them wise coun- 
sel. As his charges reach the later teens he will 
find his function as an adviser expanding accord- 
ingly. All sorts of intellectual, personal, vocational, 
social, moral and even religious problems will be 
presented by his pupils, an ‘if he is a teacher of 
any sincerity and of any depth of character he will 
be able to do much for them of inestimable value. 
In the investigation referred to above, one principal 
reports that his teachers are expected in three or 
four weeks to know all about the small group of 
twenty or thirty pupils assigned to them. “They 
visit homes or send for parents. My teachers think 
that this takes twenty to twenty-five per cent. of 
their effort. It pays.” fi 
The successful administration of an advisory

system involves careful attention to a number of | 
Some problems problems. First of all there is | 
of administration the question of whether the prin- 
cipal shall be able to be the sole adviser or whether 
the teachers shall assist or assume the duty; in this 
case, what should be the relation of the principal 
to the advisory function? Then again, how large 
groups shall be assigned to each teacher, and how 
shall the teacher proceed to give his services? Shall 
it be made to appeal to the pupil as quite informal 
or unofficial; it not being announced to them that 
they have been assigned to the charge of particular 
teachers, or shall the opposite plan prevail? Shall 
the advisers be especially qualified teachers, relieved 
of a little class work, or had they best be persons 
regularly employed for this purpose, and doing little 
or no teaching? The answers to these questions 
depend on so many local conditions that general 
answers would here be unprofitable. They are 
offered simply as things a principal must think about 
in developing any system of advisers. 
Perhaps an even more important problem than 
any of the above is that of the personality of the 
The personality teachers who are to perform this 
of the adviser service. It is not likely that any 
school has a faculty in which all are equally well 
qualified for this work, and yet its success depends 
very largely on the types of teachers who are asked 
to undertake it. When a principal has decided to 
inaugurate such a system he must carefully con-

teens are they for whom the schools have been built 
and equipped. 
The teacher of adolescents must be thoroughly 
interested in boys and girls; he must be in love with 
life, as they are. If he has found life hard, he must 
not permit that to embitter him. What Miss Slat- 
tery says of the woman teacher is true of the man 
as well: “The fact that she has met hardships 
and conquered them, has met sorrow and it has 
only deepened her sympathy and broadened her 
outlook on life, makes her a real inspiration to the 
girls who meet her..... "{2) 
The following sentences out of a personal letter 
from Mr. Raymer throw interesting light on the 
Thefutureofad- problem of advisers. He writes: 
visory systems “T am unable to see a very high 
degree of efficiency in advisory systems until the 
powers in control are willing to pay the price for 
the right kind of teachers with time to do the work.” 
And further: “The success of any advisory sys- 
tem depends so much on the attitude of the principal 
of the school that I am inclined to look for results 
to a new generation of high-school principals who 
shall have been trained for their work in modern 
schools of education, and who shall have a some- 
what different idea of the social bearings of high- 
school education than the ideas generally held by 
those in charge to-day...... The right kind 
of teachers can do very much effective advisory 
work without the adoption of any definite system

     or even pronounced policy by principal. When 
such teachers beco principals, advisory efforts 
may become systematized without being made me- 
chanical, and may become nl without being 
officious or offensive.” 
Three other important types of effort to adjust 
the school to the pupil may z briefly mentioned; 
Other ad- efforts whidhido not of necessity 
canliens depend on an advisory. system. 
They are these: development of study programs; 
supervised study; and eit. hours. 
These, as will be seen at once, are all attempts to 
enable the student to handle his studies more effect- 
ively. Here is really the central difficulty with 
much of the work of the school. Failure to be in- 
terested in the work or to do it to the satisfaction 
of the teachers is the opening breach in the wall of 
many a high-school student’s good intentions. If 
his school work does not really engage his attention 
4 grip his interest, “other things” will, and a 
survey of our high schools is pet to give one the 
impression that it is the “other things” rather than 
what the pupils are sappocelah | in school for that 
are tending largely to absorb their energies. 
Many discriminating teachers and principals are 
coming to believe that failure in work is quite as 
much due to lack of systematic, intelligent effort 
spent in study as to lack of bility to do the work. 
ne principal reports go d results through the 
development of study programs. He had study pro-

gram cards printed with direc- 
tions for study, and each pupil 
was required to fill it out and follow it carefully. 
The results were noticeable. The conduct of the 
pupils improved, considerable gains were made in 
scholarship, more systematic habits of home study 
were built up.(3) 
But students in high school need also to be taught 
how to study. It has been found that many pupils’ 
Teaching pupils failure to get their lessons is due 
how to study to inattention to their assign- 
ments or perhaps to failure to comprehend them. 
More and more, high schools are realizing the need 
of pupils doing more of their studying at school 
under the personal supervision of the various 
teachers. This necessitates a longer school-day; 
but that should not be injurious to children in their 
teens, especially if the getting of lessons at school 
leaves them freer for recreation outside of school. 
For detailed accounts of what some schools are do- 
ing toward the development of supervised study in 
school, the reader is referred to articles mentioned 
at the close of this chapter.(4, 5) 
The Pittsburgh high schools report a development 
called the “Conference Hour.” By a slight readjust-

points and in discussing i bidicting proper 
modes of study. The results are reported as very 
gratifying. (6) | i | 
One other possible adaptation may be briefly men- 
tioned. It is that of grouping boys and girls in 
The problem of their middle teens in separate 
coeducation | __classes' or sections. Coeducation 
in one form or another seems to be the settled 
policy of secondary education in most sections of 
our country. The old argume ts against coeduca- 
tion, namely, that the girls were not capable of 
doing the work, that they were not physically strong 
enough and that such intimate contact of the sexes 
would promote early marriages or endanger the 
morals of boys and girls, have not been supported 
by experience. | { 
However, new objections against coeducation 
have arisen. The girls, instead of being less capa- 
ble than the boys, have usually proved themselves 
able to do better work. This is in part due to the 
fact that girls in high school are further developed 
both physically and mentally chan boys of the same 
age. Most teachers of mixed classes find the girls 
more ready to do assigned work and more ready 
to recite in class. The qualities in school work 
which exert considerable influence on grades, girls, 
on the whole, excel in. These qualities are neat- 
ness, accuracy, excellence of ‘memory, faithfulness 
in preparation of lessons and readiness to recite. 
Boys frequently accuse girls of simply studying

for the grades, They find themselves easily out- 
distanced by the girls, the work itself, especially 
in language, literature and history, is almost in- 
evitably presented from the point of view most 
interesting to the girl, the method of the recitation 
itself is adapted to the more responsive girl. Surely 
no system could be better devised to render boys 
disgruntled with their work or to furnish them 
with an additional incentive to quit it altogether. 
The first of the later arguments against coed- 
ucation is, then, that the difference in maturity 
4 of the sexes, age for age, in the 
Eeseanence Of middle teens is a distinct draw- 
turity of boys back to their being taught to- and girls ' 
gether in the same classes. A 
second argument against it also has some weight. 
Coeducation renders difficult the suitable differenti- 
ation of studies according to the physical, intel- 
lectual and vocational needs of each sex. A third 
argument is, that coeducation prevents the develop- 
ment of the finer feminine qualities in the girl 
and the more virile qualities in the boy. And 
fourthly, that, though the girl may endure the strain 
of work of the ordinary coeducational school, her 
health may actually be impaired. 
We shall not attempt here to argue for or against 
these last three points. The first point, based on 
the girl’s greater maturity, is sufficient to warrant 
@ reconstruction of our whole system of education 
for the middle teens,

(A posaibieial able or practicable, it remains to 
justment in be seen whether some adjustment 
“segregation” can be made to the situation un-

lieve that the problem can be solved in a large 
degree by means of boys’ and girls’ sections of 
the same class. According to this plan, the boys

in study rooms and halls but recite in different 
sections, '

School (Chicago), after several years’ trial of this 
Differences in scheme believes it a most desir- 
work of boys able adaptation. He contends 
aude that there are marked differences 
in the reaction of the boys and girls in class work. 
Girls excel in verbal memory, in all sorts of lan- 
guage study, in written work done outside of class; 
boys are keener observers, especially in the sciences, 
more logical reasoners, and love to try experiments. 
“In history, girls do more reference reading and 
get a better hold on the history of art and cus- 
toms. Boys profit more by a study of the causes 
that underlie great historic movements. In mathe- 
matics, boys do more original work. It requires 
more energy on the part of the teacher to secure 
home work (on the part of the boys).(7, 8) As 
a result of several years of experience, in this high

school, in teaching boys and girls in separate classes 
during the first two years of their course, it has 
been found that many more boys stay in school 
than formerly, their scholarship has so distinctly 
improved as to be equal if not superior to that 
of the girls, and both sexes seem on the whole to 
be happier in their work. (8) 
It is manifest that this plan of “limited segre- 
gation” can be worked out only in a large school 
Possible in where it is necessary, in any case, 
large schools to section the classes. In smaller 
schools the difference in the reaction of the sexes 
must be met by more skilful and sympathetic teach- 
ing. In every such school the supervising officers 
must be on the alert to see that the methods of 
instruction do not develop altogether in favor of 
the girl. The point of view of the just maturing 
boy must be studied and he must be allowed to 
work in such a way as not continually to sug- 
gest that he is not as capable as the girl. Much 
of this could be accomplished through the plans of 
supervised study, referred to above, which many 
schools are now trying out. 
With these brief suggestions as to needful 
adaptations on the part of the high school to the 
human nature of boys and girls, the chapter, and 
with it the volume, may be brought to a close. 
Not every possible “moral” has been pointed out, 
nor need it be. The social needs and their suit- 
able satisfaction have not been taken up but they

well as by the present writer.(9, 10) 
It is the hope of the writes that these eilé 
chapters, on this most interesting period of life, 
may lead some readers to a new and profitable inter- 
est in the study of the eae nature of the high 
school pupil. 224 THE iui AGE |

The Childhood and Youth Series 
HE Childhood and Youth Series is the first sys« 
tematic attempt to give to parents, teachers, 
social workers and all others interested in the care 
and training of the young, the best modern knowl-, 
edge about children in a manner easily understood 
and thoroughly interesting. The various volumes 
present in popular style the results of research in 
every phase of child-life, every topic being handled 
with strict scientific accuracy, but at the same time 
in a simple, concrete and practical way. 
Special emphasis is laid on the everyday problems arising in 
the activities of the home and school, the street and places of 
work and amusement. Each subject is discussed by a prominent 
authority, competent to deal with it alike in its scientific and 
practical aspects. It has been constantly borne in mind by the 
author of each volume that the Childhood and Youth Series is 
intended primarily as a guide for parents and teachers. 
Much of the literature that we have had in the past dealing 
with such subjects has had no popular appeal or application, It 
has been dry, technical and unintelligible for the average mother 
—uninteresting to her, at least. The Childhood and Youth Series. 
however, is not academic in any respect; it is intimate and con- 
fidential, the authors taking the attitude of friends and advisers 
and their style having all the characteristics of convincing heart- 
to-heart talks. If they are always scientific, they are also always 
sympathetic. 
In the general field of the child’s welfare and 
progress in mind, Lody and emotions, the practi- 
cal results of the latest scientific study are set forth 
in clear and graphic form. 
Questions of many and widely varying kinds are considered 
questions which come up every day in the home and in the 
school and which parents and teachers find it difficult to answer. 
fhe problems of food, nutrition, hygiene, physical defects aad

The Childhood and Youth Series \) 
deficiencies, nerves and nervous energy, sleep, stimulants and nar- 
cotics, etc., receive careful treatment. The intellectual phases 
are considered in other volumes, devoted to perception, mem~- 
ory, reason and the imagination. Such emotions as fear, anger, 
pride, shame and the like are adequately treated. 
In matters that have to do with the child’s moral and social 
well-being, all the latest theories are tested and explained. The 
causes and prevention of juvenile delinquency receive fullest 
consideration. 
All the aspects of a rational education based on 
the nature and needs of childhood claim atten- 
tion here. 
The various types of schools, the various methods of teaching 
particular subjects, the relation between work and play, learning 
and doing, the school and the community, are discussed for the 
benefit of parents and teachers, 
Another group of volumes deals with special traits of child- 
hood and youth,—their reading and dramatie interests, clothes 
and personal appearance, the use of money, etc. 
The entire series is under the general editor- 
ship of M. V. O’Shea, Professor of Education, 
the University of Wisconsin. 
Every book in the Childhood and Youth Series 
is of value to the parent who wishes the best for 
his child and to the teacher who is seeking higher 
efficiency.

  AN your child spell? Spelling takes more at: 
tention in the home than almost any other 
subject taught in the schools. The drills and prac- 
tice exercises, the daily preparation for subsequent 
work in the class-room call for the parent’s co- 
operation. 
No subject taught in the schools requires more individual at- 
tention than Spelling, on the part of the teacher, who is continu: 
ally confronted with new problems as to how best the subject may 
be presented to meet individual differences on the part of pupils 
William A. Cook, Assistant Professor of Education in 
the University of Colorado, and M. V. O’Shea, Professor of 
Education in the University of Wisconsin, have conducted 
a series of investigations extending over a considerable 
period, with a view to contributing to the solution of the 
various problems connected with the teaching of spelling. 
First, an examination of the spelling history and abilities ot 2 
Jarge number of pupils in a rather general way was carried on. 
Second, a study was made of a small group in a very thorough- 
going manner. Third, followed an examination of about 300,000 
words in common usage, both in speech and correspondence, in 
order to determine which words should receive attention in the 
spelling vocabulary. 
The Child and His Spelling By WILLIAM A. COOK and M. V. O'SHEA 
contains the results of these experiments, and presents a thor 
oughgoing, practicable explanation of (1) the psychology of spell 
ing; (2) effective methods of teaching spelling; (3) spelling need: 
of typical Americans; (4) words pupils should learn. 
The material contained in The Child and His Spelling 
will be found of the greatest yalue to teachers and to par- 
ents who desire to co-operate at home with the work of 
the school in the education of children. This work con- 
stitutes one volume of the CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH 
SERIES.

HUND ED thousand American mothers 
venerate the name of Mrs. Frederic Schoff 
ae Kent Schoff). She has dedicated her 
ife to the work of making the new generation 
better, stronger and more efficient, and has been 
an inspiration to every woman in the land to do 
her full part to insure the future of America. 
Through her leadership of the National Congress of Mothers 
and Parent-Teacher Associations, she is the presiding genius of 
he greatest educational movement this country has known. 
As President of the Philadelphia Juvenile Court and Pro- 
bation Association, she has had an opportunity to study 
the wayward children of a great city. She has carried on 
extensive investigations among men and women confined 
in prisons and correctional institutions to learn from them 
at first hand to what they attribute their downfall. 
By this broad experience she is qualified to speak with 
unique authority on the training of children in the home, 
and aide on the problem of the wayward child. 
She makes a forceful appeal to parents both because of their 
natural desire to guard their children from all harmful influ- 
ences and because they realize that home training, which comes 
first of all in every child’s life, moulds his morality. If any 
parent doubts this, he needs more than ever to study 
The Wayward Child By HANNAH KENT SCHOFF 
President National Congress of Mothersand Parent-Teacher Associations; 
President Philadelphia Juvenile Court and Probation Association 
She shows beyond all doubt that the early training in the home 
can make or unmake characters at will, that homes in which 
children have been brought up carelessly or inefficiently are 
largely responsible for the wayward children who later make 
up our criminal population. | 
THE WAYWARD CHILD is one of the books in the 
CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH SERIES, undoubtedly the 
most important collections of practical educational works 
for parents and teachers ever produced in this country. 
As a guide for the home or school it is unexcelled.

F YOUR CHILD grows up to be a spendthrift 
blame yourself. It is the fault of the training 
received in childhood, or the lack of it. 
But parents are hard pressed for ways and means 
of teaching their children how to use money— 
how to save it, and how to spend it. 
Should a child have a regular allowance? Should he be given 
money when he asks for it or only when he really needs it? 
Should he be given money as a reward or as a payment for 
services? Should he be allowed to work for money at an early 
age? 
Professor E. A. Kirkpatrick has made a special study of 
children to learn their attitude toward money in the 
home and the world outside. He has carried on investi- 
gations to determine their natural inclinations and decide 
how parents may encourage the right inclinations and 
curb those which lead to the unhappy extremes in the 
use of money—miserliness or prodigality. 
The Use cf Money By E. A. KIRKPATRICK 
State Normal School, Fitchburg, Mass.; author of Fundamentals of 
Child Study, The Individual in the Making, etc, 
It offers sound advice, which any parent will be fortunate to 
obtain. It tells when the child should begin to learn the real 
value of money and how to dispose of it properly, and suggests 
methods by which this training may be given. It clears the 
mind of all doubt as to how to induce thrift in the child, so that 
in later life he will be better equipped, not only for business, 
but in the conduct of the household and private affairs. 
THE USE OF MONEY, like all the other books in the 
famous Childhood and Youth Series, is designed to be of 
immediate, practical benefit to the average parent, guard- 
ian or teacher.

  i. is a child backward? May he be backward in some ways and forward in 
others? Are children backward by birth, or made 
so by neglect or faults of training? What are the 
signs of backwardness? Is there any way of de- 
termining whether a child is permanently back- 
ward? When and how may backwardness be 
cured? i 
These questions and others like them are of supreme impor- 
tance to-day to teachers and parents. People are seeking light 
from every source upon the problems of the backward child. 
Dr. Holmes, Dean of the Pennsylvania State College, has 
studied backward children in the clinic and laboratory as 
well as in the home and school, and he is recognized as a 
first authority in America on arrested development. 
Out of a fund of scientific knowledge he has written his book 
in simple, sympathetic and popular style to help those who are 
striving to help slow boys and girls and reclaim the mentally 
arrested. He tells the parent and the teacher what they need to 
know in language they can understand. 
Backward Children _ By ARTHUR HOLMES 
Author of The Conservation of the Child, etc. 
Dean Holmes treats concrete cases of backwardness in detail 
and pictures vividly the various types. Everything he says is 
definite, practical, helpful. 
THE CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH SERIES, in which 
BACKWARD CHILDREN is issued, is a collection of books 
by recognized authorities on the development and train- 
ing of children, under the general editorship of M. V. 
O’Shea, of the University of Wisconsin.

ONESTY is not an inborn trait. It is not the 
essential inheritance of children of “good 
families.” It is the delicate product of careful 
training. A proper regard for mine and thine is 
effected by a thousand subtle influences of hered- 
ity and environment, home and school and com- 
munity conditions, physical and mental health. 
Experts have subjected the whole question to minute scrutiny 
and proved that the cultivation of honesty is a matter of personal 
application to the individual child. They have laid the founda- 
tion for an entire new “Science of Conduct.” 
Dr. Healy, Director of the Juvenile Psychopathic Insti- 
tute and adviser to the Juvenile Court in Chicago, is one 
of these experts. He gives the parent, teacher and social 
worker the benefit of broad, sane, sound observation. 
The quickest way to a cure for stealing, Dr. Healy believes, is 
to find the way to the inner mental life of the delinquent, and 
he reveals how this may be accomplished in 
Honesty 
By WILLIAM HEALY 
His aim is to prevent and to cure stealing by children. By the 
faithful description of many actual cases of theft, their underly- 
ing causes and successful or bungling treatment, he shows what 
to guard against and what to foster; how to make a proper diag- 
nosis and effect the cure. He writes with tolerance, sympathy, 
kindliness, for he loves children. 
THE CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH SERIES, in which 
HONESTY is issued, includes works on the special traits 
of childhood, as well as books dealing with various phases 
in the physical, mental, moral and social development of 
the child.

  TT HE cfitees world is awakening to the rights 
of the child, and to the fact that its right of 
rights is the right to be well-born. Heredity is 
recognized as a factor of supreme importance in 
determining the child’s nature; yet there is no 
subject on which there is such general ignorance 
and so much superstition. 
What is “prenatal influence,” and what are its limitations? 
What traits and habits may be transmitted? How far does the 
parent’s body and brain and character affect the child’s heritage 
at birth, and how far the more remote ancestor’s? Do degen- 
erate parents beget degenerate children? To what extent are 
physical and mental defects due to ipberitance and not to en- 
vironment or training? 
On these and similar questions there is the widest 
difference of opinion and belief, and ie grossest error, 
among intelligent people who are not familiar with the 
latest results of scientific study. | 
Professor Guyer, of the University of Iaiscotsin, who has 
studied the We problem of heredity in a thoroughgoing way, 
has prepared a book to take away the mystery and misunder- 
standing, and to enlighten parents, teachers and social workers 
on an all-important subject. He calls it 
Being Well-Born By MICHAEL F, GUYER 
Professor of Zoology in the University of Wisconsin, 
Author of Animal Micrology, etc. 
His work includes an account of the new science of Eugenics 
which is striving for the betterment of the race, the conservation 
of good stock and the repression of bad. 
This concrete, practical book on Heredity and Eugenics 
naturally falls in THE CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH 
SERIES, which undertakes to treat child-nature from 
every viewpoint, and which is the most complete, scien- 
tific and satisfactory collection of books on child-problems 
now published. 7

HE most informed child who is ever turned out 
of the modern educational system will be of 
little use to himself or the world if he has not strongly 
developed the instinct to do things for himself. 
Like every other fundamental quality this can be acquired 
only by daily exercise occurring naturally in the routine of life. 
And yet to find in the home and school life of the child 
sufficient opportunity for this daily exercise is becoming 
increasingly difficult. 
Self-Reliance gives plain, direct suggestions which can 
be put into practice now, at once, to-day, in any 
American home or school. 
The old opportunities for training children in self-help and 
initiative have in many cases disappeared. Mrs. Fisher shows 
how the parent and teacher may utilize for training in self 
reliance a great many of the new elements in modern life. 
Self-Reliance By DOROTHY CANFIELD FISHER 
Author of A Montessori Mother, Mothers and Children, etc. 
The book is a friendly magnifying glass through which each 
reader may inspect his own family life and detect in it many 
more chances than he had supposed to let the children have 
their share of responsibility. 
The books in THE CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH SERIES 
are written for the American home of average means 
and the American school of progressive purposes.

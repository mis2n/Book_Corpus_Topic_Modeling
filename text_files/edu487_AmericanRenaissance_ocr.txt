THE AMERICAN RENAISSANCE 
Course in appreciation of the American Renaissance 
Suggestions to the Teachers 
The great influence that the art of the Colonial Period, known 
as the American Renaissance,-has exerted upon the architecture and 
home furnishings of the present day and its historical significance 
as the true expression of the ideals, character and customs of the 
Colonial people are sufficient reasons for introducing this subject 
more generally in the curriculum of the public schools of America 
at the present time. It is the prevailing custom in teaching Colonial 
history to deal with the political and historical events, totally 
neglecting any consideration of the remarkable artistic achieve 
ments in the greatest development of creative art that this country 
has ever capetieneed” "WR ikea les oy af Pail Hevoree ride, yet 
they are ignorant of the fact that he was the greatest silversmith 
of his time. They know nothing of Stuart and Copley or the 
other portrait artists, whose works are the only likenesses of the 
great statesman that we have. Indeed, there is no better method 
of inculcating in the children of America a respect for the ideals of 
the Colonists, their love for simplicity, truth and beauty, than by 
studying their homes, costumes, and the beautiful objects which 
they made to meet the needs of their lives. 
The Colonists placed a premium upon sound craftsmanship and 
dignified restraint in ornamentation and the craftsmen were so suc- 
cessful in meeting these demands that today we pay the greatest 
compliment that can be bestowed by placing their works in our 
Museums of Art as examples of good taste, and by reproducing 
their designs in architecture and home furnishings. 
It is customary to defer the study of Historic Art until the 
pupils enter the Senior High School when the subject is presented 
in sequence of periods from the prehistoric to modern times. Since 
so many children do not enter the High School, and of those who do, 
comparatively few elect art study, all children should learn something 
of the art of their own country, and the place to do this is in the 
grades of the elementary and intermediate school. Drawing pictures 
of incidents in the lives of the Colonists arouses a keener interest 
15 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  
in history and creates a vivid impression upon the mind of the 
child, thus proving an invaluable supplement to text book instruc 
tion. The method recommended for this illustrative drawing in- 
cludes directed study and free illustration. By directed study we 
mean the observation and sketching of the objects that enter into 
the final illustration. Preliminary study furnishes the pupils with 
the knowledge which is necessary to make their pictures historically 
correct. 
This method is not unlike that employed by the professional 
illustrator who, when he needs information to assist him in making 
his illustrations, resorts to his collection of photographs, pictures 
and sketches. 
Up to the present time the grade teacher has been handicapped 
by the lack of such reference material and “The American Renais- 
sance” plates are published to meet this need. 
Let us assume that a class has been studying Colonial History 
and the teacher has selected a subject suitable for the pupils to 
illustrate. They prepare themselves by sketching from plates the 
objects that will enter into the final composition. Enough of this 
practice should be given to develop definite visual memory so that 
the pupil is free to express his own interpretation of the story. The 
final illustrations will of course differ with each individual child, 
varying from crudeness through degrees of merit to excellence. It 
is no doubt true that more uniformity in the results would have .« 
been achieved if the pupils had copied a picture of some adult con- 
ception of the subject, but the development of the power to visualize 
and imagine would have been sacrificed thereby. 
In some communities very creditable results have been accom- 
plished in the dramatization of Colonial life by means of plays given 
in the school. The costumes and scenery were made by the pupils 
and Colonial furniture and other furnishings were loaned by inter- 
ested citizens in the neighborhood. The research work that the 
organization of these plays entailed proved an excellent training in 
appreciation of Colonial art and no doubt the vivid impressions and 
keen interest aroused by such dramatization would prove a won- 
derful stimulus for subsequent pictorial illustration. 
“The American Renaissance” plates, being authentic reproduc’ 
tions of Colonial costumes, interiors and accessories will prove very 
helpful in the organization of Colonial plays. 
The study of Colonial art from the standpoint of structural and 
16
-P-A-G-E-15
  decorative design may well begin in the higher elementary grades 
and the Junior High School and continue in the Senior High School. 
It is presumed that the principles of design have been so thoroughly 
taught in these grades that the pupils are prepared to intelligently 
analyze the beauty of Colonial art. However, since art is always 
a true expression of life, we should not overlook the importance of 
studying the causes which produced the distinctive types of design 
in each successive period. 
We may introduce the study of the Early Colonial period by 
describing the pioneer life of the Colonists; the hardships they en- 
dured for the sake of enjoying religious freedom; the development 
of resourcefulness and courage through overcoming obstacles; and 
above all the maintenance of ideals under the trials of adversity, all 
of which developed strength of character. We may then proceed 
to consider how these sturdy people constructed their crude log 
houses, fashioned their furniture, and made their homespun cloth- 
ing from the flax that they raised. These, with the few pieces of 
furniture and pewter ware which they brought with them from 
their former homes across the sea, sufficed for their immediate needs. 
It should be pointed out that in the struggle for existence there was 
little time or inclination to make things beautiful. Indeed, it sufficed 
if the homes protected them from the rigors of winter, and the fur- 
nishings met the needs of a simple life given to hard labor and self 
denial. Nevertheless, the first principles of good craftsmanship, 
sincerity, simplicity and strength in construction, were apparent in 
everything that the pioneers made. In reviewing the pioneer period, 
the teacher may use questions similar to the following: 
What sort of homes did the pioneer Colonists erect? In what 
manner did local conditions, such as climate and available materials, 
affect the early structures? Why were the windows of small size? 
What materials were substituted for glass in the windows? Why 
were the rooms small and low studded? How were the rooms 
heated? Why was a large fireplace necessary? Of what materials 
was the fireplace made? How was the floor of the log house 
treated? Name the pieces of furniture and describe the design of 
the chairs, chests and tables. What method of construction was 
observed in the furniture of log houses? Describe the costumes of 
the pioneers. How and of what materials were they made? How 
did the log house, its furnishings and the costume reflect the ideals 
and habits of the pioneer Colonists? What principles of crafts: 
manship were observed in pioneer construction? 
17
-P-A-G-E-16
Cottage Type Period 
A study of the first progressive steps in the development of a 
higher standard of living in the Colonies which was brought about 
by a desire for more homelike dwellings such as the Colonists had 
enjoyed in the mother country, together with more prosperous con- 
ditions, which succeeded the pioneer period, may be presented in 
the following manner. Make a comparative study of the pitch 
roof and gambrel roof houses which were typical of New England, 
noting the characteristic shape and proportions of each; the treat- 
ment of exterior walls and roof with clapboards and shingles; the 
location and scale of the windows, doors and chimneys. Proceed 
to observe and describe the interiors and furnishings; the proportion 
of the rooms; the size and location of the fireplace; the treatment 
of walls and ceilings; the types of furniture and their characteristic 
proportion and shape; the characteristic shapes of cooking utensils 
and pewter ware, candle sticks, lamps and lanterns. 
The salient features of the architecture in the Middle and 
Southern Colonies of this period may be described by the 
teacher from the text which explains the influences that climate, 
taste and customs of the people had upon the particular architect- 
ural style and materials employed in the homes in these sections of 
the country. 
Lessons in review upon the Cottage type period may be con- 
ducted by the teacher using such questions as the following: 
What state of mind and conditions of living prompted the 
Colonists to build the cottage type of home? Describe the charac 
teristics of these early homes in New England. How did they differ 
from the homes in the Middle and Southern Colonies? What con- 
ditions of climate and customs brought about these differences in 
the home architecture? Describe the appearance of the rooms in 
the pitch and gambrel roof houses. How were they heated and 
lighted? Why were these rooms low studded? Describe the furni- 
ture of this period. Of what materials was it made? What in- 
fluenced the design of this furniture? Where was most of the 
furniture made? Describe the method of cooking. What utensils 
were employed in cooking? Describe the table ware. What were 
the ingredients of pewter ware? Describe the characteristic struct- 
ural design of pewter ware. 
All of the foregoing information should be incorporated in an 
18
-P-A-G-E-17
  
art note book illustrated with the half tones and sketches by the 
pupils. 
Following the Early Period, proceed to study the transition be- 
tween the Early and Middle (Georgian) period which was brought 
about by a marked increase in wealth with the attendant desire to 
indulge the taste for a more pretentious domestic life. The teacher 
should have the pupils compare the illustrations of the Bennett 
Boardman and John Alden houses, examples of the early period of 
cottage architecture, with the Paul Revere house and Wayside Inn, 
which are typical of the more pretentious homes in the first phase 
of the Middle period. The pupils’ observation may be directed by 
the teacher asking them to explain the points of similarity and dif- 
ferences in both examples of pitch and gambrel roof houses under 
consideration. They may explain how the design of the houses 
reflects the status of prosperity in each period. 
A comparative study of the Tap Room and Kitchen with the 
Entrance Hall and Parlor of the Wayside Inn will reveal that transi- 
tion or change in style of the interiors and furnishings at this time 
was so gradual that frequently the two or more successive stylistic 
treatments existed in the same house. The teacher may explain that 
the influence upon the changing style of this period in New York, 
Pennsylvania and the South was manifest through the introduction 
of more decorative entrances of houses and the use of wall papers, 
imported rugs, and while Queen Anne furniture was popular in the 
Northern and Middle Colonies, the South preferred the French 
styles of furniture. 
There is no better evidence of the introduction of a more ornate 
and luxurious treatment in the rooms and furnishings in these latter 
day gambrel homes than is evident in Wayside hallway and parlor 
in which appear wall papers, rugs, painted woodwork, and Queen 
Anne chairs. These rooms are as typical of the Early Georgian as 
the tap room and kitchen are of the Early Jacobean period of simpler 
tastes when the walls were unpainted and unpapered; the ceilings 
constructed of timbers; the furniture of the stiff Jacobean style, 
the table ware of pewter, and the floors were either of plain wood 
or decorated with rag-rugs. 
Perhaps the most striking proof of the desire for comfort in the ? 
first phase of the Middle period will be revealed when the pupils — 
compare the Queen Anne chairs with their low wide seats and 
curved backs with the stiff straight chairs of the Jacobean style. (

  Middle Period (Georgian) 
Second Phase 
In taking up the study of the second phase of the Middle or 
Georgian period, it must be remembered that the preceding styles 
prevailed in some districts longer than in other localities, and that 
the poorer classes of citizens had to content themselves with houses, 
furniture and other furnishings of the simpler and less expensive 
styles used by their forefathers. The luxurious Georgian style was 
for the wealthier Colonists. 
A knowledge of Greek and Roman architectural structure and 
ornamentation is indispensable to an appreciation of the classic style 
which was the vogue in England and America during the Georgian 
period. It is therefore essential that the architectural features such 
as the pediment, lintel, arch, the three orders of columns, and such 
ornamental devices as the dentil and the egg and dart mouldings, 
anthemion and other motifs should be studied and sketched in the 
art note book from photographs or plates. 
We may introduce the subject of the American Renaissance or 
Georgian by explaining that this style which was inspired in Eng- 
land by Inigo Jones and Sir Christopher Wren, owing to its formal 
and impressive character was particularly well adapted to express 
the aristocratic development in the social life of the Colonies which 
began about 1750. A realization of the manifestation of this social 
status as reflected in the art of the period will be impressed upon the 
pupils when they study the plate illustrations. They may begin 
with the Craigie and Emerson houses, which are typical adaptations 
of the new style in New England. By comparing these the pupils 
will appreciate the more classic feeling in the design of the Craigie 
house, due to the use of the pilasters, the dentil moulding and pedi- 
ment. The proportions of this building are more harmonious and 
the use of a balustrade on the roof contributes greater distinction 
than is obtained in the Emerson house. We may proceed to observe 
what effect the new style produced upon the homes in the Middle 
Colonies of New York and Pennsylvania. It should be understood 
that the mansard roof was popular only in New England and that 
the Middle Colonies still clung to the Dutch and German influences 
in the main lines of their houses but adapted classic details as 
ornamental features of exteriors and interiors. The Jumel Mansion 
in New York was an exception to this rule. This structure more 
nearly resembles the Craigie house with the exception of the two- 
20
-P-A-G-E-19
    
story pediment front porch supported by columns and the omission 
of the side porches. In Cliveden will be observed the ornamental 
use of classic details of wood combined with the structure of stone 
which was general in Pennsylvania. The division of the primary 
mass of the facade into three vertical divisions, the central one, 
terminating at the top by a pediment and the use of the dentil 
moulding resembles the design of the Craigie house. However, the 
hipped roof construction and general proportions of Cliveden are 
essentially different. 
Comparison between the examples of the Georgian houses in 
the Southern Colonies with the Northern and Middle Colonies will 
reveal certain points of similarity of proportion and the use of classic 
columns supporting pediment roofed porches. It will also be noted 
that a projecting belt course of stone between the first and second 
stories was popular in Southern houses as well as in Pennsylvania. 
The hipped roof was characteristic of Southern architecture as well 
as that in Pennsylvania. 
In many Southern buildings, like Monticello and Mt. Vernon, 
the height was sacrificed for width which produced the effect of a 
one-story building. Westover is typical of buildings having a more 
vertical tendency. Toward the close of the Georgian period an- 
other variation in home architecture, known as the Flat-deck style, 
illustrated in the plate, became a vogue in New England and there 
are a few examples in the South. The superiority in design of the 
mansard and hipped roof houses will be made apparent when they 
are compared with the three-story box-like structures of the Flat- 
deck type. However, it will be observed that a certain degree of 
fe in the porches and roof balustrade is the saving grace of these 
ouses. 
Colonial Porches 
The entrance to Colonial houses forms a most fascinating and 
valuable study for children. There is so much variety and beauty 
in structural and ornamental treatment; they are so characteristic 
of the progress in Colonial living, and withal offer such a fine oppor- 
tunity for sketching that this subject should take an important place 
in the study of Colonial architecture. The teacher may introduce 
the subject by a description of classic architectural forms and an 
explanation of their adaptation, by the Colonial builders, to orna- 
mental purposes. It should be understood that the structural archi- 
21 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
    
tectural forms of Greece and Rome were used as details of ornament 
in the Renaissance movement in Europe as well as America. The 
pupils may proceed to study the doorway of the Col. Joseph Smith 
house, which is an example of the ornamental treatment of entrances 
in the Early period of pitch and gambrel roof houses. This will 
illustrate the use of the pilaster, gable and arch as decorative rather 
than structural motifs. The beautiful effect of the fan light window 
and panelling of the door should also be studied. The gable porch 
of the Bennett house is characteristic of the style that prevailed 
during the early part of the Georgian period and illustrates the 
transition between the decorated doorway of the Early period and 
the lintel roofed porch of the Middle and late Georgian period. 
The porch of the Phelps house is an excellent example of the final 
stage of development in sumptuousness of Georgian entrances. A 
comparison between these two styles of porches will present a fine 
opportunity for the pupils to appreciate and describe the more 
beautiful proportions of the structure and more effective ornamen- 
tation of the Phelps house porch. Particular attention should be 
directed to the graceful Colonial-arch transom over the door and 
window above the porch as well as the delicacy of the tracery in 
the fan light and side light windows at the entrance. 
Accompanying the study of doorways, the pupils should be 
encouraged to search for examples in the neighborhood of their 
homes. A great amount of interest may be aroused if the pupils 
observe these with the idea of describing them in the classroom by 
means of memory sketches. 
Interiors 
The decorative treatment of interiors during the Georgian period 
was quite in keeping with the elegance of the exteriors. 
The teacher should point out the fact that the styles in home 
interiors and furnishings heretofore were influenced by the reigning 
monarch in England and that this custom ceased in the Georgian 
period when styles were originated by such master craftsmen as 
Chippendale, Hepplewhite and Sheraton, and the Adam Brothers. 
The pupils will appreciate more fully the evolution in interior 
decoration if they compare the early examples, such as the living 
room in the Newington house with the living room in the Powell 
house and the ballroom in Gadsby’s Tavern. Have them describe 
the different treatments of the walls, fireplaces, mantels and door 
22
-P-A-G-E-21
  
ways. The teacher may direct this discussion by questions and 
finally explain the influence that the discoveries of Pompeii and 
Herculaneum had upon the design of the Adam Brothers and 
the adaptation of these classic motifs to the woodwork design in 
the later period of the Renaissance in America. This ornamental 
treatment of wreaths and festoons called for most skilful carving by 
Colonial craftsmen. Mention may be made of the remarkable 
achievements in this field by Samuel MacIntire of Salem, Massa- 
chusetts. 
Wall Paper and Textiles 
In the study of interior decoration of the Georgian period it 
should be explained that the desire for more sumptuous treatment 
of walls, which previously consisted of panelled wood, was satisfied 
by pictorial wall papers which were imported at first and later man- 
ufactured in the Colonies. The teacher may point out the fact that 
while this naturalistic design treatment would be inconsistent today, 
when it would serve as an inappropriate background for pictures, 
these scenic papers in the Georgian period took the place of pictures 
which had not come into general use. 
The fabrics used in interior furnishing in the Georgian and late 
Colonial periods that were imported from France were decorated 
in the same naturalistic manner as the wall papers. French sym- 
pathy with the Colonists prompted the designers to use allegorical 
motifs related to the Revolution. The teacher may explain the 
process of hand block printing in one color upon linen or cotton 
that was in use by Jouy and other manufacturers at that time. 
Furniture 
In presenting the study of Georgian furniture, the styles of 
which were set by the English cabinet makers, the teacher will find 
it advantageous to direct the pupils to follow the evolution in 
‘design from the Early period of Jacobean furniture through the 
transition period of William and Mary and Queen Anne furniture, 
and finally include the styles of the Georgian period. This pro- 
cedure will develop a logical comprehension of the changes in struc’ 
ture and ornamentation which developed gradually in response to 
the demand for more comfortable and elegant furniture befitting the 
23  
-P-A-G-E-22
  increase in prosperity with its accompanying social development. 
The points of similarity between the highboys and chairs of Queen 
Anne and Chippendale are quite obvious in the general features of 
structure and proportions, the main differences being due to richer 
ornamentation by means of carving, an art that Chippendale de- 
veloped to a high degree. His treatment in the design of chair backs 
was particularly distinguished. A comparison between the illustra- 
tions of Chippendale chairs will reveal the different styles that he 
produced, including the ladder back and cabriole leg varieties. Pupils 
may observe examples of Chippendale’s styles and learn to dis- 
tinguish between the Queen Anne, Louis XV and Chinese designs. 
The chief differences in proportion and ornamental treatment be- 
tween Chippendale, Hepplewhite and Sheraton furniture may be 
described by comparing the illustrations shown in the accompanying 
plates. 
When the pupils have become familiar with the chief charac 
teristics of the different styles of furniture design, the teacher may 
test their knowledge by having them identify examples in the shops, 
which generally have a good supply of the period styles. 
Clippings from catalogues and magazines are excellent for this 
purpose and may be placed in the art note book. 
Looking Glasses 
The looking glasses and mirrors of the Georgian period, owing 
to their simplicity and generally fine proportions, make them well 
adapted to the study of design. It is well to have the pupils first 
analyze the proportions of each mirror, then proceed to determine 
the relationship which the sub-divisions bear to the primary mass. 
The result of these observations should lead to an appreciation of 
those examples exhibiting the more subtle relations of proportion. 
Further study will disclose the manner of employing such archi- 
tectural elements as pilasters and mouldings in ornamenting the 
structure. The teacher may assist by directing the pupils’ attention 
to observe the harmonious relation of proportion between the deco- 
ration and the structure itself, and request an explanation of what 
determines the location of ornament upon the structural lines. This 
principle of the relation of ornament to structure is most important 
and should be emphasized throughout the study of Colonial objects. 
24
-P-A-G-E-23
  The difference between structural and applied decoration should 
also be clearly explained. It is well illustrated in the carved orna- 
ment of the frame and the painted decoration of scenes on the glass 
panels. Have the pupils compare and discuss the difference in these 
two methods of enrichment. They will have learned an important 
lesson if they discover for themselves that in the structural orna- 
mentation the design is worked into the material of which the object 
is composed while the applied ornament, as in the painting on the 
glass panels, is made up of a different material which is applied to 
the surface of the object. 
Pewter, Silver and Hardware 
A comparative study of the pewter ware of the Early period 
and the silverware of the Georgian period will reveal to the pupils 
the same evolution from extreme simplicity and ruggedness to re- 
finement and enrichment of form and richness of texture that is 
observed in other furnishings of these two phases in the development 
of Colonial life, which was a natural outcome of the change in ideals 
and living conditions. 
The silver tea pot and tankard by Paul Revere should be care- 
fully analyzed for the proportion of the primary mass and its sub- 
divisions; the proportion and shape of the appendages. The re- 
straint in the use of ornament and its harmonious relation to the 
structure of each object as well as the beautiful texture of the mate- 
rial employed, should be described. The search for other examples 
of Colonial silver in museums and reproductions in shops and cata- 
logues will extend the knowledge of these forms and develop greater 
interest and appreciation of this craft. 
The desire of Colonial craftsmen to make architecture and fur- 
niture beautiful was also observed in the designing of even the 
objects of lesser importance. Door knockers, hinges, footscrapers, 
iron railings and fences and fireplace fittings are as beautiful in their 
way as are the architecture and more pretentious furnishings. 
Owing to the simplicity and beauty of proportion, line and 
shape that are embodied in these objects, the teacher will find them 
admirably adapted to the study of structural design. They will 
also make excellent models for free-hand drawing since they are 
suited to the technical ability of the pupils.

Colonial Painting 
The study of Colonial painting may well begin with its use in 
decorating mirrors and clocks, in the early development of the 
Georgian period. These quaint beginnings in the art are more in- 
teresting from an historical rather than an artistic point of view. 
The art of portrait and figure painting, however, is a significant 
chapter in Colonial art of latter half of the eighteenth and early 
part of the nineteenth centuries. 
In presenting this subject to the pupils the teacher should ex- 
plain that the development of portrait painting in America was 
the outcome of the prosperous times preceding the Revolution and 
the demand for portraits to commemorate the great statesmen and 
military leaders of the War period. 
It may also be pointed out that the American artists, because 
of the lack of art instruction in America, were forced to study 
abroad and thus came under the influence of such great English 
portrait painters as Sir Joshua Reynolds and Gainsborough. This re- 
lationship thus established a high standard of craftsmanship which 
no doubt explains the fine achievements of such artists as Copley, 
Stuart and others. The interesting incidents in the lives of these 
men may be read by the teacher from the chapter in the manual 
upon painting. This will reveal how these pioneer artists learned 
to overcome obstacles and will give information upon the methods 
that they employed in their art. 
The pupils may now proceed to study the illustrations to discover 
which artists developed the greatest success in delineation of char- 
acter and technique. 
Colonial Churches and Public Buildings 
Colonial architecture is essentially domestic in character owing 
to the limited number of public buildings in the early history of 
America. The study of Colonial architecture nevertheless would 
be incomplete without including churches and such buildings as the 
Independence Hall in Philadelphia and the old State House in 
Boston, Massachusetts. There are many beautiful examples of 
churches still remaining in New England and other sections of the 
country. These edifices show the influence of medieval architecture 
in England and Sir Christopher Wren’s style which combined the 
elements of Gothic and Renaissance architecture. 
26 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  
The main structure of these churches was built of wood or 
brick; the window casings, doorways, tower and steeple were of 
wood. The main body of the building was rectangular in floor 
plan with a gable roof construction. The pupils will be interested 
in making a comparison between three typical examples of Colonial 
churches, representing the Northern style in the Old North Church; 
the style of the Middle Colonies in the Saint Peter’s Protestant 
Episcopal Church and the Southern style in the Bruton Parish 
Church. 
The distinguishing features of the Old North Church are the 
Gothic steeple supported by a square tower ornamented with 
Renaissance details, all of which is typical of Sir Christopher 
Wren’s English churches. 
The fine proportion between tower and spire and the har- 
monious space relations of the tower sections should be noted. The 
gradual progression of measures between the main tower and the 
spire which contributes the element of grace in the New England 
churches is wanting in the St. Peter’s church which was patterned 
after medieval English churches. The transition between the tower 
and spire in St. Peter’s is more abrupt, giving an appearance of 
ruggedness which is more like the Bruton parish church. However, 
there is a majestic effect in St. Peter’s and the spire is considered 
to be one of the most beautifully proportioned in America. 
The Bruton parish church which like St. Peter’s shows the in- 
fluences of churches in medieval England, has a transept which was 
a characteristic feature of many Southern churches. The general 
effect of the tower is massive and severe; while it does not compare 
favorably from an architectural standpoint with churches in the 
North, it has a rugged picturesque quality. 
The interiors of Colonial churches are well worth studying. 
The white woodwork of the walls and pews, and the classic or- 
namentation of the interior which was always restrained, gives an 
atmosphere of cheerful dignity which was most appropriate for a 
house of worship. The few public buildings in the Colonies were 
located in the larger centers. 
Faneuil Hall and the old State House in Boston, and Indepen- 
dence Hall in Philadelphia, are the most important and picturesque 
as well as the most noted from an historical standpoint. 
In comparing the old State House and Independence Hall, the 
pupils will observe that the general proportions of the primary mass 
of these buildings differs considerably. The former building is 
narrow and the height exceeds the width while in the latter the 
27 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
    width exceeds the height. There are some points of similarity in 
the towers of these buildings although it will be noted that in In- 
dependence Hall the tower is located in front of the facade and in 
the old State House the tower rises from the center of the roof. 
The Dutch stepped gable with lion and unicorn ornaments is an 
unusual feature in Colonial buildings. The Palladian window over 
the main entrance of Independence Hall is most effective detail. 
In localities where examples of Colonial churches and buildings exist, 
the pupils should compare them with the illustrations and describe 
their points of similarity and differences. 
The Late Colonial (Empire) 
1795 to 1814 
The important developments of the late Colonial period which 
should be studied were the adoption of Greek-Roman temple style 
in home architecture and the so-called Empire furniture which were 
introduced in America through the awakened interest in Greek and 
Roman history and the influence due to the friendly attitude of 
America toward France during the Napoleonic period when the 
Empire styles were the rage in France. 
In the North, the mansard and flat-decked houses persisted with 
here and there a Greek-temple house or public building. The latter 
style was more popular in the South and where the large estates 
made a more fitting setting for the building. A study of the 
“Arlington” house will reveal the similarity of this style to a Greek 
temple of the Doric period combined with Roman arched windows. 
The Empire furniture in America differed from that of France 
owing to the influence of Latrobe, an architect in Washington, who 
simplified his designs by omitting the applied brass ornaments which 
were used on French furniture of this style. The characteristics 
of American Empire may be studied from the illustrations of the bed 
in the chamber of the Wayside Inn and the davenport in Nos. 39 
and 45. The pupils will note the massiveness of the former piece 
and the beautiful French roll at the foot and back. This same grace 
of curve is noticeable in the davenport of lighter proportions. 
The student having become familiar with the distinguishing 
features of the various styles of architecture, furniture and other 
objects of each period in Colonial history is prepared to consider 
what influence they have exerted upon modern architecture and 
28
-P-A-G-E-27
furnishings. Homes and buildings of Colonial design are not difficult 
to find and our shops and homes are full of copies of Colonial 
furniture and tableware. The magazines frequently contain pic- 
tures of Colonial art objects and these may help to make the art 
note books more complete. 
The student of “The American Renaissance” will find the fol- 
lowing list of books of the greatest value for supplementary reading:

In following the development of costume design, we have in- 
cluded herewith a list of reference books many of which can be 
found in any local library. 
The drawings of the late Howard Pyle are especially recom- 
mended for classroom study. This peerless artist devoted a life 
time to the portrayal of the manners and customs of Colonial days. 
His pictures, aside from their splendid drawing and composition, 
reveal a careful study of the various materials used in the costumes 
of the period. He painted a fold in a dress again and again until 
he was satisfied that the result accurately expressed the texture. 
He has painted for children a delightful picture of the early days 
in Virginia in his book “Jack Ballister’s Fortunes,” and his illustra’ 
tions for the late Dr. $8. Weir Mitchell’s classic “Hugh Wynne, 
Free Quaker,” transports us back to the stirring times of the Revo- 
lution. This book is the result of years of study on the part of the 
author and gives a precise idea of life in Philadelphia one hundred 
and fifty years ago. The description of the “Mischianza” is espe- 
cially interesting, as it presents the social life of the British occu- 
pancy of the city and introduces the illstarred Major André who 
designed the costumes for that historic pageant. 
Among other books which combine fiction and history in a way 
that will appeal to children may be noted the following:

GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
ARCHITECTURE AND DECORATION 
The study of the arts of our forefathers so clearly reflects the 
social conditions under which they lived and developed that one may 
almost visualize without actual observation the very belongings with 
which the early settlers surrounded themselves by a study of the 
character and customs of the people. The local influences such as 
climate and natural products and the means of protection, first 
against the Indian and later against the white man as divisions of 
opinion developed, are also important factors in the formation of 
early American art. 
The pioneers who arrived both in New England and Virginia 
in the early part of the seventeenth century brought with them what 
household goods for which they could find room in the limited 
space of the early ships. The pieces of furniture brought in these 
ships were largely boxes and chests which were used to carry their 
clothing and household equipment. There is evidence that a few 
brought such pieces as cupboards, chairs, cooking and eating utensils 
which they knew would not be found in the new land of their 
choice, but which were necessary even for the most rudimentary 
living conditions. 
The early pioneers of New England were usually of the yeo- 
manry class, vigorous and sturdy individualists who preferred to 
embark toward the unknown rather than continue an existence 
under the then unhappy political conditions in England of the first 
James and Charles. While many of the same type of persons also 
went to Virginia and the Southern States from an early date, the 
population in these sections was also made up of the nobility and 
wealthier classes who had been accustomed to a more leisurely mode 
of living at home and who had been surrounded with the customary 
credentials of culture. These refinements they still required, and 
since there were no means at hand for the manufacture of the neces- 
sities of life, an early import trade developed with England in the 
then prevailing types of household furnishings and personal adorn- 
ment. : 
The early New Englander, however, untrained though he was 
in many of the crafts, through sheer necessity commenced to manu- 
31 
   
-P-A-G-E-30
  facture at home the many articles that were needed by himself and 
family. At first his efforts were confined to copying the original 
models brought from England by his friends and relatives. The 
original models eventually wore out through usage and there were 
not enough to supply the increasing demand caused by the rapid 
growth of the Colonies. The proficiency of the amateur craftsmen 
developed to the point where they were prepared to try new forms, 
new materials and new colors, that were either more easily obtain- 
able or more suitable to the gradually improving social conditions. 
This evolution and its results developed a new style which is 
generally termed today the “Early American”. It is, however, a 
broad generalization to give it this name. The consecutive develop- 
ment of the hand-made products of the early Colonies is most difh- 
cult to follow. Similar forms were made at distant points covering 
a period of several generations and forms were often copied many 
years later in localities far from their origin. 
The first settlers upon landing erected the rudest kind of log 
shelters cut from the virgin forests of the new land, but which 
stoutly served their purpose to guard the occupants from the 
elements as well as from the flint arrow heads of the hostile redskins. 
As soon as several crops had been gathered, however, the log huts 
were replaced with more attractive frame buildings constructed of 
heavy hand-hewn posts and girders, covered with pine clap-boards. 
The few remaining examples of the earliest dwellings show that they 
were distinctly influenced by the half timber houses of Jacobean and 
Elizabethan England with the exception that plaster and mortar, 
not being available, were not used to fill in the cracks and shrink 
ages of the wood so that the wintry blasts must have entered the 
dwellings without much resistance. The only provision that the 
settlers made to overcome the disagreeable effects of this form of 
construction was by the erection of huge fireplaces that today would 
seem unnecessarily large considering the size of the rooms. In 
order to retain all the heat possible the window openings were small 
and the ceilings were extremely low. This latter requirement was 
not so essential in the Southern Colonies. 
Glass was scarce and came only in small sizes. Oiled paper was 
at first used and the effect of leaded glass of Gothic and Tudor 
England was often reproduced in this country by small diamond 
shaped panes divided with small wooden sash bars instead of the 
metal. The interior walls and floors were usually wide planks cut 
from the largest trees of the locality and left in the widths of the 
32
-P-A-G-E-31
logs. The wall planks were usually set vertically and were tongued 
and grooved to seal the rooms as tightly as possible. Mouldings 
were sometimes used to cover the joints between the planks and 
take care of any shrinkage. When plaster was available it was 
used only on the exterior walls of the house. The interior parti- 
tions were the only walls covered with wood. Toward the end of 
the seventeenth century, wood panelling commenced to be substi- 
tuted for the planking. 
The focal point of interest in the home was the fireplace which 
served not only to heat the house but also was used for all cooking 
purposes. The swinging crane with its kettle and the turning spit 
was a part of the equipment of every house. When iron was scarce, 
the kettle hung from a tree trunk set well up the chimney flue to 
escape the heat from the roaring fire of the great logs below, but 
many a time the flames licked the support until the kettle with its 
contents came crashing down upon the hearth and spoiled the pros- 
pect of the feast. A whole art in itself was developed in the fire- 
place accessories. Fire-dogs, irons, tools, foot-warmers, kettle 
stands, bed-warmers, hearth-brooms and countless other useful and 
interesting objects were invented, many of which are not only 
picturesque today but objects of great intrinsic beauty. 
Generally speaking, the early type of art is best represented 
today by the household furniture of the period. Most of the 
architecture has disappeared through the ravages of time, but the 
furniture, being protected from the weather and sturdy as it was, 
has come down to us in numerous examples. The details of the 
carvings and turnings were usually crude and large. The woods 
used were those cut from the local trees. Oak, chestnut, white pine 
and maple and fruit woods seemed to be the most suitable and 
available for the cabinet maker. 
The furniture was usually left unfinished and rubbed with bees- 
wax, which added an agreeable lustre or “Patina”. The earliest 
forms were the chest, cupboard, writing-box, trestle-table, and vari- 
ous shapes of chairs. The date of the latter may be approximated 
by the design of the back. The turned, spindle, and ladder-backs 
preceded the slat and banister backs, later followed by the Windsor 
in a variety of forms. Most of the chairs had rush seats. 
Practically all of this early furniture was built primarily for use 
and durability. Ornamentation was meagre. Carving was often of 
the scratch work variety and inlay was rarely employed. The 
charm today of early American objects lies in its sincere and lovely 
33
-P-A-G-E-32
Me So rr ce mn ee ee raga ra Beery ee ier © et 
simplicity expressing as it does the Spartan-like lives of the early 
settlers, with their strict adherence to principles. Comfort was not 
considered until the problems of the pioneer had been met and 
conquered and the first evidences that we have are probably to be 
found in the early Windsor chairs that were designed to fit the 
human form instead of the stiff straight lines of the Brewster and 
Carver types that came over in the first ships to Plymouth. 
Upholstery work as we know it today was not used during this 
period. One of the interesting paradoxes however was found in 
the use of the fine imported damasks, brocades and velvets often 
found on loose cushions for the seats of the crude wooden chairs 
and benches. Small quantities of these foreign fabrics were easily 
brought over in ships, and seemed to be in great demand. Domestic 
materials of the homespun variety were common and according to 
many of the old inventories “Turkey Work” was a popular uphol- 
stering material. This was a hand woven high pile fabric made | 
on canvas backing in colored wool following a pattern that was 
crudely copied from an Oriental rug. 
The floor coverings were usually of the rag carpet or braided 
rug variety. The hooked rug as far as we know did not come into 
existence until the latter part of the eighteenth century. 
The early American period of the decorative art draws to a close 
about the middle of the eighteenth century when the wealth of the 
Colonies increased and the novelty of the importations from Eng- 
land and France commenced to obtain a stronger footing with the 
wealthy classes. 
About 1720 mahogany came into use in England and was found 
to have remarkable adaptability to the making of furniture. It 
had a fine grain, which could be carved into the most delicate orna- 
mentation, was extremely strong, had a new and interesting color, 
and made a handsome appearance. It held its shape without warping 
or shrinkage in all seasons of the year. Its popularity was greatly 
enhanced by the Chippendales who were not only artists and cabinet 
makers of great versatility but who applied modern selling methods 
for their wares and created a popular demand that spread over both 
hemispheres. 
The Middle Colonial or Georgian period extends from the early 
period until the Revolution. It corresponds to the “Georgian” 
period of England and the two are so closely related that the latter 
appelation is often used in designating both the architecture and the 
industrial art products made in this country during the period fol- 
lowing 11750, although the characteristics appeared in isolated in- 
34  
-P-A-G-E-33
  stances almost a half century before this date. This period in 
England developed under strong French and Italian influences due 
to the research made in those countries by the leading English art- 
ists, architects and designers. 
The new trade routes of the British and other European navi- 
gators also caused an influx of products from the Far East. The 
art of the Orient made a strong impression upon the English people 
and while it had no effect upon the exterior architecture, its influ 
ence upon interior decoration and furnishing seems to have been 
considerable. The rich silks and embroideries of China were not 
only new textiles but the unique patterns that had never been seen 
before were reproduced in domestic materials. The painted paper 
that was used for wall decoration was made first in England and 
France by the hand block process, in imitation of the Chinese de- 
signs, and later in frankly Occidental adaptations. Wall paper 
became an article of common usage. The porcelain and china 
ware of the East became the rage for the wealthy and many of the 
finest examples were brought to fill the shelves and decorate the 
mantels of English homes. Chinese lacquer work also became pop- 
ular and although the process was carefully guarded by the Orientals 
for a great number of years, it was finally brought to Europe by a 
Dutchman and employed for decorative purposes by all of the great 
European cabinet makers. These influences made themselves 
strongly felt throughout the Colonies but received such changes as 
were bound to be made by designers unacquainted with the originals 
and working with tools and material quite different from those used 
by the European designers. 
Wood was the principal material used in Colonial interiors and 
being subject to more delicate carving and ornamentation and hav- 
ing structural qualities which permitted graceful forms, a new art 
was created by the Colonists which was a much more serious 
attempt at sophisticated design than anything that had been. 
The most noticeable difference in the architecture during the 
change from early American to the Georgian type was the transi- 
tion from the picturesque to an attempt at formality by symmetry 
in design and the introduction of academic details. Columns, pil- 
asters, cornices, arches, pediments and other methods of elaboration 
were employed. 
The detail of the Italian renaissance became the property of the 
country carpenter by the means of the printing press. Additional 
charm in many of the details was produced by many local variations 
of the academic types, each journeyman adding his personal touch 
35 
   
-P-A-G-E-34
  to the proportion of Palladio and Vignola. These new forms were 
used in doorways, windows, mantels and other parts of the house 
that required accenting. 
Although the major portion of all domestic dwellings in New 
England and New York had always been constructed of wood, 
there were also constructed, in the Middle and Southern Colonies, 
many structures of brick and stone which, owing to their durability, 
have been preserved in excellent condition. 
The earliest attempts at formal architecture are found along the 
river banks of Virginia and the Carolinas where by 1750 the social 
life had developed to a point which was nearly the equal of that in 
the old country. Letters and diaries of foreigners who visited our 
shores and were entertained by the leading families of these sec 
tions give most glowing accounts of the wealth and luxury that was 
found and the cordial manner in which they had been treated. 
The use of applied and free standing orders with a fairly accu 
rate appreciation of Roman proportions is found not only in the 
stone architecture but also in the wooden types. Much of this 
can be directly traced to existing English prototypes. Doorways 
and entrances received important consideration and pedimented 
forms in their many variations became popular. A local tendency 
in some quarters is noticeable in the elongation of columns and pil- 
asters and an increase in the number of mouldings used in the 
entablatures. 
Academic architecture was also transferred to the interiors of 
houses and toward the latter portion of the eighteenth century the 
designers seem to have had not only a thorough conception of classic 
detail but were adept in applying it to new materials and to the 
local conditions. An art that is truly American was created. 
The most important change in the furniture of this period was 
the rather swift adaptation of Chippendale forms. Copies of Chip- 
pendale’s “Gentleman’s and Cabinet-maker’s Directory” found 
their way to this country. Mahogany was more readily obtainable 
in this country even than in England. Boat loads came from San 
Domingo and other islands of the West Indies. Original Chippen- 
dale models and copies were brought here for reproduction. Furni- 
ture and cabinet makers were established in full force particularly 
in the North and by 1760 the development toward the pierced splat 
backs, the cabriole leg and ball and claw foot was firmly intrenched. 
The interior architectural treatment also shows a gradual change. 
The wainscot and panelled rooms of the earlier period were contin- 
ued in connection with scenic wall paper. Stairs and stair halls 
36
-P-A-G-E-35
  which gave the visitor his first and last impression of the house were 
generously treated. The houses became the very embodiment of 
welcome. Hand carved balusters and newel posts were often the 
pride of the craftsman and owner. Mantels were remarkable for 
their delicacy of ornament and detail, much of which eventually 
strongly reflected the Pompeiian work of Robert and James Adam 
in England. In occasional instances we find some evidence of French 
rococo carving. 
The Revolution halted to a certain extent the interest in home 
surroundings. The wealth and thoughts of the people were turned 
in other directions. During the period there lived and worked at 
the upper end of Maiden Lane, New York City, a cabinet maker of 
repute by the name of Marinus Willett. This Marinus Willett’s 
great-grandfather, Thomas Willett, was the first Mayor of New 
York. The Mayoral duties in time of need were abandoned for 
soldiering. In 1758 Thomas Willett took an active part in the 
expedition against Fort Ticonderoga, and in New York, was one 
of the most active spirits in defense of liberty. “Like father, like 
son,” Marinus Willett was also a patriot. On June 6th, 1775, at 
the corner of Broad and Beaver Streets, Marinus seized the wagons 
containing arms to be shipped to the British troops in Boston. 
As in the case of Paul Revere, Willett and his fellow craftsmen 
left their workshops when the call came and, with others of their 
trade, whose names unfortunately are obscure, did their share 
toward the establishment of this great United States. 
With the final settlement at Yorktown, far reaching cultural 
and political movements occurred. France who had been our ally 
was in the throes of an upheaval. The people were in the midst of 
a struggle for Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. The sympathy of 
our own new Republic, struggling for a firm foundation, naturally 
was with the people of France who were endeavoring to throw off 
the shackles of unreasonable control. In searching for other ideals 
of democracy the models of ancient Rome and Greece were brought 
to the fore by both statesmen and philosophers. All of these events 
were reflected in the art development of the nation. A much closer 
alliance to pure classic form was noticeable. The use of the bor- 
rowed details that had come through England via the Renaissance 
in Italy were gradually discontinued. The Grecian and Roman 
“temple” type of architecture was revived, although it was not 
until about 1825 during the Greco-Turkish war that the true 
“Greek Revival’ commenced. The planning of the houses also 
37 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  showed a marked change. Rooms became more spacious, with 
higher ceilings. Round, oval and octagonal plans were introduced. 
In common with the architecture, the furniture and metal work 
took on new forms, although these were slower to throw off the 
tradition of English design. Sheraton, Hepplewhite, Shearer and 
others, all of whom issued books of design, had their followers in 
great number. William Savery of Philadelphia was the leader of a 
local group who for some time remained faithful to the Chippen- 
dale forms. Duncan Phyfe of New York, a prolific cabinet maker 
whose wealthy clients enabled him to organize a large manufactury, 
followed the demand of the public. His early work from the point 
of view of design was strongly of Sheraton feeling. His use of 
satin wood and other inlays gave his furniture great popularity. He 
was a sufficient artist himself, however, to originate motifs and lines 
of great merit, but he was sorely tried at times in being forced to 
reflect the popular taste which continually grew worse and finally 
completely submerged his ideals. 
Beginning with the first decade of the nineteenth century, the 
“Empire” period of furniture and decoration was introduced. This 
consisted of a rather rudimentary expression of the style that was 
prevalent in France under Napoleon, shorn however of much of its 
elaboration. The general tendency was toward heaviness of details; 
almost to a point of clumsiness. Mahogany was used to a large 
extent in furniture and large flat surfaces were introduced where 
possible to exhibit the natural graining of the wood work. 
Coincident with the wave of patriotism that stirred the hearts 
of the early founders of the Republic, the American eagle, the 
symbol of the new nation, is often seen as an ornament of both 
exterior and interior architecture and decoration. This is often 
known as the “American eagle period” and lasted until well after 
the War of 1812. 
The close of the first quarter of the ninteenth century brings to 
an end what may be termed the “American Renaissance” and marks 
the transition from the handmade product to the machine made. 
The early blows of an age of industrialism temporarily struck to the 
ground in practically every civilized nation on the globe, the love 
of beauty among the people, thereby crushing the natural develop- 
ment of art. It has taken nearly a century for a popular apprecia- 
tion to reassert itself, and in the eclecticism of modern times, lies 
the hope of the future.

DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING PLATES 
No. 1. BENNETT-BOARDMAN HOUSE 
Saugus, Massachusetts. 1651 
Although it is possible that the shelters of the earliest white 
people of America were at first rude huts constructed of sod and 
thatch, this type of accommodation was soon superceded by wood 
construction. 
The next step consisted of the grouping of tree trunks in a 
vertical position to form a wall. The spaces between the trunks 
were filled with mud and the roofs continued to be thatched with 
boughs and leaves. This afforded a considerably larger and more 
habitable dwelling. It gave better protection from the weather and 
the hostile Indian. This method of construction is known as the 
“Palisade” type. There are however no extant remains of houses 
of this form and they were rapidly followed by the framed type 
in which the frame consisted of heavy posts, girts, plates, studs 
and summer beam with a surface covering of clap boards. This 
type usually had a chimney in the center, built of rough masonry. 
In Virginia we find much of the same form of construction with 
chimneys built either end. 
The Bennett-Boardman house is an excellent example of the 
pitch roofed type of architecture that was popular throughout 
the New England Colonies. It represents the first effort of the 
Colonists to erect more homelike structures than the crude log 
houses of the pioneer period. While this cottage type is extremely 
simple and unpretentious, reflecting the simple living of the times, 
yet is one of the most picturesque houses in America. The c chief 
structural characteristic is the sharp pitch roof elongated at the rear 
The overhanging second story on the front of the Bennett house was 
a measure adopted for defense against Indian attacks, which enabled _ 
the inmates to fire through loop holes upon anyone who attempted. 
to batter down the door. The feature of construction persisted long 
after the Indians ceased to be a menace. It contributed an element 
of variety in the design of the structure which no doubt appealed 
to the Colonists. The clap boards and shingles of these houses as 
well as the nails were made by hand. The entrance halls in these 
39
-P-A-G-E-38
  early homes were made narrow to keep the cold air from chilling 
the living rooms. The rooms were low studded so that they could 
be heated more easily by the huge fireplaces which were placed near 
the centre of the building. The Colonists had learned from experi- 
ence that much of the heat could be conserved by constructing the 
chimney to extend through the interior of the house. 
The simplicity of the exterior of this pitch roofed dwelling is 
reflected in the interior and its furnishings which were devoid of 
ornamentation. Hand hewn timbers supported the second story 
and were exposed to view; the walls consisted of boarding placed 
vertically. In later examples of this style of architecture we find 
panelled and painted walls, which added much to the appearance 
of the rooms. No doubt these early homes were looked upon 
as quite an achievement in comparison with the crude log houses 
of their fathers. 
From the view point of modern architecture they possessed a 
quaint charm probably unsuspected by the sturdy people of those 
days. 
No. 2. JOHN ALDEN HOUSE 
Duxbury, Massachusetts. Circa 1666 
This house which is known as the house of John and Priscilla 
Alden was built in 1666 and is of a type similar to the Boardman 
house at Saugus with the central chimney dividing two rooms on 
the ground floor. The entrance in the middle of the front opens 
into a small hallway in which is located a steep stairway to the attic. 
This example however shows the gambrel type of roof having 
a double pitch on each side. This was used to give additional head 
room in the second floor. 
Practically all of the early houses were built directly on the 
ground. The simple stone foundation was laid without mortar in 
a trench and brought only a few inches above grade. The early 
floors were tamped earth mixed with sand. This eventually gave 
way to the stone floor and was followed by hand-hewn planks of 
oak, pine or chestnut. 
Later the gambrel type of house developed into two stories with 
large comfortable rooms on each floor. Porches were added giving 
a more decorative effect to the structure.

No. 3. PAUL REVERE HOUSE 
Boston, Massachusetts. Circa 1676 
The house occupied by Paul Revere from about 1770 until 1800 
was an old house when Revere moved into it. It was built soon 
after the fire that ravaged Boston in 1676 along the line of con- 
struction that was prevalent in the country districts of England at 
that time. The projecting second story and the small diamond 
shaped panes of glass show the last vestiges of the Gothic influence 
that often persisted in even the simplest of structures for many 
years after the Renaissance had really begun. 
The House is located on North Street, in the oldest section of 
Boston, and was originally surrounded with dignified mansions and 
towering trees. It is now in the heart of the Italian section of the 
city in the midst of business buildings. 
The fame of Paul Revere, to the average American, lies in his 
midnight ride to Lexington, some fifteen miles out of Boston, to 
warn the Patriots of the advance of the British troops. After he 
had seen the previously arranged signals of the lights placed in the 
spire tower of Old North Church notifying him that the British 
were crossing the river to Charlestown in their march on Lexington 
and Concord, he and his two companions took their waiting steeds 
and galloped through the darkness notifying each householder to 
gather for resistance and mutual protection. 
His versatility extended far beyond his ability for leadership and 
patriotism. While both the history and the romance of his ride 
will forever be preserved for us by Longfellow’s poem, Revere 
could have rested his fame alone in the lovely products in silver 
ware that were turned out in his foundry. His ability as an artist 
and engraver was no less. He often used his talents to express his 
opinion on the activities of the day and particularly to protest 
against the tyrannical actions on the part of the British military 
leaders. His most famous engraving is the “Boston Massacre of 
1770” and it was from the upper windows of his home that Revere 
showed the “awful” pictures of the massacre which, we read, struck 
the assembly of spectators “with solemn silence” while their coun- 
tenances were covered with a “melancholy gloom” and well might 
they have shuddered. In the middle window appeared a realistic 
view of the massacre. In the north window was shown the “Gen- 
ius of Liberty”, a sitting figure holding aloft a liberty cap and

trampling under foot a soldier hugging a serpent, the emblem of 
military tyranny. In the south window was an obelisk displaying 
the names of the five victims in front of which was a bust of the boy 
Snider killed a few days before in a struggle in front of a Tory 
shop; and behind the bust a shadowy, gory figure with these lines 
beneath: 
“Snider’s pale ghost fresh bleeding stands 
And Vengeance for his death demands.” 
No. 4. HOUSE OF SEVEN GABLES 
Salem, Massachusetts. Circa 1670 
The “Turner House” better known as the “House of Seven 
Gables” of Nathaniel Hawthorne has gone through a considerable 
series of transformations during its long term of existence. It is 
an example however of the type of early house that was erected 
with a trace of the gothic influence of Tudor England. Gables 
are wre distinctly of medieval origin and a close connection exists be 
tween gables in the front of a house and dormer windows which are 
built up from the roof. The object of both was of course to give 
greater height in the second story and to bring daylight into the 
space underneath the rafters. The old gables and dormers were 
both called “‘lucomes” or “Lucome windows”, a word we often find 
in descriptions of the period. The term “gable” also refers to the 
end wall of structures having pitched roofs. 
The interior of this famous house is even more interesting than 
the exterior. A secret stairway entered from the rear of a closet 
and built with steep ascent within the brick chimney is a feature 
that is found in many of the early dwellings along the coast and 
gives ample evidence of the smuggling propensities of the inhabi- 
tants. 
The furnishings of the interior are in much the same condition 
as they were when Hawthorne associated them with the characters 
in his novel.

  No. 5. HANCOCK-CLARKE HOUSE 
Lexington, Massachusetts. Circa 1760 
The old house that stood just off the Common at Lexington is 
an example of the less pretentious form of residence of pre-Revo- 
lutionary days. It was evidently erected by a builder who little 
appreciated the advantages of good proportions and was evidently 
intent upon erecting a shelter. Many houses of this character were 
erected without building plans. The general overall dimensions 
were given the carpenter, who proceeded with the work with only 
verbal instructions as to the number and arrangement of rooms that 
were to be placed on each floor. 
The Hancock-Clarke house has been moved across the street 
from its original location. It is more interesting on account of its 
historic associations than to any architectural merit. It originally 
belonged to the Reverend John Hancock, the grandfather of the 
signer of the Declaration of Independence, and was later owned by 
his successor in the pulpit, the Reverend Jonas Clarke. Here John 
Hancock and Samuel Adams were stopping the night before the 
battle of Lexington. They were roused at midnight from their 
sleep by Paul Revere, when they were taken by their guard to 
Captain James Reed’s house in Burlington, thus escaping capture 
by the British troops who were marching from Charlestown with 
the Tory Governor's orders for their arrest. 
No. 6. THE WAYSIDE INN 
Sudbury, Mass. Early 18th Century 
“As ancient is this hostelry 
As any in this land may be: 
Built in the old Colonial day 
When men lived in a grander way. 
With ampler hospitality 
A kind of old Hobgoblin Hall, 
Now somewhat fallen in decay 
With weather stains upon the wall, 
And stairways worn and crazy doors, 
And creaking and uneven floors, 
And chimneys huge and tiled and tall.” 
This was written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in 1862 
44
-P-A-G-E-43
in his “Tales of a Wayside Inn.” The old building stands today 
much as it did when Longfellow rendered it immortal. Thanks to 
the interest taken by Mr. Henry Ford of Detroit to preserve it to 
posterity, it is probably in a better condition than it appeared to be 
in 1862. 
The original building was erected by a family named Howe in 
the early part of the 18th century. It remained in their hands 
for upwards of one hundred and fifty years, during which time 
many changes and additions were made. The present exterior 
shows that alterations have been made in recent years, probably to 
preserve it from destruction. Unfortunately, they have not in all 
cases added to the charm of the general aspect that one obtains from 
its’ approach, but a sufficient quantity of its picturesqueness is 
retained to make it the most interesting extant example of a colonial 
hostelry. 
The illustration of the front facade hardly gives an adequate 
idea of the size of the group. Several wings have been added with 
particular disregard of the roofing. These may be seen from the 
garden side. (See No. 47.) 
No. 7. THE CRAIGIE HOUSE 
Cambridge, Massachusetts. Circa 1760 
It would be difficult to find a finer example of the mansard 
type of architecture than the Craigie house presents. The design 
was inspired by a desire of the wealthier classes in New England for 
more pretentious homes commensurate with the higher standard 
of living which they had adopted at this time. 
In appearance the Craigie house is more formal and impressive 
than prevailing cottage types that preceded the mansard style. The 
use of pediments, pilasters, dentil mouldings as important decorative 
features contributed a classic feeling wholly in keeping with the 
distinguished proportions of the primary mass, its sub-divisions and 
appendages. Emphasis of the horizontal line of the roof and the 
symmetrical balance in the general arrangement are contributing 
factors to this effect of formality. 
This house has an interesting history for not only was it the 
headquarters of General Washington at the time he became Com- 
mander-in-Chief of the Revolutionary forces but it was also the 
abode of the poet Longfellow who here wrote the immortal stanzas 
of “The Children’s Hour.”

“Between the dark and the daylight, 
When the night is beginning to lower, 
Comes a pause in the day’s occupations, 
That is known as the Children’s hour.” 
During Longfellow’s occupancy it became the center of the 
literary life of Cambridge. It was here, while dining with the 
poet, that Nathaniel Hawthorne told Longfellow the story of 
“Evangeline.” 
No. 8. EMERSON HOUSE 
Concord, Massachusetts. Circa 1830 
On hearing the name of the little town of Concord, Mass., so 
many important historic and literary associations are brought to 
mind that we become almost bewildered. Concord itself, if for no 
other reason, could rest its fame on its picturesque setting among 
the magnificent elms that have shaded its streets and by-ways long 
before any of the existing houses were erected. 
Tt was here that the First Provincial Congress met to make prep- 
arations for defense and it was to Concord that Paul Revere, Wil- 
liam Dawes and Samuel Prescott rode to warn the inhabitants of 
the approach of the British troops after riding from Cambridge to 
Lexington. The British had placed sentinels to head off the patriot 
messengers, but Prescott escaped and arrived in Concord in time 
to enable the American irregulars to hide their precious stores. 
The first man to meet Prescott on that early morning of April 
19, 1775 was Rev. William Emerson, the grandfather of Ralph 
Waldo Emerson who at that time lived in the ‘Old Manse’ since 
made famous by Hawthorne. At Concord Bridge a large number of 
minute men had assembled upon whom the British fired first but 
were met in reply by a withering fire that caused them eventually 
to fall back on Boston, twenty miles away. The importance of the 
“Concord Fight” was the opportunity it gave the Americans to 
show their determination and their temper. It was here that 
Captain Parker said “Stand your ground. Don’t fire unless fired 
upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it begin here.” 
During practically the whole of the nineteenth century Concord 
might have been called the literary Mecca of America. It was here 
that Ralph Waldo Emerson lived from 1835 until his death in 1882 
in the stately yet simple house shown in the illustration. The 
47
-P-A-G-E-46
expression of character in a work of architecture is after all more 
to be desired than any of the other more academic elements of 
design. The charm of this house lies largely in its suggestion of the 
vigor and simplicity of Emerson’s personality. 
The house does not depend upon architectural ornamentation of 
any kind to give it interest. The designer has depended primarily 
upon a nicely balanced grouping of the windows on the front which 
flank the little Doric porch over the entrance doorway. 
This house is typical of many others in New England where 
simplicity of design and economy of material has been the keynote, 
the effect being attained solely by a careful study of proportions, 
window arrangement and coloring. 
Concord was also the home of Louisa May Alcott, the author 
of “Little Women”, of Thoreau and Nathaniel Hawthorne. It 
was here that Hawthorne wrote his “Tanglewood Tales.” 
No. 9. CLIVEDEN 
Germantown, Philadelphia. 1761 
Cliveden is located in Germantown and is a typical manifesta 
tion of the classic influence upon architecture in Pennsylvania dur- 
ing the period preceding the Revolution. 
While the effect of this building is imposing, it lacks the beauti- 
ful proportions of the Craigie house of the same period. The repe- 
tition of the pediment over the doorway crowning the projecting 
break in the facade is similar to the Craigie design but hardly so 
effective. The pediment doorway however is more distinguished in 
Cliveden. Comparison of the dormer windows in both examples 
shows that the differences in proportion is consistent and harmoni- 
ously related to the building in each case. 
The windows in Cliveden have the panelled shutters in place of 
blinds, and smaller size windows panes. The window lintels have 
a flat arch with sployed rustication which takes the place of the 
single stone so often used. A projecting belt course on thé facade 
accentuates the second floor and the hipped roof is also a charac’ 
teristic feature of Pennsylvania Colonial. The urn-shaped finials 
on the roof suggest the decoration at the angles of the pediment in 
Greek temples. The whole building is in stone work of a rich 
texture and color, which contrasts agreeably with the white shutters 
and entrance. 
48 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
The mansion was built by Samuel Chew when he was Attorney- 
General of Pennsylvania. On October 3, 1777, was fought the 
battle of Germantown. The British barricaded themselves within 
the walls of Cliveden and surprised Washington coming to the aid 
of Wayne. 
The battle has been described as follows by General Wilkinson: 
“The doors and shutters of the lower windows of the mansion 
were shut and fastened, the fire of the enemy being delivered from 
the iron gratins of the cellars and the windows above, and it was 
closely beset on all sides with small-arms and artillery, as is manifest 
from the multiplicity of traces still visible from musket-ball and 
grape-shot on the interior walls and ceilings which appear to have 
entered through the doors and windows in every direction; marks of 
cannorball are also visible, in several places on the exterior of the 
wall and through the roof, though one ball only appears to have 
pentrated below the roof, and that by a window in the passage 
of the second story. The artillery seems to have made no impression 
on the walls of the house, a few slight indentures only being observ- 
able, except from one stroke in the rear, which started the wall.” 
No. 10. FRAUNCES’ TAVERN 
New York City. 1700 
This famous old hostelry which stands at the corner of Broad 
and Pearl Streets was built by Etienne de Lancey about the year 
1700 and was purchased in 1762 by the ardent patriot Samuel 
Fraunces. 
It was made famous as the scene of the public dinner given in 
celebration of the evacuation of New York by the British troops. 
The following despatch from New York, dated November 26, 1783 
appeared in the Pennsylvania Packet of December 2, 1783. 
“Yesterday in the morning the American troops marched from 
Haerlem, to the Bowery lanes. They remained there until about 
one o'clock, when the British troops left the fort in the Bowery, 
and the American troops marched in and took possession of the 
city. After the troops had taken possession, the GENERAL and 
GOVERNOR made their public entry in the following manner:— 
Their excellencies the general and governor with their suites on 
horseback; the lieutenant governor, and the members of the council © 
for the temporary government of the southern district, four a-breast; 
49
-P-A-G-E-48
  
citizens on horseback, eight a-breast; the speaker of the assembly and 
citizens, on foot, eight a-breast. 
“Their excellencies the governor and commander-in-chief were 
escorted by a body of West Chester light-horse, under the command 
of Captain Delavan. The procession proceeded down Queen (now 
Pearl) Street, and through Broadway to Cape’s Tavern. The gov- 
ernor gave a public dinner at Fraunces’ tavern; at which the com- 
mander-in-chief, and other general officers were present.” 
Ten days later Rivington’s New York Gazette recorded the 
historic farewell of Washington to his officers as follows: — 
“Last Thursday noon (December 4) the principal officers of the 
army in town assembled at Fraunces’ tavern to take a final leave of 
their illustrious, gracious and much loved comrade, General Wash- 
ington. The passions of human nature were never more tenderly 
agitated than in this interesting and distressful scene. His excel- 
lency, having filled a glass of wine, thus addressed his brave fellow 
soldiers: 
“With an heart full of love and gratitude I now take leave of 
you; I most devoutly wish that your latter days may be as prosper- 
ous and happy as your former ones have been glorious and honor- 
able.’ 
“These words produced extreme sensibility on both sides; they 
were answered by warm expressions, and fervent wishes, from the 
gentlemen of the army, whose truly pathetic feelings it is not in our 
power to convey to the reader. Soon after this scene was closed, 
his excellency the Governor, the Council and Citizens of first dis- 
tinction waited on the general and in terms most affectionate took 
their leave.” 
The tavern was sold by Fraunces two years after the close of 
the Revolution. Many alterations have been made under the direc- 
tion of the Sons of the Revolution and it will always remain a 
shrine for patriotic Americans. 
No. 11. DYCKMAN HOUSE 
New York City. Circa 1780 
Due to the small size of Manhattan Island and the abnormal 
demand for business and living accommodations, New York City has 
had to grow in the air, rather than spread out superficially. The 
city authorities have had little opportunity to consider sentiment in 
order to preserve its early buildings and historical monuments. 
50 |  
-P-A-G-E-49
  Lovers of the quaint and beautiful should ever be grateful to the 
descendents of the old Dyckman family for having left their original 
homestead with surrounding grounds to the City to be used as a 
public park. 
The Dyckman house is one of the very few houses still standing 
on Manhattan Island that was erected previous to the nineteenth 
century. Although it does not date from the Dutch occupation, and 
it is known to have been erected about 1780, its general character 
is of the type of house which was built in considerable number about 
the middle of the eighteenth century. The builder was a grandson 
of the original Dutch emigrant and the gambrel roof of the type that 
is popularly called “Dutch” was used. The long sweep of the main 
line of the roof ending in a graceful curve which projects over a 
porch both front and rear is one of the most interesting features 
of the house. This treatment was extremely effective in giving 
the general composition a low rambling aspect, tying it closer to 
the ground, and aiding the proportions. 
In addition to its architectural interest, the Dyckman house is 
closely connected with the revolutionary history of New York City. 
Located in the upper portion of the present Broadway, in the region 
of Kingsbridge, it witnessed for over six years the advance and 
retreat of the contending armies. Early in the war the house and 
grounds were occupied by the officers of the Continental Army. 
An actual hut built for sheltering officers has been found on the 
neighboring hillside. American, Hessian, Hanoverian, Highlander, 
Loyalist and British Regular alternately occupied the locality. 
No. 12. WASHINGTON’S HEADQUARTERS 
Newburgh, New York. Built 1750 
In Northern New Jersey and the adjacent vicinity in New 
York State, a type of house was built that was in many respects 
considerably different than those erected in other portions of the 
country. The facility of obtaining a local red sand stone was the 
cause of this. The stone was used both in its rough state and sur- 
faced into irregular ashlar. On account of its color, a very different 
effect was obtained than is seen in the stone houses of Pennsylvania. 
The general structural form of the houses in this section follows 
the lines, first used by the Dutch settlers. The quaint one story 
farm house built by Jonathan Hasbrouck in 1750 is an example of 
Gy
-P-A-G-E-50
er ee od 
this type although it has not the charm of roofline shown in the 
Dyckman house. The Hasbrouck house figured prominently in the 
Revolution as the headquarters of General Washington during the 
closing months of the conflict and we find an interesting account of 
Washington’s occupancy in the “Memoirs” of the Marquis de 
Chastellux, who visited the General there on December 6, 1782. 
“The largest room in it, (which was the proprietor’s parlor for 
his family, and which General Washington has converted into his 
dining-room) is in truth tolerably spacious, but it has seven doors 
and only one window. The chimney, or rather the chimney back, 
is against the wall; so that there is in fact but one vent for the 
smoke, and the fire is in the room itself. I found the company 
assembled in a small room, which served by way of parlor. At nine 
supper was served, and when the hour of bed-time came, I found 
that the chamber, to which the General conducted me, was the very 
parlor I speak of, wherein he had made them place a camp bed. . .” 
It was here that word was received from Sir Guy ai say’ 
ing that the King had agreed to the independence of the thirteen 
Colonies. In 1849 the old house was sold by the family to the State 
of New York and is now open to the public.   No. 13. GUNSTON HALL ON THE POTOMAC 
Virginia. Built 1758 
In 1758, George Mason an intimate friend of George Washing- 
ton erected a mansion only a few miles down the river from Mt. 
Vernon. The two friends were constantly visiting each other, ex- 
changing presents, and discussing the political situation of the day. 
Mason, due to his modest and retiring characteristics never arrived 
at the fame that has been allotted to his friend and intimate, but 
he capably served his country by his foresight and wisdom in a 
less spectacular way. 
He served on the council of the Virginia Convention and pre- 
pared The Bill of Rights which was eventually made a part of the 
Constitution of that State and was the model for similar documents 
in many of the other States of the Union. Patrick Henry, the 
orator, once remarked of George Mason—“He is by far the most 
powerful speaker I ever heard.” 
Gunston Hall is interesting from an architectural view point, 
52
-P-A-G-E-51
because it shows probably the first example of the porch used in 
the South. It is not definitely proved that the beautifully pro- 
portioned Palladian motive used as the central point of interest 
on the main facade, was constructed at the same time, as the house. 
At all events even though it may have been added at a later date, 
it is quite essential as a decorative feature and gives the long low 
appearing structure a feeling of unity that it otherwise would not 
have. 
The charm of Gunston Hall is largely in its restful simplicity 
of line. The color of the brick work which unfortunately cannot 
be shown in the illustration contrasts beautifully with the stone 
quoins at the corners of the building. 
No. 14. THE MORRIS-JUMEL MANSION 
New York City. 1766 
In the year 1765 there appeared in the New York Mercury the 
following advertisement:— 
“A Pleasant situated Farm, on the Road leading to King’s 
Bridge, in the Township of Harlem, on York Island, containing 
about 100 acres, near 30 acres of which is Woodland, a fine piece 
of Meadow Ground, and commands the finest Prospect in the whole 
Country: the Land runs from River to River: there is Fishing, 
Oystering, and Claming at either end...” 
This alluring advertisment was seen by Roger Morris at that 
time living at the corner of Whitehall and Stone Streets. His desire 
for a country home was aroused with the result that he bought 
the land and the following year saw the completion of the fine 
mansion which still looks down from its lofty eminence at Roger 
Morris Park. 
A brief description in the New York Daily Advertiser in 1'792 
gives an idea of the size and arrangement of the interior of the 
Morris house. 
“On the premises is a large dwelling house built in modern style 
and taste and elegance. It has a large hall through the centre; a 
spacious dining room on the right; on the left is a handsome parlor 
and a large back room. On the second floor are seven bedrooms 
and at the top of the house is affixed an electric conductor. Under- 
neath the building are a large, commodious kitchen, pantry, sleeping 
apartments for servants, and a most complete dairy room.” 
53  
-P-A-G-E-52
    
The mansion was occupied by Morris and his family for nine 
years. A public spirited man he gave much of his time to civic 
matters but could not sympathize with the Revolution. So in 1775 
he sailed for England and his large property was cared for by his 
wife who remained in the house for some time but at length removed 
to the house of her sister-in-law at Philipse Manor, Yonkers, taking 
her children with her. 
Anticipating the forced abandonment of New York City to the 
British in September, 1776, General Washington fortified Harlem 
and made the Roger Morris house his headquarters. 
On September 17th we find the following entry in his Orderly 
Book in which he refers to the battle of Harlem Heights:— 
“The General most heartily thanks the troops commanded yes- 
terday by Major Leitch, who advanced upon the enemy, and the 
others who so resolutely supported them. The behavior of yester- 
day was such a contrast to that of some troops the day before (at 
Kip’s Bay) as must show what may be done when Officers and 
Soldiers exert themselves.” 
During the occupancy of the house by General Washington the 
first flag of the revolting colonies was unfurled. The design of this 
early banner of liberty was as follows: 
Where the stars now are was the Union Jack of Great Britain 
with the thirteen red and white stripes we are all so familiar with 
and which the British styled “the Rebellious Stripes.” 
On November 16, 1776, General Washington narrowly escaped 
capture upon leaving this house after viewing the attack of the 
British upon Fort Washington. He had scarcely left the house to 
return to New Jersey when it was taken by fourteen thousand com- 
bined British and Hessian troops. 
At the close of the Revolution the house was confiscated owing 
to the politics of its owner and we find a very interesting entry on 
the subject in General Washington’s diary under the date of July 
10, 1790: | 
“Having formed a Party consisting of the Vice-President, his 
lady, Son & Miss Smith; the Secretaries of State, Treasury & War, 
and the ladies of the two latter; with all the Gentlemen of my 
family, Mrs. Lear @ the two Children we visited the old position of 
Fort Washington, and afterwards dined on a dinner provided by a 
Mr. Mariner at the House lately occupied by Colo. Roger Morris, 
but confiscated and in the occupation of a common Farmer.” 
54 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
The old house remained either as a farmhouse or a tavern until 
1810 when it was purchased by the wealthy French merchant 
Stephen Jumel to gratify the whim of his capricious wife who was 
laying seige to the gates of society. Lavish entertainments were 
given which were the talk of the town but the desired effect was 
not achieved and Mme. Jumel, closing the house, went to France 
where she became a picturesque figure at the Court of Napoleon. 
The Roger Morris or Jumel house is the most interesting piece 
of “Georgian” architecture in New York City. It is the earliest 
example in Colonial architecture of a projecting pediment supported 
by two story columns. These columns are of the Doric order and 
are crowned by a complete classic entablature of the modillion type. 
Here as at Mt. Vernon we notice a tendency toward elongation 
of the order as compared to the proportions of Roman stone archi- 
tecture given by Palladio. This is entirely in accordance with an 
honest development of the art by suiting the design to the material. 
Wood was primarily the material of Colonial designers. 
This structure shows one of the earliest attempts in the North 
to create the “mansion” both actually and in effect. The building 
stands on an eminence overlooking the Harlem River on the road 
to King’s Bridge and in the days before this section of the city was 
crowded with commerce it must have been one of the most magnifi- 
cently situated estates in the county. 
The general appearance of this new style of architecture gives 
the impression of balance and formalism which was a decided change 
from the Dutch style of home architecture which prevailed in 
New York prior to the Georgian period. 
No. 15. WESTOVER 
James City County, Virginia. Circa 1731 
There is no Colonial structure either in the North or South that 
surpasses the beauty of line or proportion that is found in this most 
delightful dwelling. It is a brick building trimmed in stone follow- 
ing closely the best of English traditions. . 
The effect of repose in the facade is heightened by the white 
band separating the first and second stories of the building and the 
white stone base. The location of the huge chimneys at the ends of 
the structure is typical of Southern architecture.

The enormous hipped roof rising from an unbroken cornice is 
an important element in effectiveness. The slates are well graded 
and add interest in texture to what would otherwise be too plain a 
surface. 
The numerous dormers are a satisfactory solution for lighting 
the third story and are sufficiently lost in the color of the roof not 
to interfere with the lines of the well proportioned facades. 
The attention is focused upon the beautiful doorway by its 
contrast with the darker tones of the brick front and the graceful 
broken arched pediment. 
No. 16. MONTICELLO, VIRGINIA 
Circa 1770 
Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson, is a typical example 
of Southern mansion in the classic style. It is distinguished by its 
dignified simplicity, and beautiful proportions and classic entrance. 
Its proportions are similar to Mt. Vernon though it is more classic 
in design representing the prevailing style of a later period. 
A French nobleman, the Marquis de Chastellux has given us 
a graphic description of the mansion of which Mr. Jefferson was 
architect. 
He said it was “Rather elegant, and in the Italian taste, though 
not without fault; it consists of one large square pavillion, the 
entrance of which is by two porticoes, ornamented with pillars. 
The ground floor consists of a very large lofty saloon, which is to 
be decorated entirely in the antique style; above it is a library of the 
same size; two small wings, with only a ground floor and attic story, 
are joined to this pavillion; and communicate with the kitchen, 
offices, etc., which will form a kind of basement story, over which 
runs 2. terrace.” 
After a visit to Monticello in 1796 the Duc de la Rochefou- 
cauld-Liancourt wrote as follows: 
“T found him in the midst of the harvest, from which the 
scorching heat of the sun does not prevent his attendance. . . Every 
article is made on his farm: his negroes are cabinet makers, carpen- 
ters, masons, bricklayers, smiths, etc. "The children he employs 
in a nail factory, which yields already a considerable profit. . . His 
superior mind directs the management of his domestic concerns 
57
-P-A-G-E-56
  
  with the same abilities, activity and regularity which he evinced in 
the conduct of public affairs.” 
The overseer at Monticello, Edward Bacon, has left us a very 
clear picture of the estate during the twenty years he was in Mr. 
Jefferson’s employ: 
“Monticello is quite a high mountain, in the shape of a sugar- 
loaf. A winding road led up to the mansion. On the very top of 
the mountain the forest trees were cut down, and ten acres were 
cleared, and levelled. . . I know every room in that house. Under 
the house and the terrace that surrounded it, were the cisterns, 
icehouse, cellar, kitchen, and rooms for all sorts of purposes. His 
servants’ rooms were on one side. . . There were no negro and other 
out-houses around the mansion, as you generally see on plantations. 
The grounds around the house were beautifully ornamented with 
flowers and shrubbery. Back of the house was a beautiful lawn of 
two or three acres, where his grandchildren used to play. 
“His garden was on the side of the mountain. I had it built 
while he was President. It took a great deal of labor. We had to 
blow out the rock for the walls for the different terraces, and then 
make the soil. . . .I used to send a servant to Washington with a 
great many fine things for his table, and he would send back the 
cart loaded with shrubbery.” 
The Sage of Monticello spent the greater part of his time on his 
estate from his retirement from the presidency until his death in 
1826. 
Upon examination it was found that his fortune had vanished 
owing to the lavish hospitality he dispensed at Monticello so the 
States of Virginia and South Carolina jointly subscribed the sum 
of $20,000 for the maintenance of his daughter in recognition of his 
services to his country. 
No. 17. MOUNT AIRY 
Richmond County, Virginia. 1758 
The famous early home of the Tayloe family was for many years 
after its erection the most magnificent residence in Virginia and 
was so different from any other building of the period that it became 
the talk of the State for many years. Its general aspect closely 
58 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
resembles the English type of smaller country estate, with a strong 
Italian influence of Sir Christopher Wren predominating. 
The plan of the main portion of the group is rectangular with 
a pedimented projecting pavillion both front and rear. Two long 
curved arms forming a passageway lead to subordinate wings. The 
main walls are built in irregularly coursed ashlar with quoins to 
accent and add interest to the corners. The rear pavillion is treated 
with a group of three arches accented by rustication. Each pavil- 
lion is roofed by means of a pediment. 
The most obvious fact in connection with Mount Airy is the 
realization of how closely the American builders studied the English 
prototypes by means of the many books which had found their way 
to this country. Numerous architects and designers during the 
previous decade had issued standard volumes on the new styles of 
the classic revival. Nowhere were such books more needed nor 
more eagerly appreciated than they were in this country at that 
time. 
No. 18. PRINGLE HOUSE 
Charleston, S. C. Circa 1769 
The projecting pediment used as a portico was more typical 
of houses in the Southern States than those of New England. Pos- 
sibly the effect of the sun and climate was partly responsible for 
this. 
Although a two storied order was the more usual type of support, 
toward the end of the eighteenth century the house built by Miles 
Brewton on King Street, Charleston, S. C., shows a superimposed 
Doric order used on the first floor surmounted by an Ionic order 
forming a second story porch. Both orders are in stone. The 
effect of this treatment was one of great dignity. 
The Brewton house also shows the first example in Colonial 
architecture of the elliptical arch used over the main entrance. 
The arch is filled with a leaded glass fanlight. There are however 
no side lights in this instance. The construction of elliptical fan 
lights used with side lights in a Palladian form was of later date. 
Another lovely feature is the hallway running from the front 
door through the entire depth of the house, making almost a monu- 
59  
-P-A-G-E-58
  
  mental effect. Plans of this character seemed to predominate in 
Virginia and South Carolina. 
In 1780 the British captured Charleston. Sir Henry Clinton 
made the house his headquarters and later used it as a fort. Event- 
ually the Americans decided to retake the place, and setting fire to 
the building seemed the simplest way of accomplishing their purpose. 
Knowing the house belonged to Mrs. Motte, the daughter-in-law 
of Miles Brewton, they first consulted her. Her immediate answer 
was “Do not hesitate a moment.” The house was burned and the 
garrison was surrendered to the Continental troops. 
No. 19. MT. VERNON 
Fairfax County, Virginia. 1744-1786 
The house originally built at Mt. Vernon by Laurence Washing- 
ton, the half-brother of our first President, was a very much smaller 
building than that which we know today. George Washington 
inherited the estate of some twenty-five hundred acres overlooking 
the Potomac when he was still a youth of twenty. About 1758 
he commenced to make alterations and additions which were often 
delayed by the long absences he was obliged to make to fulfil his 
military and civic duties. It was not until the year 1786 that the 
final stones were laid on the floor of the portico and even then 
Washington’s permanent occupancy did not occur until three years 
before his death. 
The unique collonnade on the river front is the outstanding 
feature of the composition. It was built after the Revolution and 
at the time when dignity and formalism were being expressed in 
many other dwellings of the Southern gentry by means of two 
storied orders. The impressive row of light square columns how- 
ever is found only at Mt. Vernon. 
At Mt. Vernon we also find a railing used at the eaves of the hip 
roof. The railing serves no useful purpose and is added only to give 
greater height to the front and to add to the mass of the entablature. 
It also helps in softening the line between sky and cornice. The 
building seems to hug the ground more firmly than any other and 
its long low horizontal lines become almost a part of the hilltop land 
scape in which it is situated. 
60
-P-A-G-E-59
In the grouping of the out-buildings the plan somewhat resembles 
Mount Airy. The circular arcaded passageways connecting the 
main house with the service quarters is of Italian origin. 
We obtain a vivid picture of the home life of the Washington 
family from the following description by John Hunter who visited 
Mount Vernon while the above mentioned alterations were in 
progress: 
“The style of his house is very elegant, something like the Prince 
de Conde’s at Chantilly, near Paris, only not quite so large; but 
it’s a pity he did not build a new one at once, as it cost him nearly 
as much as repairing his old one. . . It’s astonishing what a number 
of small houses the General has upon his Estate for his different 
Workmen and Negroes to live in. He has everything within him- 
self—Carpenters, Bricklayers, Brewers, Blacksmiths, Bakers, etc., 
etc., and even has a well assorted store for the use of his family and 
servants.” 
His Excellency lived in a quiet unassuming style in keeping with 
his Republican principles as we find from the following extract 
from an account of a visit to Mount Vernon made by Charles 
Vardo, an Englishman, soon after the close of the Revolution: 
“T crossed the river from Maryland into Virginia, near to the 
renowned General Washington’s where I had the honor to spend 
some time, and was kindly entertained with that worthy family. As 
to the General, if we may judge by the countenance, he is what 
the world says of him, a shrewd, good-natured, plain, humane man, 
about fifty-five years of age, and seems to wear well, being health- 
ful and active, straight, well-made, and about six feet high. He 
keeps a good table, which is always open to those of a genteel 
appearance. . . 
“The General’s house is rather warm, snug, convenient and 
useful, than ornamental. The size is what ought to suit a man 
of about two or three thousand a year in England. ‘The out-offices 
are good and seem to be not long built; and he was making more 
offices at each wing to the front of the house, which added more 
to ornament than to real use. The situation is high, and commands 
a beautiful prospect of the river, which parts Virginia and Mary- 
land, but in other respects the situation seems to be out of the world, 
being chiefly thoroughfare. . . The General’s lady is a hearty, 
61  
-P-A-G-E-60
  comely, discreet, affable woman, some few years older than him- 
self. . . The General’s house is open to poor travellers as well as 
rich, he gives diet and lodging to all that come that way, which in- 
deed cannot be many, without they go out of their way on pur-

No. 20. ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA 
1802-1825 
Arlington in Alexandria County, Virginia, stands facing the 
Capitol at Washington and is generally associated with Robert E. 
Lee whose home it was at the outbreak of the War of Secession. 
It was originally built by George Washington Custis, Washington’s 
adopted son, after the death of the first President when the family 
broke up at Mt. Vernon. 
The portico along the front however was added at a later date 
and is one of the typical examples of the “Greek revival” period 
of American architecture. 
From 1821-1827 the Greeks were fighting their War of Inde- 
pendence and enthusiasm in America rose to the highest pitch in 
favor of the little Christian nation who fought with such bravery 
and success against the Turk. This partisanship was shown not 
only in many forms of art but also in the Greek names given to 
American cities such as Athens, Ypsilanti and many others. 
The diffusion of Greek forms was considerably augmented by 
the publication of numerous volumes reproducing the plans, facades 
and details of the important classic buildings. The portico at Arl 
ington is modelled from the Greek temple at Paestum, a small town 
near Naples, Italy, which was at one time a Greek colony. 
The columns that were used are probably of all classic examples 
the heaviest in their relative dimensions and seem to have a some- 
what disproportionate effect. The same criticism may be made in 
considering their adaptation at Arlington. The rage for Greek 
architecture swept the country from North to South and even to 
the newly settled towns of the middle West where stately mansions 
of this type sprang up next to the settlers’ log cabins. 
Robert E. Lee, whose wife was Mr. Custis’ daughter, was a 
Colonel in the United States Army in 1861 at the time of the 
secession of his State. It was only with the greatest hesitation that 
62
-P-A-G-E-61
he took up arms against the United States Government. He knew 
that the support of the Confederacy would mean ruin to him but 
he felt that it was clearly his duty to support the people of his 
State. He left Arlington, never to return. The estate of eleven 
hundred acres was confiscated during the war but was eventually 
acquired by the Government from General Lee’s son in 1882 and 
became the National Cemetery. It has ever since been a place of 
pilgrimage for the American Nation. 
No. 21. WOODBURY MANSION 
Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Built 1809 
The Southern colonies, from the beginning, developed along 
more luxurious lines than did those of the North. One of the 
evidences of this is shown in the fact that all the finer dwellings 
were in the center of larger estates while in the North, the better 
houses were concentrated in the more crowded sections of the 
cities. 
This condition had an important influence upon the develop- 
ment of the general type of structure that was erected. Where 
space was freely available, as in the South, the buildings were kept 
low and rambling. When enlargements were to be considered 
they were made by means of added wings. In the North however, 
where ground had to be considered, the houses were often built 
in the form of three stories. 
In these circumstances a difficult problem was presented to 
the architect. The house naturally took on a box-like appearance, 
while a pitched roof would have been almost ludicrous, due to its 
height. The pitched roof was therefore eliminated, and in the more 
successful solutions, the exterior proportions were improved by the 
additions of horizontal bands around the four facades. Additional 
interest was also created by varying the sizes of the windows. In 
the Woodbury Mansion the first and second story windows are 
larger than the third story, while balconies help relieve the tendency 
toward monotony. Nearly all of the three story structures were 
crowned with a balustrade which considerably strengthens the 
design.

  Nos. 22, 23, 24—PORCHES 
The porch is an intensely interesting feature of American archi- 
tecture, because it is distinctly an American development and is not 
found in the architecture of any of the European countries. 
The first houses erected in Plymouth Colony and Virginia were 
erected without porches. In many of the most simple farm houses, 
great attention was paid however to the treatment of the front 
doorway. The local carpenters found here their only opportunity 
to exhibit their aesthetic instinct and the result is seen today in 
countless examples showing the most charming and_ original 
detail. The usual motives were the architectural orders in the 
form of wooden pilasters supporting a circular or triangular pedi- 
ment or a flat entablature. (See illustration No. 24). The treat- 
ment given the doorway proper was often associated in composition 
with either the adjoining windows or the second story window 
directly above the door. Great ingenuity was often shown in the 
proportioning of the orders, and adapting them to local conditions. 
Although the classic forms were the inspiration, the exact propor- 
tions of the stone architecture of Vignola and Palladio were altered 
to suit the individual requirements and the use of wood as a struc’ 
tural and decorative material gave the designer a far greater oppor- 
tunity for originality. 
Tt was not until the middle of the eighteenth century that this 
decorative doorway was projected beyond the front of the house 
and an actual covered porch constructed. In designing these 
porches, the same ingenuity was displayed in their structural forms 
as had been displayed before in their decorative elements. In many 
cases, columns were placed in front of pilasters and the pediment 
carried out forming a hood. A semi-circular arch placed over the 
doorway, was one of the methods used for admitting light into the 
entrance hall. Sometimes a narrow window adjoined each side of 
the door and an elliptical arch crowned the three features. The 
doorway of the Phelps House at Andover Hill, Massachusetts is an 
excellent example of this treatment. (See illustration No. 22). 
The sash bars are in lead, ornamented at intersections with lead 
rosettes, the whole forming an agreeable enrichment for the glass 
and helping to relieve the dark transparency. The porch of the 
Phelps house is a rather late example, built about 1820. The 
delicacy of detail, the light wooden appearance of the doric columns 
show the use that the designers made of new materials applied to 
the old classic forms. 
64
-P-A-G-E-63
Another form of porch consisted of a sort of exterior vestibule 
enclosure as illustrated in the Bennett House at Wayland, Massa- 
chusetts. In these cases the ornamental doorway that formerly was 
applied directly to the main wall of the building, was merely brought 
forward, and an enclosure, either with or without windows added. 
This arrangement probably developed for protection from the cold 
winter drafts that chilled the house when the front door was open. 
In a few instances the porch was recessed into the house instead 
of projecting from it. 
No. 25. OLD NORTH CHURCH 
Boston, Mass. 1723 
“Old North” is typical in its general form of a great number 
of the early churches of New England. The spire which dominated 
most of these edifices was a type created by Sir Christopher Wren 
in England. The body is Gothic, the clothes are classic. Sir Chris- 
topher is attributed as having been the designer of many local Amer- 
ican churches. There has never been any documentary proof that 
such was the case and a close comparison of detail will generally 
be sufficient evidence to dispute the statement to the experienced 
observer if not to the layman. There is no doubt however that 
drawings and sketches of the many churches that were erected 
in London after the great fire were brought to this country and 
served as inspiration in local designs. 
Old North Church is undoubtedly one of these, but its pic 
turesque simplicity reflects the strength of character of the early 
worshippers whom the British officers at the time of the Revolution 
considered. “traitors”. 
The steeple is the place where Paul Revere received his signals 
on the night of his famous ride to Lexington and Concord. 
No. 26. ST. PETER’S CHURCH 
Philadelphia, 1761 
The corner stone of St. Peter’s Protestant Episcopal church was 
laid September 21st, 1758 on a site given by Thomas and Richard 
Penn. In 1761 the church was opened though it was not completed 
until March, 1763. 
65
-P-A-G-E-64
  The design of this church was patterned after the churches of 
medieval England. Its rugged tower and exceedingly graceful spire 
are the distinguishing features of this imposing edifice which, except 
for minor changes, remains as it was when George Washington 
worshipped there. 
Bishop De Lancey, in his centennial sermon, preached Septem- 
ber 4th, 1861, said: “We enter by the same doors—we tread the 
same aisles—we kneel where they knelt, we sit where they sat, 
the voice of prayer, instruction, and praise ascends from the same 
desk from which it reached their ears, in the privacy and seclusion 
of the same high straight unostentatious pews.” 
In the crowded churchyard are the graves of many Colonial 
worthies as well as many leaders in the early history of America. 
Stephen Decatur is buried here, and Charles Wilson Peale, who 
painted a famous portrait of Washington. 
During the British occupation of Philadelphia in 1777 the 
pews were burned for fuel. The wooden fence that surrounded 
the property originally was burned also and the brick wall that is 
now in place was built in 1784. 
No. 27. BRUTON PARISH CHURCH 
Williamsburg, Virginia. 1715-1769 
Bruton parish dates from 1658. The present edifice was erected 
in 1715 and the tower in 1769. The building distinctly shows 
in its general form the influence of the Gothic chapels of medieval 
England. The composition is dominated by the tower at the front 
while a gabled transept with a circular window forms a subordinate 
mass. The general design and detail is exceedingly crude as com- 
pared to many of the churches of the same period in the North. 
It also compares unfavorably with many of the neighboring dwell- 
ings of the early planters. The church has however a rugged pic 
turesque quality. 
The Minister, “Mr. Rowland Jones,” was “paid annually ye 
sum of sixteen thousand, six hundred and sixty pounds of tobacco 
and caske.” 
Rev. James Blair, who was minister of Bruton parish at the 
time of the erection of the new building, had been instrumental 
in organizing William and Mary College. 
66
-P-A-G-E-65
  Among the famous names on the resting rolls are those of 
Henry Tyler, great-great-grandfather of President Tyler, George 
Wythe, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, Pat- 
rick Henry and George Washington later worshipped with the 
congregation. 
Today the building is about as it was during the troubled days 
of the war. No change has been made in the exterior, but in 1839 
the interior was changed in many important particulars. In 1905, 
however, it was restored as before. The canopy and curtain which 
had long stood above the pew of Gov. Spotiswood were found and 
again put in position. King Edward VII gave the new pulpit, 
and President Roosevelt provided the lectern. 
No. 28. INDEPENDENCE HALL 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 1730-1750 
The building that is known today as the Cradle of Liberty was 
originally built as the State House of the Province of Pennsylvania. 
With the exception of several town meeting houses and religious 
edifices, built in other Colonies, it is the earliest structure of such 
imposing dimensions built purely for civic purposes. The original 
edifice was commenced in 1730 in the “Centre Square” that had 
been planned by William Penn. Wings were added in 1739 and 
1740 and the tower was completed in 1741 only to be enlarged in 
1750 to hold the bell that was to “Proclaim Liberty throughout all 
the land to all the inhabitants thereof”’—(Levit. XXV:10). 
The design of the building shows a study of the authorities of 
the period but with the customary provincial crudeness in its appli- 
cation, that in its turn creates the quaint characteristics of so many 
of our Colonial buildings. The Palladian arch motif over the main 
entrance door is also repeated in the rear. It is a form that is fre- 
quently found in Colonial architecture and although borrowed from 
England, shows the source of English inspiration. 
The present “Liberty Bell” that is sacred in the ideals of every 
American is the third that was made for the tower and was cast 
in America in 1753. 
From that day the building was the center of the Pennsylvanian 
civic life. After the Second Continental Congress met in the 
Assembly Chamber on May 10, 1775 and took action which led 
to the Declaration of Independence the next year, the State House 
was given the name of “Independence Hall.”

No. 29. THE OLD STATE HOUSE 
Boston, Mass. 1748 
Although the present building known as the Old State House 
was completed in 1748, it was constructed along the lines of an 
earlier structure that was built in 1711 and destroyed by fire. The 
side walls are the only remaining parts of the earlier building. 
The influences in the design are much the same as were those 
that inspired the designers of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, 
although the stepped gable would seem to indicate some of the 
Dutch influence that entered England at the time that William of 
Orange came to the throne. 
The principal interest in this building lies in its historical asso- 
ciation. It was in the center of the Boston “Massacre” of 1770 
and from its balcony was read the Declaration of Independence 
on July 18, 1776 in accordance with the message of John Han- 
cock, President of the Continental Congress, who asked that it be 
proclaimed “in such a mode that the people may be impressed with

No. 30. KITCHEN 
In House in Topsfield, Mass. Built, 1683. 
Many of the early farm houses of New England were composed 
of only two rooms and attic. The entrance hall between the rooms 
adjoined the enormous chimney carrying the flues of the fireplaces 
that opened on each side. The principal room was the kitchen 
which was also used for a living room and dining room. The 
other room was used for sleeping purposes by the entire family. 
In the dwellings of the seventeenth century very little thought 
was given to ornamentation of any kind. Everything was built 
with a useful purpose in view, and in this particular room, the 
only evidence of the enrichment is in the chamfering of the “summer 
beam” (the heavy beam in the middle of the ceiling) where it has 
been planed off at its corners to give it a lighter appearance. The 
ends of the hand-made wrought iron strap-hinges on the doors to the 
closets have also been slightly elaborated. 
The great fireplace in which hang the kettles also shows in its 
back wall the bread oven and one may well imagine the difficulties 
of cooking with these crude implements when one considers all of 
the conveniences with which modern homes are furnished. 
69
-P-A-G-E-68
The furniture in this room shows an old carved chest and a 
great oaken arm-chair that was either brought from England or 
made in this country from an English original. The flat crude type 
of carving in the back and the turnings of the legs and arms are 
distinctly Jacobean. The loose cushion on its seat was one of the 
few comforts that these hardy pioneers permitted themselves. The 
heavy oak cradle hardly resembles our idea of furniture for the same 
use today, but in spite of the fact that it must have been rocked 
from side to side for many children and perhaps for several genera- 
tions, it seems hardly the worse for wear. Possibly the most inter- 
esting thing in the whole room is its wall clock, a most unusual orna- 
ment for such a simple home. 
No. 31. PARLOR OF HART HOUSE 
Ipswich, Massachusetts. Circa 1650 
This room although probably built a few years earlier than the 
one from Topsfield, shows a slightly more advanced stage of decora- 
tive effect and illustrates well the difficulties of judging the contin- 
uity of the style by studying the sequence of detail. 
The “summer beam” in this case has been carefully rounded and 
moulded on its edges instead of having the simple chamfering 
shown in the other example. The vertical pine planks around the 
chimney have been enriched by various mouldings and we find across 
the top of the fireplace opening a double row of small dentils which 
were colored in red and black for additional ornamental effect and 
a similar treatment carried around the “summer beam” where it 
pierces the wall and is continued for a short distance in either direc 
tion. The rest of the wood-work is in its natural color, the knots 
and natural graining giving the textural interest to the surface. 
Three of the walls of the room were plastered. The partition wall 
on the fireplace side was the only one built in wood. 
All of these early rooms had wide plank floors which were 
originally sanded. The lowness of the room was necessary to re- 
tain the heat from the fireplace on cold winter nights as the walls 
were not entirely weather tight. 
The arm-chair in this illustration is an excellent example of the 
crude flat carving that was prevalent on the furniture at this time. 
An interesting butterfly door-hinge is shown at the top of the door 
at the left of the picture and is the only other evidence of ela- 
boration.

No. 32. LIVING ROOM 
In House at Newington, Connecticut. Circa 1735 
This house originally built in what was then the wilderness was 
fortified against attack by Indians, and each night the small group 
of inhabitants of the village were obliged to collect within its walls 
for purposes of mutual protection. It is interesting not only as 
showing a considerable advance in the enrichment of the homes of 
the early founders as compared to those shown in the first illustra 
tion of interior, but also from the fact that it was located in the little 
town of Newington, just outside of Hartford, Conn., where lived 
the first group of Americans who not only claimed that they had the 
right to select their leaders but could also limit the powers of the 
leaders whom they had selected. 
On the wall of the living room we see the transition from the 
simple wooden planks of the previous examples to definitely designed 
wall panelling. In addition we see the introduction of simple but 
graceful fluted pilasters forming a frame for the nicely proportioned 
fireplace. We also notice that the ‘summer beam” and the beams 
at the intersection of walls and ceiling have been either encased or 
panelled and an extra moulding added to form a simple cornice. 
The “cross” stiles in the lower panels are rather unusual as well as 
the curve at the top, and the heavy projecting moulding surround- 
ing the fireplace opening shows that the builder had a sense of com- 
position and proportion. 
One of the interesting features of this room which does not 
show in the picture, is the sliding interior wooden blinds which 
could not only be closed from the inside but also prevented candle 
and lamp light from being seen on the outside. Such a light would 
have been an easy target for the arrows of some marauding redskins. 
The furniture in this room shows a tendency toward less weight 
than the ponderous type used previously. The slat backed chair is 
of unusually interesting detail and of considerable grace of line. 
No. 33. LIVING ROOM 
From Woodbury, Long Island. Circa 1750 
Many of the early houses in and around New York show much 
of the old Dutch influence, reminiscent of the first settlers of New 
Amsterdam and the surrounding villages. 
71 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  The room shown in the illustration indicates an admixture of 
both Dutch and English details. Here we find a much more serious 
attempt at formal architectural motifs in the use of the fluted pil- 
asters. The projecting mouldings of the panels and fireplace trim 
(known as bolection mouldings) which show a considerable step 
in development from the panelling at Newington. There is never- 
theless a naivete in the design that frankly shows the workmanship 
of the country craftsman. The miniature pilasters over the mantel 
standing in the air, so to speak, amply confirm this fact. 
Delft tiles, each with a biblical illustration and text, form the 
facing of the fireplace, and the Dutch Bible on the table shows the 
part that religion played in the lives of the pioneers. 
An interesting built-in china closet is shown. This was an early 
and frequent method of space-saving device and gives an excellent 
opportunity to show the family tableware and keep it from dust 
and breakage when not in use. The treatment is valuable in giving 
color interest to rooms whose walls are usually in a single tone. 
The woodwork in this instance is painted a blue-gray. 
A secret stairway leading from the wall panel in the extreme 
left of the illustration rises to the attic and was probably used for 
smuggled goods. The use of this would seem to be rather inconsis- 
tent with the lessons that must have been learned from the old 
Dutch tiles. 
No. 34. ROOM FROM MARMION 
Prince George County, Virginia. Circa 1730 
“Marmion” was the first home of one of the Fitzhughs of Vir- 
ginia and is an excellent example showing the extent of the elab- 
oration in some of the homes of the South that was seldom 
approached by those in the North of the same date. The designer 
of this room was well versed in the orders of architecture. The 
fluted Ionic pilasters though somewhat crude in detail add a con- 
siderable charm to the whole effect. No pains or expense were 
spared in making this room of a type that would reflect the character 
and standing of the family of the owner. 
Unfortunately the illustration does not bring out the beautiful 
coloring, but at the right-hand side may be seen a painted vase and 
garlands ornamenting the panel in a way very similar to the methods 
of decoration that were being carried out in France at this same 
72

period. The rather elaborate carving of the mirror frame over 
the fireplace seems to have been of later English influence and the 
chairs shown are charming examples of the Chippendale style which 
came into popularity about a half century later. The facing of the 
fireplace is in a richly colored Sienna marble. 
The iron candle stand seems to be little inconsistent with the 
balance of the furnishings, but the Turkish rug carries the richness 
of the walls to the floor and creates a point of interest at the hearth. 
The wing arm chair, in which the lady, dressed in the costume of the 
period, is seated, became popular about this time and was usually 
placed near the fireplace. ‘The wing is supposed to have been origin- 
ally designed to protect the sitter from draughts. 
No. 35. ROOM FROM SAMUEL POWEL’S HOUSE 
Philadelphia, Pa. Built 1768. 
This example.of an interior is one of the most delightful rooms 
of the American Renaissance and shows to what degree of perfec 
tion of detail the American designer eventually approached. The 
exquisite delicacy and proportioning of both the mouldings and 
ornament show the so-called ‘Colonial Georgian” period of art at 
its best. 
Mr. Samuel Powel was a wealthy gentleman, who was Mayor 
of Philadelphia during the stirring days of the writing and signing 
of the Declaration of Independence. He was the friend and con- 
fidant of many of the early founders of the Republic and his house 
was among the most famous in Philadelphia during the Revolution- 
ary period. It was visited at times by John Adams while he was 
awaiting the opening of the first Continental Congress. During the 
English occupation it was the headquarters of the Earl of Carlisle 
who attempted to establish peace, and after the evacuation General 
Washington visited the Powels and transacted his affairs from their 
home. 
The Powel house was also the scene of many brilliant social 
affairs. The family was well travelled, highly cultured and their 
opinion in regard to household furnishing was apparently highly 
regarded. We find an entry in Washington’s diary which showed 
that on one occasion he depended upon Mrs. Powel’s advice in the 
purchase of a chair for Mt. Vernon, which he could use as a pattern 
in the making of others.

In the decoration of this room, the crudeness and picturesque 
quality of the earlier styles have completely disappeared. Ameri- 
can art approaches the formalism of the Christopher Wren period 
of England. The wood panelled wall still covers only one side of 
the room, however, while the other three walls are covered in ori- 
ginal Chinese painted wall paper. 
The consistency of the formalism here shown is also seen in the 
moveable furnishings. The chairs and pie-crust tables are in mahog- 
any and are excellent specimens of the Chippendale influence, show- 
ing the use of cabriole legs with ball and claw feet. The front legs 
of the sofa are of the straight Chippendale form and show a Chinese 
fret ornament used to enrich them. The tall grandfather’s clock 
which is shown in the corner was found in every house that wished 
to make any pretense of wealth and the crystal chandelier hung 
from the high ceiling made a sparkling bit of decoration as it reflected 
the lights from the candles. The upholstery coverings are in im- 
ported damask. 
The furniture as a whole is of the period when the art of the 
cabinet maker was at its best and when the design and finish of 
the native products equalled that of England and harmonized in 
refinement with the architecture and motifs of the mantel, doors 
and panelling. : 
No. 36. DETAIL OF ROOM IN POWEL HOUSE 
Philadelphia. Built 1768 
This interesting view of another portion of the room shown in 
the Powel home, illustration No. 35 gives a better idea of the wall 
paper. This example is an original Chinese hand painted product 
and shows the pagoda motifs in larger detail. 
The mahogany highboy is of the type made in Philadelphia by 
William Savery, probably the greatest of the cabinet makers of the 
early Republic. Savery did for the wealthier class of householders 
in the city of Philadelphia what Duncan Phyfe did for the New 
Yorkers of the same period. Both the design and workmanship 
of the furniture that came from his shop equal if they do not surpass 
the best products of England of that day. The lovely surface 
carving, the vigorous “cabriole” legs and the graceful swan neck 
pediment plainly proclaim him the artist. The bust used as a dec- 
orative feature of the pediment was cast in composition plaster

  which was easily destructible and explains why the majority of 
these ornaments have disappeared. 
The costume of the period of 1780 is made of brocade imported 
from France. 
No. 37. BALLROOM FROM GADSBY’S TAVERN 
Alexandria, Virginia. 1793 
_ Alexandria was a small town on the main line of coach travel 
between Richmond and Philadelphia. Travellers invariably stopped 
there to pass the night. It lay only eight miles from Washington’s 
house at Mount Vernon. 
When Gadsby’s Tavern was built, Philadelphia was the Capitol 
and Richmond the most important city in one of our wealthiest 
States. The route between the two cities was constantly traversed 
by many of the most important citizens of the early Republic. 
John Gadsby who owned the Inn was also part owner in the 
company that operated the stage line. Naturally he arranged to 
have the travellers arrive at his front door and the house became an 
important meeting place as well as a center of social life in the neigh- 
borhood. Being so near to Mount Vernon, the former President 
and his wife were often invited to the functions which were con- 
stantly held. After Washington’s retirement from active political 
life, an annual practise was made to give a ball on his birthday which 
both he and his wife always attended. A letter from Washington 
to the managers of the ball has been preserved and shows his interest 
in the lighter things of life right up to within a few days of his 
death: 
Mt. Vernon, 12 Nov., 1799. 
Gentlemen: 
Mrs. Washington and I have been honored with your polite invitation to the 
assemblies in Alexandria this winter, thank you for this mark of your attention. But 
alas! our dancing days are no more. We wish, however, all those who relish so agree- 
able and innocent an amusement all the pleasure the season will afford them. 
Your most obedient and obliged humble servant, 
Go. Washington. 
The room illustrated in this picture is the actual ball room in 
which George and Martha Washington danced. It is over sixty 
feet long and has two fireplaces. The musicians’ gallery is shown 
at the right. The architectural woodwork of the doorways; man- 
77
-P-A-G-E-76
  tels, wainscot and cornice is delicately designed, of the classic detail 
and beautifully proportioned. The coloring of the wood itself is 
a grayish blue which was the original color used in Washington’s 
time. 
The furniture now shown in the room is of the Chippendale 
type although the chairs shown along the wall at the right are what 
were locally known as bandy-legged fiddle backs, or more precisely 
the pre-Chippendale type of splat-back with cabriole legs. 
The Tavern was also the scene of a brilliant entertainment given 
in honor of General Lafayette when he returned for his triumphal 
visit to this country in 1824. 
No. 38. ROOM FROM HAVERHILL, MASSACHUSETTS 
1790 
The bedroom taken from the home in Haverhill shows that 
the same quality of fineness and perfection of architectural detail 
is illustrated both in Mr. Powel’s house in Philadelphia and in the 
ball room from Gadsby Tavern. It is of the best period of well 
studied native American design inspired by the English prototypes 
that in themselves had come from an intelligent research of Italian 
classic forms. 
The furnishings, fabrics and wall treatment of this room are 
even more interesting than the architecture. The wall paper was 
imported from France and is of the type and pattern that was 
being produced during the latter portion of the reign of Louis XVI. 
The fabric covering the wing chair is an original toile de Jouy and 
is shown in detail in illustration No. 38. A corner of the four-post 
bed shows a portion of the graceful fluted post supporting a cornice 
from which hangs a valance of the same toile. 
The mahogany chest-on-chest has a lower portion that shows a 
strong Chippendale influence while the upper portion with its 
simple free standing columns supporting a cornice shows the tend- 
ency toward severity that ushered in the “Empire” style. The 
figures on the pediment are attributed to Samuel Mclntire, the 
architect of Salem, Massachusetts. 
The chair standing against the wall is of the Sheraton type.

No. 39. AMERICAN EMPIRE PERIOD 
1800-1810 
The Empire period in America was one of extremes in matter 
of taste and design. In retrospect a definite tendency in change of 
form may be easily seen, but at the time a variety of influences pro- 
duced a certain confusion in the minds of the people which was 
of course reflected in the products of the manufacturers. 
The illustration shows a grouping of “Empire” products. The 
pictorial wall paper is French in origin and represents a typical 
hunting scene in rather brilliant coloring. The red coats of the 
huntsmen stand out strongly in contrast with the green foliage. 
The drawing of the figures is unusually well done. The mahogany 
sofa was made by Duncan Phyfe in his best period, the arms being 
enriched by the graceful lyre motive. The feet designed in what is 
sometimes called the cornucopia pattern, are less successful as they 
lack a structural quality in appearance. The costume shown is 
taken directly from the French Empire period and is very similar 
to the costume worn by Mme. Recamier in her famous portrait by 
David. 
No. 40. FIREPLACE IN COTTAGE 
At Cape Cod, Massachusetts 
The fireplace, in the days before the introduction of stoves and 
central heating plants, was a much more important part of the 
house than it is today. It was used not only for heating purposes 
but for all the cooking as well. The hearth was the natural 
gathering place for the family on cold winter nights, who grouped 
themselves around it, often toasting on one side while the other 
side remained chilly. 
With the comparatively primitive conveniences of colonial 
households we find that a whole series of various mechanical con- 
trivances and other useful implements were developed in connec 
tion with the hearth and fireplace. 
In the illustration, taken from an old fireplace in Cape Cod, 
Massachusetts, a grouping of some of these old fashioned metal 
objects is shown. The iron crane that swung backwards and 
forwards supporting the iron skillet or kettle was of the most com- 
79
-P-A-G-E-78
mon of these objects. A spit or grid for roasting was usually 
placed in the kitchen fireplace, and may be seen in illustration No. 
43 showing the kitchen of the Wayside Inn. Various methods 
were used to turn the spits. Some were turned by hand, others 
by dog treadle, and others by stones or lead weights. 
Hanging at the right side of the mantel in the illustration may 
be seen the brass warming pan in which red hot charcoal was 
placed. This was used to take the chill off the beds before re- 
tiring for the night. The bellows was of course necessary for 
every fireplace. Andirons or fire dogs take an unlimited number 
of forms in Colonial art. The early ones were in iron, sometimes 
painted. The later ones are often in turned brass. The powder 
horn shown on the left of the mantel was part of the essential 
equipment of every household. Tongs, trivets, square grids for 
broiling, pot hooks, and bread-peels were among the other neces- 
sary and useful articles of the hearth. 
No. 41. HALLWAY, WAYSIDE INN 
Sudbury, Massachusetts 
This spacious hallway with its beautiful staircase gives an 
atmosphere of hospitality and taste that must have been possessed 
by the people who were the original owners of the Wayside Inn. 
While no doubt the wall paper is not the original, it is typical 
of the treatment in houses of this period. The staircase with wide 
treads and beautifully designed bannisters and newel post painted 
white with the mahogany hand rail is also true to the style of the 
times. 
No. 42. THE TAP ROOM, WAYSIDE INN 
Sudbury, Massachusetts 
The tap-room was the gathering place for the minute men and 
the other ardent patriots who discussed impending events and 
pledged themselves with raised pewter mugs, to resist the taxation 
without representation and support the Continental Congress. 
What exciting tales must have been told in the Inn tap-room fol- 
lowing the disasterous retreat of the British troops from Lexington 
and Concord. 
80
-P-A-G-E-79
  The timbered ceiling and the open fireplace contribute an 
atmosphere of hospitality and informality quite in keeping with the 
purpose of this room. The burned wood table and Windsor 
chair correspond with the early period which the interior repre- 
sents. 
No. 43. THE KITCHEN, WAYSIDE INN 
Sudbury, Massachusetts 
The Wayside kitchen is a good example of the period of 
gambrel roof houses of the more pretentious type prevalent during 
the Queen Anne period. It presents the same homelike atmos- 
phere as the tap-room and its furnishings indicate that the inmates 
were not averse to partaking of a meal in this cosy room. The 
solidity of the beam construction explains the durability of these 
pre-Revolutionary buildings as well as reflects the simple sturdy 
character of the people who inhabited them. 
The chest on the left developed from the chests of an earlier 
period; the rush bottom chair nearby is of a design similar to the 
Jacobean style; the turned table no doubt was a family heirloom; 
the dresser at the rear contains the pewter ware arranged in an 
orderly manner. 
No. 44. THE PARLOR, WAYSIDE INN 
Sudbury, Massachusetts 
The parlor has received a treatment similar to that of the 
entrance hall and is in keeping with the Queen Anne style. It is 
quite characteristic of homes that they were refurnished to con 
form to the different styles in vogue, so that we find Jacobean 
furniture keeping company with Queen Anne. 
The panelled woodwork of the fireplace and doors is painted 
white. This treatment of walls which formed a rich contrast with 
the wall paper preceded the richly carved woodwork of the Geor- 
gian period. H. L. hinges are used on the doors. The ever popu- 
lar gatelegged table makes a good combination with the Queen 
Anne chairs. The richly ornamented rug serves to give the nec 
essary decorative touch to this most attractive room. 
81 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  No. 45. THE BED ROOM, WAYSIDE INN 
Sudbury, Massachusetts 
Colonial bedrooms of this period were not less attractive than 
other rooms in the house. They were low studded and of gener- 
ous proportions. Fireplaces were considered a necessity though 
they were not used in earlier periods when it was necessary to 
warm the beds with warming pans. The Wayside bedroom con- 
tains a beautiful panelled wood fireplace with a mantel. The wall 
paper design is unobtrusive and suitable for such a room. The 
floor is made up of wide planks upon which are arranged the rugs. 
The bed is the French roll variety sometimes called the “Sleigh” 
bed, which was popular during the Empire period when objects of 
furniture were of massive proportions. This piece must have been 
added sometime during the early part of the nineteenth century. 
The chair on the left is a rush bottomed ladder back arm chair 
of an early period. 
No. 46. THE LAFAYETTE COACH, WAYSIDE INN 
Sudbury, Massachusetts 
This historic coach is now preserved for future generations of 
Americans at the Wayside Inn, Sudbury, Massachusetts. In it 
Daniel Webster and Lafayette rode to the unveiling of Bunker 
Hill monument in 1825. It is an excellent example of early coach 
design. 
In Colonial days every man of substance kept his coach in 
which to travel and visit his friends. They were huge lumbering 
vehicles with the body suspended on thick leather straps to lessen 
the jolting caused by poor roads. A flight of four steps, which 
folded up when not in use, gave access to the interior. The coach- 
man’s high seat had no protection from the weather. Behind was 
a platform on which pigskin and deerskin trunks were carried on 
long journeys. Ross in New York and the firm of Lucas and Pad- 
dock in Boston made very beautiful coaches. 
As private coaches were confined to the well-to-do the general 
public traveled by stagecoach. One traveler named Weld, in 
1795, tells the following amusing anecdote: “The driver frequently 
had to call to the passengers in the stage to lean out of the car- 
riage first on one side then on the other, to prevent it from over- 
82 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
setting in the deep ruts, with which the road abounds. ‘Now 
gentlemen, to the right,’ upon which the passengers all stretched 
their bodies half-way out of the carriage to balance on that side. 
‘Now, gentlemen, to the left,’ and so on.” 
Toward the close of the eighteenth century President Quincy 
of Harvard made a trip by stagecoach between Boston and New 
York and has given us a very vivid account of the journey:—‘The 
carriages were old and the shackling and much of the harness made 
of ropes. One pair of horses carried us eighteen miles. We gen- 
erally reached our resting place for the night if no accident inter- 
vened, at ten o'clock, and after a frugal supper went to bed, with 
a notice that we should be called at three next morning, which 
generally proved to be half-past two, and then whether it snowed 
or rained, the traveller must rise and make ready, by the help of 
a horn-lantern and a farthing candle, and proceed on his way 
over bad roads, sometimes getting out to help the coachman, lift 
the coach out of a quagmire or rut, and arrived in New York after 
a week’s hard travelling, wondering at the ease as well as the 
expedition with which our journey was effected.” 
No. 47. GARDEN OF WAYSIDE INN 
Sudbury, Massachusetts 
Colonial Gardens as a rule show a consistency in their general 
design that makes them the perfect setting for an informal type of 
dwelling. It was only in rare examples, belonging to the largest 
estates that a serious attempt at formalism was made. In this re 
spect the art of the early landscape designer in this country follows 
much more closely the English prototype than that for which either 
France or Italy is best known. 
The garden at the Wayside Inn at Sudbury, Massachusetts is 
taken as containing most of the elements of colonial domestic 
garden arrangement although it is perhaps larger than the average. 
It successfully carries out the purpose of garden design in harmon- 
izing the house with its surroundings and accentuating the points 
of interest in the structure. Usually a main central path leads 
to an axis of the house and is flanked by subordinate paths that are 
laid out in rambling curves following the contour of the ground. 
Planting appears to show a generous promiscuity but is in reality 
much more carefully studied than would seem at first glance. 
83  
-P-A-G-E-82
The garden is not a separate unit in itself. A distinct rela 
tionship with the house occurs both in its general plan and in the 
detail and character of the planting. Where natural vistas occur 
as they do in the case of the Wayside Inn, where the distant hills 
and broad meadows may be seen, full advantage is taken. 
One of the glories of the New England towns and villages are 
the magnificent trees that were planted by the colonists to create 
an atmosphere similar to the towns they had left in England. For 
these trees alone, an eternal gratitude is due our ancestors. 
No. 48. SLAT-BACK OR LADDER-BACK CHAIRS 
1700-1725 
The general history of chairs is very engrossing and the evolu- 
tion of this highly necessary piece of furniture is most significant. 
During the Middle Ages, the chair was an emblem of power and 
its occupant a person of highest rank. To the throne can rightly 
be ascribed its ancestry. 
When our forefathers first established themselves on our shores, 
chairs as we understand them today were scarce, stools and benches 
being generally used. The stools were massive in their construc’ 
tion, with splayed legs and heavy stretchers; occasionally carving 
was attempted on the skirting. Cushions and bright fabrics were 
ofttimes used on these stools and helped to liven interiors which 
were as a rule sombre. 
Long benches were called “forms” and were designed along 
the same lines as the stools. 
Settles were used in the middle of the eighteenth century and 
their picturesqueness has always been associated with the fireside, 
where this piece of furniture was customarily placed. They were 
constructed with solid backs to keep away draughts. The backs 
were often panelled but seldom carved. 
The wainscot chair (see Plate 49) with its severity and throne- 
like massiveness was followed by a great number of lighter pieces 
which are today known as Brewster, Carver, slat back, bannister- 
back and Windsor chairs. 
The chair at the left of Plate No. 48 shows a maple slat back 
(or ladder back) chair with elaborately turned back posts, remini- 
scent of the Brewster or Carver chair. The two large chairs are 
84
-P-A-G-E-83
shown with the characteristic mushroom-shaped knobs on the arm 
posts, the one on the right showing a more delicate form in the 
turning of legs and back posts. The small chair was presumably 
made for a child. The three pieces have gracefully turned finials 
(summit of the back posts). There are a great many varieties of 
slat back chairs having from two to five slats, with an infinite vari- 
ety of turnings for legs and back posts. The slats also are often 
differently conceived. 
This type of chair runs well into succeeding periods, and in 
provincial districts, has been continued almost to our day. Nearly 
all of these chairs have rush seats on which cushions were used. 
No. 49. WAINSCOT CHAIR 
17th Century 
The wainscot chair is an isolated type that is directly descended 
from the Gothic chairs of the Middle Ages. Made in oak, it is 
heavy and strong, and follows the rectangular stile and rail con- 
struction of the earlier periods. 
Many were brought over from Jacobean England and repro 
duced by the less experienced craftsmen in America. 
The turned baluster legs show the introduction of the Renais- 
sance motifs of Italy that filtered through France into the Court 
of Henry VIII. The heavy stretchers harmonize admirably with 
the general scale. 
Many of these chairs are elaborately decorated with the flat 
low relief carving of Elizabethan times. The cresting at the top of 
the back is shaped and often enriched by a sunflower motif. 
The use of these chairs was discontinued after the beginning 
of the eighteenth century. 
No. 50. CHEST, CHAIR TABLE, CRADLE AND 
CARVER CHAIR 
17th Century 
The chest was probably the principle article of furniture in 
early colonial homes. It was used for many purposes and especi- 
ally for the storing of clothing. The early colonists especially those 
living back from the Atlantic sea-board, were, of necessity, always 
85  
-P-A-G-E-84
on the alert for possible attacks by hostile Indian tribes and in a 
hurried abandon of their homes, the chest was pressed into use to 
carry the most valuable belongings, where other pieces of furniture 
could not have been moved. 
A considerable number of chests were brought over from Eng- 
land and served as the models for those made here. They are of 
the simplest rectangular construction, vertical stiles and horizontal 
rails forming varied panelling. Most of the chests which show so 
markedly their Gothic tradition were carved, although at times, 
crudely. Pieces of wood carved in heavy relief were applied to the 
more elaborate ones in a symmetrical and orderly manner. 
Chair table tops were more often round than oblong or square. 
These pieces were greatly used by our forefathers in their habit- 
ually small rooms, economy of space being a necessity with them. 
Chair tables when not in use, were placed along the wall. This 
particular example with a large oblong top in an unusual and very 
interesting piece. It has elaborate turnings, substantial and well 
balanced framework and ornately scrolled cleats. 
The cradle has long since been abandoned by the modern 
mother. Conditions were different with the early American 
settlers however. The housewife attended her child while sewing 
and busying herself with daily chores. During intervals of work, 
her foot was applied to the rocker to quiet the young babe. The 
piece before us is of substanial construction and rather crude 
workmanship. The lines nevertheless form an agreeable composi- 
tion. The sides are panelled and a pleasant decorative motif has 
been added with the turned finials at head and foot. 
Carver and Brewster chairs succeeded the more massive pan- 
elled wainscot type. Their main characteristic is their composi- 
tional structure of turned vertical and horizontal spindles. In arm 
chairs such as this one, the straight front and back posts are con- 
nected with horizontal arms at right angles. Here the back posts 
are crowned with elaborately turned finials known as mushroom 
knobs. The three slats show equally careful and ornate turnings. 
The seat is rush. A great variety of these chairs have been pre- 
served and are among the most interesting of our early American 
pieces.

  No. 51. BANISTER BACK AND SPLAT BACK CHAIRS 
1700-1750 
Open backed chairs with vertical supports gave our early 
craftsmen greater freedom of expression than possible with the 
horizontal slats of the ladder-back type leading to the construction 
of chairs with delicate and, at times, elaborate members. 
The banister back chairs were first to appear and were in use 
in many varied forms at the close of the seventeenth century. Splat 
back or fiddle back chairs (Nos. 1, 2 and 4) are associated with 
the second quarter of the eighteenth century. 
With the banister back chair foreign influences were felt, 
both Continental and Oriental. These influences were first to be 
observed in England and were in consequence transmitted to our 
shores. With the introduction of these new elements in design 
came a change in the general aspect of furniture and architecture. 
A new sophistication followed by a decidely marked refinement in 
scale and craftmanship. This change coming at the close of the 
seventeenth century was the first step towards the greater refine- 
ment of the century to follow. 
Chairs were perhaps most affected by new criterions of taste. 
Rectangular joinery in construction was maintained and turning 
and carving remained the principal method of decoration. In this 
new era in furniture forms, the banister back chair is probably the 
most American manifestation. Here the chair back is filled with 
split turned banisters, similar to those associated with stairways. 
The flat side is usually turned towards the front. Full turned 
banisters were occasionally used, however. 
Splat back chair forms were even more numerous than in the 
case of banister backs. Here the cabinet maker allowed himself 
great freedom of line and succeeded in creating panels of marked 
beauty. In the chair at the left may be observed the introduction 
of a new and graceful element, namely, the Spanish foot as a termi 
nation of chair legs, which once more shows the foreign influence. 
The seats of these banister and splat back chairs were covered 
in many ways. Some pieces had rush seats and a good many were 
cushioned and covered with various imported textiles—damask, 
velvet, leathers, and also with “Turkey-work”, an imitation of the 
Oriental rug pile, made by the Colonial housewife.

EARLY AMERICAN PRESS CUPBOARD 
Circa 1650
-P-A-G-E-87
No. 52. CHEST OF DRAWERS 
From the simple chest began a development which led into a 
great number of variations in succeeding periods. With the addi- 
tion of a drawer below the chest proper, the piece took on a 
greater usefulness. The hinged lid disappeared and eventually two 
or more drawers were added, raising the height and forming the 
complete chest of drawers. These pieces did not vary much from 
the chests proper in general character of design. They were either 
elaborately carved or of austere simplicity with slight mouldings to 
bind the edges depending upon the skill and ability of the local 
cabinet maker. 
The later variation was known as the chest-on-chest and as the 
name implies was merely one chest of drawers placed on top of 
another one. Often the upper chest was slightly smaller than the 
lower one. 
No. 53. EARLY AMERICAN PRESS CUPBOARD 
Circa 1650 
There were three types of cupboards in use in the American 
colonies during the seventeenth century:—‘livery,” and “press,” 
names derived from similar English pieces. ‘The press or Court 
cupboard was undoubtedly the most imposing and the most charac 
teristic article of furniture of Tudor England. For the most part 
made of oak, they were essentially massive in contour. Refinement 
of line and form was apparently not a consideration and the elab- 
orate carving and molding found on these pieces suggest, as a rule, 
crudeness rather than delicacy. Although they are far from lack- 
ing in beauty. A very interesting diversity of carved decoration, 
moldings and turned posts appear on these pieces. 
The illustration shows an American press cupboard. The date 
is about 1650. Here the carving is very rich. The two support- 
ing posts of the upper portion have been obviously left plain to 
contrast with the background. The cupboard is divided into two 
horizontal parts, the upper part slightly receding. Another charac- 
teristic form has the upper section splayed on either side. Inside 
is space for shelves. Other examples had spacious drawers. The 
outer shelf was used for displaying silver, pewter or pottery. 
Cupboards were used for storing food and household articles.

  No. 54. SPLAT BACK ARM CHAIR 
1710-1720 
Along with the greater refinement of design, more attention 
was paid to the finish and quality of material in various articles of 
furniture. Detail was increased and new materials were intro- 
duced. Walnut, burl, butternut and other woods whose grain 
and figure are decorative elements in themselves, were used for 
enrichment. 
In provincial districts, however, older and simpler modes con- 
tinued. The illustration shows a maple splat-back arm chair, and 
is an excellent example of pleasant dignity and well balanced pro 
portion. Great attention has been given in this piece to the turn 
ings of legs and rail, especially in the latter do we find a well 
organized sense of design and balance. The chair back sometimes 
called a fiddle back is of almost classic beauty and the severity 
is gracefully relieved by an indented cresting. The slightly curved 
arms are gracefully placed and artfully connect the ornate front 
with the simpler back. 
The photograph in itself will succeed in giving some idea of 
how perfectly the different members of this piece were joined and 
with what care and skill the cabinet makers of old worked. In the 
early eighteenth century, time was not at a premium as it is today 
and tasks, no matter how humble, received the sincerest attention, 
the most valued reward oftentimes being the satisfaction of know- 
ing that the job was well done. 
No. 55. DESK BOX ON FRAME AND TABLE 
1650-1700 
With the increased ease in living, the Colonists developed more 
pretentious furniture. The desk box was an elaboration of the 
chest, with a hinged top and mounted on a support with turned 
legs and stretchers. Finely cut mouldings and occasional carving 
or split turnings gave to these pieces a dignity and sobriety which 
befitted their owners. 
The desk box was the holder of the family Bible and the few 
books that were considered as precious belongings. These were 
usually limited to theological writings and the almanac. The abil- 
ity to read was rather limited among the people of the middle 
class, both in Europe and America at this date. 
90  
-P-A-G-E-89
  
Tables were of varied forms. The earliest types were planks 
supported on trestles, but more sophisticated forms were also used. 
The tops were both rectangular and circular or elliptical and pro 
jected far over the apron. 
No. 56. GATE LEG TABLES 
1675-1700 
The gate leg table also finds a beginning with this early furniture 
although its general use dates late in the period. The term “gate- 
leg” is derived from the construction of the piece, having on either 
side an additional pivot leg or “gate” which when folded permits 
the leaves to drop, forming a long and narrow table. Elliptical and 
rectangular leaves are the most usual. Their origin is decidedly 
English, comparatively few tables of this sort being found in other 
parts of Europe at this time. 
No. 57. CHAIR TABLE 
1700 
Necessity being the mother of invention, our forefathers con- 
tinued to combine table and chair, economy of space ofttimes being 
a necessity. It must be remembered that the Colonists were still 
dwelling in small abodes and that the houses of more sumptuous 
proportions did not generally make their appearance until the middle 
of the eighteenth century. Our Eastern States were still in the pro- 
cess of colonization—New Jersey, New York, Maryland and Penn- 
sylvania had only recently been annexed to the crown of England 
by George II. 
The Colonists were inclined to repeat in their furniture the 
models brought from England but circumstances altered conditions 
as demonstrated by the chair table we are concerned with here. 
Craftsmen of the New World created a piece of furniture which 
can be labelled as distinctly their own. Here the heavy chair 
related to the wainscot chair is fitted with a tall back, pivoted at the 
point where the arms join the back-posts. The back could thus be 
swung forward and down and, resting on the arms, form the top of a 
table which might be any of the usual table shapes. 
91
-P-A-G-E-90
  No. 58. BUTTERFLY TABLE 
Circa 1725 
A variation of the gateleg table is the so called butterfly table 
in which instead of a “gate” a flap, pivoted vertically, supports 
the drop-leaf in place. The usual curved shape of this flap gives 
the name to this type. In this particular piece the delicately turned 
legs are splayed as was often the custom, making the piece more 
sturdy. The heavy and simple rail on which the supporting flaps 
pivot admirably balances with the table top. 
It is of interest to note here, the various woods which were 
employed in the making of these tables, chests and chairs. Furniture 
was necessarily constructed from the trees which were most common 
to the forests of the east. The preponderant wood of this period is 
oak, but it was combined frequently with pine and other soft woods 
when too great use was not required. Oak, ash, hickory, chestnut, 
maple, whitewood and red cedar trees were felled in almost virgin 
forests, transported by ox carts through untrampled country to rural 
and urban communities where cabinet makers exercised a lucrative 
trade, and where they naturally flourished in the areas where the 
greatest wealth was accumulated. The art of these cabinet makers 
was not only one of skill but at times of great artistry. Being of 
simple tastes our forefathers created objects of extreme sincerity and 
purity of expression and have left to us an art of almost classic 
beauty. 
No. 59. WINDSOR CHAIRS 
1750-1825 
There is a popular legend to the effect that George II of England 
while hunting near his castle at Windsor was caught in a violent 
downfall of rain and found shelter in a shepherd’s hut. Here he 
found a chair such as he had never laid eyes on before. It had 
been made by the shepherd with his pocket knife. The king liked 
this home-made piece so much that he had it copied immediately. 
The shepherd’s was the first Windsor chair. 
This well known chair, which at one time or another had found 
its way into the home of almost every English speaking person, is 
undoubtedly the most simple, graceful and practical piece of furni- 
ture of the eighteenth century. Indeed, it is hard to find an ugly 
92
-P-A-G-E-91
Windsor. It is comfortable to sit in, which cannot be said of most 
other ‘chairs of the distant past, and its construction insures an 
unusual combination of lightness and strength. 
The Windsor chair, though first introduced in England, can 
more properly be called American as it is in this country between 
1750 and 1825 that most of these chairs were designed and that 
the greatest variety of types came into being. For almost one hun- 
dred years this simple chair enjoyed a widespread popularity in 
England and America, for it was inexpensive and comfortable and 
of graceful line. In tavern, farmhouse and cottage it could be seen. 
Windsor chairs were never made of the more elaborate cabi- 
net woods. The hoop of the back was constructed of hickory, 
spindles of the back, of ash or hickory, legs of oak, hickory or 
maple, seats of pine, whitewood or beech. These chairs were often 
painted. Green was the most popular color at first, but black, 
yellow and even red Windsors are to be found today. Occasionally 
they were painted with faint lines of contrasting color but more 
often they were left plain. Unconsciously true to its humble 
origin, little decoration was ever used to adorn its slender frame. 
The different types of American Windsor chairs are as fol- 
lows: the hoop-back side and arm chairs, the fan-backs, the comb- 
backs and the low-backs. 
The chair at the left of the illustration shows a hoop-back arm 
chair with comb-back extension (used as a head rest) supported 
by two back braces and bamboo turning. The center figure shows 
a late and somewhat awkward development of the comb-back rock- 
ing chair, the back with thick splats of a rather heavy design. It is 
interesting to note here that the rocking chair originated in America 
and, curious as it may seem, this comfortable piece of furniture has 
never met with popular approval elsewhere. The figure at the 
right shows a child’s comb-back arm chair of graceful back, with 
legs slightly at variance with the back spindles and arm supports. 
No. 60. FAN-BACK SIDE CHAIR. (Windsor) 
Eighteenth Century 
Much can be said of interest regarding the actual construction 
of the Windsor chair. They were undoubtedly designed for grace 
as well as for comfort. The saddle seats, as they are called, were 
cut out of a single piece of plank varying somewhat in outline and 
93
-P-A-G-E-92
hollowed out in the fashion of a saddle. The rakish placing of 
the legs was a matter of strength as well as design. Driven clear 
through the seats with ends placed so as to assure stability and 
at a considerable distance from the corners, the splay of the legs 
extends considerably beyond the line of the seat. 
The underbracing consists almost invariably of three bulb turned 
pieces, two connecting the front with the back legs, the third join- 
ing these. The chair backs are slanted backwards and the spindles, 
tapering and slightly bulged on the best examples, straight and 
cylindrical on the poorer ones, were driven into holes in the seat 
and fitted into others in the hoop or comb. The result of all this 
wedging as it may easily be seen assured a rigidity of construction 
that has defied the weight of over a century of hard usage. 
Although no illustration is shown, the writing Windsor chair 
is such an unusual piece that it should not go without mention. On 
the right arm an extension or writing tablet part is an extension 
of the arm proper, supported by an extra turning in uniformity with 
the two existing arm supports of the chair. Under the seat a small 
compartment or drawer was devised for keeping writing materials. 
It is said that Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independ- 
ence in such a chair. Washington was in the habit of using one 
also. Ralph Waldo Emerson and Nathaniel Hawthorne both 
owned Windsor chairs of various types and acknowledged them as 
most practical. 
No. 61. HIGHBOY WITH FLEMISH PANELLING 
1675-1700 
The highboy or high chest as this piece of furniture was origin- 
ally called is the result of an interesting evolution which began with 
the simple floor chest, developing later into a chest with one drawer, 
to become finally a chest raised on a framework supporting any- 
where from three to six drawers. We should not confuse the 
highboy with the chest of drawers. Though similar in purpose 
and design, these pieces are without the elevated framework of the 
highboy, consisting of from four to six legs secured to a flat rim 
stretcher. Highboy is evidently a corruption of the French “Haut- 
Bois” meaning high wood. Lowboy is used in contrast for a low 
chest of drawers. 
94
-P-A-G-E-93
  The oak highboy here illustrated was built between 1675 and 
1700 and is an English piece of Dutch influence. 
The chest section proper preserves in its rugged and massive 
construction much the same feeling as already observed in the wains- 
cot chair and other furniture of Gothic heritage. Its beautifully 
proportioned and almost fragile underbracing indicates nevertheless 
a strong desire on the part of the William and Mary cabinet makers 
to create pieces of graceful form and delicate beauty—introducing 
a new refining influence in furniture construction. 
On the lower part of this piece, the legs show graceful cupped 
bell turnings and the delicately cut out rail and apron on the drawers 
may be observed the characteristic pear-shaped pull handles, one 
of the many interesting examples of early eighteenth century Eng- 
lish hardware. Many copies of such highboys were made on this 
side of the Atlantic. 
No. 62. HIGHBOY 
1710-1720 
The refining influences at work at the beginning of the eigh- 
teenth century are easily discernable in this highboy of the type 
that was being produced in England under William and Mary. 
The Gothic rectangular joinery that persisted through the Jacob- 
ean period suddenly gave way to the curved lines and Flemish influ- 
ence that were popularized by a king and queen who had an intense 
love of their own personal belongings and cared little for English 
tradition. 
The carefully ordered structure is evident in the simplicity of 
the upper chest where elaborate ornamentation would only serve 
to disorganize an imposing front. Here the cabinet maker has 
given greater freedom to his expression in the designing of the 
underbracing in lower section and the first evidence is seen of an 
appreciation of form alone as an element of interest and beauty 
without the added requirement of the play of light and shade that 
is produced by carving. 
The general character of this piece of furniture is one of com- 
parative lightness as compared to the earlier styles. The legs are 
elongated and elaborately turned with typical inverted cups. An- 
other type of support at this time is known as the “trumpet” form, 
a name given owing to its resemblance to the musical instrument. 
95 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  The shaped apron is another instance of the importance of line 
and the interesting drawer pulls and key hole hardware which are 
designed for appearance as well as for utility is symbolic of the trend 
of thought of the designers. 
No. 63. DRESSING TABLE 
Circa 1720 
Previous to the time of William and Mary, the structure of a 
piece of furniture was itself carved and ornamented. In addition 
to inlay and carved ornamentation of furniture, cabinet makers 
employed veneering. Veneering is a method of cutting extremely 
thin slices of rare woods with beautiful graining and applying them 
to the surface of the structure, thereby obtaining a rich and interest- 
ing texture that would not otherwise be possible. 
In the illustration the irregular grain of the burl walnut is 
distinctly evident and adds considerably to the charm of this 
delightful piece. 
Many different kinds of wood were introduced after the begin- 
ning of the eighteenth century and veneering gave an opportunity to 
select the most beautiful specimens for surface finishes. 
Burl wood is always cut from the root of a tree. Crotch wood 
is cut from the intersection of branch and trunk. Both types are 
constantly used for veneering. 
The pear shaped drawer pulls in this example also show a typical 
form of hardware used at this time. 
No. 64. QUEEN ANNE TYPE SIDE CHAIR 
1725 
The structural change which occurred in the eighteenth century 
furniture necessarily affected chairs as well as tables and highboys. 
The rectangular joinery was definitely supplanted by the curve as 
already observed. The shape of the human body was now taken 
into account in the construction of chairs, though comfort and ease 
in furniture was not attained until well towards the end of the 
century. 
Under Queen Anne, chair splats were shaped to fit the back and 
shoulders, seats were widened to insure greater comfort and were 
96  
-P-A-G-E-95
more frequently upholstered. Stuffed chairs made their appearance 
very much later. A certain approach to comfort is perceptible in 
the construction of the chair in the illustration affording an ease 
to the sitter unknown to former generations. The comfort evolved 
in furniture designing was a natural result of the adaption of the 
curved and splayed members. This chair has for front legs the 
cabriole or “bandy” leg type and in this case they are of great 
beauty and graceful though rather massive in form. 
Cabriole legs figured prominently in the furniture of this period 
and the succeeding styles leading gradually to Chippendale. The 
term is from the French, and is applied to any leg with a knee form. 
This style of leg was previously used in China and Egypt but the 
later cabinet makers are indebted to the Dutch traders for its intro- 
duction into France and England and later into America. 
The illustration shows a cabriole leg with claw and ball foot 
derived from the Chinese Dragon and Pearl symbolism. The knee 
is decorated with a finely carved shell motif (greatly used at the 
time) repeated also in the cresting of the chair back with a vase 
shaped splat. 
The back frame is of great beauty of line, harmoniously termi 
nating in rear legs of accentuated rakishness. The upholstered cush- 
ion seat is fitted into a framework of delicate curve tapering towards 
the back of the posts. 
Chairs of this sort were covered in a rich variety of materials to 
which the French and Flemish weavers had given vogue in England. 
Damask, velvet, cross stitch, embroidery and leather were used 
on the finer pieces; glazed chintz, calico, India chintz, and serges 
are associated with furniture of more modest character. 
No. 65. QUEEN ANNE TYPE WING CHAIR 
1725-1750 
As the eighteenth century rolled on, the demand for beautiful 
furniture and more luxurious household equipment increased. 
Mention has already been made of the difference in quality 
and workmanship between the finer furniture of the cities and the 
simple furniture of the outlying communities, or that used by per- 
sons of small means. In rural districts the evolution of the decora- 
tive elements of the time were not so marked in many cases and a 
more native expression resulted. 
97
-P-A-G-E-96
On the other hand, in the larger centers, Boston, Philadelphia, 
and New York, where wealth had greatly increased and where a 
real commerce had been established with all parts of the world, the 
inhabitants took great pride in beautifying their homes and living a 
life of ease equal in many cases to that of their brothers in England. 
The improvement in domestic comfort was thus an established 
fact. Wing chairs as shown in the illustration had a comfortable 
flare with easy-flowing lines and inviting substantiality. The up- 
holstery though slight was sufficient to assure ease, the marked slant 
in the back and the wide seat with the curved roll of the arms, were 
all features devised for comfort. 
The closely placed brass tacks lend charm to the decorative 
ensemble. Here again the cabriole leg is shown in prominence and 
its form was so popular that it remained until the close of the cen- 
tury to be definitely supplanted by the introduction of the classic 
Empire forms. Knees of cabriole legs were as a rule ornate, and 
cabinet makers took delight in varied and sometimes weird ornamen- 
tation as in this case where two eagle heads are shown on each 
leg. The legs usually terminated in ball and claw feet not omitting 
the lion’s paw, which occurred frequently. The frame of this chair 
is of mahogany. 
No. 66. GEORGIAN TYPE SIDE CHAIR 
1745-1755 
Of all pieces of furniture, chairs are the most sensitive to new 
influences and the quickest to indicate a change of style. 
Between the Queen Anne period of English furniture and that 
of the fully developed Chippendale style a transitional type occurs 
both in England and America. The evidence of the change is most 
noticeable in the splat of the backs of the chairs. While in the 
Queen Anne type the splat is plain or nearly so, depending upon the 
form of its outline for its principal point of interest, we also find 
a splat that is pierced to some extent. As the piercing increases, 
the transition develops and quite elaborate shapes appear. Carving 
on the splat is usually omitted, or at most it is considerably subdued. 
The chair shown in the illustration is of the type from which 
Chippendale obtained his first inspirations and by introducing a 
great variety of forms and enriching them by carving, he produced 
his most typical work. 
98  
-P-A-G-E-97
This chair is made in mahogany and shows a very much more 
elaborate splat than that shown in illustration No. 64. The shell 
ornament is however shown on the apron and the cabriole legs with 
ball and claw feet continue to be used. On the knee of the cabriole 
is a conventionalized acanthus leaf instead of the usual shell. 
The sturdiness of the chair seat and the well braced legs are part 
of the national instinct of the English for craftsmanship. Substan- 
tiality as well as grace of design plays a large part in the general 
form. 
It must be remembered that all of these new forms in England 
were transmitted to America where equal attention was paid to 
them and where they became an integral part of our native art 
expression. 
No. 67. GCHIPPENDALE TYPE SIDE CHAIR 
1750-1770 
Chippendale is the name of England’s most famous cabinet 
maker. Few can dispute this title to Thomas Chippendale whose 
taste had a marked influence on furniture designing in England and 
America. Through him a new era in design was introduced, the 
effect of which lasted well into the nineteenth century. In fact from 
1750 onward the best pieces produced in England were attributed 
to his pervading genius: Wéith an astounding versatility, it may be 
said that he commandeered existing styles and wrought each to his 
own use. 
Chippendale was probably the first one of his craft to introduce 
a personal element in his work and he attached his name invariably 
to the output of his work rooms. Being a good business man as 
well as a clever advertiser, he created a great vogue for his produc 
tion in the fashionable circles of England. 
He was the first to publish a reliable text book on furniture 
designing which he called: “The Gentleman’s and Cabinet Maker’s 
Directory.” 
Before Chippendale, the cabinet maker seldom had his name 
associated with his work. From Chippendale’s time onward, how- 
ever, it became fashionable for the popular craftsmen to publish 
books on their designs and they did not hesitate to label their pieces 
with their names. 
As can be seen in the illustration, Chippendale constantly made 
use of certain features employed by his predecessors. One of these 
99 
LIBRAKY 
MIVULE TENNESSEE StAiE COLLEG? 
MURFREESBORO, TENNESSFF
-P-A-G-E-98
was the cabriole leg found on most of the earlier pieces. Another 
feature he retained and elaborated upon was the general outline of 
splat back chairs. However with Chippendale the solid splat was 
completely discarded for elaborately pierced and interlaced fretted 
patterns. The present illustration will show that, although indulg- 
ing in elaborate ornamentation and scrolling, Chippendale preserved 
from his English predecessors the staunch structural framework. 
Through a distinctly personal expression Chippendale gave the 
best of his art to the creation of new detail in chair forms and 
resorted freely to foreign sources from which to draw his inspir- 
ation. 
The art of China, of France and of Holland attracted his closest 
attention. Gothic motifs also played an important part in his vocab- 
ulary of expression. 
He drew freely from salient features of Oriental art and 
made furniture which accompanied other English forms without 
undue incongruity. 
The rectangular legs of the chair, in the illustration are a 
complete assimilation of Chinese fretwork. The cabriole leg has 
been discarded in this case and it is particularly interesting to note 
the very pleasant assimilation of these Chinese legs with the chair 
back of marked French influence. The juxtaposition of different 
elements, Chippendale carried out freely, not only in chairs but also 
in tables, desks, book-cases and other pieces of furniture. 
The back splat is a characteristic Chippendale design of rare 
beauty and grace, with finely interlaced flat strapping and carved 
ribbon motif. The top rail is also beautifully carved. A faint 
reeding can be noticed on the framing. 
The piece was evidently made by an experienced cabinet maker 
who closely followed either an original Chippendale model or 
adapted to his use forms taken from Chippendale’s book which had 
a wide circulation in this country. 
No. 68. CHIPPENDALE LADDER BACK TYPE ARM CHAIR 
Circa 1760 
This is another example of Chippendale’s adroit handling of 
curves and rectangles in the same piece. Ladder back chairs such 
as these had horizontal bars, or slats, springing from the uprights, 
100 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  
and echoing the pattern of the top rail. They were pierced and 
often interlaced as well. The slats occurred in flat, moulded, reeded 
and carved forms. 
In the present case, this chair is of great dignity and restraint. 
Gracefully curved arms with acanthus leaf carvings, reeded fore 
legs of rectangular joinery, and noticeably splayed rear ones, with 
leather covered seat attached by a double row of tacks, result in an 
ensemble of great compositional beauty. 
In America about the time of the Revolution, divers styles of 
chairs were produced, which formed a transitional period between 
Chippendale and Hepplewhite, though most of them are inferior 
in design to the English master cabinet maker’s examples. In some 
of these later chairs the Dutch back was partially reverted to, with 
the uprights and top joining in an unbroken line. Mahogany was 
the popular wood. Beech however was also used. 
No. 69. PIER TABLE—MAHOGANY WITH MARBLE TOP 
Attributed to William Savery. Circa 1760-1775 
During the second half of the eighteenth century, pier or con- 
sole tables, as they are more often called, were introduced into both 
England and America. The American Colonists, with solidly estab- 
lished art precepts, were by now enjoying greater ease in living and 
were appreciating furniture of decorative as well as utilitarian value. 
In this marked step towards European sophistication, Chippendale’s 
influence was undoubtedly strong. 
Chippendale and his immediate successors took pleasure in de- 
signing side tables of great variety, and the accompanying illustra- 
tion, is one of them. These side tables were placed against the wall 
as a rule, and were purely ornamental. The objects found upon 
them were likewise ornamental in character, porcelains, silver and 
fine candelabra being customary side table decorations. Ornate 
mirrors of large proportions were also frequently to be seen hung 
over these pieces. It was not until later, with the Brothers Adam, 
than another oblong table of much the same character, namely the 
sideboard, was introduced. 
To return to the present pier table, we find here the ever grace- 
ful cabriole leg of slender form with delicately carved acanthus leaf 
scrolls, terminating in ball and claw feet. In this case, the most 
elaborate designing has been introduced on the rich scalloped skirt-

ing with unusually beautiful fretwork. The marble top adds con- 
siderably in giving to this piece the last touch of sophisticated 
elegance. 
The introduction of this elegance in English and American furni- 
ture can be largely ascribed to Chippendale who in turn derived his 
forms principally from Chinese and the contemporary French art. 
To the baroque element in Italian decoration, he also acknowledged 
a great indebtedness. The baroque style was the final result of the 
Italian Renaissance. Its basis was the exaggerated use of classic 
forms resulting in a great wealth of florid ornamentation and a free 
use of curves and scrolls. The rococo style which succeeded the 
baroque, went even further in ornamental extravagance, using 
rocks, shells and other rustic details from whence the name is derived, 
(“rocaille et coquille” the French for rock and shell). 
No. 70. MAHOGANY POLE FIRE-SCREEN 
1750-1780 
Fire screens were among other small articles of furniture to be 
found during the eighteenth century. These screens with their 
framed needle point panels of bright hues added considerably to the 
color interest in often sombre interiors. 
With the earlier fire screens, the screen proper was contained 
between two uprights, surmounted by elaborately carved crestings. 
The screen remained close to the ground and was supported on 
either end by short legs. The bottom rail and lateral framing were 
all of equally elaborate carving. Screens of this type were placed 
directly opposite the hearth. 
The popularity of these screens ceased with the Georgian period. 
The screen illustrated in the accompanying photograph is a later 
development, with a small movable panel, worked up and down an 
elongated pole. 
This screen is of graceful proportion and of well balanced line, 
with cabriole legs forming a tripod. The legs and delicately turned 
pole are of mahogany. The piece can be placed between 1750 and 
1780. 
The shape of the frame varied. Often the oval or shield shape 
used by Hepplewhite in his chair backs was used.

No. 71. HEPPLEWHITE TYPE SHIELD BACK 
MAHOGANY SIDE CHAIR 
1785-1790 
It has been said by discerning critics that in the American 
adaptions of Hepplewhite’s formulas of design, the best Colonial 
furniture came into being. George Hepplewhite, a contemporary 
of Thomas Chippendale in that charmed period in England when 
the art of cabinet making was lifted to a high level and actually 
placed on a pedestal by a sincerely admiring public, was one of a 
group of craftsmen whose distinction produced a series of styles 
all bearing the names of their authors. 
The Brothers Adam, also contemporary colleagues of Chippen- 
dale and Hepplewhite, infused in their designs, classic ornaments 
which were to take the place of the baroque tendencies which so 
characterized Chippendale’s work. Hepplewhite followed in the 
Brothers Adam’s wake, going directly to classic sources for inspira- 
tion without passing through the medium of French influences 
of a too stylistic and rococo nature. Hepplewhite occupied, it 
may be said, the middle place between the Adams and Sheraton, 
another classicist of the time. 
The Adam, Hepplewhite and Sheraton styles can best be de- 
scribed as refined and of a general slenderness of frame heretofore 
unrealized in this manner. Urns, reeding, wreaths of flowers, 
festoons of drapery, ram’s heads, fan ovals, swags and knots of 
ribbon were all familiar motifs used at the time. 
Along with this pronounced classic tendency of thoroughly Bri- 
tish practical invention, a great deal of late French influence, that 
of Louis XVI, is to be found in some of Hepplewhite’s best work. 
The same spirit was reflected on our side of the Atlantic and, as 
already stated, has possibly left us our most valued examples of 
Colonial taste. 
As in the case of Chippendale, chairs occupied perhaps the 
greatest place in Hepplewhite’s expression. His chair patterns were 
distinctly of a personal character, and in their backs, he exhibited 
skilfulness and resourcefulness of design, based on classic formula. 
As shown in the present illustration, Hepplewhite’s chair backs 
did not, as a rule, join the rear seat rail, but were supported by a 
short extension of the back legs. The shield back was usually to 
be found as in this case but the oval and heart shape was also used. 
They were either balustered or barred, showing more often fine 
105
-P-A-G-E-104
  carved, curving balusters, converging in a semi-circle at the point 
of the shield. Other backs had central pierced splat of various 
designs. The seats were broad and, as a rule, upholstered. The 
cabriole leg was definitely abandoned in Hepplewhite for straight 
ones. The rear legs were splayed as in Chippendale pieces. 
No. 72. HEPPLEWHITE TYPE SHIELD BACK 
SATINWOOD ARM CHAIR 
Circa 1780 
We find various types of ornament used on the shield back chair. 
In this instance, differing from that shown in No. 71, the shield 
back has a central openwork splat in the form of a vase, instead 
of the converging balusters just observed. The delicately carved 
splat in this case is surmounted by a sheaf of wheat, a form very 
commonly used by this designer. The three feathers of the Prince 
of Wales were also frequently worked into these backs, sometimes 
forming the entire splat. Urn forms were also often to be seen. 
In the present chair, the dignified formality of the back is 
plainly indicative of grace, lightness and beauty of contour. 
Heaviness and massiveness made little appeal to Hepplewhite and 
his followers and a certain practicality was always in evidence as 
indicated in the square, tapering legs. Rounded legs occurred also. 
A new form and one to be attributed directly to Hepplewhite is 
found in the so-called spade foot. Some chairs had supporting 
stretchers. The seats were square or slightly rounded in front and 
sometimes the seat frame was visible. This, however, was excep- 
tional, most chair seats being completely upholstered. 
The arms in this case swing outwards and drop with a sweeping 
curve to join the seat. In other armchairs, the arms run horizon- 
tally to the back, at a sharp angle. The arms were, as a rule, 
slightly reeded and of the utmost simplicity. 
Much of Hepplewhite’s work was in mahogany. He was also 
a great exponent of lighter, figured woods, using inlay extensively. 
Satinwood, tulip, sycamore, rosewood and other woods were widely 
used. Furniture painting likewise figured prominently in the decor- 
ative schemes of his finer pieces which were extremely copied in 
America.

No. 73. SHERATON TYPE, MAHOGANY SIDE CHAIR 
1790-1800 
Much of the furniture produced in this country at the close of 
the eighteenth century, and at the beginning of the nineteenth, is 
the successful blending of Hepplewhite and Sheraton styles. Ameri- 
can Empire was to follow some time later. The Adam Brothers’ 
influence was not appreciably felt on this side of the Atlantic in 
furniture design, but the classic feeling which so strongly animated 
these contemporary designers’ work is to be felt on all sides. 
As previously stated, the classic epoch was a natural reaction 
from the over elaboration of the early eighteenth century, which 
overemphasized the baroque and rococo forms in decoration. After 
visiting the excavations of the Roman ruins of Herculaneum and 
Pompeii, in Italy, conducted during the mid-eighteenth century, 
Robert Adam brought to England his impressions of Roman classic 
beauty. It was a fresh stimulus for a new expression. A com- 
plete revolution in taste was felt in Europe and a new code of 
aesthetics was introduced, reaching in time to our American shores. 
Simultaneously with the aesthetic revolt came the breaking away 
from the mother country. The new modes of aesthetic expression 
in Europe, in consequence, did not reach America till well at the 
close of the War of Independence. 
Thomas Sheraton’s influence was felt here just at this time. 
The classic forms which he pushed even further than Hepplewhite 
are easily discernable in the present chair. 
Sheraton was a marked exponent of the straight line, this pref- 
erence being emphasized in chair backs. His chair backs were nearly 
all severely rectangular and, for the most part, square. 
The chair in the illustration shows the typical Sheraton form, 
with raised top rail in the center supported by reeded balusters in the 
shape of columns. The central splat is in the form of a classic 
urn, surmounted by the Prince of Wales plumes. The front legs 
are rounded and the rear ones square, with somewhat slighter splay 
than is found in Hepplewhite. The seat is broad and upholstered 
and decorated with an effective festooning of brass nails.

  No. 74. TIP-TOP TABLE CHIPPENDALE TYPE 
Philadelphia Make. Circa 1790 
Philadelphia, the proud city, where the Declaration of Independ- 
ence and the constitution of the United States were drafted, the 
home of William Penn and Benjamin Franklin, is the cradle of our 
Republic and of our deep-rooted idealism. Philadelphia during the 
eighteenth century was a cultured center of great importance. Arts 
and crafts were flourishing. Prior to 1750 Philadelphia had a small 
group of well established cabinet makers and upholsterers. After 
this date, however, and up to the close of the War of Independence, 
the furniture industry and allied arts grew considerably. In 1785 
the Quaker City boasted of fifty cabinet makers and eighteen chair- 
makers’ shops. The trade was well established and a particularly 
skilled group of designers adapted the best Chippendale models for 
the taste of a wealthy and cultivated local clientele. 
Tea drinking was generally prevalent in the Colonies and the 
society of the time gathered around small tables to drink tea and 
discuss current activities. Tables such as the one illustrated were 
in general use during the second half of the eighteenth century. 
Here we have the tripod form with beautifully proportioned 
cabriole legs, terminating in the familiar ball and claw foot. The 
use of the delicately carved acanthus leaf on the cabriole legs is also 
familiar. The tops of these tables were hinged and turned up and 
placed against the walls when not in use. The tops were sunk, 
as in this case, and the binding rim, delicately carved and fretted. 
These table tops were called “‘pie-crust”, a prosaic but very descrip- 
tive term. Pie-crust tops were not general with all tea tables, how- 
ever, some were also plain. 
The upright shaft supporting the top showed fluting, as a rule, 
and emerged from a bulb or vase form, directly above the tripod. 
Tea tables such as this one are decidedly Chippendale in design. 
The more elaborate ones were of mahogany.

No.75. DUNCAN PHYFE MAHOGANY DROP-LEAF TABLE 
Circa 1805 
Duncan Phyfe, who was next to the oldest son of a large family, 
left his native Scotland in 1783 to come to America. Phyfe’s 
family, upon landing on the American continent, proceeded to Al- 
bany. It was here, at the age of sixteen, that he began to learn 
the cabinet maker’s trade. After a short period of apprenticeship, 
Phyfe opened his own shop in Albany, but finding his efforts did 
not meet with sufficient compensation, moved to New York. There 
he established himself firmly as a cabinet maker and he spent the 
remainder of his life in that city. He employed as many as a hun- 
dred men in his shop and served a distinguished clientele, names of 
which later were to be associated with the metropolitan wealth of 
New York. 
Duncan Phyfe is generally acknowledged as the best American 
cabinet maker with the possible exception of William Savery of Phila- 
delphia. He excelled in line, proportion and detail, and his execution 
was almost perfect. Sheraton undoubtedly influenced Phyfe, but 
his work was never lacking in a distinctly personal feeling, and he 
succeeded in creating a style which can safely be called American. 
Strangely enough, this sensitive artist’s work is only just beginning 
to meet with the recognition it deserves. 
Phyfe’s production can be placed under three headings—first, 
the Sheraton-Adam influence, the American Empire period, and 
finally, the “butcher furniture” period. With the so-called “butcher 
furniture,” the taste displayed in Phyfe’s pieces, as a rule, depre- 
ciated. For this, however, he is not to be blamed. This deterioration 
was entirely due to the deplorable fashion of the time. He had 
to satisfy a clientele, clamoring for atrocities in furniture. Phyfe’s 
finer pieces were produced, for the greater part, before 1818. 
Duncan Phyfe paid great attention to the designing of tables. 
They were basically classic, as in the present case, and mounted on 
pedestals. Here the pedestal consists of two elaborate turnings, 
mounted on four graceful legs of pronounced sweeping curve. This 
is one of Phyfe’s most salient characteristics. It was not until 1830 
that he made tables with vertical legs, placed at four corners, and 
this was only because of the demand. 
The present table has a drop leaf with clover leaf cut-outs for 
corners. Duncan Phyfe preferred mahogany to other woods and 
used it on nearly all occasions.

  No. 76. SHERATON TYPE SECRETARY 
Circa 1800 
Much of Sheraton’s work was executed along “perpendicular” 
lines, a term particularly applicable to the pieces of high shouldered 
construction. This perpendicularity in no sense led to an ungraceful 
or ungainly aspect. Sheraton’s continuous usage of the straight 
line not only opened the way for new formulas of expression in the 
designing of furniture but also avoided certain constructional difh- 
culties necessarily encountered in the use of rounded forms. 
The perpendicular structure of Sheraton pieces are proportion- 
ately tall. By the continual use of reeding and fluting in legs and 
upright, Sheraton added considerably to the perpendicular aspect in 
his furniture. 
The delicacy in the detail of his work made his output eminently 
suitable for drawing rooms, reception rooms, boudoirs and salons; in 
fact, in all rooms of light and refined intention. 
In the present desk with bookcase top, we find the back case 
superstructure receding several inches from the chest proper. The 
front writing leaf is upheld by two concealed slides when in use. 
This bookcase is of impressive design and extremely refined in 
detail. The glass windows show delicate framework of Gothic in- 
fluence. The crowning pediment of the case proper is of equal deli- 
cacy of proportion. Wooden knobs as seen in the accompanying 
photograph were extensively used by imitators of Sheraton’s work. 
Sideboards were frequently flanked by reeded stile, as in the present 
instance. It is not necessary to draw attention here to the extreme 
beauty of the figured wood applied to the front of this piece. 
The wood is mahogany, inlaid and veneered. 
No. 77. MAHOGANY DESK 
Circa 1770 
This desk was undoubtedly made during the period which just 
preceded our Revolutionary War, a period rich in the production 
of fine furniture. 
Massive in construction, yet graceful in design, the body is 
supported by four short cabriole legs with adjoining plinths, the 
legs terminating in ball and claw feet. The design of the cabriole 
legs in this case is logically treated considering the low base and the 
110
-P-A-G-E-109
  general heaviness of the piece. The graceful serpentine front and 
the delicate mounts on the drawers serve to eliminate undue severity. 
When opened, the slanted top is supported on either end by 
slides fitted into the topmost drawer. The slides are conveniently 
pushed back into place when the desk is not in use. In addition to 
the six small drawers, the top is fitted with pigeon-holes and other 
proper fittings for writing materials. Other secretaries had book- 
case tops. Both type of secretary desks enjoyed great popularity 
in America. 
No. 78. MAHOGANY SECRETARY WITH CABINET TOP 
Circa 1770 
This fine American piece is not only of unusual beauty but also 
of historic interest. General Washington used it during the early 
days of the Revolutionary War, while stopping at the Craigie house 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts. (See Illustration No. 7). It is 
markedly baroque in conception and of the best eighteenth century 
taste. The ornate top is flanked by slender pilasters and sur- 
mounted by a delicate denticulated cornice. Topping the piece is 
a bust, showing close resemblance in features to the great Shakes- 
peare. A more logical association would be hard to find for a 
secretary equipped with books. 
The “bombé” base is also of great beauty of line. The four 
drawers have been gracefully and ably fitted into the warped form, 
which also shows the “block front” treatment so typical of New 
England. 
Chippendale had a tendency, through French influence, to 
exaggerate the “bombé” front at times. In this American example, 
however, the line is extremely graceful and the contour gives the 
base a logical substantiality. The base rail is also ornate forming 
part of the finely cut and carved supporting legs. The piece well 
shows the height of aesthetic attainment reached by our Colonial 
craftsmen.

No. 79. CHIPPENDALE TYPE HIGHBOY 
Philadelphia Make. Circa 1790 
The influences which Chippendale, Sheraton and Hepplewhite 
exerted on our people were longer in coming and were less readily 
discarded than they were in England. Let us not forget that our 
ancestors were far away from the activities of the Old World and 
that a certain delay was to be expected. 
It has already been stated that Philadelphia was an active centre 
of culture and that here provinciality was not so apparent. In 
consequence, furniture modes from Europe were treated with 
sensitive understanding, and from the Philadelphia workshops some 
of our best Colonial furniture was delivered to an eager public. 
The present highboy of Philadelphia make will serve to show 
that our Colonial makers, at times, if they did not surpass, at least 
equalled their brothers from across the sea. This highboy is of 
unusually mature design and workmanship. Here the upper section 
is slightly narrower than the lower. The upper section with four 
large drawers was surmounted by a swan neck pediment with 
unusually beautiful carved scrolling. The lower section consisting 
of three drawers and ornate skirting is mounted on four cabriole 
legs, also lavishly carved and terminating in ball and claw feet. 
Adroitly placed in the lower portion of the piece, is the familiar 
scalloped shell, flanked by extremely delicate scrolls in the French 
taste. The sides of the piece are flanked with ornate carving and 
under the moulding separating the upper and lower portions, a 
delicate Greek fret has been introduced. The brass mounts are 
characteristically Georgian. 
Highboys were often parlor pieces. The Colonists apparently 
thought nothing of opening the numerous drawers in front of 
guests, in an effort to find some necessary piece of household 
linen. This type of furniture was necessary to the needs of the time, 
there being no closets in those days. Every well equipped household 
boasted of several highboys. 
No. 80. BLOCK-FRONT KNEE-HOLE DRESSING TABLE 
Circa 1775 
Block front furniture appears to be of distinctly American 
origin. Virtually no furniture of this character was ever imported 
from England. The name “block front” is derived from the contour 
112 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  
  of the front chest portion, which the drawer fronts also follow in 
form. 
The block front was applied to a wide range of drawer furniture 
including scrutoires, high cabinet desks, low and high chests of 
drawers, knee-hole dressing tables and other pieces. This very 
distinctive type of mobiliary expression probably originated in New 
England. To Rhode Island, however, must be accredited the 
honor of producing the best block fronts. John Goddard of 
Newport made the earliest block fronts in that city. He was 
undoubtedly the finest American cabinet maker of the Revolution- 
ary period and, with the exception of Duncan Phyfe, the greatest 
master cabinet maker of this country. 
The present knee-hole dressing table can very safely be attri- 
buted to John Goddard because of its rare beauty and expert crafts- 
manship. Among other distinctive features of this “dressing table, 
ogee-curved bracket feet of great beauty of design are to be found. 
Added to each of these is a cabriole form terminating in a small 
volute skilfully suggesting additional support. 
The fronts were not constructed of sections of wood glued onto 
plain surfaces, but were cut from solid blocks of wood. In the 
present example the tiers of drawers are convex, the knee-hole 
taking the place of the usual concave panel ordinarily found on 
writing desks and chests of drawers. 
Worked into the upper drawer and on the recess panel, in 
great conspicuousness, are familiar shell carvings. It will be noticed 
that the central shell of the drawers and the knee-hole panel is 
concave, while the two shells of the flanking panels are convex 
and consistent with the convex block form. 
No. 81. MAHOGANY BLOCK FRONT DESK 
Circa 1775 
Here is another example we should not hesitate to attribute 
to John Goddard due to its marked characteristics and perfect 
execution. Goddard unquestionably was a great creative crafts 
man and the new forms he introduced added considerably to our 
vocabulary of art expression. He worked in Newport where he 
catered to a wealthy and flourishing clientele. The pieces attri 
buted to him are invariably of mahogany. 
Goddard was a great admirer and disciple of Thomas Chippen- 
113
-P-A-G-E-112
  dale and was known to have used Chippendale’s book “The 
Gentleman’s and Cabinet Maker’s Directory” in his Newport 
workshop. He introduced rococo elements in his work directly 
traceable to Chippendale. 
We are concerned here with a typical Rhode Island block front 
desk showing the concave central portion of drawers flanked by 
convex ends. The wide and scrolled bracket feet give adequate 
structural support to the piece. In its practical arrangement this 
desk is not unlike its Chippendale and early Georgian prototypes. 
The drop front is supported by the usual slides and the little gallery 
of drawers and pigeon holes are built on serpentine lines. The 
only shell ornament here appears in concave form on the little 
compartment dividing the upper part of the desk in two. 
Simplex block fronts were made in New Hampshire and 
Connecticut toward the end of the century. 
No. 82. SHERATON TYPE FLAP TABLE 
Circa 1805 
A perplexing similarity at times exists between furniture that 
was made in this country under the Hepplewhite and Sheraton in- 
fluence. Much can be said about one that applies equally well to 
the other. As a rule, however, Sheraton had been a decided ex- 
ponent of the straight line and he had felt the influence of classic 
Italy to a greater degree. This classicism had also come through 
the France of Louis XVI. The association of these related forms 
had resulted in some of the finest furniture of the period. It is 
often an easy matter to confuse the work of Sheraton with the 
products of the great master cabinet makers of France. This same 
intermingling of detail was transmitted to the work in this country 
—not only through the books that were brought here, but also by 
the many craftsmen that came from England shortly after our 
Revolution. 
The flap table shown in the illustration can safely be placed in 
the group that was copied from Sheraton’s designs of French in- 
fluence. It also shows an originality of line in the general shape of 
the flap. Sheraton had been a prolific designer of tables and had 
originated forms that had not been seen before. Corner wash 
stands were a novelty at this time, card tables, work and sewing 
tables were other types in which he specialized and which were 
largely copied in this country. 
114
-P-A-G-E-113
Other characteristics of work done under the Sheraton influence 
were the great importance given to the appearance of the materials. 
He had been a firm believer in inlay and veneer. Painted decora- 
tion he used with restraint, limiting it largely to small inserts. 
No. 83. DUNCAN PHYFE DINING TABLE 
Circa 1810 
This unusually beautiful sectional table is mounted on three 
characteristically Phyfe pedestals, each supported by a four-legged 
base, elaborately carved with acanthus leaf pattern. This charming 
and imposing piece is eleven feet six inches in length and four feet 
ten inches wide. The legs terminate in lion’s paw feet of brass. 
Brass was in great demand and used to excess during the Empire 
period. Phyfe did not approve of the excessive use of it in 
furniture as a decorative adjunct and, in consequence, used it 
sparingly. 
The characteristic design of this table is unmistakably Phyfe’s. 
Through balance and well adjusted proportion, he succeeded in 
avoiding any suggestion of disproportionate ungainliness. One of 
Duncan Phyfe’s favorite decorative motifs was the lyre, a form 
favored in Europe during the Empire period. This detail was 
commonly introduced by him in chair backs and table bases. Phyfe 
was a devotee of curved lines and his table and chair legs were 
of rare grace. Carvings were executed by him with utmost care 
and precision. 
Nos. 84 and 85. AMERICAN LOOKING GLASSES 
Very few-looking glasses were made in the American Colonies 
prior to the Revolutionary War. In the early days of our 
Republic, however, the mirror industry was a profitable one. The 
greater number of these mirrors or looking glasses are of New 
England origin. Mirrors were extensively used as over mantels 
at the close of the eighteenth century. After 1805 the Empire 
style came into vogue and with it the production of a great 
quantity of medium sized looking glasses. Only a few of the 
looking glass makers’ names are left to us. 
These craftsmen, in the later types of mirrors, introduced some 
115
-P-A-G-E-114
  of very novel designs. A great many of the pieces designed were 
crude, but nevertheless are not without unsophisticated charm. 
Looking glasses of the Queen Anne period in America were 
highly carved and gilded. An exceedingly popular type of mirror 
was mounted between uprights on small drawer stands. Mirrors 
of this sort were conveniently moved about the room from one 
piece of furniture to another. 
The Chippendale type mirror, illustration No. 84 in walnut 
and gold combines the styles of Queen Anne and Louis XV. The 
use of swan neck curves and the urn as decorative features at the 
top of the mirror is typical of the Queen Anne period, while the 
leaf motifs and reversed curves used on the sides show the influence 
of the French rococo style which was frequently used by Chippen- 
dale, probably because it presented an excellent opportunity for 
this talented carver to enrich his furniture designs by this means. 
The illustration No. 85 shows three unusually fine American 
looking glasses. The central and largest one of elegant refinement 
is the earliest, dated about 1790. The two smaller ones are of the 
first quarter of the nineteenth century. 
The earlier one is of wood and plaster composition, elaborately 
carved in places, and gilded. It is somewhat reminiscent of the 
Brothers Adam- in grace of design. A delicate urn forms the 
central ornament at the top, from which garlands of flowers grace- 
fully unfold, connecting smaller urns at the sides. The fretwork 
and pilasters are of rare beauty. In the upper section is seen an 
allegorical painting on the glass. 
To the left of this large mirror is another one of formal dignity 
but very much simpler and less pretentious than the one just 
described. The simple moulding of plaster and gilt wood is 
typical of the period. A delightful little decorative painting, also 
on glass, shows American flags artfully grouped around a slender 
urn covered with foliage. A great many of these little paintings 
were extremely crude in execution, but the present one is of rare 
beauty and most skilfully rendered. 
The looking glass to the right is much the same in intention as 
the one on the left, in the illustration. There is this difference, 
however, that there are two paintings in this case, one at the top 
showing the American eagle and a smaller one at the base, of 
decorative rosettes. It must be remembered that the eagle was 
chosen as our national emblem at the birth of our Republic and as 
116
-P-A-G-E-115
  
such filled a place of unique importance in the minds and hearts 
of our people. Accordingly, the American eagle was very widely 
used as a decorative motif in our furniture and art crafts. 
Nos. 86 to 89. WALL PAPER 
The history of wall coverings can be traced with as much in- 
terest as that of any of the other arts. In the Gothic days of. the 
middle ages in Europe the great stone walls of the fortified castles 
were covered both for warmth and beauty.. 
Cordova leather and tapestry were the most popular materials 
and they were enriched by either diaper pattern or pictorial rep- 
resentation. Eventually painted canvas and dyed cloths were found 
to be cheaper substitutes. Paper was not introduced into England 
until the sixteenth century, coming thence from Spain, Holland and 
China. Its popular use developed slowly. 
The earliest papers that came from China were colored by hand. 
The early European makers however found this a slow and costly 
process and soon turned to the hand-block process. 
The earliest use of paper in the Colonies was of course in the 
imported article, and both English, Dutch and French products 
have always competed with the domestic output. The earliest 
manufacture of wall papers in this country did not begin until well 
toward the middle of the eighteenth century. 
The designs were usually copied from Chinese originals or 
Indian printed cottons. 
Illustration No. 87 shows a Chinese pagoda pattern, the original 
of which is now in the Marblehead Historical Society at Marble- 
head, Mass. Flock papers were also made imitating the Italian cut 
velvets. Flower patterns and pastoral representations were made 
both in neutral grays and vivid colors. 
The popularity of pictorial wall papers was due to their 
illustrative value at a time when wall pictures were less common 
than they are today. 
The subjects varied widely. Hunting scenes, classic mythology, 
and scenes of localities were the choice of many of the owners of 
the more pretentious houses. The new nation made its impression 
on the art and designers of the Old World and on the great wall 
paper manufacturing centers of Europe. Patterns were made that 
would readily sell in the new and fast growing market by appealing 
not only to the age but also to the patriotism of the young country. 
117
-P-A-G-E-116
  
  A design of which many examples have been found, particu- 
larly in houses of the Greek Revival, was the pictorial paper known 
as “Scenic America” (see illustration No. 89). The complete set 
consists of thirty-two strips showing a panoramic view of scenes 
in the Eastern portion of the United States, including New York 
harbor; the Natural Bridge, Virginia; Boston Bay and West Point. 
The paper was made in France about 1835 by the hand block 
process. It is interesting to note that over one thousand separate 
blocks were needed in making the prints and it took three months 
to complete the set. 
The popularity of this series eventually waned and the original 
blocks disappeared, and were only recently discovered. They are 
now being used again in an old factory in France. The reprint 
shown in the illustration gives a view of West Point. The cadets, 
the steamboat and the costumes have a strong appeal both for their 
decorative value and their quaintness. 
Nos. 90 and 91. TOILES DE JOUY 
“Toile de Jouy” is the French name given to a fabric that was 
manufactured in one of the suburbs of Paris named Jouy by a 
Bavarian named Oberkampf. 
Oberkampf established his factory during the reign of the ill 
fated King Louis XVI. His designs were nearly all pictorial in 
character and made from wood blocks. They were printed in one 
color, usually red, on a white or cream colored linen or cotton cloth. 
The subjects that he used followed the demand of the period in 
which he was working. Under the King, pastoral scenes and senti- 
mental groupings sold readily and harmonized with the decorations 
and living conditions. His output grew to comparatively large 
dimensions and he was eventually ennobled. 
During the American Revolution the sympathy of the Court 
of France was strongly with the struggling patriots. Oberkampf 
popularized allegorical subjects associated with the victorious Col- 
onies and used these motifs not only to sell in his own country, but 
to open up an American market. He was aided by both Franklin 
and Jefferson, both of whom had lived in France after the war and 
had learned to appreciate his product. 
There are many examples of “toiles” which were sent to this 
country. Illustration No. 91 shows one of them now in the col- 
lection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

Both Washington and Franklin and the “Liberty Tree” are seen 
in the allegory here depicted. 
No. 92. COVERLETS AND BEDSPREADS 
During the whole of the eighteenth century, the heyday of the 
four-poster bed, coverlets and bedspreads were considered a neces 
sity. The Colonial houswife, with charactristic resourcefulness, 
wrought fabrics with the materials at hand that are beautiful in 
color and design. 
These coverlets were made in all sections of the country from 
New Hampshire to Georgia, and the patterns used were the com- 
mon property of the women throughout the land. No doubt pat- 
terns or “drafts,” as they were called, were passed on from one 
woman to another and styles in coverlet designs were adopted in 
much the same manner as fashions in clothes today. However, the 
housewife generally acted upon her own initiative and departed 
more or less from the draft by modifying the design and choosing 
her own color schemes. 
A knowledge of the decorative weaving employed in making 
coverlets was undoubtedly the result of the European traditions 
being carried to America. These coverlets were woven throughout 
the eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth centuries. The 
fine craftsmenship of these hand woven coverlets is recognized today 
and they are in great demand by collectors of America. 
The materials used in their manufacture consisted of the founda- 
tion of cotton or linen overshot with wool. In a great number of 
cases the flax was spun, the linen woven, the yarn made and dyed, 
and the coverlet woven out by one woman carrying out each suc 
cessive process at her own fireside and using only such materials 
as the home farm supplied, for not a few of the eighteenth century 
housewives were as expert with the loom as they were with the 
spinning wheel, and they were likewise adept in the mysteries of 
the dye-pot and knew how to make strong and durable vegetable 
colors whose freshness time has been powerless to dim. 
The more popular colors for coverlets were red, white and blue, 
though yellow and green were sometimes used. 
Quilted bedspreads were as popular as woven coverlets. There 
is a distinction between the pieced and the patched quilt. The 
former has the whole surface composed of contiguous pieces of mate- 
119 
   
-P-A-G-E-118
  rial of the same color or of various colors, stitched together in 
geometrical or random patterns and then quilted down. A 
“patched” or patchwork quilt has the surface decorated with pieces 
or patches of another colored material applied or appliqué at inter- 
vals so that its pattern is silhouetted on the background. These 
pieces are then quilted down to the body of the quilt and the lines 
of the quilting are made to enhance the design created by the 
appliqué. Patchwork as a rule had more originality and variety of 
decoration than did piecing. The bedspread illustration No. 92 
shows a typical example having a highly conventional central bal- 
anced motif within the diagonal web held together by a border of 
leaf motifs which alternate in position. The surface units are red 
and the diagonal bands are green and black, placed upon a white 
background. The border is treated in green and black. 
Nos. 93, 94 and 95. HAND MADE RUGS 
Colonial rugs were made of vari-colored woolen yarns worked 
upon a coarse canvas foundation. The surface has a nap of chenille 
like effect. The worker chose his own color and design, the latter 
consisting of geometrical elements or nature forms treated generally 
in a naturalistic manner. These may be interesting and quaint but 
generally speaking they are weak in design and do not compare 
favorably with the coverlets and bedspreads in this respect. 
Of the examples reproduced as Nos. 93, 94 and 95, the latter is 
the more successful from a decorative standpoint. The color scheme 
consists of soft pastel shades of red, yellow and green on a gray 
background. 
The color scheme of the hooked rug having a bird motif decora- 
tion consists of red birds and green foliage on a warm dark gray 
ground. 
The door step rug in which the cats are shown, gives one an 
idea of the quaint simplicity which characterized the colonial house- 
wife who constantly used the animals of the farm yard and house- 
hold, the trees of the meadow and roadside and even the farm house 
and the out buildings themselves as decorative motives. These 
were nearest at hand and being in front of her eyes were easiest to 
reproduce. 
The braided rug and rag rug were in quite as much use as the 
hooked rug, but as only a haphazard pattern was used in their pro- 
duction, less interest is attached. :

I. The English Colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New 
Hampshire, Rhode Island and Maine. 
In studying the records of Colonial days which have come down 
to us in the form of letters, contemporary portraits and inventories 
of personal effects, we are able to reconstruct to a certain extent 
the variety of dress in the different Colonies. 
The modes were largely influenced by the character and tem- 
perament of the settlers. In New England the Puritans, in revolt 
against the frivolities of the English Court, expressed their disap- 
proval by an apparel of “sad colour’d” hues, which was frequently 
carried to an extreme by fanatics. Laws were passed regulating the 
use of luxuries in dress. In 1634 the Massachusetts court ruled 
against “any apparell, either woolen, silke, or lynnen with any lace 
on it, silver, golde, silke, or thread.” It was also forbidden to “make 
or buy slashed clothes, other than one slashe in each sleeve and an- 
other in the backe”; nor should there be “‘cutt works, imbroid’d or 
needle work’d capps, bands and Rayles; no Gold or silver girdles, 
hatt bands, belts, ruffs, beaver hatts.” In “Every Man out of his 
Humor”, Weedon says: ““When the court was not occupied with 
grave business of state, it devoted itself to correcting morals and 
regulating dress. The function of dress in the minds of the anxious 
fathers was not only to cover and protect people, but to classify 
and arrange them. The same conserving prejudice which marked 
their treatment of labourers and apprentices controlled their notions 
of dress. Social prestige, rank, caste, and breeding were to be 
formulated in the garments of the wearer. It was not only that 
the precious capital of the community was wasted by expensive 
dressing, but the well ordered ranks of society were jostled and 
disturbed by the glitter of lace and the show of silken hoods, the 
tramp of strong boots.” 
The Puritan woman usually wore a costume of simple material 
though varied in shape. The paintings of the late George H. 
Boughton, R. A., “The Return of the Mayflower,” “Pilgrim Exiles” 
and “Pilgrims Going to Church” give us an accurate picture of the 
costume worn by the Puritan Colonists of Massachusetts Bay. 
The men wore a suit of black cloth consisting of a short- 
waisted doublet and breeches finished with black ribbons. The stock- 
121 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  ings were either green or dark gray wool. The collar and cuffs were 
of white Holland. The broad brimmed hat was felt finished with a 
narrow ribbon fastened in front with a silver buckle. The cloak or 
mandillion, as it was sometimes called, was of black cloth usually 
lined with fustian. The Puritan women wore a gown of cloth which 
was “sad colour’d” being either gray, brown or purple. This 
gown was worn out-of-doors turned up and fastened back showing 
the petticoats of homespun or linsey-woolsey. The long apron was 
of white Holland linen. The collar, which fell below the shoulders, 
was of the same material, and was fastened in front with a bow of 
ribbon and the cuffs were turned back over the sleeves. The hood 
and kerchief were for out-of-door wear. The hood which matched 
the muff was made of dark silk and lined with fur. For cold 
weather a cloak and hood of thick cloth were provided as well as a 
velvet mask for protection from the wind. The stockings were of 
wool which, together with a pair of stout shoes with wooden heels, 
finished her costume. 
II. The Middle Colonies: New York, the Jerseys, Pennsylvania 
and Delaware 
The Dutch Period in Manhattan Colony 
As there were no restrictions placed by law on the material or 
manner of their dress, the Dutch Colonists carried with them to the 
New World the prevailing costume of Holland. In her “History 
of New York” Mrs. Lamb tells us that Peter Stuyvesant, the Gov- 
ernor of New Amsterdam, “twas never otherwise than faultlessly 
dressed and always after the most approved European standard. 
A wide drooping shirt collar fell over a velvet jacket with slashed 
sleeves displaying full white linen shirt sleeves. His breeches were 
also slashed, very full and fastened at the knee by a handsome scarf 
tied in a knot, and his shoes were ornamented with large rosettes.” 
The gowns of the matrons of the upper classes were of bright colors 
and made of costly materials. They wore a loose jacket or samare 
with a skirt which reached to the knee, sleeves turned back at the 
elbow, and faced over a waistcoat and petticoat. The dress of the 
men was also elaborate, being of silk, satin and velvet with trim- 
mings of fur and lace. 
Boughton in his painting “The Edict of William the Testy,” 
which hangs in the Corcoran Gallery at Washington, shows us a 
122
-P-A-G-E-121
  
group of burghers dressed in the costume of the time which usually 
consisted of slashed doublet and full breeches of cloth or velvet, 
which ended at the knee and were fastened by silver buckles; a 
black satin waistcoat was sometimes worn, as well as long velvet 
coats fastened with large silver buttons. The ruff was of pure 
Holland linen, knife-plaited, as you will notice in the early portraits 
by Franz Hals. The felt hat with its soft brim was trimmed with 
plumes. The stockings were wool and the leather shoes had wooden 
heels and were tied with large bows of ribbon. 
When the English took the Colony from the Dutch, very few 
changes were introduced. The men wore long coats closely but- 
toned down the front, of flowered silk with cuffs of rich brocade. 
The full breeches hung over the points with which the silk stock- 
ings were fastened. The shoes were cut high and fastened with a 
leather strap which passed through a buckle on the instep. The 
has was cocked a little to one side; periwigs were worn long and 
full. 
The costume of the women of this period followed closely the 
prevailing London modes. A typical costume would consist of the 
following articles: a gown of rich silk trimmed with a fancy gimp, 
the bodice being cut to a point front and back over a full gathered 
shirt and cut low in the neck, being completed with a falling lace 
collar. From under the short full sleeves of the gown are white 
puffed sleeves which fall to the wrist. The color of the silk shoes 
which are tied with ribbon at the instep, matched the gown. 
The Quakers in Pennsylvania 
In her monumental work “Historic Dress in America”, Eliza- 
beth McClellan describes the dress of the Quakers as follows: 
“A Quaker gentleman wore a suit of dark brown or plum- 
colored cloth cut according to the English fashion at the end of 
Charles II's reign. The full shirt-sleeves hung in ruffles over the 
hand and the neck-cloth, though of the fashionable style and of 
the finest linen, was untrimmed. The hat was of the shape seen in 
the portraits of the time. The absence of feathers and lace was the 
only distinction of Quaker dress before 1700. The hair was occa- 
sionally powdered and periwigs were not uncommon, but the hair 
was usually worn in natural locks parted in the middle and hanging 
to the shoulders. 
123
-P-A-G-E-122
  
The characteristic dress of a Quaker lady consisted of a gown 
of some soft colored silk with fine white kerchief and undersleeves. 
The long full apron was also of silk, probably a dull green. Under 
the black silk hood for outdoor wear a ruffled cap of sheer lawn 
is worn. The hair is arranged in a coil at the back and parted in 
front.” 
The Southern Colonies 
Virginia, Maryland and the Carolinas, 1607-1700 
The dress of the early settlers in the Southern Colonies differed 
radically from that of New England because the former were 
recruited from the ranks of the Cavaliers while the latter were 
Puritans. The wealth of these Colonies was great and, providing 
the tobacco crop was good, rich gowns and doublets were imported 
from England. In order to obtain an authoritative picture of the 
costumes of the period of Charles I, the study of the engravings of 
Wenceslaus Hollar (1607-1677) is advised. This artist made a 
number of plates of contemporary costume among which may be 
noted “The Seasons”. 
From Mr. Bruce’s “Economic History of Virginia” we learn 
that the following list of articles of apparel were in common use. 
“The shirt was made of holland, blue linen, lockram,.dowlas and 
canvas, according to the quality desired; holland representing the 
most costly and canvas the least expensive. The buttons used on 
the shirt were either of silver or pewter, and in many cases were 
carefully gilded. 
“The stockings were either of silk, woolen or cotton thread, 
worsted or yarn. The shoes worn by men were made of ordinary 
leather, or they were of the sort known as French Falls. The 
shoe buckles were manufactured of brass, steel or silver. There are 
many references to boots, the popular footwear of the planters, who 
were accustomed to spend much of their time on horseback. 
“The periwig was worn in the latter part of the century. In 
1689 William Byrd forwarded one to his merchant in London with 
instructions to have it altered. 
“The covering for the heads of men consisted of the Monmouth 
cap, the felt, the beaver or castor, and the straw hat, occasionally 
with a steeple crown. 
124 
   
-P-A-G-E-123
“The neck-cloth, or cravat, was of blue linen, calico, dowlas, 
muslin or the finest holland. The band or falling collar was made 
either of linen or lace in keeping with the character of the suit. 
“The material of the coat ranged from broadcloth, camlet, fus- 
tian, drugget, and serge, which became less expensive with the 
progress of the century, to cotton, kersey, frieze, canvas and 
buckskin. When of broadcloth, it was lined with calico or coarse 
linen. There are numerous references to the stuff coat, and the 
smock, and to the serge or linen jacket. The outer garment used 
in riding was usually a cloak of camlet. The buttons of the coat 
and waistcoat were made of various materials, from silk thread to 
brass and pewter, silver, gimp and mohair. 
“Over the ordinary coat, a great-coat of frieze was worn in 
cold weather, or, on special occasions, a substitute was found in a 
cloak of blue or scarlet silk. 
“Waistcoats in 1679 were made of dimity, cotton or drugget, 
flannel or penistone, of a great variety of colors, white, black and 
blue being the most popular. 
“The breeches for dress occasions were of plush or broadcloth; 
for ordinary wear, of linen, common ticking, canvas or leather. 
There are references in inventories of the period to serge breeches, 
lined with linen or worsted, with thread buttons, and also to calli- 
manco breeches with hair buttons. 
“Occasionally the whole suit was of plush, broadcloth, kersey 
or canvas, or the coat was made of drugget, and the waistcoat and 
breeches of stuff cloth. Olive colored suits were very popular. 
“Handkerchiefs were of silk, lace, or blue linen. Gloves were 
made of yarn ,or of tanned ox-, lamb, buck-, dog’, or sheepskin, and 
were of local manufacture. The hands of children were kept warm 
by mittens.” 
Colonial Costume from 1700 to 1800 
William and Mary—Queen Anne 
As this period was before the dawn of the fashion plate, jointed 
dolls, we are told, were dressed in the latest mode and sent from 
London to the Colonies. We were fortrnate in being able to secure 
a photograph of two of these pupp-sc d-essed in the original cos- 
tumes, which served as models for the mantua-makers. 
125)
-P-A-G-E-124
  
Mrs. Vanderbilt, in her ‘Social History of Flatbush,” says: 
“We have a vivid remembrance of the old age of one of these 
fashion-dolls which had been sent from Paris to a fashionable 
mantua‘maker in New York. When the dress was changed as to 
style, the dressmaker sold the doll to one of her customers, and 
‘Miss Nancy Dawson’ passed into the obscurity of humbler dollies, 
who had never been sent as ministers plenipotentiary from the 
Court of Fashion.” 
In the Colonial room of the National Museum at Independence 
Hall in Philadelphia may be seen one of these dolls which is de 
scribed in Miss McClellan’s “Historic Dress in America” as follows: 
“This fashion doll is dressed in a Watteau sacque of taffeta 
(a white ground with cross-bar lines of red) over a hooped petticoat 
of the same trimmed with a pinked flounce. The stomacher is 
plain without a point, but finished by robings of the silk from the 
shoulder to a little below the waist line. An apron of soft green 
silk is worn under the stomacher. The sleeves end at the elbow 
and are finished with graduated ruffles of the silk pinked, very deep 
in the back and short in the front; a knot of red, the prevailing color 
of the costume, is on each sleeve and also in the hair, which was 
powdered and worn close to the head, probably in French curls. 
Red slippers with high heels, a necklace, and bracelets complete this 
genuine ‘fashion-baby’s’ attire.” 
The costume of this period for men was generally as follows: 
Clothes of dark red broadcloth with trimmings of gold braid and 
buttons; a fine linen cravat with lace at the ends, and a three cor- 
nered hat edged with feathers. A periwig which fell to the shoulders, 
and shoes with red heels completed the costume. 
George I and George II 
The study of the paintings of William Hogarth will enable the 
student to clearly visualize the dress of this period. Primarily these 
satires were painted to expose the dissoluteness and hypocrisy of 
English life, but the details of the costumes differ but little from 
those of the Colonists as most of the apparel of both men and 
women was directly imported from London. 
F. M. Caulkins in her “History of Norwich” tells us that 
“Women of mature age wore close linen caps. Parasols and um- 
brellas were unknown or of rare occurrence, but a fan 
126
-P-A-G-E-125
nearly a foot and a half in length and spreading like the train of a 
peacock was often carried to keep off the sun as well as to catch the 
air. At one period feathers were much worn upon the head, sur- 
mounting a high turban of gauze or muslin raised on wire and 
adorned also with ribbon. 
“A lady in full dress for great occasions displayed a rich brocade 
with open skirt and trained petticoat trimmed with lace; an em- 
broidered stomacher and full ruffles at the elbows. Hood and scarf 
were of silk. No sumptuary laws restrained the feminine taste 
for rich attire at this period. When the ladies walked out they 
threw the end of the train over the right arm. The foot was dressed 
in a silk stocking, a sharp-toed slipper with a high heel was often 
made of embroidered satin.” 
Watson in his “Annals” says: “The women in Philadelphia 
wore caps (a bare head was never seen), stiff stays, hoops from six 
inches to two feet on each side, so that a full-dressed lady entered 
a door like a crab. High-heeled shoes of black stuff with white 
silk or thread stockings, and in the miry times of winter wore 
clogs, galoshes, or pattens. 
“Ladies often had their hair tortured for hours at a sitting, in 
getting the proper crisped curls of a hair curler. Some who designed 
to be inimitably captivating, not knowing they could be sure of 
professional services where so many hours were occupied upon 
one gay head, have actually had the operation performed the day 
before it was required, then have slept all night in a sitting posture 
to prevent the derangement of their frizzles and curls. This formid- 
able head work was succeeded by rollers over which the hair was 
combed from the forehead. These again were superseded by cush- 
ions and artificial curled work, which could be sent out to the bar- 
ber’s block like a wig to be dressed, leaving the lady at home to 
pursue other objects, thus producing a grand reformation in the 
economy of time and an exception from former durance vile. 
“When the ladies first began to lay off their cumbrous hoops, 
they supplied their place with successive succedaneums, such as 
these, to wit: first came bishops—a thing stuffed or padded with 
horse hair; then succeeded a smaller affair under the name of 
cue de Paris, also padded with horse hair. How it abates our 
admiration to contemplate the lovely sex as bearing a roll of horse 
hair or a cut of pork under their garments! Next they supplied their 
place with silk or callimanco (a substantial and fashionable woolen 
stuff) or russell thickly quilted and inlaid with wool, made into 
127 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  petticoats; then these were supplanted by a substitute of half a 
dozen petticoats. No wonder such ladies needed fans in a sultry 
summer, and at a time when parasols were unknown, to keep off the 
solar rays!” The same authority also says: ‘Once they wore a 
‘skimmer hat’? made of a fabric which shone like silver tinsel; 
it was of a very small flat crown and big brim, not unlike the 
late leghorn hats. Another hat, not unlike it in shape, was made of 
_ woven horse hair woven in flowers, and called ‘horse hair bonnets’; 
an article which might again be usefully introduced for children’s 
wear as an enduring hat for long service.” 
In “Historic Dress in America” is described the following suit 
of uncut velvet worn at this time by Robert Livingston, third Lord 
of Clermont Manor on the Hudson, New York. Coat and breeches 
are of the same material covered with a small design in soft shades 
of red and green giving a pinkish hue to the costume. The long 
waistcoat is of corded silk, a shade darker than the coat and em- 
broidered by hand with a very graceful flowered pattern in which 
the soft red and green of the suit prevail. It is a very beautiful 
costume in material, color and design. The buttons are covered 
with velvet, and the coat and waistcoat are lined throughout with 
white corded silk and the knee breeches with heavy swanskin (can- 
ton flannel) while the pockets of the latter are lined with white kid. 
Small straps of the velvet fasten with buckles below the knee. 
George III, 1760-1776 
This period, which ended with the Revolution, was distin 
guished by the rich costumes worn by men as well as women. In 
old inventories such gorgeous apparel as green silk breeches, flowered 
with silver and gold, silver gauze breeches, yellow fringed gloves, 
laced shirts are noted. Watson in his “Annals of Philadelphia” 
says: “In those days dress was discriminative and appropriate, both 
as regards the season and the character of the wearer. Ladies 
never wore the same dress at work as on visits; they sat at home 
or went out in the morning in chintz; and brocades, satins and 
mantuas were reserved for evening wear or for dinner parties. 
Robes or negligees, as they were called, were often worn in full 
dress. Muslin gowns were not worn at all. Children’s dress was 
also elaborate.” 
Anna Green Winslow, a little girl of twelve, tells us in her 
diary bearing the date 1771: “I was dressed in my- yellow coat, 
128
-P-A-G-E-127
  black bib and apron, black feathers on my head, my paste comb and 
all my paste, garnet, marquasett and jet pins, together with my 
silver plume, my locket, rings, black collar round my neck, black 
mitts and yards of blue ribbon (black and blue is high taste) striped 
tucker and ruffles (not my best) and my silk pompedore shoes 
completed my dress.” 
As the great struggle for liberty gradually overshadowed the 
land and the sacrifices necessary to consummate the Revolution began 
to be appreciated, a decided change took place in regard to dress, 
amusements, and display. Women discarded all important orna- 
ments, and arrayed themselves wholly in domestic goods, fine wool 
and choice flax were in higher estimation than silk and laces, and the 
hearts of the patriots as well as the laudations of the poet were 
given to beauty in homespun garments. Gentlemen also that had 
been accustomed to appear in society in the daintiest costume, fol- 
lowing the example first set by the women, discarded their shining 
stocks, their cambric ruftles, silk stockings, silver buckles, and other 
articles of foreign production, and went back to leather shoe strings, 
checked handkerchiefs, and brown homespun cloth. 
The encouragement of home manufactures and the rejection 
of all imported luxuries were regarded as tests of patriotism. Com- 
mon discourse grew eloquent in praise of plain apparel and Labra- 
dor tea. The music of the spinning wheel was pronounced superior 
to that of the guitar and harpsichord. Homespun parties were 
given where nothing of foreign importation appeared in the dresses 
or upon the table. Even wedding festivities were conducted upon 
patriotic principles. In the larger cities, New York and Phila- 
delphia, however, there was much gaiety, as the following extracts 
from “Costume of Colonial Times” by Mrs. Alice Morse Earle 
show: “By Benjamin Franklin’s day Philadelphians were as fond of 
dress as were other Americans. Even that rigid and thrifty econ- 
omist sent home from France, to his Deborah and his daughter, 
silk negligees, white cloaks and plumes, satin cardinals, and paste 
shoe-buckles that they might not ‘dress with singularity’.’ By 
Revolutionary days Philadelphia outdid other towns in folly, and 
surpassed them in lavishness; coming to a climax of astonishing 
frivolity and extravagance in that extraordinary revel, the Mischian- 
za—a pageant more resembling a royal masque than an assembly in a 
staid Quaker town. General Greene declared the luxury of Boston 
“an infant babe” to that of Philadelphia. Another officer wrote to 
General Wayne: “The town is all gayety, and every lady and gentle- 
man endeavors to outdo the other in splendor and show.” 
129

  The Republic (1776-1800) 
The “Lansdowne Portrait” of George Washington by Gilbert 
Stuart, which hangs in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, 
Philadelphia, and which we are able to reproduce through the cour- 
tesy of the directors, is an accurate example of the costume worn 
by men in the closing years of the eighteenth century. 
The clothes fitted the figure more closely. Coats were cut 
shorter in the waist and the tails were cut away in front and worn 
long in the back. Great-coats of camlet with short capes orna- 
mented with large buttons and cut long in the waist were popular 
for outdoor wear. In 1794 the cocked hat was superseded by the 
straight-brimmed hat. A soft stock was worn. Sometimes the 
costume was made up of nankeen breeches and a plum-colored 
coat with a high collar. The prevailing dress for women during 
this period consisted of a high-waisted dress of glazed cambric with 
long sleeves, puffed at the shoulders. The following description 
of the first Inauguration Ball in 1789 by Col. Stone will prove of 
interest: “Few jewels were then worn in the United States, but in 
other respects the dresses were rich and beautiful, according to the 
fashion of the day. We are not quite sure that we can describe 
the full dress of a lady of rank in the period under consideration, 
but we will make the attempt. One favorite dress was a plain 
celestial blue satin gown with a white satin petticoat. On the 
neck was worn a large Italian gauze handkerchief, with border 
stripes of satin. The head-dress was a pouf of gauze, in the form 
of a globe, the creneaux or head piece of which was composed of 
white satin, having a double wing, in large plaits, and trimmed 
with a wreath of artificial roses, falling from the left at the top to 
the right at the bottom, in front, and the reverse behind. The hair 
was dressed all over in detached curls, four of which, in two ranks, 
fell on each side of the neck, and were relieved behind by a floating 
chignon. Another beautiful dress was a perriot made of gray Indian 
taffeta, with dark stripes of the same color, having two collars, 
the one of yellow, and the other white, both trimmed with blue silk 
fringe, and a revere trimmed in the same manner. Under the per- 
riot was worn a yellow corset or bodice, with large cross stripes of 
blue. Some of the ladies wore hats a l’Espagnole of white satin, 
with a band of the same material placed on the crown, like a wreath 
of flowers on the head-dress above mentioned. This hat, with a 
plume, a popular article of dress, was relieved on the left side, 
having two handsome cockades, one of which was at the top and 
130
-P-A-G-E-129
the other at the bottom. On the neck was worn a very large plain 
gauze handkerchief, the end of which was tied under the bodice, 
after the manner represented in Trumbull’s and Stuart’s portraits 
of Lady Washington. Round the bosom of the perriot a fall of 
gauze, 4 la Henri IV, was attached, cut in points around the edge. 
There was still another dress which was thought to be very simple 
and pretty. It consisted of a perriot and a petticoat, both com- 
posed of the same description of gray striped silk, and trimmed round 
with gauze, cut points at the edges in the manner of herrisons. The 
herrisons were indeed nearly the sole trimming used for perriots, 
caracos, and petticoats of fashionable ladies, made either of ribbons 
or Italian gauze. With this dress they wore large gauze handker- 
chiefs upon their necks, with four satin stripes around the border, 
two of which were narrow, and the others broad. The head-dress 
was a plain gauze cap, after the form of the elders and ancients 
of a nunnery. The shoes were celestial blue, with rose colored 
rosettes. Such are descriptions of some of the principal costumes, 
and although varied in divers unimportant particulars, by several 
ladies according to their respective tastes and fancies, yet as with 
the peculiar fashions of all other times, there was a general corre- 
spondence—the tout ensemble was the same.” 
No. 98. GLASS WARE 
The manufacture of glass in America is associated with practi- 
cally all of the localities of the first settlers. In Jamestown, Virginia, 
both window glass and bottles were made within two years of the 
founding of the Colony. New England started its first bottle fac- 
tory as early as 1639. This was followed in Philadelphia and New 
Jersey where not only articles of simple utility were manufactured, 
but beautiful specimens of the higher class products. 
The earliest American glass was coarse, of greenish tint and full 
of bubbles and sand. Gradually the product was improved and 
great variety of forms were made by both pressing and blowing. 
The two most interesting types of glassware made in this 
country in colonial days were the products of the factory at Sand- 
wich, Mass., and those produced in Pennsylvania of “Baron” Henry 
William Stiegel. 
The memory of Stiegel lives not only for his products but for his 
activities and eccentricities as well. Stiegel came from Germany 
131
-P-A-G-E-130
about 1750 and settled in Pennsylvania. At first he entered the 
iron business in which he made a fortune. His fame as a spend 
thrift seems to have been due to his lavishness and ostentatious 
habits, and the title of “Baron” was probably a nickname. 
Stiegel later went into the real estate business and developed 
the town of Mannheim. In order to create a demand for his prop- 
erty, he decided to organize an industry, and settled upon glass 
making as being one of which he had learned the principles in his 
home town in Germany. It is from this factory, established more 
or less by accident, that his fame chiefly springs. A large variety 
of table and decorative ware was made in both clear, colored and 
decorated types. 
The illustration shows two types of Stiegel ware. Both of 
these objects are well proportioned and the etched design makes 
a delicate enrichment of the surfaces—which is well subordinated. 
No. 99. HARDWARE 
Antique objects, while not always perfect in their conception, 
undoubtedly are superior in merit to the majority of manufactured 
articles. The reason for this is not hard to find. Previous to 1825 
practically everything produced by man was made by hand. The 
flood of machinery had only just commenced its advance and quan- 
tity production was unknown. The individuality and the ability of 
the craftsman was supreme until the second decade of the nineteenth 
century. 
The craftsman is happily guarded in his creation by human 
pride. As a result, thought and even affection is often bestowed 
on what he is making. His ability backed by this pride gives to his 
product the most useful and beautiful character that is within his 
power to create. 
The handwork of the master is never better shown than in the 
making of wrought metal and the thousands of varieties of hard- 
ware that were made in the Colonial period testify to the amount 
of individual study put upon each piece to make it exactly suitable 
for its purpose as well as being an object of interest in both line and 
texture. 
The usual method for hanging doors was by means of the strap 
hinge which was placed on the surface of the door instead of the 
butt end as is the custom today. The strap hinge also served the 
132 
   
-P-A-G-E-131
  
purpose of strengthening the woodwork and preventing warping. 
At the end of the hinge, the blacksmith gave play to his feeling for 
beauty and introduced a point of interest either by flattening the 
end or splitting it into points which were often curved or scrolled. 
Other door hinges were known as the H or HL hinge, names 
given to them from their form, both of which are shown in the 
illustration. 
Locks were always of the surface variety. Although some were 
ornamented by means of hammering or casting, the average house- 
holder of colonial days gave more thought to their strength. 
Police protection was not then what it is today and mechanical 
means of safe guarding took its place. Both iron and brass locks 
were used, the latter of course being the more durable on account 
of its rust resisting qualities. 
The door knocker took the place of the door bell of today. Every 
variety from the most simple to the most elaborate is found. 
Nos. 100, 101 and 102.5 LAMPS, LANTERNS AND OTHER 
LIGHTING FIXTURES 
In studying the history of the methods used by man for illumi 
nating homes after the setting of the sun, one is struck by the curious 
fact that practically no development occurred from the earliest 
dawn of civilization until the nineteenth century had well begun. 
The flame from the candle and the oil lamp were the only two 
sources of artificial light. 
The “Betty” lamp shown at the right of the group in illustra- 
tion No. 100 was probably the earliest type used by our fore 
fathers. It is very similar to the lamps that were used by the Greeks 
and Romans. The body is extremely small, made of iron in the 
form of a shallow saucer. In the saucer was put either animal 
grease or fish oil, and a small wick led from the oil over the 
lip. The flame that came from the wick was extremely meagre and 
must have been most disagreeable due to its smoke and odor. 
The “Betty” lamps were moveable and had both a prong and 
a hook at the top that could either be stuck into a modern post or 
wall or hung from a nail or mantel shelf. 
Some fisherman off the coast of Massachusetts eventually dis- 
covered that sperm oil taken from the whale made a far more satis 
133 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  factory fluid to burn than the fish oil that was the current commod- 
ity for this purpose. Whales were abundant at that time in the 
Atlantic and a new industry developed. The lamp second from the 
right in the same illustration is a typical two-wick whale oil ship 
lamp. The two wicks gave additional brilliancy and the method 
of pivoting in two directions permitted the lamp to remain upright 
in any position taken by the ship. 
The illustration shown to the left of the “Betty” lamp is a reed 
light holder. This was merely a hooked form that supported a 
handful of grass that had been dipped in grease to burn. The odor 
from this form of light did not permit it being used to any great 
extent in the household. It was probably a simple inexpensive form 
of illumination employed in the stables or other outbuildings. 
The iron candle stand with a slip-holder for regulating the 
height of the candle is shown at the extreme left. Here can be 
seen an effort to introduce appearance as well as utility in the 
fixture. The tree legs stood on the ground and were made of light 
pliable material so that they could be easily bent by hand to take 
up the irregularities in the floor. 
The name of Paul Revere has become associated with the form 
of pierced tin lantern shown in illustration No. 101. There seems 
to be no authentic reason for connecting his name with this type. 
Surely by no stretch of the imagination could it have been one of 
these that was hung from the steeple of the Old North Church to 
signal to him on the memorable nineteenth of April in “Seventy- 
five’. The candle that is held within would in itself have been 
impossible to see from his point of vantage across the Charles River, 
even if it were not for the fact that the pattern piercing permits 
only a very small amount of light to sift through. It is far more 
possible that these lanterns were used to carry by hand and to 
illuminate a path or to hang from a wagon for use while on the 
road. 
These lanterns were usually made of tin, which was imported 
from Cornwall at an early date. Tin was much more easily worked 
than iron and a lighter material to carry. The holes in the surface 
of the lantern were so punched that the ragged edges were on the 
ae thus preventing the wind from extinguishing the candle 
ame. 
Illustration 102 shows some typical whale oil table lamps. The 
oil was comparatively expensive and the flame was extremely small . 
134
-P-A-G-E-133
and could only have given at best a meagre illumination. The 
interest in these lamps is in the charm of their silhouette and the 
lovely moldings of which they are composed. 
No. 103. BENNINGTON POTTERY 
In Bennington, Vermont during the first years of the nineteenth 
century was located a firm of potters which for over fifteen years 
produced some of the most unique and quaint specimens of the 
potters art that have ever been made. There is nothing in any 
other country that is similar to them except possibly some of the 
early Staffordshire ware. For this reason, they are not only truly 
native American products but are highly prized by collectors. 
Bennington ware can hardly be compared to the finely moulded 
type of work that was produced by the various well known pottery 
manufacturers in Europe. It is extremely coarse, and crude and 
primarily interesting in its modelling, subject matter and coloring. 
It required much originality and imagination to conceive the 
bottle coachmen (shown in the illustration,) the laughing cows, the 
fierce lions, the diminutive tobys and droll poodle dogs that were 
turned out at Bennington. 
The colors were often mottled. Brown was predominant al- 
though the tones ranged from coffee color to a near black giving the 
effect of tortoise shell. A great variety of other colors was used 
and a multitude of forms, both useful and otherwise. Table ware, 
wash bowls, pitchers, door plates and knobs, and mantel ornaments 
were turned out in large quantities. 
No. 104. STAFFORDSHIRE POTTERY 
Staffordshire pottery is not an American product, but certain 
forms of it were used so extensively on this side of the water during 
the early years of the Republic that we have every reason to asso- 
ciate it with American art. 
The interest and popularity of this ware was due to the pictorial 
element in its patterns, the simple homelike quality in its general 
aspect and the lovely shade of blue in which many of its designs 
were made.

  TANKARD BY PAUL REVERE
-P-A-G-E-135
The English Staffordshire potters in order to create an American 
market decorated their products with scenic views and historical 
events connected with America. Contrary to their own patriotic 
instincts they did not hesitate to use scenes of the American Revo- 
lution to meet the local demand. Their business judgment proved 
to be excellent and a large trade developed. 
The decorative treatment of this ware somewhat suggests the 
patterns of the wall paper used at that time. Both show subjects 
of historical interest although they do not represent the highest 
forms of decorative art. 
The porcelain is of a rather coarse texture that was made to 
sell at a low price. The background is white but profusely covered 
with pattern and figures, so that the general effect is in one color. 
Dark blue was predominant but other tones used were green, plum, 
brown, pink and black. 
The manufacture of Staffordshire ware continued well on into 
the ninteenth century, the visit of Lafayette in 1824 being one of 
the memorable events which was used for decoration purposes. 
The pottery was particularly useful to give color interest. The 
mantels and shelves were often adorned with it and it invariably 
had an important place in the corner china cabinets that were usually 
built into the colonial interiors. 
Nos. 105 and 106. SILVER COFFEE POT AND TANKARD 
By Paul Revere 
The name of Paul Revere as patriot and soldier occupies an 
important place in the Annals of our country while his interesting 
versatility as engraver as well as maker and designer of some of the 
finest examples of Colonial silverware is not so widely known. 
Paul Revere was born in Boston January 1, 1735 and with the 
exception of the period of his military service, lived there all his 
life. He was the son of a Frenchman of Huguenot descent who 
changed his name from Apollos Revoire to Paul Revere shortly 
after his arrival in America in 1723. At this time a great deal of 
the wealth of the country was centered in Boston and there was a 
great demand for fine silverware. His son, Paul, went to the 
famous Master Tileston’s Grammar School and was early appren- 
ticed to learn the trade of his father. He designed and made at this 
137
-P-A-G-E-136
  time teapots, spoons, tankards, pitchers and porringers. He had a 
brief military experience at the age of twenty-one when he went 
with the expedition against the French at Crown Point. Upon his 
return to Boston he devoted his entire time and energies to the 
production of some of the most exquisite examples which have come 
down to us. They are distinguished by their excellent workman- 
ship, correct proportion and graceful lines as well as tasteful decora- 
tion. He was employed by the cultured Boston families who were 
very partial to the embellishment of their silverware by crests, in 
which work Revere excelled. 
Mention must also be made of Revere’s work on copper plate 
engravings. The history of American engraving cannot be written 
without due reference to his abilities in this field. He had a great 
reputation locally as a caricaturist. His style somewhat resembles 
the work of William Hogarth. In 1770 he published his famous 
print of the Boston massacre. In 1775 he was the engraver of the 
first Continental paper money. It is however with Revere’s silver 
that his reputation chiefly lies. The most famous pieces are the 
large punch bowl made for the Sons of Liberty and also the famous 
“Constitution Set” which is preserved in Boston. He designed the 
frames for the portraits of Copley and his own portrait was drawn 
by Saint-Memin in 1804. Shortly before his death in 1818 Gilbert 
Stuart painted his portrait which we are able to reproduce. 
No. 107. GROUP OF AMERICAN PEWTER 
Pewter was in general use in America from 1650 to 1800 and 
was popular in the poorer sections of the country. It is an alloy 
composed chiefly of tin and lead. Early American pewter followed 
very closely by the style and form of English contemporary ware and 
it is quite likely that not a few native craftsmen used English molds. 
Experiments proved that unlike silver this metal was not adapted to 
heavy ornamentation and so the pewterers confined themselves to 
simple forms—such as beakers, plates, porringers and teapots and it 
is probably due to the limitation of the metal that such graceful de 
signs have come down to us. 
The American type of porringer is a small dish with an open- 
work handle. Authorities differ as to the probable use of these 
- dishes some stating that they were used as bleeding bowls by physi- 
cians while others believe they were a general utility dish. They 
138
-P-A-G-E-137
  varied in depth and diameter some measuring five or six inches 
across. 
Pewter teapots are very rare as it was found the metal would 
not stand great heat. In design they were oval, round or pear- 
shaped with an S shaped spout. We find the following advertise- 
ment in the Pennsylvania Gazette of March 22, 1733. 
Announcing “‘to all lovers of decency, neatness and Tea Table 
decorum. Just arrived from London, all sizes of the best white metal 
Pewter Tea Pots, likewise Tea Stands, Cream Sauce Pans, Tea 
Spoons, and other Curiosities, all of which are of the newest fashion 
and so very neat as not easily to be distinguished from Silver either 
by the workmanship or color and will be sold very cheap by retail, 
at Mr. Stones next door to Mr. Samuel Pars in Front Street, Phila- 
delphia by the Importer—” 
In Colonial times great quantities of cider, toddy and rum were 
consumed and in addition to the tankard the tumbler-shaped beaker 
was in common use. The charm of pewter lies in its soft luster 
as well as the evidences of the craftsman in the hammer marks which 
distinguishes all early ware. During the stirring times of the Revo- 
lution great quantities of pewter utensils were melted into bullets. 
No. 108. BANJO CLOCK 
Clock making in the American colonies did not develop until 
the eighteenth century was well on its way. The industry centered 
in New England. Although clocks were made in America before 
the half way mark of the century had passed it is to Thomas Harland 
to whom the trade is most indebted for organizing the industry. 
Harland learned his trade in England and came to this country on 
the same ship on which was held the famous “Boston tea party” in 
1773. He settled in Norwich, Connecticut where he made clocks 
for nearly thirty-five years. 
Harland’s reputation spread over New England and he taught 
the trade to many young men who had been apprenticed to him. 
Among these apprentices was Eli Terry who eventually established 
his own clock making business in the western section of Connecti- 
cut. Terry had associated with him Seth Thomas and Silas Hoad- 
ley. The organization founded by these three clockmakers was the 
predecessor of the great industries now located at Waterbury, An- 
sonia, Terryville and Thomaston. 
139  
-P-A-G-E-138
In Massachusetts, the Willard family was equally well known as 
clockmakers. They antedate the industry in Connecticut by almost 
a generation. There was a constant rivalry between the two 
factions and it is difficult to decide on either the mechanical or 
artistic supremacy of the two groups. There is no question, how- 
ever, that the clock cases made by the Willard family are a delight 
to the eye and the tall case “grandfather” clocks and banjo clocks 
made by them have never been surpassed in form or detail. Illus 
tration No. 108 shows a banjo clock made by Simon Willard about 
1807. 
Other types of clocks that were made at this time were known 
as shelf clocks and wall clocks. The latter consisted of the face and 
works only, the unprotected pendulum swinging free along the 
walls. Varieties of chimes were introduced and in the Boston Gaz; 
ette of 1773 we find an advertisement announcing clocks that play 
“‘a new tune every day of the week and on Sunday a psalm tune. 
These tunes perform every hour.” 
Nos. 109 to 117 inclusive. PAINTING AND SCULPTURE 
Painting in the Colonial period was strongly influenced by the 
great English portraitists, notably Gainsborough and Sir Joshua 
Reynolds. It should be borne in mind that in those early days there 
were no schools of art in America and naturally the young aspiring 
artists of the times were attracted to England to receive instruction 
from the masters of whom they heard such glowing accounts. 
America was not wanting in talent even in those troublous days 
and the people welcomed home their artists who had received their 
training and honors in the mother country. It was quite the fashion 
in those days of pomp and circumstance for the notable men and 
women to have their portraits painted and it is fortunate that this 
was the case, otherwise we would be without any likenesses of 
Washington and other famous people of the period, for the camera 
had not yet been invented. We are moved with a feeling of patriotic 
pride when we recall that Benjamin West, the father of Colonial 
artists, became President of the Royal Acadamy in London and that 
he as well as Gilbert Stuart, Peale, Trumbull, Malbone and 
Copley received the highest honors from the English people. Their 
works today may be found in the National Gallery and other col- 
lections in London. While Benjamin West preferred to live in 
140
-P-A-G-E-139
  
England, his brother painters returned to America to serve their 
fellow countrymen and emblazon their names in American halls 
of fame. 
While the great emotional events of the Revolution inspired 
some of these artists to produce pictures of historical scenes, the 
art of the times was essentially portraiture. It is in this field that 
they distinguished themselves. Sculpture was not in evidence ex- 
cepting for the few works produced by the French sculptor Hou 
don, who came over from France to America to execute some com- 
missions for portrait busts. 
BENJAMIN WEST 
1738-1820 
Benjamin West may be justly termed the father of American 
painters, for that aspiring group of Colonial artists, Peale, Copley, 
Trumbull and Malbone, finding no one in America to teach them, 
went to England and became his pupils. His encouragement and 
influence did much to pave the way for their early success. 
West first plied his art in Philadelphia. One of his early efforts 
at art, at the age of seven years, was a sketch of his sister, sleeping 
in her cradle. His paint brushes were made from the hair of the 
pet cat’s tail; the red and yellow earths given him by the Indians and 
his mother’s indigo pot served him for pigments. With this rudi- 
mentary outfit the young artist produced a picture that attracted 
attention and prompted a friend to give him a box of real paints 
and several engravings. With this outfit young West’s ambition 
was stimulated and he was determined to be an artist. His first 
efforts at portraiture were made at Lancaster, Penna., and they 
had a marked influence in his career, owing to the enthusiasm of an 
inventor who urged him to devote his life to art. He suggested 
that West make a picture of “The Death of Socrates” which he 
attempted at the age of fourteen years. In 1750 he met Mr. Smith, 
provost of the College of Philadelphia, who educated him in classi- 
cal literature. It was during this period that he began to receive 
commissions to paint portraits in Philadelphia for which he received 
from thirteen to twenty-five dollars apiece. Not being satisfied 
with these inadequate financial returns, he visited New York where 
he succeeded in accumulating enough money to go abroad. At the 
age of twenty-one, accompanied by a son of a patron, Chief Justice 
141 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  Allen, West sailed for Europe. In Italy he became filled with the 
spirit of classic revival then in vogue, which resulted in his produc- 
ing in a rather stiff classical manner some subjects of mythology. 
Following three years’ residence in Italy, West went to London, 
where he took a studio and commenced the serious business of life. 
The portrait of Governor Hamilton, painted at this time, hangs in 
Independence Hall, Philadelphia. It was not long before his talents 
_as a painter of historical subjects, of which England at that time 
had none, attracted the attention which won for him the patronage 
of Dr. Newton for whom he painted “The Parting of Hector and 
Andromache” followed by “The Return of the Prodigal Son” for 
the Bishop of Worcester. 
The painter’s introduction to King George HI was the outcome 
of the popularity of his “Agrippina Landing with the Ashes of 
Germanicus”, painted for the Archbishop of York. This picture 
was brought to the attention of the throne, and from that time 
until the King’s mental illness became manifest, he enjoyed the full 
confidence and patronage of the royal family which culminated in 
a contemplated series of pictures on the progress of revealed reli- 
gion. Twenty-eight of these were executed, for his Majesty's 
Chapel at Windsor. These works brought fame to West and 
following this triumph he became one of the founders of the Royal 
Academy, and in 1792 he succeeded Sir Joshua Reynolds as Presi- 
dent of that institution, a post which he held until 1815. 
As a man, West was benevolent and kind as well as liberal in 
imparting his knowledge to others. The youth in America looked 
up to him as one who had achieved great success and one who would 
assist them. 
The “Life and Works of Gilbert Stuart” by Mason, tells a 
story of the young painter's introduction to West, which expressed 
the relationship of our younger painters toward the pioneer and also 
quite clearly his attitude in the matter. Stuart, driven by necessity 
in London to some radical measure to effect a change in his pros- 
pects, called upon West without an introduction. West was dining 
with some friends when a servant told him that someone wished 
to see him. He made answer, “I am engaged,” but added after 
a pause, “Who is he?” “I don’t know, sir; he says he is from 
America.” Thereupon one of the guests, Mr. Wharton of Phila 
delphia, an intimate friend of West's family, offered to go and see 
who it was. He found a handsome youth dressed in a fashionable 
green coat, and after talking to him for some time found that he 
142 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  was a nephew of Joseph Anthony, one of the most important mer- 
chants of Philadelphia, and a friend of Mr. Wharton. Hearing 
that he was well connected, West came out and received the 
visitor cordially. Stuart told him of his long deferred desire to see 
him and his wish to make further progress in his calling, to all of 
which West listened with kindness and attention. At parting he 
requested Stuart to bring him a specimen of his work, which Stuart 
gladly did, with the result that in a few days he commenced his 
studies with West, and in the summer of 1777 he was domiciled 
in the family. At this time Stuart was twenty-two years of age 
and West thirty-nine. 
CHARLES WILSON AND REMBRANDT PEALE 
1741-1827 1787-1860 
Peale was borne in Chestertown, Maryland. He first began life 
as a saddler and later extended his business to include coach build- 
ing, clock making, silversmith work and finally portrait painting. 
It is said that he received advice from John Singleton Copley of 
Boston and later went to England and entered Benjamin West’s 
household, while studying at the Royal Academy in London. 
Returning to this country in 1770 he found constant employ- 
ment and gained considerable reputation in painting portraits in 
Annapolis and Baltimore. In the spring of 1772 he was invited to 
Mount Vernon, where he painted the first portrait of the Virginia 
Colonel, George Washington. He is said to have painted Wash- 
ington fourteen different times. 
Peale took an active part in the Revolution, both as citizen and 
soldier. During intervals of the struggle he found time and made 
a priceless collection of historic portraits, which was to constitute 
his National Gallery, which he established in his home at the corner 
of Third and Lombard Streets, Philadelphia. Many of the paintings 
comprising this collection are now in the City Museum in Inde 
pendence Hall. 
Peale became one of the founders of the Pennsylvania Academy 
of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia and was always interested in ad- 
vancing the art in this city. It is said that he gave much of his 
time in the public schools giving free drawing lessons for the sake 
of developing greater appreciation of art. 
143
-P-A-G-E-142
  An excellent example of his early portraiture, the three-quarter 
length seated figure of Robert Morris, one of Philadelphia’s most 
prominent citizens, the financier of the Revolution, is owned by the 
Academy of Fine Arts. One of Peale’s best portraits is that of 
George Clymer the first president of this well known institution. 
Tt depicts a man of resourcefulness and energy, as we know Clymer 
to have been. 
Rembrandt Peale, a son of Charles Peale, inherited a talent for 
art, and was but seventeen when he painted a portrait of Washing: 
ton, for which he was fortunate enough to obtain three sittings. He 
studied with his father and under Benjamin West and painted por- 
traits in London, Savannah, Charleston, New York and Phila- 
delphia. His best work was done while on a visit to Paris in 1807, 
when he painted the portraits of such distinguished Frenchmen as 
Jacques Louis David, the artist; Domingue Vivant Denon, the 
artist and author, and Jean Antoine Denon, the eminent sculptor. 
They exhibit a certain vivacity of expression and character not 
always apparent in the vast number of portraits he painted in this 
country. 
Rembrant Peale was president of the American Academy, suc- 
ceeding Colonel Trumbull, and was one of the original members of 
the National Academy of Design. His best work was his portrait 
of Thomas Jefferson in the New York Historical Society. Like 
his father, he painted Washington several times, the last and most 
notable portrait being executed in 1823. It was exhibited in most 
of the large cities of the United States and in 1832 was bought by 
Congress for two thousand dollars. He was one of the first to 
practice lithography in the United States and gained a silver medal 
at the Franklin Institute, in 1827, for a portrait of Washington. 
JOHN SINGLETON COPLEY 
1737-1815 
John Singleton Copley was born in Boston, Massachusetts, when 
it was a British Colony. Finding there no opportunities for study- 
ing art, by dint of perseverance young Copley derived from nature a 
knowledge of form and color. In 1760 the young artist had made 
such progress that his pictures attracted wide attention in America 
and England. He became the leading portrait painter of Boston, 
where he lived in a beautiful home fronting on the Common. The 
144 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  
artist Trumbull described him as dressed in a suit of crimson velvet 
laced with gold, and with everything handsome about him. A few 
years later he set out on the usual painter’s tour, going by way of 
England to Rome, subsequently visiting the chief cities of Italy, Ger- 
many and the low countries. Returning to England in 1775 he 
decided to establish himself in London. In the following year he 
was elected an associate of the Royal Academy. In 1776 Copley 
exhibited a picture consisting of a group of portraits and in 1779 
he was elected full member of the Royal Academy. At this time 
he painted his famous picture, “Death of Lord Chatham”, which 
was extremely popular. It is still much admired and is now in the 
National Gallery in London, England. He then commenced a 
series of historical and political pictures, among the most admired 
of which are the “Death of Major Pierson” and “The Death of the 
Floating Batteries of Gibraltar.” 
Unlike West and other American artists of the time, Copley 
was self taught. His manner was his own, born as much from his 
personal character as from his opportunities, and it is no doubt 
better to have him as he is, with all his defects, amply outweighed 
by his merits, than to have had a reflection, however admirable, 
of some other great painter. 
His paintings were well composed and carefully painted from 
life with great attention to accuracy. Contrary to the practice of 
Reynolds and his school, he always faithfully adhered to the actual 
costume of his sitter, and seemed not to be afraid of missing pic 
turesqueness by this adherence to truth. So fond was Copley of 
painting the details of dress and ornament, and so cleverly did he 
imitate, though always with a certain hardness, the texture of 
his costumes and draperies, that someone has called him “the 
inspired silk merchant.” Yet he by no means neglected the faces 
of his sitters and he also painted their hands with great care. Some- 
thing of the hardness we observe in Copley’s painting in the metallic 
texture of his fabrics and the sharp division of his lights and shadows 
are to be accounted for by his early training as an engraver, but 
no doubt he saw things as he painted them. The prose of facts had 
more charm for him than the poetry of appearance. 
West told Leslie that Copley was the most tedious of all paint 
ers. When painting a portrait he used to match with his palette 
knife a tint for every part of the face, whether in light, shadow or 
reflection. This occupied himself and sitter a long time before he 
touched the canvas. 
145
-P-A-G-E-144
  One of the most beautiful of his portrait compositions is at 
Windsor Castle and represents a group of the royal children playing 
in a garden with dogs and parrots. It was painted at Windsor and 
during the operation the children, the dogs and the parrots became 
equally wearied. The persons who were obliged to attend them while 
sitting complained to the Queen; the Queen complained to the King 
and the King complained to Mr. West, who had obtained the com- 
mission for Copley. Mr. West satisfied his Majesty that Copley 
must be allowed to proceed in his own way, and that any attempt 
to hurry him might be injurious to the picture, which would be a 
very fine one when finished. 
The best examples of his work in America are to be seen in 
the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and Harvard College, Cambridge, 
Massachusetts. The famous picture entitled ‘Portrait of the Artist 
and His Family”, in the Boston Museum, is distinguished by a 
greater warmth and softness than are commonly met with in Cop- 
ley’s work, and was painted shortly after he had established himself 
in his English home. It represents himself and his wife, his four 
children and his wife’s father, Mr. Richard Clark. Mrs. Copley, 
a young and handsome woman, sits on a crimson sofa, fondly 
caressing her infant son, the future lord chancellor, while his sister, 
a child hardly a year younger, pleads for her share of the embrace. 
Behind Mr. Clark stands the artist, himself, leaning upon the back 
of the father-in-law’s chair. “Mrs. Boylston” one of the best of the 
artist’s work of women, hangs in the Common’s Room, in Harvard 
College. 
GILBERT STUART 
1755-1828 
Gilbert Stuart is generally conceded to be one of the greatest 
portrait painters that America has produced. He was born at Ham- 
mond Mills, Rhode Island. The humble house dedicated to his 
memory, an old fashioned gambrel roofed structure, still stands and 
it is said that it formed part of the old snuff mill set up by his 
father, who came from Scotland to introduce the manufacture of 
snuff in the Colonies. At an early period in the life of Stuart the 
family removed to Newport; and it is there that we find the earliest 
picture that can be recognized as the work of the painter. This 
is a pair of Spanish dogs belonging to a Newport doctor and is

  said to have been painted by the young artist in his fourteenth 
year. Stuart’s first teacher in drawing was Cosmo Alexander, a 
Scotchman, who visited the Colonies and painted a number of por- 
traits in the manner of that time. On his return to Scotland, 
Stuart accompanied him, but shortly after his arrival in Edinburgh, 
the death of Alexander threw Stuart on his own resources and the 
lad was obliged to work his passage home on a Nova Scotia collier. 
This was in 1773, a period of intense excitement in the Colonies 
which were on the verge of the Revolution, to which Stuart seems 
to have been so indifferent that he reembarked for England two 
years later on the eve of the Battle of Bunker Hill with the object 
of escaping from an atmosphere so little suited to his advancement 
in art, and in quest of instruction from Benjamin West, then the 
dean of American painters, established in London. Arriving in 
London, Stuart seems to have lacked the hardihood to address 
himself, unknown and without resources, to his future patron, and 
picked up a precarious living as an organist of a church on a yearly 
salary of thirty pounds. Finally after two years’ desultory work 
he gained that courage born of necessity to call upon West, who 
received him into his family as apprentice and friend. 
West appears to have had no influence upon the work of the 
young painter. Stuart’s debt to him was nevertheless great since it 
was through his association with the King’s painter that Stuart met 
many of the distinguished members of London Society who after- 
wards became his sitters. West also allowed him time to draw in 
the schools of the Royal Academy and to attend the lectures of Sir 
Joshua Reynolds and Cruikshank, and a year after he went to West, 
1777, he figured as an exhibitor in the Royal Academy. 
In 1782 he painted his so-called chef d’oeuvre, a full length por- 
trait of William Grant, Esquire, of Congalton, skating in St. James 
Park. It was exhibited in the Royal Academy, London, and at- 
tracted attention for its remarkable expression of the motion of 
the skater. This success assured the career of the painter. Com 
missions for portraits came with every post and Stuart lived in a 
state of luxury, spending his money with a royal hand and dis- 
pensing hospitality like a prince. His prices for the portraits done 
were only inferior to those of Romney and Gainsborough, whose 
peer he rapidly became. Stuart remained in London until 1788, 
painting numerous portraits of prominent people who became his 
friends as well as his patrons. He returned to America in 1792 and 
after two years in New York came to Philadelphia. At the time 
147
-P-A-G-E-146
  of his return there were only four portrait painters of note in this 
country. These were Charles Wilson Peale, Matthew Pratt, Ralph 
Earl and John Trumbull, each of them a reputable artist in his way, 
and much more capable than is commonly admitted, owing to the 
fact of their talents having been obscured by the brilliant prowess of 
the new comer, Stuart, whose return marks an important epoch 
in the history of American art, giving it an impetus which lasted 
well on into the century in which he died. When he arrived in 
Philadelphia, during the winter of 1794-5, he made the acquaint- 
ance of Dr. William Smith, Provost of the University of Pennsyl- 
vania. Dr. Smith gave the painter his start in Philadelphia by 
presenting him with a house on his own property at Falls of the 
Schuylkill, in which to live, and providing him a studio in the house 
of his son, William Moore Smith. Later he removed to German- 
town. Stuart painted the portrait of Dr. Smith, his benefactor, 
which was one of the first commissions that he received in Phila- 
delphia and one of his most noted portraits. He also achieved 
within the first few years of his residence here his famous three 
portraits of Washington. 
The collection of twenty-four Gilbert Stuarts is the glory of” 
the galleries of the Pennsylvania Academy of The Fine Arts in 
Philadelphia. No better opportunity can be found for the study 
of Stuart’s art than is afforded by this collection, which is undoubt- 
edly the best representation of his work in any museum. Stuart 
lived about ten years in Philadelphia and after a short sojourn in 
Washington, removed to Boston in 1805 and there he remained 
until his death, July 27, 1828. Notwithstanding his great success 
as a painter, he died leaving his family practically destitute, except 
for the original of his famous head of Washington. 
The piece de résistance of the Stuart collection is the full 
length portrait of George Washington painted in 1796 and fami- 
liarly known as the Lansdowne portrait. 
The vignette head of Washington, which was retained by Stuart 
during his life, is now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The 
Gibbs-Channing portrait of Washington, now in the Metropolitan 
Museum, New York, was sold to Stuart’s personal friend Colonel 
George Gibbs, of New York. It is a forceful likeness of Washing- 
ton in the latter years of his life. 
In all his work Stuart was preeminently a colorist and his 
place, judged by the highest canons of art, is unquestionably among 
148
-P-A-G-E-147
  
  the few recognized masters of portraiture. No master before or 
since has given so true an impression of the color of flesh, and in 
his proficiency he seems never to have fallen into a recipe, the pitfall 
of success. His work divides itself into two distinct periods. The 
first, or English period, reflects the influence of the great painters 
of Great Britain. It is marked by a delicate precision in the drawing 
and by a slight artificiality of coloring, whose pearly grays suggest 
the similar effects of Romney and Gainsborough. His second period, 
developed in America, exhibits a robustness, a vigor, a strength 
of characterization and a richness of color that carry him beyond 
the limitations of the cleverest of the British School. As a rule, 
Stuart’s in the canvas centres very palpably upon the head, but 
while he sometimes slighted the accessories of the portraits he 
painted, there is sufficient evidence to prove that he understood 
to a remarkable degree the painting of detail and of textures. On 
the subject of backgrounds he said, “Backgrounds should contain 
whatever is necessary to illustrate the character of the person. 
The eye should see the application of the parts to the whole, but 
without separating or attracting the attention from the main point.” 
JOHN TRUMBULL 
1756-1843 
Among others who came to England to study under West was 
John Trumbull, the painter of “The Battle of Bunker Hill” and 
of “The Signing of the Declaration of Independence”. Trumbull, 
the son of Jonathan Trumbull, the Colonial Governor of Connecti- 
cut, was born in Lebanon, Connecticut in 1756. He was a graduate 
of Harvard University at the early age of seventeen, and seems to 
have had a love for learning. Art attracted him at an early age 
and he made copies of the few pictures he had access to in Boston. 
He learned much from the paintings of Copley, who was then liv- 
ing in Boston. After leaving college, Trumbull amused himself 
with painting, and it is a sign of the times that he dived for subjects 
into ancient history; trying his hand at “The Battle of Cannae”, 
“Brutus Condemning his Sons” and the like. But, fortunately 
for his fame, he was shortly to find subjects here, at home, which 
concerned him and us more nearly. The war with England broke 
out, and to avoid being made a clergyman, which was his father’s 
ambition for him, he entered the army and was made an adjutant of 
149 
   
-P-A-G-E-148
  militia, as he says, before he had ever seen a regimental line formed. 
While at his post the “Battle of Bunker Hill” was fought, and in 
painting his picture of that memorable conflict, eleven years later 
in England, he drew upon his imagination for the facts, since it was 
impossible that he should have had any personal knowledge of the 
action. All that he could have seen from Roxbury, where he was 
stationed at the time of the battle, was the smoke of the burning 
village of Charlestown. In 1777 he retired from the army and went 
to Boston where he renewed the study of painting. Here he re- 
mained until 1779 and in 1780, having made the acquaintance of 
Mr. Temple, afterward first Consul-General of Great Britain to the 
United States, who assured him that he might safely go to London 
to study under Mr. West, he embarked for France and in August 
of that year passed over to England. 
Here he studied with Benjamin West, and owing to his arrest by 
British authorities who were suspicious of him owing to his previous 
service in the American army, he was requested to leave the coun 
try. After a series of misadventures he reached America in January, 
but with health much impaired by a long and disasterous voyage, so 
that he was disabled for work until the end of the next summer. 
After a period in business with his brothers, he returned to England 
after peace was declared and was again kindly received by Mr. 
West, who employed him to make a copy of his “Battle of La 
Hague”, one of the series of historical pictures in which West 
celebrated the victories of the English, and of which the “Death 
of Wolfe” is the best known. In the intervals of his work upon the 
copy, Trumbull painted his first original composition, “Priam Bring- 
ing Back to his Palace the Body of Hector.” This picture was 
no more than a school-work in the manner of West, and is chiefly 
interesting as showing him in the very beginning of his career adopt- 
ing the style to which later he owed his distinction; the figures 
painted in miniature in oil, the heads finished with great spirit and 
with a touch at once delicate and free. Had Trumbull never at- 
tempted large works, but contented himself with small canvases on 
which the originals of his “Bunker Hill”, “The Death of Montgom- 
ery” or “The Sortie from Gibraltar” are painted, or had he left 
nothing more behind him than the oil studies in miniature for the 
paintings in the rotunda of the Capitol at Washington, his reputa- 
tion would have been much greater than it is today, for unfortun- 
ately, while these smaller works still remain to us, and while those 
150  
-P-A-G-E-149
  
of them that are in the gallery at New Haven are well cared for, 
they are seen there by few persons, and little valued by the public, 
while the larger pictures in the Capitol are seen yearly by thousands 
of people, and by them Trumbull is unhappily judged. 
Trumbull’s “Battle of Bunker Hill” represents the moment when 
the British troops, by the failure of American ammunition, had be- 
come the masters of the field. General Warren had just been killed 
and he forms the central point of interest in the picture. He is sup- 
ported by a soldier, who strikes aside the arm of a British grenadier, 
who would bayonet him to avenge the death of Colonel Abercrom- 
bie, a favorite officer of his company, who is dead at Warren’s feet. 
Colonel Small, an intimate friend of General Warren, is rushing to 
his relief but comes too late. At the left of the picture is seen the 
face of General Putnam, who is ordering the retreat of the Ameri 
cans; while a part of the troops fire a parting volley at the enemy. 
Behind Colonel Small is Colonel Pitcairn of the British marines, 
who has just been mortally wounded and is supported in the arms 
of his son. General Howe, who commanded the British forces, is 
seen behind the principal group, and still further in the distance the 
enemy ascends the hill bearing the British colors, while in the back- 
ground are the royal man-of-war, Somerset, a portion of the town of 
Boston, and the smoke that rises from the burning village of 
Charlestown. 
EDWIN GREENE MALBONE 
1777-1807 
Edwin Greene Malbone was born at Newport, Rhode Island, in 
1777. Young Malbone early showed a strong inclination for art, 
and in his case, as in that of West, he displayed a mechanical inge- 
nuity in supplying what was necessary in the way if implements, 
not so easily procured then as now. He made his own brushes, and 
searched the beaches for paint stones, as he called them, to grind up 
for such colors as he needed. He would color the cheap prints that 
came into his hands or drew on bits of ivory or bone, with India 
ink, figures of gods and goddesses, set them in frames of twisted 
wire and won smiles of favor from the girls at school to whom he 
offered the pretty gifts. Curiously enough, Malbone’s first public 
appearance as an artist was as a scenepainter. At sixteen Malbone 
151

painted upon paper a miniature copy of the handsome face of Sir 
Thomas Lawrence, using an engraving as a model, and it seemed 
so excellent to his father and his friends that it was decided he must 
be allowed to follow his bent and become an artist. As there was 
no artist nor drawing master in Newport who could give the boy 
lessons, his father sent the picture by a friend to a French miniature 
painter in Philadelphia, who recognized the boy’s talent, but made 
such hard terms for his instruction that his father could not comply 
with them. The boy, however, was not to be turned from his pur- 
pose and, telling no one but his sister of his plans, he boldly set out 
for Providence and, arrived there, offered himself to the public as 
a miniature-painter in earnest. He was so well received that he 
determined to remain there for a time and wrote to his father telling 
him of his success and throwing himself upon his kindness and 
affection for forgiveness for his rash step. He remained in Provi- 
dence until 1796, when by the advice of friends he went to Boston, 
where he met with the same success that he had enjoyed in Provi- 
dence. In Boston he met Allston again, whom he had known 
slightly in Newport, where Allston had been sent from his native 
State of South Carolina for the benefit of his health. The acquaint: 
ance soon ripened into friendship and from that time they were 
as much in one another’s company as circumstances permitted. In 
1801 Malbone accompanied Allston to London, where he was re- 
ceived with flattering interest by West, who assured him, on seeing 
his miniatures, that no one in England could compete with him in 
his own field, and he said some years afterward, when in conversa’ 
tion with Mr. Monroe, afterward President of the United States, “I 
have seen a picture painted by a young man of the name of Mal- 
bone which no men in England could excel.” While in London, 
Malbone, who was always anxious for improvement, took a term of 
lessons in drawing at the Royal Academy, and Dunlap says that 
“after his return to America his work showed the good effects of 
this discipline.” 
JEAN ANTOINE HOUDON 
1741-1828 
The earliest patronage of sculpture in America dates back to 
1785, when the State of Virginia gave to Jean Antoine Houdon 
(1741-1828), the most famous living sculptor of France, a com: 
153

mission to make portraits of Lafayette and Washington, both of 
which are installed in the State Capitol at Richmond, Virginia. 
For the studies of Washington, Houdon crossed the ocean in 
1785 at the solicitation of Franklin and Jefferson and spent two 
weeks in Mt. Vernon making studies of the future President and a 
life mask of his features. Houdon sailed with Franklin from Havre 
on the twenty-second of July, 1785. He was with Washington 
for fifteen days and returned to France direct, reaching home Janu- 
ary fourth, 1786. A remarkable bust of John Paul Jones, the naval 
hero of the Revolution, is in the collections of the Pennsylvania 
Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia. It was presented to 
General William Irvine, a Pennsylvania general in the Revolution. 
Houdon is celebrated for his great skill as a portrait maker. His 
work gives the impression of noble and forceful personalities and 
possesses all the merits of strength, virility and character.

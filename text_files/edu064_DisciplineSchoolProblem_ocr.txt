  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
So long as boys are boys and girls are girls and 
teachers not perfect in training and insight teach, the 
problem of discipline will continually recur in the ad- 
ministration of our schools. In the whole field of 
school and classroom management probably no other 
school problem causes teachers and principals so much 
perplexity, and all kinds of devices have been pro- 
posed and tried with a view to minimizing the amount 
of trouble from this source. 
The author of this volume has attempted to outline 
a treatment of the problem from a new angle. In- 
stead of outlining a series of devices, or laying down 
a number of rules to guide teachers under different 
conditions, he has attempted to analyze the problem 
by going,to the root of the matter. As a physician 
would study a case coming under his observation, and 
diagnose the case in the light of certain well-estab- 
lished laws, so the author has analyzed the problem of 
discipline by going back to the real causes of misbe- 
havior. This he has done in the light of our knowl- 
edge of the evolution of humankind, and from the 
standpoint of certain well-established psychological 
principles. 
The distinct contribution of this volume lies in this 
method of analysis of the problem, and the diagnosis

made is made in the light of how best to deal with 
racial instincts and tendencies. The book is an at- 
tempt, and a very successful attempt at that, to offer 
to teachers and principals a method for the diagnosis 
and treatment of school disciplinary problems, similar 
to that used by a physician in outlining a plan of 
treatment for a patient he is called in to see. The 
individual rather than the mass, though often under 
“mass conditions; “the case,” rather than the general 
disease of which the case is an example; individual 
analysis and treatment, rather than the application 
of general school-made rules; and a line of treatment 
paralleling the direction of racial evolution, and the 
swerve of the race toward civilization and away from 
brute force and law; — these are fundamentals in the 
analysis of the problem which the author has here 
outlined. The threefold division, dealing with the 
problem first from the standpoint of the child as an 
individual, then as a member of a school class, and 
finally as a part of an organized social institution, the 
school, adds materially to the value of the treatment. 
The volume here presented should prove of much 
service in normal schools and teachers’ training classes, 
in starting the thinking of new teachers on the prob- 
lem in the right direction; but it should be particularly 
illuminating to teachers and principals in service, as 
they are in position to appreciate better the value of 
the fundamental treatment here laid down.

DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL 
PROBLEM 
INTRODUCTION 
The morale of the school. It is with some diffidence 
that one to-day offers to discuss the question of dis- 
cipline with his fellow-teachers. For these are the days 
when we are told either that the problem of discipline 
has been completely and finally solved, or else that 
discipline has never been a problem. The fact is, how- 
ever, that there are still some thousands of teachers, 
daily face to face with the actual work of the class- 
room, to whom “discipline” is a vital matter such as 
it never can be to the closet philosophers in education. 
It is in the light of this fact that one finds his inspira- 
tion to attack the subject of “discipline as a school 
problem.” y 
Certainly this is the most serious, the most com- 
prehensive in its range, of all the problems of the 
school, particularly when we extend the connotation 
of the word “discipline” to its largest terms. That 
which we call morale — the general discipline, spirit, 
and atmosphere of the school — is by far the most im- 
portant element in the school. We can conceive of a 
school without buildings, without equipment, without
-P-A-G-E-14
2 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
books; but we cannot conceive of a true school without 
morale. We are not to minimize the value of the ma- 
terial things contributing to the organization of the 
school, but the essential factor is this of pervading 
spirit.! 
Moral development. Even when we draw the lines 
that separate the various departments of the cur- 
riculum, it is the moral phase that gives the base 
for all the other subjects to rest upon. Not only this, 
but, in the words of Dr. Hall, “educators must face 
the fact that the ultimate verdict concerning the 
utility of the school will be determined ... by its 
moral efficiency in saving children from personal vice 
and crime.” 2 Indeed, the teachers of the United 
States, theoretically at least, have already faced the 
fact, inasmuch as the National Education Association, 
in its 1910 platform, asserts: “The fundamental con- 
sideration in any system of schools is the development 
of inflexible integrity and strong moral character in 
those receiving instruction. The Republic cannot sur- 
vive without a citizenship with high ideals of patriot- 
ism, duty, and service. This association, therefore, 
commends most heartily the growing interest in the 
moral development of the children of the nation.” 
1 As James Phirmey Munroe says, in New Demands in Educa- 
tion, (p. vii): “The fifth of the new demands is that education shall 
put its chief emphasis upon character: that the pupil shall be trained, 
in school and out of school, to-day and to-morrow, and all the time, 
toward self-reliance, self-control, self-respect, and self-denial.” 
2 G. Stanley Hall, Adolescence, vol. 1, p. 409.

INTRODUCTION 8 
ee problem, then, is not merely to determine how 
school control and obedience to school conventions 
shall be secured, but to discover the principles of moral 
development that condition these more specific vir- 
tues. ( 
The “case.” In the daily work of the classroom 
the teacher meets many “cases” of discipline, using 
the word “case” in the sense in which it is used by the 
physician in his field of practice. The teacher must 
properly relate these cases to the background of 
normal moral development, just as the medical expert 
studies the normal condition and development of the 
body. When the human body is in any way impaired, 
the physician is in the presence of a “case” and it is 
his duty to restore the patient to normal condition, 
if possible. Likewise, the teacher, dealing with the 
human mind and soul, frequently encounters cases 
of impairment of normal condition and development, 
and must be prepared, by a study of the pathology 
of mental and moral life, to treat them skillfully. 
There are at least two distinctly faulty methods 
of disposing of cases of either physical or moral dis- 
tress. The first is the hit-or-miss method, whereby 
one casts about aimlessly, trying first one remedy and 
then another, in the vague hope that some of them 
will reach the difficulty. *The second is the rule-of- 
thumb method by which one doses the patient with 
somebody’s specially prepared nostrum and awaits 
immediate results. But neither of these methods is
-P-A-G-E-16
4 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
, scientific. Neither will be followed by the intelligent 
physician or by the intelligent teacher. 
Educators, ‘as well as physicians, must be on their 
guard against the use of widely advertised cure-alls. 
The Medical Times, of New York, in July, 1912, 
seriously proposed that the various state legislatures 
pass laws making it a crime to assert publicly that 
a medicine will positively “cure” any disease, con- 
sidering such an assertion prima facie evidence of 
fraud. When this legislation is enacted let us hope 
that it will extend to the domain of the schools. Then 
will an innocent public be saved from the disastrous 
effects of accepting the alluring announcements of 
the educational quacks who would prescribe their 
specially exploited remedies as a guaranteed cure for 
all the ills of the schools. The problem of discipline, 
for example, will never be settled by any one “spe- 
cific,” such as the removal of adenoids or the applica- 
tion of So-and-So’s patented scheme of pupil self- 
government. 
Valid methods of procedure. The only valid method 
1 Annie Winsor Allen, Home, School, and Vacation, pp. 85, 116: 
“Tt is not true that pedagogy has been reduced to a science. In the 
nature of things, it cannot be other than a systematized series of 
suggestions, a condensed process of drawing attention to conspicu- 
ous facts and possibilities in mental training. Teaching is an art. 
No art can be taught by words or reduced to rules. It must be learned 
by instinct, perception, and practice. Educational theories are good 
as suggestion, not as prescription.” 
“Just as mental training cannot be included in a science, so, and 
much more, the problems of discipline cannot be solved by a sys- 
tem.”
-P-A-G-E-17
  ‘INTRODUCTION 5 
of procedure in the practice of teaching is that which is 
the only valid one in the practice of medicine. Each 
case must be studied upon its own merits, and in the 
light of scientific principles: that is, first, diagnosis; 
then, the application of fundamental truths with all 
the skill and intelligence at the command of the phy- 
sician, whether of the body or of the soul. 
This means that it is necessary for teachers to have 
at hand a body of fundamental general principles upon 
which they may freely draw when face to face with the 
individual case. For, in the words of Dr. Kirkpatrick, 
“The varieties of individuality are so great that psy- 
chology and child study can never tell teachers what 
they would most like to know — just how to deal with 
individual pupils.” ! The teacher must fall back upon 
foundation truths. 
“Of course, we cannot all the time see and do every- 
thing under the aspect of eternity and of absolute 
ends, but we can turn to the wider outlook and to the 
fundamental problems involved whenever we become 
perplexed and feel unsafe with regard to that which 
we are doing even in the narrowest circle.” ? It is a 
far cry from the protoplasmic cell to the boy in the 
class throwing spitballs; but the teacher who would 
adequately understand the boy must have some ac- 
‘quaintance with the cell, for out of ‘this has the boy 
developed.

  6 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
Frank discussion of “‘cases.” I realize that I have 
committed an educational fauz pas in so frankly refer- 
ring to a boy throwing a spitball in a class. For some 
inexplicable reason there has grown up the tradition 
that there is something of a stigma attached to ad- 
mitting that such incidents actually occur in the class- 
room. Perhaps it is due to the “polite” school of phi- 
losophers who have been reiterating for some years 
that such occurrences ought not to be. But, after all, 
why should teachers exhibit diffidence in discussing 
the symptoms of moral disease? The members of the 
medical profession do not hesitate to refer to the 
details of physical disease. The physician brings to 
the attention of his professional fellows, and discusses 
freely with them, some rather disagreeable expressions 
of the human body. Shall teachers have any greater 
hesitancy in discussing, in a technical and professional 
spirit, the disagreeable manifestations of the human 
soul? 
An abscess is not a pretty thing; neither is a boy 
who tells his teacher to go to hell. The one is a physi- 
cal condition offensive to our physical sense; the other 
denotes a moral condition offensive to our moral sense. 
But the doctor operates intelligently in the case of 
bodily abnormality, and frankly discusses his methods. 
Shall not the teacher similarly treat his cases of moral 
abnormality, and discuss them with equal sincerity? It 
iscertain that the world has not seen its last abscess — 
there will be in the future many cases requiring treat-
-P-A-G-E-19
INTRODUCTION n 
ment; nor has the world seen its last case of a de- 
fiant, foul-mouthed pupil. This statement does not 
imply that the children of our schools generally are 
ill-behaved — any more than it implies that every 
adult is afflicted with an abscess. 
Order of procedure. We have, then, to consider the 
problems of discipline in the light of broad funda- 
mental principles. We shall endeavor to determine 
these principles and then to apply them to typical 
cases. The problems group themselves, naturally, 
into those concerned (1) with the individual; (2) with 
the class; and (3) with the school; and in this order 
we approach them. —

CHAPTER I ? 
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CONDUCT 4 
The individual in the class. Under present-day 
conditions the teacher must, of necessity, perform 
much of her ! service to her pupils by means of exer- 
, cises directed toward the class as a whole. Teaching 
children en masse has its advantages. It affords op- 
portunity to economize in management. Moreover, a 
distinct benefit accrues to the individual from the 
social phase of the educative process. For, although 
the large class is justly criticized, it by no means fol- 
lows that, if we agree that a class of thirty is better 
than one of sixty, equally is a class of fifteen better 
than one of thirty. But the large class also has its 
disadvantages. Chief among them is the danger that 
the teacher may lose sight of the individual in the 
mass work. Whatever the size of the class, it is the 
individual that is the inevitable unit to which all cal- 
culations i in school management must be reduced. 
Hence{ to gain skill in discipline, the class teacher 
1 The author’s explanation of his use of pronouns, made in another 
of his educational books, is here repeated: “Throughout the book 
I refer, for the sake of clearness, to the principal as he and to the 
teacher as she, though I am not unmindful that there are many 
women principals and many men teachers in our schools. The 
reader will please not take exception to the arbitrary selection of 
pronouns, but accept it as a simple means to a desirable end.” oe
-P-A-G-E-24
12 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
must start with a substantial basis of doctrine con- 
cerning moral action on the part of the individual 
boy or girl. It is possibly less important that she 
have one particular theory as compared with another 
than that she have some theory, for here, as always 
in educational doctrine, we must guard against dog- 
matism. It is, indeed, in a spirit of reservation that 
the matter is presented in these pages. Some elemen- 
tary psychology of the mind in moral action is indis- 
pensable. As our need is for the very simplest possible 
psychology that can give us light and leading, it is 
aimed to avoid elusive speculative distinctions and to 
rest upon the most elementary truths. 
Action and morality. Life is action. Nothing that is 
incapable of action can be charged with immorality. 
Only in action, positive or negative, can there be 
morality. But action, of itself, does not necessitate 
morality. We do not think of the wind or of brute 
animals as subject to a code of morals. Even the 
conduct of a child may have no moral significance. 
Although his act may have some consequence harm- 
ful either to himself or to others, he is not yet capa- 
ble of realizing it. The obligation is therefore upon us, 
his guides, to cause him to conduct himself rightly, 
for his own and others’ sake. Likewise, it is both to his 
interest and to ours that he be trained for the time 
when his conduct does become a moral issue to him. 
Thus he will eventually take over to himself the respon- 
sibility for making that conduct right and not wrong.
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CONDUCT 13 
Sensation and reason. The development of the 
sense of moral obligation depends upon the develop- 
ment of reason. Sensation is the basis of conscious 
life; without it, of course, we have no life as we under- 
stand it. The lowest form of consciousness is mere 
automatic response to stimulus. Sensations of pleas- 
ure and pain, of like and dislike, become differentiated. 
In the lower forms of consciousness the individual 
acts as he likes: that is, if he can, he does that which 
yields pleasure and avoids that which yields pain. 
But we of the human species, endowed with reason, 
frequently reverse this procedure—on occasion we de- 
liberately do the painful in preference to the pleasur- 
able, or the less desirable in place of the more desirable. 
Mere sensational life, for example, would never take 
us to the dentist’s; only reason, holding before us a 
distant gain, can compel us to submit to the buzz and 
grind of the drill. Doing the moral thing, then, is 
putting reason in command of the senses. 
Intellect, feeling, and will. In order to understand 
how reason gains command over sense desire, let us 
analyze conduct. We fall back upon three well-worn 
' words, — intellect, feeling, and will, — but we must 
be careful as to how we employ them. The’old psy- 
chology talked of them as constituting three faculties 
of the mind, with the implication that each might be 
taken away from the others and exhibited by itself. 
But we realize that, instead, they are inextricably 
intertwined in such a way that any and every moment 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
14 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
of consciousness is a cross-section in which all three 
are present. We use the terms, then, as indicating 
three phases of conscious life. It is true that at times 
one of them may be stressed more than the other two: 
a person may be in the attitude of close intellectual at- 
tention, or he may give way to an outburst of feeling, 
or he may exhibit a determination that seems sheer 
will power. But in ultimate analysis no one of these 
attributes stands alone. 
As all three of these factors are involved in action, 
we must take all of them into account when we esti- 
mate action as to its moral value. Conduct — action 
with moral color — is the expression of will moved 
by feeling! and modified or instructed by intellect. 
All three must operate favorably in order to produce 
right conduct. If any one of the factors throws its 
weight toward the wrong effect, the resultant action 
will be wrong. 
Aconcrete case. Let us consider a single, homely 
illustration. It is a tempestuous, snow-swept evening. 
Arriving home at the close of your day’s work, be- 
draggled and weary, you brighten up with fresh cloth- 
ing and ahearty meal. Then you settle yourself 
1 In most of our discussion, reference is to that particular phase 
of feeling called emotion — feeling related to, or concerned with, 
some object. The emotions, fear and jealousy, for example, require 
an object — one must fear something or some one, one must be 
jealous of some one. Nevertheless, mere sense-feelings, phases of 
unpleasantness, personal discomfort, etc., are not unrelated to 
conduct. Hence, the broad term “feeling” is used in preference 
to any of its more specific forms.

before the cheerful fire, and turn the leaves of the 
thrilling romance to the place where you left off at the 
last sitting. All your senses are at ease. A feeling of 
physical and mental contentment pervades. Suddenly 
there flashes across your mind the thought of your 
friend who is ill — you promised to visit her at your 
first opportunity. Will you go? Intellect reviews the 
abstract elements of the problem in order to answer 
the merely intellectual question: Ought I to go? Feel- 
ing, thus advised, gets behind the right or wrong 
judgment. Will obeys or disobeys the mandate of 
feeling. Intellect may, in all sincerity, argue that it is 
best for your friend that you do not go — her worry 
over your coming out in the storm would outweigh 
any cheer which you might bring her. If, however, 
intellect renders the verdict that you ought to go, 
then it becomes immoral for you not to go. But the 
mere rendering of this judgment — an abstract state- 
ment like a mathematical proposition — cannot alone 
result in the right action. If feeling pushes it aside 
with a “What-do-I-care?”’ the action fails. Also, even 
if feeling glows.warm with duty, there is yet the will 
to reckon with. Will may meet all with a helpless 
yielding to the drowsy “This is so comfortable.” Only 
when the command of the instructed feeling meets 
with prompt obedience by the will can effective action 
ensue. oe 
“TE is not to be assumed, because analysis has been 
pushed to some length in this illustration, that our
-P-A-G-E-28
16 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
mind operates thus consciously and systematically in 
all our actions. But undoubtedly the elements do thus 
factor in all conduct, even though so momentarily as 
to be lost to casual analysis. 
Analysis and diagnosis. Teachers, concerned with 
nourishing moral growth and treating moral patho- 
logy, must habitually bring this analysis to bear in the 
diagnosis of the moral acts of those for whose care they 
are responsible. Certainly they cannot proceed suc- 
cessfully if they inaccurately diagnose a case. How 
futile for them to treat the will, for example, when the 
fault actually is with an intellect that is improperly 
instructing an otherwise efficient will. They must be 
ever mindful of Coloncl Parker’s injunction: “‘Remem- 
ber that the whole boy goes to school.” In doing so, 
they will not hammer away at any one element of the 
boy’s personality in an effort to remodel the whole of 
him. 
It is evident that the problem of discipline is con- 
cerned with all three of the factors that enter into con- 
duct. Therefore we must direct our efforts toward 
training each factor to do its part in the multitude of 
actions which in their totality constitute moral life.
-P-A-G-E-29
CHAPTER II 
INTELLECT 
Accurate judgment a growth. Complete and correct 
functioning of the intellect factor is necessary to right 
conduct. In order that the expression of ourselves 
in action may be moral, our intellect must judge cor- 
rectly as to the distinction between right and wrong. 
Accurate judgment, in any department of life, is gained 
only through growth. Growth depends upon experi- 
ence and training. We do not expect the two-year-old 
to reason incisively as to mathematical relationships, 
—we have no greater right to expect him to reason 
cogently as to moral relationships. We can no more 
demand that he judge infallibly as to moral standards 
than that he work out a problem in an indirect case of 
percentage. We wait until a child is well along in years 
before we ask him to solve indirect problems in per- 
centage, but we frequently act as though he ought, at 
an early age, to solve indirect problems in morals. 
The intellect, then, as the regulating gévernor of 
‘the moral machine, must be brought to a constantly 
increasing state of reliability. The child must become 
acquainted with the accepted standards of right. 
These he may learn, to a certain degree, as the result 
of formal instruction. But he gains them chiefly 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
18 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM ' 
through a long series of experiences in rendering judg- 
ments upon the various situations that arise in his 
own life and in the lives of others. 
Thus it happens that teachers, and others charged 
with the duty of placing moral values before children, 
stand before them not only as instructors but also as 
patterns. In either capacity they are in danger of 
failing in two directions: they may set forth standards 
that are (1) false and arbitrary, or (2) beyond the 
comprehension of the child-mind. 
False standards. Only too frequently are false 
standards imposed upon children. For example, 
cleanliness is a very desirable virtue. Yet “the divine 
right to be gloriously dirty a large portion of the time, 
when dirt is a necessary consequence of direct, useful, 
friendly contact with all sorts of interesting, helpful 
things, is too clear to be denied.” ! Nevertheless, 
many a mother sets up an unnatural standard of con- 
stant cleanliness, imposes rules to secure compliance 
with this standard, and then reproves her child for the 
slightest infraction of these rules. In satisfying her 
own pride, she fails to recognize proportionate values. 
We impose false standards, too, when our criterion 
of children’s conduct is merely “How does it affect 
us?” If their actions annoy or disturb or irritate us, 
we condemn them as wrong. On the contrary, if we 
are left undisturbed, we are prone to overlook real 
misconduct. Thus the feeling that prompts the mother 
1 Kate Douglas Wiggin, Children’s Rights, p. 13.
-P-A-G-E-31
INTELLECT 19 
to punish her boy for getting dirty may be merely 
annoyance that the clothes must be washed. In 
starching and ruffling the child for her own gratifica- 
tion, she may be deemed more culpable than the boy, 
who is but following his natural affinity for dirt. This 
does not mean that the child is to be freely permitted 
to do things annoying and irritating to others, — the 
fact that an act is a source of annoyance to others is 
ordinarily sufficient to make it a wrong act. As has 
been well said: “A child should not have his own 
way, but he should have the way of a child.” 
Mature standards. Teachers and parents often 
misguide children by imposing standards beyond the 
ability of the child to comprehend. It is hard, for in- 
stance, to explain to him the validity of the “social” 
or “white”’ lie. Indeed, even for the average adult, 
many moral distinctions are too finely drawn — “split- 
ting hairs already split.” Again, the abstractions,— 
toleration, honor, charity, truth, and the others — 
mean little to the child. “When I was a child,” says 
Paul, “I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I 
thought as a child.” We must be sure to leave to the 
child his childish things and childish thoughts. 
Standards beyond the child’s understanding. One 
precaution teachers and parents must constantly 
observe. Before they judge a child’s act as one of 
wrongdoing, they must make sure that he really appre- 
hended even what appeared to be easily understood 
requirements. Physical defect may hamper the child 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
20 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
in learning exactly what is required of him. What 
seems a case of misconduct on the part of a pupil may 
sometimes be due to the fact that he did not hear the 
command given him, or see the gesture, or the direc- 
tions written on the blackboard. Even in dealing with 
the child who is unquestionably sense-whole and capa- 
ble of giving attention to commands, constant caution 
must be exercised so that we may be certain that he 
understands the standard set before him. 
It is easy for an alert boy to misunderstand even in 
receiving apparently clear orders. In the home, for 
example, how frequently do you call to John from 
down-stairs, “Bring me my umbrella and overshoes, 
John,” and all John gets of the command is the termi- 
nal “overshoes, John.” When he has honestly obeyed 
the command as his mind received it and appears with 
the overshoes, he is met with reproof for not having 
executed all of the commission. “John” should be the 
introduction; then, attention gained, the order fol- 
lows. Many cases of school discipline may be traced 
to incomplete commands or ambiguous orders. For 
instance, “‘Go to the office” may mean to any one of 
four offices; “Do what I told you” may mean any one 
of ten things “told” you; “Put papers away” may 
mean certain papers, or others, or all of them; and so 
on. 
The intellect, then, must be deliberately trained in 
order that one may grow strong in moral vision. In 
one sense the training of the intellect has been ne-
-P-A-G-E-33
  INTELLECT 21 
glected. We say to the eight-year-old, “Why, you 
ought to have known that you should n’t bite Bessie 
when she kicked you”; and how, pray, should he 
know that? We frequently take for granted that a 
child has attained a mental stature able to grasp moral 
values, though we know well that he has not attained 
any like ability to grasp values along other intellectual 
lines. 
Intellect and right action. On the other hand, the 
force of the intellect factor in determining moral con- 
duct is frequently overestimated. We often train it 
to the exclusion of the other two phases, and then ex- 
pect moral perfection to ensue. Ethics is the intellect- 
ual side only. It is talking; not doing. We make a sad 
mistake when we think that in talking we have done 
all that is to be done. Fathers, mothers, teachers fail 
to understand why a boy does a wrong thing when he 
has been repeatedly told not to doit. There is nothing 
incomprehensible about it, when we recognize the 
important part played in conduct by feeling and will. 
Millions of people from time immemorial have given 
utterance to intellectual statements as to what con- 
stitutes right conduct. There has been no lack of 
ereeds. A religious creed has its uses, but it is not 
morals. Nevertheless, people have ever been in danger 
of substituting creed for conduct, form for spirit. 
With all our respect for intellect we must realize how 
impotent to secure right action is intellectual judg- 
ment alone, unsupported by feeling and will.
-P-A-G-E-34
  CHAPTER III 
FEELING 
Motive power of feeling. The motive power behind 
the will in action is not intellect but feeling. Intellect 
is cold and analytic; feeling, especially in its emotions 
(ex, out; movere, to move), is warm and impulsive. 
From the earliest automatic reactions of pain and 
pleasure to the highest sentiment of duty, the push 
and throb of conduct is from the keen and vivid life 
of feeling. Feeling ranges through a long series of 
phases from mere sense-likes and sense-dislikes up 
through the various emotions to “‘that consciousness 
of an internal power superior to all other powers,” 
which we call duty. 
We hear much about good motives and bad motives, 
primary and secondary, natural and artificial; but we 
are concerned first of all with securing some motive 
that is effective for right conduct. We may agree with 
Miss Smith, that “there is one true and final motive 
to good conduct, and that is a hunger in the soul of 
man for the blessing of the spirit, a ceaseless longing 
to be in perfect harmony with the principles of ever- 
lasting and eternal right.” ! But it does not follow 
that if we cannot engage this “true and final motive” 
1 Kate Douglas Wiggin, Children’s Rights, p. 168.
-P-A-G-E-35
  
FEELING 23 
to our service, we should abandon the effort to secure 
right conduct. Habits of right conduct must be de- 
veloped, and this can be done only through the opera-. 
tion of some motive. And any motive is better than 
none. 
Tingeing intellect with emotion. Mere intellectual 
statements of desirable habits or of desirable ideals 
never bring them to pass. 
The moment that the intelligence has to struggle alone, 
without any outside help, against the brutal array of sensual 
forces, it is reduced to helplessness. 
It is necessary, therefore, if we would weld an idea solidly 
and indestructibly to a desired action,’ that we should fuse 
them together by the heat of an emotion. 
The will is not fond of carrying out the cold orders it 
receives from the intelligence. As it is the organ of all power 
and feeling, it wants emotional orders tinged with passion.? 
Thus the chief work of the moral culturist in the 
training of feeling is to develop a series of motives of 
successively higher and higher order. The individual 
passes through the entire range from sense-pleasure 
and sense-pain, through fear, anger, pity, love, altru- 
ism, and the others, to the abstract concept of duty. 
We cannot declare offhand that one motive is “higher” 
or “better” than another. There are times and oc- 
casions when an incentive generally held to be not 
altogether praiseworthy may at the moment be just 
the one to operate favorably. 
Effective lower motives. Fear, for instance, is not 
1 Payot, Education of the Will, pp. 55, 77, 100.  
-P-A-G-E-36
  % DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
ordinarily rated as a high motive; yet undeniably it 
has its uses. It leads us, very fortunately, to go out 
of a building by the stairway rather than by the win- 
dow. In the home, love should have its sway; yet an 
element of fear is not without its place even there, for 
it is the beginning of the recognition of authority. It 
is the parent who is responsible for the child’s welfare. 
He is legally accountable for the proper and adequate 
protection of his child. To this end he must establish 
in the child habits of obedience. At times he may have 
to resort to the fear motive. Authority and the moral 
value of subjecting one’s self to authority are facts 
in the world, and it is well for the child to meet these 
facts early in his experience. 
Anger is another expression of feeling that is not 
usually to be regarded as a high motive. But anger 
may be put behind a moral purpose, such as scourging 
the money-changers. Even though, at times, one may 
lose himself in a storm of emotional experience, one 
still has intellect and will by which to save the day. 
Anger is of especial value when it is directed against 
one’s self. 
We must, then, guard against accepting any such 
sweeping dictum as “The teacher should control by 
love and not by fear.” We grant that, to the onlooker, 
a class working on the impetus of how they love their 
teacher is somewhat prettier than one impelled by fear 
of the teacher. But aside from this esthetic considera- 
tion it would seem that the pupils are not much nearer
-P-A-G-E-37
  FEELING 25 
the high ideal of doing right for right’s sake in the one 
case than in the other. In either instance the motive 
originates from without, and not from within. 
Another point is to be noted. The higher grades of 
motives are developed from those of lower grade. But 
when we say that the individual passes from one 
motive to another, we do not mean that he abandons 
the lower motive in favor of the higher. However 
lofty may be the ideals that dominate his habitual 
conduct, there are yet occasions when his acts are 
governed by motives lower in the scale. 
The kindergarten and feeling. It is in the cultiva- 
tion of fine feeling that the kindergarten, rightly and 
sanely construed, makes its prime contribution to the 
work of moral development. Little of the kindergarten 
method should be carried beyond the kindergarten 
age; but the kindergarten spirit may continue to 
foster ideals throughout the grades. 
Chief among these ideals is that of social comity. 
No child can have genuine social life within the family 
circle. However outspreading the household, it cannot 
supply him with a social group of sufficiently large 
proportions. For, to be effective as a social entity, 
the group must comprise children of approximately the 
same age. The eight-year-old must play with the 
eight-year-old to get true companionship. He will 
patronize the five-year-old, will take care of him, but 
will not play with him in the true sense. Girls partic- 
ularly accept younger girls not as playmates, but as 
playthings.
-P-A-G-E-38
26 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
Of course, the child attains a certain type of respect 
for his elders, but it is not at all the kind that he learns 
— and for successful living must learn — for his peers. 
It is only as he travels outside the province of the 
family that he gains true and complete ideals of the 
social virtues. In the kindergarten, he comes face to 
face with social conditions and learns something of 
social justice.! In the daily intercourse of this micro- 
cosm, he gradually senses the social ideals and to the 
limit of his capacity gains an appreciation of them. 
Kindness, cheerfulness, industry, codperation, all feed 
his emotional hunger; and it is important that he be 
fed on these rather than on the upshoots of an un- 
regulated environment. 
Religion and conduct. It is on the feeling side, too, 
that religion most properly finds its place in the psy- 
chology of conduct. To be religious does not mean to 
do the right invariably; it means, rather, to avail 
one’s self of a peculiarly high impulse toward the 
strengthening of ideals. Religion, it is true, has its 
intellect side: — its dogma, its creeds, its command- 
ments, its theology. Religion has its will side: — its 
regimen, its penance, its formal duties. But religion 
itself is preéminently a motive power, a thing of the 
spirit for the life of the spirit, the seed of lofty emotions 
fruiting in moral actions. It is an influence nourishing 
1 As Mrs. Bryant, in Moral Instruction and Training in Schools, 
says (p. 49): “To substitute WE for I is a gain in moral capacity 
even if not in actual morality. And all experience of school life 
shows how natural it is and how delightful to the average child 
to live the corporate life and grow by means of it.”
-P-A-G-E-39
  FEELING Q7 
the spiritual life, making sweet the desire to follow the 
symbol of duty. 
Which particular form religion shall take for each 
individual is a matter of temperament and taste. 
“There is no disputing over tastes,” runs the proverb. 
Nor can there be any disputing over religion. There 
never has been any dispute over religion. All the sad 
history of religious agitation and religious war has 
touched only the politics and theology of the institu- 
tion, not the thing itself, the essential life of the spirit. 
If my religion is not your religion, I cannot make it so. 
Any form of religion either nourishes you or it does not 
nourish you. If it does not, then it is not religion for 
you. If it nourishes me and does not nourish you, this 
fact is not a subject for debate or argument. 
There is a lesson here for teachers. They cannot 
ignore the religious life of their pupils. That is not to 
say that they must become teachers of religious doc- 
trine. But they are unscientific if they are indifferent 
to the religious experience of their pupils and neglect 
to allow for it in their diagnosis and treatment of 
eases. Religion, of course, cannot be used formally in 
the public classroom. We must not indicate religious 
prejudice or even preference. But there are moments 
of sacred intimate conference with the individual pupil 
when the aid of religious experience may be invoked 
on behalf of right conduct. The appeal must invari- 
ably be made to the pupil’s own religion within him 
and never be based upon the dogma of the teacher. SN
-P-A-G-E-40
CHAPTER IV 
WILL 
Will a dynamic force. The direct agent of the indi- 
vidual in his conduct is his will. Perhaps, by penetrat- 
ing analysis, we may even follow the philosophers who 
say that the individual is will. However accurate the 
individual’s intellectual judgment on moral issues, 
however fervid his passion for right doing, his good 
intent burns itself out unless there is sturdiness of will 
to make the thought and desire real in action. Intel- 
lect is cold and static; feeling is warm and impulsive; 
but will is the real persistent dynamic force. The 
strength of the ego is expressed in will; intellect and 
feeling are but form and color. 
The will, we perceive, is the measure of power. It 
is the most precious possession of the individual. 
Hence it should be nourished and not “broken.” 
Much too much of discipline in home and in school is 
directed toward the breaking of the will. An individ- 
ual is not truly disciplined when he is merely rendered 
“artificially silent as a mute, and immovable as a 
paralytic.” 
The strong will. Often, in dramatic exhibitions of 
misconduct, we are so impressed by the stupendous 
force of the will that we make the mistake of regarding
-P-A-G-E-41
  
WILL 29 
the will itself as the primal cause of the misconduct. 
Strong will and crime are not strictly cause and effect. 
The rifle is not the cause of the murder; the drill is 
not the cause of the burglary; the pen is not the cause 
of the forgery. No one would hope to abolish murder, 
burglary, and forgery by destroying the gun, the drill, 
and the pen. Nor can we hope to abolish misconduct 
by destroying the will. Moreover, it is this very will 
that is needed for the work of the world and the prog- 
ress of the race. The rifle may free the slave, the drill 
may build a railroad, the pen may rubricate an epic; 
and the will may reflect divinity. 
The high-class burglar may be, in his way, an in- 
spiring exponent of will. I do not refer to the sneaking 
thief who prowls from weakness and not from strength, 
but to the daring burglar high in his profession. His 
is an exploit of nerve and courage. His weakness is 
not of the will, but of intellect and feeling. There is a 
twist in his mental vision, a slant in his emotional life, 
perverting his will from moral paths. Society, to 
protect itself from his depredations, imposes its will 
upon his, and, when it can catch him, forces him into 
submission. This is for the public good. But his 
growth, as is seen if attention be focused upon him, 
is to be gained not by the restraint enforced upon him, 
but by the instruction of his intellect and the develop- 
ment of his feeling so that the forceful will may be 
turned into the service of worthy things. 
Similarly in our work with children, we must ever
-P-A-G-E-42
30 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
be ready to evaluate willful misconduct for what it 
is, namely, a wrong expression of a strong will. Qur 
whole aim should be so to strengthen the other two 
factors that the will learns to serve straight thinking 
and high ideals. 
The weak will. Quite different is the problem of 
weak will. Consider the thief who knows that he ought 
to be honest and who feels the duty of honesty. But 
to be honest means to be thrifty and industrious. 
Industry means struggle. There is open an easier path 
along which the material fruits of honesty may be 
plucked. To steal is easier than not to steal. Intellect 
says: “Thou shalt not steal.” Feeling desires to obey 
the commandments. But hunger opposes, and the will 
yields. 
So, too, in the schoolroom, much misconduct is due 
to weak wills. The boy comes to school aglow with the 
impulse to do right, and accurate in his judgment as 
to what is the right; yet, under pressure of circum- 
stance, his will weakens and his good intentions are 
swept aside. 
Training the will. The will, like its associates, intel- 
lect and feeling, must needs be trained. Schopenhauer 
tells us that we are but one third intellect and two 
thirds will. Yet how neglected has been the training 
of the will. In the language of Payot, “Is it not dis- 
couraging to think that the most important thing, 
the education of the will, is nowhere directly and 
consciously taught . . . and yet, is it not through
-P-A-G-E-43
WILL 31 
his energy alone that a man is able to round out his 
ite?” * 
By way of caution, we must note that in securing 
obedience we do not necessarily train the will. “Blind 
obedience to authority is not in itself moral. It is 
necessary in order that we may save children dangers 
of which they know nothing. It is valuable also as a 
habit.” ? So, all cases of “‘making”’ a pupil do a thing 
through physical compulsion are practically valueless 
for will training. 
For example, the teacher orders a pupil to leave the 
classroom and report himself to the principal. He 
refuses. The teacher appeals to the principal. The 
principal comes, and forcibly ejects the boy. It is clear 
that in this act the boy’s will receives no training. 
Order is restored, obedience is secured, society is 
vindicated; but nothing is done either to weaken or 
to strengthen the boy’s will. All this is aside from the 
question as to the wisdom of the procedure. It may 
be wise or it may not — discussion of this phase of the 
case must be postponed until we have considered other 
important principles. It is sufficient here to emphasize 
the fact that, wise or unwise, this disposition of the 
case is almost entirely unrelated to the development 
of the boy’s will. “Almost,” because it is conceivable 
that persistent and repeated thwarting of the will 
may do physical damage, breaking down the nerve-

-P-A-G-E-44
  82 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
centers of control and thus actually vitiating the 
will. 
How, then, may will be trained and nourished? It 
must be confessed that neither experience nor the 
laboratory has given us entirely adequate laws con- 
cerning will development. It is a great field, ready for 
tillage, and the harvest is greatly needed. Fortunately, 
however, there are a few principles at hand upon which 
to build in training will in ourselves or in others. 
Physical vitality and will. First, the physical basis 
of self-control must be recognized. The will is weak- 
ened by low bodily tone. Inherited tendencies to 
special weakness, disease, and unfavorable conditions 
of environment all factor. Frequently the weakening 
causes may be removed; hence we should ever be on 
the alert to discover such causes with a view to their 
elimination. Irritating growths, malnutrition, loss of 
sleep, all put a distinct strain upon the will. 
This group of causes is constantly overlooked in 
school work. It is forgotten that misconduct may be 
due to a will weakened by causes that do not appear. 
To mention such an event as a boil usually excites a 
certain amount of amusement, — but that is when the 
boil is on the other fellow. On one’s self it rises to the 
dignity of a powerful enemy of the will. Many of 
the ills that flesh is heir to may, unknown to the 
careless observation of the teacher, operate from time 
to time-to make her pupils subnormal as to will 
strength. She must not be too hasty, therefore, to 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  
WILL 33 
characterize as willful misconduct the actions of the 
child until she knows that his body has been properly 
fed, his nerves calmed in sleep, and that he is not in 
the early stages of some distressing disease. 
Even the seasonal and daily weather changes have 
their influence upon the will, as every one, and partic- 
ularly teachers, can testify. Dexter claims that “the 
deportment of the pupils is at its best during cold, 
calm, and clear weather — at its worst during that 
characterized as hot and muggy. The opinion is also 
expressed that boys are affected more than girls.” 1 
The intellect and the will. Second, the intellect may 
be brought to bear upon will training. Intellect can 
put before us the value of struggle. To the boy we may 
say, “Put your will to better use. You are putting 
your good strong fourteen-year-old will to doing only 
1 Edwin Grant Dexter, Weather Influences, p. 140. Certain other 
statements, of significance to teachers, are: — 
“The quality of the emotional state is plainly influenced by the 
weather states.” 
“Although meteorological conditions affect the emotional states, 
which without doubt have weight in the determination of conduct 
in its broadest sense, it would seem that their effects upon that 
portion of the reserve energy which is available for action are of 
the greatest import.” 
“Those meteorological conditions which are productive of mis- 
conduct in a broad sense of the word, are also productive of health, 
and mental alertness; as a corollary, misconduct is the result of an 
excess of reserve energy, not directed to some useful purpose.” 
(Page 270.) 
“And with the school child; have we not here an argument for 
more work? — not mental work, but good, solid, healthful manual 
labor or athletics, for of the intellectual sort we have enough al- 
ready.” (Page 277.)
-P-A-G-E-46
  34 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
eight-year-old things.” Even young children appre- 
ciate the force of this and put conscious effort into will 
exercise. We recall the story of the little girl who, 
while her mother was apparently asleep, tiptoed into 
the room and up to a dish of fruit. Hesitating but a 
moment, she deftly purloined an orange. Her mother 
chose not to betray the fact that she was awake, and 
awaited developments. In the course of a few minutes, 
the little one again cautiously entered the room, 
orange in hand. Again she tiptoed to the dish, this 
time replacing the orange. As she turned away she 
exclaimed, “There, that’s the time you got left, Mr. 
Devil!” 
“No wound,” says Arnold Bennett, “is more cruel 
to the spirit of resolve than that dealt by failure.” 
But intellect may step in to convince us that failure 
is never inevitable, that failure may be overcome, 
that not even at seventy times seven times are we to 
give up hope of ultimate success. Intellect presents 
to us, too, the essential doctrine of training, namely, 
— We learn to do by doing. We see that each defeat 
of will, discouraging as it is, may yet be counteracted 
by the successes of will. Best of all, it teaches us that 
we should not wait for defeat before deliberately work- 
ing to strengthen the will. Professor James has given 
us the prescription: Give the will daily a little grat- 
uitous exercise. 
Often, it is the failure to use this prescription in the 
class that makes possible the conflict of wills between
-P-A-G-E-47
  WILL 85 
teacher and pupil. The teacher waits until some 
large and important issue of school conduct arises and 
then, for the first time, seeks to hammer the will. 
Yet there are daily opportunities to put problems in 
will exercise before the weak-willed individuals in the 
class. These exercises should be of such a character 
that they are possible of accomplishment, but are, in 
their consequences, so unimportant that, if the pupil 
fails, his failure may be overlooked as a matter of 
“discipline.” Under such a course of will exercise, the 
pupil slowly but surely grows in ability to match his 
will against issues more and more powerful. 
Feeling and the will. Third, and finally, feeling may 
be brought to bear upon will training. 
If a person prefers the grandeur of a Socrates, a Regulus, 
or a Vincent de Paul to the ignoble depravity of the most 
repulsive specimens of the human species, such a preference, 
no matter how feeble it may be, is quite sufficient. For to 
prefer implies love and desire. This desire, no matter how 
fleeting it may be, can be held and protected. It will grow 
strong if it is cultivated, and will, through the skillfully 
managed interplay of the laws of psychology, be transformed 
into a virile resolution. 
There are two main directions in which feeling may 
be drawn upon to aid will; through shift of ideals and 
through encouragement. The former is indirect; the 
latter, direct. In the one case we replace the ineffec- 
tive ideal held by the child with one that has a more 
powerful interest for him and hence a more powerful 
1 Payot, Education of the Will, p. 47.
-P-A-G-E-48
  36 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
hold upon him. This new ideal is able to govern his 
will and thus he gets the exercise which adds its iota 
to the total of his will-training.’ 
Encouragement in will training. In the other case, 
through the force of our own personality, we act 
directly upon the pupil’s will without invoking the 
mediation of another ideal. This means encourage- 
ment and sympathy. To say to a child, “I knew you 
could n’t do it,”, is unquestionably weakening. To 
say with conviction, “I am sure you will do it next 
time,” is enheartening and strengthening. 
The teacher may gain a point from the story of the 
noted horse-trainer who gave as the chief reason for 
his success: — 
I never send a horse back to his stall discouraged. If it is 
the high jump, for instance, I set the height, say, at six feet. 
The horse clears it handily. I set it at six-two, at six-four, 
and so on, until at six-ten he fails. He fails again and again. 
But this is not the time to end the lesson. I put the bar back 
at six-eight. He jumps this, and undisheartened, he com- 
pletes the day’s exercise. The next time I bring him out, 
with the memory of victory in his mind, he is eager to go at 
the task. 
Guyau sums it up thus: — 
All education, indeed, should be directed to this end, to 
convince the child that he is capable of good and incapable of 
1 However, E. A. Kirkpatrick, Fundamentals of Child Study, p. 
195 says: “Care must be taken not to interfere with freedom of choice 
[of moral ideals] by exhortation and urging; for in their very nature 
ideals must be freely chosen by the individual because they appeal 
to something within him, and not because somebody else finds them 
good,”

  WILL 37 
evil, in order to render him actually so; to persuade him that 
he has a strong will, in order to give him strength of will; 
to make him believe that he is morally free and master of 
himself, in order that the idea of moral liberty may tend 
to progressively realize itself.1 
One of the strongest aids to encouragement is sympa- 
thy. If we, as teachers, would but get off the pedestal 
that the pedantic traditions have set up for us and 
come down and live with our children on the same 
level, how great would be the gain. If we could but 
convince our children of our humanity, of our oneness 
with them in every human attribute; if they could but 
know that we too aspire, struggle, stumble, lose and 
gain, fear and hope, how limitless would be our in- 
fluence. And we can strive for this relation with our 
pupils, and attain it, without loss of dignity, without 
loss of authority. Then we can say to our weak-willed 
boy, “Yes, I know.” And we can say it so sincerely 
and amplify it so consistently that he feels the throb 
of sympathy, and his responding heart beats true to 
a renewed courage.

  CHAPTER V 
MORAL DEVELOPMENT 
Normal vs. abnormal. The first step in the analysis 
of a case of discipline is to determine whether it is 
intellect, feeling, or will that is misfunctioning. Hence 
the principles which underlie the growth of these three 
factors now merit discussion, so that what is normal 
in growth may be properly understood and distin- 
guished from what is abnormal. Only by an under- 
standing of the normal can a correct evaluation of 
conduct be made; and, furthermore, only through this 
understanding can the abnormal be diagnosed. 
To analyze the present, we must understand the 
past. From the past, we learn the explanation of the 
phenomenon of individuality. Fill a room with pig 
iron and we can control it by the simplest of physical 
laws. We can manipulate it with absolute surety of 
result. We can, for instance, convert it into a thousand 
hammer-heads of uniform consistency, weight, and 
form. Fill a room with boys and girls, and we can 
control them only by acting in accord with the most 
complicated physical and psychical laws. Never can 
we prophesy the ultimate result of our efforts to mould 
them. Never can we run them into fifty replicas of 
any individual model.
-P-A-G-E-51
MORAL DEVELOPMENT 39 
Individuality and evolution. The explanation of 
individuality lies deep in the history of the race. The 
hypothesis of evolution tells us that the present is 
derived from a limitless past. Organic life goes back 
to the days when all life was unicellular. Gradually 
through the ages the single cells grouped into twos, 
into threes, into fours, and so on, and divergent 
organic forms developed in bewildering succession. 
Thus, to-day, plants and animals exist to virtually an 
infinite variety. In a word, the various types of pres- 
ent-day living organisms, including man, were not 
created each by itself, but have evolved in the march 
of time through successive changes in preéxistent 
types. 
Evolution has been a matter of the development 
not only of physical structure, but equally of mental 
life. In the language of Doncaster, “The conclusion 
is therefore reached that not only bodily characters, 
but also those of the mind are essentially determined 
by the hereditary endowment received from the par- 
ents.”* Each unit organism, now as throughout the 
eeons of the past, is acted upon by all the forces of the 
world outside itself. This action brings about a cor- 
responding reaction from the organism. The reactive 
tendency is known as “tropism.” Tropisms are clas- 
sified according to the kinds of stimulus involved. 
Among them are: heliotropism (or phototropism), 
reaction to light; thermotropism, reaction to heat; 
1 L. Doncaster, Heredity in the Light of Recent Research, p. 49.
-P-A-G-E-52
  40 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
thigniotropism, reaction to contact; chemotropism, 
reaction to chemicals. Tropisms may be either to- 
ward or away from the stimulus. 
These forces have their effect in changing the char- 
acter of the organisms. As, in the past, they have 
acted in varying combinations upon different organ- 
isms, the effect has been to develop variations in the 
structure of the organisms, so that to-day, in the 
organic world, Nature knows no duplicates. 
Variation and individuality. Evolution has seized 
and held variations and fixed them into new species; 
by just what method we need not concern ourselves 
here. For the teacher the lesson is that she must rec- 
ognize variation and individuality; first, because they 
are facts of the present, and secondly, because they 
are the hope of the future. Hence, on behalf of the 
present, she must accept them; and, on behalf of the 
future, she must encourage them. 
She must loyally accept variation and individuality 
in her daily work. She must recognize that children 
grow — they are not coined as in a mint. Therefore, 
she must keep the metallic out of her treatment of 
them. It is hard to accept this fact. We so thoroughly 
realize the economy effected by reducing classroom 
procedure to rules and regularity that we resent the 
presence of individuals who are unruly and irregular. 
There is such an evident gain in teaching and dis- 
ciplining en bloc that we are tempted to lose our temper 
in the presence of disturbing individuality. We are
-P-A-G-E-53
  MORAL DEVELOPMENT 41 
prone to thrust the individuality of the individual out 
of our minds as we go about our daily duty of handling 
large classes of pupils. 
“Good” and “bad” relative terms. One result 
is that we make hasty estimates as to moral values 
and draw careless generalizations therefrom. For in- 
stance, teachers get into the unfortunate habit of 
talking about good boys and bad boys, as though 
humanity were to be grouped about two types of 
individuals, one the “good” and the other the “bad.” 
Goodness is a very vague and indefinable thing. It 
is not an elementary characteristic; it is a compound 
of myriad thoughts and emotions. Even if it were 
possible to totalize these components into something 
which we might entitle “goodness” we should see 
that it would represent only a relative condition. 
There could be no intrinsically all-good person to be 
offset against an intrinsically all-bad person. 
“Good” and “bad” are relative terms. “That we 
call children good or bad does not mean that there 
are two types or modes of character. .. . Variations 
in any single trait are usually continuous . . . usually 
cluster around one and only one type.”! This is par- 
1 Edward L. Thorndike, Individuality, pp. 18-14. Teachers will 
find this monograph of interest as a concise presentation of individ- 
ual traits. The following excerpts are cited as bearing on the facts 
of sex differences: — 
“Tn no trait of those studied has a gap been found between the 
distributions for the two sexes. The upper extreme of one sex al- 
ways overlaps the lower extreme of the other. Some girls like to 
fight better than some boys; some men are fonder of babies than 
some women.” (Page 30.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  42 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
ticularly true of the composite trait we call “good- 
ness,” or of its converse, “‘badness.” 
Mixtures of good and bad in all. The real condition 
is that there is a certain average mixture of good and 
bad that represents the type of the great mass of 
humanity. Sloping away from the average in one 
direction are the constantly decreasing numbers of 
people who have an increasing proportion of the good 
characteristics, and in the opposite direction those 
of the bad characteristics. Dr. Thorndike sums it up 
in these words: — 
There is indeed no habit of thought about human nature 
more important for the understanding of individuality than 
the habit of thinking of the different amounts or degrees of 
each single quality or trait as distances along a scale, and of 
men and women as distributed along that scale, each at his 
proper point.? 
Translating this graphically may put it before us 
more forcibly. Suppose it were possible to grade all 
people along a scale of goodness, say from 0, utter 
“Nearly all women are more original than the least original man, 
and probably over a third of women are more original than the 
average man. Nearly all men are more religious than the least 
religious woman, and probably about a third are more religious 
than the average woman.” (Page 31.) 
“The greatest scientists, poets, painters, and musicians have been 
more frequently males for the same reason that idiots are more 
often males.” 
“Sex, then, though a real influence, is not so great an influence, 
in making individuals differ as has been supposed. Many traits are 
practically uninfluenced by it. The variations within one sex are not 
very much less than the variations amongst men and men together.”

depravity or total lack of goodness, to 100, the ideal 
perfection of goodness. Then the curve representing 
all people might conceiv- 
ably be either of the three (4)

The true condition is

is to think that a class is 
represented by (B) com- 
prising one type, the bad 
boy, and another type, (C) 
the good boy. As a matter 0 30 100 
of fact, the class groups 
about a central average 
type, as in (C), merging in both directions toward 
the boys who are more good or less good than the 
type: that is, in the broadest view and the largest 
definition, there is no such phenomenon as the “bad 
boy.” The individual is a complex composite of all 
sorts of traits, with the number of desirable traits 
and the number of undesirable traits bearing all 
sorts of ratios to each other. It is this individual 
that we have actually before us in our disciplinary ” 
problems. 
Recognizing and encouraging the individual. Many 
teachers act as though they were warranted in ignor- 
ing this basic fact. And yet the necessity for recogniz- 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
    
44 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
ing the individuality of the individual is by no means 
a new thought, as is witnessed by the dissertation 
on The Good Schoolmaster, by Rev. Thomas Fuller 
(1608-1661), in which he says: — 
he studieth his scholars’ natures as carefully as they their 
books; and ranks their dispositions into several forms. And 
though it may seem difficult for him in a great school to 
descend to all particulars, yet experienced schoolmasters 
may quickly make a grammar of boys’ natures.! 
Not only must we accept individuality because of 
its omnipresence, but we must encourage it for the 
benefit of the future. It is by virtue of the most widely 
divergent of its kind that the species changes either in 
progress or in retrogress. So if we are to put optimism 
into practice we will not seek to restrict favorable 
variation in individual pupils. The more erratic they 
are, in a favorable sense, the more encouragement 
must we afford them to develop their erraticalness. 
It is by virtue of the “sports” that Mr. Burbank and 
his fellow wizards of the herbarium create new species, 
and it is by virtue of the sports in the higher biology 
that the schools and the race will create a newer and 
nobler humanity.” 
1 I cannot refrain from adding to the quotation the concluding 
canny paragraph: “Let this, amongst other motives, make school- 
masters careful in their place — that the eminences of their scholars 
have commended the memories of their schoolmasters to pos- 
terity.” 
2 Says William E. Kellicott, in The Social Direction of Human 
Evolution, speaking of mutations (sports) (p. 67): “They are of the 
greatest value in evolution, for it seems quite likely that it is only 
through the permanent racial fixation of these mutations that per-

Heredity and environment. In studying the deriva- 
tion of the moral traits of the human individual, we 
find ourselves reckoning with two factors, heredity 
and environment. In deepest reality these two are but 
one. The organism changes because of the forces push- 
ing upon it from without,— environment. The re- 
sulting changes are recorded not only in the organism 
itself, but in its descendent organisms. Thus is envi- 
ronment passed on from generation to generation, 
and each individual may be regarded as the expression 
of the sum total of the environmental forces of time 
upon his ancestors. Heredity, if the phrase may be 
used, is but canned environment.! We proceed to 
consider these two factors, first heredity and then 
environment. 
manent changes in the characters of a breed may be effected, i.e., 
evolution occurs primarily through mutation.” 
And again (p. 74): “Elevation from mediocrity to superiority 
has far greater effect upon the social constitution than has elevation 
from inferiority to mediocrity.” 
1 Or, to borrow more conventional phrasing, “We do notremember 
this ancient life as we remember our own past experiences, but it 
stirs in us in all new fundamental attitudes and feelings, adding a 
momentum of interest or feeling which cannot be explained by 
reference to anything the individual has learned. We must assume 
that the effects of environment and manner of life, during this 
millions of years our progenitors have lived upon the earth, have 
left traces in the nervous system which are inherited from genera- 
tion to generation; which have accumulated, have become modified, 
utilized, or partly obliterated in many ways; and which still appear, 
varying in degree and form in each new individual. Whatever has 
affected the race deeply, whatever has been for a long time feared, 
or contended with, must thus have left its marks and have influenced 
inheritance.” (G. E. Partridge, Genetic Philosophy of Education,» 
p. 83.)

  CHAPTER VI 
HEREDITY 
The tree of ascent. Our physical and mental de- 
velopment has extended through a time-long series. 
Despite the continuity of the series, there have been 
epochs in which the development has not been in ac- 
cordance with the lines of ultimate human progress. 
“=” The tree of ascent has not been one en- 
tirely of convergence toward man, which 
might be schemed as in (A). Instead, it 
has had countless offshoots from earlier 
stems leading to species which could never 
| eel to turn back to the line of human 
derivation, as in (B). Moreover, even 
(zy) along the direct line leading to man of 
to-day, progress has been not as in (C); but after 
the fashion of (D). That is, progress has been by

and starts, by the attainment of a series of 
plateaus, with even occasional descents in retrogress.
-P-A-G-E-59
  HEREDITY 47 
This phenomenon of progress-plateaus is frequently 
encountered. For instance, it is in this manner that 
our habits are acquired. Learning a game, such as 
bowling, golf, tennis, is an example. Here the uni- 
versal experience is that one increases his skill for a 
while, perhaps with what is known as “beginner’s 
luck,” then has his “off-days”’ when he cannot even 
equal his earlier scores, then gains again, and so con- 
tinues through a series of gains and slumps. It is 
important for us to keep in mind these slopes and 
plateaus of progress, for we shall have occasion to refer 
to them in later discussion. 
Periods of development. The continuity of develop- 
‘ment clearly prevents our marking it off into rigidly 
defined stages. In attempting to divide it, even 
roughly, we might plot a thousand epochs in the an- 
cestry of man. For convenience in the study of our 
present problem, however, we divide it into five 
periods, with the understanding that there are and 
can be no sharp lines of demarcation between them. 
These periods are, in order, — 
1. Organic. 
2. Animal. 
8. Human. 
4. Racial. 
5. Family. 
This represents our family tree, root-end up. So 
far as we know, only organic life grows from withia, 
that is, is capable of true development. At exactly
-P-A-G-E-60
ene en eee 
48 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
what point organic life divides into plant and animal, 
the biologist cannot tell us. It is clear enough, though, 
that our ascent is from the animal and not from the 
plant. Again, just where subhuman species merged 
into man cannot be determined; but we can make 
shrewd general guesses as to the character of man’s 
subhuman ancestors. So, too, differences as to race 
are not clearly marked, although we make arbitrary 
distinctions. How far one’s family extends into distant 
relationship is equally difficult to determine. Most of 
us enjoy the pastime of tracing our ancestry back for 
a few generations, but when we run into thugs and 
thieves we quit— we have crossed the “family” 
limits. 
Traveling back over the ancestral line, we realize that 
relationships are more intimate the younger they are: 
that is, in general, I respond more intimately and more 
favorably to my relatives within my family than to 
those more distant. So, too, I feel more closely re- 
lated to a Caucasian than to a Chinaman, to a China- 
man than to a kangaroo, to a kangaroo than to a cab- 
bage. 
The ancestral mind-tree. We scarcely have to de- 
fine heredity: “the name given to the generalization, 
drawn from the observed facts, that animals and plants 
closely resemble their progenitors.” The son is like 
his father; and conversely, the child is father of the 
man. And this resemblance is not only of physical 
” traits but of mental as well. The body of man does
-P-A-G-E-61
a oe HEREDITY 49 
‘not much resemble his distant ancestor, the proto- i 
plasmic unit; yet physically he is little more than a 
collection of such units. Likewise, the mind of man 
does not much resemble the sentiency of the cell; yet 
mentally he is little more than a complex of such 
sentiencies. There is, then, an ancestral tree of mind 
corresponding to that of body, and our concern in our | 
present study is chiefly with the line of mental descent. 
Organisms, including even the lowest forms, as we | 
have noted, respond to outside stimulus. Presumably 
they feel, then act. The greater the number of gen- 
erations that have been acted upon in the same way, 
the greater the number of those who have been feeling 
in the same way and responding with specific actions 
in the same way. Consequently, through successive 
generations, there is an accumulation of tendency to 
feel and to act. These tendencies, according to Pro- 
fessor James’s terminology, we call respectively emo- 
tions and instincts. We may regard them, in refer- 
ence to the psychology of intellect, feeling, and will, 
as actions from which the intellect factor has been 
practically eliminated: that is, the particular reaction 
has been repeated so many times in so many genera- 
tions that finally no judgment is required in per- 
forming the act. 
Value of instincts. Very fortunate it is for us that 
we have our instincts. Without them life in our pres- 
ent civilization would be quite impossible. Imagine 
having to think out de novo, every time it is presented   %
-P-A-G-E-62
  50 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
to us, the question as to whether we should dodge 
when we see the missile coming. Our instincts, then, 
are those tendencies which lead to actions minus the 
intellectualizing process. Our ancestors have done the 
thinking for us. Moreover, we are daily continuing 
this process of converting intellect-guided actions into 
instinctive actions.! 
Strength of an instinct measures its age. A general 
law underlying instinct is that the age of an instinct 
measures its strength. Conversely, the force of an 
instinct indicates its age. Naturally we respond most 
forcibly in those directions in which our ancestors have 
been responding for the longest while. 
To give a simple illustration, suppose that, making 
a call on a wintry night, you are invited by your host 
to choose between two rooms in which to sit and chat. 
The first is equipped with all the modern appliances 
for securing proper heat and ventilation, thermostatic 
control, fresh-air supply, humidity regulated — in 
short, it is a perfectly ventilated room. The other is 
lighted by a glowing open fire, the logs piled high in 
1H. Wildon Carr, Henri Bergson, pp. 41, 42: “Instinct is intelli- 
gence become automatic, and intelligence is always tending to be- 
come instinct... . 
“Constructive action is immediate and direct, the apprehension 
of the object is followed by the appropriate action without any 
interval of hesitation, without any time for deliberation and choice. 
Intelligence, on the other hand, is just this hesitation, deliberation, 
and choice... . 
“Tnstinct is immediate knowledge. Knowledge such as intuition 
gives us, and being continued in the action, is therefore unconscious; 
intelligence represents the action in idea before it acts, hesitates and 
deliberates, and is therefore conscious.”
-P-A-G-E-63
  HEREDITY 51 
crackling cheer — but it is quite faulty as to ventila- 
tion; in fact, there is a window open and it is somewhat 
drafty. By all the canons of health you should choose 
the first room, but I venture the guess that you would 
unhesitatingly seek the open fire. This means, of 
course, that for generation after generation we have 
been using fire as one of our elementary tools.1_ We 
have been hugging the fire and associating it with 
cheer and comfort, while steam heat is but a youthful 
institution. There is little poetry about a steam radi- 
ator; there is the poetry of race upon race stored in the 
open fire. Our instincts outweigh our conventions. 
It becomes our duty, then, to study our tendency 
inheritance of emotions and instincts, tracing their 
origin into the shadowy but potent past — “A force 
as imposing and rigid as destiny.” Hence we briefly 
survey, in turn, the five epochs into which we have 
arbitrarily marked off the ancestral chronicles of man. 
1 Joseph Knowles, in his interesting adventure, Alone in the Wil- 
derness (pp. 41, 42), writes his eulogy of fire: “Fire was my greatest 
asset in the woods, by far. With a fire you have got about everything. 
It would be difficult — in fact, I do not believe a man could get 
along for any length of time in the wilderness without it. First of 
all, it aids you in a hundred ways. Next, it is a comfort — a won- 
derful comfort. ... As I look back on it now, it seems as if it did 
about everything for me.” _
-P-A-G-E-64
CHAPTER VII 
THE PRIMAL HERITAGE 
Self-preservation and reproduction. Two of our 
instincts run their roots deep into the very earliest of 
the five epochs of our ancestry. These are the self- 
preservative and the reproductive instincts. Even in 
plant life the will to live is ever-present. Certainly 
there is tenacity of life; and the poet in us, if not the 
scientist, translates this tenacity into terms of an in- 
stinct to preserve self. Individualism and egoism are 
present to the extent that each plant seems deter- 
mined to preserve its own life regardless of the expense 
to other life forms. In fanciful mood we may even 
seem to hear the majestic tree voice its protest against 
the blighting stroke of the ax. Scarcely less dominant 
in plant life is the push of the reproductive instinct. 
It is not enough that the individual shall have its own 
compelling day, but it must likewise persist in the 
forms of descendant individuals. 
Differentiation with locomotion. With the clear dif- 
ferentiation of animal forms from other organic life, 
each of these two instincts undergoes marked modifica- 
tion. One of the broad distinctions between plant and 
animal is that the plant has motion and the animal 
locomotion. Plants, deriving their sustenance from
-P-A-G-E-65
  
THE PRIMAL HERITAGE 53 
the immediate air and the immediate soil, need not 
move about laterally. Animals, however, have gained 
the power to go about seeking their food. The newly 
gained attribute of locomotion has its effect upon the 
character of the instincts. 
The instinct of self-preservation, vigorous as ever, 
now has new relationships arising from the new free- 
dom. The instinct takes on a triple phase; in allitera- 
tive terms, feeding, fearing, and fighting. With the 
increasing ability to chase and capture food and to 
elude and escape seizure as food, there come more 
prominently into action the fight for food and the fear 
of becoming food. Eat or be eaten, is the law of the 
jungle; and the invariable desire of the individual is 
that he be the eater and not the eatee. Consequently 
sense acuteness develops to a remarkable degree. 
In passing, we may note that this sense acuteness 
as evinced in subhuman animal life is not necessarily 
desirable as a trait of human life in modern days. The 
acute sense of smell, for example, so valuable an asset 
to the hound, could be to us little else than a serious 
embarrassment. Hence, we must not be carried away 
by the recurrent cults that would set before us as the 
educational goal the maximal development of sense 
perception. 
Use of sense acuteness. Nevertheless, in our school 
practice we daily make legitimate use of this developed 
sense acuteness. In fact all involuntary attention is 
based upon it. For instance, when the class is lagging att
-P-A-G-E-66
54 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
during a blackboard presentation of a subject, we 
unexpectedly write a significant word or letter in red. 
Immediately there is an involuntary start of atten- 
tion. The child has inevitably fallen back to the in- 
stinct that taught his ancestors in the jungle to be- 
ware of the flash of color. That sudden flicker of red 
thirty feet from him spelled danger; to see it in time 
meant safety; to neglect it might mean to be eaten. 
So now the child — the product of the long ancestral 
line — attends on the instant to this hereditary warn- 
ing. Caution, of course, is to be heeded by the teacher 
in using this form of appeal. Blackboards loaded with 
words and symbols in colored chalk would soon become 
an accustomed and not-to-be-feared environment. 
The same caution is needed in the use of appeals to 
the sense of hearing, such as snapping the fingers, 
striking the desk or blackboard, etc. Properly effica- 
cious ‘as such stimuli are when employed deliberately 
and intelligently, they fail of their purpose when used 
to excess. Moreover, such use is a hindrance to good 
control of a class. 
Locomotion and the reproductive instinct. The ac- 
cession of locomotive power in the course of evolu- 
tion has its corresponding effect upon the force and 
character of the reproductive instinct. There are now 
newly developed phases of satisfaction. Pursuit and 
capture have a motive aside from the feeding ele- 
ment. Fearing has a new association; fighting has a 
new casus belli, Likewise the consequences of satisfy-
-P-A-G-E-67
THE PRIMAL HERITAGE 55 
ing the instinct become more complicated. New and 
powerful emotions develop as aftermath. The feroc- 
ity of the feline mother guarding her cubs is proverbial. 
There come into play, too, frequent conflicts be- 
tween the two forces of self-preservation and reproduc- 
tion, as one may witness almost any day. One sum- 
mer afternoon I watched the conflict as it possessed 
the heart of a phcebe bird. Her nest was stoutly built 
under the porch roof and her brood was yet in the 
dependent stage, but she would not remain at the nest 
during the day while any one was on the porch. On 
this afternoon there was a heavy shower and, as I 
chose to sit it out, mother phoebe was very evidently 
distressed. After half an hour of fluttering back and 
forth between a perch at safe distance and the seem- 
ingly threatened nest that needed her protection, she 
finally settled herself at home. I have no ambition to 
figure as a “nature fakir,” and so I do not presume to 
know what was going on in the mind of little phcebe. 
However, I confidently suspect that she was being 
pulled by these two conflicting instincts, both of which 
lay so deep in her fluttering heart that the contest was 
by no means one-sided. 
Rise of the social instinct. In addition to reinforc- 
ing and modifying the two most ancient of instincts, 
locomotion develops from these yet a third, the social 
instinct. At this epoch of animal development, it ap- 
pears as little higher than mere gregariousness. 
Animals early found that they would feed more, fight 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  56 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM © 
better, and fear less, when living in groups than when 
living alone. Hence the development of the herd, the 
pack, the school, the flock — all variants of the term 
“social group.” Here is the basis of our “gang”; and 
we are wise if we recognize the deep hold which the 
spirit of the gang — by virtue of its great antiquity as 
a controlling instinct — has upon youth. 
Out of this social instinct has developed a group of 
other instincts which are called the adaptive. They 
take the three chief forms of imitation, play, and 
curiosity. All three are found in moderate form in 
animal life, but it is only in the human individual that 
they develop as direct causes and modifiers of conduct. 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
CHAPTER VIII 
THE HUMAN HERITAGE 
Human modification of instincts. At the human 
stage the elementary tendencies undergo still further 
modification. The instinct of self-preservation be- 
comes overlaid with a vast complex of non-egoistic 
promptings, so that in the ordinary affairs of life it is 
somewhat submerged. But it is by no means annihi- 
lated; and fortunately so, for through it, after all, the 
human world moves on to accomplishment. In its 
grosser forms it is but half hidden by more modern 
traits. There are times when it comes boldly and even 
fiercely to the front, — times when there are not enough 
life preservers to go around. Then courtesy, refine- 
ment, deference, a host of other conventions, are ig- 
nominiously put to flight by its impetuous onrush. 
’ The reproductive instinct, too, becomes subordi- 
nated to later-developed interests. The impulse to the 
specific creative act is no longer of periodic occur- 
rence, as in the case of the animals, but is distributed 
over the entire year. Civilized man has learned the 
unwisdom of yielding in excess to the push of this 
necessary instinct. Restraint has led to tension, and 
it is on this tension that the creative work of the race 
has been performed. Creation has found other expres- 
sion besides human offspring. It is this instinct that 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
' 68 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
has furnished the leverage by which marvelous works 
of mechanical skill have been reared. It is this that 
has given us our art. 
Gregariousness. In humankind the social instinct 
passes beyond the limits of mere gregariousness. It 
is true that, in spots, we inherit this grosser form of the 
social impulse, to our detriment. The slum life of our 
large towns is based upon it. It would undoubtedly 
be for the lasting benefit of the people of certain sec- 
tions of our cities, if we could legislate the gregarious 
instinct out of them. They insist on living in herds for 
the very joy of herding. Even in the highest expres- 
sion of our civilization we are in a sense strongly gre- 
garious, but it is a gregariousness that knows no space. 
Through the inventions — the mail, the telegraph, 
the telephone, the wireless — we virtually touch el- 
bows with the inhabitants of the earth. Almost liter- 
ally, every man is my neighbor. 
Altruism. The animals herd through selfish mo- 
tives — to feed and to fight with lessened fear. In 
man gregariousness flowers into the more beautiful 
forms of sympathy and altruism. John Fiske’s the- 
ory of the rise of altruism through the lengthening 
period of infancy, seems to meet universal acceptance. 
The kitten, a few days after birth, is ready to take its 
place in the world of cats. The human kitten needs 
many years before it can hold its place in the world 
of men. If one considered this fact but lightly he 
might conclude that the kitten had the advantage.
-P-A-G-E-71
THE HUMAN HERITAGE 59 
It is through the pressure of the self-preservative in- 
stinct that animals, including man, have developed 
the social instinct in its grosser forms; it is through 
the reproductive instinct that man has developed it 
in its finer forms. In the history of the race, the pe- 
riod of helplessness of the infant has stretched from 
day to day and from year to year, and the interest 
of the parent has been elicited to an ever keener ° 
degree. Interest in offspring has developed love for, 
them. In turn, the family has been established, and, 
from love for family, it has been an easy transition to 
love for those less closely related. 
Imitation, play, and curiosity. This lengthened in- 
fancy operates, too, to modify the adaptive instincts, 
developing imitation, play, and curiosity into their 
higher forms. Infancy means mental plasticity; con- 
sequently the longer it lasts the more moldable is the 
individual and the more opportunity is there for his 
development. In fact, these three adaptive instincts 
are the chief instruments in our educative mechanics. 
Imitation is the response to all of our educational 
method that says, “Do as I do.” Curiosity is the 
foundation of scientific research. Play is the foretaste 
of work.! All three involve interest and attention; 
1 Colvin and Bagley, Human Behavior, pp. 50, 51: “Play, — 
An activity performed quite spontaneously and for no conscious 
purpose beyond the activity itself... . Work, — An activity not 
pleasurable in itself, and hence not undertaken for its own sake, but 
for an ulterior purpose.” 
“Play differs from work, not in the obstacles surmounted nor in the 
amount of energy expended but in the spirit in which it is done.” 
(Ibid., p. 40.)
-P-A-G-E-72
60 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
and mental development is largely a matter of in- 
creasing the duration of voluntary attention. The child 
puts his blocks together in an elaborate combination, 
spending many minutes in painstaking labor — then 
with a sudden gesture he knocks down the whole 
structure. Nor can he be induced to continue the 
work of construction; his interest has already flitted 
toward other things. Education trains him to attend 
to the one task for a longer period, and eventually 
we dignify his play by calling it work. It is in his 
ability to work that man, alone among all the animals, 
exhibits a capacity for progress. 
The moral and religious instinct. Man, in addition 
to modifying and ennobling the four chief instincts 
that operate in subhuman animals, has originated a 
fifth, the moral or religious instinct. A distinction may 
be made between these two, but, striking for broad 
general principles as we are, we will regard them as a 
single group. We may remark, too, that there is a 
school of philosophers who would trace the moral pur- 
pose clear back to the beginning of all life, but we 
will be on safer if not surer ground if we regard it as 
a characteristic of humankind only. 
As the adaptive instincts are the basis of our educa- 
tion of intellect, so the moral instinct is the basis of 
our development of the moral sense in the individual. 
This is perhaps the chief difference between the mental 
life of man and that of the other animals. We can 
train a dog to right conduct, that is, to conduct satis-
-P-A-G-E-73
  
THE HUMAN HERITAGE 61 
factory to us, his masters; in the same way we can 
train a child to satisfactory conduct. But we cannot 
educate the dog to a sense of moral values, although 
we can educate the child, by virtue of this moral in- 
stinct, to discriminate between right and wrong. The 
dog, in his wanderings, comes upon a piece of meat 
displayed on a counter. The mental process and the 
resultant act seem simple enough: meat, stimulus, 
hunger, response, seizure. The hungry man comes 
upon the meat, and the process is the same to a cer- 
tain point, the point where the moral sense inter- 
feres: meat, stimulus, hunger, response — the thought 
“not mine,” the restrained hand. Thus does man 
show his capacity for progress in the high realm of 
morals, 
Order of development of groups of instincts. To 
summarize, the development of our groups of instincts 
seems to have been in this order: self-preservative, 
reproductive, social, adaptive, moral.! The principle 
1 A clear and interesting presentation of the subject of instincts 
will be found in E. A. Kirkpatrick’s Fundamentals of Child Study, 
p. 51, et seq. 
Colvin and Bagley in their Human Behavior (p. 126, et seq.) have 
also a valuable discussion. They group the instincts as follows: — 
Adaptive : imitation, repetition, play, inquisitiveness, constructive- 
ness, migration, acquisitiveness. 
Individualistic : 
(A) Self-protective: combative, retractive, repulsive. 
(B) Self-assertive. 
(C) Antisocial: teasing and bullying, predatory, shyness. 
Sex and Parental : sex, protection of young. 
Social : rivalry, gregarious, codperative, altruistic. 
Religious : self-abasement. 
Zisthetic : rhythmic.
-P-A-G-E-74
  62 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
that our instincts are strong in proportion to their age 
indicates that the moral instinct is severely handi- 
capped by its youth. The teacher must remember 
this as she faces the discouragements of the classroom. 
She will then cease to wonder that the boy does not 
always behave. She will realize that the youngest of 
his instincts has been borne down in the unequal con- 
flict with the brute force of the ancient impulses. But 
the defeat need be but temporary and it may be less 
frequently repeated. The aim of the school, then, in 
its work of moral culture, is to strengthen the young 
instincts in their struggle with the older. It is the 
privilege of the teacher to stand by, attendant upon 
the youthful captain of the fight, fitting upon him the 
armor of Emerson’s phrase — 
“So nigh is grandeur to our dust, 
So near is God to man, 
When duty whispers low, ‘Thou must,’ 
The youth replies, ‘I can.’”
-P-A-G-E-75
CHAPTER IX 
THE RACIAL HERITAGE 
Physical and mental differences. The point at which 
the human animal diverged into those subgroups 
which we call “race” is as indistinct in the gloom of 
the past as are the points of divergence into those 
other groupings that seem now so stable and funda- 
mental. To-day we are able to classify humankind 
into fairly well-marked groups, each with its main 
physical and mental characteristics. Physical differ- 
ences as to hair, eyes, stature, and the like are clearly 
present. Scarcely less pronounced are the mental 
differences, in intellect, feeling, and will, although the 
instincts inherited from the remote past are common 
to all. Along with these natural differences in char- 
acteristic mental reactions, there goes a wide vari- 
ability of moral standards. 
The American school, in many communities, enrolls 
pupils of all sorts of races and nationalities. The 
teacher in such a school will have little success unless 
she has, or develops, a broad catholicity. She must 
have a ready recognition of the racial variations and 
a receptive toleration for the variant standards in 
living and in morals. 
Racial heritage. It is not necessary here to make  
-P-A-G-E-76
64 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
any detailed study of racial history. The teacher is 
merely urged to keep in mind the distinctive racial 
heritages of the pupils of her class. For instance, she 
will recall the years of servitude that mark the in- 
heritance of the American negro, and allow for it ac- 
cordingly. She will compare this inheritance with 
that of the descendant of the American pioneer, char- 
acterized by Mrs. Wiggin in vigorous language: — 
Our American children are as precocious in will power 
as they are keen-witted, and they need a special discipline. 
The courage, activity, and pioneer spirit of the fathers, ex- 
ercised in hewing their way through virgin forests, hunting 
wild beasts in mountain solitudes, opening up undeveloped 
lands, prospecting for metals through trackless plains, 
choosing their own vocations, helping to govern their coun- 
try, — all these things have reacted upon the children, and 
they are thoroughly independent, feeling the need of caring 
for themselves when hardly able to toddle.? 
Speaking of thirty-seven cities investigated by 
the Immigration Commission, Mr. Haskin says: — 
The children of the races who do not speak English have 
rather a hard time getting started. There are a few excep- 
tions. For instance, in the case of the Swedes, there are only 
a little more than half as many of their children behind in 
their studies as there are among the native American chil- 
1 Oscar Peschel, in his The Races of Man (p. 821), separates man- 
kind into seven groups — the inhabitants of Australia and Tas- 
mania; the Papuans; the Mongoloid nations; the Dravida of Western 
India; the Hottentots and Bushmen; the Negroes; and the Cauca- 
sians. The main divisions are, of course, subject to much subgroup- 
ing. In The Immigrant Tide ; Its Flow and Ebb, Professor Steiner has 
an appendix showing the classification of the new immigrant groups.

dren. The little Dutch boys and girls show about the same 
amount of precocity. But when it comes to some of the other 
nationalities there is a different story. Two thirds of the 
Polish Jew children have an unequal struggle in their work, 
while nearly two thirds of the children from sunny southern 
Italy are unable to keep up with their American fellow 
pupils. More than half of the Slovaks, Magyars, Poles, 
North Italians, and Jews are behind the normal quali- 
fications of their years. ...The non-English-speaking for- 
eigners’ children show only forty-three retarded pupils out 
of a hundred, the negro children show sixty-nine.! 
Our cosmopolitan population. Professor Steiner, 
speaking of the public schools of Hartford, says: — 
T have been in schoolrooms there, in the first grade, where 
ninety per cent of the children were of alien birth, and at a 
glance I knew their nationality. 
Italians, miniature old men and women, although scarcely 
seven years of age. 
Serious, little black-eyed Jews, with the burden of ages 
upon their bent backs. 
Polish boys and girls, with small foreheads, as if some 
tyrant had trampled upon their heads. 
Armenians, sad-looking, dark-skinned creatures, haunted 
by the remembrance of their village street, red from the 
blood of the slain. 
Syrian children, out of the very village in whose meadows 
the angels sang when Christ was born; but who have never 
known either peace or good-will.? 
Professor Steiner gives striking credit to the schools 
in their work of helping the immigrant to overcome 
these racial handicaps, saying: — 
I have been to your High School, and there the marks

were all but obliterated; there was “neither Jew nor Greek, 
neither Roman nor Barbarian”’; they were all a new people. 
The teachers of America may count themselves 
fortunate that they have the privilege of taking part 
in this great process of race absorption, a process that 
can lead Professor Steiner to exclaim: — 
I know no Fatherland but America; for after all, it matters 
less where one was born, than where one’s ideals had their 
birth; and to me, America is not the land of mighty dollars 
but the land of great ideals.

  CHAPTER X 
THE FAMILY HERITAGE 
The family heritage. The family is peculiarly an 
institution of human development. It has “‘adumbra- 
tions and foreshadowings among the lower animals,” 
says John Fiske, “but in general it may be said that 
while mammals lower than man are gregarious, in man 
have become established those peculiar relationships 
which constitute what we know as the family.’’! It is 
from this family line — his more immediate ancestors 
— that the individual inherits those attributes that 
most distinguish him from his fellows. His general 
characteristics are the heritage of the time-old human 
race; his individual variation from the average is due 
to his more immediate ancestry. This variation may 
take the form of physical peculiarities of strength or 
weakness, or tendency to immunity to disease in 
general or to susceptibility to specific disease, or 
mental attributes of intellect or of feeling or of will. 
The instinct inheritance has accumulated through 
countless generations; it is difficult to conceive of any 
single generation wherein the self-preservative im- 
pulse, for instance, has been wanting. It is easy to 
see that the latest instinct — the moral and religious 
1 John Fiske, The Meaning of Infancy; Riverside Educational 
Monographs, p. 29.
-P-A-G-E-80
  68 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
— is comparatively so recent that we may regard it 
as not firmly established: that is, the line of the in- 
dividual may contain many progenitors in whom this 
instinct has been weak or perhaps entirely absent. 
Thus is his immediate inheritance one of strong ele- 
mental instincts and weak morality. 
Intellect heritage. Intellect, feeling, and will are all 
affected by the family heritage. Intellectuality is a 
characteristic of the human animal. One human in- 
dividual may have an ancestral line in which intel- 
lectual strength has been accumulated through the 
generations. Another may have one in which the 
growth of the intellect brain centers has been consis- 
tently retarded. In one case the product is an individ- 
ual who has the innate ability to reason cogently on all 
matters coming to his experience, including those in- 
volving moral issues; in the other case the product is 
an individual who is innately incapable of forming 
logical judgments on any subject. Thus, at one ex- 
treme we have a Plato or a Descartes or a Spencer; and, 
at the other, the imbecile of impoverished mind. And 
between the heights of a critic of pure reason and the 
depths of idiocy, countless grades of intellectual ability 
are represented in the sons of men. It is these varia- 
tions in degree that the teacher meets in the class- 
room. Hence she cannot expect to find among the 
variant members of her class equal inherited ability to 
sense the truth, in ethics any more than in mathe- 
matics. .
-P-A-G-E-81
  THE FAMILY HERITAGE 69 
Emotion heritage. Emotion, also, is raised to its 
ideal forms in the human stage only, and in this re- 
spect, too, the family heritage has its effect in deter- 
mining the innate characteristics of the individual. 
The trophies of victory of the ideal over the base may 
be passed along from generation to generation; or 
perhaps it is the sordid that persists. Thus the pro- 
duct may be an individual motived by lofty sentiment 
or one moved only by crude sense demands, — at one 
extreme a Phidias or a Joan of Arc or a Beethoven; at 
the other, a sodden groveler devoid of ideals. Between 
the poet and the clod there are countless grades of 
emotional ability. These variations, like those in in- 
tellectual power, appear in the class, and further com- 
plicate the problem of the teacher. 
Will heritage. The will of the individual is equally 
susceptible to the influences of the family heritage. 
Environmental stimuli resulting in physical sturdiness 
may persist through generations, to issue in an indi- 
vidual of natural fortitude and courage. Or physical 
impairment may descend through the line and accu- 
mulate in a product completely lacking in will power. 
Hence the difference between a Socrates or a Bismarck 
or a Lincoln and the enervated creature blown by 
every vagrant mood. So between the hero and the 
weakling there are numberless grades of will ability. 
These variations in will power add their complications 
to the problem of the classroom. 
The family inheritance, then, is likely to be one of 
   
-P-A-G-E-82
  70 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
disturbance from the normal. It is the accidental 
note struck in the chorus of the ages. All of human- 
kind have, in common, the fundamental instincts press- 
ing them on, in quite uniform responses to environ- 
mental stimuli. Each, as an individual, has his more 
immediate heritage of special strength or special weak- 
ness. Thus, he may be able to overrule with a rod of 
iron determination the primal impulses that fight to 
express themselves in wrong directions; or, under an 
inheritance of flabbiness, he may be overwhelmed by 
them. 
Galton’s law of inheritance. The law of inherit- 
ance, most simply stated, is, of course, that children 
resemble their parents. It is of some profit to keep in 
mind Galton’s law, recognizing it, however, as merely — 
a very general statement of an apparent condition. 
According to it, the individual derives one half his indi- 
viduality from his parents, one quarter from his grand- 
parents, one eighth from the next generation, and so on. 
Thus he is made up off } +4 +4+7e+ab.-.> 
the sum of which is unity. Each parent contributes 
one half of the one half, or one fourth; each grand- 
parent, one fourth of the one fourth, or one sixteenth, 
etc. We are not to take this statement with literal 
exactness, but from it we gain an approximate view 
of the make-up of the individual.
-P-A-G-E-83
CHAPTER XI 
ENVIRONMENT 
Heredity vs. environment. We have traced the 
development of the three factors in conduct — in- 
tellect, feeling, and will — throughout their long in- 
heritance: we must now see that they are also influ- 
enced by environment: in fact, they are determined 
by the joint workings of heredity and environment. 
We have been trying to understand the past as the 
interpreter of the present; we must also understand 
the present as the determinant of the future. Heredity 
is time-long; environment is lifelong. Through heredity 
we reach backward and forward into time; through 
environment we reach outward into the world and the 
worlds. Time lays its hand upon us through heredity; 
space through environment. 
The original individuality of each of us is the result 
of inheritance. As the individual, growing, leads his 
own particular life, he is individualized still further 
by environment. Heredity holds sway through surely 
implanted instincts; environment, acting daily afresh, 
makes direct sense appeals upon which are built per- 
cepts and memories and judgments, all modifying the 
inherited complex of the individual. 
No two individuals can possibly have the same com-
-P-A-G-E-84
  72 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
bination of inherited influences. Equally true is it 
that no two individuals — even theoretically absolute 
twins — could for a day retain their exact likeness 
each to each, for moment by moment they are sub- 
jected to different environmental influences. So the 
teacher, accepting and recognizing the individuality 
based upon the varying heritages of each of her pupils, 
must be equally tolerant of the wide differences in 
environment to which they are subject. 
The environment factor. Through Galton’s law we 
see, more or less exactly, how the individual’s inher- 
itance factor is apportioned among his ancestors. 
Roughly, too, we can apportion the environment 
factor as a Laie of influences, of the home, of the 
religious, social, and civic institutions, and of the 
unorganized “street.” 
Environment begins its work at the moment of the 
creation of the joint cell that, in time, is to issue as-a 
human individual. Among the first of environmental 
influences, then, — and not as hereditary, — are to 
be reckoned congenital influences, those which affect 
the individual during the embryo stage. These differ 
widely, indeed. In one home the mother has care 
and attention of the highest order of intelligence; in 
another, she is treated ignorantly or shamefully. 
Hence every babe arrives in the world bearing not 
only the image of his ancestors, but also the reflection 
of his environmental experience of the recent months. 
The home. The home is the great environmental

ENVIRONMENT 73 
force of babyhood, and with declining preéminence 
it operates throughout the succeeding years. It is 
a commonplace to assert the wide difference in the 
types of homes — city and country, rich and poor, 
intelligent and neglected, homes that absorb houses 
and houses that merely shelter human animals. Well 
may the teacher heed the ery: — 
Therefore, you educators of the people, look to the places 
where your pupils live; look into the halls and rooms which 
they call their home; learn the need and misery with which 
their parents must contend and, if you do so, you will meet 
your pupils with understanding eyes and warmer hearts. 
You cannot drive this misery out of the world, but you 
learn charity when you perceive what shadows that misery 
casts upon the school.! 
Not all homes bear the scars of poverty; but even 
people of comfortable means need to be on guard lest 
their very comforts become an environmental factor 
detrimental to their children. Idleness is probably as 
damaging to the child as is excess of labor. Too much 
of personal service may be done for him, leaving him 
too little to do for himself. Then, too, he may be over- 
whelmed with evening parties, entertainments, and 
other social distractions that are distinctly damaging. 
Many a loving parent is carried away by the argu- 
ment that a particular concert or lecture or musicale 
is “educative,” forgetting that there is nothing so 
educative that it can make up for the loss of the sleep 
that the child body cries out for.

  74 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
In our cosmopolitan districts we must consider the 
differing quality of the home environment of the chil- 
dren of different nationalities. The spirit of the Puri- 
tan immigrant of three centuries ago and the spirit 
of the Russian immigrant of to-day are essentially 
one — the spirit of the pioneer. “Ellis Island is an- 
other name for Plymouth Rock,” says Mary Antin. 
Nevertheless, the traditions of the nations are widely 
dissimilar, and for more than one generation we must 
reckon with these differences as they find expression 
in the homes of our pupils. 
Types of environment. Environment spells a very 
different set of influences in the country and in the 
city. In the rural home the child early takes part in 
the industrial life. The systematic doing of “chores” is 
a steadying influence lost to the city boy and girl. In 
the metropolitan districts, organized industry, with its 
factories and its commerce, changes the complexion of 
home life, usually to the impairment of the home as 
an environmental influence. Too often the home is 
no longer a true social center; it has become scarcely 
more than a boarding-place for people but loosely 
held together by family ties, outbound for separate 
duties or pleasures and inbound for meals and lodging. 
Whether in city or in country, in families well-to-do 
or in poverty, under intelligent leadership or governed 
by ignorance and sloth, the home shares its influence

of interests which we generically distinguish as “ the

street.” Fortunate is the child who, throughout his 
entire childhood and youth, has the arm of an intel- 
ligent home protecting him against the attacks of 
untoward outside influences. 
The environment of the street. The whole spirit 
of the street differs in different communities, but un- 
fortunately in most American cities the youth finds 
little there to inspire him to high living. The news- 
papers of any date repeat just such stories as the fol- 
lowing, clipped at random: — 
HURLS BOY TO HIS DEATH 
Peddler Breaks Annoyer’s Head Against a Telegraph Pole 
A crowd of schoolboys raided a fruit and vegetable 
peddler’s wagon at Second and Monroe Streets, Hoboken, 
N.J., yesterday afternoon, and John Depitto, in charge of 
the wagon, gave chase. Persons in the street stopped to 
laugh at the peddler’s efforts, for the small boys dodged and 
slipped away from him with ease. 
Only thirteen-year-old James Swinton seemed unable to 
elude the angry peddler, and the crowd’s laughter turned 
to indignation and rage as they saw the peddler grab the 
boy and fling him headlong against a telegraph pole. Blood 
poured from the boy’s nose, mouth, and eyes and he lay 
unconscious. 
Depitto, terrified by the spectacle and by the rush of 
angry men who sprang at him from every side, took to his 
heels and disappeared down Second Street. 
As the boy was carried inside the hospital he died. The 
physicians said his skull had been fractured. 
Detectives set out to look for Depitto and found him 
hiding in a shed. He was locked up at Police Headquar- 
ters charged with murder.

Notice that there is no report of “angry men” spring- 
ing at the boys who were stealing goods from a mer- 
chant. 
Here we have pictured a street scene typical of 
many an American city, — it just happened to be 
Hoboken in this case, — the bystanding citizens sup- 
porting boys in their brazen violation of the law, and 
then, with a show of righteous indignation, hounding 
the man who dares defend himself. By marked con- 
trast to this scene there comes to mind an incident of 
an afternoon in Germany. Walking one day in Leip- 
zig, my friend Herr Schulze and I saw two little boys 
across the street engaged in a rather innocuous fist 
fight. Herr Schulze paused and called to them. They 
stopped their fight and came to him. Then he scolded 
them roundly for fighting on the streets, telling them 
that they knew they should not do it, that their parents 
would be disgraced, and so on. To all of which the two 
strangers listened attentively, then touched their caps 
respectfully, and slipped away. Imagine Herr Schulze 
attempting that in Hoboken! 
Other envitohmental influences. Beyond the literal 
“street” there are at work various influences, a few 
good, many more sinister, deliberately tempting the 
boy or girl off the street. For every Young Men’s 
Christian Association or Young Men’s Hebrew As- 
sociation, there are a hundred resorts of one or another 
form of temptation — cheap theaters, moving pic- 
tures, low dance halls, all stimulating youth in direc-

tions inimical to sane and normal moral develop- 
ment.! 
The teacher must take a sane view of these in- 
fluences. She should keep particularly in mind two 
principles in regard to them: “Nature abhors a vac- 
uum” and “Do not mistake means for ends.” 
Nature abhors a vacuum. The axiom from the world 
of physics, “Nature abhors a vacuum,” has its counter- 
part in the world of mind and spirit. It is no solution 
whatever of the boy- or girl-problem for the teacher 
or parent merely to say, “I forbid your going into 
such and such places.” Any such prohibition should 
be accompanied by the substitution of some positive 
influence. Boys and girls will promenade the streets 
at night if that is the most interesting occupation in 
sight. They will quit if something more interesting 
is proposed to them, and this “ something ” may, in- 
cidentally, have a positive value. 
1 Teachers should be familiar with the labors and writings of such 
workers as Jane Addams, of Hull House, Chicago. They will also 
profit by reading such books as McKeever, Training the Boy; W. B. 
Forbush, The Boy Problem; J. Adams Puffer, The Boy and his 
Gang; McKeever, Training the Girl; Winifred Buck, Boys’ Self- 
Governing Clubs. 
In The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets, Miss Addams, speaking 
of “the period of groping,” that of sex susceptibility, says (p. 27): 
“This period is difficult everywhere, but it seems at times as if a 
great city almost deliberately increased its perils. The newly awak- 
ened senses are appealed to by all that is gaudy and sensual, by the 
flippant street music, the highly colored theater posters, the trashy 
love stories, the feathered hats, the cheap heroics of the revolvers 
displayed in the pawnshop windows. This fundamental suscepti- 
bility is thus evoked without a corresponding stir of the higher 
imagination, and the result is as dangerous as possible.”

Mistaking means for ends. The mistaking of means | 
for ends is a frequent pitfall for reformers. 
All the new inventions have new sins, even new manners 
that go with them, new virtues and new faculties. The tele- 
phone, the motorcar, the wireless telegraph, the airship and 
the motorboat all make men act with different insights, 
longer distances, and higher speeds. 
We must learn to take over the new inventions — as 
well as the old — into the service of righteousness. 
We are rapidly learning the wisdom of this and acting 
upon it in many of our school systems. Dancing, for 
example, is not necessarily an invention of the Devil, 
but he may use it for his ends, and equally may the 
educator use it for his ends. The more we teach pupils 
in school the yalue of sane rhythmic exercise, the less 
will they be inclined to abuse the dance in outside 
life. 
The “ movies ” as environment. The moving pic- 
ture, or more popularly and affectionately the “moy- 
ies,” is one of the most recent of these inventions. 
The objections to the moving-picture exhibitions are 
chiefly three: there is danger that the quality of the 
scenes may be harmful; there is danger of damage to 
the eyes; there is a weakening of nerve fiber through 
excessive indulgence. 
As to the first of these, the scenario may be harmful 
without being immoral, in the usual sense of the word. 
It may be injurious by presenting wrong ideals tri-

umphant or depicting scenes, such as burglaries, hold- 
ups, etc., so vividly as to act upon feeble minds as 
suggestions to action. Censorship, in one form or 
another, is already making headway in many of our 
cities. The second danger, that to the eyes, is present 
in looking continuously even at the best-made films. 
When old and worn films are used, the strain on the 
eye is proportionately aggravated. 
The third danger is psychical, the least recognized 
and most subtle of all. When one visits the theater 
and witnesses a typical three-act drama, his mind 
dwells for two or three hours on a simple dramatic 
situation and its working-out. The same series of 
events, making the same tax on emotional attention, 
will be run through the cinematograph in half an 
hour or less. Then another series and another follow, 
so that in the course of three hours one’s emotional 
nature has been subjected to a rapid succession of 
tensions, the effects of which are cumulative and 
destructive. 
Attitude of the school. It must be clear that the 
attitude of teachers toward the moving pictures should 
be one of sympathy with the appeal that they make to 
children — and to adults as well. Their efforts should 
be directed toward an improvement in the end to 
which the machine is put, not toward the impossible 
abolition of the machine. The school itself must take 
over this new means of presentation and itself train 
its pupils to accept only the best in this as in other
-P-A-G-E-92
  80 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
lines. The school will develop taste by the material 
it presents so that the pupils will learn to select wisely 
when they patronize the commercial pictures. It will 
teach moderation in use, and show the value of resting 
the eyes between series. 
This discussion of the moving picture has been ex- 
tended only because it illustrates the general attitude 
that the school should take toward all those instru- 
ments that factor in producing an environment nat- 
urally attractive, but nevertheless deleterious to the 
moral fiber of children and youth. The school must 
put its emphasis upon the attraction and use that 
very attractiveness to build up ideals higher than those 
that would be developed by exploiters interested only 
in financial gain.

  CHAPTER XII 
NATURE AND NURTURE 
The individual product. The individual, to repeat, 
is the product of heredity and environment. Those 
who would emphasize the distinction between these 
two factors contrast them, in Galton’s phrase, as the 
work of nature and nurture. On the contrary, as we 
have noted, in one sense, the two factors are but two 
phases of the one — environment. Inheritance is but 
accumulated environment; the newest-born babe is 
the oldest living organism. We must, however, in con- 
sidering the subject from the practical needs of the 
school, hold to the distinction, for, although heredity 
is fixed, environment is controllable. 
When we say that heredity is fixed, we mean, of 
course, that the inheritance of the present generation 
is a fixed quantity. The hereditary factor for future 
generations is, in a measure, subject to present influ- 
ence. Eugenics, in the language of Galton, who coined 
the word, is the “study of agencies that may improve 
or impair the racial qualities of future generations, 
either mentally or physically.” Among the practical 
propositions along the line of prevention of race im- 
pairment is the sterilization of defective individuals.!

This is already provided by law in some States of the 
United States. In the words of Dr. Jordan: — 
If Richard Roe by chance is a defective, unable by heredity 
to rise to the level of helpfulness and happiness, it is not a 
wholesome act to help him to the responsibilities of parent- 
hood. It is wise charity to make him as comfortable as may 
be with the assurance that he shall be the last of his line.* 
It may be pointed out, too, that the theory of in- 
tensive culture, recently being brought to the front 
and applied so successfully in agriculture, is seen to 
have an application in man culture. What the race 
needs, after all, is not quantity of offspring, but 
quality.? Biologically, it would seem that the small 
the feeble-minded, the New York State Charities Aid Association 
makes the following statement: — 
“Tt appears, therefore, that of the 10,000 (estimated) women of 
child-bearing age in the State of New York, only about 1750 are 
cared for in institutions designed for the care of the feeble-minded, 
and about 1625 are confined in reformatories, prisons, and alms- 
houses, while almost 7000 are at large in the community. 
“Dr. Goddard estimates that a feeble-minded girl or woman is 
three times as great a menace to the community as a feeble-minded 
boy or man. One feeble-minded girl or woman will spread the dis- 
ease and immorality at an alarming rate, and greatly increase their 
kind, with a consequent increase in the burden of the State.”

A satisfactory outline of the subject of eugenics will be found in

a twenty-page bibliography.

the brutal birth rates of the past have not made society more effi- 
cient. The mother of many children has only stood more often by 
the open grave. A reasonable birth rate has decided advantage, be- 
cause the mother concentrating her thought on a few healthy child- 
ren is charged with power to promote their future welfare; but if her 
energy is dissipated among a company of short-lived and unwanted

family is an indication of progress, Herbert Spencer 
maintaining that, — 
We might with safety assert the general truths that, 
other things equal, advancing evolution must be accom- 
panied by declining fertility; and that, in the highest types, 
fertility must still further decrease if evolution still further 
increases.1 
Environment controllable. As related to the teacher, 
however, these considerations as to the control of the 
heredity factor, are more or less academic. The school, 
as such, must accept pupils as they are. So that, for 
all practical purposes, we may repeat that the factor 
of heredity is a fixed quantity. But environment is 
controllable. This is the factor that is subject to man- 
ipulation. Hence it is the duty of teachers to manip- 
ulate it in the interest of moral advancement. They 
may all do their share in improving the conditions on 
the street and even in the homes. They may stand 
always on the side of betterment in the conflicts be- 
tween the forces which would save and those which 
would ignore and ruin. They may consistently en- 
courage all the local agencies working for the better- 
ment of conditions. 
It is not to be forgotten, too, that the school itself 
is one of the most important environmental influences 
children the social consequences cannot be hopeful.” This is quoted 
from George B. Mangold, Problems of Child Welfare (p. 23), a book 
of interest to teachers, as may be seen by the titles of its five parts: 
“The Conservation of Life”; “Health and Physique”; “Training 
and Education”; “Child Labor”; and “Juvenile Delinquency.”

that touch the child. Thus every act of the teacher 
and every other stimulus that reaches the child has 
its place of influence in his life. This puts upon school 
managers the specific duty of so manipulating and so 
regulating the school life that it shall, as a phase of 
environment, modify the individual favorably and not 
unfavorably in his moral growth.* 
Heredity, environment, and discipline. In spite of 
the distinction that must be made between heredity 
and environment, in our school work and in school 
discipline both factors merit equal attention in this 
regard; both must be recognized and allowed for. 
Consider the heredity factor as it is shown in two boys 
sitting side by side in a public-school class. There is a 
temptation to dispose of them in thought as two boys 
in the same grade and therefore two boys of uniform 
capability. But the one has pulsing through him the 
red blood of generation after generation of sturdy, 
vigorous manhood and womanhood. His progenitors 
have lived in the open; they have fought successfully 
with the elements; they have wrested from nature 
a wholesome living; they have stood squarely upon 
their own feet: they have thought freely; they have 
1 This thought of the school as an environmental force gives us 
our philosophical definition of the school. It is an artificial environ- 
ment deliberately created in such a form as shall economize the energy 
of the child in gaining experience. This constitutes the sharp dis- 
tinction between education and schooling. All environment edu- 
cates; that which is purposively brought into play in artificial combi- 
nations, schools. The school is the institution that we have developed 
in order to bring environmental forces under our control.
-P-A-G-E-97
NATURE AND NURTURE 85 
felt nobly; they have acted vigorously. The other is 
the son of an immigrant from a nation of oppression. 
His ancestors have lived in poverty; ill-nutrition has 
weakened their resistance to disease and to tyranny; 
they have gone under, one after the other, in the con- 
test with nature; they have thought in subjection; 
they have felt dully or sullenly; they have acted ab- 
jectly. Yet in the work of the school we are too prone 
_ to look for identical reactions from these two boys. 
The environment factor is subject to equal varia- 
tion. We assign the same written home-work to all the 
girls of the class. At dismissal, one of them returns to 
a home where comfort and intelligence pervade; an- 
other, to a home where poverty pinches and ignorance 
compounds the inflictions of poverty. The one girl 
spends the balance of the afternoon in healthful out- 
door play; she eats a supper of wholesome, well- 
chosen food; she goes to her own room where, free from 
interruption, with elaborate equipment at hand, — 
desk, books, paper, adequate light, etc., — she writes 
her exercise. The other girl goes from school to serious 
chores at home. She must care for infant brothers and 
sisters; she must help prepare the evening meal; she 
has but poor food, poorly cooked, and eats it in an 
atmosphere of haste, confusion, and slovenliness. 
After the meal her duties continue. Late in the even- 
ing she gets her opportunity to sit at the dining-room 
table, clearing a place for her work, and with unsatis- 
factory light, poor paper and other materials, she   
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  86 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
writes her exercise. Yet, when these two girls present 
their written work in the class the next day, it is quite 
likely that one is commended and the other disparaged 
just as though there had been a fair basis of compar- 
ison.* 
It is granted that the variations indicated are ex- 
treme, but they are by no means exceptional in the 
public schools of any of our American towns. And the 
multitude of variations of lesser range put clearly be- 
fore our teachers the lesson that we must never ignore 
the variations in these factors. Due allowance for them 
must be made in our thought, and the result will be 
subtle differences in method and attitude. It is clearly 
part of our disciplinary problem accurately to evaluate 
these variations and properly to adjust our work to 
meet them. 
Four reasons for hopefulness. Powerful for direful 
influence as are both heredity and environment, we 
have, after all, reasons to be hopeful, — at least four. 
In the first place, not all hereditary qualities are ap- 
parent at birth: that is, it is never too late to mend. 
We are not justified in despairing of any case. The 
weak-willed boy or girl may in time come into his true 
inheritance of strength. Frequently, favorable traits 
make their first appearance only upon adolescence. 
This principle has, of course, its converse side, which 
is important, but the adverse inheritance may be 
1 In this connection it may be noted that this is a strong argu- 
ment against all forms of required written home-work.
-P-A-G-E-99
  
NATURE AND NURTURE 87 
anticipated by implanting ideals which shall operate 
favorably when it comes to the front. 
In the second place, heredity usually consists of a 
general capacity and not of a specific one. We need not 
_ despair of the boy whose father is in the penitentiary 
for burglary. The father’s life may have been built 
upon weak intellect, or weak ideals, in combination 
with a strong will. The very courage needed in his 
trade may be the chief heritage which he passes on to 
his son. This we can nourish for the boy and so edu- 
cate his intellect and his feeling as to turn his will into 
legitimate and honorable channels.! 
The third principle that warrants hopefulness is the 
tendency of the individual to return to the normal. 
An exceptionally tall father, for example, will have 
tall sons, but they will probably not equal him in 
height: that is, they will also vary from the normal, 
but the variation will be of lesser degree. The other 
three fourths (Galton’s law) of their inheritance, tends 
to restore them to the normal. Thus, for the child 
whose parent is markedly weak in moral develop- 
ment, there is always the hope, amounting to an 
expectation, that he will exhibit the weakness in di- 
minished degree. 
1 That courage does not always go into conventional channels 
finds many illustrations. Among them is the story told of Thoreau, 
who permitted himself to be jailed rather than pay a tax in support 
of a government that recognized slavery. Emerson, visiting him, 
exclaimed, “Henry, why are you here?” Thoreau’s retort was, 
“Waldo, why are you not here?”
-P-A-G-E-100
  88 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
The children of the born criminal will be probably some- 
what less criminal in tendency than he, though more criminal 
than the average citizen. The children of the man of genius, 
if he has any, will probably be nearer mediocrity than he, 
though on the average possessing greater talent than the 
average citizen.! 
Lastly, the studies as to the comparative strength 
of heredity and environment in influencing the indi- 
vidual, though yielding conflicting results, seem, in 
the main, to indicate that environment has the ad- 
vantage. If this be true,? we are then fortunate in 
having as the factor that is subject to our manipulation 
the one that has the greater influence in the growth of 
the individual. 
Nature, nurture, and education. In conclusion, we 
may profitably quote a paragraph from Dr. Jordan’s 
attractive little book: — 
With the lower animals nature is everything — nurture 
a minor matter. Inadequate nurture means simply destruc- 
tion of the individual, and that to the species is a trifling 
incident. With men and with the plants and animals which 
man has made to depend on him, — and man is himself the 
most domesticated of all domestic animals, — nurture has an 
ever-growing importance. All our schools, our art, science, 
religion, have their justification as part of our nurture. Still, 
at the end nurture can only develop what was there through 
1 Caleb W. Saleeby, Parenthood and Race Culture, p. 334- 
2 Cf. L. Doncaster, Heredity in the Light of Recent Research, p. 50: 
“Little room is left in the development of the individual for the ef- 
fects of environment even on the intellect or mind in the broadest 
sense of the word; no doubt the direction which intellectual develop- 
ment takes is to a considerable extent determined by circumstances, 
but the kind of mind is irrevocably decided before the child is born.”
-P-A-G-E-101
  NATURE AND NURTURE 89 
nature, Education, training, can make nothing new, and 
neither can leave any traces we can recognize on the germs 
of life, which show their development in generations to 
come.! 
And Mr. Lee puts it well, when he says: — 
The main thing in the philosophy of to-day is the extra- 
ordinary emphasis of environment and heredity. A man’s 
destiny is the way the crowd of his ancestors ballot for his 
life. His soul — if he has a soul — is an atom acted upon by 
a majority of other atoms.?

CHAPTER XIII 
STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE INDIVIDUAL 
Phylogeny and ontogeny. We have traced hurriedly 
the successive stages by which the human race of to- 
day has evolved from the earliest forms of organic life. 
”? in dis- 
tinction from “ontogeny,” which applies to the de- 
velopment of the individual. Phylogeny deals with 
the history of the cell in the race; it traces it in its 
successive complications as it is organized into one 
after another of the various animal forms — worm, 
insect, fish, bird, mammal, to the highest, man. On- 
togeny deals with the history of the cell in the indi- 
vidual, beginning with its creation by the union of 
the two parent cells and extending to its birth as a 
completed human organism, and beyond. 
As we proceed with our study of discipline, we shall 
need to keep in mind both these phases of genesis. 
The prime reason for thinking of the two in parallel 
lines is that each — the individual and the race — is 
a key to the other. Speaking very generally, we may 
say that the child epitomizes the successive experi- 
ences of the generations of his long ancestry. Hence, 
if we would understand the unfolding of the child 
mind, we must know something of racial development. This development is known as “phylogeny, 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  DEVELOPMENT IN THE INDIVIDUAL (on 
Conversely, too, by studying the life of the child, we 
learn something of the probable characteristics of the 
race in its early development. 
Nature has few crises. Nature has few fixed points 
in development, few crises. Two stand out with partic- 
ular prominence — birth and death. Both carry with 
them an implication of finality, but it is a question as 
to whether the implication is justified. There is an 
eternity and an immortality reaching into the past; 
may there not be implied, likewise, a corresponding 
immortality reaching into the future?* 
Birth and death. Birth, after all, is not a break in 
development, but merely a continuation of growth 
under a new environment. Although we reckon our 
birthdays from a certain date, only in a limited sense 
is this accurate — we were born millenniums ago. As 
an individual creation we are born when we start on 
our own life as a separate organism, months before 
what we call birth. Birth is but a transfer of the organ- 
ism from a liquid environment to an air environment. 
May not death be but one more transfer — from this 
atmosphere to another that we do not now sense? 
The crisis of adolescence. There is, however, one 
1 Maurice Maeterlinck, The Treasure of the Humble, p. 142: 
“And, further, we know that the dead do not die. We know now 
that it is not in our churches that they are to be found, but in the 
houses, ‘the habits, of us all. That there is not a gesture, a thought, 
a sin, a tear, an atom of acquired consciousness that is lost: in the 
depths of the earth; and that at the most insignificant of our acts 
our ancestors arise, not in their tombs, where they move not, but 
in ourselves, where they always live.”
-P-A-G-E-104
‘92) DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
climax in the life of the individual that has an import 
attached neither to birth nor to death. This is the 
crisis of adolescence, the time when the individual be- 
comes able to reproduce his kind. He encounters no 
change of environment as in birth. Within and of his 
very self comes this significant accession of new func- 
tion. The spell of the self-preservative instinct is cast 
off and the reproductive instinct rushes upon him with 
forceful impact. The very delay which it has experi- 
enced seems to aggravate the fury of its force when 
once it comes into possession of the individual. 
The age of adolescence is not a fixed point through- 
out humankind. The variation in individuals extends 
several years — in general, we may say from the age 
of eleven to the age of seventeen, although excep- 
tional cases are recorded beyond each of these limits.* 
There seems to be no accepted theory as to the causes 
of this variation. Climate and race have been assumed 
to be factors affecting the age of puberty. Very prob- 
ably they do, but to what extent and in what direc- 
tion cannot be stated with any assurance. It is popu- 
larly believed that the climate of the torrid zone has 
encouraged early puberty, that the races of the warm 
lands mature early.2, Home conditions, also, such as

DEVELOPMENT IN THE INDIVIDUAL (93) 
poverty and its consequences, are probably an in- 
fluence. It has been suggested, too, that school life 
may act as a retarding force. We are sure of one factor, 
that of sex. Under like conditions, girls precede boys 
by a year or two. 
Fifteen may be taken as the normal age at which 
true adolescence begins. We must keep constantly in 
mind, however, that while life seems made up of a 
series of definite stages, continuous change is the or- 
der of the universe. Hence we are never able to say, 
Here ends childhood and here manhood begins. It 
is only as a basis of discussion, then, that we accept 
the ages which we employ as the landmarks between 
the stages of growth. We must remember that they 
represent only a general average and that each in- 
dividual has his own coefficient of variation from this 
standard. 
Probably the most definite point in all development 
is the appearance of the first catamenia. We are justi- 
fied in saying that this phenomenon marks in the girl 
the transition from infancy to youth. In the case of 
the boy, we can only guess at the corresponding crit- 
ical moment when the individual completes his era of 
preparation and appears full-armored for the service 
of the race. 
Periods in child development. Within each of the 
two large stages — infancy and adolescence — which

Infancy! is applied to the period 
from birth to the first shiftings toward 
adolescence that come two or three 
years before the pubescent climax is 
reached. It, in turn, may be divided 
into three clearly differentiated pe- 
riods: babyhood, the ascent of child- 
hood, and the plateau of childhood. 
The first of these extends through the 
first two years, while the babe is ac- 
quiring the arts of locomotion and 
language. The remaining ten years of 
childhood are marked by a break oc- 
curring at the age of eight, separating 
childhood into an early period of steady 
growth and a later period of arrest. 
Adolescence begins with the brief 
period of pubescence extending from

seems best to serve our purpose, giving greatest

the time when the child breaks away from his child- 
hood to the day of the adolescent crisis. The succeed- 
ing years of adolescence we call youth. These extend 
to the somewhat vague stage known as maturity which 
may arrive at the age of anywhere from twenty to 
thirty. 
The word of caution is again ventured that it be 
not forgotten that the ages stated are subject to the 
wide variations already noted.

  CHAPTER XIV 
INFANCY: BABYHOOD AND THE ASCENT OF 
CHILDHOOD 
Stages of infancy. The period of infancy, as we 
have seen, may be divided into three stages: the first, 
that in which the child acquires locomotion and lan- 
guage; following that, a period of steady growth; and, 
finally, a period of arrest. 
When we speak of the child’s acquiring locomotion 
and language at the age of two, we do not mean, of 
course, that he has gained an accomplished command 
of either of these arts; but at least he has begun to 
perceive their value and has entered the long period 
of learning to perfect himself in them. In school we 
do not meet the child at this stage. Nevertheless, we 
are not unconcerned as to the sort of home influences 
that have surrounded him, 
If the parents have been intelligent in their control 
and management of the child during his first two years 
they have established strongly within him the habit 
of obedience.! On the other hand, if the parents have 
been ignorant and indifferent, as is all too true in the

phers to ask him to undertake the care and education of his son. 
Said the philosopher: “ How old is he?” “Three,” replied the parent. 
The philosopher shook his head: “ You have come too late.”

majority of cases, there is placed upon the school not 
only the duty of giving the training appropriate to the 
child of school age, but also the burden of tediously 
correcting the results of error in previous treatment. 
Writing on “The First Duty of Parents,” Dr. King 
says: — 
The importance of the early years spent by the child in 
the family has long been appreciated, but even discerning 
parents have scarcely yet comprehended in what subtle 
ways the social forces of family life codperate to fix the 
fabric and texture of the child’s life or how permanent, 
withal, are the influences which operate in these earliest 
years.? 
From another angle, we are told that: — 
The progress of society depends upon getting out of men 
and women an increasing amount of the powers with which 
they are born and which bad surroundings at the start blunt 
or stupefy. This is what all systems of education try to do, 
but the result of all systems of education depends upon the 
material that comes to the educator. Opening the mind of 
the child, that is the delicate task the State asks of the 
mother, and the quality of the future State depends upon 
the way she discharges this part of her business.? 
Obedience. The rule of baby-training is exceedingly 
simple to state. Obedience should be exacted from the 
outset; no instance of disobedience should be over- 
looked. But in practice, compliance with this rule is 
difficult in the extreme even on the part of intelligent 
and self-sacrificing parents, and is practically impos-

-P-A-G-E-110
  98 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
sible on the part of ignorant and indolent parents. 
To decide what things are sufficiently important to 
demand obedience requires cool calculation and a 
sacrifice of personal interest. To secure obedience in 
every case requires infinite patience and an expendi- 
ture of valuable time. 
Therule followed will bring the child out of his baby- 
hood into his childhood, healthy, cheerful, and well 
prepared to meet the wider social life and to learn the 
requirements of social living. Unfortunately, however, 
the average child at school age has been governed by 
haphazard and probably has become a firm believer 
in the miserable idea of “government by nuisance,” 
by which he gains the things he teases for, or cries 
for, or otherwise makes a sufficiently irritating fuss for. 
The child’s early exhibitions of flagrant disregard for 
the rights of others are considered as cunning. The day 
of correction is put off and put off. In many cases this 
goes on, until at the age of fourteen or fifteen the boy 
breaks away and the father, a dozen years too late, 
tries to “thrash” him back into line. 
Training for habits. Moreover, children must re- 
ceive actual “training” in the simple habits of home 
life. Many parents think they are training their chil- | 
dren when they tell them what to do. It is not suffi- 
cient for the mother to say to the child, “You must 
brush your teeth every day.”’ Not even when she has 
added, “Here is your own little toothbrush,” has she 
trained the “ She must faithfully, day after day, 
| |
-P-A-G-E-111
  THE ASCENT OF CHILDHOOD 99 
day after day, show him exactly, in every detail, how, 
when, and where to brush his teeth, correcting his mis- 
takes and applauding his successes. Then gradually 
she leaves it to him to perform the operation un- 
prompted and unaided, but holding herself ready 
to go back to the elementary training whenever he 
lapses. 
The pupils as the school receives them. The school, 
then, receives, not children ideally fitted for the nor- 
mal progress of work, but children in various de- 
grees of adjustment to social environment. The task 
of the teacher is to build upon the work of the home. 
If the training has been intelligent, she confirms the 
good habits already acquired and establishes new ones. 
In other cases she must eradicate bad habits and false 
views and substitute a proper course of development. 
Often she does this work at great odds, continually 
handicapped by counter home influences, but, realiz- 
ing the true situation, she will not lose heart. 
Nor must the teacher go to the extreme of attempt- 
ing to repair immediately all the damage of false train- 
ing. She must be keen to appreciate the normal posi- 
tion of the child in his stage of progress. When she 
receives him he is well along in the second stage of 
infancy, that of steady growth. He is governed by 
intense desire for physical activity. He exercises 
chiefly the large and fundamental muscles. Only at 
about six does he begin to acquire control of the finer 
muscles. The teacher must remember this as the ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
    
100 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
planation of many occurrences that may have the ap- 
pearance of willful misconduct. 
The child and his childhood. Above all, the child 
is entitled to his childhood. During this entire period 
he should think and feel and act as a child, and not as 
a puppet adult. He must feel to the full the force of 
the self-preservative instinct. Say what we may in 
disparagement of self-assertion, it is from this instinct 
that the individual gains the strength and stamina 
that enables him to take and hold his place in the 
world. The child may frequently turn his self-asser- 
tion toward outside objects in a manner at variance 
with our opinions as adults, but this is not a reason 
for attempting to destroy the self-assertive instinct. 
Rather must we patiently await the time when, nor- 
mally, the onset of the reproductive instinct will give 
an altruistic impetus to his actions. Precocity of in- 
tellect may lead to expressions of feeling and will that 
appear precocious, but they are not at all likely to 
be genuine or valuable either to the child or to his 
companions. 
It has been pointed out to us! that the race has de- 
veloped mentally through the three modes of obser- 
vation and thought — mythical, historical, philosophi- 
cal. Similarly the individual thinks successively in the 
imaginative, realistic, and reflective modes. Thus we 
see the need of reaching the child through his imagina- 
tion and his sense of realism, and of not attempting to 
convince him through philosophical argument.

THE ASCENT OF CHILDHOOD 101 
Training on the intellect side. This period of in- 
fancy is the time when we teach dogmatically. We 
do it in arithmetic, in reading, in spelling, in fact in 
all the intellect side of the curriculum. The intellectual 
phase of moral action must be put before the child in 
the same spirit of dogma. We practice dogmatism 
even to the extent of teaching falsehood, as in arith- 
metic, when we say to the seven-year-old trying to 
take eight from six, “Don’t do that, you can’t take 
eight from six.” Later in his school career we teach 
him how to take eight from six, showing him that it is 
minus two. But in the mean time we have taught him 
a direct falsehood and yet we have done wisely. We 
have taught in accordance with good pedagogy, for 
it would be unwise and unprofitable for us to labor with 
him, saying, “‘There are certain times and certain con- 
ditions in which we may take eight from six. The result 
isa minus quantity. You may not be able to under- 
stand it now, so for the present do not attempt to 
take large numbers away from small ones.” How fu- 
tile it would be to argue thus with a seven-year-old 
on the philosophy of number and the use of minus 
signs. 
Child and adult points of view. Hence, in order to 
teach the child scientifically, we teach him falsehood 
in intellectual matters; and we do the same in moral 
issues. Note the dogmatism of the Ten Command- 
ments, given to the race at the early period of its 
phylogenetic development. We, too, cannot afford 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  102 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
to be other than dogmatic in our teaching of the child 
at this stage. We say to him, “You must not lie.” 
“You must not steal.” “You must not kill.” We, 
mature people, may discuss interestedly and at length 
the question as to whether it is ever justifiable to tell 
alie. Would you, for instance, tell a lie to save a life? 
Would you lie to your dying mother, if that might 
prolong her life or make her last hours more comfort- 
able? Or we may debate the question, “Is it right to 
kill?” If we may not kill, why may the nation kill? 
May we kill in self-defense? May we kill one person 
in order to save the life of another? And so on. Simi- 
larly, may we steal? If not for one’s self, then for our 
starving children? We, as adults, are qualified to dis- 
cuss all these questions. We may or may not come to 
the conclusion that the end justifies the means. 
Practically no harm can come to us as the result of 
our discussion; we are likely to go on in life with about 
the same degree of virtue as before. But it is certainly 
not safe to have these discussions with the seven-year- 
old. Shall we say to him, “You must not lie except 
under such and such circumstances,” and then philoso- 
phize with him about it? No, we must meet his con- 
dition and his needs with methods appropriate to 
them. So we say to him dogmatically and peremptor- 
ily, “You must never lie.” 
The same thing holds true for manners. The child 
does not recognize our distinction between moral re- 
quirements and the conventional requirements as to
-P-A-G-E-115
THE ASCENT OF CHILDHOOD 103 
manners. Morals and manners are all one to him. 
We are shocked if he uses his knife to transport his 
vegetables from his plate to his mouth. As a matter 
of fact there is no practical harm done. There is 
nothing intrinsically wrong in using the knife for such 
a purpose — indeed, we might admire the trick if it 
were done dexterously. We might make quite an 
elaborate study of manners and customs of eating, 
including the art of the Chinaman in using his chop- 
sticks; but to the child in his infancy, we say, 
“Never use your knife in this way,” and we give him 
this command just as dogmatically and just as auto- 
cratically as we tell him never to lie. So far as he 
knows, and so far as he needs to know for the present, 
it is just as wrong to misuse his knife as it is to lie. 
Dogmatic rules; not ethics. In other words, we do 
not discuss ethics with the child. His intellect is yet 
weak and unprepared to see all the distinctions that 
may rightfully be put before him in course of time. It 
is not that he cannot reason at this stage. Undoubtedly 
he does reason, and reasons with an excellent degree 
of accuracy. It is rather that he lacks the data of ex- 
perience. It will be a long time before he can acquire 
these data and thus be enabled to form judgments 
according to adult standards. So we teach him the 
truth as we see it or so much of the truth as he is able 
to comprehend. To attempt to teach him more would 
defeat the very object of our efforts. In these early 
years the child must defer to the intellectual authority
-P-A-G-E-116
  ;104 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
of his elders. To summarize, we give the infant dog- 
matic rules as to the intellect phase of right and wrong 
and train him to unquestioned acceptance of our au- 
thority in the matter. 
Training on the feeling side. Turning to consider 
the feeling side, we must note that throughout all 
the work of the school, we take the pupil as we find 
him and manipulate his natural interests to our pur- 
poses. His natural emotions are to be studied and 
put into service for the establishment of his ideals. 
Nor must we expect the ideals of the child, based upon 
the emotions proper to his age, to be ideals conforming 
to later adult standards. 
We cannot talk to the child, for instance, of duty as 
the summation of all spiritual interest. Nevertheless, 
we find that he already has ideals which in their es- 
sence are really high, though in their childish expres- 
sion they may seem to us less lofty. We must not 
stifle the ideal because of its peculiar expression, but 
encourage it and strengthen it. For example, a child 
has a love of the heroic. To him his father is a hero. 
Well may we pity the child of whom this is not true, 
who senses too early the fact that his father is not a 
hero. We do well if we keep that ideal before him as 
long as we can. In the mind of the normal eight-year- 
old his father can fight any other boy’s father on the 
block and “lick him,” too. We may know better, 
and we may know, too, that the father’s pugilistic 
abilities are a matter of indifference both to him and 
   
-P-A-G-E-117
*THE ASCENT OF CHILDHOOD 105 
tous. Nevertheless, it is a thing about which the 
boy is thinking and about which he cares. It is the 
same with the girl, though her ideals will differ from 
the boy’s just as the ideal mother of heroic size differs 
from the heroic father. 
Fixing ideals. To the six-year-old such verses as 
“Salute the Big Policeman” are full of significance 
and meet a response that plays its part in the fixing 
of ideals. So far as the little one is concerned, the blue 
coat and brass buttons stand only for the heroic. They 
mean for him, and they ought to mean for him, the 
brave man who rushes into the burning building and 
rescues a woman and her little ones. They picture to 
him the man who darts before the automobile and drags 
the child from under it. We say to him, “What a 
wonderful thing for the policeman to do. Isn’t he a 
brave man?” Now you and I, with our adult experi- 
ence, may not idealize the policeman quite to this 
point. We may say that he but does the thing he is 
paid to do. We may even believe that at times some 
policemen fall short of the standards of the average 
citizen, but this suspicion of ours should not find its 
way into the heart of the child. To him the policeman 
must be the hero, for we are building up in his mind 
the ideal of heroism. 
In the same way the ideal of the soldier is a potent 
one. When we say to a class, “‘ Now stand like little 
soldiers,” it puts before them a concrete concept that 
holds them to action far better than would an hour’s
-P-A-G-E-118
  106 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
talk on the philosophy of why they should behave as 
we wish them to. 
Through appeal to such natural interests the child 
gains ideals that influence him throughout life. Here 
is the place for the story.! The Ethical Culture Schools, 
New York, dealing with the child of pre-adolescent 
years, work upon the principle that 
These are the years in which he ought to assimilate the 
more important facts of the moral tradition of the past. An 
effort is therefore made to bring before him, by means of 
clear and simple lessons, the fundamental moral facts which 
are within his comprehension. By an appeal to his imagina- 
tion and to his sympathies, the child is made to share the 
lives and experiences of those personages who are the actors 
in the fairy stories, myths, fables, legends, and histories 
which are the subject-matter of instruction. . . . 
In the junior classes the teacher’s main resource is the 
power of vivid narration. After the story has been told by 
her, the children are invited to reproduce it; and this leads 
on to the discussion of the characters and their behavior. 
1 Sneath-Hodges, Moral Training in the School and Home, pp. 9, 
12: “Now, because, as a rule, the story is a spiritual creation, involv- 
ing a moral content, as is manifest in so many fairy tales, myths, 
fables, parables, allegories, legends, etc., its use becomes a peculiarly 
effective method in moral culture, and this is why the great moral 
teachers have resorted to it.” 
“Furthermore, the indirect method demands that the child be 
allowed to do his own moralizing. To tell the story and then to 
apply it in the form of preaching or exhortation, is not to be com- 
mended. The child is capable of doing his own moralizing, and this 
is much more effective than if the parent or teacher does it for him.” 
One set of “Character Building Readers” consists of stories 
graded into ten books, dealing successively with parental love, in- 
dustry, codperation and helpfulness, courage, personal responsibil- 
ity, thoughtfulness and devotion, adaptability, fidelity and justice, 
aspiration and self-reliance, self and duty.
-P-A-G-E-119
    THE ASCENT OF CHILDHOOD 107 
This discussion is initiated by the children themselves, and 
the tact of the teacher is shown in checking any tendency 
toward unsuitable discussion on the part of the more pre- 
cocious children of the class. 
Training on the will side. In this stage will cul- 
ture is a simple process. The will is under the spell 
of feeling, and if high ideals are developed the will 
will be exercised in the service of right motives. 
Special emphasis should be placed upon the physical 
basis of will, for at this period the body is peculiarly 
subject to the attacks of “children’s diseases.” Be 
sure that the child knows what is required of him for 
right living; develop within him simple concepts of the 
primary ideals and virtues; see that he gets normal 
sleep, food, and other physical care; and the innate 
will is bound to grow with vigor. 
The trials of daily adaptation to the artificial con- 
ventions of school and social life may lead to occasions 
upon which the will of the child clashes with the will 
of those in authority. In such cases there must be left 
in the child’s mind no misapprehension as to which will 
is to prevail. The teacher must have an awed realiza-

CHAPTER XV 
INFANCY: THE PLATEAU OF CHILDHOOD 
The plateau and its characteristics. The final stage 
of infancy, that of the period of arrest on a plateau, 
is one of special interest and significance. It is particu- 
larly deserving of consideration because it is the only 
period throughout whose entire extent we are sure to 
have the pupil in school. It is characterized by Dr. 
Hall ! in these words: — 
The acute stage of teething is passing, the brain has ac- 
quired nearly its adult size and weight, health is almost at 
its best, activity is greater and more varied than ever before 
and than it ever will be again, and there is peculiar endur- 
ance, vitality, and resistance to fatigue. The child develops 
a life of its own outside the home circle, and its natural in- 
terests are never so independent of adult influence. Percep- 
tion is very acute, and there is great immunity to exposure, 
danger, accident, as well as to temptation. Reason, true 
morality, religion, sympathy, love, and esthetic enjoyment 
are but very slightly developed. 
Never again will there be such susceptibility to drill and 
discipline, such plasticity to habituation, or such ready ad- 
justment to new conditions. It is the age of external and 
mechanical training. 
The boy of ten or twelve is tolerably well adjusted to the 
environment of savage life in a warm country where he could

-P-A-G-E-122
110 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
readily live independently of his parents, discharging all the 
functions necessary to his personal life, but lacking only the 
reproductive function.t 
Characteristics of the child at this period. The 
child at this age, then, is independent, sturdy, and 
self-interested. He is living more completely than 
ever under the spell of the self-preservative instinct 
and its social and adaptive corollaries. He has little 
genuine interest in adult life, because that life is based 
upon the accession of the interests flowing from the 
reproductive instinct. Adults are to him but part of 
the scenery, just as are the rocks and trees and bugs 
and birds and beasts. 
For this brief period of three or four years the child 
enjoys a life to which he can never return. He seems 
to be perfecting himself in the arts of self-protection 
and self-expression. Heis Ptolemaicrather than Coper- 
nican; at the center of the universe, and not on its 
periphery. He is egoistic and individualistic. The out- 
side world is subordinate to him, and exists only that 
it may contribute to his self-interest. The implications 
for our educational methods and our attack upon 
\ 
1 Il accounts for this period by seeing in it a memory of 
a phylogenetic era when the race rested on a “plateau” of excep- 
tional length in time. As the race has developed there has been a 
gradual advance of the age of puberty from zero to fifteen years. 
It is conceivable that there was a long period when it was, say, 
two years, another when it was three, and soon. When it reached 
eight years, the advance, according to this theory, was arrested, 
so that the period during which the race remained at this stage 
was increased far beyond the other periods of development.
-P-A-G-E-123
THE PLATEAU OF CHILDHOOD lll 
the problem of discipline are very obvious. It is pre- 
eminently the period for drill work. Now is the time 
to get the most out of the child on the formal side of 
education. We may readily teach him the formal side 
of religion, — catechism and dogma, — because he 
accepts it all as part of the drill work of the time. 
Through it he is conscious of a certain finality of 
achievement, little realizing that there is another 
function soon to come upon him. 
Discipline during this period — intellect. Consider- 
ing the discipline of the school during this plateau 
period, we take up, in turn, intellect, feeling, and will. 
On the intellect side we observe one prime essential. 
Dr. Hall makes a strong plea that we save to the child 
his childhood and prevent him from developing pre- 
cocity. The parent is apt to enjoy seeing in his off- 
spring the expression of precocity. It is a sort of 
compliment to him as a parent. But — 
To assume the responsibilities, ideas, amusements, and 
passions of adults, when character is plastic and unformed, 
gives an unconscious sense of having been robbed of the just 
rights and immunities due to childhood, and makes demands 
upon its feeble powers which cannot be met. From these 
prematurities childhood should be protected. Reflection 
should not come too soon lest the heart be poisoned by 
negations.1 
Feeling. Also, on the feeling or motive side, we 
must not endeavor to push the child beyond his 
childhood. Again, in the words of Dr. Hall — 
G. Stanley Hall, Adolescence, vol. 1, p. 384.
-P-A-G-E-124
    112 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
Something is amiss with the lad of ten who is very good, 
studious, industrious, thoughtful, altruistic, quiet, polite, 
respectful, obedient, gentlemanly, orderly, always in good 
toilet, docile to reason, who turns away from stories that 
reek with gore, prefers adult companionship to that of his 
mates, refuses all low associates, speaks standard English, 
or is pious and deeply in love with religious services as the 
typical maiden teacher or the a la mode parent wishes. Such 
a boy is either undervitalized and anzemic and precocious by 
nature, a repressed, overtrained, conventionalized manikin, 
a hypocrite, as some can become under pressure thus early 
in life, or else a genius of some kind with a little of all these.? 
The history instruction as a type. History as taught 
in the fifth and sixth school year, for example, is 
very different from the history work of the second 
cycle. We teach not causes and effects; not the phi- 
losophy of men’s actions; not the fine points of consti- 
tutional law; not the fine points of moral law. On the 
contrary, we appeal to the picturesque, to the bar- 
baric, to the elemental; and we put before the child 
a series of pictures, glowing in their warmth and color. 
We show him the famous painting of Washington 
crossing the Delaware. The impossible posture of the 
hero and its patent falsity to historic fact do not dis- 
turb him. It is dramatic and inspiring, and we do 
well to postpone the critical attitude toward it until 
a later stage in the child’s development. We let him 
reach out for his own and take it to himself, caring but 
little as to whether he has gained anything in the 
philosophy of history. 
1G. Stanley Hall, Adolescence, vol. m1, p. 453. 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
THE PLATEAU OF CHILDHOOD 113 
In this period, too, the Indian interest holds sway. 
The child is living in the Indian age. He delights to 
dress as an Indian and so we may hold before him the 
idealized Indian. Fortitude will be developed when we 
say, “Are you going to cry about a little scratch like 
that? An Indian would n’t cry out.” True, we may 
have our own ideas about the fortitude of Indians and 
may even be a little skeptical as to their traditional 
stolidity when being broiled, but it is hardly possible 
for us to over-enforce the ideal of fortitude, and so we 
are right in making the appeal that catches the child. 
A strong appeal may be made, too, to the interest 
in the conquest of nature —in getting things done, 
in fighting the elements. This is the great virtue of 
the Boy Scouts organization. Instead of the militant 
ideal — the idea of struggle against his fellows — the 
ideal put before the boy is that of successful struggle 
with himself. 
Precept and example vs. direct instruction. A word 
may be said as to the reading books which have been 
written for the express purpose of character develop- 
ment, so-called character readers, ete. Stories of 
bravery and truthfulness and of the various other 
virtues are woven together with more or less art. 
Undoubtedly, if well handled by the teacher such 
reading is of value, but there is a danger to be avoided. 
If in the reading the child detects anything approach- 
ing preachment, the result is apt to be worse than 
nothing. For instance, if we teach love for parents from 
   
-P-A-G-E-126
114 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
the reading book, there is the danger that the child 
will gather that parents are to be loved when you find 
them in the book — it is not so important when you 
live with them at home. 
So if, in a course of study, time is allotted to ethics, 
it may result in a dire loss. There is grave danger that 
if we give so many minutes a week to ethics, we neglect 
moral training all the rest of the time. There is also 
danger that the child will get into the attitude that 
here are fifteen minutes of ethics to be “put up with.” 
By precept and by example, in the everyday work 
of the school, ideals are being constantly but unos- 
tentatiously put before the child. It is our duty to 
insure that these ideals are of positive rather than of 
negative or neutral value. 
Will. On the will side we note that the child at this 
stage is really neither moral nor immoral, but rather 
unmoral. In most countries he is not considered legally 
responsible before the age of ten or twelve. It is held 
that under this age he can do no legal wrong. In creat- 
ing laws, the general trend throughout the civilized 
world is to recognize this principle more and more 
clearly. For instance, in New York no child under 
the age of sixteen can be convicted of a crime unless 
he commits such offenses as under the law are punish-> 
able by death. In other words, in reference to children, 
there is no crime — only juvenile delinquency. The 
State no longer looks upon a child offender with an 
eye for vengeance. It does not punish him by giving
-P-A-G-E-127
THE PLATEAU OF CHILDHOOD 115 
him “ten dollars or ten days.” It does say, “You are 
going in the wrong direction; you need training; we will 
train and reform you.” This position taken by the 
State gives us a hint as to our attitude in the home and 
in the school in the art of child training. Conduct 
must become a matter of acquired habit. 
Aim during this period. In conclusion, we must re- 
member that our aim is not to shorten the period of 
infancy, but rather to do all that we can to lengthen it. 
The increasing length of this period in the development 
of the race has apparently been one of the leading 
factors in its advance. The longer the period of plas- 
ticity, the longer the time in which variables from the 
normal may develop.’ It is in this stage of the plateau 
that we have the best chance of stretching out the 
infancy period. And it is our last chance, for from this 
stage the child is swept swiftly into the pubescent 
stream never to return to the days of his childhood. 
1 We are told, too, that progress is made not so much by raising 
the mass to mediocrity as by raising the individual above medioc- 
rity. This, of course, is putting the question in terms of sociology, 
and in the interest of society. We may appear to be disregarding the 
individual, but the interest of the race and of the nation seems to 
demand that we give more care to the development of the bright 
children than to the dull. This must be done in spite of the peculiar 
notions which we, as Americans, have developed concerning demo- 
cracy. Perhaps it is sufficient here to note that in our schools it is 
the bright child rather than the dull who loses as the result of mass 
teaching.
-P-A-G-E-128
CHAPTER XVI 
ADOLESCENCE 
The new growth. In order properly to understand 
the pubescent stage of development, we must pass over 
to the culminating stage, youth, and compare it di- 
rectly with the first. The final period of infancy, as 
we have seen, is a plateau, mental and physical. 
The child gains less in growth and weighs proportion- 
ately less than he did in the preceding stage, when 
growth was rapid up to the age of eight or nine. At 
adolescence, his life changes with cyclonic shock and 
growth pushes ahead again. At first the girl makes 
more rapid progress than the boy, but later the boy 
catches up. 
For the boy, and perhaps less markedly for the 
girl, this is the clumsy period. He is gawky, not know- 
ing what to do with hands or feet. Growing pains 
are frequent and real, due to unequal tension between 
bone and muscle, muscles and ligaments being strained 
because they do not grow in keeping with the bones. 
The senses become more acute. There is an increased 
sensitiveness to perfumes and color. Touch, the most 
elemental sense, the one out of which the other senses   have grown in the course of evolution, increases in in- | 
tensity. The senses, now so highly developed, must be
-P-A-G-E-129
  
ADOLESCENCE 117 
directed into channels that are not sensual, — using 
the word in its immoral content. 
New influences and conceptions. By the time the 
adolescent crisis has been reached, the youth becomes 
more readily subject to direct adult influence. This 
does not mean that he will now “do as he is told” any 
more surely than in his earlier years. It does mean, 
however, that he can enter into the mental life of 
adults about him and will yield to the influence of 
individual adults who stand to him as ideals. The boy 
is now a man among men; the girl is now a woman 
among women. Adults are to them no longer speci- 
mens of living objects, but rather egos like themselves. 
Hence, control by the adult will be through influence 
rather than through dogmatic authority. 
The youth awakes to a clearer realization of the 
paternal and filial relation. I cannot possibly convey 
to my nine-year-old the character of my affection for 
him. There is a wide difference in quality in my love 
for him and his love for me. He disposes of it in some 
such thought as this: “He loves me; he knows it; I 
know it; why talk about it?” On the other hand, I 
put into my love for the child that which he cannot 
possibly understand because it is based upon the later 
instinct, the reproductive. He does not know what it 
means to me that he is my child. So far as he under- 
stands it, children might as well come done up in 
packages and be parcel-posted to fathers and mothers. 
He has no genuine basis for the sentiment of love in its 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  118 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
higher reaches. This higher stage can come only on 
the crest of the wave of the reproductive instinct. The 
rush of the ages is in it and the youth is now prepared 
to take part in the adult life and the interaction of 
the adult forces. Now we may talk with him, man to 
man, — there is no play about it. 
New type of instruction. Pedagogy thus has its 
methods put clearly before it by the characteristics 
of the adolescent age. It is with these characteristics 
in mind that we consider intellect, feeling, and will. 
The boy or girl is ready for more formal instruction 
as to social and personal rights and wrongs and for 
more mature discussions of moral and ethical ques- 
tions. He may study such concrete illustrations as are 
to be found in Felix Adler’s The Moral Instruction of 
Children. He may ground his views as to lying and 
stealing, for instance, upon rational premises which 
he has gathered from data of experience and reflection. 
The views that he has brought with him through the 
preceding years become tempered. The heroic police- 
man becomes something besides a hero — he is a man 
like other men, appointed by his fellows as a public 
servant for their protection; and so on. It is time now 
to show that courage is not always a dramatic matter 
such as rushing into a burning building. He learns with 
Payot that “the brave man is not he who performs 
some great act of courage, but rather he who courage- 
ously performs all the acts of life.” 4 
1 Payot, Education of the Will, p. 212.
-P-A-G-E-131
  ADOLESCENCE 119 
New conceptions of the youth. The adolescent is 
ready to consider right and wrong in the spirit of 
mathematical accuracy in which Larned discusses 
it in his little book. He may profit by a more formal 
study of historic personages with the aim of deducing 
from their lives ideals for right living.? Thus, in many 
directions, his intellect will be strengthened by formal 
study of past and present events and training in the 
forming of correct judgments to be applied to new 
conditions. 
The feeling side is ready for very different treat- 
ment from that which it has been having. Taken out 
of the force and push of the oldest instinct and carried 
over to the sway of the second oldest, the adolescent 
passes from the old individualism to a new altruism. 
He is still an individual, but now an individual living 
for the race. There is now a more vivid perception of 
the golden rule. There is shifting from must to ought 
as the basis of action. There is response to the appeal 
not to live for oneself alone but unto posterity. The 
youth begins to sense the deeper meaning of parental 
affection. Before long, the appeal may be made that

graphy, prepared by James Jerry White for “The Character Devel- 
opment League,” whose object “‘is to devise the best means of train- 
ing children of the Public Schools in the principles of morality, and 
assisting them to the formation of right character, and for enlisting 
the interest and codperation of public-spirited individuals in every 
locality, to have such character teaching adopted by the local Pub- 
lic Schools.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  120 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
he judge actions in the light of their effect doll his 
children. He sees the value of team work. Codpera- 
tion means now subordination of self to community 
ideals. 
Egoism. Of course, it is not to be supposed that ego- 
ism has dropped out to any degree. Indeed, there is 
frequently a marked development in expressions of 
egoism — a certain cocksureness, an interest in dress, 
etc. But behind it are new motives, perhaps only 
slightly realized, such as never operated in the child- 
hood stage. Rawness and brashness are evidenced. 
“Youth hops an inch sideways and thinks it has leaped 
a mile ahead,” says W. J. Locke. Nevertheless, the 
youth’s eagerness to show the world how it should be 
run, is but one more evidence that he has become 
conscious of the existence of a world—a world of 
people — that is “running.” One result is that he is 
now more ready to accept the social conventions and 
ceremonies. 
The religious instinct. All religious organizations 
have realized that this is the golden age for the develop- 
ment of ideals. All make use of the phenomenon of 
adolescence. It is the time for joining the church, for 
conversion. All religious sects approach the child at 
this stage to make use of the newly awakened instincts. 
As the moral instinct is one of late development in the 
history of the race, it is natural not to expect it to 
appear in the individual until late in his development. 
The child of six may be taught to join the church; he
-P-A-G-E-133
ADOLESCENCE 121 
may be taught dogma, but there is no true reaction 
of spirit. Only at adolescence can there be true spiritual 
response. Church-workers testify that if they do not 
get the child before he is eighteen, they must wait un- 
til much later, perhaps until he is thirty, when he has 
been through the stress of doubt and indifference and 
finally returns to a more stable and more serious con- 
sideration of matters spiritual. 
The indifference of youth, of course, is not to be mis- 
taken for the maturer views of thinkers who do not 
follow the tenets of a church. There is a wide differ- 
ence, indeed, between the adolescent who dismisses the 
whole religious question as of no import to him and 
the sincere man of intellect. who terms himself an 
atheist. We are reminded of the sophomore who 
answered the appeal of the college president by say- 
ing, “Oh, I do not think about these things as you do. 
I do not believe in your religion, I am an atheist,” and 
the retort, “What, you an atheist? You do not know 
enough to be an atheist.” 
It is at this time that the ideal of duty can be ab- 
stracted from the experiences of the individual and set 
up in the heart as a motive of action. Indeed, this 
newly awakened sense of duty frequently comes on 
with such force and stress as to need the attention of 
the teacher in curbing it from excessive expression, 
particularly in the case of the adolescent girl.! 
Free choice of ideals. Through all the develop- 
1 See chapter x1, author's Problems of the Elementary School.  
-P-A-G-E-134
  122 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL sei 
ment of new ideals and strengthening of old, we must 
be careful to leave the child in entire freedom. That 
is, his ideals must be freely chosen by himself because 
they appeal to that which is within him. We do not 
exhort; we do not urge; but we put clearly and force- 
fully before him the various possible ideals, and our 
art consists in so presenting them by exposition and 
by example that he is constrained to choose the higher. 
Our aim is to pass over to the pupil himself the impulse 
to high conduct which heretofore we have, rather, 
forced upon him. We are helping him to come into 
his inheritance of himself; for, as optimists, we must 
believe that within him there is something worthy 
which he may reasonably hope to reach. 
New opportunities for will training. In guiding the 
will at this stage, we have a larger opportunity for 
genuine will training than heretofore. As always, the 
will is the instrument of feeling. As ideals become 
heightened and based more upon individual choice, 
there is a better motive behind the will. The youth 
may now be interested in the problem of will control 
as applied to himself. He himself becomes to himself 
an interesting problem, and may be given deliberate 
exercise in will control. 
The problem may be introduced in some such way 
as this: For some time, Tony has been misbehaving 
in the class. Finally, in quiet and personal confidence 
you say to him: “I know a person whom I wish I 
could put in charge of you, Tony. He would make you
-P-A-G-E-135
ADOLESCENCE 123 
behave. It would not take him long to set you straight 
and make you study. Do you know whom I mean?” 
His first guess is probably “The principal?” “No.” 
“My father?” “No.” “Who?” “Tony. Nobody 
can really take care of you now, but yourself.” Thus 
you refer him back to what must be throughout his 
life the real leader, himself. The teacher’s spirit is, 
“Heretofore I have been managing you; now it is 
your turn to manage yourself.” 
One secret of success in will training is the recogni- 
tion of the probability of failure. After all, one hundred 
per cent perfection in the conduct of school children 
cannot be beautiful because it cannot be natural or 
true. Failure is to be recognized as a natural thing. It 
is not the immediate conquest of failure that is to be 
expected, but the progressive elimination of it as will 
training proceeds. One of the rare opportunities of 
the classroom is to show the boy or girl the lines along 
which he must work in order to improve his own will 
power. Above all, we must remember that moral ma- 
turity develops later than intellectual maturity. This 
is the experience of the race. It is likewise the experi- 
ence of the individual. 
The transitional pubescent stage. Consideration of 
the pubescent stage has been postponed because with- 
out a knowledge of the life which precedes and follows 
it the intermediate stage cannot be understood. John 
Bigelow in his speculation on Sleep looks upon dream- 
ing as a short intermediate stage between sleep and
-P-A-G-E-136
  124 DISCIPLINE AS AN doodles PROBLEM 
awakening, having in it the elements of both condi- 
tions. His simile is that of swimmers just emerging 
from the water. They stand partly in the new atmos- 
phere while there still clings to them the dripping ele- 
ment of the old. Dreams, he claims, take place at this 
transition stage. 
Using the same figure, we may picture the pubescent 
child as a dreamer. He has foreshadowings of the post- 
pubescent stage but it is without conscious meaning 
to him. He is struggling out of the infancy stage with- 
out knowing what his struggle is about. He resents 
the past, but is not yet ready for the atmosphere of the 
future. It is perhaps the most difficult time in the 
whole career of the individual, and by consequence it 
presents the most difficult problems to the teacher. 
Every teacher of the fourth and fifth, and even of the 
sixth, year grades can testify to this. Treatment of 
the most delicate character is required. The child 
needs mothering, yet resents it when he gets it. And 
still he needs it. There is uncertainty and conflict on 
the physical side, there is a marked acceleration ff 
height and weight. It is as though nature were giving 
one great final push in hurling the individual over the 
chasm from childhood to youth. It is the age of marked 
increase in criminal tendency, which crops out fre- 
quently in such expressions as vagrancy es 
thefts. In fact, it is claimed that from two 6; three _ at ie 
times as much incorrigibility_occurs-between the ages i 
Sted teenie vintnone . 
of 13 and 16 as at any other period of life.   7
-P-A-G-E-137
  ADOLESCENCE 125 
The teacher must respect the fact of growth. There 
are many chances to go wrong on all sides, intellect, 
feeling, and will. On the intellect side, the teacher’s 
problem is to make the transition gradually but surely 
from dogmatic to reasoning teaching. Feeling is af- 
fected through the tendency of the nervous system 
to act irregularly, with the result that emotional 
sensitiveness degenerates. The boy’s ideal may be 
that of a loafer on the corner and this ideal may be to 
him as impelling as a sense of duty. He is living both 
lives, forward and backward, and his teachers must 
nourish his ideals very carefully. They have to watch, 
too, the natural development of his will and at just the 
proper moment and in the proper degree turn the 
authority from without to within. 
By way of conclusion of our brief consideration of 
the stages of development, we may say that it seems 
clear that the teacher must first of all respect the fact 
of growth. The first question that should arise in her 
mind in a “case” of discipline is, “‘ What is the natural 
age of the pupil?” She must know the location of the 
pupil in the ontogenetic scale, remembering, too, that 
it is not safe to depend upon chronological age alone. 
Standing out of the way of nature. In general terms, 
we may say that in infancy we develop instincts into 
individuality through a selective process by which we 
minimize those that are harmful and retain and re- 
inforce those that are valuable; in infancy and in 
pubescence, we establish habits of good conduct; in
-P-A-G-E-138
  126 DISCIPLINE AS AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM 
adolescence we attempt to fix the higher ideals toward 
which we have been leading the individual through 
his previous years. Through it all we may well re- 
member that when the child does the things that are 
annoying to us, that contravene the tenets of our theo- 
ries, he is, after all, doing only that which the race did 
in the course of its development. So we have always 
the cheering hope that he, like his race, will grow into 
civilization in due course of time. “Biological educa- 
tion demands, as its first principle, that we stand out 
of the way of nature and allow it to have its own way 
with the child. It declares that the great need of the 
whole period of development of the child is to live out 
each stage, lingering in that stage as though it were 
to be the last.” !

CHAPTER XVII 
PSYCHOLOGY OF CLASS CONTROL 
Transition from individual to class. Up to this point 
our discussion has chiefly concerned discipline as ap- 
plied to the individual, either in the home or in class. 
With this background, we now study the psychology 
of class control. It might appear that, as a class of 
fifty is a group of fifty individuals, the control of this 
class is nothing more than the control of fifty indi- 
viduals, and that the sole psychology to be considered 
in that control is the psychology of the individual. 
This, however, is far from the truth. The class is not 
merely the sum of fifty individuals. It is fifty indi- 
viduals plus a certain atmosphere that comes with 
a crowd. 
One pupil is one individual; add one pupil and we 
have a group of two. But we have now more than 
the two problems represented by the sum of the two 
pupils, individually. So soon as the individual one 
becomes the class two, there arises a new and com- 
plicated problem, — the class problem. For instance, 
if the teacher detains one pupil for a breach of discip- 
line a half-hour after the school session, the detention is 
likely to be areal punishment to him. He hears noth- 
ing but the scratch of the teacher’s pen as she busies
-P-A-G-E-142
    180 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
herself with her records. He is practically marooned 
with his own thoughts. Whatever notions of insub- 
ordination he may have are unsupported. The teacher 
is an effective representative of concrete authority. 
But add one pupil, and we have a crowd. Immedi- 
ately a different atmosphere is created. ‘‘ Misery likes 
company”; and, no matter how far from each other 
the two pupils may be seated, a certain telepathy is 
established between them. The punishment shared 
becomes less a punishment. The teacher is now not so 
much the representative of authority as the subject 
of resentful attention by the two pupils in sympathy 
with each other. Add two more pupils to the group and 
effective punishment is practically eliminated. Though | 
there may be four corners in the room, and one pupil 
in each corner, there are not, after all, enough corners 
in which to pocket the offenders beyond the sense of 
comradeship in distress. 
Social nature of the class. The class is a social 
microcosm. As such, it is a valuable instrument in the 
process of education. The child is naturally a social 
creature, working with pleasure and vim when asso- 
ciated with other children. Helpfulness and the other 
social virtues are to be learned through the codperative 
work of the class. Nevertheless, the teacher must 
thoroughly understand the class as a class, and must 
master the technique of class control. The problems 
created by the creation of the class are many. New 
ideals of conduct are introduced. Artificial school
-P-A-G-E-143
  
PSYCHOLOGY OF CLASS CONTROL = 131 
conventions are added to the ordinary rules govern- 
ing individual life. Many of the regulations necessi- 
tated by the regular work of a class do not apply to an 
individual at similar tasks. “Whispering,” for in- 
stance, one of the cardinal sins in the usual class, 
would be an inoffensive amusement when indulged 
by a boy sawing wood. 
The class vs. the gang. The teacher has before her 
the phenomenon of “the crowd” and must apply the 
psychology of the crowd. The crowd is not “the gang.” 
A gang and a class are both forms of crowd, but the 
crowd that the teacher faces is the class and not the 
gang. The chief distinction is that the gang gathers 
by its own choice; the class is gathered by accident 
so far as the individudls composing it are concerned. 
There is design on the part of the school authorities 
in gathering the class together, but it is on a basis en- 
tirely foreign to the anticipations of the child, a basis 
unrecognized by him in the outside life which, to him, 
is the real life. The fact that his fellows are at the 
same stage in ability to solve book problems in arith- 
metic or to read the same words in a reader, does not 
appeal to the average boy or girl as a natural or valid 
basis for consorting together. Were you to let your 
school loose, the children would never group them- 
selves according to ingenuity in diagraming complex 
sentences. On the contrary, they recognize a certain 
natural peerage, unrelated to school standards. 
The gang, as is readily understood, dates back to  
-P-A-G-E-144
  132 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
the gregarious instincts originating in the animal stage. 
Its extreme age gives it extreme force. Boys, like their 
elders, gather naturally into groups, based upon these 
instincts of gregariousness. The gang may not — in 
fact, usually does not — gather for a specific purpose, 
but merely to satisfy this innate yearning for compan- 
ionship. Although it congregates in advance of the 
formulation of any specific purpose, once gathered, it 
follows vagarious and shifting aims in leading the life 
of the gang. One night its controlling ideal may be to 
make a record in the number of ash-cans it can upset. 
The next night it is “shooting-up” a moving-picture 
hall. On a third, it may even follow some altruistic 
aim, such as helping one of its own members to make 
a “clean get-away” from the arm of the law. 
The class, on the other hand, is gathered for a pur- 
pose, not inherent in the class itself but formulated by 
governmental authority. This distinction is to be kept 
in mind, and with it, too, the fact that a gang may 
become part of a class or that a class may develop into 
a gang, each of which conditions requires its own 
treatment. 
Class and crowd psychology. The psychology of the 
class as distinguished from that of the individual has 
not, in pedagogic literature, been given the prominence 
it merits. It is not attempted here to work out this 
philosophy with any aim toward completeness, but 
merely to set forth such elementary principles as may 
be applicable to the teacher’s problem. We are in-
-P-A-G-E-145
  PSYCHOLOGY OF CLASS CONTROL = 133 
debted to LeBon ! for elucidation of the psychology 
of the crowd. He establishes certain generalizations 
which may be borrowed for classroom use. 
From the outset, we must bear in mind one point 
which LeBon makes, namely, that the crowd is not 
necessarily bad. It is composed not of the good or of 
the bad, but of all sorts. It may, too, be either better 
or worse than the individual, according to the circum- 
stances. Sometimes it is criminal, as when it fights just 
authority; sometimes it is heroic, doing things which 
its individual components could not or would not have 
done alone. 
On the intellect side, the crowd is inferior to the 
individuals of whom it is composed. It is little inclined 
toreason. It is borne along by the current, and its 
successive susceptibilities are deepened by the suc- 
cessive movements. The class as a crowd has its own 
entity, and is subject to the law of mental unity. It 
seems to have a mind ? of its own, and this mind is 
1 Gustave LeBon, The Crowd, A Study of the Popular Mind. 
The book is in three parts: — 
I. The Mind of Crowds. 
II. The Opinions and Beliefs of Crowds. 
Til. Kinds of Crowds. 
2 Gustave LeBon, The Crowd, p. 6: “The most striking peculi- 
arity presented by a psychological crowd is the following: Whoever 
be the individuals that compose it, however like or unlike be their 
mode of life, their occupations, their character, or their intelligence, 
the fact that they have been transformed into a crowd puts them 
in possession of a sort of collective mind which makes them feel, 
think, and act in a manner quite different from that in which each 
individual of them would feel, think, and act, were he in a state of 
isolation.”
-P-A-G-E-146
184 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
neither the sum nor the average of the minds of the 
individuals. 
On the feeling side, we note the anonymity of the 
crowd which results in the disappearance of the in- 
dividual sense of responsibility. For example, a re- 
spectable and law-abiding farmer hears a dozen of his 
neighbors rushing past his house. He hurriedly joins 
them and soon is lost in the crowd that quickly gathers. 
It seems that the crowd is in hot pursuit of a man who, 
it thinks, has committed a crime. Now, under no 
circumstances, would our particular farmer, as an in- 
dividual, pull the rope that would hang a man. The 
thought of his reputation, to be handed down to pos- 
terity, as well as his self-respect, would keep him from 
doing such a thing. It would be a shocking offense 
to his ideals. But in this case the rope is pulled by 
the crowd, and he lends a hand. The crowd is tempo- 
rarily a unit and the responsibility is upon this unit 
as awhole. Presently the crowd disperses. The crowd 
responsibility is shattered, and the farmer, very likely 
deeply contrite, returns to his individual life. 
The child at home, and in class. Here is a vital point 
not realized by parents or by the theorists who have 
never had the experiences of the teacher. No matter 
how much one has studied the subject theoretically, if 
he has never stood before a class in lonesome author- 
ity, he cannot possibly know or guess anything about 
the actual conditions. 
The parent, for instance, says in all sincerity, “My
-P-A-G-E-147

boy was reported for doing such and such; but I am 
sure he never did it; he never could have done it, for 
he does not behave like that at home.” True enough, 
he would not have done so had he been at home or 
if he had been receiving individual instruction; but 
the parent does not know him, and would not recognize 
him, as a member of a crowd. As such, the boy has 
been temporarily out of his mind.1 At home, reason 
reasserts itself and by this time, very likely, he gen- 
uinely thinks that he did not do that with which he 
has been charged. He has been subject to the psy~ 
chology of the crowd. 
The little one starts off for school in the morning 
confidently determined to do all that is right and 
good. The parting injunction from his mother is, 
“Now, be a good boy all day.” As he kisses his mother 
good-bye, promising to heed her, he really means to 
keep the promise, and the mother fondly assumes 
that he will do so. But when he reaches the school he 
finds that his own teacher is not present, and that 
the class is in the hands of a tyro-substitute. Through 
the incompetency of the teacher, the class is early 
converted into a mob and the boy is swept out of him- 
self, becoming helpless in the current of the class. 
The class as a whole does things which he, as an indi- 
vidual, would not think of doing. But he feels that 
1 Gerald S. Lee, Crowds, p. 288: “Even a gentle soul like Paderew- 
ski, full of a personal and strong beauty that he could lend to every- 
thing he touched, finds himself swept out of himself at last by the 
huge undertow of crowds.”
-P-A-G-E-148
186 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
there is a certain something which he owes to the class 
that means that he should get in and help. So he takes 
part in the doing of things which he would in no way 
endorse if it were his own personal problem. When he 
returns: home he is quite ready to declare to his 
mother that he has kept the promise of the morning. 
The difficulty is that the teacher cannot explain to the 
mother that both school and mother are right and that 
a proper estimate of the little one is a joint estimate. 
Failure to understand the psychology of the crowd 
frequently leads the student of child behavior to erro- 
neous conclusions. Much of our educational theory 
originates in the psychological laboratory, where the 
individual is the unit. The psychologist studies the 
individual child, gathers his data, and draws his infer- 
ences. Then he makes sweeping generalizations which 
he assumes apply to a class in the schoolroom. What 
the student has learned may be true for one child, 
but he has not learned to know the children of a class. 
Allied to this is the failure to recognize the invalidity 
of much of children’s testimony. School people and 
others waste a lot of time in taking the testimony of 
children. 
The contagion of the crowd. Another phenomenon 
of the crowd is the rapid contagion of sentiment, the 
individual sacrificing his personal interest to the col- 
lective interest. This is related to the question of 
fatigue. One can walk farther in company than alone. 
One can march farther to music than without. The
-P-A-G-E-149
ee 
PSYCHOLOGY OF CLASS CONTROL = 137 
crowd, like Bacon’s friendship, “redoubleth joys, and 
eutteth griefs in halves.” Bating a teacher, in a crowd, 
is an overwhelming joy that would lack zest if a 
lonely boy were attempting it; being punished for the 
offense has little of the sting in it if the boy is not 
the sole offender. 
As to will, the individual becomes an automaton 
who has ceased to be controlled by his own will, and 
who is carried by the will of the crowd. We have 
already noted that the will of the individual is more 
or less dependent upon the factor of physical condi- 
tion. The crowd creates a certain stimulating phy- 
sical environment which reacts upon each individual 
of the crowd. Noise and light have their effect. 
People visit Coney Island or the Midway and lose 
themselves in the crowd spirit. The glare and the 
noise contribute to create an atmosphere that sub- 
merges the will of the individual in that of the crowd. 
People, as we say, “get on edge,” and this state leads 
to a breaking down of their judgment. So, the slogan 
of “Everybody ’s doing it” carries them to extremes of 
conduct. 
Application to class control. Having this brief 
summary of the psychology of the class as distin- 
guished from that of the individual, it remains to apply 
it to the general problem of class control by the teacher. 
First of all it is to be noted that there is a class spirit, 
whether it is for or against the purpose of the school. 
The task of the teacher then is not to create a class
-P-A-G-E-150
  
  188 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
spirit, but to mold, direct, and nourish the existing 
spirit, to the proper ends of the school. The teacher 
arranges the properties on the stage, and, with the 
scene favorably set, merely gives the pupils their 
cues for proper action. 
The teacher will do well to assume that the class is 
with her.! It is true that many a young teacher, as- 
suming this attitude, grows somewhat wiser before the 
day is over. Her difficulties, however, are due to her 
lack of skill in getting right to work at the start. From 
the opening moment of the day, the spirit of work 
must pervade the class. The spirit of fun has its place, 
but it is to be indulged only after the spirit of work 
has been thoroughly established. 
The pupil must come to see that it is a privilege to 
work and to learn how to work. We are here in the 
class — as we are here in life — to do something for 
ourselves and for our fellows. We work on a given task 
until we have grown so big that it is no longer a task. 
Then we take something bigger to work on, and, con- 
tinuing, “build more stately mansions” of the soul. 
The ideal condition, then, is that of the class work- 
ing concentric about the teacher. The teacher will lead 
the leaders, and, as the work progresses, will fre- 
1 The pupils will soon deal with the timid, hesitating teacher 
in a way to convince her that her forebodings of disaster were cor- 
rect. It is analogous to the situation portrayed by Guyau, in his 
Education and Heredity, p. 28: “ When a man, followed by a vaguely 
-threatening crowd, musters up courage to face it, and suddenly 
cties, ‘You want to hang me, do you?’ there is every chance that 
they will immediately apply the formula he has found for them.”
-P-A-G-E-151
  
PSYCHOLOGY OF CLASS CONTROL 139 
quently resign in favor of the pupil when competent 
leadership has been developed. 
Bad class spirit. Class spirit may, however, take a 
direction antagonistic to the school such as to make 
the class not only a crowd buta “mob.” Sometimes the 
teacher, and sometimes, too, the principal, is not aware 
of the fact that this is the situation. If the class is 
actually a mob, a peculiar problem exists. It is a prob- 
lem primarily for the principal. His first duty is to 
break up the mob, to reorganize the group. For ex- 
ample, there may be, in a city school, two or more 
classes of 4B grade. If one of these has had a substi- 
tute teacher for a month or two and the mob spirit 4 
has developed, when the new teacher takes the place 
of the substitute the mob must be broken up by a re- 
distribution of the pupils among the classes in the 
grade. The other teachers involved may not like 
this disposition, but it is necessary because the mob 
spirit cannot be permitted to grow in the school. 
Subduing the mob spirit. The problem of the 
teacher who goes to a class is different from that of the 
teacher whose class comes to her. If she already has 
influence in the school and is respected by the pupils 
outside of her own room, her position in taking hold 
1 John Galsworthy, in his play, The Mob, puts scorching words of 
condemnation in the mouth of his hero: “ You — Mob —” he says 
— “are the most contemptible thing under the sun. When you walk 
the street — God goes in. . . . You are the thing that pelts the weak; 
kicks women; howls down free speech. This to-day and that to- 
morrow. Brain — you have none. Spirit — not the ghost of it!”
-P-A-G-E-152
  140 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
of a new class is easy. The class that comes to her 
by regular promotion is presumably well organized, 
comes in the right spirit, and will be readily handled. 
But if the teacher goes to a new class in the middle of 
the term, — to a class, for example, that has been un- 
der an incompetent teacher, — she has a very different 
problem before her. She must consider whether she 
is facing a class that has a proper class spirit or a mob 
spirit. In the latter case, the ordinary rule to follow 
is to reduce the class to its component individuals. 
Each individual pupil must be impressed with the fact 
that the teacher is concerned with him. Under such cir- 
cumstances, it would pay the teacher to spend five 
hours a day out of school visiting the parents of her 
pupils, until she had made the round of the homes of 
every member of the class. 
Any class, under any circumstances, profits by being 
treated in this way. The able teacher gives the im- 
pression to all of the members of the class that each 
one of them is receiving almost her undivided atten- 
tion. For example, at the beginning of a session the 
class should not tumble into the room and amuse them- 
selves as they please until a certain bell rings as a 
signal for beginning work. From the time a pupil en- 
ters the room, he should feel that for him the day’s 
work has begun. 
Leading the leaders. This is the opportunity for the 
new teacher with her new class. It is her business to 
catch each individual as he enters. ““Here, Mike,” she
-P-A-G-E-153
PSYCHOLOGY OF CLASS CONTROL 141 
says, “this is your work.” There is immediate recog- 
nition that Mike figures as an individual, not as a 
part of a mob. The same with Sadie and Claude and 
the rest of the individuals as they arrive. Each is put 
to his work and care is taken to see that each is doing 
the work that has been assigned him. The class, as 
we have noted, is equal to the sum of the individuals 
— plus. When there is a mob class or even the fear of 
the class becoming a mob, reduce the class to the sum 
of the individuals. That is, the teacher must take 
away the plus that has accrued in the formation of the 
class. She will discover the leaders, lead the leaders,! 
get the strong-willed pupils around her, and through 
them control the entire class. 
1G. Stanley Hall, Adolescence, vol. 1, p. 404: “The incor- 
rigible often seeks the society of younger children, whom he domi- 
nates, because he has a new passion for leadership which the teacher 
ghould give better direction. The instinct to be an initiative power 
ueeds appreciation.”

  CHAPTER XVIII 
THE TEACHER AS DISCIPLINARIAN: THE PHYSICAL 
EQUIPMENT 
The teacher the center. The teacher is the center 
of the class and the. responsibility for the class discip- 
line rests with her. It is imperative that she herself 
shall realize this. I well remember a young teacher, 
full of confidence and even assurance, who at the end of 
the first hour with her class, came to my office and said. 
“Well, I have failed.” I asked her whose fault it was. 
She thought for a moment and then replied, “My own; 
it could not have been the boys, and there was nobody 
else there; so it must have been mine.” Needless to. 
say, this teacher reached an early success, owing in 
large measure to her honest and vivid recognition of 
her own responsibility for what went on in her class. 
The teacher, then, as a factor in discipline, must be 
considered both as to her personal qualifications and 
as to her official position in the classroom. Consider- 
ing her personal qualifications, we remember that the 
teacher, like other individuals, is the product of her 
heredity and environment. She brings to her position 
an inherited physical and mental make-up, together 
with such improvements upon the same as may have 
accrued through her general scholastic and profes-
-P-A-G-E-155
  ‘THE TEACHER’S PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT 143 
sional training. Her personality, including both her 
physical and mental equipment, is her “stock in trade.” 
Physical equipment and tone. As to physical equip- 
ment, natural features codperate to make the teacher 
what she is. Chief among these are health, voice, ex- 
pression, and carriage. The fundamental requirement 
for the teacher is physical tone. A sickly teacher can- 
not manage a class successfully. There must be a cer- 
tain vigor and verve brought into every day’s work. 
Lack of this does not always impair class control 
in the popular sense of the word, but it inevitably 
impairs development of atmosphere and spirit in the 
class. 
The teacher must start each fresh day with fresh 
vigor. “Only a teacher that becomes enthusiastic over 
his subject can communicate that sense of life and 
warmth to his pupil which is necessary for fruitful 
coéperation of teacher and pupil.” ! The teacher’s 
work must always appear to have what the present- 
day enthusiasts call “the punch.” “Appear to have” 
is used designedly, for of course no teacher will have 
the constant unfailing supply of energy to make every 
day in the year genuinely full of a maximum of en- 
ergy. But even when the teacher is not feeling at her 
best she should do what she can to deceive the class so 
that they will think that there is no place she would 
rather be than here doing this work at this time. If 
the teacher must choose between maintaining tone 
1 Hermann Weimer, The Way to the Heart of the Pupil, p. 25. 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
    
144 +DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
and adding to her preparation for the day’s work on 
the scholastic side, she does wisely to conserve tone 
even at the expense of perfection of method. A strong, 
life-expressing teacher, using methods just a little less 
finished, will make better headway with a class than 
the sickly teacher who, in general terms, is following 
a perfect method. 
Maintaining good tone. There are many considera- 
tions furthering the maintenance of good tone. Re- 
laxation and exercise are two forms of gaining recre- 
ation. The teacher must study herself to know which 
of these two is the more re-creating for her and which 
of these will be the more helpful at a particular time. 
The new American free spirit tempts one to overdo 
the exercise phase. Often, what is needed is not exer- 
cise, but rest. It is not accurate to say that change of 
work is rest, although this is one of the euphemisms 
that has grown pretty deep into our speech. The 
teacher must develop a wholesome view of life in 
general. She cannot afford to give way, more than 
momentarily, to the depression that naturally follows 
some of the phases of the work of the school day. 
The teacher must learn to go back often to original 
sources. She will free herself from the details of her 
work and reach out to those fundamental things which, 
for her, are the real and helpful things of life. She 
will have, let us hope, a resourceful philosophy, or a 
sustaining religious inspiration, or a certain attuneness 
with nature; or perhaps it is in the literature of the
-P-A-G-E-157
  THE TEACHER’S PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT 145 
ages that she finds relief and content. She should 
have some refuge to which she may retreat, some 
mountain-top which she may ascend and from which 
she may look down upon the larger world and regain 
her sense of proportion. 
Leaving school worries behind. Above all, the 
teacher must be careful not to take school with her 
when she finishes the work of the day. She is in a bad 
state if she gets to the point where she is eating, drink- 
ing, sleeping, and living school. This does not mean 
that the teacher shall not spend time in study and 
reading along professional lines. Indeed, if she has 
the right spirit toward her work she may occasionally 
read a professional book and get from it a renewal of 
vitality. There are a few pedagogic books through 
which teachers of a certain temperament may be re- 
vitalized as by the reading of a poem. These people 
may safely indulge at times in such a stimulus, but 
no one should become intoxicated on pedagogic litera- 
ture. One must not get too much of pedagogic theo- 
rizing into one’s system. 
After two or three years of experience, the teacher 
ought to be able to adjust her school work in such a 
way that practically all of her hours after school are 
free from school drudgery. To read a book on the 
philosophy of education, by some author of force, may 
be relaxing at times when reviewing a set of composi- 
tion papers would be extremely taxing. The teacher 
has her troubles throughout the school day, and those
-P-A-G-E-158
  146 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
troubles should be left behind when she leaves the 
school building. Going over a set of compositions, for 
instance, brings back to mind the difficulties and per- 
plexities that have been connected with each particular 
pupil all day long. It is quite sufficient strain on one’s 
vitality to meet the situations as they develop through 
the day. It is folly to give out more energy over the 
same matter by retrospection in the evening. It is 
much better to substitute a hearty two hours of en- 
joyment at the theater, or under the nes or in other 
companionship.* 
The voice as a tool. Many a teacher does not realize 
what a wonderful equipment she has in health and 
personal qualifications. Her personality is her tool- 
chest, and its various attributes are the tools of her 
trade. It behooves her to keep these tools in working 
condition and to learn to use them with consummate 
skill. Among these pedagogic tools, the voice is not 
the least important. To serve as a good tool it need 
not necessarily be musical. Nor are we to think of the 
1 The teacher should have her avocations. “It is almost uni- 
versally true that those who have done the world’s best work have 
had some secondary interest to turn to for change and recreation. 
The great teacher, the good teacher, should not be an exception. 
Let that interest be drawing or painting, music, mechanics, design- 
ing, writing, or nature study, but let it be something. The indi- 
vidual without interest is bound to be uninteresting, and no one in 
the teaching business, who entertains hope of success, can afford 
to be that for one instant.” (Florence Milner: The Teacher, p. 37). 
This quotation is from a book that should be helpful to every 
teacher. Among its chapters are those dealing with such topics as 
“Why does one teach ?”; “Life outside of School”; “Personality 
and Poise”; “Tact.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
THE TEACHER’S PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT 147 
pedagogic voice as merely the quiet voice. We have 
grown accustomed to think of the “‘teacher’s voice” 
in its disparaging sense as the voice of one who raves 
and rants at her class. Hence we are apt to rate as 
a satisfactory voice that of any teacher who does not 
thus offend. 
It is true that some teachers seem to think that the 
way to control a noisy class is to out-noise it. Such a 
practice cannot be condemned too strongly. Never- 
theless, there are times when the sharp decisive tone 
is the one to use. There come times for righteous in- 
dignation, and there is need for the voice that can go 
off like a shot at the right moment. Needless to say 
that if a teacher keeps up a voice bombardment, her 
pupils in the course of a half-hour will probably be 
unconscious of what she is saying. Children, like 
others, are susceptible to the modulations of voice, and 
the skillful teacher holds the attention of her class with- 
out asking for it. When attention is beginning to lag, 
she may lower her voice; she may talk along for a few 
minutes in the same tone, then lower it suddenly, 
change its quality or its quantity, and get commensu- 
rate effects. 
In other words, the teacher will use her voice like 
any other tool, purposefully. Before speaking she will 
know what she expects to gain by speaking, and hence 
how she will use her voice to accomplish her purposes. 
In this, as in every other phase of her work, the teacher 
seeks to become the artist. She works toward the time
-P-A-G-E-160
a rene. a eae 
1448 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
when this bending of the voice to the purpose of the 
moment ceases to be a matter of conscious selection. 
Expression; personal touch. Under the term “ex- 
pression,” we may include all of those combinations 
of eye, smile, gesture, etc., which the teacher may 
employ. By skillful use of these the teacher secures 
rapport with her class, and particularly with the in- 
dividuals of the class. She has little quiet understand- 
ings with each pupil, even to the point of giving 
an appreciative wink in the direction of the boy who 
catches some point in a lesson that is missed by, the 
others in the class. The boy thus dealt with, sensing 
that he is the intimate of the teacher, is controlled as 
he would not be if his individuality were lost within 
the class. 
Teachers should avoid overworking the voice. 
The smile of appreciation often serves as satisfac- 
torily as the commendatory speech. The glance of 
condemnation takes the place of verbal reprimand. 
The quiet gesture is as effective as the spoken com- 
ment. Teachers are apt to think that the only way to 
regain wavering attention is to stop the work in hand 
and talk about attention. It is dangerous to attempt 
to follow a fallacious counsel of perfection in this mat- 
ter of attention. In the course of the presentation of 
a lesson, if attention wavers, it is better to let one, 
two, or more pupils, say up to ten per cent of the class, 
go, and hold the attention of the ninety per cent, than 
to let go of the ninety per cent in an effort to reclaim
-P-A-G-E-161
  
THE TEACHER’S PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT 149 
the ten per cent. The wavering attention of the indi- 
vidual is often to be regained by covert treatment, as, 
for instance, an aside remark to him which does not 
at all interrupt the course of the class work, skillful 
questioning which throws responsibility upon him, the 
quiet message by eye or gesture, or a written note. 
Carriage and dress. Under “carriage” may be in- 
cluded all that has been said under the other categories 
of health, voice, and expression. Under this heading, 
too, the teacher’s dress may be considered. ‘‘Clothes 
do not make the man,” says the pork-packer in his 
letters to his son, “but they make ninety per cent of 
him during business hours, and it is well that he should 
give some attention to them.” Appropriate dress has 
its effect upon the sales of the commercial traveler 
and the success of the business executive; it is scarcely 
less a factor in the control of children by the teacher. 
The teacher who appears before the children in 
clothes plain and severe in style is failing to make 
use of one of the elements of her equipment. If she 
appears dull and colorless before her class, her whole 
personality is affected and her work is robbed of a cer- 
tain vividness which it might otherwise have. The 
general appearance of the teacher is a silent and effec- 
tive influence, even though the children may be quite 
unable to analyze it and even unconscious of its specific 
quality. Wise is the teacher who, as she dresses for the 
day, considers the kind of a day it is likely to be. The 
little touch of color that she dons to offset the dreary 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  150 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
cloudiness of a January morning, will have its effect on 
all the work of the day. This, too, is aside from the 
importance of the teacher’s appearing before her chil- 
dren as a standard, if not an ideal, in the matter of 
taste, appropriateness, and neatness of dress. 
The externals as aids to control. That all of these. 
elements concerned with the personality of the teacher 
are effective with pupils is evidenced by general ob- 
servation, and by specific studies of the working of the 
child’s mind. In his A Study in Moral Education, J. R. 
Street says: “It is worthy of note that what attracts 
the pupils is the externals. Voice, dress, good looks, 
manners, religious activity far overtop the deeper 
moral elements”; although as he continues, “these 
would be of but little avail did not a teacher possess 
a personality whereby love, obedience, and respect 
may be inspired.” 1

CHAPTER XIX 
THE TEACHER AS DISCIPLINARIAN: THE 
MENTAL EQUIPMENT 
Tues teacher’s mental equipment may be analyzed 
along the three lines already used in other connections 
— intellect, feeling, and will. Each teacher has a cer- 
tain individual coefficient of intellectual strength, of 
heart strength, and of will strength. i 
Intellectual strength. The teacher’s intellectual 
strength shows itself in the quality of her scholarship, 
in the perfection of her working habits, and in the 
possession of a judicial temper. Her schelarship must 
consist both of a fundamental integrity and of a pro- 
gressive spirit. She must have a zeal for accuracy 
and truth, for if her mind is slovenly in its operations, 
this slovenliness will carry over to the work of the 
class. Nor must the teacher be satisfied to remain 
static; her scholarship of to-day must not satisfy her 
as the measure of her scholarship of to-morrow. 
Working habits. The teacher must certainly have 
good working habits such as order, system, and indus- 
try. She who is disorderly in method, careless as to 
arrangement and classroom detail from hour to hour 
and from day to day, is very likely to get returns from 
the class commensurate with her own shortcomings.
-P-A-G-E-164
  152 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
“Disorderly” is an adjective that teachers are prone 
to use when characterizing a class, but if a teacher in 
relation to her own work is herself disorderly, how 
ean she expect her class to be otherwise in its relation 
to its part of the work? The teacher cannot teach 
work without working. She must be filled with the 
spirit of work, and in this, as in so many other 
phases, teach by example rather than by text.1 
Judicial temper. Highly important as part of the 
mental equipment of the teacher is her possession of 
a judicial temper. She must have poise, a certain 
breadth and sanity.? She must avoid the pedantic, 
stern attitude. She must acquire a sense of propor- 
tion that regards the conduct of pupils in its real light. 
With all her thought and consideration of the indi- 
vidual pupil, the teacher must be absolutely impersonal 
in her dealings. If there is any one thing above an- 
other for which a boy will condemn a teacher it is 
injustice. The boy’s ideal is frequently expressed by 
1 At this point we may well quote from Weimer (The Way to the 
Heart of the Pupil, p. 18): “One example produces a greater ef- 
fect than ten good admonitions. What do such general terms mean 
to the child as Industry, Devotion, Love, Patience, Confidence, 
Hope, Truthfulness, and the manner in which all the virtues may 
be named, unless they are brought within his comprehension by 
concrete examples, —if they are not demonstrated to his actual 
vision? The child has the teacher every day, every hour of the 
school day, before his eyes.” 
2 Says Arnold Bennett in Mental Efficiency, p. 37: “Narrow- 
minded people are never kind-hearted. You may be inclined to 
dispute this statement; please think it over; I am inclined to 
uphold it.” 
8 Kate Douglas Wiggin, Children’s Rights, p. 4: “There are women
-P-A-G-E-165
|THE TEACHER’S MENTAL EQUIPMENT 153 
the words, — “‘She’s awful strict, but she’s all right.” 
Indeed, Dr. Hall goes so far as to say that the senti- 
ment of justice is “almost the beginning of personal | 
morals in boys.” 
Absolute and individual justice. One of the chief 
difficulties of the problem in this regard comes from 
the fact that it is hard to get a class to see that justice 
is not absolute. The individual must be tried on his 
own case; and what is just to him may not be quite 
just for the next pupil. Punishments meted out to 
two or three different pupils for apparently the same 
offense may appear to the boys to be very different, 
in quality and degree. It is one of the duties of the 
teacher to develop such confidence in her on the part 
of the class that they accept the seeming injustice by 
virtue of the general confidence that they hold in the 
teacher. It is well to lead pupils away from the notion 
that punishments are formally scaled, that there is a 
schedule of different prices by which they may pay for 
their misdemeanors. We see here one more reason 
why the teacher should deal with pupils individually 
and in private whenever practicable. 
Heart strength. It is no less important that the © 
teacher shall possess what we have chosen to call 
heart strength. This does not at all mean that 
form of gushiness which frequently passes for sym- 
pathy; but which is nothing more than heart weak- 
who live in perfect puddles of maternal love who yet seem incapable 
of justice; generous to a fault, perhaps, but seldom just.”

ness.' The teacher will be an exponent of practical_| 
idealism. The idealist we have with us and also the 
practicalist; what is required in all phases of life, but 
particularly in those professions that look toward the 
influence of one’s fellow beings, is a proper combina- 
tion of these two types of mind. In teaching it is a 
sine qua non. When the teacher’s practice is touched 
throughout with the tinge of idealism it makes for 
influence in the highest degree. 
The tree gracefully casts its branches skyward 
and leaps out far above our heads, but we do not forget 
that its roots are imbedded deep in the ground. Our 
2 Annie Winsor Allen, Home, School, and Vacation, p. 10: “A 
brooding or an impulsive mind is charming and has plenty of use 
in the world; but neither is suited for a teacher of children. Their 
teacher must be sound and wholesome. Whimsies and sweeping, 
emphatic theories are fascinating and valuable, sometimes; but a 
child’s teacher must have a clear head, a keen commonsense, and 
a humorous dislike of all overemphasis.” 
It will not be amiss to cite two or three other excerpts from this 
helpful little book (pp. 15, 16, 18): — 
“For the normal children of normal parents in normal circum- 
stances, a school should not be a corporate attempt to create home 
atmosphere and home opportunities. ‘All the comforts of home’ 
is just what the school was not invented to supply ... school rep- 
resents necessity, the impartial force of public standards, public 
expectations, and impersonal circumstances. It should mean pri- 
marily Duty and Justice, — not stern justice and pitiless duty, but 
steady, satisfying duty and even-handed justice.” 
“Schooling means training, not persuasion. School is the chil- 
dren’s training-ground for the outside, inconsiderate world that 
awaits them.” 
“Even for a genius, a good school nowadays is not merely an 
opportunity; it is a regulator. For the average mind it is a stimulus. 
For the slow mind it is a necessity. But it should be a good school; 
it must be simple, serene, and thorough; and it must not fritter away 
its function by trying to be the only educational factor in life.”
-P-A-G-E-167
  THE TEACHER’S MENTAL EQUIPMENT 155 
idealism must have a superstructure that roots deep 
in the soil of practical everyday life. Wise and gen- 
uine sympathy with the pupil is the first condition of 
true control. 
Fellow understanding and humanity. This sym- 
pathy must be clearly a fellow understanding, an 
ability to put one’s self in the place of the other. The 
teacher must stand on the ground at the same level 
with her pupils. To them she says, “Yes, I know; 
I know all about your struggle; I have been through 
it myself.” If she can say this to her pupils with a con- 
viction that becomes real to them, she need not talk 
much further about it. 
One of the best-worded testimonials to the value of 
sympathy was given me on an examination paper by 
a teacher, a university student, who said: “I am 
very quick-tempered and when I have been annoyed 
at a poor recitation or stupid mistake, the word sym- 
pathy, with all the points it brings, clears my brow, and 
I proceed with a lighter heart.” 
The humanity of the teacher is something that fre- 
quently is not realized by the pupil, or if it is, the idea 
comes to him with a sudden revelation. Interesting, 
indeed, is the surprise of a pupil who happens upon 
his teacher enjoying herself. It is wise for the teacher, 
as early as possible, to get the feeling abroad that she 
is human. By some little individual experience with 
each child, she will convince all that she is one with 
them.  
-P-A-G-E-168
  156 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
The teacher must be constantly on guard against 
letting her interest and consequently her sympathy 
go out to the attractive pupils alone. The agreeable 
pupils, the well-favored pupils, the well-trained pupils, 
naturally enough make a strong appeal to the interest 
of the teacher. But probably it is these very children 
who need the teacher’s sympathy the least. The true 
teacher, the great humanitarian, will turn broodingly 
to the frail, the unfortunate, the unskilled, the sinned- 
against. The dictionary tells us that the word teacher 
is akin to “‘token.”’ A “token” is something given or 
shown. The great teacher, then, is she who gives her- 
self to those in most need of the gift of lifeand strength. 
Moreover, the teacher who thus lives and gains and 
gives will meet many gratifying responses that she had 
little dreamed were possible. As Maeterlinck tells 
us, “Be good at the depths of you, and you will dis- 
cover that those who surround you will be good even 
to the same depths. Nothing responds more infallibly 
to the secret cry of goodness than the secret cry of: 
goodness that is near.”? 
Encouragement is the keynote. Recently, in one of 
the large cities a fire chief died. His men were devoted 
to him, and upon his monument they engraved, “He 
never said, ‘Go, boys,’ but always, ‘Come.’” This is 
the aphorism of leadership. The vital principle for 
teachers is that we do not say, “Go and do this thing”; 
but, “Come, and let us do this together.” It is very 
1 Maurice Maeterlinck, The Treasure of the Humble, p. 166.
-P-A-G-E-169
  THE TEACHER’S MENTAL EQUIPMENT 157 
discouraging to the pupil to have the teacher say 
with evident offhandedness, ‘For to-morrow do the 
next ten examples.” She does not know how difficult 
is the eighth, for instance, for she, herself, has never 
done the home work that she has assigned. The un- 
sympathetic attitude of the teacher in thus throwing 
at the children work of which she has no intimate 
‘knowledge puts a strain on the relationship which she 
holds with the children and hence impairs her control. 
The ten problems are very likely looked upon as a form 
of punishment, whereas a smaller assignment, carried 
to completion, with the assistance of the teacher if 
necessary, evidences a keener feeling of sympathy. 
Cheerfulness, good nature, enthusiasm, are all 
heart qualities that are needed in the day’s work of 
the teacher. It is not every day in the year that these 
qualities are genuinely on the surface of one’s life, 
but the teacher must at least pretend that they are 
present, —under ordinary conditions, the pupils should 
not know whether the teacher has had a good night’s 
sleep or not. 
Will strength. Intellectual strength and heart 
strength must, of necessity, be merged with correspond- 
ing will strength. Firmness and decision, representing 
strength of will, must be part of the repertoire of the 
teacher. Dependence cannot always be placed upon 
the influence of the heart. Sheer will force must some- 
times be exerted to get a thing done. In dealing with 
a class the teacher is at the same time dealing with
-P-A-G-E-170
  
  158 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
individuals. She is constantly on the lookout for oppor- 
tunities to develop the individual in his powers of rea- 
soning, feeling, and will. Nevertheless, the class work 
must proceed in an orderly manner, and when the in- 
dividual, with whom heart strength has not yet done 
its perfect work, interferes with this procedure, the 
teacher is obliged to exercise control over him. 
It is to be observed, in passing, that the teacher 
of most effective will force is she who has her own will 
most strongly in hand. She gives the impression of 
illimitable reserve, of holding a power within her that 
it would be unwise for any pupil to tempt her to draw 
upon exhaustively. The teacher who spends herself in 
every encounter betrays the fact that she has little to 
spend; and conversely, the teacher who touches events 
lightly but firmly convinces that her real power cannot 
be measured. 
’ We have already noticed that the matching of will 
against will, of compulsion of the pupil by the teacher, 
is not will training for the pupil. It is done not so 
much for his good as for the general weal of the class. 
When authority is to be exercised, it must be exer- 
cised with authority. When orders are given, they must 
be put forth in a manner and tone commensurate with 
the teacher’s authority. This leads us to inquire as to 
what is the teacher’s authority.
-P-A-G-E-171
CHAPTER XX 
THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE TEACHER 
The reason for schools. Every teacher should 
clearly understand her legal position in the classroom. 
She is not there by accident in the sense that ordinary 
business relationships are more or less accidental. 
She is there as part of a comprehensive plan which the 
State has developed through the years. Every civilized 
society has come to see that education is one of its 
‘ strongest safeguards. Along with heavy expenditures 
for army and navy, for fire protection, for health 
conservation, the nation pours a large part of its 
wealth into its school systems. It realizes that its very 
stability rests upon the caliber of its future generations. 
The men and women of to-morrow are coming into 
their own, equipped for their new duties meagerly or 
thoroughly. Which shall it be? The character of their 
equipment will depend in largest measure upon the 
quality of education which they receive. 
The State provides public education, too, as part 
of the police power which it exercises, recognizing the 
school as a form of insurance against the inroads of 
poverty and crime. It is far more economical to con- 
trol the rising generation by means of education than 
to let its members run wild and then to curb and con-
-P-A-G-E-172
  160 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
trol them by means of expensive almshouses, reforma- 
tories, and penitentiaries. 
For these and other reasons, organized govern- 
ments establish and maintain schools. They can do 
this, of course, only through human agents. The chief 
of these agents is the teacher, who comes in direct 
contact with the pupils. Hence the position of the 
teacher in the classroom is that of a government agent 
vested with authority to secure the ends determined 
upon by the Government. There is necessary, how- 
ever, a more or less complex series of agents inter- 
mediate between the State and the classroom teachers. 
The legal organization. In the United States, the 
unit of educational administration is the individual 
State — not the Federal Government. Neither do the 
municipalities have any original school jurisdiction. 
Such administrative authority as the municipalities 
exercise on behalf of education are privileges vested 
in them by the State Government, privileges that are 
subject to enlargement or curtailment at any time. 
The constitution of the State makes certain provisions 
for the establishment and maintenance of schools. A 
state superintendent or commissioner administers the 
schools of the State. : 
Details of administration are further delegated to 
executive officers of smaller units of administration. 
For instance, there may be a county system, whereby 
each county is governed in school matters by a county 
superintendent. The local communities usually have
-P-A-G-E-173
  THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE TEACHER 161 
boards of trustees or school boards in whom the State 
vests some of its own prerogatives. In the cities, boards 
of education direct the schools. On the professional 
side they do this through an executive officer, called 
the city superintendent of schools. He, in turn, super- 
intends the schools through associate officers, the num- 
ber of whom varies according to the size and conse- 
quent needs of the city. The teachers receive their 
general instructions directly from the school board 
and their professional instructions from the super- 
visory officers. 
The teacher represents the State. It is highly im- 
portant that the teacher and the community in which 
she is working understand clearly that she is the rep- 
resentative and agent of the State Government and 
not in any sense the employee of the community or of 
the parents of the children in her school. This means 
that the teacher is independent of the parents in the 
administration of her office. If she is guilty of mal- 
administration, the redress of the parents is to be 
sought not in personal attack upon the teacher, but 
in appeal to her superior governmental agents. If 
the teacher acts wrongfully or unintelligently in her 
position, the State is even more interested than are 
the parents that she shall be set right. The teacher, 
then, looks for her instructions, training, and counsel 
to her professional superiors. To them only is she re- 
sponsible. She should, of course, extend all possible 
courtesy toward parents and associates, but she must
-P-A-G-E-174
  162 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
not yield to them any measure of the authority 
vested in her by the State. 
A corollary to these propositions is that the teacher 
must exercise her authority impersonally. She is to 
regard all her pupils, when thinking of them in their 
legal relationship toward her, as equally subject to 
the enforcement of the law. She is to regard herself 
as the impartial dispenser of the law. Against her no 
personal animosity can find lodgment. No parent can 
properly tell her that she is his servant or even com- 
miserate with her in the personal trials connected with 
her work. She must maintain with dignity her im- 
personal position as the State’s representative. 
The teacher’s status is legal. The legal authority of 
the teacher is expressly defined in various documents, 
with which every teacher should be thoroughly fa- 
tmniliar. She finds the terms of her authority written 
in the constitution of her State, in the regulations of 
the state department of education, and in the direc- 
tions issued by her school board and by the local 
superintendents. Every teacher should be thoroughly 
familiar with these terms so that she may exercise her 
authority over her pupils in accordance with them. 
In the classroom, she will not flaunt her position before 
her pupils, but will carry herself always with dignity, 
for in her is vested much authority. And on any oc- 
casion, when matters of discipline, come to an issue, 
she must stand firmly on legal ground. 
It may be well here to note a few of the leading
-P-A-G-E-175
  THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE TEACHER 163 
points common throughout the United States, con- 
cerning the authority of the teacher as related to the 
matter of discipline. The fundamental one is that 
the authority of the teacher over her pupils during 
school hours and on the school premises is absolute. 
She is not to be interfered with, by intruders, in the 
exercise of her authority, although she is, of course, 
answerable to her professional superiors for her acts. 
As a consequent, the teacher has authority to evict 
visitors, whether parents or others, who disturb the 
orderly progress of her work in the classroom. 
The teacher and the parent. Related to this is the 
question as to the degree of authority which the teacher 
exercises over her pupils outside of school hours and 
off the school premises. The general principle is that, 
while the pupils are traveling between the school and 
their homes, the teacher has authority at least con- 
current with that of the parent. There is support, too, 
for the principle that the teacher has authority to 
discipline pupils for acts committed by them outside 
of the school at other times, when it can be shown 
that such acts have a direct bearing upon the respect 
of the pupils for the school and the teacher. 
In case of litigation brought against a teacher, the 
burden of proof rests upon the complainant. The 
teacher has chiefly to demonstrate that her action has 
been reasonable, the court passing upon the question 
of the reasonableness of the teacher’s acts. 
The presumption is that his [the teacher’s] rules are reason- 
   
-P-A-G-E-176
       
    164 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
able; it is for the parent to raise, and for the court to settle, 
the question of the rule being unreasonable. The facts of the 
case, where they are questioned, are determined by jury; 
the points of law and the definition of reasonableness are 
determined by the judge. The same principles are followed 
by the state educational departments and state superinten- 
dents in giving rulings when these points come before them 
for adjudication. 
Real basis for class control. While we keep before 
/ us the legal position and authority of the teacher, we 
are not to lose sight of the fact that the teacher is 
primarily the practitioner of a profession. The pro- 
fession should have its own ideals and its own tenets. 
That teacher is not professional who merely stands 
before her class wielding the club of authority and de- 
pending entirely upon it for the management and con- 
trol of her pupils. Her real control rests upon her pro- 
fessional qualities. Such of these as inhere in her own 
personality have been noted. Beyond this she must 
learn her trade, and in following it she must respect 
certain principles that underlie class discipline. We 
group these principles, somewhat arbitrarily, under 
the five following heads: favorable conditions, recogni- 
tion of age, teaching method, mechanized routine, 
rewards and punishments.

discussion of the authority, responsibility, and profession of the

CHAPTER XXI 
CONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO GOOD CONTROL 
Conditions modifying obedience. Many a teacher 
makes the mistake of demanding of her pupils obedi- 
ence to school rules at times when the surrounding 
conditions may be such as to make itextremely diffi- 
cult for them to comply. It is only reasonable to ex- 
pect that the pupil, while in school, shall be physically 
and mentally comfortable. This does not mean that 
school children are to be coddled and made unrea- 
sonably dependent upon favorable environmental 
conditions, but there are certain broad respects in 
which their comfort should be considered and, if pos- 
sible, secured. Only when conditions are so respected 
may proper reactions from the pupil be demanded. 
Among these conditions are adequate school equip- 
ment, attention to the physical comfort of the pupils, 
and regard for the principles of fatigue. 
The school equipment. As regards school equip- 
ment, we may say briefly that it should be of the proper 
kind and should be properly adjusted to the immediate 
needs of the pupils. Many teachers are quite satisfied 
if they are supplied with modern equipment. They are 
negligent of the care of this equipment in the inter- 
ests of the pupils. For instance, the furniture in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  166 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
schoolroom may be of the best type, the lighting of 
the room may be provided for by satisfactory arrange- 
ment of windows and shades, the blackboards may be 
of excellent quality, etc. Even if the teacher utterly 
ignores common-sense rules as to the use of this equip- 
ment, it is, of course, better than nothing, and better 
than that of poorer quality. But one-hundred-per-cent 
efficiency is not being secured merely when the proper 
material is provided. The teacher must be constantly 
on the alert to adjust the furniture so that each pupil’s 
desk and seat are adapted to his individual use. The 
rules for this particular adjustment are simple; yet 
in the stress of the day’s program, the teacher may for- 
get to apply them. Constant attention, also, must be 
given to the proper adjustment of shades, screens, etc., 
so that the best lighting effects may be secured for 
each and every pupil. The quality of the work written 
on the blackboard by either teacher or pupils must be 
considered in its relation to its effect upon the eyesight 
of the pupils. } 
Temperature and ventilation. Among these primary 
elements of equipment must be mentioned the appa- 
ratus for the securing of proper temperature and ven- 
tilation. It is unreasonable to expect normal response 
from pupils, on either the disciplinary or teaching side, 
if they are compelled to breathe a warm or poisoned 
atmosphere. In these days, so far as mechanics can 
bring it about, the teacher is being eliminated from 
the heating and ventilating problem; that is, school
-P-A-G-E-179
CONDITIONS OF GOOD CONTROL 167 
buildings are constructed so that the temperature and 
air-supply are taken care of automatically. 
Even where this ideal system is in operation, the 
teacher is not entirely relieved from responsibility. She 
must codperate with the principal and the janitor in 
seeing that the apparatus is working properly. She 
must be ready to note lapses of the janitor in his opera- 
tion of the plant and to report promptly impairment 
of the thermostatic control of the heat. 
When the conditions are not so favorable as this, 
the teacher has a greater responsibility. She must 
watch the temperature of the classroom and the circu- 
lation of the air. The chief point for her to remember 
is that this adjustment should be made to the needs 
of the pupils and not to herself. She must keep in mind 
her own physical state and not be misled by its pecu 
liar demands. For instance, I discovered a teacher 
wearing her overcoat in a classroom with the temper- 
ature at 73°.! When questioned, she said she felt a 
little cool. In satisfying her own subnormal condition, 
she had nearly stifled her pupils. The teacher must 
also remember that when she is more actively engaged. 
1 Board of Education, City of New York, Document No. 3, 1912, 
p. 8: “It cannot be too strongly emphasized that when the tempera- 
ture of a room exceeds 72 degrees positive physical harm is being 
done to the children, which more than counterbalances any intel- 
lectual good they may be getting.” 
This document also (p. 4) “agrees with Professor C. E. A. Win- 
slow that there is only one principle of ventilation upon which 
authorities are unanimous, namely, that a high temperature is 
detrimental to mental vigor and to health. Every other principle 
is in dispute.”  
-P-A-G-E-180
    168 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
than are her pupils, the temperature that is too high 
for her may not be sufficient for them.! 
Proper grouping of pupils. There are many other 
directions aside from material equipment in which 
the physical comfort of the pupils is to be furthered. 
Chief among them is the exclusion of abnormal pupils. 
Children suffering from either physical or mental defect 
are made subject to physical discomfort when the 
same demands are put upon them that are put upon 
normal children. Their presence, too, produces an 
unsatisfactory effect upon the normal children. Per- 
haps one of the best of the hopeful tendencies in edu- 
cational administration is the trend toward effective 
segregation of abnormal types. Our schools have too 
long been heartless in the matter, and have ruthlessly 
applied standard conditions adapted to normal chil- 
dren to those who were suffering from physical im- 
pairment or distinct mental abnormality. 
Even in the case of normal pupils, we must take 
into account states of ill-health. Fundamental idiosyn- 
1 Dr. Helen C. Putnam, in her School Janitors, Mothers, and 
Health, has a lively discussion of school housekeeping and house- 
cleaning. In addition to making an earnest plea for clean school 
houses, she discusses such topics of personal relation to the pupil as: 
the air breathed at home and at school, internal cleanliness as to 
teeth and elimination of waste, what and when school children 
should eat, muscular exercise, idleness, etc. 
There is a substantial bibliography of usefulness to the teacher on 
the subject of school buildings and school hygiene. Among the 
most important books are: E. R. Shaw, School Hygiene; F. B. 
Dressler, School Hygiene ; Nathan Oppenheim, The Development of 
the Child ; Stuart H. Rowe, The Physical Nature of the Child ; Lewis 
M. Terman, The Hygiene of the School Child.
-P-A-G-E-181
CONDITIONS OF GOOD CONTROL 169 
crasies must be observed and allowed for. For in- 
stance, in some children there is a decided lack of 
balanced relation between height and other dimensions, 
which results in physical discomfort. Frequently the 
case is not understood by the child’s mother or by the 
teacher. The least that the teacher can do is to make 
proper allowances when putting class demands upon 
such pupils. 
The tall and thin children and the short and stout 
children are subject to peculiar difficulties. Height 
and weight above the average are liable to be developed 
at the expense of function. Hence we cannot demand of 
the exceptionally tall or exceptionally stout child the 
same response and reaction to the specific demands 
of the schoolroom. We must remember, too, that 
growing pains are real discomforts arising from dis- 
proportionate growth of muscle and bone, putting a 
strain on the muscles and nervous system. Malnutri- 
tion is another source of discomfort. If such a case is 
due to severe poverty, it can be ameliorated at the 
root by charitable relief. Malnutrition, however, is 
not always due to lack of food, but may be caused by 
improper food. A well-balanced dietary is especially 
necessary at adolescence, and this fact is liable to be 
overlooked even by very intelligent parents. 
Fatigue. At this point, we should give some con- 
sideration to the matter of fatigue. The subject might 
perhaps be disposed of by our saying that the more we 
study it the less we seem to know, for we must recognize
-P-A-G-E-182
  170 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
that recent investigations seem to vitiate some tra- 
ditional generalizations. However, a conservatively 
stated summary of the subject, in its relation to the 
matter of discipline, may be of value to the teacher. 
The life of the universe seems to be based upon 
rhythm; we can trace our origin in the wash of the 
tides. Human energy in the individual apparently 
has a regular flow and ebb. We distinguish three 
main rhythmic periods—daily, monthly, and seasonal. 
All of these must be reckoned with by the teacher in 
her work of guidance and control. The daily rhythm 
shows two periods of maximum, from about 9.30 to 
11 — morning and evening — and two of minimum, 
from 2 to 4 in the morning and afternoon. 
Recognition of these forms of periodicity shows 
itself in the construction of the daily time schedule. 
For the teacher to violate the ordinary rules covering 
the making of a time schedule is to court disaster in the 
matter of discipline. It is equally a mistake to demand 
work involving excessive expenditure of pupils’ en- 
ergy during their periods of depression or to under- 
work them at that time of the day when energy surges 
and interest is bound to find some outlet in expression. 
A thorough discussion of the subject of fatigue will 
be found in Max Offner (translated by G. M. Whip- 
ple), Mental Fatigue, from which the following ex- 
cerpts of special interest to the teacher, are taken: — 
In consequence df physical activity there are formed in 
the muscles certain substances, particularly lactic acid (the
-P-A-G-E-183
  CONDITIONS OF GOOD CONTROL 7 
same substance found in sour milk) and acid potassium 
phosphate (p. 10). 
Nevertheless, there is no isolated fatigue. The fatigue- 
substances do not remain where they are secreted, but are 
carried forth through the whole body by the ceaseless circu- 
lation of the blood (p. 96). 
It is hard to prevent occasional over-fatigue and we need 
not take that very tragically. But if it is repeated, or if it 
persists, and if, for weeks at a time, sleep and the other rest- 
pauses that interrupt the work do not completely restore the 
efficiency available at the beginning of the periods of work, 
if the periods of mental freshness become shorter and shorter, 
and if fatigue sets in earlier and earlier — as both teachers 
and pupils frequently experience after a hard year of school 
work, or as mental workers in general experience in the form 
of the well-known “ year’s fatigue” — then, indeed, we have 
a condition that calls for serious consideration (p. 90). 
The only rational time at which to stop work and to in- 
dulge in a restorative pause is the time at which he displays 
easily recognizable signs of fatigue, e.g., in addition to the 
poorer quality of his work (which is of special importance in 
experimental investigation), particularly signs of uneasiness, - 
decrease of attention, and a tendency to dawdle — symptoms 
which may even be seen, not only in ordinarily attentive and 
conscientious children, but also in adults. These and other 
like symptoms should obviously not be regarded, as is all too 
often the case, as invariably punishable offenses, but as signs 
of fatigue, as signals that the work ought now to be stopped 
and opportunity given for rest. To decide when the pupil 
has reached this stage in his work is precisely the teacher’s 
problem (p. 80). 
The more stimulating is a teacher’s instruction, the more 
skillful he is in riveting the attention of his pupils, the more 
fatiguing is his instruction (p. 110). 
Physical activity is also fatiguing work. It cannot, there- 
fore, afford recuperation after mental work, but itself de-
-P-A-G-E-184
    
172 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
mands a period of rest. It is, however, accompanied by 
secondary results that are extremely helpful for recuperation 
after mental work (p. 104). 
Relieving fatigue. We should be clear in. the matter 
of relaxation, realizing that different types of children 
require different treatments. For the strong, restless 
child, we should provide exercise; and for the nervous, 
restless child, rest: that is, if the pupil is active in wrong 
directions through overexuberance of energy, we must 
divert this energy into school needs; but if he is restless 
through weakness and inability to inhibit nervous 
action, we must give him rest. 
Allof these considerations form an argument in favor 
of the teacher having much freedom in the manage- 
ment of the daily program. Every experienced teacher 
ought to have a flexible time schedule, being held only 
to devoting a certain number of minutes each day to 
each subject. The order in which the subjects are 
to be taken should be left to her discretion. Only in 
this way is she able, freely and intelligently, to deal 
with the ever-changing conditions of the classroom.

underlying good class discipline that next merits atten- 
tion is the recognition of mental and physical age. 
The competent teacher in thinking of the individual 
pupil keeps constantly in mind the stage which he 
has reached in his development. She does not expect 
exactly the same response to all of the routine of the 
class from each and every one of her pupils. In the low- 
est grades, where all pupils are unquestionably in the 
infancy stage, and in the secondary school grades, 
where the pupils are at adolescence, the problem is 
much simplified. But in all other grades of school life 
there is imperative need for recognition of the fact 
that the teacher faces children in two of the stages of 
development, if not, indeed, in three. 
The mixture in the middle grades. Particularly 
difficult is the problem in the middle grades of the 
elementary school, those of the fourth, fifth, and sixth 
school year. The experience of every teacher demon- 
strates that here are to be found pupils in three stages 
— the plateau of childhood, pubescence, and youth. 
The study of the age tables of pupils in any system of 
schools puts it before us even more clearly. Approxi-
-P-A-G-E-186
174 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
mately one third of the pupils in a fifth- or sixth-year 
class are in the plateau period of childhood. Not only 
do they merit the treatment appropriate to this period, 
but to treat them otherwise is to put a distinct strain 
upon class discipline. In the same room there is 
approximately another third of pupils who are fully 
adolescent, and who, in their turn, deserve to have 
the class exercises conducted in accordance with their 
peculiar needs. Between these two grades there is that 
other group, of pubescents, whose successful nurture 
demands the most peculiar skill. 
Grouping by physiological age. In any school where 
there are more classes than grades, it is well to recog- 
nize this difference in age by grouping the pupils into 
two or more classes of the same grade. There is a 
large unworked field for investigation and experiment 
along this line. Such meager experiment as has been 
made indicates that there is a value in segregating 
the infant and the adolescent pupils. With the pu- 
pils thus grouped, many problems in discipline dis- 
appear. The whole methodology is different for each 
group. The outlook upon life, as the result of the life 
within, differs so divergently that in each case the 
presentation of subject-matter will be attacked in a 
very different manner and spirit. It is to be hoped 
that in time we shall have clearly differentiated the 
distinctive methodology and distinctive technique for | 
these two groups of pupils. Then, through this distine- | 
tive methodology, we shall have one more criterion
-P-A-G-E-187
RECOGNITION OF AGE 115 
to apply in the determination of physical and mental 
age. 
We have been so zealous of recent years to unify the 
activities of the school and to systematize the work 
of gradation, that we have come to violate, in large 
measure, these principles of age recognition. We are 
beginning to see, however, that classification of pupils 
merely on the basis of the exact stage that they have 
reached in their studies is not a scientific procedure. 
The markedly over-age pupil. Especial considera- 
tion is to be given to the pupil who is extremely over- 
age for his grade. The boy of fifteen, for example, who 
is in a fourth-year grade is sadly misplaced. Such a 
boy cannot be given credit on the school records for 
work which he has not performed, but his case is prac- 
tically hopeless if he is left to stumble along spending 
two or three terms in a grade until he reaches the age 
at which the law permits him to leave for work. Placed 
among children four or five years his junior, he feels 
humiliated and is naturally indifferent to the work 
that is put before him. The remedy for his case is to 
place him in a grade among his peers as to age, that is, 
in a sixth- or seventh-year class. In this very different 
environment, with askillful and understanding teacher, 
he will get more from the school than he is likely to 
receive in any other place in it. Here he has a motive 
for pushing himself toward accomplishment. Any 
humiliation which he may have will not be of the hope- 
less sort. Under the skilled guidance of the teacher, he
-P-A-G-E-188
  176 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
is likely to receive a considerable amount of help from 
his fellow pupils, and, moreover, there is every chance 
that his developing attitude will at last get hold of 
something that may be a real inspirational force. 
Physiological age and compulsory education. In 
this connection we may note the chief weakness of our 
otherwise admirable compulsory education laws. The 
criterion which they impose is that of chronological 
age. The typical law, in most of the progressive States, 
permits pupils to leave school for work not earlier 
than at the age of fourteen. The result is that the 
law operates disadvantageously against a small per- 
centage of pupils: pupils who ought to be permitted 
to work but are held by the law, and pupils who are 
permitted to work but should be kept in school. 
There are puny children, matiring late, beset by ad- 
verse home conditions, — poverty and malnutrition, 
— who are set to work by their parents the moment 
they reach the legal age. The law would be wiser if it 
stayed the hand of the parent until the school had 
given the child better training for the work of the 
business world and he had reached a degree of ma- 
turity by which he could the more successfully com- 
pete in that world. 
On the other hand are boys and girls, favored physi- 
cally, who, months before they reach the legal age, are 
as well equipped for work as they ever will be. Their 
mental training has for the present reached its maxi- 
mum. The school has given them all it has to give
-P-A-G-E-189
  RECOGNITION OF AGE Ww 
them or that they are competent to receive. They are 
held, marking time, until finally released by the birth- 
day that eventually appears on the much studied 
calendar. The worst of it is, too, that many cannot 
“mark time,” but deliberately set out to “kill” it. 
This means disciplinary difficulties for the school and 
for the pupil himself, economic loss of valuable time 
and a positive deterioration of moral fiber. And so- 
ciety suffers, too, by the fact that the boy or girl grows 
up soured toward the Government and the institu- 
tion, the school, that held him in bondage during those 
surging months of his life. 
*

CHAPTER XXIII 
TEACHING METHOD 
Merging instruction and discipline. A third prin- 
ciple to be observed in securing discipline is that 
proper teaching method should be employed. In the 
minds of the authorities of many school systems, in- 
struction and~discipline are differentiated. This is 
emphasized by the provision that teachers be rated 
separately in each of these phases of work. It is pos- 
sible, of course, to set up separate criteria along each 
of these lines, and yet the expert teacher owes her suc- 
cess, in large measure, to her skill in merging the two. 
This is not always recognized, as is illustrated by the 
teacher who was visiting a school for the purpose of 
observation. Toward the close of the day she said to 
the principal, “Now I have seen arithmetic and 
geography, but I have not yet seen any discipline. 
Please show me a class where there is discipline.” 
Unfortunately, this teacher is not alone in her view that 
discipline is something peculiarly independent of the 
study work of the class. 
We have, then, to consider the very serious bearing 
which the teacher’s method has upon the success of 
her class management. Every minute of the school 
day is part of the life of the individual and of the class.
-P-A-G-E-191
TEACHING METHOD 179 
Every minute must be reckoned with by the teacher. 
Every minute has its possibility of disaster. The 
- teacher’s method, as related to discipline, must be 
intelligent, flexible, and artistic. 
Accuracy vs. carelessness. In every subject, the 
methods employed must be highly intelligent. Pre- 
eminently the teacher must be accurate in her mental 
processes.! Her very respect for the equality sign will 
have its unconscious influence upon the minds of the 
pupils. They in turn will sense the propriety of rec- 
ognizing truth in every department of life. The 
teacher who is careless in this respect and permits false 
statements to stand uncorrected on the blackboard is 
bound to lose a little in the sharpness with which her 
pupils comprehend integrity. If the teacher thinks 
loosely, clumsily, or awkwardly on the purely intel- 
lectual phases of the curriculum, she is likely to think 
vaguely on questions of morality and law; and if this 
is her mental state, she can scarcely reproach her pupils 
if they, in turn, are inaccurate in their judgments as to 
conduct. 
Anticipating pupil difficulties. Another direction 
in which the teacher’s method must be highly intelli- 
gent in order to avoid disastrous results in discipline 
1 William D. Hyde, God’s Education of Man, p. 181: “The 
teacher or writer is saint or sinner primarily according as the pres- 
entation of truth in attractive and winsome form to pupils or reader 
is the object of unwearying training and research, correction and 
self-criticism; or, as he is content to palm off traditional views in 
conventional form with little concern as to truth of substance, or 
grace of style or manner.”
-P-A-G-E-192
  180 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM | 
is that, in all the logical studies, she must anticipate 
the intellectual difficulties of the pupils. For instance, 
when, in a problem in arithmetic, the pupil makes an 
error, the acute teacher divines the wrong reasoning 
which misled the pupil. In the light of this knowledge 
she anticipates further difficulty and sets the pupil aright 
immediately. If she fails to do this, the pupil falls into 
a hopeless tangle; and when he reaches this point he 
is likely to be discouraged and slip into a humor that 
makes good conduct difficult. 
Skill in questioning. A distinct source of disciplin- 
ary difficulties is lack of skill in questioning. The con- 
secutive recitation usually results in each pupil’s giving 
attention to the subject only in proportion to the 
proximity of his “turn.” Most of the pupils are left 
free to wander off mentally, and hence disciplinarily, 
if not morally. The recitation must be so conducted as 
to demand an alert attitude from all the members of 
the class. At the same time, the teacher must not mis- 
take for a misdemeanor the natural difficulty of the 
slow pupil in responding to the rapid-fire question. 
As she grows in knowledge of the individuals of the 
class, she will gain in the insight that distinguishes 
between willful neglect and natural hesitation. 
Planning and change. The teacher must definitely 
plan the day’s work in advance. Failure to do this 
leads to difficulties both in respect to individual con- 
duct and to class control. Lack of scientific planning 
shows its effects in befogging the mind of the individual, 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  TEACHING METHOD 181 
There is danger, too, that the teacher induces weariness 
in her pupils, the effects of which she may mistake for 
fatigue. Weariness must be distinguished from fa- 
tigue. It arises not from excess of effort, but from a 
lack of interest. One may be wearied by a dull sermon, 
showing much the same symptoms as if fatigued; yet 
when released from listening to the sermon, one is 
quite prepared to exert one’s self without fatigue. On 
the other hand, one may be fatigued by work that is 
intensely interesting; one might pursue it further with- 
out the slightest wearisomeness. So the teacher must 
be ready to note the moment when her teaching has 
become so dull that it is reflected in a bored class. A 
bored class is not an “orderly” class. 
Work ill-planned also leads to hiatuses in the day’s 
program, when the teacher is cudgeling her brain as 
to what to do next. It is during these between-times 
that the class is most likely to get away from orderly 
routine. Not only must the work be planned, but there 
must be a skillful transition from one set of activities 
to another, so that one merges into the other. Material 
for one lesson is brought out or even distributed unob- 
trusively during the preceding lesson. Whenever there 
is a tendency on the part of the class to break away 
during one of the “‘between-times,” the teacher may 
have recourse to a brisk setting-up exercise that 
changes the focus of attention, short-circuits energy, 
and restores equilibrium. \ 
The teacher must remember, too, that for young
-P-A-G-E-194
  182 oe AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
children, motor éducation is extremely important. 
This principle is to be remembered in every exercise 
of the day. Wherever there is opportunity in the 
course of a lesson, a certain amount of motor activity 
should be provided. Every nervous impulse that finds 
expression in legitimate work is saved from going into 
mischief. 
Flexibility in method and plan. Finally, the teacher 
must make her method not only intelligent but in- 
creasingly flexible. At the beginning of her career, 
in her inexperience, she must adhere closely to recog- 
nized methods in all departments of her work. Gradu- 
ally, however, as she gains in experience, she will put 
more and more of her own genius into the problems 
before her. She will never get away from adherence 
to fundamental principles, but she will come to build 
upon them with devices of her own. She will realize 
that it is more important to get results and to hold 
the class than to follow any stilted forms of pedagogy. 
For example, at the outset of her career, she will work 
with a full knowledge of the technique of the five 
formal steps, and for some while will scrupulously ob- 
serve this procedure; but in time she will free herself 
and will not hesitate to omit one or more of the steps 
if she thinks better results can be gained thereby. The 
more expert the teacher becomes in adjusting the 
method of the moment to the situation of the mo- 
ment, the more sure will be her touch in the handling 
of the discipline problem.
-P-A-G-E-195
  
TEACHING METHOD 183 
Art in teaching. As the teacher gains in the intelli- 
gence that she puts into her methods and in the de- 
gree of flexibility with which she handles them, the 
more artistic will her work become. The ideal of 
the teacher, as in any other line of human endeavor, 
is to become the artist. One of the accepted apho- 
risms is that art conceals art. In the painting, the skill 
of the artist does not obtrude itself. The finished 
statue must not bring to our minds the thought of the 
perspiring sculptor. The rare poem does not show any 
of the marks of the hammer and chisel that have been 
used to mould it into shape. The thing that is truly 
artistic is done with apparent ease. 
The teacher who has not this ease in all her work has 
not reached the art stage. She will never violate any 
of the essential principles of her art, but her work 
will always show that her thought of those principles 
has been subordinated in consciousness. Her work 
must exhibit no attitude that seems to say, “Watch 
me; I am now about to apply a Pestalozzian princi- 
ple.” As Mr. Mabie puts it: — 
One of the secrets of the artist is the facility and complete- 
ness with which he turns his conscious processes of mind 
into unconscious ones, and so does without effort that which 
costs a man less thoroughly trained no little toil.t 
Moreover, the art which the teacher ultimately

p. 280): “To the true artist, working always in humility and sin- 
cerity, all life is a reward, and every day brings a deeper satisfac- 
tion: Joy and peace are by the way.”  
-P-A-G-E-196
  184 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
acquires in teaching method cannot fail to be ac- 
companied by a finesse in the handling of all those 
correlated incidents that in their sum total we call 
discipline.
-P-A-G-E-197
CHAPTER XXIV 
MECHANIZING ROUTINE 
Class routine. The individual appreciates the 
value of habit’ as a labor-saving device. To think 
out anew every adjustment to an often-recurring sit- 
uation would be wasteful of time and energy. In the 
same way the teacher, in her class management, recog- 
nizes the value of mechanizing the routine activities. 
Every class exercise should be so systematized that the 
energy of the pupils is not frittered away in learning to 
do the habitual things over again each day. The en- 
ergy thus freed is available for the profitable work of 
the class. In addition, there is a distinct relation to 
the problem of discipline involved in the way in which 
routine is effected. Order is so much Heaven’s first law 
that even children appreciate the beauty of it. To per- 
form a class exercise in an orderly, systematic way 
excites the admiration of the pupils; and every ex- 
ercise so performed diminishes the chance of miscon- 
duct. 
Two broad principles govern the mechanizing of 
routine. The first of these is that the process should 
be accomplished early in the term. There must be 
constant drill at the very beginning of the first session 
and this attention to the perfecting of routine must be
-P-A-G-E-198
  186 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
continued until the class and teacher need no longer 
give it a thought. 
Class orders. The second necessary principle con- 
cerns the proper giving of orders. Orders should al- 
ways be well considered and clearly formulated. Many 
teachers lose their power of control through violation 
of this principle. They give a command before they 
have thought out its propriety and its consequences. 
Only after the command has been issued do they see 
its impropriety or futility; then, in a groping way, they 
amend it, possibly two or three times, before they 
have the order as it should have been given in the first 
place. Difficulty also arises from orders that are in- 
distinct and utterly incomprehensible to the pupils. 
Orders, too, should be as few in number as is consistent 
with securing proper results. Only necessary direc- 
tions should be given. It is a truism that teachers 
talk too much. While this criticism is leveled largely 
at the teacher’s method in dealing with the lesson, it 
carries over to her attitude toward the giving of com- 
mands. 
With the class well drilled in all the daily-recurring 
exercises of routine, it becomes unnecessary for the 
teacher to amplify orders in these matters. The simplest 
word of command, or other signal, should be devised at 
the beginning and never deviated from. Pupils must 
be trained to obey these simple signals promptly and 
accurately. Except under peculiar circumstances, 
commands should not be repeated. If the teacher
-P-A-G-E-199
MECHANIZING ROUTINE 187 
gets into the habit of repeating her orders, her class 
will naturally assume that they are not expected to 
comply until the last moment; on the contrary, if the 
commands are given but once, the pupils soon form 
the habit of prompt obedience. It is odd to hear the 
injunction, “Go quietly,” so universally used, espe- 
cially when visitors are present, with its implication 
that the usual custom is to make all the noise possible. 
Except during the opening weeks of the term, and 
occasionally later when lapses occur and are made once 
more the subject of attention, such remarks ought to 
be superfiuous. 
Again, the voice used in giving commands should 
be just loud enough to insure being heard by all 
pupils concerned. Any excess of tone is for the 
teacher an added strain, which, accumulating through 
the day, amounts to a considerable loss of energy. 
Moreover, if the pupils know that commands are al- 
ways given in moderate tones, they will be in a con- 
stant attitude of alertness. This attitude, needless to 
say, is conducive not only to effective work, but also 
to the elimination of many of the danger-points in 
discipline. 
Advantages of orderly routine. Another advantage 
of well-ordered routine is that it insures the accom- 
plishment of things that might otherwise be neglected 
with disastrous effects upon discipline. For example, 
if there is systematic attention to clearing waste papers 
from desks, etc., and to keeping the blackboard sills
-P-A-G-E-200
  
188 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
free from dust and odd pieces of chalk, just so much 
temptation to carelessness or mischief is removed. 
Yet another value of orderly routine is its tendency 
to train pupils in forming habits generally: that is, on 
account of the mechanizing of the ordinary material 
exercises of the classroom, there is bound to be a 
certain amount of “carry-over” to the better estab- 
lishment of good habits of personal care and of mental 
operations. 
Chief among the exercises that should be subjected 
to routine drill are the entrance and exit of pupils, 
the movements of pupils about the classrooms, and 
the distribution and collection of materials. 
Progressive freedom. Concerning the entrance and 
exit of pupils, it is a question whether the passing of 
pupils shall be made formally or with a degree of free- 
dom. Whatever may be the rules established by the 
head of the school, the teacher does well to supple- 
ment them with reasonable requirements based upon 
the age of her pupils and other local considerations. If 
she has the older pupils, she may give them a degree 
of liberty unaccorded to the younger pupils. Again, if 
her class is in special need of firm control, she may re- 
quire from them a more rigid adherence to form than 
is required throughout the school generally. 
At the beginning of the term, the teacher can hardly 
make her standards of conduct too high. As in many 
other matters, she may better require an inflexible 
conformance at first and later grant freedom as it is
-P-A-G-E-201
  
MECHANIZING ROUTINE 189 
earned than to reverse the order and have to bring 
up with a round turn pupils who have started out 
abusing the liberty accorded or taking the liberty that 
has not been granted. The same principle applies to 
the movements of pupils about the room during the 
session. On the other hand, such exercises as the han- 
dling of materials may better be done throughout the 
entire term in precisely the same manner as on the 
first day.? 
1 William C. Bagley, in his Classroom Management, has a chapter 
entitled “‘ Mechanizing Routine,” which helpfully treats the subject 
in considerable detail.
-P-A-G-E-202
CHAPTER XXV 
REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS 
The recourse at crucial moments. As we have seen, 
the class teacher establishes cenditiens favorable to 
the physical comfort of her.pupils. She follows meth- 
ods of teaching that are conducive to easy control, 
particularly adapting her methods to the stage in 
development in which she finds her pupils. She so 
regulates and mechanizes the routine work of her class 
as to eliminate waste motion ard waste time. In all 
these ways the teacher simplifies the problem of dis- 
cipline and establishes healthy morale. But even with 
attention to all these. matters, there will yet be mo- 
~ ments when the pupil fails to respond to natural mo- 
tives, or even sets himself against authority. When 
these times arrive, the teacher finds it necessary to 
fall back upon something besides artful leadership. 
She must deliberately have recourse to rewards and 
punishments: that is, at crucial times, there must be 
tangible reward for proper conduct and tangible pun- 
ishment for misconduct. 
1 We can hardly agree with Froebel in hi§ extreme language, for- 
getful of the value of habit-formation, when he exclaims: “How we 
degrade and lower the human nature which we should raise, how we 
weaken those whom we should strengthen, when we hold up to them 
an inducement to act virtuously.” 
a C  
-P-A-G-E-203
REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS 191 
This means no more than that such motives of ac- 
tion are called into play as are not logically associated 
with the conduct desired. If the immediate interest 
of the pupil is naturally in the exercise that he is called 
upon to perform, there is no use of discipline in any 
sense of the word. The performance of the action 
follows naturally as a result of the immediate interest. 
But this is no more than what may be said of animal 
life and conduct. The highest values in human life 
are created when we learn to act not merely in accord- 
. ance with interests that are immediately compelling, 
but also with motives less closely related to the task 
at hand. 
Motives in relation to moral training. Thus moral 
education may be said to consist of a gradual extension 
of the ability to act upon motives further and further 
removed from the immediate present,/ The teacher, 
therefore, will grade her rewards and punishments to 
meet different motives, and apply them with intelli- 
gent respect for the age of her pupils. With the young- _ 
est pupil the rewards and punishments must have an 
immediate application and must necessarily be sup- _ 
plied from outside his own consciousness. With the _ 
oldest pupil, they may be more remote in their rela- 
tion to the present and are to be derived from within _ 
the pupil’s own mental life. That is, there must be 
recognition of the development of intellect, feeling, 
and will as related to conduct, which is equivalent to_ 
the recognition of the development of conscience.   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-204
    192 DISCIPLINE AS A CL..SS PROBLEM 
Between the youngest pupil and the oldest are pu- 
pils of all grades of development, so that there must 
be constant testing and striving to make operative 
motives of successively higher and higher rank. This 
demands the greatest skill on the part of the teacher 4 
so that she may select the motives most closely applic- 
able to each pupil. Appeal to motives above the pu- 
pil’s reason and appeal to motives ,that he has out- 
grown are equally disastrous to his immediate 
conduct and to his moral growth. ‘ 
Rewards and punishments. All that has just been 
said applies alike to rewards and to punishments, so 
that the teacher has frequently to choose between the 
two as a means of disciplines“ In general, we may say 
that it is better to appeal to the pupil by way of reward 
than by way of punishment. The spirit of the pupil is~ | 
better sustained by a minimum of punishment. Never- 
theless, no pupil s should ibe exempt from the operation * 
important and 
unavoidable face in life. (XN No pupil should be sent i

7 ~Tn fact, “A painful experience i is sometimes the only 
thing to impress the dull mind. It has been found in 
studying the behavior of animals that they learn more 
quickly by being punished for failure than by being 
rewarded for successes. ... What is true of the ani-   
 
-P-A-G-E-205
  REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS 193 
mal is probably to an extent true of the child. That 
is to say, education cannot entirely dispense with pain 
as a stimulus.” + : 
There are some traditional forms of punishment that 
at times may well be converted into rewards. For in- 
stance, the time-honored habit of detaining pupils 
beyond the school session might better be made a 
reward for good conduct than punishment for mis- 
conduct. Any skillful teacher ought to be able tomake 
an extra half-hour so interesting to her pupils that they 
would strive for the privilege of remaining with her. 
If the teacher scheduled these extra periods once or 
twice a week, she would find that she has a long lever- 
age of control throughout the entire week; refusal to 
permit an individual pupil to remain with the others 
would become a real punishment. 
“Doing time.” Particularly to be deplored is the’ 
practice of detaining pupils for lateness, except as the 
lateness may have involved a loss of work which must. 
be made up after school. In this case the detention is 
to be regarded merely as a logical sequence and not as 
a punishment. The same may be said of the practice 
of dismissing the class, or individuals thereof, an hour 
or more earlier on a particular day as a reward either 
for good attendance or for excellent work. Humanize 
the school — it is not a place for “doing time.” The 
whole traditional attitude has been that the school is 
some form of imprisonment.. If the school were this, it 
1 Colvin and Bagley, Human Behavior, p. 60.  
-P-A-G-E-206
194 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
would be reasonable to permit pupils, on account of 
good behavior, to secure an immunity of their sentence 
and gain escape for a certain period. But how much 
better to create in the school itself such a spirit of ap- 
preciation of the school, if not actual devotion to it, 
that pupils recognize the value of school attendance. 
Commendation. “Among the other rewards usually 
cited are commendation, privileges, and various de- ' 
vices. These are all applicable in theelementary school, 
but as progress is made through the grades the use 
of devices should be diminished proportionately. 
It is well for the teacher to have some routine form of 
commendation such as a reward of merit, or a note of 
approbation addressed to the parent, or a letter form 
addressed to the parent to be written by the pupil 
and countersigned by the teacher. Informally, the 
teacher will make free but intelligent use of brief notes 
from herself to the pupil. Another form of routine 
commendation is the practice of writing some phrase 
of approbation directly upon the pupils’ work, or the 
teacher may have a repertoire of rubber stamps that 
she uses for the purpose. 
Oral commendation ranges from the slight word of 
approval to the formal address, in which the regular 
work of the class is stopped and the teacher calls 
special attention, in fitting language of approbation, 
to the work of some particular pupil or pupils. 
Forms of privileges. The best form of privileges are 
those that render service to the class, — such posi-

tions as are popularly known as monitorships. This 
statement, however, does not indorse the appoint- 
ment of monitors to watch over or govern other pu- 
pils of the class, unless, perhaps, in the higher grades, 
when the pupils desire monitors and elect their own. 
Among these privileges of service are all those deal- 
ing with the routine work of the class, including Miss 
Myra Kelly’s Monitor of the Gold Fish. Pupils who 
do any one thing especially well may be given the 
privilege of demonstrating to the others, either to 
the class as a whole, or to individuals, or to a small 
group. This applies both to the regular school exer- 
cises and to the matters of formal conduct. 
In general, we do not put enough of the notion of 
service into the regular work of the school. For ex- 
ample, the traditional reading lesson consists in 
having every pupil follow the one who is reading aloud, 
each with his book before him, eager to wave his in- 
terrupting hand and call hypercritical attention to the 
omission of a comma or mispronunciation of a word.? 
Fully as much reading would be taught, certainly in 
grades above the third, and a much better spirit would 
be encouraged, if, most of the time, the pupils who 
were not reading listened attentively to the story. 
The reader would then be palpably and reasonably 
tested by his ability to interest his classmates.

196 = =©DISCIPLIN: AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
In the early grades, where it is necessary that the 
motive must come very close to the action desired, 
devices such as those of rubber stamps, stars, or flags, 
and the writing of honor rolls on the blackboard, are 
- tobe used generously in those subjects in which natural 
rewards are not inherent. As we go upward in the 
grades, however, these devices should gradually be dis- 
carded, just as we throw away the crutches when we 
have learned to walk. We must pass from the “I am 
pleased with that,” accompanied by the approving pat 
on the curly locks, to the maturer “Does this please 
you?” 
Punishments. “Regarding punishments, the words 
of William H. Payne, written forty years ago, still 
hold good: — 
é Government is positive, not negative; it does not consist 
in advising people what to do, leaving the matter, in the end, 
to their own discretion. It assumes that some will choose to 
do what ought not to he done, and so places before them a 
penalty sufficient to secure an enforced obedience. In the 
absence of internal motives to do right, the law holds forth 
an artificial motive in the form of a penalty attached to vio- 
lations of prescribed laws. 
Punishments should/ be distinct, deliberate, de- 
cisive, impersonal, There sho no nagging, nor 
should pupils have reasonable ground for believing 
that the teacher entertains “grudges.” It is more im- 
‘portant that punishments should uuld be sure than severe. ~

flicted when it is merited acts much better, both as to 
the individual concerned and as a deterrent on the other members of the class, than do spasmodic and 
severe punishments meted out haphazard. Nor should 
punishments often be prescribed as to details. Pun- 
ishment, we must grant, is an appeal to the fear motive. 
We cannot gloss over this fact. Hence, if we are to 
use punishment at all, we must make it fearful, and 
fear is usually greater in its forebodings of disaster 
than in the disaster itself. As Maeterlinck tells us, 
even death is not itself the tragedy, — only the fear 
of it.! Hence, in class control, the mysterious punish- 
ment is More effective than the one the details of which 
are thoroughly understood by every one in the class. 
It may be noted-herethat the Spencer theory of 
natural punishment has its serious limitations for 
application in the classroom. The chief value of the 
natural punishment is in the early years of the child’s 
life and in his discipline in the home. So much of 
school work is necessarily unnatural that there can be 
no really natural punishment connected with'it. The 
only genuine natural punishment —the ultimate loss 
to the individual as the roult‘ot not J having made the 
most of his opportunities in school — is very vague and 
transcendental to the child. In fact, it is virtually. 
inoperative.   
“1 Maurice Maeterlinck, Our Eternity, p. 17: “Let us, then, learn 
to look upon death as it is in itself, free from the horrors of matter 
and stripped of the terrors of the imagination.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  198 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
Detention as a punishment. As to detention as a 
punishment, aside from the fact already cited that 
it is illogical, when it comes to be used wholesale and 
with certainty for the misdeeds of the day, it has little 
deterrent value. There is something, if not a good 
deal, of the gambler in every boy. He is willing to set 
off an anticipated detention against whatever “fun” 
he thinks he is getting by misconduct during the ses- 
sion. Thus, when at ten o’clock the hasty teacher tells 
him that she will keep him in after three for some of- 
fense he has just committed, he immediately adjusts 
his program to this contingency. He misbehaves 
further in order to get his “money’s worth.” At noon 
he arranges with “the fellers” to begin the game at 
four, instead of three-thirty, because he’s “goin’ to 
get kep’ in.” By three, he is primed toa high and rea- 
sonable fortitude, with a complacent feeling that it 
has all been worth while. 
Tf used at all, detention should come infrequently 
and unexpectedly. It has some real value, if, at dismis- 
sal, just as the line is passing; the teacher says, “Oh, 
John, you may step to one side,” and then explains — 
that for certain misdeeds, about which very likely she 
had said nothing at the time, she will detain him. This 
is quite sure to interfere with some of John’s well-laid 
plans for the afternoon’s amusement, and he a real 
punishment to him. 
Of the most common punishments employed in the 
class, we may cite some that are generally prohibited
-P-A-G-E-211
  
REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS 199 
to the teacher by the pedagogic books. Threats, 
scolding, and sarcasm are cited as punishments that 
are anathema. We must take issue with this prop- 
osition, for, applied intelligently, these have their 
place in class control. It is an axiom that the teacher 
who threatens her class constantly, or scolds continu- 
ally throughout the day, or gives frequent vent to sar- 
castic language, will fail miserably; but this fact in no 
way annuls the value of these implements in the hands 
of the artist. 
Superfluous discipline. In matters of discipline, 
as in the method of the recitation, teachers are prone 
to talk too much. They spend an undue amount of 
time in useless and foolish questioning as to petty of- 
fenses. In the words of Dr. Weimer: “We hear every 
day in our schools the same stupid questions: ‘What 
are you doing there?’ ‘Why are you laughing?’ 
‘What are you doing behind your desk?’ ‘Why did 
you turn around?’ etc., and in consequence of these 
questions a hundred useless lies and much superfluous 
punishment follow.” 
The infrequent threat made formally, deliberately, 
and truthfully, addressed to an offender who has not 
been amenable to.other motives, is of a distinct value 
in discipline. It should not be so much a threat of 
what the teacher will do as the impersonal statement 
of fact as to what nature or the law will provide by 
way of punishment of an offense. The same may be 
1 Hermann Weimer, The Way to the Heart of the Pupil, p. 100.
-P-A-G-E-212
  200 DISCIPLINE AS A CLASS PROBLEM 
said of the formal reprimand. The teacher who rep- 
rimands constantly through the day becomes an 
unlovely “scold,” but an occasional reprimand adminis- 
tered deliberately and formally can be made a punish- 
ment both wise and effective. For instance, the teacher 
has had several interviews with a particular pupil who 
persists in his misconduct. Finally, in one of these 
interviews, she warns him that if he persists she will be 
obliged to reprimand him before the class. Then, 
when the occasion arises for issuing the reprimand, the 
teacher does it with calm deliberation and great for- 
mality. She has the class stop work; she addresses 
the offender; she reminds him that he was warned of 
this particular punishment, but has not heeded the 
warning, and now merits the punishment; she expresses 
her regret that what might, by the pupil’s choice, have 
remained a personal matter, must be brought to the 
attention of the entire class. Then, in sharp incisive 
tones and in fitting language, she reprimands the 
pupil. With closing formality she expresses her hope 
for his future and, perhaps, adds an appropriate word 
to the class before directing them to resume their 
regular work. 
Sarcasm will be found less available and should be 
employed in only rare intervals, because it has about 
it a certain amount of meanness and indirection not 
inherent in the straightforward reprimand. Moreover, 
in the case of younger children, it is quite apt to lose its 
effect, being beyond their comprehension. Neverthe-
-P-A-G-E-213
  REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS 201 
less, for pupils who do understand it, on rare occa- 
sions, a direct, cutting opinion, judicially expressed, 
has all the virtues of a proper punishment. 
‘Corporal punishment, even when permitted in a 
school, should not be administered by the teacher. 
Consideration of the subject will be taken up under the 
topic of discipline as a school problem. 
Improper punishments. It remains to refer to cer- 
tain improper class punishments frequently used by 
unskillful teachers. Chief of these is, of course, the 
violation of any rule that may exist prohibiting cor- 
poral punishment; nor should anything be employed 
that may be construed as corporal punishment. Again, 
should never be employed as punishments for mis- 
conduct. Not only does this violate the principle that 
school work should not be regarded in the light of an 
affliction, but it is ordinarily illogical and has a dam- 
aging effect upon the penmanship and neatness of the 
pupil’s work. Another thing that should be avoided 
is the punishing of a group of pupils for the offense   
  
of one or more individuals. It is far better that the 
teacher should let the guilty ones escape than that a 
single innocent one should suffer. This does not mean 
that the teacher is to overlook offenses committed, 
but that there are other ways of securing the results 
desired. 
Proper attitude in punishments. The offenses of 
the pupil are either against the authority of the

be construed as against the teacher personally, excey 
in the case, perhaps, of actual physical assault, whe 
it might be wise for the teacher to bring action against 
the pupil in the courts \The pupil’s fear should be of 
the punishment, not of the toother. It is an ideal con- 
dition when all offenses of individuals are construed 
as against the spirit of the class, so that the class it- 
self punishes its own offenders. Having secured thi 
ideal, the teacher’s official authority needs to opera 
only indirectly in guiding the class conscience an 
the class action in administering justice. Thus th: 
class may very effectively codperate in awarding both 
commendation and condemnation, determining when 
they are merited and what form they shall take. teacher or the spirit of the ads Never should “a

CHAPTER XXVI 
THE PRINCIPAL AS DISCIPLINARIAN 
Grouping of classes a new factor. We now pass to 
the problem of discipline in relation to the school, 
as distinguished from the individual and the class. 
When individuals are grouped together in a class, the 
problem of discipline, as we have seen, becomes com- 
plicated by the addition of a certain atmosphere and 
spirit characteristic of the crowd. In the same way, 
when a number of classes are gathered together in a 
school, another new factor has been introduced. 
School spirit is now to be reckoned with and striven 
for. By virtue of the fact that the classes are grouped 
into a school, certain physical and material conditions 
necessitate the modification of the rules and prin- 
ciples governing class management. One example may 
be cited. Frequently, in a school of a single class, the 
logical method of dealing with the misconduct of an 
individual is to exclude him temporarily from the 
room. In a large school, however, it is necessary to 
prohibit the teachers from applying this method, be- 
cause the thought might easily occur to three or four 
teachers along the same corridor at the same time, 
with the result that three or four pupils might be found 
picnicking in the hall.
-P-A-G-E-218
  206 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
The school principal. The development of the 
school introduces not only a new element in the prob- 
lem of discipline, but also a new official to deal with 
the problem. There must be an administrative head 
in the building, a principal teacher, one who has super- 
vision of the pupils and also of the teachers of the 
pupils. We have, then, to consider the chief qualities 
necessary in a principal to make him competent to 
handle this problem. 
The first thing to be said is that the principal should 
have all the characteristics of a good teacher. He must 
have had teaching experience. Unless he has been 
face to face with the teachers’ problems in a classroom, 
his supervision lacks the necessary understanding 
and sympathy. It is not assumed that the principal 
is a better teacher than the sum of all his teachers, but 
he should be as good a teacher as the best of them. 
The leader of the orchestra is not a virtuoso on 
every instrument, but he understands every instru- 
ment, he understands every one of his players, and he 
understands thoroughly the science and art of orches- 
tration. 
Personal qualities. The principal, above all others, 
must have learned to hold himself well in hand. In 
all his relationships, he must avoid misinterpreting 
the power which his office gives him. 
It may conjure up for him a personal influence that has no 
material existence. He who would protect himself from such 
delusions will take care not to make his official position too
-P-A-G-E-219
  THE PRINCIPAL AS DISCIPLINARIAN 207 
prominent in the eyes of his pupils. [And we may add, in the 
eyes of his teachers or of the public.] On the contrary, he 
will be anxious to keep the barrier of officialdom from com- 
ing between his pupils and himself, that the only true edu- 
cational force, the greatest that we possess, the force of 
personal influence, may exert itself unhampered.? 
Executive ability. The principal must possess, in 
addition to teaching skill, that peculiar quality known 
as executive ability. It is his function to set in motion 
the wheels of the school machinery and to keep them 
running easily and noiselessly. Above all else, the 
principal must possess calm and cool judgment. He 
stands at the center of the school and has a broader 
horizon than has any one of the teachers. He should 
modify the work and attitude of each teacher in the 
light of his larger vision. He should be the steadying 
influence in the school. The most helpful quality he 
may possess is that of constancy, by reason of which 
teachers and pupils alike know that they will always 
find in him the same calm advisor and arbiter. 
Subordinating routine. The principal must fight 
against the stifling effects of routine and must throw 
his energies into the more influential side of his work. 
Every administrative position of necessity involves 
routine. The principal cannot ignore it, but he need 
not die of it. He must take desperate means, if neces- 
sary, to free himself from its clutches. For one thing, 
he will study to master it himself, and for another, he 
2 Hermann Weimer, The Way to the Heart of the Pupil, p.85.  ~
-P-A-G-E-220
208 DISCIPLINE AS A scHoor PROBLEM 
will, within reason, unload the actual performance of 
it upon others. In addition, the principal, as well as 
saving himself, will guard against letting his teachers 
become tied up by routine. The secret of success in 
the conduct of a factory is mechanical efficiency. Ad- 
mirers of machinery are apt to work upon the schools 
in an attempt to reduce education to a mechanical 
process. They would restrict the teacher’s work to 
the simple task of pouring in material and turning 
out product. 
The principal will undoubtedly. gain something 
from Mr. Harrington Emerson’s The Twelve Princi- 
ples of Efficiency,! even though the book is written 
with industrial organizations in mind. He will do 
well especially to ponder Mr. Emerson’s statement: — 
Since life began on our planet there have always been two 
types of organization, types that Mr. F. W. Taylor char- 
acterizes as functional and as military. The former is an 
organization to build up, the latter an organization to 
destroy.

Influence. Along with this constant striving to pre- 
vent the demands of routine from overwhelming him 
and thus impairing his influence, the principal must 
_be alert to keep fresh and full the well-springs of his 
influence. ‘Influence cannot rise above the level of 
our lives,’? says Hugh Black. It behooves the 
principal, if he is to be the steadying, uplifting influ- 
ence in his school, to nurture all the elements that 
may possibly contribute to his own growth. Mr. 
Black concludes: — 
The result of our friendship on others will ultimately be 
- conditioned by the sort of persons we are. It adds a very 
sacred responsibility to life. Here, as in other regions, a 
good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree 
bringeth forth evil fruit.

CHAPTER XXVII 
THE PRINCIPAL AND THE PUPILS — 
The four groups the principal meets. The school 
exists for service to the pupils. As the immediate serv- 
ice is rendered by the teachers, the problem, for the 
principal, of discipline within the school is the double 
problem of getting results directly from the pupils 
and indirectly through the teachers in their rela- 
tion to pupils. Moreover, the parents of the pupils 
are an unquestioned factor in the situation, as are 
also those educational and other authorities who come 
in touch with the school. The genius of the princi- 
pal, therefore, will find expression in the relationship 
which he establishes and maintains between himself 
and the four chief groups of people: the pupils, the 
teachers, the parents, and the authorities. 
In touch with the pupils. It is of first importance 
that the principal should recognize school spirit and 
develop it into something that is fine in its devotion 
and effective in its influence. There are various ways 
in which he will gain this esprit de corps. Chief of 
these is the direct influence of the principal’s person- 
ality upon the pupils as he comes into daily contact 
with them in the various phases of the school work. 
Of course, a principal spread out over two thousand
-P-A-G-E-223
  
THE PRINCIPAL AND THE PUPILS) 211 
pupils is spread out “pretty thin.” However, the 
management of his school daily takes him into the 
classrooms for one purpose or another, and his class- 
room intercourse with the pupils. throughout the 
school betrays him as he is. The pupils may not 
consciously form a judgment. of him, but. they at 
least have an unconscious estimate of him which is 
a potent force for good or otherwise. 
If the personality of the principal breathes forth 
justice, firmness, kindness, understanding, and sym- 
pathy, his influence is felt to greater or less degree by 
every soul in his school. When he talks in the class- 
room he must exhibit the qualities of the teacher par 
excellence. His method must. be enlivening, intelli- 
gent, skillful. His good nature must be in evidence, 
but without loss of the dignity due his position. In 
his questioning of pupils he will discover the individual 
and learn to know him. In the give-and-take of the 
classroom he will show that he is very just, and ever 
ready to consider the individual. It is wise for the prin- 
cipal to go further and to schedule himself regularly 
for stated periods of class instruction. By this the 
pupils will learn to know him as human, and the 
rapport that he thus establishes will lead the pupils 
to range themselves on his side in disciplinary con- 
troversies. 
Strengthening the teacher. Further strengthening of 
discipline comes through the attitude of the principal 
toward the teacher in her classroom. His recogni-  
-P-A-G-E-224
212 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
tion of her as the administrative head of the class 
must be in evidence, even though subtly. The prin- 
cipal will show a peculiar deference to the teacher 
in all that he says to her in the presence of pupils. 
{All criticism of her, in fact everything that comes as 
the result of the necessity for his instructing her, will 
be done out of sight and hearing of the pupils. Children 
have a certain respect for official position. They natu- 
rally place the principal upon a higher plane of author- 
ity than they do the teacher. If the principal seems 
invariably to regard the teacher as a person to be 
greatly respected, the pupils themselves catch this 
spirit and are likely to form this same opinion of her) 
Moreover, as the principal enhances the measure of 
the teacher’s authority in the eyes of the pupils, he 
also increases their idea of his own authority. | 
The school assembly. One.of the prime instruments 
for the gaining of school spirit is the assembly. If 
the arrangement of the building and the daily pro- 
gram permit it, the attendance of every pupil on as- 
sembly every day is none too much. Under most con- 
ditions, however, it is impossible for pupils to meet 
so frequently. ‘Especially valuable is the assembly of 
the upper-grade pupil: ‘he exercises should be ar- 
ranged particularly with the view of unifying the 
pupils in common devotion to the school. )The assembly 
helps to start the day off right, by amalgamating the 
thought of the pupils, centering it upon the idea that 
they are all one school. The principal will do very

  THE PRINCIPAL AND THE PUPILS” 2138 
little preaching, and yet he will be able skillfully to 
give to every exercise some touch. of idealism that 
shall operate in the elevation of ideals. He will show, 
for example, that whatever commemoration we may 
make of heroism in our country’s history, whatever 
feeling of patriotism may be started within us, it 
must be brought down in practical application to the 
needs of the present moment and the present locality. 
The salute to the flag means not only a salute to 
America, but a salute to one’s own city or village. The 
vague ideal of patriotism must be reduced to con- 
crete application in local civics. | Moreover, the prin- 
cipal must keep constantly before the higher-grade 
pupils the fact that they stand as examplars before the 
younger pupils of the senoals The admiration which 
they, when they were in the lower grades, felt for the 
pupils ‘“‘on the top floor,” may profitably be recalled 
to show them what an influence they now have and 
how they may wield this influence for the good of the 
school. 
' Alumni connections. Another means for the develop- 
ment of school spirit is the hold which the principal 
may establish upon the alumni through one means or 
another. He may encourage the formation and continu- 
ance of a strong alumni association. Such an associa- 
tion will havea bearing upon discipline in two ways. 
Pupils, knowing of the activities of the association, 
will look forward to the time when they may partici- 
pate. This adds one more motive for them to accom- |
-P-A-G-E-226
  214 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
plish the work of the day and to gain graduation from 
the school. On the other hand, the alumni may have 
an influence in the discipline of individuals, inas- 
much as graduates of a school directly influence the 
school conduct of their younger brothers and sisters. 
In addition to encouraging alumni associations the 
principal may establish cordial informal relations with 
the alumni as individuals, by indicating a continued 
interest in their affairs, aiding them in securing em- 
ployment, etc. 
Other instruments for the development of school 
morale are all the so-called “extra-activities” of the 
school. In fact these extra activities must stand or 
fall upon their value as factors in the development of 
this morale. The student clubs and associations, even 
though they may originate in the desire to assist pu- 
pils in the development of certain subjects in the cur- 
riculum, cannot long continue unless they contribute 
also to the spirit of the school. Among these or- 
ganizations are to be mentioned athletic associa- 
tions, walking clubs, dancing clubs, school gardens, 
school journals, ete. 
Pupil self-government. Something may be gained 
by the establishment of some form of pupil self-govern- 
1 Tn the public schools of many of our large cities, notably New 
York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Cleveland, St. Paul, Portland, 
Oregon, Dayton, Los Angeles, school gardens are officially recog- 
nized, encouraged, and supported. The School Garden Association 
of America has organized in nearly every State, and in every Province 
of Canada. A bibliography on school gardens will be found in 
Sneath-Hodge’s, Moral Training in the School and Home, p. 184.
-P-A-G-E-227
THE PRINCIPAL AND THE PUPILS) 215 
ment. The School Citizens’ Committee, 2 Wall Street, 
New York, issues pamphlets urging the organization 
of pupil codperation plans, on the thesis “It is gener- 
ally conceded that pupil codperation in school govern- 
ment can be successfully carried out in the sixth, 
seventh, and eighth years of the elementary school and 
throughout the high school.” In the establishment and 
conduct of any plan, certain points are to be remem- 
bered. The character of the plan used, and its success, 
depend upon local conditions such as size of school, 
experience of the teachers, kind of neighborhood, etc. 
No plan will run itself — teachers and principal will 
have to give it constant supervision. The experiment 
of employing formal schemes of government must not 
be attempted with pupils below the adolescent stage: 
that is, only pupils who have reached the ability to 
debate moral issues can be taught to govern one an- 
other. Finally, it must never be forgotten that the goal 
of education is to put the individual in a position of 
authority over himself. Moral education is educa- 
tion toward self-government. When every pupil has 
gained the ability to govern himself, the condition is 
the happy antithesis of “pupil self-government” usu- 
ally so called, which is merely one pupil governing 
another.
-P-A-G-E-228
CHAPTER XXVIII 
THE PRINCIPAL AND THE TEACHERS 
The vigilant principal. The principal’s solution of 
the school problem of discipline depends not only 
upon his own direct influence upon his pupils, but also 
upon the relationship he establishes with his teachers, 
which in turn finds indirect expression in the handling 
of the discipline problem in each classroom. The at- 
mosphere thus created is of great value, but there is 
much else that the principal must do in helping his 
teachers to become disciplinarians. It is not to be ex- 
pected that the teachers will themselves discover all of 
their own mistakes in discipline./It remains for the 
vigilant principal to call their attention to their short- 
comings as he may see them from the vantage-point 
of his central position in the school. 
The new teachers, in particular, require detailed 
directions on disciplinary questions; the principal 
gives them specific “Do’s” and “Don’t’s.” At the 
same time he will endeavor to lead them to perceive 
the fundamental principles underlying the devices 
he prescribes. Teachers must be trained to make the 
knowledge of these principles so much a part of them- 
selves that they will instinctively follow them through- 
out all the work of the day. Even with the more
-P-A-G-E-229
THE PRINCIPAL AND THE TEACHERS 217 
experienced teachers it is the principal’s duty to en- 
courage them, when the moments of depression arrive, 
to take a better view of the situation. He will watch 
for symptoms of nerve strain and loss of tone and 
thus forestall breakdown. He may occasionally see the 
need of relieving a teacher from class duty for an hour 
or so while she recovers her poise, in the meantime 
making some arrangement for the disposition of her 
class. Every school should have its rest-room for 
teachers — and, in the interest of efficiency, it should 
be used. 
Preventing “ settling.”? One condition into which 
teachers may slip will be forestalled by the alert 
principal. There is a type of teacher who “settles,” 
the teacher of ten or twelve years experience who 
has been for some time in the same grade. There is 
serious danger that she will soon reach the point of 
arrest if not a condition of actual retardation. If at 
this time she starts on the road of retrogression she is 
little likely to return. As the years go on she becomes 
less and less skillful in handling her class. She acquires 
a certain stock way of doing the class exercises and of 
disposing of disciplinary matters, and is thoroughly 
satisfied with herself. The situation may be aggravated 
in the case of teachers of the lowest grades, where two 
or three special factors operate to discourage growth. 
For one thing, the subject-matter of the low grades is 
so simple that there is little demand upon the teacher 
to enlarge her cultural horizon. Again, work with small 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  218 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
children means constant leaning over to direct them, 
so that the teacher is prone to fall into the attitude of 
hollow-chestedness and round-shoulderedness which 
in time has its effect upon her mental life. The prin- 
cipal must take heroic measures in such a case, trans- 
ferring the teacher to a class of higher grade where 
she will be compelled to pull herself out of her settled 
condition. 
Supporting teachers. The more direct business of the 
principal in securing good discipline through his 
teachers is to support them in specific cases of misde- 
meanor. Every pupil should feel that teachers and 
principal are all working together for the maintenance 
of school spirit and for the upholding of the arm of the 
law. Every teacher should know that the principal 
stands squarely in support of her in her just adminis- 
tration of class affairs. Teachers and pupils alike 
should be conscious that there is vested in the princi- 
pal an authority that will be wielded consistently, 
justly, wisely, and in kindness of spirit. 
In general, we may say that the principal should 
support the teacher in the presence of her pupils, even 
though she may have used poor judgment. The justi- 
fication for doing so is not based upon regard for the 
feelings of the teacher or any other personal motive. 
The teacher is sustained because it is due to the pupil 
that his confidence in the intelligence and ability 
of the teacher shall not be shaken. This applies, of 
course, only to pupils below the adolescent stage. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
  
THE PRINCIPAL AND THE TEACHERS 219 
the later period such an attitude cannot safely be 
taken, and the judgment of the teacher may be open 
to review by the principal and by the teacher herself, 
without necessarily damaging the respect that the 
pupils have for her. 
The principal and the parent. The attitude of the 
principal before the parent, in regard to supporting 
the teacher, right or wrong, is another matter. Again 
speaking only in general terms, we may lay down the 
principle that he may support her when she is peda- 
gogically wrong, but not when she is legally wrong. 
For example, if an inexperienced teacher in her ignor- 
ance, or an experienced teacher in a moment of aber- 
ration, assigns a school task as a punishment, the 
principal, provided the task is not unreasonably 
severe in proportion to the offense, may well take the 
position with the parent that the teacher is justified. 
The teacher in this case has violated no law except 
that of good pedagogy. On the other hand, if the 
teacher inflicts corporal punishment upon a pupil 
when it is expressly prohibited by law, the principal 
must be outspoken in his condemnation. If there are 
circumstances which justify his giving some meas- 
ure of relief to the teacher, he can do so only by ap- 
pealing to the parent’s sympathy or sense of justice. 
‘In making this appeal to the parent he should admit 
at the outset that the teacher violated the law, that 
she ought to be punished, and that he is prepared to 
prefer the charge against her; but the principal goes fen 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
a | j 
220 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
further. He states the circumstances, emphasizes the 
provocation, and appeals to the parent as to whether 
he wishes to be responsible for the further humiliation 
of a teacher who is already contrite. In every case 
when the principal supports the teacher in one way 
or another in her violation of either sound pedagogy or 
specific law, he must not leave the matter until it has 
been definitely and thoroughly settled with the teacher 
that she has been in error and that a repetition of the 
error cannot be condoned. 
| Corporal punishment. Further reference may be 
made to the subject of corporal punishment. When 
it is permitted by law, certain restrictions should be 
put by the principal upon its use, even if they are not 
included in the general regulations. For instance, it 
should not be administered by the teacher who makes 
tice ata the oa boul beaded 
nly before 7 witnesses; it ‘should be used as practically 
a last resor' iat resort; it should be be, used only after-every-effort 
to.compel parents ents to administer it has failed. 
There is a present-day tendency to some loose 
thinking and false sentimentalizing on the subject of 
corporal punishment. No sane teacher wants to ad- 
minister it. Given the authority to use it, every skill- 
ful teacher appeals to it infrequently, and unskiilful 
teachers should be developed to a point of skill. 
Under the restrictions, self-imposed by every compe- 
tent teacher, the performance of the disagreeable 
duty is no more degrading than the work of the
-P-A-G-E-233
  3 THE PRINCIPAL AND THE TEACHERS 221 
judge or the sheriff. Dr. Hall puts it fairly when he 
says: —¥ 
Dermal pain is far from being the pitiful evil that senti- 
mental and neurasthenic adults regard it, and to flog wisely 
should not become a lost art, whether with criminals or 
in normal families, although, of course, other very different 
influences should supplement it. Wo 
Sensible interpretations of punishment. When 
corporal punishment is prohibited by law, there is 
still room for sensible interpretation. Such a law, 
written in the supposed interest of the pupil, cannot 
take from a teacher her right of self-defense. Nor can 
it be argued that the State, in depriving its agent 
of the power to inflict bodily pain as a punishment, 
means thereby to give up its own power to compel 
respect for authority. The State, through its teacher, 
has the right to command a pupil, for instance, to 
leave the classroom to report to the principal for some 
misconduct. If the pupil refuses, either agent of the 
State, the principal or the teacher, must be deemed 
to have power to enforce its decree. It cannot be held 
that the recalcitrant pupil is to_be “fo-con: 
; tinue to defy the State. 
If the pupil makes active resistance to the State’s 
agents, certainly those agents must be empowered 
to use such measure of force as is needed to carry out 
the will of the State. Hence, whatever bodily pain may 
come to the pupil through his unlawful resistance to

properly constituted authority cannot be construed 
as the result of corporal punishment administered by 
the teacher. Any charge against the teacher would 
have to show that she used force in material excess 
of that needed to compel obedience. 
We see, then, that the principal should carefully 
instruct his teachers as to the punishments allowed 
them by the rules of the governing boards and by his 
own regulations,
-P-A-G-E-235
CHAPTER XXIX 
THE PRINCIPAL AND THE PARENTS 
The parent and the school. The principal must 
assume that the parents of his pupils are at least as 
much concerned with the normal welfare of their chil- 
dren as he is. It is all too true that he will find some 
parents who seem not to show a proper interest in the 
moral development of their children, but he will con- 
tinue to act as though all parents recognized their 
duty in the matter. In this age of philanthropy, 
paternalism, and sumptuary laws, there is grave 
danger that parents will neglect the full responsibility 
of their parenthood., For men to look to the State 
or other agencies for the support of their families, 
or for them to come to depend upon help that will 
enable them to shirk their duty toward their children, 
is to lower the standard of citizenship. Hence it is a 
duty of the school not to accept responsibilities that 
belong to the parents. 
The parent may .assume-that-the-teacher. will in- 
struct his child intellectually and morally, but he can- 
not rightfully expect the teacher to.devote a widely 
disproportionate part of her time in coaxing his child 
to conduct himself in accordance with fully recog- 
nized rules of decorum...It is not expected that the
-P-A-G-E-236
224 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
parent shall actually take the place of the teacher in 
the performance of her normal duties;\but when the 
misconduct of the child goes beyond the reach of 
the ordinary classroom methods of a skillful teacher, 
it is reasonable to expect the parent to codperate in 
securing proper discipline. 
The parent and punishment. Particularly when 
there is need of punishment, the parent may properly 
be appealed to for various reasons, some of which are 
enumerated. A large class puts upon a teacher de- 
mands that make it unreasonable for her to expend 
on unruly individuals time and energy that belong 
to the class as a whole. The teacher may assume 
that the parent prefers to mete out punishment to his 
own child rather than have it administered by some 
one else. The range of punishments at the disposi- 
tion of the teacher is meager as compared with those 
of the home. Especially as to corporal punishment, if 
used at all it should be administered by the parent — 
the teacher may claim this without question in those— 
places where the law has withdrawn from her the right 
to use it. Again, in the home there is the possibility 
of substituting for it several other forms of punish- 
ment, not so severe but just as effective, that are not 
feasible or available in the schoolroom. 
Parent codperation desirable. Hence it becomes 
a duty for the principal to secure as high a degree of 
parent codperation as he can. There are many ways 
in which he may cultivate a close relation between the
-P-A-G-E-237
THE PRINCIPAL AND THE PARENTS 225 
parents and the school. In fact, anything is an ad- 
vantage that brings parents into the school building. 
If the citizen knows, by actual observation, what the 
inside of the school building is and what the activities 
of the school organization are, the quality of his citizen- 
ship is sure to be improved. This applies to all per- 
sons whether they may have children on the register 
of the school or not, but it applies particularly to pa- 
rents of the pupils. To understand is to sympathize 
with; if the parent understands the school, its aims in 
service to the children, he will sympathize with that 
purpose and will the more readily uphold the school 
in effecting it. 
Parents’ meetings. The principal and teachers will, 
therefore, take every opportunity to advertise that 
the school issues a standing invitation to all people to 
enter its portals and familiarize themselves with the 
work going on. It is, however, necessary to do more 
than issue such a general invitation. Hence the school 
will organize formal parents’ meetings at which parents 
of particular groups of pupils, if not of all the pupils 
of the school, are given a special invitation to see the 
regular class work carried on by their children. \The 
program at these meetings should involve as many of 
_ the activities of the school as it is possible to present, 
and should avoid the exhibit of special talent) The 
pupils may, for instance, write the invitations in a 
regular penmanship lesson and draw the decorative 
design on them in their drawing period. When the
-P-A-G-E-238
  
  226 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
parents arrive, examples of the regular work should be 
on exhibition, and exercises of the special activities, 
such as singing, physical training, dramatization, 
etc., should be demonstrated. The effect upon disci- 
pline of such a meeting is evident. This does not mean 
that the teacher will specifically call attention to the 
deficiencies of pupils. On the contrary, the teacher 
has the opportunity of commending the work of each 
pupil to the parents and at the same time adroitly 
to place before them the telling comparison of their 
child’s work with the average work of the class. 
Parents’ associations. Parents’ associations have 
their place in the scheme of codperation. These are, 
of course, more effective if they develop on the initia- 
tive of the parents. If they do not evolve thus spon- 
taneously, the principal may skillfully bring about 
their organization. He should be careful, however, 
not to take too active and prominent a part in their 
proceedings. In some schools associations compris- 
ing both the parents and the teachers are found ef- 
fective. 
Even with a flourishing parents’ organization, there 
will be many parents who are not brought into touch 
with the school. The only way in which they can be 
reached is through visitation either by the regular 
teacher or by a specially appointed visiting teacher. 
General community support. Aside from these 
stated efforts of the school to gain support from pa- 
rents, the present-day movement toward the wider  
-P-A-G-E-239
THE PRINCIPAL AND THE PARENTS 227 
use of the school building, making the school a social 
center of the community, contributes to a develop- 
ment of community spirit, with its consequent favor- 
able reaction toward the school in the minds of the 
parents. The more favorably the parents react in 
this way, the more likely are they to support the prin- 
cipal and the teachers in their efforts to discipline 
pupils intelligently and effectively. 
Moreover, the closer the community relates itself 
to the school, the closer the pupils feel themselves to 
be to the throbbing life of the community, and the 
more real the school exercises become to them. The 
more nearly adjusted the pupil feels to real life, 
the less likely is he to rebel in misconduct. 
Speaking of the value of home and school associa- 
tions in the development of a socially efficient educa- 
tion, Dr. King? says: — 
The underlying need expressed in such organizations is 
that all the forces in a community concerned with the educa- 
tion of the boys and girls should maintain a real interest 
in the enterprise, and should have their aims and efforts 
rather definitely correlated. Of course this correlation of 
efforts and aims is not all that is needful, but it is one thing 
that cannot be neglected; it is one phase that is vitally es- 
sential. There is no better way to make the children feel 
that their school training is worth while. Such organization 
of a community about its educational interests will keep 
these interests in vital touch with life, and will go far toward 
making the work in the school not mere preparation for life, 
but real participation in life itself.

CHAPTER XXX 
THE PRINCIPAL AND OTHERS 
Retaining the confidence of superiors. In addi- 
tion to the teachers, the pupils, and the parents of the 
pupils, there are many other persons with whom the 
principal holds official relationship. There is the series 
of school authorities. toward whom he is responsible 
for his official acts. (By his general good management 
of the school, the principal will develop in the minds of 
the authorities a well-grounded respect for his ability. 
to handle the problems of his school. Particularly is 
this necessary in order that he may maintain proper 
discipline within the aed TT obtains his position 
upon a presumption of abilii 
should be to confirm this presumption} If he develops 
a record of always exercising sound and sane judg- 
ment in the disposition of the routine affairs of the 
school, when the exceptionally difficult cases of dis- 
cipline arise he will be far better able to gain support 
in handling them. On the contrary, if his record is one 
of vacillation and continued errors in judgment, he is 
likely to find himself upon the defensive when he 
prosecutes a case. 
Courage in emergencies. There is also occasional 
demand for real courage on the part of the principal , and his constant care
-P-A-G-E-241
THE PRINCIPAL AND OTHERS 229 
in his administration of just discipline. Any timidity 
which he may show at such times will reflect itself in 
the resulting morale of the school. The law is con- 
structed with the intention of supporting the school 
authority in all its reasonable demands for obedience 
and respect on the part of the pupils. It expects, of 
course, that the teachers shall use professional skill 
in the art of control of pupils so that the appeal to 
law shall be infrequent. When there is this necessity 
of appeal, however, every teacher should feel that the 
principal stands ready to make the appeal unflinch- 
ingly. He cannot afford to let ulterior motives, such 
as furtherance of his personal ambitions, interfere with 
the performance of his duty. It requires a nicely bal- 
anced skill on the part of the principal to convince 
teachers that he aims first to help them to improve 
their art of pupil control, but that, at the same time, 
he is ready, when necessity requires, to supplement 
their art with the full vigor of the law. 
Then, too, the principal will frequently encounter 
interference — some of it well-meaning — with his 
disposition of disciplinary cases. Here he must use his 
judgment as to whether, in the interest of the pupil 
concerned, he shall accept proffers of outside help 
or rebuff the eager efforts of those who are interfer- 
ing ill-advisedly. 
Relation to other civic agencies. There are various 
other authorities, departments of state or city govern- 
ment, with which the principal has certain relations.  
-P-A-G-E-242
  280 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
His general policy will be to assume that the officers of 
these departments are as sincere in their labors as he 
is himself. In a large city system, he will have rela- 
tions with the Health Department in regard to the 
work of school doctors and nurses. Having developed 
a friendly codperation, he will find it of distinct serv- 
ice in certain classes of disciplinary cases; that is, to 
those where there is any question of physical condi- 
tions that impair will strength of pupils. 
The principal and the police. The relation of the 
principal toward the police will also be one of friendly 
coéperation and yet of clear distinction as to juris- 
diction and responsibility. The principal must be 
careful not to permit himself to be made an adjunct 
to the police department in its attempt to prosecute 
offenders against the law whose offenses are not com- 
mitted on school property or under school jurisdiction. 
The extent of the jurisdiction of the principal is fairly 
well defined, and all cases that go beyond this should 
be referred to the proper police officials. Otherwise 
the principal will find himself liable to criticism, — if 
not for damages, —for interfering in cases outside his 
jurisdiction. 
For example, the police, on the complaint of a citi- 
zen, or the citizen himself, may charge that pupils in 
the school are committing depredations on property 
in the neighborhood. The attitude of the principal 
should be that, if the fact is as stated, he deplores it. 
His disciplinary jurisdiction, however, cannot extend
-P-A-G-E-243
  THE PRINCIPAL AND OTHERS 281 
to such an offense and it is the business of the police 
to discover and punish the offenders. Nevertheless, 
the principal will recognize that it is his duty to make 
further efforts in the instruction of his pupils in good 
citizenship, so that they shall not repeat their offense. 
In other words, the function of the principal and his 
teachers is not to act in the place of properly con- 
stituted police officers in the ferreting out of misde- 
meanors and awarding punishments therefor, but it is 
to create proper ideals and to encourage good con- 
duct on the part of the pupils at all times. 
Fire and street department relations. The principal 
should have cordial relations with the fire department, 
and would do well to have conferences with the officers 
of the nearest fire company so that both he and they 
may do their respective parts in protecting the prop- 
erty of the school and the lives of the pupils. If pupils 
are alive to this codperation, their interest in the fire 
drills will be expanded and their conduct proportion- 
ately improved. 
There seems a tendency on the part of some officials 
to attempt to transfer some of their responsibilities 
to the school. For instance, the street-cleaning com- 
missioner may see in the great army of school children 
possibilities of organizing supplementary street-clean- 
ing brigades. It is clearly a function of the school to 
teach practical civics to its pupils. Each individual 
should be taught that it is his duty to‘obey street ordi- 
nances in regard to the littering of streets, etc. But
-P-A-G-E-244
232 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
it would seem to be better teaching of citizenship to 
instill in pupils’ minds the fact that the city has a 
street-cleaning department and that its employees 
are to be held to the performance of their duties, rather 
- than that the pupils themselves should be sent into the 
streets to do the work for which these employees are 
paid.
-P-A-G-E-245
CHAPTER XXXI 
MECHANIZING SCHOOL ROUTINE 
We have noted the value to the teacher of mechan- 
izing the routine work of her class. In the larger field 
of the school, the principal similarly must study to 
mechanize all those elements of routine that are com- 
mon to the work of the various classes. He must pro- 
vide for the establishment and observance of such 
rules and regulations as will take care of the school 
during the intervals that correspond to the “between- 
times” in the classroom so bothersome to the inex- 
perienced teacher. 
Restrictions upon teachers. .The principal should 
have a definite understanding with the teachers as to 
what restrictions he is obliged to place upon their 
exercise of disciplinary authority.’’These restrictions 
are of two classes, and it should be clearly understood 
as to which of these each belongs. In the first place, 
the principal must train teachers to observe the 
general principles underlying proper class manage- 
ment. He must define for them the various disci- 
plinary devices that contravene the laws of pedagogy, 
and hence are to be prohibited. ” 
In addition, the principal is obliged to place upon 
teachers certain other restrictions created by the fact
-P-A-G-E-246
234 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
of the school. An instance has already been noted 
—prohibiting teachers from excluding pupils from 
the classroom for disciplinary purposes. An important 
restriction under this head is that placed upon teach- 
ers in regard to written communication with parents. 
There are many reasons why the teacher should not 
be permitted to write indiscriminately to the parents 
of her pupils. This regulation not only protects the 
teacher, but finds its further justification in the fact 
that all letters from the school to the parent should 
be written in proper form on appropriate stationery, 
and that the subject-matter thereof should be couched 
in courteous and dignified language. Teachers in the 
stress of disciplinary difficulties are prone to neglect 
these requirements. 
Use of forms. It is not sufficient that the principal 
shall place these prohibitions upon the teachers’ exer- 
cise of authority. He must provide adequate substi- 
tutes to compensate for these negative limitations. 
For example, if teachers may not exclude pupils from 
the room, they should be told what alternative they 
may employ. If they are prevented from writing 
letters to parents, they should be given certain letter 
forms which they may use.! In this connection it is 
to be stated that no system of letter forms should 
be installed that is not subject, from day to day, to 
1 A more detailed account of this subject, together with sample 
note forms, will be found in the author's The Management of a 
City School, p. 268 et seq.
-P-A-G-E-247
  MECHANIZING SCHOOL ROUTINE 235 
amendment and revision. Teachers themselves can 
frequently recommend new forms that may be re- 
quired. Moreover, in special cases not covered by the 
regular forms, teachers should be encouraged to submit 
original letters to the principal for his indorsement. 
Until he knows his teachers well, the principal must 
carefully visé these letters. In time he will learn which 
of his teachers may be trusted to write letters properly, 
and in these cases he need give no more than a per- 
functory glance over the notes submitted. 
Commendation of pupils. The principal should es- 
tablish some system whereby. he codperates with the 
teachers i in formal commendation of pupils. He may 
arrange to have pupils sent to him by the teachers at 
stated times, with some piece of work of particular 
excellence, or perhaps with a formal statement by the 
teacher as to the grounds upon which the pupil merits 
special approbation. From among the subjects used 
by teachers in practical experience I select the follow- 
ing at random: perfect order at fire drill; effort and 
posture during assembly; self-control under stress of 
temptation; excellence in penmanship drill; improve- 
mentin mathematics; superior work at the blackboard; 
great improvement in effort and work. These are not 
all along strictly disciplinary lines; but it contributes 
to the good conduct of pupils for the principal to notice 
favorably all the phases of their school effort. 
Ideals and authority. In discipline, as in other de- 
partments of school management, the principal not  
-P-A-G-E-248
236 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
only supervises. but.he.must previse. Indeed, it may 
be said that the quality .of his prevision is the surer 
test of his ability. He will take measures to prevent the 
development of situations conducive to misconduct. vi 
It is granted that the best disciplinary management 
of any school has for its aim the development of high 
ideals which shall operate in the daily conduct of the 
pupils. Nevertheless, the principal cannot trust his 
school to run merely on the momentum of the ideals 
that he and his teachers attempt to inculcate. The 
school is the scene of a constant migration. One set 
of pupils at the upper end of the school is no sooner 
trained to right action than another set is admitted 
at the lower end of the school whose training is a mat- 
ter of the future. In the light of this situation it is 
wise to build the superstructure of moral training 
upon a firm foundation of evident authority. It will 
not interfere with the proper development of ideals if 
the pupils have a feeling that wrongdoing will not pay, 
but will be detected in its incipiency and treated ac- 
cordingly. 
Preventive measures. One example as to what is 
meant by preventive methods may be cited. Reference 
has been made to the sending of notes from the school 
to the parent, in regard to the conduct of pupils. It 
is highly important that the school have assurance 
that these notes are delivered, especially if they are 
carried by the pupils themselves. Hence, it is well 
in every case to ask for the return of the note bear-
-P-A-G-E-249
  MECHANIZING SCHOOL ROUTINE 237 
ing the parent’s signature in acknowledgment. We 
cannot disregard the fact that there are pupils who 
are not above committing forgeries in order that 
the message of complaint may not reach the parent. 
Proper prevention may be secured by training teach- 
ers to scan the parents’ signatures with great care 
and to refer promptly to the principal every case 
where there is the slightest suspicion that a forgery 
has been committed.!| The principal will then with 
equal promptness take the necessary steps to deter- 
mine whether this is the fact or not. He is justified 
in punishing offenders severely, so that in time it 
shall become a tradition among the pupils that any 
attempt to interfere in the communication between 
school and parent will be unsafe and futile. 
Another line along which the principal exercises 
prevision may be noted. He should make and enforce 
such rules as shall give every class the greatest free- 
dom from interruption. Pupils truly interested in the: 
work of the class are not misconducting themselves. 
Their interest is based on attention. The teacher plans 
her period of work in accordance with well-considered 
aims. She is entitled to the opportunity to execute her 
plan without distracting intrusions. 
Minimizing interruptions. If, in the middle of her 
presentation, a pupil dashes into the room with a 
1 It is wise, at the time the pupil is entered on the register of the 
school, to secure the parent’s signature on the record card for com- 
parison in future correspondence.
-P-A-G-E-250
  238 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
message from the office, or a record book to be written 
in, or an armful of supplies, a disturbing strain is put 
upon attention. Moreover, the effects of the inter- 
ruption last many minutes after it occurs. The prin- 
cipal should so arrange the affairs of the school as to 
lead to a minimum of these diversions. 
The principal himself should avoid being a source 
of disturbance to the regular work of the class. If he 
has a definite message for the teacher or for the 
class, he may be justified in interrupting the careful 
plan of the teacher. But if he is merely making casual 
observation of conditions, he should do so as unobtru- 
sively as possible, and pupils and teachers should be 
trained to take little notice of him. Herein lies the 
argument against any formal salutation of the prin- 
cipal by the pupils of a class. In some schools, the 
appearance of the principal at the door is the signal 
for the class to stand and recite some formula of 
greeting. However pleasing this'may be to the vanity 
of the principal, it has at least the one disadvantage 
of being sure to occur at times when the teacher is 
entitled to freedom from interruption, even of this in- 
nocuous sort. Especially, would it seem to be a reflec- 
tion of low disciplinary ideals in a school when the 
appearance of the principal in the classroom causes 
a perceptible stiffening-up of attentive attitude. 
Naturally a certain number of interruptions in the 
course of the day is unavoidable, and on this account 
the class should be trained to accept them. The mo-
-P-A-G-E-251
  MECHANIZING SCHOOL ROUTINE 239 
ment the teacher turns from the class to give a visitor 
her attention, the pupils, of their own accord, should 
take up regular work. This may be merely the con-

impracticable, the devotion of every pupil to some 
form of study.

CHAPTER XXXII 
DISCIPLINE CASES 
Studying “ cases ” with teachers. To help teachers 
in their discipline the principal must..do. more than 
provide the various means of prevision and general 
supervision that have already been noted. He must 
illustrate general principles by the handling of specific 
cases. He must inspire teachers by his willingness to 
perform his share of direct disciplinary duty. This 
duty is, broadly, twofold — to give counsel to teachers 
upon their appeal, and to take over discipline cases 
formally reported to him by them. 
Each teacher, as she gains in experience and skill, 
becomes more and more independent of the principal. 
As she learns the arts of discipline she has less need of 
help. But throughout her apprenticeship, and even 
afterward, she should be encouraged to bring new 
phases of disciplinary pathology to the attention of the 
principal. He should study these cases with her, and, 
out of his larger experience, advise her as to her handling 
of them. Frequently he will propose certain methods 
by way of experimentation. It is important that the 
teachers respond in the right spirit. They should not 
take the attitude that they may unload troublesome 
cases on him and then stand off and criticize his
-P-A-G-E-253
DISCIPLINE CASES 241 
treatment of them. They must realize that the prin- 
cipal has only the same resources of his art that the 
teacher has, with a little more authority arising from 
his position. The spirit should always be one of codp- 
eration, felt by both principal and teachers — and the 
principal must make sure that he does codperate. 
Reporting “cases.”? The other of the principal’s 
chief disciplinary duties is to receive formal com- 
plaints from teachers/ There come times, even with 
the best of teachers} when it is necessary that the 
pupil shall feel the presence and strength of the prin- 
cipal’s authority. Pupils should be conscious that the 
teacher has always this superior authority at her 
command — and the principal must encourage this 
feeling. })When such situations arise, there should be 
somé regular form of established procedure which the 
teacher may follow. The more formal she makes the 
report of the pupil to the principal, the more effective 
it is likely to be. The entire class should appreciate 
the momentousness of the event. The pupil, once re- 
ported in this way, should be prohibited absolutely 
from reéntering the class until his “case” is settled.! 
The principal, in turn, will handle the case with 
necessary formality, and his disposition of it should 
be no less formal. The case may be one requiring 
constructive treatment, or one demanding punish- 
ment. In any event he may deem it wise to seek the 
1 See The Management of a City School, p. 270 et seq. for details of 
suggested scheme of report.
-P-A-G-E-254
242 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
codperation of the parents, or he may handle it alone, 
or work in codperation with other agencies. He may 
find it necessary to suspend the pupil, under the 
tules of his department. 
Suspension and expulsion. It may be well here to 
call attention to the distinction between suspension 
and expulsion. Expulsion is the depriving of a pupil, 
by vote of a school board, of the privilege of attend- 
ance upon a public school. The State places upon the 
parent the duty of educating his child during a certain 
number of its years. That duty remains upon the 
parent, even after his child has been expelled from 
a public school. A pupil suspended is merely at a 
point where his status is ill-defined. He is temporarily 
forbidden to attend a certain school, or the schools of 
a certain system, until his case is properly adjudicated. 
Expulsion is a “putting-out”’; suspension is “in the 
air.” 
The principal should never, as a consequent of 
misconduct, send a pupil out of the school building 
during a session except in the case of suspension. The 
parent has the right to expect that his child will be 
“housed” in the school during school hours. For the 
principal, in haste or anger, to order a pupil out of the 
building, “not to come back till your father comes 
with you,” or “until your case is settled,” is quite il- 
logical. 
Compulsion of parents. The principal, as well as his 
teachers, should be clear on the point that he cannot 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
    DISCIPLINE CASES WS 
“make”? parents come to school. He may request 
their codperation, he may make distinct threats of 
procedure if they do not come, he may take legal 
action against their children or them, but he cannot 
compel them to enter the school building, or even to 
write to him. How unwise it is, therefore, for the prin- 
cipal to attempt to settle cases along the line of com- 
pulsion of parents. 
If the principal finds it necessary to exclude a pupil 
from school, he should officially suspend him. This 
procedure, too, should be formal: as, for example, 
the principal sends for the janitor, and says: “This 
is Charles Smith. Charles, I hereby suspend you. 
This means that your case will be legally tried by the 
proper authorities, and that in the mean time you have 
no rights whatever inside of this building. Mr. Jani- 
tor, if at any time, until further notice, you find Charles 
in this building, you will eject him as a trespasser. 
Please escort him out of the building now.” 
Cases reported must be specific. Teachers must 
be permitted to report pupils for only specific offenses, 
never on general statements, such as “very disorderly.” 
No one would think of rushing into a physician’s 
office and saying: “ My child has a fever, give me some 
medicine for him quick.” Yet occasionally we find 
teachers taking much this attitude, rushing a boy to 
the principal’s office with a note: “John Jones is very 
disorderly — please attend to him.” The physician 
will naturally ask: “What are the symptoms?” and  
-P-A-G-E-256
  244 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
will prefer not to treat the case at all tmtil he has seen 
the patient and diagnosed the case for himself. So, 
too, the principal cannot be expected to handle his 
case without detailed knowledge of the symptoms. 
Nor can the principal accept reports complaining 
of the mental traits or attributes and attitudes of 
mind of pupils. Teachers are prone, for instance, to 
report pupils for “gross indifference to lesson,” and for 
“inattention’”’; but one cannot command indifference 
out of a child. So, too, teachers report pupils for 
“anger,” for “display of temper,” and the like. A 
man may kill his mother-in-law while he is in a rage of 
anger, or he might kill her out of pure joy. The chief 
thing that the jury is concerned with is the fact of the 
commitment of the murder. It does not give a verdict 
of “Guilty of Anger,” or “Guilty of Joy,” but of 
“Guilty of Murder.” 
If a pupil is reported for the specific offense of 
willfully breaking a window, the principal can handle 
it. Incidentally, in the course of his handling of it, he 
is likely to discover whether the boy broke the window 
in an angry passion or in a fit of ghoulish glee, and 
this will help to determine his disposition of the 
case. 
Orders vs. requests. Teachers must distinguish 
between the disobedience of orders and the non- 
compliance with requests. They should not report a 
pupil, for instance, for “refusing to do what I asked 
him.” Either the teacher commanded the pupil to
-P-A-G-E-257
DISCIPLINE CASES 95 
do the thing he refused to do, or else the pupil has 
exercised his presumptive right of choice in deciding 
whether he shall comply with a request. In one case 
there is willful disobedience, for which the pupil may 
be disciplined because he has deliberately set himself 
up in conflict with authority; in the other, he fails 
merely in judgment or manners, and should be pa- 
tiently taught to recognize his error. 
Pupils, teachers, and principal. The conduct of each 
child in school, as of every individual everywhere, is, 
as we have seen, dependent upon the functioning of his 
intellect, feeling, and will. It is not expected that all 
three of these are going to function properly in every 
action of every pupil. If it were so, we should prob- 
ably need no schools. The fact that there is much im- 
proper functioning is the occasion for sending children 
to school to be trained in proper functioning. Hence 
there is a lack of logic when a teacher reports to a 
principal, as a punishable offense, that a pupil has a 
meager intellect, or is lacking in ideals, or has a will too 
sturdy or too weak. It is her business — and that is 
exactly her business —to feed the intellect, to implant 
and nourish higher ideals, to encourage the feeble will, 
and to turn the masterful will into the mastery of bet- 
ter things. In the performance of this duty, she has 
the right to expect the hearty codperation and the 
wise guidance and counsel of her principal. He may, 
indeed, relieve her from responsibility for certain path- 
ological cases and find other modes of treatment for  
-P-A-G-E-258
  246 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
them, but when his codperation is to consist in the 
formal acceptance of a disciplinary “case,” the offense 
for which the pupil is reported should be a specific 
instance of misconduct.
-P-A-G-E-259
CHAPTER XXXTIT 
ANALYSIS OF CASES 
Normal and abnormal cases. In our introductory 
chapter it was pointed out that the work of the teacher 
in handling disciplinary cases is closely allied in its 
method with the work of the physician in treating 
medical cases. The teacher must understand the 
principles underlying mental development just as the 
physician studies to grasp the principles of physical 
development. And both physician of the body and 
physician of the mind must familiarize themselves 
with abnormal or pathological growth as well as with 
normal development. 
In the intervening chapters we have endeavored to 
set forth the more essential of these principles of devel- 
opment in accordance with which teacher and prin- 
cipal may administer discipline. In the last chapter 
we arrived at the point in management where the 
teacher, having exhausted her own resources, appeals 
to the principal, either formally or informally, for 
counsel or for definite assistance. We might easily 
stop here in our discussion, but probably it would be 
helpful to devote some space to a consideration of 
the chief specific forms of misconduct that trouble 
a school.
-P-A-G-E-260
  248 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
Analysis of “a case.” The principal will develop 
some automatically working analysis which he will 
apply to each case as it comes before him. A logical 
scheme to follow is: — 
(A) What type is the pupil? 
1. Normal. 
If so, (a) Are school conditions normal? 
(b) Are personal conditions normal? 
2. Abnormal. 
Tf so, (a) Is he supernormal? 
(6) Is he subnormal? 
(B) In what ontogenetic stage is the pupil? 
1. The ascent of childhood. 
2. The plateau of childhood. 
8. Prepubescence. 
4, Adolescence. 
(C) From which instinct-group is the specific offense de- 
rived? 
1. Self-preservative. 
2. Reproductive. 
3. Gregarious. 
4. Adaptive. 
(A) and (B) should both be determined before (C) 
is considered. The same specific offense will naturally 
be handled very differently when committed by an 
adolescent abnormal boy, for instance, and by a nor- 
mal girl on the plateau of childhood. 
As to (A) 1, the normal pupil is he who shows no 
marked divergence in physical condition or mental 
caliber from the majority of his age and sex. This 
does not necessarily mean the school-teacher’s “good”
-P-A-G-E-261
  ANALYSIS OF CASES 249 
boy or girl. It may, in fact, be more normal for the 
boy not to possess the kind of “goodness” the teacher 
looks for in her favorite pupil. 
Normal and abnormal conditions. Having decided 
that the pupil is himself normal, we determine (a) Are 
school conditions normal? One of the greatest hin- 
drances that a principal, however skillful, experiences 
in the handling of disciplinary problems is the fact 
that he must do so much of his work through inex- 
perienced teachers. While his teachers are learning 
their art they are necessarily making mistakes, and it 
is unfortunate that in one respect they are related to 
the ministers and lawyers and doctors, and not to the 
other group of artists who mold in clay or oils. These 
latter, in their mistakes, spoil only paint and paper 
and such material things; while the professional group 
gain their experience at the expense of human damage. 
The pupils suffer for the mistakes of those who are em- 
ployed to aid them. Theoretically, every pupil has 
the right to normal school conditions. Unfortunately, 
in practice, it is impossible to give them to him. 
Placing the new teacher. The principal cannot ex- 
pect to give more than a certain amount of time to 
1 In Social Development and. Education, Professor M. V. O’Shea 
has an interesting chapter (1x) on “Social Types” in which he groups 
children with respect to their general social “disposition.” His 
main grouping is into adaptable and unadaptable. Among the sub- 
types he treats are: the weak, the tactful, the impertinent, the frank, 
the deceitful, the communicative, the self-conscious, the dramatic, 
the hectoring, and the meek. The teacher and principal will recog- 
nize these as familiar types in their experience.
-P-A-G-E-262
250 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
the training of his new teachers, and he will start out 
by assuming that they are going to prove themselves 
intelligent and properly progressive. It is a good plan, 
however, for him to prepare for the worst. This he 
may do by not assigning his newly appointed teacher 
to the class that he expects her eventually to have. 
Instead, he slips the teacher of a near-by grade, hav- 
ing a private understanding with her as to his motive, 
into the class in question and assigns the new appointee 
to the other teacher’s room. Then, after a few days 
or so, when the new teacher has made her most seri- 
ous mistakes and has already profited by them and 
wishes that she “could begin all over again,” the 
principal is able to let her do just that. He sends her 
to her regular class where, profiting by her recent ex- 
perience, she repeats few of the same mistakes. In the 
mean time, the principal has needed to do little more 
in the cases of discipline that she has sent him than to 
“tide over” until the regular teacher returns, bring- 
ing normal conditions to the troubled pupils. 
In general, if school conditions are not normal, it 
is only fair to the pupil that they should be discovered 
and made normal. If this is absolutely impossible, 
then allowance must be made in dealing with pupils 
whose offenses are due to the abnormal conditions. 
Normal and abnormal personal conditions. Or, if 
conditions surrounding the pupil are approximately 
normal, we have yet to consider (6) Are personal 
conditions normal? By this is meant, Is the pupil
-P-A-G-E-263
  ANALYSIS OF CASES 251 
suffering from some transient state of discomfort? 
Is he in the incipient stage of some specific disease? 
Has he been fatigued through loss of sleep? Has he 
been worried by events at home; for instance, the 
serious illness of his mother? Is he flushed and fevered 
by an abnormally high temperature of the classroom? 
Is he in discomfort through the refusal of the teacher 
to permit him to visit the toilet? As to this last, quite 
frequent, source of disciplinary cases, an invariable 
tule may well be imposed upon the inexperienced 
teacher. She should grant all requests immediately and 
report the cases to the principal periodically or at the 
close of the day. He will readily determine whether 
advantage has been taken by individual pupils and 
check further abuse of the privilege. The first thing 
to be done, then, in all cases of temporary personal 
abnormal conditions, is to reform those conditions. 
Convince the pupil that he committed his offense 
because he was ill, or worried, or nerve spent, and he 
will “make good” by logical sequence. Then see 
that he is given opportunity to recover from his illness 
or his worry. 
Supernormal and subnormal. The principal may 
find that the child, instead of being normal, is to be 
classified under (A) 2. He then determines whether 
the pupil is (a) supernormal or (6) subnormal. Under 
(a) we find a few children whose development has 
been in one way or another precocious. There may 
be a heredity that makes for particularly keen
-P-A-G-E-264
252 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
mentality, a hypersensitive nerve organism, and a 
constantly “keyed-up” condition. Or, lacking these 
attributes by heredity, the child may be the victim 
of scholastic but unwise parents, who keep forcing 
precocity upon him. Or, in very rare cases, the child 
may be an out-and-out genius — an almost unaccount- 
able freak of nature. 
The problem of the supernormal. In any case, the 
supernormal pupil is likely to have a hard time of it in 
a public school. Teachers are apt to misunderstand 
him, and to apply ordinary standards to him. His com- 
parative brilliancy of intellect immediately classifies 
him in the mind of the ordinary teacher as a “good” 
boy. He makes an excellent showing in recitations and 
pulls up the “class average” in examinations. This 
very virtue makes it all the more incomprehensible to 
the teacher that he should misbehave. Yet his genius 
gets him into much trouble. Excited nerves demand 
constant readjustment, and, in readjusting, they lead 
him to various misdemeanors. His quick wit and alert- 
ness make much of the ordinary work of the class seem 
a bore; and when any pupil is bored he is ready for 
unorthodox proceedings. 
The principal will find the supernormal pupil one 
of his severest problems. It is perhaps more difficult 
to sympathize with this type, and to gain sympathy 
for him, than with the subnormal child, the pathos of 
whose case makes a strong appeal. The principal must 
get into thorough understanding with the parents of
-P-A-G-E-265
ANALYSIS OF CASES 253 
the supernormal child. He may have to point out 
to them ways in which their treatment of the child 
at home can be more intelligent. They may be urged, 
if they can afford it, to give him private instruc- 
tion with much time in the open, and with interests 
ordinarily not appealing to children of his age, or to 
enter him in a private school where classes are smaller 
and the possibility of individual attention greater. If 
this is not practicable, the principal will have to do the 
best he can, and perhaps transfer the pupil, even out 
of his grade, in order to place him with the teacher 
who has the keenest insight into his nature. 
Thesubnormal pupil. There is always, in any normal 
community, a certain proportion of (b) subnormal, 
pupils, reckoned variously from one to five per cent. 
Subnormal pupils include those who are, for any rea- 
son, dull beyond the natural expectation of their years, 
as well as those technically to be classed as feeble- 
minded. The principal should familiarize himself with 
some standard work on the subject! and prepare 
1 For example, Edmund B. Huey, Backward and Feeble-minded 
Children. His statement of the classification of the feeble-minded 
is (p. 6): — 
“The term ‘feeble-minded’ is to be used generically to include 
all degrees of mental defect due to arrested or imperfect mental 
development, as result of which the person so affected is incapable 
of competing on equal terms with his normal fellows, or of manag- 
ing himself or his affairs with ordinary prudence. 
“The feeble-minded are divided into three classes: Idiots. Those 
so defective that the mental development never exceeds that of a 
normal child of about two years. Imbeciles. Those whose develop- 
ment is higher than that of an idiot, but whose intelligence does not 
exceed that of a normal child of about seven years. Morons. Those

254 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
himself to discover promptly all cases of subnormality. 
When he finds such a case, he will first determine 
whether there is any remediable cause, such as 
physical defect. He will urge physical examination 
and proper treatment. If he is persistent, he may 
earry his point even with ignorant or recalcitrant 
parents. If the case is hopeless, he will transfer the 
pupil to a special class for the care of defectives. 
If there is no such class in his own or a neighboring 
school and he is unable to secure one, he will move 
for the commitment of the child to an institution for 
feeble-minded. If necessary he must raise the legal 
issue of the impropriety of the pupil’s remaining in a 
class with normal children and the consequent jus- 
tification of withholding from him the privilege of 
public school instruction. 
whose mental development is above that of an imbecile, but does 
not exceed that of a normal child of about twelve years.” 
He says also (p. 168): “It is evident from the studies that the 
high-grade feeble-minded fall naturally into certain groups; and 
from these groups I am convinced that one may pass by imper- 
ceptible gradations into corresponding classes of non-feeble-minded 
persons, normal and abnormal.” 
He makes the following grouping: (1) dull; (2) dull unstable; (3) 
unstable; (4) neurasthenically unstable; (5) hysterically unstable; 
(6) epileptic feeble-minded; (7) feeble-minded with tendency to 
insanity; (8) morally unstable; (9) deteriorated through injury, 
such as meningitis; (10) having local or partial defect of certain 
mental or physical functions; (11) relatively defective.

  ANALYSIS OF CASES 255 
Placing the pupil for disciplinary purposes. (B) 
The principal will determine not only the type of pupil 
he is dealing with, but also his age in the scale of in- 
dividual development. Particularly important is it 
that he shall know whether the child is in the second 
of the stages of school age, the plateau, or in the fourth, 
adolescence, or in the intermediate prepubescent, for, 
as we have discussed at some length, treatment will 
vary widely in accordance with this fact. 
(C) Passing to consideration of the specific com- 
plaint, the principal may seek to explain the offense in 
terms of phylogenetic development. We have noted 
that if the lately acquired moral instinct were in full 
command of the individual, the promptings of the 
lower instincts would be universally overcome and the 
individual would be morally perfect. In actual life, 
however, the weakly intrenched moral instinct is 
overwhelmed many times daily by the more ancient 
and primitive instincts. The treatment, then, is, in 
brief, to reinforce the moral instinct by the develop- 
ment of ideals that represent it. Often this will be 
done through the substitution of one of the inter- 
mediate instincts for that which in its malexpression 
has prompted the specific offense. 
Classifying the offense. It is not always easy, at the 
first moment, to classify an offense, for it is possible 
that it may be derived from one instinct or another, 
according to circumstances. For example, lying may 
be self-preservative or gregarious; the lie may be told »
-P-A-G-E-268
256 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
to save one’s self or to save the gang. Which it 
is, should be determined before treatment is under- 
taken. 
Among the school offenses that are directly trace- 
able to the self-preservative instinct are, besides lying, 
fighting, some cases of theft, and those misdemeanors 
that are committed in sudden outbursts of temper. 
It is well to throw against all of these the forces of the 
gregarious instinct. If the lie is to save one’s self, put 
the gang, or class, or community interest against it. 
Construe as many offenses as possible as against the 
group welfare and thus enlist the group sentiment as 
the corrective. As to a fight, if it is a natural, 
squared-off test of boy strength, overlook it, except 
on grounds of taste. The fair, fistic encounter is not an 
unhealthy expression of the primary instinct. If it 
occurs on school grounds, question it as to taste or 
dignity, or transfer it to another field of competi- 
tion; it is as logical to determine issues, for instance, 
by the contest of a broad-jump or a sixty-yard dash, 
or even a spelling match, as by pugilism. Boys of any 
age will readily see the humorous touch in this logic. 
The fight, however, that is an unfair one, an instance 
kof bullying, should be dealt with summarily. In a 
class of adolescents it may best be disposed of by the 
class, following a discussion of social justice. There is 
an inverse side to this, too. Some offenses committed 
by pupils, girls or boys, weak in will or in physique, 
are the result of their having been bullied into commit 
143 oS lo, 4),
-P-A-G-E-269
ANALYSIS OF CASES 257 
ting them. It is well to take the time to ferret out 
the original offenders in such cases. 
Dealing with petty thefts. The petty thefts that 
occur in school are frequently difficult to handle. In 
any village of five hundred, or in any town of twenty- 
five hundred inhabitants, there is a certain amount 
of dishonesty; hence, constables and courts and lock- 
ups. So it is not astonishing that in a school of five 
hundred or twenty-five hundred pupils, there is a 
corresponding amount of dishonesty. The result is 
that the principal is called upon to spend some of his 
time in the distasteful practice of the detective’s art. 
Extreme care should be exercised to avoid accusing in- 
nocent pupils. If pupils are to be searched for stolen 
articles, put the proposition before the class and have 
them ask for the privilege of thus demonstrating, 
presumptively, their innocence. In a large school, the 
principal may find some one teacher who has a special 
talent for unraveling these little mysteries, and he may 
regularly assign this teacher to run down the offenders. 
This is worth while, for vigilance is the price of free- 
dom from thievery. Moreover, it is only fair to the 
developing child that’ he be given all the help pos- 
sible in fighting the wrong expression of the instinct 
of acquisitiveness. And one of the aids, for the child, 
is to relieve him from witnessing the success of 
theft. 
Again, the character and motive of a theft must be 
well considered. An eight-year-old girl, attracted 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
  258 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
by the bright color, or by appetite, on the impulse of 
the moment snatching a red apple from the teacher’s 
desk, is a far different case from two youthful boys 
planning a robbery and carrying it out by breaking 
the lock of a desk and stealing the teacher’s purse. 
The one case is readily disposed of by reprimand and 
a petty punishment recognized by the little girl her- 
self as necessary if not “consequential.” It is well to 
make the other case a police matter and let the boys 
and their parents feel the force of the law, even if it 
involves no more than a “‘suspended sentence.” 
Profanity; obscenity; vulgarity. The reproductive 
instinct is responsible for much of the crime in the 
world at large, and it is natural that to it can be traced 
a certain proportion of school disciplinary cases. It is 
not until adolescence that this instinct is truly a first 
cause of misconduct. Two forms, for instance, that 
occur with preadolescents, — the use of obscene lan- 
guage and the practice of self-abuse, with its range of 
consequent misdemeanors in the class, — while dis- 
tinctly related to the reproductive instinct, are never- 
theless more directly chargeable either to the adap- 
tive instinct of curiosity, or to the gregarious instinct 
that says “Do as others do and stand well with the 
gang.” 
If curiosity is the immediate cause, it is to be re- 
directed into legitimate channels. When a boy is 
found thumbing his dictionary and marking sex words 
that have an interest chiefly because of their vague
-P-A-G-E-271
  
ANALYSIS OF CASES 259 
meaning to him, the average teacher is apt to fly into 
a rage with him and immediately report him as guilty 
of a great atrocity. The principal can best cover the 
case by going over the words with the boy, explaining 
their meaning to him in simple but scientific terms, and 
telling him that, now that he understands them, there 
is no longer anything mysterious about them, and the 
next thing to do is to turn his attention to some other 
subject of equal scientific interest — hygiene of the 
teeth, or eye, or lungs, for example, or wireless teleg- 
raphy, or aeroplanes. 
The reproductive instinct. At the adolescent stage, 
there is an increase in the misdemeanors traceable 
to the malexpression of the reproductive instinct. 
Girls are more liable to excesses than boys, for they 
are the racial conservers of the sex function and des- 
tined to a life of much more concern with this function. 
‘Teachers must be alert to discover girls who are cen- 
ters of interest on account of their sophistication. 
Every appeal must be made to win over these girls

In Educational Review, vol. 46, p. 168, will be found a valuable 
bibliography of sex hygiene. 
In The Seaual Life of the Child, Dr. Albert Moll has ernie an 
extended study of his subject. He makes the point that “an earlier 
awakening of the sexual life is commoner in those with an abnormal 
nervous system than it is in healthy persons; but it also appears that

amount of counsel and a large amount of athletics 
and other diverting interests. 
The gregarious instinct. The group instinct is re- 
sponsible for its share of school discipline. The indi- 
vidual boy or girl fears to stand for right-doing in the 
face of the group promptings to wrong-doing. There 
is, too, the ever-present desire to hold communication 
with one’s fellows. Two lines of correction are open —- 
training the individual to resist, and training the 
group to follow higher and juster ideals. 
Truancy. One of the chief of the school difficulties 
due to this instinct is truancy. It is rarely that a 
pupil is a truant by himself; almost invariably he 
travels in a crowd of at least two, and usually more. 
Truancy should be distinguished from other forms of 
non-attendance. These other forms include excusable 
and non-excusable absences, responsibility for the 
an abnormal sensitiveness of a non-pathological character, such as 
is exhibited by persons with the artistic temperament, and likewise 
a disposition excitable to a degree which cannot yet be called morbid, 
predispose the subjects to an early awakening of sexuality” (p. 148). 
‘Two other quotations of correlated interest may be given place: —- 
“Speaking generally, however, the question whether in the coun- 
try the sexual life awakens later than it does in the towns, cannot 
be said to have been decisively answered. . . . I myself do not believe 
that children are more moral in the country, or that they here re- 
main longer uncorrupted than in towns, whether large or small” 
(p. 152). 
“Here, of course, I make no attempt to offer a decisive opinion 
one way or the other upon the disputed question of coeducation of 
the sexes. My sole aim has been to show that certain of the objec- 
tions commonly made to coeducation, on the grounds with which 
we are especially concerned in this book, do not bear examination” 
(p. 268).

latter resting with the parents or guardians. True 
truancy is the deliberate absenting of himself by a 
pupil who knows that he ought to be in school. The 
truant, of all our offenders, makes a distinct claim on 
our sympathies. In any case, the call of the funda- 
mental, the ancient, is a stronger call than the call of 
the school, superficial and modern.! Beyond this gen- 
eral appeal to truancy, with which the principal and 
teachers may well openly express a genuine sympathy, 
there are specific causes which should be determined. 
Chief of these are (1) hereditary traits, (2) home con- 
ditions, (8) maladjustment to school work. 
The persistent truant is likely to be a type of ar- 
rested individual, not yet civilized away from the 
nomadic tendencies of primitive races. He must be 
taught to wrestle with himself continually. It is 
possible for him to transfer the expression of the roam- 
ing tendency from the real life to the realm of fancy. 
A good teacher will effect this transfer by giving him 
opportunities in the classroom to play truant through 
his imagination. 
A pupil is a truant through weakness of will or 
through strength of will. Capture the strong-willed 
1 Well phrased by Hermann Weimer, in his Way to the Heart of 
the Pupil. He says (p. 8): “The voice of nature cannot be silenced 
by any arguments, least of all in the case of the child. Wood and 
field with their gay splendor, the flowery meadow, the murmuring 
brook, the populous streets and the heavens bending over all with 
their sunshine and their rain; these are the natural elements of the 
child, the object of the child’s longing and joy, not the classroom 
with its bare gray walls.”
-P-A-G-E-274
262 DISCIPLINE AS A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
leader, and fix responsibility upon him for escorting 
the weak-willed follower to school. Thus are both 
strong-willed and weak-willed saved. 
Causes of truancy. Truancy may be due, too, to 
poor conditions at home. Low nutrition, unintelligent 
treatment by those at home, squalid surroundings, 
drive the boy to discontent so that he becomes full of 
the desire to run away. The good school will be such 
that when this boy runs away from home he will run 
toward school. If school gives him nothing, of course 
he will run away from both home and school. 
Maladjustment at school may be due to various 
causes. The teaching may be so poor as to drive a sen- 
sible boy away; while the teacher drones over memo- 
rized sentences from a geography textbook, the boy, 
alive, studies “exports and imports” at the docks 
where the stevedores are handling realities instead of 
dead lists of names. How much better for the teacher 
deliberately to appoint such a boy a committee of one 
to visit the docks and report back to the class. 'Tru- 
ancy, as well as many other cases of misconduct, is 
frequently due to misgrading of the pupil; he has too 
much work to do, or he has not enough to do. The 
remedy, of course, is to break through traditions and 
place the pupil where demand and ability are better 
balanced. 
Among the other offenses due to the gregarious in- 
> stinct are the social “vices,” such as gambling and 
smoking. These may be reached by appeal to the gang,
-P-A-G-E-275
ANALYSIS OF CASES 263 
setting the scientific interest to investigating the true 
“value” of the vicious habit. Dr. Hall hints at an- 
other cause of the nicotine and alkaloid habits in the 
adolescents, which he says may “owe part of their 
strength to nutritive needs, which might be better 
interpreted and thus lose their morbid character.” 1 
Adaptive instincts. The adaptive instincts yield 
their proportion of school misdemeanors. Play, imi- 
tation, curiosity — all distract from the prim order of 
the traditional classroom, and are responsible for most 
of the “‘general mischief” cases. The principal will 
frequently discover that pupils who are playful — 
particularly the younger ones — have had no legiti- 
mate opportunity for the exercise of the play instinct, 
that those who are inquisitive and restless have had 
no legitimate satisfaction of scientific interest. 
The work of the principal. No attempt has been 
made in this chapter to enumerate all the many va- 
rieties of school misconduct that come before the 
principal. It is hoped that enough have been cited, 
however, to show that the principal’s function is not 
merely to sit in judgment on pupils reported to him, 
to measure offenses with an arbitrary yardstick, and 
to mete out punishment — seventeen inches of mis- 
conduct, hence seventeen pounds of punishment. 
The principal will be much more — soul physician, 
astute, analytic, reflective, correcting, healing. And 
his teachers will pattern themselves after his ideal.

CHAPTER XXXIV 
CONCLUSION —THE PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE 
Regrettable presence of the problem of discipline. 
As one stands away and views again this problem of 
discipline in the school, he must regret that the writing 
of these thirty-odd chapters has been at all justifi- 
able. The physician, as he studies his materia medica 
and devotes his hours to the alleviation of distress, 
must be overwhelmed at times with the thought that 
so much of physical pain is utterly avoidable, inexcus- 
ably unnecessary. If the race would but apply the 
sound facts of science to their daily living, how little 
of disease and even of accident would remain to tor- 
ture the individual and to necessitate the remedial 
attention of physician and surgeon. So, toe, the 
thoughtful teacher must stand aghast at the task set 
before her—so much of it is merely to repair the dam- 
age deliberately or thoughtlessly done by the race of 
man to the children of men. 
If society were intelligent enough to look facts in the 
face and then strong enough to will them into the daily 
lives of its every member; if society’s governments 
were but the instruments of society’s determination to 
live rationally; if its government exercised its educa- 
tional function through agents devoted solely to the
-P-A-G-E-277
  THE PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE 265 
public weal; if its teachers were accomplished and in- 
spirited and remunerated with adequate though mod- 
est compensation; if its teachers of its young boyhood 
and young girlhood had the perspicuity of a Doctor 
Montessori; if its teachers of its young manhood and 
young womanhood had the inspiration of a William 
James, of whom it was written, “he was a manly and 
a radiant being. Loving and loved, he made all men 
think, and helped many a doubting soul to feel a 
man’s glow of hope and courage, each for his own 
work”’; ! if all these things were, then indeed would 
there be little left of the pettiness of the “problem 
of discipline.” 
Society has much to do before this program is at- 
tained. Eugenics must be recognized and vitalized; 
social institutions must be focused upon the creation 
of a nurturing environment for both childhood and 
manhood; and, chiefly, the institution “school” must 
learn to train its children in accordance with the laws of 
childhood and not with the pedantry of the “school.” 
The need for reconstruction. Chief among the 
more immediate causes of the existence of the dis- 
cipline “problem” are those of school organization; 
the school has yet to be subordinated to the pupils. 
This statement must be understood in its true sense. 
The school is not to be made the plaything of the 
pupils; childish whim is not to prescribe and rule the

school. But the State, whose agent the school is, must 
so develop its own comprehension of the needs of the 
children of the State, and above all realize that each 
child has his own peculiar needs, that it organizes 
its schools in a spirit of truer service to its children 
than it has yet attained. And who is to point out the 
way to Society and its State and its School? Let 
not the teachers abandon the task altogether to out- 
siders. They know the technical details better than 
do the laity. Let them supplement this special knowl- 
edge with a broad conception of the world so that 
they may become leaders in the reform of the insti- 
tution they serve. 
They may mount the lofty peak and from its van- 
tage-crest behold the earth and the inhabitants 
thereof. True, they will see much ignorance, much 
foolishness, much misery, much crime. But neither 
their contemplation nor their aloofness will serve to 
reduce, by one iota, these frailties of the world below. 
Only by descending and doing their share in the work 
of the world, and by inspiring others to mount the 
height whence is gained the vision, can they play their 
proper part in the great unfolding drama.

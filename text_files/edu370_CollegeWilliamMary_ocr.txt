DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BUREAU OF EDUCATION, 
Washington, D. C., January 20, 1887. 
The Honorable the SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, 
Washington, D. 0.: 
Str: The history of the higher education in the United States deserves 
organized inquiry and national attention. The origin, development, 
academic status, and practical usefulness of many of our older and bet- 
ter institutions of learning are scarcely known beyond their own scho- 
lastic environment. Documentary and manuscript material for such 
educational history and statistics is abundant, although often widely 
scattered, as will be seen by an examination of the bibliography ap- 
pended to the present sketch. 
The College of William and Mary, founded in 1693 by royal grant, 
and long supported by popular legislation in Virginia, has been suffered 
to decline almost to ruin since the civil war, which destroyed the greater 
part of its property. The oldest college in the South, in fact the oldest 
in the country with the exception of Harvard University, has been left 
to decay, while the latter institution, with which William and Mary Ool- 
lege used to share the annual income of the bequest by Robert Boyle, 
the English philosopher, has lately celebrated its 250th anniversary 
amid general rejoicing, with the President of the United States and rep- 
resentatives of American and European universities to do honor to the 
occasion. The old college at Williamsburg, which gave Washington his 
first degree as civil engineer and to which he gave his last public service 
as chancéellor, the college which trained in law and politics Thomas Jef- 
ferson, Governor Randolph, Chief Justice Marshall, and nearly all of the 
Virginia statesmen of the revolutionary and formative periods in our 
Federal history, has not now a single student. Its classic halls are closed 
and deserted. From a once flourishing faculty, which early and ably 
represented both history and political science with other liberal arts, 
only the president, who is also professor of mathematics and physics, 
now remains, At the opening of every academic year, in October, 
iv

  8 LETTER. 
Doctor Ewell causes the chapel bell to be rung, reminding Williamsburg 
that the ancient college still lives. To friends of the higher education 
in all of our States this fact will echo as a note of warning against public 
neglect and legislative indifference toward higher institutions of learning. 
The present monograph has been prepared by Dr. Herbert B. Adams, 
the head of the Department of History and Political Science at the 
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, in connection with his more 
extended inquiry for the Bureau of Education respecting the study 
of history in American colleges and universities. 
This special inquiry is, however, not designed to be a special plea 
for the College of William and Mary, whose claim for reimbursement for 
damages suffered at the hands of undisciplined and straggling soldiers 
has more than once been presented to Congress, and more than once 
favorably reported by the Committee on Education and Labor, sus- 
tained by the opinions of lawyers and Federal officers. The primary 
objects of the present investigation have been to discover the historical 
beginnings of the higher education at the South; to trace the causes of 
the early prosperity of William and Mary College; to show its influence 
upon Virginia statesmen and the Southern States, its relation to the 
university ideas of Jefferson and Washington, and its significance to 
the whole country; to point out the causes of the decline of William 
and Mary College; to explain the rise of the University of Virginia, 
and the necessity of popular support for the higher education. 
The most practical of all results from this historical study of William 
and Mary College is the suggestion of a possible revival in the city of 
Washington and throughout the country of the original Virginia idea 
of political education, which made Williamsburg a school of states- 
men who were fitted in the college-capital to prepare the so-called 
“Virginia plan,” from which our present Constitution grew. It is the 
idea of intimate organic connection between Education and Govern- 
ment in a municipal environment. 
The promotion of political education by connection on the one hand 
with the people, and on the other with the administration of State and 
Nation, is an idea worthy of consideration in this centennial year of our 
Constitution, which was founded upon political wisdom and Federal 
democracy. In December, 1886, it was proposed, at a meeting in Phil- 
adelphia of delegates from the various States and Territories in the 
Union, to create a suitable memorial commemorative of the Consti- 
tution. Doctor Adams suggests a civil academy in the City of Wash- 
ington for the practical training of representative college graduates 
appointed to government fellowships for two years from Congressional 
districts. He would combine, at the national capital, the West Point 
idea and the Williamsburg idea for the highest political education, 
and apply the results to the general improvement of civic life through- 
out the country. This eminent scholar writes with the freedom of one

who understands as well as loves his subject, and his article will com- 
mend itself to the hearty approval of all interested in American learn- 
ing, in the history of our country, and in the faithful record of the first 
steps in American education. 
In view of these facts I recommend the publication of the Denes as 
a Circular of Information. I have the honor to be, 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Commissioner.

  THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. 
FIRST ENDOWMENT OF AN AMERICAN COLLEGE. 
In 1619—one year before the Pilgrim Fathers came to the land named 
New England by Captain John Smith—Sir Edwin Sandys, president of 
the Virginia Company in old England, moved the grant of ten thousand 
acresof land for the establishment of a university at Henrico. The pro- 
posed grant, which was duly made, included one thousand acres for an 
Indian college; the remainder was to be “the foundation of a seminary 
of learning for the English.” The very same year the bishops of Eng- 
land, at the suggestion of the King, raised the sum of fifteen hundred 
pounds for the encouragement of Indian education. Thus, by the com- 
bined anthority of church and state, was anticipated by more than two 
centuries the endowment of such institutions as are now represented by 
the Hampton School and by the University of Virginia. 
It was not from lack of generosity or good-will toward the cause of 
higher education and the improvement of the Indians, that these, the 
earliest of all American endowments, bore no immediate fruit beyond 
the subscription of one hundred and fifty pounds in 1621, for a prepar- 
atory or collegiate school at Charles City, and the appropriation of one 
thousand acres of land, with five servants and an overseer to improve 
the same. The Virginia Company was thoroughly in earnest with re- 
gard to its educational project. Tenants were sent over to occupy the 
university lands, and Mr. George Thorpe, a gentleman of His Majesty’s 
Privy Chamber, came over to be the superintendent of the university 
itself. This first beginning of philanthropy toward the Indians and of 
educational foundations for the English in America was suspended by 
reason of the Indian massacre, in the spring of 1622, when Mr. Thorpe 
and three hundred and forty settlers, including tenants of the univer- 
sity, were cut off by an insurrection of savages. 
ACADEMIA VIRGINIENSIS ET OXONIENSIS. 
It was only two years after this terrible catastrophe that the idea of 
a university in Virginia was revived. Experience with treacherous In- 
dians suggested that the institution should be erected upon a secluded, 
sheltered site—an island in the Susquehanna River. The curious trav-

eller, glancing at that charming river view to the northwest as he crosses 
to Havre de Grace on the Pennsylvania Railroad, may see this island- 
retreat in the foreground, serving now to support the piers of the Bal- 
timore and Ohio bridge. The island was actually granted in 1624 for 
the “Foundinge and maintenance of a university, and such schools in 
Virginia as shall there be erected, and shall be called Academia Vir- 
giniensis et Oxoniensis.”’ Such a refuge for learning in Virginia reminds 
the student of that river-encircled monastery, called Lindisfarne, among 
the savage Northumbrians. If one should continue his journey to 
Charlottesville, and to the present University of Virginia, he would be 
again reminded of the old monastic system of seclusion and protection 
from the dangers of the world. It was, perhaps, a pleasant irony of 
fate which led the free-thinking Jefferson to imitate the ground-plan of 
the monastic schools of Europe, when he laid the foundations of real 
university education in Virginia and America. 
The project for a university called Academia Virginiensis et Oxoni- 
ensis, upon that island refuge in the Susquehanna River, failed like the 
original project for a university at Henrico. The plan was broken off 
by the death of its chief advocate and promoter, Mr. Edward Palmer. 
But the idea of a university for Virginia was not lost; it slumbered on 
during the next generation, which was too busy repairing its material 
losses, and in strengthening its colonial position, to think of the higher 
education. 
THE VIRGINIANS VOTE FOR THE HIGHER EDUCATION. 
In 1660, the colonial Assembly of Virginia took into their own hands 
the project of founding educational institutions within their borders. 
The motive of the Virginians was precisely the same as that of the great 
and general Court of Massachusetts, when it established Harvard Co® 
lege, and grammar schools to fit youth “for ye university.” The Vir- 
ginians voted “that for the advance of learning, education of youth, 
supply of the ministry, and promotion of piety, there be land taken 
upon purchases for a Colledge and free schoole, and that there be, with 
as much speede as may be convenient, houseing erected thereon for 
entertainment of students and schollers.”? It was also voted in 1660 that 
the various commissioners of county courts take subscriptions on court 
days for the benefit of the college, and that the commissioners send 
orders throughout their respective counties to the vestrymen of all the 
parishes for the purpose of raising money from such inhabitantsas “have 
not already subscribed.” 
  
‘This novel point in the educational history of Virginia was first suggested to 
the writer by President D. C. Gilman’s Phi Beta Kappa oration at Cambridge, Mass., 
July 1, 1886. The original authority 1 upon the point is Neill’s Virginia Vetusta, 183. 
The aneiion of the Phi Beta Kappa Society of Harvard University recalls the fact 
that the parent chapter of this distinguished body was organized in Williamsburg, 
Va., at William and Mary College, December 5, 1776.

e
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. 13 
It appears from the record of this legislation in Hening’s Statutes of _ 
Virginia that. already, in 1660, ‘His Majestie’s Governour, Council of 
State, and Burgesses of the present grand Assembly have severally sub- 
scribed severall considerable sumes of money and quantityes of to- 
bacco,” to be paid upon demand after a place had been provided and 
built upon for educational purposes.! <A petition was also recommended 
to Sir William Berkeley, then governor of Virginia, that the King be 
petitioned for letters patent authorizing collections from ‘“ well-dis- 
posed people in England for the erecting of colledges and schooles in 
this countrye.”? This action of the Virginians in 1660 ought to be taken 
as much better evidence of an early regard for education in that col- 
ony:than the well-known saying of Governor Berkeley would seem to 
indicate. In reply to an inquiry by the lords commissioners of trades 
and plantations respecting the progress of learning in the colony of 
Virginia, Berkeley said, “‘I thank God there are no free schools nor 
printing, and I hope we shall not have these hundred years.” > 
A WORD IN BERKELEY’S DEFENCE. 
This answer by a crusty old governor has been quoted perhaps too 
often as an index of the real sentiments of colonial Virginia toward 
the cause of education. Not only is the tone of popular legislation 
entirely opposed to the current view, but Berkeley’s own acts should 
modify our judgment of his words. He actually subscribed, with other 
gentlemen of the colony, for “a Golledge of students of the liberal arts 
and sciences.” Undoubtedly Sir William did not believe in popular 
education as it is now understood. If he had done so, he would have 
been much in advance of his time. He believed in the higher education 
and in home training. Regarding elementary instruction, he said that 
Virginia pursued “the same course that is taken in England out of 
towns, every man, according to his ability, instructing his children. 
We have forty-eight parishes, and our ministry are well paid, and by 
consent, should be better if they would pray oftener and preach less.” 
Here is an excellent type of John Bull. This growling, grumbling 
country squire would have been the first to subscribe for an increase in 
the parsou’s salary or for a ‘free school” in his own parish. 
The times were not yet ripe for classical education in Virginia, for 
that was what the term “free school” meant in the seventeenth century. 
It was free in the sense of teaching the liberal arts, preparatory to 
college training. In old England, and in her colonies, free schools*

were originally synonymous with Latin schools or grammar schools. 
It would be as absurd to identify the ancient and the modern meanings 
of free schools as to confuse a modern grammar school with the earlier 
or classical use of that term. When Sir William thanked God that 
there were no free schools in Virginia, we should not take the profane 
remark too seriously, for he had subscribed for the cause of classical 
education ten years before. 
WHY FREE SCHOOLS AND THE COLLEGE WERE DELAYED. 
It is not strange that little or nothing was really accomplished at this 
time for the cause of higher education in Virginia beyond the taking 
of subscriptions throughout the counties and parishes. Virginia was a 
new country, extraordinarily attractive from an agricultural point of 
view. Her settlers, instead of gathering in towns and villages, as the 
settlers of New England were by law required to do, dispersed more 
and more, imitating the English model of rural society already estab- 
lished by representative Virginians. It might well be expected that it 
would take a much longer time to develop an educational system in 
colonial Virginia than in Massachusetts or Connecticut, which were 
both made up of compact village republics. It took the University of 
Michigan nearly fifty years to get fairly under way, even with the aid 
of a national land grant, good territorial legislation, and the progressive 
spirit of the great West and of the nineteenth century. The Virgin- 
ians were well enough disposed toward schools and colleges, but cir- 
cumstances, such as physical geography and political economy, were 
against them. In rural districts subscriptions are always taken leis- 
urely and collections even moreso Virginia was no exception to the 
rule.1 Some writers would have us believe that the college was actu- 
ally planted as early as 1661, but this is highly improbable. Early 
educational enactments in Virginia were like many of those early 
towns—on paper only. And yet the Virginians really meant to have 
both towns and a college. In 1688~89, twenty-five hundred pounds 
were subscribed by a few wealthy gentlemen in the colony and by their 
merchant friends in England toward the endowment of the higher edu- 
cation. 
ROYAL ENDOWMENT BY WILLIAM AND MARY. 
In 1691 the colonial Assembly sent the Rey. James Blair, the com- 
. missary or representative of the Bishop of London, back to England to 
secure a charter for the proposed college. Virginia’s agent went 
straight to Queen Mary and explained the educational ambition of her 
colony in America. The Queen favored the idea of a college, and William   
1See “‘A bill for facilitating ye payment of ye Donations to the College of William 
and Mary in Virginia,” 1698, Calendar of Virginia State Papers, i, 61. Beverly, whose 
History of Virginia was first published in 1705, says: ‘‘ The subscribed money did not 
come in with the same readiness with which it had been underwritten.”
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. 15 
wisely concurred. The royal pair agreed to allow two thousand pounds 
out of the quit-rents of Virginia toward building the college. Mr. Blair 
then went to Seymour, the attorney-general, with the royal command 
toissueacharter. Seymour demurred. The country was then engaged 
in war, and could ill afford to plant a college in Virginia. But Mr. Blair 
urged that the institution was to prepare young men to become ministers 
of the Gospel. Virginians, he said, had souls to be saved as well as 
their English countrymen. “Souls!” said Seymour, ‘Damn your souls! 
Make tobacco!” 
John Bull is often brutally frank in the expression of his colonial 
policy, but quite as often, while swearing and grumbling, he opens his 
purse. The English Government concluded to give not only £2,000 in 
money, but also 20,000 acres of land, with a tax of one penny on every 
pound of tobacco exported from Maryland and Virginia, together with 
all fees and profits arising from the office of surveyor-general, which 
were to be controlled by the president and faculty of the college. They 
were authorized to appoint special surveyors for the counties whenever 
the governor and his council thought it necessary. These privileges, 
granted by charter in 1693, were of great significance in the economic 
history of Virginia. They brought the entire land system of the colony 
into the hands of a collegiate land office. Even after the Revolution, 
one-sixth of the fees to all public surveyors continued to be paid into 
the college treasury down to the year 1819, when this custom was abol- 
ished.2 In no way could the College of William and Mary have better 
grasped the political economy of Virginia than by taxing its tobacco 
and surveying its land. This union of the college with the practical in- 
terests of the colony developed the wisest statesman this country has 
ever seen—George Washington, who received his first public commis- 
sion as county surveyor at the hands of the president of William and 
Mary. 
COLONIAL ENDOWMENT. 
Specific acts by the Virginia House of Burgesses strengthened the 
royal endowment of William and Mary. In 1693 an export duty on all 
skins and furs was permanently levied for the support of the college.* 
In 1718 one thousand pounds were appropriated by the Virginia House 
of Burgesses for the education of ‘ingenious scholars, natives of this 
colony.”* The special right of Maryland youth to be educated at Will- 
iam and Mary was early recognized.» This was probably due to the 
fact that Maryland, like Virginia, was taxed one penny a pound on all 
exported tobacco, for the purpose of affording a permanent revenue to 
the college. In 1734 a tax was imposed upon all imported liquors “for

the better support of the college—so as some part thereof shall be laid 
out and applied for buying such books for the use of the scholars and 
students in the college—and such books, so to be bought, shall be marked 
thus: The gift of the General Assembly of Virginia, in the year 1734.1 
This is perhaps one of the best dispositions of a liquor tax on record. 
In 1759 the college received the proceeds of a tax imposed on peddlers. 
Altogether the annual revenues of William and Mary before the out- 
break of the American Revolution were estimated at about £2,300. 
SCHOLARSHIPS. 
Various scholarships, or “foundations,” yielding pecuniary support 
to students at William and Mary, were early established. The House 
of Burgesses founded three; Colonel Hill, of Shirley, and Robert Car- 
ter (King Carter), of Corotoman, together gave the sum of two hundred 
pounds for the endowment ofa scholarship ; Mrs. Thomas Bray, of New 
Kent, gave two hundred pounds; Mrs. Elizabeth Harrison, of Surrey, 
three hundred pounds; the Rev. James Blair, of Williamsburg, five 
hundred pounds; and Philip Lightfoot, of Sandy Point, the same sum. 
These scholarships were all founded before the American Revolution.” 
BOYLE’S ENDOWMENT OF INDIAN EDUCATION. 
The Hon. Robert Boyle, who died in England in 1691, by will enjoined 
his executors “‘ to apply his personal estate to such charitable and pious 
uses as they, in their discretion, should think fit.” It was finally 
agreed, in 1697, that the revenue of the Boyle bequest, which had been 
invested in a landed estate called the “ Brasserton,” should be annually 
paid over to the College of William and Mary, subject to an annual draft 
of ninety pounds, payable by the Virginia college to Harvard College. 
The intention of this endowment was the encouragement of Indian edu- 
cation and the propagation of the gospel among the natives. By means 
of the Boyle fund the College of William and Mary erected a building 
called the “ Brasserton” upon the college green, and it long served as 
an Indian school. 
An earnest attempt was made in Virginia to educate Indian boys. 
At one time, during Governor Spotswood’s régime, there were nearly 
twenty Indian students at William and Mary College. The governor 
remitted the tribute of peltry formerly exacted from certain tribes, on 
condition that they should send the children of the “chief men” to 
Williamsburg to be educated. Juvenile hostages were also taken from 
hostile tribes for the same purpose, which served also to promote the 
salus publica. In a letter to the Bishop of London, dated July 26, 1712, 
Spotswood speaks of the success of the experiment, but of the inad- 
equacy of the Boyle endowment. The Indians, he says, ‘‘ have a Master 
to teach them and are decently cloathed and maintained, so that they

seem very well pleased with the change of their condition, as indeed 
their parents and others of their Nations who come frequently to see 
them express much satisfaction with the care that is taken of them, and 
frequently lament their own misfortune in not having the like advan- 
tages in their Youth; but as the revenue of the College settled by Mr. 
Boyle for that service is insufficient to support so great a charge, I hope , 
your Lord’p will use your interest for obtaining some contributions 
from the Society for propagating the Gospell, and from other charitable 
persons to help the College to promote so good a design.”! 
MOTIVES FOR FOUNDING THE COLLEGE. 
The charter of the College of William and Mary shows that the ob- 
jects of the foundation were much the same as those originally pro- 
posed in 1619, and again in 1660. The General Assembly of Virginia had 
asked for aroyal endowmeit of the college, ‘‘to the end that the Church of 
Virginia may be furnished with a seminary of ministers of the gospel, 
and that the youth may be piously educated in good letters and manners, 
‘and that the Christian faith may be propagated amongst the Western 
Indians, to the glory of Almighty God.”? This pious language would 
serve equally well in New England or Virginia to describe the bighest 
motives of the founders of educational institutions. It is useless to ar-’ 
rogate any peculiar or particular piety in the educational establish- 
ments of any part of this country. The truth is that in old England, 
through many centuries, good men, ecclesiastics and laymen, sover- 
eigns and subjects, had been laying educational foundations, such as 
monasteries, colleges, and free town schools, upon which ideas the 
New World has built. The motives ofthe English, whether in Virginia 
or New England, in providing for the pious education of their sons in 
good letters and good manners, were but colonial outcroppings of the 
same public spirit which founded the various colleges which now make 
up the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The propagation of the 
Christian faith among the Indians was perhaps a secondary considera- 
tion, but it was honestly attempted in Virginia as well as -in Massa- 
chusetts. 
Englishmen are much the same the world over, whether in America 
or Australia. They are a healthy union of public spirit and private 
interest, of measured philanthropy and enlightened selfishness. An

where at one time (1716) seventy Indian children were taught. 
2An “Alt Heidelberg” friend of the writer, Dr. George Gary Bush, in his interest- 
ing and attractive history of Harvard, the First American University, published in 
1886 by Cupples, Upham & Co., says, p. 64, of thatinstitution, ‘‘ The educationof both 
‘the English and the Indian youth in knowledge and godliness’ was, according to the

Englishman’s struggle for the salvation of his own soul often ends in 
organized effort for the good of his community or of his country, and 
sometimes it takes the direction of foreign missions, in lands which he 
is striving to subdue. It is this curious blending of individual with 
social forces which has converted England and her colonies into vigor- 
ous powers for civilization. 
ORGANIZATION AND GOVERNMENT. 
The power to establish and to organize ‘a certain place of universal 
study, or perpetual college, for Divinity, Philosophy, Languages, and 
other good Arts and Sciences, consisting of one President, six masters 
or professors, and’ an hundred scholars, more or less, graduates and 
non-graduates,” was intrusted by the charter, issued February 19, 1693, 
to a self-perpetuating board of eighteen trustees, resident in the colony. 
They were to have the appointing power, and were to form the board 
of governors or visitors. Every year they were to elect from their own 
number a rector for the college. Every seven years they were to choose 
some eminent and discreet person to be the chancellor. Naturally the 
Rev. James Blair was by the charter made one of the original trustees, 
also the first annual rector and president of the college for life. He was 
* a vigorous, aggressive Scotchman, and held his presidential office for 
fifty years, dying in 1743. The charter appointed the Bishop of Lon- 
don to be the first chancellor. The trustees continued, down to the time 
of the American Revolution, to associate the academic with the ecclesi- 
astical office. Inasmuch as the first president, the Rev. Dr. Blair, was 
the Bishop’s commissary, or deputy, in Virginia, it was but natural that 
these two offices should remain united down to the time of the Revolu- 
tion. Thus the presidency! of the college and the primacy of the church 
in Virginia were represented by one and the same man. The charter

provided that the president and professors of the college should con- 
stitute a body corporate, and that to it ultimately the trustees 
should transfer their entire endowment as soon as the institution should 
be fairly established. This was actually done; so that, in after time, 
the trustees remained simply as the board of annual visitors, with gen- 
eral superintendence and the appointing power. 
THE FACULTY OF INSTRUCTION. 
The charter provided for a college president and for six masters or 
professors. The text of the act transferring the college from the trust- 
ees to the faculty shows that the latter consisted, in 1729, of President 
Blair, two professors in the school of theology, namely, Bartholomew 
Yates and Franci§ Fontaine,‘ and two in'the school of philosophy to 
wit, Alexander Irwin, and William Dawson “late of Queen College, in 
Oxford.” Three of these professors were so-called “clerks,” who had 
been officiating in the parish churches of Virginia. Joshua Fry, a gentle- 
man of Williamsburg, was appointed master of the grammar school, 
which was early established ‘for the immediate education of the youth of 
the colony in the Latin and Greek tongues.” Thus were laid anew in 
America the old classical foundations of a liberal education. The gram- 
mar or Latin school was the corner-stone of the college proper, which 
was a philosophical department. The institution of a school of theol- 
ogy reminds us that the foundation laid by William and Mary needed 
only a school of law and a school of medicine to have become at the 
very outset a complete university, which, historically speaking, com- 
prises four faculties. 
“Tn addition,” says Campbell, ‘to the five professorships of Greek 
and Latin, the mathematics, moral philosophy, and two of divinity, pro- 
vided for by the charter, a sixth, called the Brasserton, from the estate 
in England which secured the endowment, had been annexed by the 
celebrated Robert Boyle, for the instruction and conversion of the In- 
dians.”? 
Mr. R. A. Brock, corresponding secretary of the Virginia Historical 
Society, in his notes to the Dinwiddie Papers,’ says: “The succes- 
sion of the masters or professors at this early seat of learning would 
be a highly interesting addition to the annals of American education. 
Through the repeated destruction of the college buildings and records 
by fire no such complete list is known to be extant. * * * The 
following. list of the faculty to 1752, inclusive, has been preserved: 
Rev. Francis Fontaine (born 1697, died 1749), professor of Oriental 
languages, 1729; Rey. Bartholomew Yates, professor of divinity, 1729; 
Joshua Fry, 1729, master of the grammar schools (afterward advanced 
to the chair of mathematics); Rev. William Stith, 1731; Edward Ford, 
1738; John Graeme, 1741; Rev. Thomas Dawson, 1738; William Pres-

The writer has no means of determining the sacibtta nature of the early 
courses of instruction provided by thé College of William and Mary. 
In all probability they were much the same as those given during the 
scholastic régime of early Harvard, which the writer has elsewhere de- 
scribed.!. The Harvard system was but a colonial reproduction of the 
higher education of England as fostered at Oxford and Cambridge dur- 
ing the seventeenth century. The professors of philosophy at the Col- 
lege of William and Mary probably taught logic, rhetoric, ethics, physics, 
and politics, together with arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy ; possi- 
bly also the Westminster catechism and alittle history, sacred and pro- 
fane. Historia civilis and Historia naturalis certainly belonged to the 
old scholastic curriculum. The study of American history was culti- 
vated in an intelligent and original way by the Rev. Dr. William Stith, 
the historian of Virginia, professor in the college in 1731, and who was 
commissary of the Bishop of London and president of the college from 
1752 to 1755. His work was first published at Williamsburg in 1747, 
where the historian prosecuted his researches in government offices re- 
specting the beginnings of Virginia. He was the second academic rep- 
resentative of Virginia history. Prof. Hugh Jones, of whom we shall 
presently speak, was the first. : 
In 1734, the president, masters, scholars, and students of the College 
of William and Mary, and all the domestic servants belonging to the 
institution, were forever exempted from taxation, not only from tithes, 
but from all public, county, and parish levies.?, This immunity is an in- 
teresting survival of the monastic system of the Old Worid. 
The continuity of monastic tradition is further seen in the law for- 
bidding professors to marry. In 1769, when a reverend professor of 
theology and the reverend master of the grammar school took to them- 
selves wives and settled in the city of Williamsburg, it was resolved 
by the board of visitors: “‘That it is the opinion of this visitation that 
the professors and masters, their engaging in marriage and the concerns 
of a private family, and shifting. their residence to any place without 
the college, is contrary to the principles on which the college was founded 
and their duty as professors.” 
The salary of President Blair was originally fixed at £150 a year, but 
it was afterward cut down to £100. The salary of the masters, or fel- 
lows, as we learn from the statements of one of the earliest of them, 
was £80 per annum, with 20 shillings for an entrance fee and 20 shil- 
lings for tuition from each student intrusted to their charge.

THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. 21 
PROFESSOR HUGH ‘JONES. 
Probably one of the very best types of the early professor in the Col- 
lege of William and Mary is the Rev. Hugh Jones, already mentioned. 
He was an Englishman of university training, who came first to Mary- 
Jand in 1696, and became the incumbent of Christ Church parish, in 
Calvert County. He sent home an account of the province of Maryland, 
which was published in the Transactions of the Royal Society. Upon 
the recommendation of the Bishop of London he was appointed to the 
chair of mathematics in the college at Williamsburg. While resident 
there he served as chaplain of the General Assembly, and as “lecturer” 
in the Bruton parish church; he preached also in Jamestown, the Can- 
terbury of Virginia. He left the province for England in 1722, and in 
1724 brought out in London his book on “The Present State of Vir- 
ginia,” which includes sketches of Maryland and-North Carolina. Thus, 
through the faithful work of one scholarly churchman and college pro- 
fessor, the characteristics of three southern colonies passed into his- 
torical science. If this man did not teach history, he made it and wrote it. 
His monograph is acknowledged to be one of the best sources of infor- 
mation respecting Virginia in the early part of the eighteenth century. 
Professor Jones was not altogether satisfied with the existing system 
of education at the College of William and Mary. In his book he sug- 
gests certain modifications, which are very remarkable for this early 
period. He proposed that one of the six professorships be devoted to 
the subject of history; but what is more surprising, he actually proposed 
that the college should be recognized as the training school for the civil 
service of the colony. The following are the professor’s own words: 
“The Charter mentions six masters or professors, but does not specify 
the professions; it directs to the making of statutes and founding scholar- 
ships, but the particulars are left to the discretion of the managers; and 
some such establishment as this here mentioned may not be improper, 
especially if for greater encouragement the surveyors of each county were to 
be appointed by the president and masters, out of such as have taken a Bach- 
ellor of Arts degree there; and if the Governor and Council were to elect a 
certain number of Bachellors for clerks into the Secretaries office; out of 
which clerks attending and writing there at certain times, the county clerks 
should be appointed. 
“The office of the president would be to govern the College, be treas- 
urer and censor, and have a casting vote in all debates. The six pro- 
fessors would be: One for Divinity, who should be chaplain and cate- 
chist; one for Mathematicks, one for Philosophy, one for Languages, one 
for History, one for Humanity, who should be Grammar Master.” 
This was the educational ideal of one of the best professors in the 
College of William and Mary at a very early-period of its history. The 
scheme is remarkably well-rounded for those times. An earlier recom- 
mendation for a distinct chair of history and for a school of administra- 
tion, it would be difficult to find in this country.

  22 CIRCULARS OF INFORMATION FOR 1887. 
Returning to America after long absence in England, the Rev. Hugh 
Jones resumed parochial work in Virginia, but he finally returned to 
Maryland, where he built up various parishes, notably William and 
Mary parish and Sassafras parish, in Cecil County. He persuaded the 
people to build brick churches instead of cheap wooden structures, and 
he invigorated society wherever he went. He continued pastoral work 
until he was ninety years old, when he retired, ‘‘ having worthily won 
the title of venerable.” This professor and ecclesiastic might be called 
the Venerable Bede of Maryland and Virginia. He died in 1760, at the 
age of ninety-one, having been in the ministry sixty-five years.' 
ORIGIN OF WILLIAMSBURG. 
‘The College of William and Mary, like Harvard College, was a state 
institution. It was founded by what was then the National Govern- 
ment, by royal endowment. The charter gave the General Assembly of 
Virginia the right to determine the best site for the college. It was 
voted to erect the buildings ‘“‘as neere the church now standing in 
Middle Plantation old fields as convenience will permitt.” Thus in Vir- 
ginia, as in Europe, the church was the original centre around which 
educational institutions were planted. There was no town in ‘“ Middle 
Plantation old fields” at the time the college was built. Simply a 
church in Bruton Parish? and a scattered settlement, with an archaic 
system of common lands; these were the beginnings of what was yet to 
become a college town and the capital of Virginia. 
It is a most interesting and remarkable fact that the founding of the 
College of William and Mary at Middle Plantation determined the polit- 
ical centre of Virginia and the founding of Williamsburg. The sup- 
posed healthfulness of the locality had indeed great weight with the 
Assembly in fixing upon Middle Plantation as a site for both college 
and capital, for the place “hath been found, by constant experience, 
to be healthy and agreeable to the constitutions of the inhabitants”;% 
but in the preamble to the act passed in the fourth year of the reign of 
Queen Anne, 1705, when Williamsburg was founded, this additional 
motive seems to have decided the location of the city: “It will prove 
highly advantageous and beneficial to his Majesty’s Royal College of 
William and Mary to have the conveniences of a Town near the same.”*   
1Information concerning this remarkable man was obtained from Spotswood’s Let- 
ters, i, 103; ii, 253; and from Bishop Perry’s monumental work on the History of the 
American Episcopal Church, i, 307. 
2 The Vestry-book of Bruton Parish dates from 1674; but Bishop Meade (i, 146) says 
that there was a church at Middle Plantation as early as 1665. 
3Hening, iii, 419. With regard to the removal of the seat of government from 
Jamestown to Williamsburg, Hugh Jones says, in his Present State of Virginia (1724): 
«When the State House and Prison were burned down, Governor Nicholson removed 
the residence of the Governor with the meeting of General Courts and General Assem- 
‘blies to Middle Plantation, seven miles from James Town, in a healthier and more con- 
venient Place, and freer from the Annoyance of muskettoes”!—Sabin’s reprint, p. 25.

‘THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. 23 
Clearly these early legislators of Virginia were in advance of their 
age. They believed what the nineteenth century is just beginning to 
find out—that a good municipal environment is favorable rather than 
injurious to the higher education; that the town is more suitable than 
the country for the growth of a college or a university. The early Vir- 
ginians had no idea that professors and students should be turned out 
to pasture like superannuated horses and untraiued colts, and expected. 
to feed on grass like Nebuchadnezzar. It is'a very bucolic view of the 
higher education to expect it to flourish in the open fields, apart from 
human society, away from great libraries, museums, schools, churches, 
and from all the helpful, quickening influences of municipal life. Civ- 
ilization and culture are, historically speaking, the products of towns 
and cities. The idea of isolating students from the world is but the 
survival of the monasticsystem, which sought cloistered retreats within 
protecting walls. While society and education owe much to this sys- 
tem, it should be remembered that monasticism is a medieval and not 
a modern idea. Indeed the monastery ani the castle were but historic 
reversions to the more primitive idea of hill-forts and patriarchal burghs, 
from which ancient cities and classical civilization sprang. 
PLAN OF WILLIAMSBURG.

and for the courts. The building when completed was to be “ called 
and known by the name of the Capitol,”! and it was resolved that “the 
space of two hundred feet of ground every way from the said Capitol 
shall not be built upon, planted, or occupied forever.” Truly a noble 
reservation, worthy to become the forum of Virginia! Surviving types 
of the same idea may be seen in Capitol Square at Richmond, and in 
every court green around the court houses of the South and in every 
town common of New England. The main street of Williamsburg was 
called the Duke of Gloucester Street. It was the Pennsylvania Avenue 
of the period. It extended from the capitol to the utmost western lim- 
its of the city, where it “joins on ye Land belonging to ye Colledge.” 
This colonial boulevard, connecting the seat of government with the 
seat of learning, shows that politics and the higher education were in- 
terests closely associated in the minds and hearts of the Virginians, as 
indeed are Richmond and the University of Virginia to this day. 
Of the appearance of the Duke of Gloucester Street in 1724, a brief 
description is given by Professor Hugh Jones: “Fronting the college 
at near its whole breadth is extended a noble street, mathematically 
straight (for the first design of the town’s form is changed to a much 
better),? just three-quarters of a mile in length, at the other end of 
which stands the Capitol, a noble, beautiful, and commodious pile as 
any of its kind, built at the cost of the late Queen, and the direction 
of the Governor. eB 
APPEARANCE OF THE COLLEGE. 
The original college building was burned down in 1705, but it was 
immediately restored in the same style, if we may trust tradition. A 
good description of the appearance of the college in 1724 has come down 
to us through that original tract on The Present State of Virginia. 
Professor Jones said of the college: 
“The front, which looks due east, is double, and is 136 feet long. It 
is a lofty pile of brick building, adorned with a cupola. ‘At the north 
end runs back a large wing, which is a handsome hall, answerable to 
which the chapel is to be built; and there is a spacious piazza on the 
west side, from one wing to the other. It is approached by a good 
walk, and a grand entrance by steps, with good courts and gardens 
about it, with a good house and apartment for the Indian master and 
his scholars, and out-houses; and a large pasture inclosed like a park, 
with about 150 acres of land adjoining for occasional uses. The build- 
ing is beautiful and commodious, being first modelled by Sir Christo- 
pher Wren, adapted to the nature of the country by the gentlemen 
there; and since it was burned down it has been rebuilt, and nicely

contrived, altered and adorned by the ingenious direction of Governor 
Spotswood, and is not altogether unlike Chelsea Hospital.” 
Professor Jones was evidently familiar with the sights and scenes of 
old England@, as wellas with the best society of the period. Like Chau- 
cer, he had seen the world as in his time. The parson-professor was 
in favor at court, as appears from a letter of Governor Spotswood! 
to the Bishop of London in 1717. The man was an excellent observer 
of social Williamsburg. He says, in one naive passage: “At the Cap- 
itol, at publick times, may be seen a great number of handsome, well- 
dress’d, compleat Gentlemen. And at the Governor’s House upon 
Birth-Nights and at Balls and Assemblies, I have seen as fine an ap- 
pearance, as good diversion, and as splendid entertainments in Gov- 
ernor Spotswood’s time, as I have seen any where else.” 
A PICTURE OF THE TOWN AND CAPITOL. 
A complete picture of the town, as it was in 1724, is given by this 
observing professor, to whom Virginia owes a great historical debt, for 
he describes the whole colony as faithfully as he did its college-capital. 
He describes the public buildings, and all the public offices, courts, 
ete. “Ineach wing of the Capitol,” he says, ‘‘is a good stair case, one 
leading to the Council Chamber, where the Governor and Council sit in 
very great state, in imitation of the King and Council, or the Lord 
Chancellor and House of Lords. Over the portico is a large room where 
conferences ate held, and prayers are read by the Chaplain to the Gen- 
eral Assembly ; which office I have had the honour for some years to per- 
' form.” He describes the parish church, a brick structure in the form of 
across, “regular and convenient, and adorned as the best Churches in 
London. This from the Parish is called Bruton Church, where I had the 
favour of being lecturer.” 
Clearly this professor was a useful man in the community. Not far 
from the church there was the market place, “near which is a Play- 
House and good Bowling Green.” From the church northward was 
Palace Street, at the end of which stood the Governor’s house, “finished 
and beautified with gates, fine gardens, offices, walks, a fine canal, 
orchards, ete.” The house had a cupola, “ or Lanthorn,” which was illumi- 
nated on festival nights, together with most of the town. ‘These build- 
ings here described,” he says, ‘are justly reputed the best in all the 
English America, and are exceeded by few of their kind in England.” 
He mentions “a pleasant, long dry walk, broad, and almost level from 
the College to the Capitol.” 
“ Williamsburg,” he says, “is a market town, and is governed by a 
mayor and aldermen.” It is a town “ well stock’d with rich stores, of all 
sorts of goods, and well furnished with the best provisions and liquors. 
Here dwell several very good families, and more reside here in their own 
houses at publick times. They live in the same neat manner, dress after

the same modes, and behave themselves exactly as the Gentry in Lon- 
don; most families of any note having a coach, chariot, Berlin, or chaise. 
The town is laid out regularly iu lots or square portions, sufficient each 
for a house and garden. Thus they dwell comfortably, genteelly, 
pleasantly, and plentifully in this delightful, healthful, and (I hope) 
thriving city of Williamsburgh.” 
TOWN AND COLLEGE. 
The College of William and Mary and the town of Williamsburg 
grew and flourished together, the one aiding the other in a thousand 
ways. The college appreciated what the General Assembly called 
“the conveniences of a town,” and the whole colony quickly learned 
to value educational privileges for its ambitious sons. “At the first 
Commencement of the College, in 1700,” says Campbell, one of the 
historians of Virginia, “there was a great concourse of people; sev- 
eral planters came thither in coaches, and others in sloops from New 
York,, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, it being a new thing in that part 
of America to hear graduates perform their exercises. The Indians had 
the curiosity, some of them, to visit Williamsburg upon that occasion ; 
and the whole country rejoiced, as if they had some relish of learning.” ! 
A cultivated society gathered in Williamsburg, because it was the in- 
tellectual and political capital of Virginia. It became fashionable for 
the best families of the colony to spend the winter season “in town,” 
just as social England to this day centres in London during the sea- 
son. Bishop Meade, in his Old: Churches, Ministers, and Families of 
Virginia (i, 194), says: ‘ Williamsburg was once the miniature copy 
of the Court of St. James, somewhat aping the manners of that royal 
palace, while the old church and its graveyard, and the College chapel 
were, si licet cum magnis componere parva, the Westminster Abbey and 
the St. Paul’s of London, where the great ones were interred.’ More 
truly than Jamestown the new capital became the historic as well as 
the political and social centre of Virginia. From this college-capital, 
where the plays of Shakespeare first found a public hearing in America, 
went forth Virginia’s greatest sons. 
A SCHOOL OF STATESMEN. 
The gathering together of the best people of Virginia and the form- 
ing of student associations with all that was best in the history and 
polities of that colony and of Mother England were of untold influence 
in moulding the intellect, in testing the character, and in cultivating the 
manners of the rising generation. Whatever schoolmen may say, there 
is no school like the world of human society, like contact with men. 
A wise blending of scholastic and social culture makes all the differ- 
ence between the medieval monk and the modern man.

  THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. ot 
The medieval monk shunned the world and the society of his fellow 
men, but the modern man has discovered virtue in both. It is greatly 
to the honor of the founders and builders of the College of William and. 
Mary that they applied so early in the eighteenth century the idea of . 
education in a social, municipal, and political environment. Williams- 
burg was the first exponent of a noble educational policy, to which this 
country will sooner or later return. It was a policy which struggled 
into existence in Prussia in 1810, when that child of conflict, the Univer- 
sity of Berlin, was born in the capital of a kingdom that was to found 
an empire. 
Wonder is often. expressed that colonial Virginia, with her popula- 
tion widely dispersed, should have produced so many eminent public 
men, who becaine leaders in the American ‘Revolution and who after- 
ward gave such practical and sovereign direction to American polities. 
Virginia is called the mother of presidents, but the College of William 
and Mary, the alma mater of statesmen, is only another name for Vir- 
ginia. The secret of that great family of patriot-politicians lies in the 
union of home education with the higher education, in the blending of 
private with public training, after the manner of our Mother England. 
In Virginia the historic process began with English traditions of family 
culture; it developed through the personal administration of rural 
estates, through vestry meetings and county courts and the House of 
Burgesses. The evolution of a higher class of politicians, of professional 
men and cultivated gentlemen, was first accomplished at Williamsburg, 
that school of citizens, churchmen, and statesmen. There were no 
‘educated lawyers in Virginia until the college began its preparatory 
work. Bishop Meade says: ‘‘The best ministers in Virginia were those 
educated at the college and sent over to England for ordination. The 
foreigners were the great scandal of the church.” 
Religious, political, and educational forces in society always thrive 
best by association, not necessarily by union. This was true of ancient 
society, and it is no less true in the modern state. While the separa- 
tion of the school from the authority of the church and the separation 
of the church from the sphere of the state are among the greatest con- 
tributions of America to the world’s advancement, nevertheless the 
association of these great forces must be preserved in a modified form. 
Neither the state nor the church nor the school can reach its highest 
efficiency when any one of these three institutions is cut off from asso- 
ciation with the other two. A government without the support of 
religion and education, means ultimate lapse into moral and political 
anarchy. Ecclesiastical organizations, unrestrained by law and unen- 
lightened by reason, may interfere with civil liberty and check the 
progress of thought. Schools, colleges, and universities, without public 
support and legal protection, without moral and religious associations, 
are hopelessly crippled in their usefulness to society.

In colonial Virginia there was an entente cordiale between the college, ; 
the church, and the state. The clergy held their conventions! in the 
college buildings, and, before the capitol was built, the House of Bur- 
gesses used to assemble in the academic halls. The head of the college 
was the head of the church in Virginia, and there was a representative’ 
of the college in the House of Burgesses down to the Revolution. These 
facts merely illustrate the intimacy.of educational, ecclesiastical, and 
political relations in that social microcosm at Williamsburg. 
Never before or since in this country was there such a constant ob- 
ject lesson for students in the art of government and in the constitution . 
of society. The College of William and Mary, almost from its original 
planting, was a unique seminary of history and politics—of history in the 
very making, of politics in the praxis. Without identifying the two sub- 
jects, we may accept the view of Gustav Droysen, Prussia’s great histo- 
rian, who says, “What is politics to-day becomes history to-morrow.” 
The young Virginians did not study text-books of historical and politi- 
eal science. They observed the real things. The proceedings of their 
fathers at the capitol were to the sons analogous to those living pro- 
cesses of nature that are observed under the microscope in the modern 
biological laboratory. We might, however, better liken the position of 
the early Virginia students to that of the lesser clergy and inferior 
nobles, who came with the great barons of the realm to those itinerary 
Parliaments of England before the House of Commons was instituted. 
These young vassals and dependents looked on while their superiors 
took counsel with the royal Governor, the quasi king of Virginia. The 
day was to come when these budding knights and burgesses would 
themselves form a popular assembly, a new House of Commons called 
the Continental Congress, to shape the history and politics ofa nation. 
It is interesting to look over the catalogue of students at the College 
of William and Mary a few years before the outbreak of the American 
Revolution, and to notice what men this institution was training for 
service to state and country. Therein 1759 was Thomas Jefferson, son 
of Peter Jefferson of Albemarle, author of the Declaration of Independ- 
ence and of the statute of Virginia for religious freedom, and founder of 
the University of Virginia. By these three deeds he wished to be known 
to posterity. It would be glory enough for the College of William and 
Mary if she had educated him alone who is the father of American polit- 
ical thought and the first promoter of real university education. The 
roll of honor does not stop with Thomas Jefferson. There, too, appear 
Benjamin Harrison, Carter Braxton, Thomas Nelson, and George Wythe, 
all signers of the Declaration. There also are Peyton Randolph, first 
president of the Continental Congress, and John Tyler, first governor

of Maryland; James Innes, attorney-general of Virginia; James Monroe, 
President of the United States; John Blair, Judge of the Supreme 
Court of the United States; and John Marshall, the great Chief Justice. 
For seventy years previous to the Revolution, there had been an an- 
nual average of about sixty students at the College of William and 
Mary. At the outbreak of the struggle for independence there were 
seventy students. Thirty-seven of them left college and joined the 
Continental army. Three professors also took arms for their country’s 
cause. The institution, however, continued its educational work through- 
out the war until the memorable siege of Yorktown, when the college 
was temporarily closed for the accommodation of the American troops 
and their French allies. That school of churchmen, statesmen, and 
citizen-soldiers saw enacted before its doors the closing scene in one of 
the greatest dramas in modern history, when Washington and his Vir- 
ginians, the Continental Army and the French allies, drew their invest- 
ing lines around the forces of Cornwallis. 
Upon the surrender of the British forces at Yorktown, October 19, 
1781, the president and professors of William and Mary sent an address 
of congratulation to Washington. He replied on the 27th of October, 
in aletter addressed to the “ President and Professors of the University 
of William and Mary,” aecepting their felicitations and rejoicing at the 
return of peaceful security to his fellow citizens. ‘The seat of litera- 
ture at Williamsburg,” he said, “has ever in my view been an object 
of veneration. As an institution important for its communication of 
useful learning, and conducive to the diffusion of the true principles 
of rational liberty, you may be assured that it shall receive every en- 
couragement and benefaction in my power toward its re-establishment. 
The sick and wounded of the army, whom my necessities have com- 
pelled me to trouble you with, shall be removed as soon as circum- 
stances will permit—an event which will be as pleasing to me as agree- 
able to you.” 
One hundred years after the surrender of Cornwallis, representatives 
of England, France, Germany, and the United States united at York- 
town for the commemoration of that international event in which all 
these nationalities had once participated. A monument was then dedi- 
cated. Not long after this celebration the national monument to 
Washington was completed in the Federal City. Quite recently the 
old alliance between America and France has been nobly symbolized 
by the erection of a colossal statue of Liberty Enlightening the World. 
But amid all these monumental works and historical commemorations, 
there has been no thought of that old college.in the Yorktown penin- 
sula, the college which trained the statesmen of the Revolution, and 
which gave Washington his first public commission and opened the 
way to his entire career,

30 CIRCULARS OF INFORMATION FOR 1887. 
A brief review of the relation of William and Mary to George Wash- 
ington will throw new light upon this great public character, and ex- 
plain the origin of his idea of a national university. 
WASHINGTON MADE SURVEYOR BY WILLIAM AND MARY. 
\ Itis interesting to trace the evolution of men as well as of institu- 
tions. It is generally known that Washington began his public life as 
a county surveyor, but, in all probability, few persons have ever thought 
of his service in that office as the historical and economic germ of his 
political greatness. Most people regard this early work as a passing 
incident in his career and not as a determining cause. And yet itis 
possible to show that Washington’s entire public life was but the nat- 
ural outgrowth of that original appointment! given him in 1749 at 
the age of seventeen by the College of William and Mary. That ap- 
pointment, in the colonial days of Virginia, was the equivalent of a 
degree in civil engineering, and it is interesting to observe what a pe- 
culiar bias it gave to Washington’s life before and after the Revolution. 
As we have seen already, the land system of Virginia was early 
placed under the control of the college authorities, who appointed all 
county surveyors and also the surveyor-general, who represented the 
economic interests of the institution and took certain fees for its sup- 
port. From the lowest position as surveyor Washington rose to the 
very highest. It was his early practical career as ameasurer of land that 
first made him favorably known to influential Virginians. There were 
but few men really competent for the work of a surveyer in colonial 
times. Washington’s services were in great demand throughout the 
counties of Virginia. He not only surveyed private farms and planta- 
tions in settled districts, but also public lands and land grants on the 
western frontiers, among the Alleghanies, and along the upper branches 
of the Potomac. 
It was Washington’s excellent public service as a surveyor which led 
to his public commission as a militia officer in command of a military 
district for the defence of the Virginia frontiers against the encroach- 
ments of the French. It was his special knowledge of the back coun- 
try and its people, acquired as a civil engineer, that led to his diplo- 
matic commission from the seat of government in Williamsburg to the 
       
  1Jt would be interesting if one could find Wa gton’ sommission asa public 
surveyor. In lack of it, the following later form, found in the Calendar of Virginia State 
papers, vol. iii, page 246, will illustrate the probable character of the appointment: 
’ “We, the president and professors of the College of William and Mary, do certify 
his excellency, the governor, that we have examined Samuel Taylor and, having found 
him properly qualified, we do nominate him to the office of surveyor of the county of 
Cumberland.

commandant of the French posts in the Ohio Valley. From this expe- 
dition of Washington, at the age of twenty-one, when he surveyed 
French forts and French schemes with all the skill with which he had 
formerly surveyed land, proceeded the entire train of English policy 
leading to war with the French for the possession of the territory lying 
back of the Alleghanies. This frontier war established the military 
reputation of Washington, avd made him commander-in-chief of the 
Virginia forces. His frontier record in the French and Indian war was 
the stepping-stone which raised him at the outbreak of the American 
Revolution to the position of commander-in-chief of the continental 
army. 
If the Revolutionary war had never occurred, George Washington 
would have been one of the foremost men of his time. His superiority 
would have appeared in great economic enterprises for the public good, 
enterprises growing out of that original office of county surveyor which 
actually led him by a development process to take the office of sur- 
veyor general of Virginia and that of general-in chief of the armies of 
the United States. Of course that humble agrarian office, conferred 
upon a young Virginian by the College of William and Mary, did not 
make its incumbent great, but it gave an opportunity for greatness to 
develop. Washingtou’s genius was economic.! His mind grasped the 
practical questions of his time—the land question in the Ohio Valley, and 
its connection with the opening of a channel of trade between the Atlan- 
tic seaboard and the Ohio River. The conquest of that territory by the 
English, the search in that quarter for good bounty lands, the instinets 
of an explorer and of a civil engineer, made Washington appreciate more 
keenly perhaps than most of his countrymen the economic significance 
of the great West. Long before the Revolution, indeed, as early as - 
1754, he began to study the problem of connecting the tributaries of the 
upper Potomac with those of the Ohio, and of binding the East to the 
West by ties of economic interest. 2 
WASHINGTON ACQUIRES 70,000 ACRES OF LAND. 
The facts indicate that George Washington was one of the most en- 
terprising men in America. In 1763 he wrote to William Crawford, a 
Virginia officer, whom he had taught the art of surveying and who 
had served his chief as a land-looker in the back country: ‘By this time 
it may be easy for you to discover that my plan is tosecure a good deal 
of land.” Exactly how much land Washington patented in the course 
of his life it is impossible to say, but at the time of his death he owned. 
over 70,000 acres, principally in the Ohio Valley, Kentucky, the North- 
west Territory, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York along the Mohawk 
River, and in Virginia along the line of the Potomac and elsewhere.

a survey, made in 1773, of 28,400 acres on the Little Kanawha, with 
explanatory notes in Washington’s own handwriting. In the Mary- 
Jand Journal and Baltimore Advertiser for August 20, 1773, is an 
advertisement by George Washington of “ upwards of 20,000 acres of 
land on the Ohio and Great Kanawha,” which the subscriber proposed 
to divide “‘into any sized tenements that may be desired and lease upon 
moderate terms.” 
In this very advertisement there is evidence of the great thought of 
connecting the Hast and the West, the Potomac and the Ohio Rivers, for 
the ‘convenience of the settlers in transporting the produce of their 
lands to market.” Thisthought was interrupted by the outbreak of the 
national struggle for independence, but after the close of the Revolu- 
tion Washington returned to it with more energy than ever. Indeed, 
before peace had been formally declared he left his camp at Newburg 
on the Hudson and made a three weeks’ journey of exploration on horse- 
back through central New York in company with Governor Clinton, 
These two enterprising men secured together 6,600 acres of choice 
land on the Mohwak River, and talked of buying up Saratoga Springs. 
On that tour of exploration Washington saw with his own eyes the 
possibilities of that great commercial route to the West now repre- 
sented by the Brie Canal and the New York Central Railroad. Re- 
turning to Virginia he bent every energy toward the development of 
his old plan for the Potomac route. He wrote to Jefferson in 1784, “ I 
am satisfied that not a moment ought to be lost in recommencing this 
business, as I .know the Yorkers will delay no time to remove every 
obstacle in the way of the other communication, so soon as the posts of 
Oswego and Niagara are surrendered.”' The Potomac Company, of 
which George Washington becaine the chief promoter and first presi-   
1 With regard to opening the Potomac route, in 1784 Washington wrote to Jefferson 
these historical details: ‘‘More than ten years ago I was struck with the importance 
of it; and, despairing of any aid from the public, I became a principal mover of a bill 
to empower a number of subscribers to undertake at their own expense, on conditions 
which were expressed, the extension of the navigation from tide water to Wills’ 
Creek, about one hundred and fifty miles, and Ldevoutly wish that this may not be 
the only expedient by which it can be effected now. To get this business in motion, 
I was obliged even upon that ground to comprehend James River, in order to remove 
the jealousies which arose from the attempt to extend the navigation of the Poto- 
mac. The plan, however, was in a tolerably good train when I set out for Cambridge 
in 1775, and would have been in an excellent way, had it not been for the difficulties 
which were met with in the Maryland Assembly from the opposition which was given 
(according to report) by the Baltimore merchants, who were alarmed, and perhaps 
not without cause, at the consequence of water transportation to Georgetown of the 
produce which usually came to their market by land. The local interest of that 
place, joined to the short-sighted politics or contracted views of another part of that 
Assembly, gave Mr. Thomas Johnson, who was a warm promoter of the scheme on 
the north side of the Potomac, a great deal of trouble. In this situation I left mat- 
ters when I took command of the army. The war immediately called men’s attention 
to different objects, and all the money they could or would raise was applied to other 
purposes,”

dent, evolved historically into the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and the 
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. 
George Washington chose a very good specialty when he applied to 
the College of William and Mary for an elective course in land survey- 
ing. That first appointment gave direction and purpose to his entire 
life. It made him a far-seeing national economist, a man of wide-reach- 
ing enterprise and of almost boundless public spirit, which developed 
into schemes for colonizing his lands with Germans from the Palatinate, 
and for opening a route to the West which should become “ the channel 
of conveyance for the extensive and valuable trade of a rising empire.” 
These remarkable words were written to Thomas Johnson of Maryland 
as early as 1770. They show that Washington was a man of large ideas 
in economics as well as in politics. He was, moreover, a man who 
grasped an infinity of practical details and shaped small things into 
great combinations. Such rare men make Napoleons in war and Alex: 
ander Hamiltons in peace. 
CONNECTION WITH THE POTOMAC AND JAMES RIVER COMPANIES. 
Washington’s connection with these economic enterprises, growing 
out of his early surveys, was of the greatest importance to Virginia and 
the country at large in other than commercial ways. In 1785, upon 
the final organization of the Potomac and Virginia Companies, in testi- 
mony of the gratitude of his native State for his public services, fifty 
shares of State stock in the Potomac Company and one hundred shares 
in the James River Company were presented to Washington by the leg- 
islature through Patrick Henry, then governor of Virginia. The gift 
was most embarrassing to Washington. He never thought for a mo- 
ment of accepting it; but how to decline it without giving offence—that 
was the question. He wrote to his friend Benjamin Harrison: “Not 
content with the bare consciousness of my having, in all this navigation 
business, acted with the clearest conviction of the political importance 
of the measure, I would wish that every individual who may hear that 
it was a favorite plan of mine may know also that I had no other motive 
for promoting it than the advantage of which I conceived it would be 
productive to the Union and to this State in particular, by cementing 
the eastern and western territory together, at the same time that it will 
give vigor and increase to our commerce, and be a convenience to our 
citizens. How would this matter be viewed, then, by the eye of the 
world, and what would be the opinion of it, when it comes to be related 
that George Washington has received twenty thousand dollars and five 
thousand pounds sterling of the public money as an interest therein?” 
Through Patrick Henry Washington returned to the General Assem- 
bly his grateful acknowledgments, but firmly declined to accept the 
proffered bounty. He said that he had resolutely shut his hand against 
every pecuniary recompense during the revolutionary struggle, and 
that he could not change his position now, But, he said, if the legis: 
14166—No, 1—3

lature would permit him to turn the destination of the proposed fund 
from his own private emolument to objects of a public nature, he would 
show his gratitude for the honor conferred upon him by the State by 
selecting objects which would meet the most enlightened and patriotic 
views of the Virginia Assembly. This proposition was accepted, and 
it was voted that the stock should stand appropriated to such public 
purposes as Washington might designate by deed during life or by his 
last will and testament. 
RELATION OF WASHINGTON’S ENTERPRISE TO EDUCATION. 
A proper disposition of this public stock was regarded by Washing- 
ton as a sacred obligation, and caused him long and earnest thought. 
The shares were not likely to become immediately productive, so that 
there was ample time for deliberation. The evolution of his great pur- 
pose to employ at least a portion of his trust toward the endowment of 
a national university has never been traced, but an evolution there cer- 
tainly was, and the old College of William and Mary played no unim- 
portant part in the process. The germ of his purpose originated in a 
feeling of patriotic gratitude toward Virginia soldiers who had fallen 
in defence of their country. Washington, in 1785, proposed to Edmund 
Randolph and Thomas Jefferson the idea of employing the revenue 
from his Potomac and James River stock for the establishment of two 
charity schools, one on each river, for the education of poor children, 
particularly those whose parents had fallen in defence of American lib- 
erty. This was a noble purpose, and would probaoly have been carried 
out if the stock had become productive and if Washington had not been 
chosen Chancellor of the College of William and Mary (1788) and President 
of the United States (1789). 
WASHINGTON THE CHANCELLOR OF WILLIAM AND MARY. 
One year before Washington was chosen President of the United 
States, he was elected chancellor of the College of William and Mary 
by the board of visitors. This was an ancient and venerable office 
which had been held by the bishops of London continuously from the 
foundation of the college in1693 down to the American Revolution. 
Washington was the first American elected to take up the historical 
succession to this old English ecclesiastical headship of the college. It 
was pre-eminently an honorary position, for besides the chancellor there 
was always a practical executive called the president, or rector. The 
old statutes defined the chancellor’s office as follows: “The Chancellor 
is to be the Mecenas, or patron of the college, such a one as by his favor 
with the King and by his interest with all other persons in England, 
may be enabled to help on all the college affairs. His advice is to be 
taken, especially in all such arduous and momentous affairs as the col- 
lege shall have to doin England. If the college has any petitions at 
any time to the King, let them be presented by their Chancellor, If

the college wants a new president, or professor, or master, let the col- 
lege senate rely chiefly on his assistance, advice, and recommendation.” 
In his first letter, dated Mount Vernon, February 20, 1788, respecting 
this election to the chancellorship, Washington expressed himself as 
“duly honored and greatly affected with the receipt of the resolution of 
the visitors and governors of William and Mary College,” but deferred 
his acceptance until the terms of the above statute were communicated 
to him, whereupon he wrote the following letter to Samuel Griffin, who 
had conveyed the information : : 
Mount VERNON, 30 April, 1788. 
Dear Sir: I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th of April, 
in which you did me the favor to enclose an extract from the original statute, desig- 
nating the duties of the office to which I had been appointed. Influenced by a heart- 
felt desire to promote the cause of science in general and the prosperity of the College 
of William and Mary in particular, I accept the office of chancellor in the same; and 
request you will be pleased to give official notice thereof to the learned body who 
have thought proper to honor me with the appointment. I confide fully in their 
strenuous endeavors for placing the system of education on sucl’a basis as will render 
it the most beneficial to the State and the republic of, letters, as well as to the more 
extensive interests of humanity and religion. In return they will do me the justice 
to believe that I shall not be tardy in giving my cheerful concurrence to such meas- 
ures as may be best calculated for the attainment of those desirable and important 
objects. For the expressions of politeness and friendship blended with your commu- 
nications, you are desired to receive my best acknowledgments. 
Iam, dear sir, your obedient and very humble servant, 
GEORGE WASHINGTON. 
SAMUEL GRIFFIN, Esq., 
Rector of the College of William and Mary. 
This was the beginning of George Washington’s official connection 
with the cause of liberal education in America. He was’ now the ac- 
knowledged head of the only college in Virginia, the college which had 
given him his first local office many years before. Washington’s chan- 
cellorship of William and Mary antedated his presidency of the United 
States and continued until the day of his death. The institution which 
first recognized his merits enjoyed the honor of his last public service. 
Although the duties of the chancellorship were never burdensome, they 
were nevertheless sufficiently honorable and distinguished to turn 
Washington’s attention, even while President of the United States, to 
the thought of representing for the entire country what he already rep- 
resented for Virginia. He was the actual Mzecenas or patron of learn- 
ing in his native State; what more natural than that he should advance 
from the local to the national in his ideas of education? This process 
had been characteristic of his development in relation to economies, 
war, and politics. It was in the same way that he came to the larger 
idea of his relation to science. In his mind, the College of William and 
Mary, which already in 1781 Washington had called a “university,” 
‘was an historical stepping-stone from the idea of charity schools in 
Virginia to the higher thought of a national university in the Federal 
City. Men’s minds always move along lines of individual experience

and of least resistance. There was absoiutely no other experimental 
way by which Washington could have risen from his original purpose 
to his educational ideal save through his connection with the chancellor- 
ship of William and Mary. The duties of this office were indeed trifling 
as compared with Washington’s larger political career, but the two 
lines of presidential activity ran parallel with one another, and the 
very subordination of the one office may have suggested to Washington, 
in the other, the possibility of utilizing for a great national purpose 
the idea of higher education which William and Mary represented to him 
and to all Virginians. Thomas Jefferson obtained his first idea of the 
University of Virginia from his alma mater at Williamsburg, and Wash- 
ington undoubtedly drew his national thought of education from the 
same local source. 
JEFFERSON'S RELATION TO WILLIAM AND MARY. 
The father of Thomas Jefferson was a practical surveyor, who had 
been chosen with Joshua Fry, professor of mathematics at the College 
of William and Mary, to continue the boundary line between Virginia 
and North Carolina, a task begun by Colonel Byrd. The two men were 
also employed together in making the first map of Virginia. Thus 
through association with a Williamsburg professor the father of Thomas 
Jefferson became inclined to give his son a liberal education and to train 
him to the art of surveying. This art the youth acquired, and he after- 
ward became surveyor of Albemarle County. 
Jefferson’s autobiography is the best source of information respect- 
ing his connection with the college. He says he went to William and 
Mary in the spring of 1760 and continued there two years. “It was my 
great good fortune, and what probably fixed the destinies of my life, 
that Dr. William Small of Scotland was then professor of mathemat- 
_ies,a man profound in most of the useful branches of science, with a 
happy talent of communication, correct and gentlemanly manners, aud 
an enlarged and liberal mind. He, most happily for me, became soon 
attached to me, and made me his daily companion when not engaged 
in the school; and from his conversation I got my first views of the ex- 
pansion of science, and, of the system of things in which we are placed. 
Fortunately, the philosophical chair became vacant soon after my ar- 
rival at college, and he was appointed to fill it per interim ; and he was 
the first who ever gave, in that college, regular lectures in ethics, rhet- 
oric, and belles-lettres. He returned to Europe in 1762, having pre- 
viously filled up the measure of his goodness to me, by procuring for 
me, from his most intimate friend, George Wythe, a reception as a 
student of law, under his direction, and introduced me to the acquaint- 
ance and familiar table of Governor Fauquier, the ablest man who had 
ever filled that office. With him, and at his table, Dr. Small and Mr, 
‘Wythe, his amici omnium horarum,and inyself, formed a partie quarrée, 
and to the habitual conversations on these occasions [ owed mach in-

struction. Mr. Wythe continued to be my faithful and beloved mentor 
in youth, and my most affectionate friend through life. In 1767, he led 
me into the practice of the law at the bar of the general court, at which 
I continued until the Revolution shut up the courts of justice.” 
‘Was ever éducation more liberal for the son of a Virginia farmer ? 
Here is a young man, at the age of seventeen, fresh from classical train- 
ing by scholarly Presbyterian clergymen, brought under the formative 
influence of three men of the world, the best minds in Williamsburg : 
first, Doctor Small, the Scotch mathematician and philosopher; second, 
Mr. Wythe, the lawyer who trained John Marshall at William and 
Mary; and third, Governor Fauquier, the ablest politician of his time. 
Is it surprising that a natural genius like Jefferson should have repro- 
duced the types represented by his three best teachers, and have become 
a mathematical philosopher, a scholarly lawyer, a politician, governor, 
statesman, and diplomatist ? i 
Edueational heredity is sometimes as clearly manifest as are family 
traits. The mathematical bent of Peter Jefferson, the surveyor, of Al- 
bemarle, became even more marked in the mind of his son Thomas, who 
rose, like George Washington, from the position of a county surveyor! 
to that of surveyor-general of Virginia, the agrarian representative of 
his alma mater. The old college left its stamp upon Jefferson, not 
merely as a qualified surveyor and economist, but also as a practical edu- 
eator and a lover of youth. 
JEFFERSON’S PLAN OF EDUCATION FOR VIRGINIA. 
Tt is a fact not sufficiently or generally understood that the first form 
of Jefferson’s university idea was that of transforming the College of 
William and Mary into a State university. In 1779 he reported to the 
General Assembly of Virginia three bills for the establishment of a gen- 
eral system of education in his native State. The first bill provided for 
two grades of instruction: (1) elementary schools, for the children of 
rich and poor alike ; (2) colleges for a middle degree of instruction 
to students in easy circumstances. The second bill proposed a univer- 
sity; ‘the third, a library. 
This general plan,’ of remarkable scope, deserves a more detailed ex- 
amination, for it is the historical basis of all that Jefferson subsequently 
accomplished for the educational cause in Virginia. It is closely allied ~ 
to his cherish ed scheme for local self-government in smaller units than 
the county. He proposed that every county should be subdivided into 
hundreds, wards, or townships, five or six miles square, and that in the

ferson’s appointment as county surveyor: ‘Agreed, unanimously, that Mr. Thomas 
Jefferson be appointed surveyor of Albemarle, in the room of Mr./Nicholas Lewis, who 
has sent his letter of resignation, and that he be allowed to have a deputy.”

centre of each local division there should be a free English school, in 
which reading, writing, and arithmetic should be taught. This was 
the idea of common school education, free to all children in the ward or 
township, and supported by local taxation under State authority. This 
part of Jefferson’s great plan was actually adopted by the General As- 
sembly in 1796, although the execution of the law was left optional with 
the county courts, a mistake which Jefferson said defeated his project. 
For the promotion of college education, Jefferson’s bill provided that 
the whole State should be.divided into ten or more districts, in each of 
which a college should be planted for teaching the classics, grammar, 
geography, surveying, and other useful subjects. The college, as Jef: 
ferson conceived it, was to be a classical academy or gymnasium, pre- 
paratory to the university. It was an expansion of the same idea as 
that of the colonial free school, which was free merely in the sense of 
teaching the liberal arts. This form of the free school should be his- 
torically distinguished from the free English or common school, pro- 
posed for elementary education. The college was to be the Latin school, 
with the addition of a few practical or modern studies. This part of 
Jefferson’s plan, although not actually adopted in the form proposed, 
remained one of his favorite ideas, to which he returned again and again 
in later life. . : 
The roof and crown of the entire educational system of Virginia was 
to be the old College of William and Mary, transformed into a new and 
higher seminary of learning, with all preparatory work relegated to 
the fitting schools. Jefferson distinctly states that his second bill 
“proposed to amend the constitution of William and Mary College, to 
enlarge its sphere of science, and to make it in fact a university.” In 
his autobiography Jefferson explains why this, the best part of his 
plan, failed to succeed. ‘‘The College of William and Mary was an es- 
tablishment purely of the Church of England; the visitors were required 
to be all of that church ; the professors, to subscribe to the thirty-nine 
articles; its students, to learn the catechism; and one of its funda- 
mental objects was declared to be to raise up ministers for that church. 
The religious jealousies, therefore, of all the dissenters took alarm lest 
this might give an ascendancy to the Anglican sect, and refused acting 
on that bill. Its local eccentricity, too, and unhealthy autumnal cli- 
- mate lessened the general inclination toward it.” For these and other 
reasons the College of William and Mary failed to become the State 
university of Virginia. 
JEFFERSON REMODELS THE CURRICULUM OF WILLIAM AND MARY. 
Jefferson’s interest in the cause which William and Mary originally 
represented to his mind was doubtless strengthened by the more suc- 
cessful part which he took in remodelling the scholastic curriculum of 
the college in the interest of modern studies, of which he was the first 
American champion. ‘On the ist of June, 1779,” he says in his auto-

a 
biography, “T was appointed Governor of the Commonwealth and re- 
tired from the legislature. Being elected also one of the visitors of 
William and Mary College, a self-electing body, I effected, during my 
residence in Williamsburg that year, a change in the organization of 
that institution, by abolishing the grammar school and the two profes- 
sorships of divinity and oriental languages, and substituting a profes- 
sorship of iaw and police,! one of anatomy, medicine, and chemistry, 
and one of modern languages; and the charter confining us to six pro- 
fessorships, we added the law of nature and nations and the fine arts, 
to the duties of the moral professor, and natural history to those of the 
professor of mathematics and natural philosophy.”? Thus Jefferson 
introduced the first distinctively modern currents into the curriculum 
of William and Mary. 
JEFFERSON STUDIES EUROPEAN UNIVERSITIES. 
From early convection with educational reforms at Williamsburg, Jef- 
ferson’s mind naturally turned more and more strongly toward universi- 
ties. While upon foreign missions in the interest of the United States 
he made inquiries into the best systems of university education in the 
Old World. In 1785 we find him writing from Paris to J. Bannister, 
jr., respecting the relative merits of Swiss and Italian universities—Ge- 
neva, Rome, and Pisa. At this period he was inclined to prefer Rome, 
because of its historic associations and its remarkable opportunities for 
culture in the fine arts. A little later, in 1791, he wrote to Mr. McAlis- 
ter, ‘‘ With respect to the schools of Europe my mind is perfectly made 
up, and on full inquiry. The best in the world is Edinburgh. * * * 
On the continent of Europe, no place is comparable to Geneva.” After 
his return to America he repeatedly spoke of these ancient seminaries 
of science as “the two eyes of Europe.” 
‘A curious evidence of Jefferson’s‘continued loyalty to his alma mater 
may be discovered in the above letter to Mr. Bannister: ‘But why send 
an American youth to Europe for education? What are the objects of 
auseful American education? Classical knowledge, modern languages, 
chiefly French, Spanish, and Italian, mathematics, natural philosophy, 
natural history, civil history, and ethics. In natural philosophy I mean 
to include chemistry and agriculture, and in natural history to include 
botany, as well as the other branches of these departments. It is true 
! This was much the same as the modern science of administration, which is just begin- 
ning anew to creep into our university courses in America. What the German would 
call Polizeiwissenschaft, and what the Greeks termed zoiz7 eva, was taught for nearly a 
century at the College of William and Mary under the head of ‘‘ police.” That name 
would probably suggest nothing but constabulary associations to most college facul- 
ties in these modern days. Another oxcellent term, also in danger of oblivion, long re- 
mained in current use at William and Mary, viz, ‘‘ humanity,” of which there was one 
professor.

that the habit of speaking the modern languages cannot be so well ac. 
quired in America; but every other article can be as well acquired at 
William and Mary College as at any place in Europe.” Jetterson is here 
speaking of undergraduate training. As to graduates, he admits that 
medical students ought to study abroad, but he is confident that law 
students can do quite as well by attending the law courses of Mr. 
Wythe at William and Mary. Jefferson was by no means provincial 
in this view. It should be remembered that some of the best lawyers 
and statesmen of the Revolution had been trained in Williamsburg, and 
that John Marshall,' the most distinguished Chief Justice of the United 
States, acquired a systematic knowledge of law from Professor Wythe 
during the intervals of revolutionary campaigning in Virginia, just as 
young Prussian officers at the present day attend university courses while 
stationed in Berlin. 
INFLUENCE OF THE COLLEGE OF GENEVA UPON JEFFERSON. 
One of the most remarkable results of Jefferson’s sojourn in Europe 
and of his inquiries concerning the higher education was the proposi- 
tion made to him in 1794 by Professor D’Ivernois, representing the 
Genevan faculty, ‘‘to translate the Academy of Geneva in a body to 
this country.” The faculty of that institution had fallen into disfavor 
with the revolutionary party in their republic, and proposed to emi- 
grate to Virginia, with a considerable body of Swiss farmers, provided 
they should receive the necessary encouragement. Jefferson had known 
D’Ivernois in Paris, and had very great respect for his character and 
attainments. In a letter to Washington, Jefferson speaks of D’Ivernois 
as a man of science and as author of a history of the republic of Geneva. 
He further describes the Genevan faculty: Mouchon, the President, 
famous for his work with the encyclopedists; Pictet, the natural phi- 
losopher, who had measured a degree with scientific accuracy ; Bertrand 
and L’Huillier, the mathematicians, second only, in all Europe, to La 
Grange; De Saussure, the geologist, celebrated for his ‘Alpine re- 
searches; Senebier, translator of the Greek tragedians; all together a 
faculty of ten or twelve professors. Jefferson said, ‘The names of 
Mouchon, Pictet, De Saussure, and Senebier are well known to me as 
standing foremost among the literati of Europe.” He thinks the revo- 
lution in France will incline La Grange also, “who is without equal” 
as a mathematician, to join the Swiss professors in their proposed ex- 
odus. It was a scheme of dazzling brilliancy, and Jefferson was evi- 
dently much impressed with its possibilities, for he wrote to Washington 
a very elaborate account of the whole matter. ; 
Jefferson had previously submitted the project of the Geneva pro- 
fessors to influential members of the General Assembly of Virginia for 
private discussion, but the scheme had been judged impracticable, be-

cause of (1) the great expense; (2) the necessity which would arise of 
teaching American youth in the French or Latin languages; and (3) 
the very grandeur of the enterprise, which was out of all proportion to 
the population and needs of Virginia. Jefferson now appealed to Wash- 
ington as a final resort, knowing that he had contemplated the gift of 
his stock in the Potomac and James River Companies toward the es- 
tablishment of a national university. Jefferson urged that the State 
which had organized these companies and which paid the dividends 
ought to be chiefly favored in the disposition which Washington might 
make of his stock. He suggested that the Virginians would be satisfied 
if the university were placed within their ‘borders, and that a happy 
compromise might be effected between the ideas of a national anda 
State institution, by planting it near the Federal City. 
INFLUENCS OF THE GENEVA PROJECT UPON WASHINGTON. 
Washington had already heard of the project of the Swiss professors . 
from John Adams, to whom D’[vernois had also written. To both 
Adams and Jefferson the President communicated his unfavorable opin- 
ion of the Swiss proposition. To Jefferson he gave a specific statement 
of his views to the effect that (1) the plan for a national university was 
not sufficiently matured to justify any encouragement to the Swiss pro- 
fessors ; (2) the propriety of transplanting the entire body of them was 
questionable, for they might not all be good characters or sufficiently ac- 
quainted with the English language ; (3) the Swiss professors had been 
at variance with the popular party at home, and their introduction to 
America might be considered an aristocratic movement; (4) such an in- 
vitation to the Swiss “might preclude some of the first professors in 
other countries from a participation” in the national university. Wash- 
ington suggests that “some of the most celebrated characters in Scot- 
land, in this line, might be obtained.” 
Thus in matters pertaining to the highest education, as already in 
economics, war, politics, and diplomacy, George Washington showed 
his sovereign common sense. From whatever point of view the char- 
acter of the greatest of Virginians is seen, his wisdom and judgment 
impress the beholder. He was not disposed to subordinate the idea of an 
American university to the importation en masse of any foreign colony 
of professors, even though they constituted the best single faculty in 
continental Europe. He was inclined to take a thoroughly scientific 
and broadly international view of the educational question. If Scot- 
land had a better professor of philosophy than the Genevan, he wanted 
the Scotchman. 
While discouraging the idea of transplanting a foreign university to 
these American shores, Washington proceeded to take immediate steps 
toward the realization of his own long-cherished plan of founding a 
national university. Returning the Swiss papers to John Adams on the 
27th of November, 1794, he said: ‘That a national university in this  
-P-A-G-E-50
  
42 CIRCULARS OF INFORMATION FOR 1887. 
country is a thing to be desired, has always been my decided opinion ; 
and the appropriation of ground and funds for it in the Federal City 
has long been contemplated and talked of.” It is evident that a new 
impetus was now given to this old idea, born of William and Mary Col- 
lege. In less than three weeks after writing to Adams, Washington 
addressed a letter to Edmund Randolph, Secretary of State, requesting 
that he and James Madison should mature the proper course for him in 
disclosing his design to give his stock of fifty shares in the Potomac 
Company toward the endowment of a university in the District of Co- 
lumbia. As previously explained, this stock, together with one hundred. 
shares in the James River Company, had been given to Washington for 
his public services by the legislature of Virginia, and he now wished to 
have the approbation of that body with regard to his proposed dispo- 
sition of the shares first named for a national university. On the 28th of 
January, 1795, Washington informed the commissioners of the Federal 
_ City that he had vested in perpetuity fifty shares of Potomac stock to- 
ward the above object. This was done before the receipt of Jefferson’s 
letter, dated at Monticello, February 22, 1795, respecting D’Ivernois’s 
proposition, which had already come to Washington’s notice through 
John Adams at least three months earlier... The Swiss idea had its in- 
fluence upon both of the great Virginians, but it stimulated Washington 
to immediate action. When he heard Jefferson’s version of the Swiss 
scheme he wrote to him, “I have in a degree anticipated your proposi- 
tion,” in so far as it related to the application of stock in the Potomac 
Company to the endowment of a national university. Washington said 
he was inclined to apply the James River shares to the same purpose, 
but, “considering the source from whence they were derived, I have, in 
a letter I am writing to the executive of Virginia on this subject, left 
the application of them to a seminary within the State, to be located by 
the legislature.” The very next day, March 16, 1795, Washington 
wrote to Robert Brooke, Governor of Virginia, proposing to vest his 
Potomac stock in a national university and his James River shares in a 
Virginia institution. His proposition was favorably received by the 
Governor and General Assembly. 
Clearly the transition from the charity schools to the university idea 
was now complete. And yet it is interesting to note that Washington 
had been giving fifty pounds a year for the instruction of poor children - 
in Alexandria, and he had not neglected to offer educational aid to the 
sons of soldiers. The idea of promoting State education survived in 
Washington’s proposal to give his James River stock to “a seminary 
of learning upon an enlarged plan, but yet not. coming up to the full 
idea of a university. * * * The students who wish to pursue the 
whole range of science may pass with advantage from the seminary to 
the university, and the former by a due relation may be rendered co- 
operative with the latter.” Washington said that he would have pre- 
ferred to concentrate all his resources upon a national university in the

Federal City; but, in deference to Virginia sentiment, to which he owed 
his very means of philanthropy, he gave a portion to Liberty Hall 
Academy, now Washington and Lee University. 
WASHINGTON’S IDEA OF A NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. 
The educational ideal of Washington was thoroughly American. He 
wrote to Governor Brooke of Virginia: “It is with indescribable re- 
gret that I have seen the youth of the United States migrating to for- 
eign countries, in order to acquire the higher branches of erudition, 
and to obtain a knowledge of the sciences. Although it would be in- 
justice to many to pronounce the certainty of their imbibing maxims 
not congenial with republicanism, it must nevertheless be admitted that 
a serious danger is encountered by sending abroad among other polit- 
ical systems those who have not well learned the value of their own. 
The time is therefore come when a plan of universal education ought 
to be adopted in the United States. Not only do the exigencies of pub- 
lic and private life demand it, but, if it should ever be apprehended 
that prejudice would be entertained in one part of the Union against 
another, an efficacious remedy will be to assemble the youth of every 
part under such circumstances as will, by the freedom of intercourse 
and collision of sentiment, give to their minds the direction of truth, 
philanthropy, and mutual conciliation.” 
The following passage, taken from Washington’s last will and testa- 
ment, best conveys his ideas upon the subject of a national university: 
“It has always been a source of serious regret with me, to see the 
youth of these United States sent to foreign countries for the pur- 
pose of education, often before their minds were formed, or they had 
imbibed any adequate ideas of the happiness of their own; contracting 
too frequently, not only habits of dissipation and extravagance, but 
principles unfriendly to republican government, and to the true and 
genuine liberties of mankind, which thereafter are rarely overcome; for 
these reasons it has been my ardent wish to see a plan devised on alib- 
eral scale, which would have a tendency to spread systematic ideas 
through all parts of this rising empire, thereby to do away local attach- 
ments and State prejudices, as far as the nature of things would, or in- 
deed ought to admit, from our national councils. Looking anxiously 
‘forward te the accomplishment of so desirable an object as this is (in 
my estimation), my mind has not been able to contemplate any plan 
more likely to effect the measure, than the establishment of a UNIVER- 
SITY ina central part of the United States, to which the youths of fort- 
une and talents from all parts thereof may be sent for the completion 
of their education, in all the branches of polite literature, in arts and 
sciences, in acquiring knowledge in the principles of politics and good gov- 
ernment, and, as a matter of infinite importance in my judgment, by as- 
sociating with each other, and forming friendships.in juvenile years, be 
enabled to free themselves in a proper degree from those local preju-  
-P-A-G-E-52

dices and habitual jealousies which have just been mentioned, and 
which, when carried to excess, are never-failing sources of disquietude 
to the public mind, and pregnant of mischievous consequences to this 
country. Under these impressions, so fully dilated, 
“I give and bequeath, in perpetuity, the fifty shares which I holdin 
the Potomac Company (under the aforesaid acts of the Legislature of 
Virginia), towards the endowment of a university, to be established 
within the limits of the District of Columbia, under the auspices of the 
General Government, if that Government should incline to extend a 
fostering hand towards it; and, until such seminary is established, and 
the funds arising on these shares shall be required for its support, my 
further will and desire is, that the profit accruing therefrom shall, when- 
ever the dividends are made, be laid out in purchasing stock in the 
Bank of Columbia, or some other bank, at the discretion of my execu- 
tors, or by the Treasurer of the United States for the time being, under 
the direction of Congress, provided that honorable body should patro- 
nize the measure; and the dividends proceeding fram the purchase of 
such stock are to be vested in more stock, and so on, until a sum ade- 
quate to the accomplishment of the object is obtained; of which I have 
not the smallest doubt before many years pass away, even if no aid or 
encouragement is given by the legislative authority, or from any other 
source.” 
Washington’s gift of stock in the James River Company to Liberty 
Hall in Virginia became productive. The State seminary which he 
designed to be preparatory to the national university has evolved into 
a flourishing institution of learning; but that “full idea” suggested by 
the chancellor of William and Mary was never realized in the form 
which he originally intended. Congress did not extend its fostering 
hand. The affairs of the Potomac Company were ultimately merged in 
the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company (see Pickell’s History of the 
Potomac Company). Sparks, in his Life of Washington, page 416, says, 
“the shares appropriated by Washington’s will are doubtless held in 
trust” by the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, “for their destined 
object.” The actual fate of Washington’s endowment of a national uni- 
versity would be a good subject for a congressional inquiry, when other 
scientific subjects are exhausted. It appears from a report of the Ches- 
apeake and Ohio Canal Company, in 1851, page 20, that only one divi- 
dend was ever paid upon the Potomac stock; but the above canal is 
there described ‘‘as merely carrying out in a more perfect form the de- 
sign of General Washington, and as naturally resulting from the views 
and measures originally suggested by him.” : 
In this connection it is interesting to observe that, along the very 
route which Washington thought would become “the channel of the 
extensive and valuable trade of a rising empire,” was constructed, not 
only the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, but the Baltimore and Ohio 
Railroad. It is still more interesting to reflect that a gift of stock in
-P-A-G-E-53
THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. 45 
this road formed the chief endowment of the Johns Hopkins University, 
which, if not national in name, is national in spirit, and is striving to 
realize Washington’s “full idea of a university.” Baltimore is not 
alone in representing the true university spirit, but from her geograph- 
ical position, midway between North and South and hard by the nation’s 
capital, she is approximating to Washington’s ideal of an institution 
where young men from all parts of the Union “may be sent for the com- 
pletion of their education * * * in arts and sciences, in acquiring 
knowledge in the principles of politics and good government, and * * * 
be enabled to free themselves in a proper degree from local prejudices 
and habitual jealousies.” 
American students are to-day moving upon the great current of na- 
tional university life, such a current as would have rejoiced the mind 
and heart of George Washington, could he have foreseen the national 
representation of this country in our leading colleges and universities. 
We are enjoying the practical realization of a grand idea, but it is not 
unreasonable to inquire whether the present cosmopolitan spirit in 
American student life might not have begun to develop at a much earlier 
period if Congress had given some attention to Washington’s earnest 
recommendations. Supposing a school of politics and good government, 
in connection with other liberal arts and sciences, had been planted in 
the city of Washington, under the auspices of the United States, at the 
very beginning of the present century, before the sectional issue had 
become paramount in American politics, would there not have been 
some chance for the development of a school of well-trained, public- 
spirited men, of broad-minded statesmen, competent to settle economic 
and constitutional questions, without leading the country into fratri- 
cidal war, costing millions of men and untold treasure? The simple ex- 
periment would at least have been inexpensive compared with that 
actually essayed. England and Germany were able to rid their domin- 
ions of slavery and serfdom by legislative means, and possibly the 
United States might have done the same thing by the education of a 
school of really patriotic politicians, who could have risen above sec- 
tional issues, or those “ local attachments and State prejudices” which 
Washington feared, and who could have developed the healthful Vir- 
ginia sentiment of Jefferson and of the eighteenth century into an irre- 
sistible national opinion. 
Washington early attempted to impress upon Congress “how much 
a flourishing state of the arts and sciences contributes to national prosperity 
and reputation.” He foreshadowed the scientific policy of the nation 
when he pointed out its duty in these matters. He intimated that the 
higher education could never reach its highest estate without national 
aid. “True it is,” he observed, “that our country, much to its honor, 
contains many seminaries of learning highly respectable and useful; 
but the funds upon which they rest are too narrow to command the 
ablest professors, in the different departments of liberal knowledge, for
-P-A-G-E-54
    
46 CIRCULARS OF INFORMATION FOR 1887. 
the institution contemplated, though they would be excellent auxili- 
aries.” ; 
The father of his country wished to save the United States on the 
one hand from provincialism, and on the other from sectionalism. Un- 
doubtedly, in his mind, the national idea was uppermost: “ Amongst 
the motives to such an institution,” he said, ‘the assimilation of the 
principles, opinions, and manners of our countrymen, by the common 
education of a portion of our youth from every quarter, well deserves 
attention. The more homogeneous our citizens can be made in these 
particulars, the greater will be our prospect of permanent union; and 
a primary object of such a national institution should be the education of 
our youth in the science of government. In a republic, what species of 
knowledge can be equally important, and what duty more pressing on 
its legislature, than to patronize a plan for communicating it to. those 
who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the country?” 
WASHINGTON’S UNIVERSITY IDEA COMPARED WITH JEFFERSON’S. 
In his appeal to Washington that he should employ his stock in the 
Virginia navigation companies for the transfer of the Swiss college to 
America, Jefferson had strongly urged the claims of Virginia as a site 
for the proposed institution. He was the champion of the idea of a 
university for his own State, although there was nothing provincial in 
his advocacy. He clearly recognized that the transfer of what he con- 
sidered the greatest university in continental Europe would give “such 
an éclat and such solid advantages, as would insure a very géneral con- 
course to it of the youths from all our States, and probably from the 
other parts of America, which are free enough to adopt it.” Neverthe- 
less, Jefferson’s thought was clearly that of a university for Virginia. 
It might be “‘near enough to the Federal capital to be regarded as an 
appendage,” but it should be within Virginia’s limits, and thus “the 
splendor of the two objects would reflect usefully on each other.” Jef: 
ferson foresaw two great capitals of the nation, one of them political, 
situated in the City of Washington; the other, intellectual, situated in 
Virginia, retired from the world. A shadow of monasticism clung to 
the free-thinking Jefferson. His university was to be ‘so far from the 
Federal City as moral considerations would recommend.” The youth 
were to be protected from temptation by placing them at a safe distance 
from municipal society. His idea was that of a rural Oxford or Cam- 
bridge lying over against an American London. It was the historic 
idea of most English and American colleges. It is an idea both sound 
and healthful, from many points of view, and it will undoubtedly endure 
in school and college as long as country life and human nature endure. 
In American educational history this idea has shown more vitality and 
has received more vigorous support than have national or municipal 
ideas in education; but these latter have a latent strength which will

one day appear, especially in the higher education of great cities like 
New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington. 
In his letter to Jefferson, March 15, 1795, Washington said he had 
little hesitation in giving the Federal City preference over. all other 
places for the institution, because (1) that city 1s the permanent seat of 
the government of this Union, and there its laws and policy are better 
understood than elsewhere ; (2) Washington is central, midway between 
the North and the South; (3) the District of Columbia is convenient of 
access for the whole State of Virginia; (4) his own private bequest, in- 
adequate in itself, would become useful as part of a national endow- 
ment; (5) jurisdiction by the General Government would give the uni- 
versity advantages which no other place than the City of Washington 
would possess; ‘‘and lastly, as this seminary is contemplated for the 
completion of education and study of the sciences, not for boys in their 
rudiments, it will afford the students an opportunity of attending the 
debates in Congress, and thereby becoming more liberally and better 
acquainted with the principles of law and government.” 
This was Washington’s cherished idea of a national university. It 
was primarily the idea of a national school of politics and administration, 
taught in connection with other liberal arts and sciences, in the capital 
city of the United States, for the highest education of American youth. 
It was an idea born of the old College of William and Mary, where cap- 
itol and college faced each other, and where the statesmen of Virginia 
had been trained for their great work of liberating the colonies and of 
framing a federal constitution. The idea of a national university grew 
in Washington’s mind with his own official connection as chancellor of 
William and Mary, with his election and re-election as President of 
these United States, with the establishment of the District of Columbia 
and of the nation’s capital on the borders of Virginia, with his enlarged 
opportunity of employing Virginia’s gift for a purpose at once national 
and Virginian, with the growing desire ofthis old age to see his country 
permanently united and to leave it in a state of enduring peace. 
WASHINGTON’S VIEWS OF MILITARY EDUCATION. 
The great idea did not die with Washington. It has been transmitted 
by successive generations of men and it remains a legacy to the future. 
There is one national institution which owes its origin to Washington’s 
foresight, and that is the Military Academy at West Point. Suggested 
to Congress in the same speech wherein he recommended a national uni- 
versity, this government institution has by its untarnished record and in-* 
estimable services to the country more than vindicated the wisdom of its 
great advocate. Washington said to Congress: ‘‘ However pacific the 
general policy of a nation may be, it ought never to be without an ade- 
quate stock of military knowledge for emergencies.” He maintained 
that a dearth of such knowledge would impair the energy of its char- 
acter, hazard its safety, or expose it to even greater evils when war

could not be avoided. “The art of war,” he said, ‘is at once compre- 
hensive and complicated; it demands much previous study.” The 
United States discovered the depth of this wisdom by the sad experience * 
of a protracted civil war. The sectional division of-regular army offi- 
cers in that unhappy conflict was caused by sectional strife in politics, — 
from which neither States, nor families, nor men could escape; but the 
very sectional distribution of military skill and martial discipline was 
one of the most redeeming features of the war, for it prevented un- 
trained masses of men on both sides from reverting to general bush- 
whacking and primitive savagery. 
PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF WEST POINT. 
West Point represents more than the continuity of military science, 
which is indeed indispensable in all civilized states, whether for exter- 
nal defence or the preservation of domestic peace. The Military Acad- 
emy stands for the historical continuity, under national auspices, of 
that very idea which made Washington first in peace after the Ameri- 
can Revolution. It is the idea of strengthening the country by inter- 
nalimprovement, and binding its different sections indissolubly together 
by ties of economic interest, such as river improvements, canals, roads, 
bridges, and other great public works described under the comprehen- 
sive name of engineering. The constant employment of army engineers 
in such ways by the national Government, and in the direction of pub- 
lic works in our large cities, for example, in Philadelphia and New York, 
indicates what West Point education is worth in these piping times of 
peace. : 
Another practical lesson suggested by the Military Academy and by 
the regular army organization, recruited from it, is that of a national 
system of civil service, recruited at government training schools. Wash- 
ington’s saying concerning the art cf war might well be applied to the 
art of administration: it “is at once comprehensive and complicated ; 
it demands much previous study; the possession of it, in its most im- 
proved and perfect state, is always of great moment to the security of 
anation. This, therefore, ought to be a serious care of every Govern- 
ment; and for this purpose, an academy, where a regular course of in- 
struction is given, is an obvious expedient, which different nations have 
successfully employed.” The schools of administration now flourishing 
in Paris and Berlin are based upon precisely the same idea as that pro- 
posed by Washington in his plan for a national university in the Fed- 
eral City. 
INFLUENCE OF WILLIAM AND MARY UPON THE SOUTH. 
If any justification were to be sought for the national idea in educa- 
tion, it might be found in the historical influence of a single institution 
like the College of William and Mary upon the entire South. If one 
small institution, inadequately endowed and struggling against many

depressing conditions, could nevertheless send currents of intellectual 
life throughout every southern State, much more such an institution 
as that proposed by George Washington, if supported by the prestige 
and resources of the national Government, would have exerted a health- 
ful, wholesome influence upon the country at large. 
It is interesting to trace the widening influence of the College of Will- 
iam and Mary as shown by the catalogue of students educated at that 
institution. The writer has examined with some care the lists of names 
and residences, representing the whole clientage of the institution, and 
has corrected his own results by the further inquiries of one of his stu- 
dents from the South. Ithas been ascertained, asmight perhaps have 
been expected, that, during the colonial period, the student representation 
at William and Mary was largely provincial. During the eighteenth cen- 
tury there were only six students from outside Virginia. Four of these 
came from Maryland and two from North Carolina. In sharp contrast 
to this small number of students from outside the Old Dominion stands 
the list of 708 Virginians and 14 Indians! These numbers are fairly 
wellauthenticated. Probably there were many more, for the records of 
William and Mary are very imperfect. From the beginning of the pres- 
ent century down to the outbreak of the civil war, when the coliege was 
temporarily broken up, the distribution of students by States is clearly 
shown in the following table, prepared by Mr. C, L. Smith, of Raleigh, 
N. C., a graduate of Wake Forest College, and now holding a univer- 
sity scholarship in Baltimore.

1 The Spotswood Letters, ii, 64, speak of seventeen Indians as studying at William 
and Mary in Governor Spotswood’s time: ‘‘ Upon the encouragement of a fund set- 
tled on ye Colledge by the deceas’d Mr. Robert Boyle, I endeavour’d to dispose our 
Tributary Indians to send hither their children to be taught and educated in ye Chris- 
tian faith, and accordingly 17 of their boys are now at the Colledge.” At least four- 
teen Indians are mentioned by name in the collective catalogue, 
The subject of Indian education in this country would be worth investigating his- 
torically. Valuable materials for beginning the subject in Virginia, where the Hamp- 
ton school for Indian training now flourishes, may be found in E. D. Neill’s Virginia 
Vetusta. The first thought of a school or college for Virginia was the idea of an In- 
dian mission school. American education is almost as closely connected with the 
church, historically speaking, as are the monastic and cathedral schools of mediwyal.

  50 CIRCULARS OF INFORMATION FOR 1887. 
The student representation, as shown by this table, is overwhelmingly 
Virginian, as compared with the numbers from other States; but it is 
interesting to see how many came from beyond Virginia’s borders, par- 
ticularly from North Carolina and Alabama. In all probability the 
representatives of these States were, to some extent, returning waves 
of colonial influence which went forth from old Virginia into all the 
South, as New England influence pervaded the West. Virginians who 
went from the Old Dominion as pioneers sent back their sons to be edu- 
eated at William and Mary. While the above figures by no means stand 
- for the educated classes of the South (for every State soon developed 
colleges of its own), the table at least shows that the influence of Will- 
iam and Mary touched every State south of Mason and Dixon’s line, 
even penetrating Louisiana and distant Missouri. 
North of Mason and Dixon’s line the influence of William and Mary 
was not so marked. From 1800 to 1861, only eleven northern men 
came to Williamsburg to be educated. Of the three students from 
Massachusetts, two, namely Henry A. Dearborn, son of General Dear- 
born, Secretary of War, and Benjamin Crowningshield, soh of the Sec- 
retary of the Navy, doubtless came for local reasons, because their 
fathers were temporariiy in Washington. While southern students 
went in considerable numbers to Yale, Harvard, and Princeton, north- 
ern students were almost unknown in the annals of southern colleges. 
And yet the College of William and Mary was an excellent institu- 
tion; it had a faculty which trained some very eminent public men. 
Indeed the conspicuous merit of southern leaders in politics was due 
to their superior political education, which early ranged over topics 
that were not prominent in northern colleges until after the War, 
notably history, political economy, and the science of government and 
administration. The University of Virginia, which evolved from old 
William and Mary by a process of historical evolution, represented, 
from its very beginning, the true university spirit and very advanced 
methods of teaching by lectures. It commanded some of the best pro- 
fessorial talent which this country has ever seen, for Jefferson, acting 
upon an idea derived from his Geneva project, secured the services of 
highly distinguished teachers from Europe, notably George Long, the 
historian of Rome. Nevertheless, Virginia failed to draw any consider- 
. able number of students from the North. 
tis easy to suggest explanations of this general fact. It may be ac- 
counted for by a variety of causes, such as climate, the existence of ex- 
cellent schools and colleges at the North, the difficulty and expense of 
travel, preference for denominational institutions, social and political 
differences; but undeniably there was more or less of provincialism 
and a decided sectionalism in American college education, North and 
South. There was no help for it. Washington’s great scheme for a 
national university in the Federal City had come to naught. There was 
no choice for American youth except to follow obediently in the tracks 
e

of local prejudice in which their fathers had trod. With due allowance 
for exceptions, it may be truly said that education kept within the lines 
which politics had drawn. Northern students rarely came south ; and 
southerners, if they went north to college, remained southern in spirit. 
The College of William and Mary nevertheless continued to enlarge 
its influence, chiefly within southern borders, although many of her 
graduates acquired a national reputation in public life. It is forcibly 
said by a writer on William and Mary College: “It sent out nearly 
twenty members of Congress, fifteen United States Senators, seventeen 
Governors, thirty-seven judges, a Lieutenant-General [Winfield Scott] 
and other high officers to the Army, two commodores to the Navy, 
twelve professors, seven Cabinet officers; the chief draughtsman and 
author of the Constitution, Edmund Randolph; the most eminent of the 
Chief Justices, John Marshall; and three Presidents of the United 
States. And this list, honorable as it is, by no means exhausts the 
number of really eminent and influential men who owed the formation 
and development of their intellects and characters to William and Mary. 
In the long list of students preserved trom 1720 to the present time 
will be found a great array of names holding a very high rank in the 
Commonwealth of Virginia and the States of the South and West—in 
the pulpit, at the bar, and in the local legislatures. These, without at- 
taining the eminence of those first mentioned, were the most prominent 
citizens of the communities where they lived, and were chiefly instru- 
mental in giving character.and direction to social and political affairs.”! 
INFLUENCE OF WILLIAM AND MARY COLLEGE ON KENTUCKY AND 
TENNESSEE. 
The following extracts from an article in the Courier-Journal of Louis- 
ville, Ky., are interesting illustrations of the influence of William and 
Mary College upon Kentucky and Tennessee: 
The first Kentuckian entered as a student at William and Mary apparently was Wm. 
T. Barry, a member of the class of 1803, and in later life Postmaster-General of the 
United States. Another member of the same class was A. W. C. Logan, of Kentucky. 
Richard C. Anderson, of Kentucky, first minister to Colombia, South America (so 
the catalogue tells us), was of the class of 1804, and he had as a classmate Winfield 
Scott, of Dinwiddie County, Virginia, in which the battle-scarred city of Petersburg 
is located. Dinwiddie County gets its name from a royal governor who presided 
over the destinies of Virginia from 1752 to 1758, and it was during his administration 
that Braddock’s defeat occurred and Washington’s fame as a soldier dawned. This 
same Winfield Scott was destined to command Kentuckians on many stricken fields 
of Canada and Mexico in later years. The Crittendens were at Williamsburg in 
1805~06, and for a term or two later. John J. Crittenden lived in the traditions of 
Williamsburg for fifty years after he left college in 1807. He was of Welsh blood on 
his father’s side and of Huguenot maternal ancestry. The son of a revolutionary 
officer, what more natural than that the Woodford County youth should seek mental 
nurture at the fountain where revolutionary sages and patriots had grown in wisdom,

and should take with him all the Kentucky boys he could induce to accompany him 
to the classic shades of Williamsburg? The late President Tyler, who had little 
reason to like General Scott, who joined the Whig leaders in their assaults upon his 
administration, used to tell of the admiration felt in Williamsburg for the high- 
spirited and talented Kentucky youths who were his classmates, and whom Scott 
cultivated with poor success. The acrid and haughty demeanor of the future General- 
in-chief of the armies of the Union had little of genuine sympathy from the bonhomie 
of the rollicking youth of Eastern Virginia and their Kentucky cousins, who had 
come from their distant homes to be educated in the political faith and the humani- 
ties which were conspicuous features of the training at William and Mary. Jefferson 
and Monroe and the elder Tyler, the Harrisons for generations, the Tylers and John 
Marshall, had gone through that wholesome curriculum to become the apostles of the 
Revolution. What better school for the youth of succeeding generations? In the 
class of 1807 was J. Hawkins, of Kentucky, whom the catalogue mentions as suc- 
cessor of Henry Clay in Congress. The catalogue is more specific as to Robert Wash, 
of Kentucky, who, in the class of 1808, graduated as bachelor of law, and became 
a judge in Missouri. Did: Kentucky fill up so rapidly with immigrants that young 
Wash had to imitate Daniel Boone and seek room in the western wilds? Nathaniel 
Smith matriculated as a student in 1808 from Kentucky, and in 1809 John Croghan, 
of Kentucky, graduated as bachelor of arts, while a fellow student and Kentuckian 
was Charles Todd, who, the catalogue says, was afterwards minister to Russia. Of 
special interest to Louisville and its neighborhood is the career of George Croghan, 
who, in 1810, took his diploma as baghelor of arts, and returned to his home, near 
Louisville, crowned with college honors. The next year he was with Harrison at 
Tippecanoe and earned a captain’s commission. At Fort Meigs, May 5, 1813, he was 
aide-de-camp to Harrison, and there is little wonder that ‘‘Old Tippecanoe” should 
have chosen him for the desperate enterprise of holding Fort Sandusky, so essential 
to the integrity of Harrison’s communications. That defence of Fort Sandusky, 
located on the present site of the town of Fremont, in Ohio, is a thrilling story of 
valor and patriotism. A Kentucky youth, born in 1791, graduating with high honor 
in 1810 at the alma mater of the statesmen of the pre-revolutionary period, is found 
in 1814, when just 23, holding a position of vital consequence with 160 riflemen 
against a British force of regulars and Indians of ten, times their number. Sunset 
found the foe in full flight. The demanded surrender did not take place. The savage 
allies of England had no chance to scalp Croghan’s boys; Kentucky rifles had dealt 
death unerringly ; Harrison’s communications were saved and Croghan was a hero. 
So was Andrew Jackson, when, during his administration, he destroyed papers con- 
taining charges against Croghan, then a veteran officer in the Army, declaring that 
the ‘‘defender of Fort Sandusky has a right to commit the offence charged against 
him whenever he d—d pleases.” Croghan died at New Orleans, singularly enough, 
on the 8th of January, 1849—date and locality, commemorative of ‘Old Hickory’s” 
defeat of the British, also commemorate his justice to a hero and patriot. 
The roll of Kentucky’s alumni of William and Mary ends with the name of George 
W. Richardson, of the class of 1836—37. Chancellor Bibb was. at Williamsburg, us 
a student from Prince Edward County, early in the century. He emigrated to Ken- 
tucky afterward. The Kentucky Speeds had their progenitorsin the tobacco-growing 
sections of Virginia. A classmate of one of them in 1825 (the Speeds were educated 
at Williamsburg) was ex-Secretary of the Interior Stuart, of the Fillmore Cabinet, 
still alive, and the oldest living alumnus of William and Mary, save ex-Governor 
Wyndham Robertson, who lives in Southwest Virginia.

William and Mary remained the leading educational institution south of Boston 
until after the dawn of the present century. In some of its schools, notably that of 
law, presided over by Judge Tucker, uncle of Representative Randolph Tucker, and 
half-brother of John Randolph of Roanoke. and that of history and economy, in charge

of Professor Dew, its influence was projected into the thought of a full half of the cur- 
‘rent century. The social characteristics of Williamsburg yielded siowly. The glam- 
our of vice-royalty lingered. Sir Roger de Coverley, the minuet, and the old English 
country dances yielded to something more modern, as the dances of twenty-five years 
ago have given place to the german. Leading lawyers still lived at the old capital, 
among them George Wythe, under whom Henry Clay subsequently studied law at 
Richmond. Wythe was a signer of the Declaration of Independence and an emi- 
nent jurist. He died at Williamsburg, poisoned by his nephew, and on the highest 
colored authority I am assured that the ghost of Chancellor Wythe revisits the cham- 
ber in which he died on the anniversary of his death, making no other sign of his 
presence than passing an icy hand over the face of the sleeping occupant of the room. 
There are other ‘‘spooks” in Williamsburg, among them that of a young French 
officer, who died during the occupation of the town by the armies of Washington and. 
Rochambeau, and who insists upon showing himself in the mansion where he died. 
When the Kentucky boys crossed the mountains and came through Southwest Vir- 
ginia, via Lynchburg and Richmond, and took the old stage-coach down the penin- 
sula for Williamsburg, the Jeffersonian Democratic idea was omnipotent in Virginia, 
as it was in Kentucky. Perhaps that was why their Kentucky parents wanted them 
at William and Mary. There could be no danger of the boys falling into the ‘‘here- 
sies of Federalism” where the ideas of Jefferson and Madison were the almost undis- 
puted creed. Although John Marshall and Light-horse Harry Lee were not without 
ample following in Upper Virginia of their Washingtonian and Hamiltonian Feder- 
alism, the Alien and Sedition Laws and the general course of the Adams administra- 
tion settled the political faith of both Virginia and her daughter Kentucky for a long 
term of years. Jefferson made Kentucky the chosen field for the promulgation of 
strict-construction States’ rights doctrines. Kentucky led Virginia in adopting the 
Resolutions of ’98. Meanwhile, Washingtun and Patrick Henry died in the same 
year, 1799, and their great personal popularity was lost to the party of Federalism. 
In 1801 Jefferson became President, and the tide of national feeling ran altogether in 
favor of the Jeffersonian Republican-Democratic party, and that party was nothing 
if not bitterly and proscriptively anti-Federalist and anti-British. Those Kentucky 
and Virginia boys at William and Mary studied the humanities and law and politicg 
in thrilling times. Jefferson was active in promoting the overthrow of all pro-English 
sympathies, even in dress and manners. Powder and silk stockings, and swords and 
etiquette, gave way to democratic simplicity in ‘attire and address. Some of the 
Kentucky boys were at William and Mary when the Leopard fired upon the Chesa- 
peake. Scott hurried from college to get a commission in the Army, not even taking 
time to get his diploma. Croghan carried his sheepskin with him, and his heirs 
should value above price the parchment that proclaims the successful student at 
the oldest of Virginia institutions, who was to add greatly to Kentucky’s renown 
in war. The course of events throughout Jefferson’s administration prefigured the 
war with England which followed during Madison’s administration, and which settled 
American political supremacy, with the brief interregnum of 1825~29, for more than 
forty years in favor of the Democratic-Republican party. Virginia and Kentucky 
divided at last when the test was loyalty to Jackson—Virginia believing in Jackson 
as the heir to the leadership of Jefferson. A son of Virginia, Henry Clay, led his 
adopted State away from Jackson and Van Buren ultimately, and he was helped to 
do so by John J. Crittenden, who became Attorney-General under Harrison, while 
his old class-mate at William and Mary, John Tyler, was made Vice-President. John 
- Tyler was not the only Virginian who believed in the Kentucky judgment as to Jack- 
son, for he was sustained powerfully in his anti-Jacksonism by Littleton Waller 
Tazewell and Benjamin Watkins Leigh, both of whom were eminent United States 
Senators. 
Tenncssee contributed to William and Mary neither so early as Kentucky nor so 
many students. The catalogue gives as the first Tennesseean who was a student at 
Williamsburg, D. C. Topp, who graduated as bachelor of law in 1829 and 1830, and  
-P-A-G-E-62
  54 CIRCULARS OF INFORMATION FOR 1887. 
in the matriculation book he is registered as the son of John Topp. In 1835-36, 
James Oldham is registered as from Tennessee, and among the older dames of Wil- 
liamsburg I have heard much pleasant reference to the agreeable characteristics of 
this gentleman. In 1838-39 and 1840-’41, James Buchanan, John W. McKessack, 
Wm. F. Wood, and Samuel White were students hailing from Tennessee. The cata- 
logue refers to Mr. Wood as having taken the degrees of bachelor of arts and bachelor 
of law, and to Samuel White as the son of Judge Hugh L. White. This was the 
Judge Hugh Lawson White whom Henry A. Wise mentions in his Seven Decades as 
the ‘“‘ Cato of America.” It was Judge White that, previous to the Harrisburg con- 
vention which nominated Harrison and Tyler for President and Vice-President, 
warned Mr. Clay of the combinations of the New York politicians to defeat his nomi- 
nation by the Whigs. The last matriculate from Tennessee before the war was 
Edmund T. Wilkins, ‘‘son of Dr. Benjamin Wilkins, a distinguished physician, and 
superintendent of the California Lunatic Asylum,” says the catalogue. 
In the president of William and Mary College of to-day, Kentuckians like Mr. 
Watterson and Dr. D. 8. Yandell will recall Col. Benjamin 8. Ewell, of Gen. Joseph 
E. Johnston’s staff during the late war. His brother, Lieut.-Gen. Richard S. Ewell, 
is buried near Nashville. For forty years President Ewell has identified himself 
with the venerable institution which now languishes. Declining professorships in 
other institutions, he adheres to the sacred charge placed in his hands years ago. 
To him I am indebted for many interesting historical facts connected with the polit- 
ical and social development of Virginia. In his companionship I looked at the rare 
documents showing the interest of the only Stuart, while on the English throne, in 
the fortunes of William and Mary College, who reigned after the succession of King 
Williamrand Queen Mary, after whom William and Mary College and Williamsburg 
werenamed. For the ‘‘Good Queen Anne,” so legend says, loved her ‘‘ royal college,” 
and certainly she gave abundant evidence that she felt no bitterness because the 
“ancient colony and dominion of Virginia” had joyfully accepted the fruits of the 
revolution of 1688, among them being the dethronement of her royal father, King 
James the Second. With this venerable preceptor of students, some of whom have 
earned national reputation, and many others locat distinction in many States, I re- 
viewed the remaining monuments of the past, in which Williamsburg is still rich, 
despite the aggressions of time and the destruction of war. In the campus of the 
college stands the monument erected to Lord Botetourt, most loved of the royal 
governors, erected by the Colonial Assembly in 1773, after his death. A rollicking, 
boyish figure is that of his Excellency, who drove his coach and six white horses 
across the Palace Green fronting his royal residence, Then Virginians were more 
loyal to the representative of the King of England than two or three years later, 
when Patrick Henry uttered his defiance of George III, and Jefferson said, ‘resistance 
to tyrants is obedience to God.” 
F. H. ALFRIEND. 
INFLUENCE OF PRESIDENT DEW. 
One of the most influential professors at the College of William and 
Mary during the present century was Thomas Roderick Dew (1802-1846). 
He was a graduate of the institution and, in 1827, at the age of twenty- 
three, became professor of political economy, history, and metaphysics. 
A copy of the laws and regulations of the College of William and Mary, 
passed and published in 1830, shows that Professor Dew then held the 
“professorship of political law,” with a salary of $1,000. His duties were 
defined as follows: he was to deliver lectures on natural and national 
law, political economy, metaphysics, government, and history. Thetext- 
book on natural and national law was to be Vattel, with reference to
-P-A-G-E-63
THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. DD 
Rutherforth’s Institutes ; in political economy, Sinith’s Wealth of Na- 
tions; in metaphysics, Browne abridged ; Locke on Government, and 
Rousseau’s Social Contract. Lectures were required at least three times 
a week upon each subject. 
In 1836 Professor Dew was made president of the college, and held 
that office until his death in Paris in 1846. He was to the College of 
William and Mary what Professor Cooper was to the College of South 
Carolina—a teacher whose doctrines entered into the political life of the 
southern people. In 1829 he published his Lectures on the Restrictive 
System in economics, which is thought to have had great weight in 
shaping the tariff laws of 1832. He was also a scientific advocate of 
slavery, and represented the political views of Calhoun. John Quincy 
Adams regarded Dew’s argument on domestic slavery (1833) as inaugu- 
rating a new era in the history of this country.. It is said to have pre- 
vented emancipation in Virginia. 
Professor Dew gave the most thorough and comprehensive course on 
history of which the writer has found any record during this early 
. period. When most colleges were teaching the subject merely by text- 
books and chiefly along classical lines of study, this man was lecturing 
systematically to his classes upon the Laws, Customs, Manners, and 
Institutions of the Ancient and Modern Nations. A published digest 
of Dew’s lectures has been examined by the writer with great interest. 
While making no professions to originality of research, the lectures were 
clearly a practical application of the lessons of all past history to the 
political needs of American youth. As the title of the published digest 
would indicate, Professor Dew laid chief stress upon laws, manners, 
customs, and institutions. 
The man was well read: in the best historical literature of his time. 
The results of French, German, and English scholarship in the field of 
classical history were familiar to the lecturer, and his observations are 
highly suggestive of parallels between ancient and modern politics. He 
specializes somewhat upon the feudal system, chivalry, the rise of the 
ecclesiastical system, the growth of cities, progress of royal power, stand- 
ing armies, balance of power, the Reformation, the English constitution, 
and the French Revolution. While the Socratic method of question 
and answer is conspicuous in the early part of his syllabus, which was 
evidently intended for younger students, the topical method of treat- 
ment predominates throughout the greater part of the digest. No un- 
prejudiced student can examine this work without coming to the con- 
viction, that the author, in his use of the scholastic method of treating 
history in distinct theses, in well-rounded periods and compact sen- , 
tences, knew precisely what he was about and lectured in such a way 
that students could catch his points. For the ground which it professes 
to cover, this digest embodies a remarkable collection of notes for lect- 
ures and dictations. It would be very difficult to match them anywhere 
in this country in the period from 1827 to 1846. It appears that the

digest was first privately printed during the lifetime of the professor 
for the use of his class, and was used as a companion book in his lect- 
ure courses for the purpose of diminishing the labor of taking notes.! 
THE GENERAL PLAN OF INSTRUCTION IN 1830. 
The work of the college appears to have been disposed in depart- 
ments or groups, rather than arranged in a continuous and required 
curriculum. There were the departments of (1) the ancient languages; 
(2) the modern languages ; (3) the sciences. In the latter department 
there were four Junior and four Senior classes, and the Law class. 
There was the Junior Moral class, embracing rhetoric, belles-lettres, 
logic, ethics, philosophy, &c.; the Junior Mathematical, extending as 
far as solid geometry, plane trigouometry, mensuration, and surveying; 
the Junior Political, embracing civil history, ancient and modern, occu- 
pying the first half of the course, and the law of nature and nations 
and the science of government, occupying the second half. Tho four 
Senior classes were the Senior Moral, the Senior Mathematical, the 
Senior Political, end the Natural Philosophical, which carried the stu- 
dents into very aévanced work for those times. A certain number of 
these class courses was required for the degree of bachelor of arts, and 
certain courses, é. g., history, were elective. There was enough class 
work offered to occupy three years, but a student could secure a degree 
in two years. The law course was quite distinct from any hitherto men- 
tioned: it embraced lectures: upon the law as it existed in Virginia, 
upon police, or administration, the history and principles of the consti- 
tutions of the United States and of Virginia. Blackstone’s Commen- 
taries and Madison’s Reports were the text-books in law. The method 
of instruction in law, history, and political science was by lectures, 
combined with “recitations from appropriate text-books.” 
CAUSES OF THE DECLINE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. 
At the outbreak of the American Revolution William and Mary Col- 
lege is said to have been the richest college in the country. The insti-   
1 Professor Dew’s Digest of the Laws, Customs, Manners, and Institutions of the Ancient

gentleman, a graduate of the college, and a scholar. His amiable disposition, fine 
talents, tact at management, great zeal, and unwearied assiduity, were the means 
of raising the college to as great prosperity as perhaps had ever been its lot at any 
time since its first establishment, notwithstanding many opposing difficulties. To 
this we must make one exception, viz, as to the classical and mathematical depart- 
ments, under some of the old and ripe scholars from England before the Revolution.” 
De Bow, in his Industrial Resources of the Southern States, iii, 454, touches another 
side of President Dew’s influence, when he says that his “able essay on the institution 
of slavery entitles him to the lasting gratitudo of the whole South.” The future his- 
torian will need to study the teaching and preaching, the political philosophy and 
the sociology of the South, before he can understand De Bow’s honest opinion.

THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. 57 
tution, during that struggle, lost its most important sources of revenue 
by (1) the depreciation of paper money, which wasted its income from 
endowments and scholarships; (2) the diversion of English endowment 
funds, notably the Boyle trust, into English channels ; (3) the abolition 
of the tobacco tax once levied upon Maryland and Virginia in the in- 
terest of the college; (4) the cession to the United States of Virginia’s 
claims to Western lands. 
This last was, perhaps, the most serious loss of all those enumerated ; 
for, by reason of the controlling position of the college in the agrarian 
affairs of Virginia, the instifution would have profited enormously by 
the survey and organization of that vast western domain, out of which 
not only States and Territories have been carved, but State universi- 
ties, agricultural colleges, and thousands of common schools have been 
created. 
There was one economic gain to the college by the Revolution. The 
palace lands adjoining Williamsburg were vested in the institution, and 
certain other property not required for public uses was bestowed upon 
William and Mary.’ Madison, writing in 1784, said that the value of 
the lands given to the college and lying about Williamsburg was esti- 
mated at £10,000. This was doubtless an over-estimate. 
The greatest loss which the College of. William and Mary ever sus- 
tained was the loss of the capital of Virginia. When, in 1779, in fear 
of British invasion of the Yorktown peninsula, it was resolved, upon 
Jefferson’s motion, to remove the political centre of the State from Will- 
iamsburg to Richmond, the very nerve of the royal old college was cut. 
The political,and social support which would have sustained the insti- 
tution, in spite of its revolutionary losses, was now destined to fall 
away. The connection between college and capital was broken. Hence- 
forth the college was compelled to live upon its history and upon its 
reputation as a church institution. 
A fine opportunity for a complete transformation of the colonial col- 
lege into a State university was lost when Jefferson’s first educational 
project failed. In 1779, the very year of the transfer of the capital to 
Richmond, Jefferson reported a bill in favor of raising William and 
Mary to a higher plane. The bill failed, because the ecclesiastical idea 
of the colonial college was not in harmony with the republican spirit     
1 President Benjamin S. Ewell, in his J?emarks before the Committee on Education and 
Labor, of the House of Representatives, January 24, 1872, and in his Report and Address 
to the Board of Visitors of the college, at their convocation in Richmond, April 18, 
1879, has fully discussed the economic causes leading to the decline of William and 
Mary in the last century. ‘In 1786 its entire capital in money was but $2,503.66.” 
Its other property, besides building and academic equipment, was in unproductive 
Jands lying in King William and Sussex Counties, with a small tract in Nottoway. 
From this economie plight the college was gradually raised to ‘‘a good degree of 
prosperity ” through the efforts of Bishop Madison. Various applications were made 
in vain to Congress, the last in 1854, for reimbursement for revolutionary losses.

of the times. The Presbyterians and other denominations represented 
in that complex house of Virginia burgesses could not vote public money 
for an Episcopalian establishment, however noble and worthy; but upon 
such an institutional compromise as that which Jefferson finally pro- 
posed they could all unite. Non-sectarianism was one of the deepest 
foundations in the political establishment of the highest education in 
Virginia. : _ 
Jefferson and the Virginians were perfectly right in their educational 
policy. In harmony with the needs of the State, they developed the 
largest and freest idea of a university which this country had hitherto 
known. The political, social, and economic energy which would have 
revitalized old William and Mary, had she become a secular institution, 
was drawn off to the new university. The birthright of the oldest and 
best college in the South was lost when the University of Virginia was 
inaugurated. With all honor to Jefferson for his sound ideas respect- 
ing education, one cannot help regretting that his own home had not 
been in Richmond rather fhan at Monticello. In the former case, he 
would perhaps have founded, in the metropolis of Virginia and ,of the 
South, an. institution embodying all the excellence of the old college 
and of the new university. The idea of a college-capital would have 
been historically transformed into a university-capital. The higher 
education would have continued to flourish in the centre of politics, 
society, business, in the very heart of church and state, as the College 
of William and Mary had flourished in Williamsburg for three quarters 
of a century. 
PROPOSED REMOVAL TO RICHMOND IN 1824. 
Naturally the friends of the old college did not look with favor upon 
the new university project. Joseph C. Cabell, writing from Richmond to 
Jefferson, December 24, 1818, significantly says: ‘‘ The party hostile to 
the university come chiefly from the lower country, and are within con- 
venient distance of William and Mary. The better educated part of 
them, whilst they, their sons, connections, or friends have been edu- 
cated at William and Mary, quote Smith, the Edinburgh Review, and. 
Dugald Stewart, to prove that education should be left to individual 
enterprise.” 
In 1824 the college party made a bold move, which, if successful, 
would have defeated Jefferson’s project for a State university near Mon- 
ticello, and have forced a compromise or a consolidation of interests. 
The move was no less than a proposition to remove the College of Will- 
iam and Mary to the city of Richmond. Cabell discovered the project 
early in May. He wrote to Jefferson from Williamsburg, May 5, 1824: 
“A scheme is now in agitation at this place, the subject of which is to 
remove the College of William and Mary to the city of Richmond. All 
the professors of the college, except-+the professor of law [Judge James 
Seinple], are decidedly in favor of it. Chancellor Brown and others,
-P-A-G-E-67

of the Board of Visitors, will give it their support. * * * It will 
most unquestionably be attempted, and will be powerfully supported. 
* * * The clergy, the Federal party, the metropolis, and probably 
the faculty of medicine throughout the State, will advocate the re- 
moval. * * * The loss of the buildings here would probably be 
compensated by donations from the corporation of Richmond, or from 
the General Assembly. The capital of the college is upward of $100,000 
* * * My present opinion is decidedly opposed to the plan; because 
I know that the college would be made a rival to the university, and 
we should lose in that institution more than we should gain in the 
college.” 
Jefferson proposed to meet this move toward Richmond on the part 
of the College of William and Mary by a move equally bold. He ad- 
vised Cabell to create no obstacles, to give no alarm. Jefferson said: 
“Tet them petition for the removal; let them get the old structure com- 
pletely on wheels, and not till then put in our claim to its reception.” 
In other words, when once the question of William and Mary was sub- 
mitted to the General Assembly, he proposed to capture the entire en- 
dowment for his own university. There can be no question about this 
intention. He said to Cabell: “The $100,000 of principal which you 
say still remains to William and Mary, by its interest of $6,000, would 
give us the two deficient professors, with an annual surplus for the pur- 
chase of books.” Jefferson frankly declared his opposition to the es- 
tablishment of William and Mary in Richmond, and intimated that if 
that city pressed her claims to the old college she would create such 
jealocsy in the midland counties as to res her own position as the 
seat of government. 
The people of Richmond were servetl’ in favor of the proposed re- 
moval, and it would have been a fortunate thing for that city, for the 
college, for the university, and for the State at large, if all interests 
could have been united. It was a crisis in the history of William and 
Mary. Her best friends were nearly all agreed that Richmond would 
prove her salvation. On the 24th of ' November, 1824, the convocation 
of visitors and governors voted the following resolutions : 
1. That it is expedient to apply to the legislature of Virginia to au- 
thorize the visitors to change the site of the College of William and 
Mary, with a view to a more extended diffusion of the benefits of the in- 
stitution. 
2. That the faculty of the college be instructed to prepare and to 
present to the General Assembly a memorial for the purpose of procur- 
ing the passage of a law in conformity with the above resolution. 
JEFFERSON'S RIVAL POLICY. 
Cabell wrote to Jefferson, December 17, 1824: ‘The hostile party in 
Richmond and the college aim decidedly ata great institution connected 
with a medical school.” Jefferson recognized the full significance of
-P-A-G-E-68
  
60 CIRCULARS OF INFORMATION FOR 1887. 
the Richmond idea. He knew well that it meant the ultimate defeat of 
his own cherished. project. He replied to Cabell, December 22, 1824: 
“The proposition to remove William and Mary College to Richmond, 
with its present funds, and to add to it a medical school, is nothing more 
nor less than to remove the university also to that place; because, if 
both remain, there will not be students enough to make either worthy 
the acceptance of men of the first order of science. They must each 
fall down to the level of our present academies, under the direction of 
common teachers, and our state of education must stand exactly where 
it now is. Few of the States have been able to maintain one university, 
none two.” : 
Jefferson early discovered the great principles of centralization in the 
higher education and decentralization in common schools, principles 
which have been so ably advocated in these moder. days by President 
Andrew D. White, of Cornell, a distinguished champion of State 
universities.| Finding that it was impossible to capture the endowment 
‘of William and Mary for the University of Virginia, Jetierson and Ca- 
bell agreed upon a plan still better suited for the strengthening of their 
own great project. They proposed to conquer their rivals by a division 
of the resources of William and Mary among a considerable number of 
college districts for the endowment of preparatory institutions, which 
should be tributary to the central University of Virginia. Jefferson 
wisely suggested the possibility of utilizing the local sentiment of rival 
towns and of building up existing academies into colleges at the ex- 
pense of William and Mary. He mentioned Williamsburg, Richmond, 
Fredericksburg, Hampden-Sidney, Lynchburg, Lexington, Staunton, 
Winchester, etc. ‘ Thus,” he said, “of William and Mary, you will 
make ten colleges, each as useful as she ever was, leaving one in Will- 
iamsburg itself, placing as good a one within a day’s ride of every 
man in the State, and get our whole scheme of education completely 
established.” 
This plan for decentralization in secondary education and centraliza- 
tion in the higher education was simply a reversion to Jefferson’s origi- 
nal educational policy, reported to the Virginia legislature as early as 
1779. Cabell recognized the wisdom of Jefferson’s Scheme for the de- 
feat of his rivals, and urged him to prepare a bill as a possible substitute 
for the plan of removing the college to Richmond. “ You alone,” said 
Cabell January 16, 1825, “can prepare a bill that will enable us to van- 
quish the host opposed tous. * * * Isend you a printed copy of 
your bill for public instruction, to enable you to execute the draft with 
less trouble. Let the funds be equally divided among the districts, 
whatever they may be. * * * I think the representatives will pause 
before they give away the rights and interests of their constituents. 
Great excitement prevails.” Immediately upon receipt of this letter

the sage of Monticello, now in his eighty-second year, proceeded to draft 
the required bill, which is given in full in the correspondence between 
Jefferson and Cabell, the chief source of information respecting this 
educational crisis in the history of Virginia. 
TRIUMPH OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
The question of the removal of William and Mary to Richmond was 
adversely decided by the General Assembly, through the personal in- 
fluence of Cabell, before any necessity arose for introducing Jefferson’s 
bill, which would surely have routed all opposition. Cabeil published 
an article in the Constitutional Whig and in the Enquirer, embodying 
his views and Jefferson’s. His article carried the day.. In explanation 
of this course, Cabell wrote to Jefferson February 3, 1825: “TI saw the 
gathering necessity of setting up the colleges against the Richmond 
party, and it was requisite to show your former plans, and our efforts 
to sustain them.” Again, on the 7th of February, Cabell writes: “I 
am happy to inform you that our efforts have eventuated in success, 
and that the college party have been defeated in the House of Delegates 
by a majority of 24. * * * My friends assure me that the essay 
under the signature of ‘A friend of science,’ with the extracts from 
your letter and bill, had all the effect I could possibly desire. It broke 
the ranks of the opposition completely.” Thus by these two masterly 
politicians, Cabell and Jefferson, the Richmond cause of William and 
-Mary was defeated. 
DESTRUCTION OF WILLIAM AND MARY COLLEGE IN THE CIVIL WAR. 
When the civil war broke out, it was but natural that the professors 
and students of a thoroughly southern institution should follow the 
fortunes of their own section of the country. The intensity of feeling 
in those times is seen in the fact that ninety per cent. of the youth then 
pursuing a course of study at the college joined the Confederate Army. 
In the war of the American Revolution only fifty per cent. of the stu- 
dents from William and Mary took arms for the cause of independence. 
Except for a short interval, during the Yorktown campaign against 
Cornwallis, the old college continued its courses of instruction ; but in 
1861 the outbreak of war at its very doors made further scholastic work 
impossible. Everybody took arms. As men felt in that great crisis of 
the republic, so they fought. 
The story of the destruction of William and Mary College shall be 
told in an extract from a government document of the United States: 
‘¢The peninsula formed by the James and York Rivers was debatable 
ground, occupied alternately by the contending forces. Williamsburg, 
the site of William and Mary, is its strategic point, the key of the mili- 
tary position, and terriffic battles were fought for its possession. In 
September, 1862, Williamsburg was held by a detachment of the United

States Army, but on the 9th of that month the place was attacked and 
occupied by a force of Confederate cavalry, who held the city until 11 
o'clock of that day. Upon the evacuation by the rebel cavalry and the 
return of our troops, a body of stragglers from the United States forces, 
drunken, disorderly, and insubordinate, fired and destroyed the college 
building, with the library, apparatus, furniture, and other property 
therein belonging to theinstitution. Afterward, during the War, other 
houses and property of the college and connected therewith were de- 
stroyed by Union soldiers.” 
No less'than five favorable reports’ have been made, recommending 
congressional relief to William and Mary College for losses sustained 
as above described. President Ewell appeared before the Committee 
of Education and Labor at various times, advocating his worthy cause 
in the most judicious language. One of the notable speeches in support 
of the measure was made in 1876 by a northern Senator. 
NORTHERN TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM AND MARY. 
Hon. George F. Hoar, Senator from Massachusetts, in a speech ad- 
vocating congressional relief to the College of William and Mary, said: 
“To spare, and if possible to protect, institutions of learning, is an 
obligation which the most civilized nations impose on themselves, 
Whenever, by accident or design, these institutions have been injured 
in war, such governments desire, if possible, to make reparation. His- 
tory contains many conspicuous and interesting examples of this gen-. 
erous recognition. * * * In her bloodiest and angriest civil strifes, 
all factions in England have revered her institutions of learning. Her 
schools and colleges, whatever side they may have taken in civil war, 
have enjoyed immunity from its injuries, when even her stately and 
venerable cathedrals have not been spared. Think what permanence | 
these schools enjoy, shielded from the storms of war by the beneficent 
principle we invoke. Wherever civilization exists, wherever men are 
humane and Christian, the college or the school, wisely founded, shall 
endure. I purchased:at Eton, a few years since, a little book contain- 
ing the history of the ten great schools of England. I was struck, in 
looking over it, to see the dates of their endowment: Eton, in 1440; Win- 
chester, 1560; St. Paul’s, 1509; Merchant Taylors’, 1560; Charter House, 
1641; Harrow, 1571; Rugby, 1567; Shrewsbury, 1549; Christ’s, 1522; 
while the origin of Oxford and Cambridge is lost in the darkness of 
antiquity. .

At Winchester William of Wykeham founded, in 1380, a school which 
still stands and has remained through six dynasties. Plantagenet, Lan-

ham in his lifetime planned and built the scholars of Winchester are 
still governed by the statutes which he framed. 
“You will scarcely find an instance, in England or America, where a

“But William and Mary has also her own peculiar claim on our re- 
gard. The great principles on which the rights of man depend, which 
inspired the statesmen of Virginia of the period of the Revolution, are 
the fruits of her teaching. The name of Washington, to whose genius 
in war and to whose influence in peace we owe the vindication of our 
liberties and the successful inauguration of our Constitution, is insep- 
arably connected with William and Mary. She gave him his first com- 
mission in his youth; he gave to her his last public service in his age. 
Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, who announced the 
great law of equality and human rights, in whose light our Constitution 
is at last and forever to be interpreted, drank his inspiration at her 
fountain. Marshall, without whose luminous and far-sighted exposition 
our Constitution could hardly have been put into successful operation, 
who imbedded forever in our constitutional law the great doctrines on 
which the measures that saved the Union are based, was a son of Will- 
iam and Mary. By the cession of the great Northwestern Territory, 
largely due to the efforts of one of her illustrious sons, she lust a great 
part of her revenues. 
“Next to Harvard she is the oldest of American colleges. The gift 
of the famous Robert Boyle was held by her for many years, on con- 
dition of an annual payment of £90 to Harvard. Boyle was the friend 
of many of the early friends and benefactors of Harvard, and a cor- 
respondent of one of its first presidents. Each of these two semina- 
ries, in its own part of the country, kindled and kept alive the sacred 
fire of liberty. In 1748, the year Jefferson was born, Samuel Adams 
maintained, on taking his degree of master of arts at Harvard, the af- 
firmative of the thesis, whether it be lawful to resist the supreme mag- 
istrate, if the Commonwealth cannot otherwise be preserved. In this 
hour of the calamity of her sister college 1 am glad to believe that Har- 
vard does not forget the ancient tie. The mother of the Otises and 
Adamses would gladly extend her right hand to the mother of Jeffer- 
son and Marshall,

“Tf civil strife or foreign war shall ever again disturb our peace, 
every college in the land will be safer if Congress shall to-day make 
this solemn recognition of the rule we invoke. To deny it is to deny to 
the college of Washington the justice he did to Princeton. To deny 
it is to deny to Virginia the generous treatment which Connecticut re- 
ceived from Tryon, Philadelphia from Cooke, and William and Mary 
herself from Louis XVI! of France. The hallowed associations which 
surround this college prevent this case from being a precedent for any 
other. Ifyou had injured it, you surely would have restored Mount 
Vernon; you had better honor Washi:gton by .restoring ‘the living 
fountain of learning whose service was the pleasure of his last years, 
than by any useless and empty act of worship or respect toward his 
sepulchre. 
“No other college in the country can occupy the same position. By 
the fortune of war that sacred institution, which has conferred on the 
country a hundredfold more benefit than any other institution or col- 
lege in the South, has become a sufferer. I desire to hold out the olive 
branch to the people of Virginia, to the people of the South, to show 
them that we will join them in rebuilding the sacred place laid waste 
by the fortunes of war.” 
PRESENT CONDITION OF WILLIAM AND MARY COLLEGE. 
Notwithstanding the many and earnest; appeals for the relief of 
William and Mary, in spite of the acknowledged fact that the destruc. 
tion of its property was the wanton act of undisciplined soldiery, an act 
contrary to the usages of war, which, even in the dark ages, spared 
churches and schools, no measure of relief for the College of William 
and Mary has ever been passed by the Congress of these United 
States. The Treasury is bursting with silver, and the annual surplus 
of $100,000,000 is such a burden to the people that they cannot unload 
it. But still we hear the cry of “economy.” If it were only exercised 
where it is really needed, there would be reason in the cry. The coun- 
try is allowed to stagger under tariff laws that are too heavy to bear. 
The public land of the nation has been recklessly wasted; itis held by 
railroad corporations, in some instances, under false pretences; it is 
falling into the hands of foreign syndicates and’ English landlords ; it 
is actually stolen to the extent of millions of acres, as shown by the 
latest reports of the Land Office. All this prodigality of the nationay 
substance is suffered by Congress, but for the great cause of EDUCA- 
TION, upon which the very salus publica of the American people depends, 
amid growing ignorance, socialism, and anarchy, for the cause of Light 
where darkness is increasing, there is only pitiful economy.

  THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. . 65 
An institution which was once a beacon of learning and of political 
intelligence, not alone for Virginia but for the whole South and for the 
country at large, has been sufiered to decline by a uation which owes 
it an actual although paltry debt of $70,000. Noble efforts have been 
made by individuals in the worth and at the South to sustain the Col- 
lege of William and Mary. Even the Archbishop of Canterbury and 
other Englishmen lent their aid to kindle anew the torch of education at 
Williamsburg. Rebuffed by Congress, which seemed to take less in 
terest in the cause of perpetuating sound learning than did originally 
the mercantile companies which founded Virginia and Massachusetts, 
the president of old William and Mary, Dr. Benjamin S. Ewell, went 
forth among the people to beg for his worthy cause. He even bore a 
certificate signed by a Union general, who won the battle of Gettysburg. 
General Meade was the author of the following letter: 
“Tam satisfied, on examination of the facts of the case, that the de- 
struction of the buildings of William and Mary College by our troops 
was not only unnecessary and unauthorized, but was one of those de- 
plorable acts of useless destruction which occur in all wars. 
“Tn this view, and believing that its reconstruction, under the direc- 
tion and superintendence of Professor Benj. 8. Ewell, will tend to 
cement and strengthen the bonds of Union principles, I take great pleas- 
ure in recommending the appeal of Professor Ewell to all those who have 
the ineans and the disposition to assist him in the good work in which 
he is engaged.” 
Too often the higher education in America is forced to live by veg- 
ging. In the case of William and Mary not even the license to beg, 
given by the hero of Gettysburg, was sufficient to command public at- 
tention. A few thousand dollars were subscribed by benevolent, whoile- 
souled people in New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, 
Washington, and elsewhere ; but most generous of all gifts were those 
from Virginia, for there, in the decade following the War, men and 
women were less able to give to colléges aud universities than they 
are now. Enough money was contributed to restore the main building 
of William and Mary and to organize the faculty anew, with depart- 
ments of Latin, Greek, mathematics, modern languages, natural science, 
philosophy, and belles-lettres. But the annual expenses exceeded the 
annual income. Old endowments had been lost; new ones proved in- 
adequate. At last the professors were all dismissed, because their sal- 
aries could not be paid. Consequently students disappeared. The 
president alone remained at his post. During one year he had one 
student, but even he has gone. The president remains still at the col- 
lege. At the opening of every academic year, in October, he causes the 
chapel bell to be rung. Does it ring for the living, or does it toll for 
the dead? Is it the clang of a bell of warning to all friends of the 
higher education, a bell buoyed over a sunken rock upon the dangerous 
coast of popular ignorance and national neglect? or is it a summons to

men in every State and at the nation’s Capitol to do their duty in the 
cause of higher education, to be “‘ Wise and True and Just,” as were the 
founders who gave that ancient motto to the College of William and 
Mary? : 
QUESTION OF REMOVAL: ALEXANDRIA OR RICHMOND. 
The College of William and Mary has still a double chance for life 
in Virginia. By removal to Alexandria, into close proximity with the 
theolegical seminary, it would receive strength and encouragement from 
the Episcopalian Church, whose centre of ecclesiastical training in Vir- 
ginia is in the old city on the Potomac, within easy reach of Washing- 
ton and on the main line of travel between the North and the South. 
1t would escape all the present disadvantages of isolation, munieipal de- 
eay, reputed unhealthiness of environment, and would undoubtedly take 
a fresh departure as an ecclesiastical institution, without any serious 
break in the continuity of its traditions. 
The site of the college was changed in its earliest )ears from Towns- 
end@’s Point, on York River, just above Yorktown, where it was first 
planted by charter. This document provided that “If, by reason of un- 
wholesomeness or any other cause, the said place shall not be approved 
of,” the site might be changed “ wheresoever else the General Assembly 
of our Colony of Virginia, or the major part of them, shall think fit, 
within the bounds of the aforesaid Colony, to continue for all times 
coming.” 
By a formal vote of the Board of Visitors and Trustees, in 1824, the 
question of removal from Williamsburg to Richmond was submitted to 
the authority of the General Assembly. If the case could be legally 
referred to that body in that instance, it could be now referred again 
with respect to Alexandria or any other place. Upon application by 
the existing corporation to the General Assembly of Virginia, any re- 
quired alteration or emendation of its charter could be easily secured, 
in the present era of good feeling as regards higher education. 
Perhaps a still better course than removal to Alexandria would be 
to move again upon Richmond. There would be little or no opposition 
now, when it is clearly seen that it is a question of life or death with 
the oldest college in the South. Loyalty to higher education, munici- 
pal interests, and the best social influences of Richmond and Virginia, 
to say nothing of the outside world, would be enlisted in behalf of this 
venerable and historic institution. If it should begin life anew with 
nothing but a hired house or one professor in a lawyer’s office, it would 
command public sympathy and support. It would draw to itself the 
most vital of all currents—youth, immortal youth. Students invigorate 
a college, awaken professors, delight college presidents and boards of 
trustees, who, by this very student pressure, are emboldened to ask 
capitalists to stand and deliver. The pronounced success of Richmond

College, a flourishing Baptist institution, demonstrates the possibilities 
of this municipal environment for an meacition of learning. 
William and Mary College should have changed its base immedi- 
ately after the civil war from Williamsburg to Richmond. It should 
have utilized the historic prestige of the capital of the Old and New 
South. In spite of all legal quibbles, the legislature could have as 
easily modified the geographical provision of the charter as the Board 
of Visitors changed the chancellorship from the Bishop. of London to 
George Washington after the war of the American Revolution. Even 
now this change of base from Williamsburg to Richmond isa grand 
possibility of life for the old College of William and Mary. Against 
manifest fate, against isolation, poverty, and desertion, President Ewell 
and no man can struggle with success. But with the favoring current 
of history and politics, of publie opinion and common sense, it is pos- 
sible for even one individual to guide an institution, or an idea, tosome 
worthy end. 
Whatever may be the destiny of the College of William and Mary, 
her influence upon higher education in Virginia and throughout the 
South can never be lost. 
“She cannot die! Amid the flame, 
Which like a death-shroud binds her in its fold, 
Her spirit walks serene in deathless fame, 
Like to the martyred Israelites of old. | 
The fire but purifies the virgin gold, 
Frees the rough ore, and burns away the rust. 
Then, ere the burnished metal waxes cold, 
With reverent hearts her children must 
Renew her ancient impress, ‘WISE AND TRUE AND JuST.’”! 
PRACTICAL LESSONS FROM THE HISTORY OF WILLIAM AND MARY. 
It is impossible to study the past experience of institutions of learn- 
ing without deriving useful lessons for the present.” Among the ideas 
suggested by the history of William and Mary College are the following: 
(1) like Harvard College, it was originally a State institution, supported 
by government appropriations and by taxation, as well as by private   
1 From the. poem of St. George Tucker, read February 19, 1859, on the occasion of 
the 166th anniversary of the founding of William and Mary College, a few days after 
the conflagration which destroyed the college buildings. See Southern Literary Mes- 
senger, March, 1859, p. 238. This magazine contains three excellent articles on Will- 
iam and Mary College: (1) March, 1855, vol. 21, No. 3; (2) October, 1856, vol. 23, 
No. 4; (3) March, 1859, vol. 28, No. 3. 
The College of William and Mary has been destroyed by fire, either wholly or in 
part, four different times: (1) in 1705; (2) in 1781, by the French; (3) in 1859, when 
it was restored within a year’s time; (4) in 1862, substantially restored in 1869 by pri- 
vate aid. The damages wantonly caused by Union soldiers in our late civil war have 
never been settled by the United States, although the French Government, more than 
a century ago, set us a memorable example by immediate compensation for damages 
| accidentally caused by their troops during the occupation of Williamsburg.

philanthropy ; (2) like Harvard again, it was founded in the interest of 
the church and of liberal education ; (3) it was early associated with the 
best political, religious, aud social forces of Virginia in a municipal 
environment; (4) the college-capital flourished so long as Williamsburg 
remained the political and social centre of Virginia; (5) when the capi- 
tal of the State was removed to Richmond, the life current of the col- 
lege became feeble, for it ceased practically to be a State institution, 
and remained only a church institution in a decaying borough, whose 
vitality had fled; (6) the survival of its ecclesiastical character in a 
State where dissenting interests were in the majority, actually prevented 
the college from becoming the University of Virginia, according to the 
original plan of Jefferson; (7) non-sectarianism was the corner-stone of 
that rival State institution, which, founded in a rural environment on the 
outskirts of Charlottesville within sight of Monticello, speedily rose above 
old William and Mary College, prevented its removal to a better mu- 
nicipal vantage-ground in Richmond, and drew away its’ strength and 
prestige ;! (8) persistent refusal to remove to a more healthful and 
favorable municipal environment, after the disasters of the civil war, 
when there was everything to gain and comparatively nothing to lose, 
was a mistake second only to the defeat of the first project for removal 
to Richmond in 1821; (9) the most practical of all lessons to be derived 
from the history of William and Mary is the possible renaissance, in the 
educational policy of our States, of the original Williamsburg idea of a 
college-capital, or at least of higher education, in a municipal rather 
than in a rural, or even suburban, environment; and (10) the revival 
of that close connection between education and good citizenship which 
made the College of William and Mary a seminary of statesmen. The 
last two ideas the writer proposes now to consider, more specifically with 
reference to the greatest educational need of our time—the application of 
historical and political science to American politics. 
  THE HIGHER EDUCATION IS DEMOCRATIC AND REPRESENTATIVE. 
The proposition that this country stands in need of the practical ap- 
plication of the lessons of history and politival science to the solution 
of great problems in administrative reform—municipal, State, and na- 
, tional, in tariff reform, in agrarian reform, in social reform, in labor re- 
form, and in the repression of anarchy and crime, will hardly be denied 
by any thoughtful citizen. Reflection will also convince fair-minded     
1The attraction of the new university for Virginia youth, at an early period, is 
- indicated by an article which the writer recently noted in the New York Times, circa 
December 20, 1886, on ‘‘A statesman of the past,” the Hon. Alexander H. H. Stuart, 
of Staunton, Va., the trusted friend of Webster and Clay. Mr. Stuart is now about 
eighty years of age. In his day he has had as much influence upon Virginia politics 
as ever Tilden or Seward or Marcy enjoyed in the State of New York. In an inter- 
view with a visitor Mr. Stuart related the fact that, sixty years or more ago, he was 
a student at William and Mary College, but that he graduated in the University of Vir- 
ginia, This one case shows how the educational tide was turning.

men that, in order to apply such lessons to politics, economics, and 
society, there must be proper avenues of influence, proceeding pri- 
marily from the people and leading through institutions of learning to 
the very issues in question. In a republic like ours, no reforms are pos- 
sible which are not demanded by public opinion and common sense. 
When these great forces begin to move in society and in the state, some- 
thing greater than a mouse is likely to come forth from the mountain. 
It is certainly a reasonable and democratic idea that the highest edu- 
cational privileges of a state should be brought within the reach of 
representatives of the common people. Thomas Jefferson was a farmer’s 
son, trained in Virginia schools for the College of William and Mary, 
and by that institution for the governorship of Virginia, for the presi- 
dency of the United States, and for the founding of the University of 
Virginia, where the sons of that State were trained even better than 
were their sires. In the entire United States there is to-day no institu- 
tion more democratic than the University of Virginia, either in its stu- 
dent representation:or mode of government. The sons of Virginia 
farmers and planters are educated there without the payment of a dol- 
lar for tuition. The higher education is as free as air. The university 
receives all who are able to come, and allows them to stay as long as 
they can do so with profit to themselves ; but-+the university reserves 
its honors for the men who can pass its examinations. Ability and 
character are the sole standards of promotion in the higher education, 
and that is precisely what this country needs in its public servants. 
The people endeavor by their votes to secure the best man for Presi- 
dent, and sometimes they succeed. While all privileges and all offices 
are and ought to be accessible to the people, it is well understood that 
this is a representative government, and that there is some sense in 
preferring one man to another, else we should ali raffle for the presi- 
dency and cast lots for the offices in his gift. In other words, fitness is 
the true principle in the choice of popular representatives for office or 
for honors in the higher education. It is true even in polities that many 
are called but few are chosen. 
The representative principle is'as valid in the higher education a’ it 
is in the higher walks of politics. While all the sons and daughters of 
the people should enjoy common school privileges, as all men enjoy the 
right of suffrage, it does not follow that all should receive a university 
education at tle people’s expense. One might as well expect that all 
voters should be sent to Congress. There must be in the higher edu- 
cation, as in politics, some principle of natural selection and a survival 
of the fittest. cite 
The State universities of this country are open to the sons of the 
people in the freest, fairest way. Like the University of Virginia, the 
University of Michigan,! and the University of California, nearly all State

universities afford free tuition to students dwelling within the borders 
of their respective States who are able and willing to profit by the 
higher education. Some of the State universities, for example, that of 
North Carolina, pursue a more economical plan, and accord free tuition 
to representative students, appointed for merit from each county or 
election district. Until 1876, this was the method of the University of 
Virginia, the faculty of which annually selected for merit one student 
from each of the fifty senatorial districts in that State. These ap- 
pointees alone enjoyed free tuition. The State University of Alabama 
still receives, free of charge, one student from each county. There isa 
manifest tendency, in some parts of the South, to return to this more 
economic and discriminating system, for the sake of increasing univer- * 
sity revenues by money arising from tuition. In general, it might be 
said that this method fs not only good economy, but good educational 
policy, for the higher education is always better appreciated when it is 
paid for, whether by money, merit, honorable service, or some quid pro 
quo. <A university career should not be beyond the reach of the poor, 
but it should be an honor rather than a charity, a recognition of ability 
rather than of poverty. 
THE MERIT SYSTEM IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION OF NEW YORK. 
The most healthful, suggestive, and fully developed method of con- 
necting university life with the people is that now in vogue in the piv- 
otal State of American politics, the State of New York, where Cornell 
University, in return for the agricultural college land grant, affords 
free tuition to one student each year from each Assembly district, who 
is appointed for merit by the county commissioners of education. This 
method of appointment makes the higher education a prize and an 
honor, both to the successful student and to the high school or academy 
which trained him. It strengthens the secondary schools by the natu- 
ral effect of competition} and it recruits the university from popular 
sources, which supply all vigorous currents in the life of a state. The 
university cat, if it pleases, apply its own educational tests and send 
back deficient appointees for further preparation, or it can accept, at 
discretion, the certificates of local examiners. It has lately been rec- 
ommended by the Cornell alumni that vacant or unimproved district 
scholarships shall be filled from districts where applications are in ex- 
cess of the allowance, after the manner of appointment to State normal 
schools.?

The educational experience of the State of New York is a most valu- 
able afid suggestive guide for the regulation of schools, colleges, and 
universities within State limits. In New York a uniform standard of

THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. Cl 
excellence has been reached in the high schools and academies by a 
system of State examinations and by the award of teachers’ certificates 
by State authority. A reasonable harmony of interests among the vari- 
ous colleges and universities has been reached by an annual convoca- 
tion of their representatives, together with the principals of high schools 
and academies. 
The educational control of the State of New York is in the hands of 
a board of twenty-three regents of the so-called “ University of the 
State of New York.” It is simply an examining board, consisting of 
the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, Secretary of State, superintendent 
of public instruction, and nineteen other members chosen by the State 
legislature in the same manner as State senators, and holding office 
during the pleasure of the legislature. While a regent must be a citi- 
zen of the State of New York, he cannot be a trustee or officer of any 
college, academy, or university under the control of the board of regents. 
lts officers are a chancellor, vice-chancellor, secretary and treasurer, 
and an assistant secretary, who hold their position during the pleasure 
of their associate regents. The business of the board is conducted prin- 
cipally by means of standing committees, of which there are ten, viz: 
on Incorporations ; on the State Museum; on the State Library; on 
the Instruction of Common School Teachers; on the Distribution of the 
Literature Fund ; on Appropriations for the Purchase of Books and 
Apparatus; on the Annual Report; on the Visitation of Colleges and 
Academies; on Academic Examinations; on Printing and Legislation; 
and on Degrees. 
The present board of regents is the historical outgrowth of the orig- 
inal board of governors of King’s (now Columbia) College. ‘In 1784, 
the governors petitioned for “ an extension of the privileges of the said 
college so as to render it the mother of an university.” The practical 
organization of the board of regents dates from the year 1787, and it 
was largely the work of that master mind, Alexander Hamilton. , This 
board of regents has chartered allimportant educational institutions in 
the State of New York; it has exercised for one hundred years a wise 
and beneficent control over not only the highest educational, but the 
highest scientific interests of the State; it has preserved and published 
the historical records ; it has investigated the most intricate historical 
questions relating to the boundaries of the State; it has cared for the 
State library and State museum; it has, encouraged meteorological 
observations in connection with local institutions of learning; it has 
published in its reports an amount of special literature of unexampled 
interest in the history of state education in this country. Without an 
examination into the facts of the case, one would hardly believe the 
extent to which New York has carried her system of state control over . 
the higher, as well as over secondary and primary education within 
her limits. Her regents examine secondary schools throughout the 
State. They require annual reports from all the higher institutions of

learning. They not only give teachers’ certificates, but, under approved 
conditions, they award acalemic degrees, Indeed it was at one time 
seriously proposed by the president of Cornell University, Andrew D. 
White, to put the power of conferring degrees entirely into the hands 
of the board of regents of the University 01 the State of New York. 
THE MERIT SYSTEM AT THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY. 
Throughout the entire country, from New York to the Gulf States, from 
Virginia to California, the principle of student representation or stu- 
dent election in our higher systems of education is already recognized 
to a greater or less degree. The idea has even passed beyond State 
limits, and is now in practical operation in at least one group of three 
southern States—Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. Yo under- 
graduate students from these three States the Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity, in Baltimore, gives twenty ordinary Hopkins scholarships, yield- 
ing free tuition ($100) and tenable for three years. This university also 
gives eighteen honorary Hopkins scholarships, yielding $250 per annum 
and free tuition, “to be awarded for uncommo» merit, among the matric- 
ulated undergraduate students from each of the States above named, 
the selection to be made by the board of colleziate advisers.” ! 
The reason for discrimination in favor of meritorious undergraduate 
students from these three States is the expressed will of the founder of 
the Johns Hopkins University, who desired his trustees to “establish 
from time to time such number of free scholarships in the said univer- 
sity as may be judicious, and to distribute the said scholarships among 
such candidates from the States of Maryland, Virginia, and North Oaro- 
lina, as may be most deserving of choice, because of their character and 
intellectual promise, and to educate the young men so chosen free of 
charge.” The founder’s motive was not altogether unlike that which 
causes the University of Virginia to limit its free tuition to students 
from that State. To Johns Hopkins, the wholesale merchant, Maryland, 
Virginia, and North Carolina were simply a larger economic common- 
wealth, from which he had drawn his millions in the processes of trade 
and commercial intercourse. He wished to benefit that group of States 
which had benefited him. In no way could he have better quickened 
the highest life of that one group of American commonwealths than by 
thus providing for the higher education of their representative young 
men who were “ most deserving of choice.” ; 
The merit system in the higher education has been extended by the 
Johns Hopkins University into the District of Columbia, where two un- 
‘dergraduate scholarships, yielding free tuition, are open to resident 
candidates. At the very outset the merit system, which is the life prin- 
ciple of the university, leaped the confines of the three States above 
named, and invited a wider competition and more than national student 
representation. From the very beginning of the university the twenty 
ae 1 The Johns Hopkins University Register, 1885~'86, p. 66; of. p. 70.

  THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. 13. 
fellowships, yielding $500 a year, with free tuition, have been open to 
graduates of any other institution in this country or in foreign lands, “for 
conspicuous merit.” While very naturally the majority ef the appointees 
are graduates of collegiate institutions in the United States, there are 
repeated instances of the award of fellowships to Canadians, Europeans, 
and Japanese. By the recent institution of twenty graduate scholar- 
ships, ten to Hopkins graduates and ten to graduates of other instim- 
tions now studying in Baltimore, each scholarship yielding $200 a year, 
the merit system in university education has been still further extended 
and at the same time practically centralized in its operation. 
A fair proportion of these various university honors has been given 
to graduate students in history and political science, upon evidence 
of good work and in competition with other departments. While the 
attainment of honors is not the main motive of graduate study in a 
specific department, the merit system undoubtedly and deservedly acts 
as a powerful incentive. The success achieved by senior fellows at- 
tracts and stimulates their juniors. The original number of graduate 
students (three) in history and politics has increased tenfold. The orig- 
inal number of undergraduate students (two) in the same subjects is now 
over one hundred. Aside from the original work produced and pub- 
lished in the four volumes of Studies in Historical and Political Science, 
and six independent volumes upon special subjects, the most conspicu- 
ous result of the merit system in historical and political education is the 
promotion of doctors of philosophy from this department to professor- 
ships or good positions in other colleges and universities. Of the six 
men who in June, 1886, were awarded the doctors degree in history 
and political science, every one was almost immediately advanced to a 
still higher honor by some other institution, viz: By (1) the Massachu- 
setts Institute of Technology ; (2) the University of California; (3) Bryn 
Mawr Odllege; (4) Swarthmore College; (5) Washington High School; 
(6) Imperial College of Sapporo, Japan. Altogetlier, in this department 
there have been graduated twelve doctors of philosophy, of whom nine 
have entered upon academic careers, one is an editor, and two have 
served in the Bureau of Labor Statistics at Washington, besides teach- 
ing boys. Altogether, the Johns Hopkins University has supplied 
48 institutions with 82 instructors, who have won the doctor’s degree. 
A NATIONAL TENDENCY IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION. 
Upon a map of the United States, recently issued by the Land Office, 
the writer has caused to be ticketed, and labelled with individual names, 
the various institutions of learning which have employed the services 
of graduate students from the Johns Hopkins University. The experi- 
ment was suggested by an account which the writer once,saw in one of 
the published addresses of Andrew D. White,! ex- president of Cornell 
  Agricultural and Mechanical Education. Address before the New York “Agricult- 
ural Society, 1859, by Andrew D. White; reprinted in the Cornell University Reg- 
ister, 1871.

University—an account of a wall map in the French agricultural college 
at Guignon, which showed at a glance where all its graduates were sta- 
tioned and how they were employed. The application of this novel idea 
to the graphical illustration of what the writer is inclined to call the 
- colonial system of the Johns Hopkins University, shows to the eye that 
all along the Atlantic coast-line, from Bowdoin College in Maine to the 
Agricultural College of Florida, Baltimore instructors are as thick as 
sea-birds—thickest of all in the Middle States. From the Baltimore 
point of departure they stretch inland in two long lines, one bold and 
strong toward the Northwest, the other less conspicuous, but pushing 
into the great Southwest as surely as railway traffic. Three professo- 
rial names in California and three in Japan indicate that Baltimore in- 
fluence in the higher education has passed beyond the limits of the 
Baltimore and Ohio Railway system, which is the economic background 
of the Johns Hopkins University. 
One other fact is very noticeable upon this university map. The one 
place outside of Baltimore where Johns Hopkins men. most do congre- 
gate is the City of Washington. These men are in governmental or edu- 
cational service. Graphical statistics demonstrate the fact, which the 
writer has long been inclined to believe, that the greatest vantage 
ground of this Baltimore university is its proximity to the nation’s capi- 
tal. Baltimore, whether consciously or unconsciously, is reproducing 
the old Williamsburg ideal of a college “ with the conveniences of a 
town,” upon a somewhat enlarged scale. As the old College of William 
and Mary faced the old capito: of Virginia, with the Duke of Glouces- 
ter Street between, so the new Baltimore university faces the new Capi- 
tol of the nation, only forty-five minutes distant on the Baltimore and 
Ohio express. One could not traverse so quickly in the horse cars the 
length of Pennsylvania Avenue, from the neighborhood of Georgetown 
College to the grounds of the Capitol. 
From geographical and railway contiguity, the relations between Bal- 
timore and Washington are drawing closer every year. More and more 
are Hopkins men employed in Washington; more and more does Wash- 
ington send her students and the Government its specialists to Balti. 
more. Every year there is a better understanding of Washington and 
of its institutions on the part of university students, through the prac- 
tical teachings of public men who are invited to Baltimore to address 
the Seminary of History and Politics. It is no small privilege for 
students to hear the subject of civil service feform expounded by a 
government commissioner, or current questions of American politics 
elucidated in familiar, friendly language by a Senator of the United 
States. These are simply accomplished facts. A national university, 
without any of the dangers and impediments arising from political con- 
trol, stands midway between the North and the South, in the closest 
connection with the West, near enough to Washington to profit by 
its object lessons in polities and administration, by its libraries and
-P-A-G-E-87
  
THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. 75 
museums; and yet far enough away to escape that familiarity with 
political methods which sometimes breeds contempt or precocious imita- 
tion on the part of unripe youth. 
THE PROMOTION OF HIGHER POLITICAL EDUCATION. 
The time for a national university in Washington is either past or not 
yet come. Such an institution is not desirable in the present state of 
national politics and civic administration, nor is it needed by the coun- 
try with its present supply of universities, already pervaded not only 
by a State spirit, but by a growing national, if not a truly cosmopol- 
itan idea. What is needed, however, in all our States and in the na- 
tion’s capital is the promotion of the higher political education in practical 
ways. 
The representative or merit system in academic training should be 
made to connect not only, on the one hand, with the people, but, on the 
other, with practical polities and the civil service. Universities which 
recognize meritorious sons of the people or the principle of student elec- 
tion from legislative districts, should themselves be recognized by repre- 
sentatives of the people as at least one influential factor in shaping civil 
service examinations, and also as a proper source of supply whenever 
special scientific service is required. Such service has been frequently 
sought from the Johns Hopkins University by the city of Baltimore, 
by the State of Maryland, and by the United States Government; but 
_ the principle should be fostered throughout the whole country in con- 
nection with the State universities, and it should be extended to the 
improvement of the civil service, methods of taxation, schools, boards 
of education, State examinations, ete. 
Universities should encourage their own graduates to enter the civil — 
service examinations of the higher grades in their respective States. 
Practical experience in a government office for two or three years would 
afford the best kind of post-graduate counse, especially if the State cap- 
itol and the State university should happen to be in the same city, so 
that further academic study might go hand in handwith practical work 
in an official bureau. Such an experience, as a subordinate under strict 
discipline, would prove a far better training for good and useful citizen- 
ship than does autocratic teaching in acountry high school. The writer 
knows of several Baltimore students who have entered the Patent 
Office at Washington, one a Hopkins Ph. D., who received from the civil 
service board the highest mark on competitive examination. He is now 
pursuing law studies in connection with his government work, with a 
view to becoming a patent lawyer. If one can understand how such 
practical training will prove helpful professionally to this young man, 
it will be readily seen that similar experience in other branches of the 
public service may not be without a wholesome influence upon sensible 
students. 
There are to-day scores of young men employed in government offices

  76 CIRCULARS OF INFORMATION FOR 1887. 
in Washington, many of them college graduates, who are also pursuing 
Jaw studies in evening classes in some one of the three flourishing law 
schools in that eity, viz, (1) Columbian University (Baptist) ;! (2) George- 
town College (Roman Catholic) ; and (3) the so-called National University. 
Soon there will be a richly endowed Roman Catholic university in the 
nation’s capital, and doubtless that institution will also take an impor- 
tant share in the legal or special training of some of the nation’s public 
servants. Men of sound sense in government employ will seek such 
opportunities more and more, on the one hand as a means of preparing 
for higher professional work, and, on the other, in the hope of improving 
their chances for promotion or influence in the public service. 
The Government is compelled to patronize institutions of learning 
from self-interest, for the reputation of its departments and its scien- 
tific bureaus, some of which are constantly turning to colleges and uni- 
versities for special work.. The War and Navy Departments have 
detailed no less than ten men for further scientific training or for the 
conduct of necessary government investigations at the Johns Hopkins 
University. Various members of the university staff have beeen em- 
ployed upon special commissions in the interest of the Geological and 
Coast Surveys, Bureau of Education, etc. This comity between science 
and the Government ought not only to continue, but to be promoted, 
especially with reference to political science. 
IDEA OF A CIVIL ACADEMY IN WASHINGTON. 
While the national Government will continue to seek special service 
wherever it can best be found, and while its public servants will con- 
tinue to seek special training wherever they prefer, it is not inexpedient 
to suggest that the Government might easily secure for the civil service 
what West Point and Annapolis have so long provided for the Army 
and Navy, viz, well-trained men for administrative positions requiring 
expert service. There is in ‘these times as great need of special kiiowl- 
edge in civil science as in military or naval science. A civil academy 
for the training ofrepresentative American youth would be as great a 
boon to the American people as the Military and Naval Academies have 
already proved. ; 
The West Point and Annapolis idea of educating representative 
young men from political districts is already abroad in nearly every 
State in the American Union. A combination of this idea with the

are in government service; of the 100 medical students, 45 per cent.; of the 80 scien- 
tific students, 50 per cent. From Georgetown College and the “National University ” 
the writer has not succeeded in obtaining returns, but in the opinion of good judges 
of the Washington situation, from 40 to 50 per cent. of the student class in these three 
professional schools are government employés. There is a decided Gemand for special 
education on the part of our existing civil service. The tendency should be encour- 
aged in every legitimate way.

merit system in appointment is frequently made by Congressmen in the 
institution of a competitive examination to discover whom they shall 
appoint as cadets. The joint system has long been established in the 
State of New York, the centre ‘of political gravity in these United 
States. The system should be taken up by the present administration, 
which sprang from New York and which represents the New York idea 
in administrative reform. The West Point plan of taking student ap- 
pointees from congressional districts, and the Cornell University plan 
of student appointment for merit, should be transplanted together to 
the city of Washington. From each of the three hundred and twenty- 
five congressional districts there should be appointed by the respective 
Congressmen, upon competitive examination held by the State or lead- 
ing university, or by some other impartial examining board, one student 
of the grade of bachelor of arts, to enjoy government tuition in Wash- 
ington for two years at a civil academy, as hereafter described, with an ' 
allowance of $600 a year for necessary expenses, as is now done for 
cadets at West Point and Annapolis. As at these two government 
academies, so in the Civil Academy, if properly constituted, undoubt- 
edly a large proportion of the appointees would be “ found deficient ;” 
many would resign for professional reasons or from dissatisfaction with 
the civil service, but a choice remnant would surely be saved to the 
state; the fittest would survive. Even if all returned to their own 
homes after two years’ public training, the cause of good citizenship 
would be greatly promoted. ; 
These student appointees, or government “ fellows,”! should not be 
required to herd in barracks or dormitories, but allowed to live like 
frugal citizens in Washington. They should not be under martial law or 
even scholastic discipline of the juvenile sort. They should be treated 
as responsible men under contract, as government employés, with 
special or assigned duties, under the general direction of an Educational 
Commission, appointed by the President for the specific purpose of 
managing the civil academy or government college, which would re- 
quire no very elaborate or costly equipment. A few lecture rooms and 
a working library would suffice. The students should be instructed in 
physical, historical, and economic geography; in political, constitu- 
tional, and diplomatic history; in the modern languages; and in all 
branches of political science, including political economy, statistics, 
forestry, administration, international law, comparative methods of 
legislation, and comparative politics. Instruction should be given in 
class sections (as at West Point) and in public lectures by govern- 
ment experts and university specialists, who might be engaged from 
time to time from different institutions for such services. The best tal-

ent of this country and of any other, whether university men or profes- 
sional politicians, could be commanded for such occasional work. 
In addition, the students should be distributed through the various 
government departments, at first in very subordinate and not too ex- 
acting positions, where they should be held accountable daily for a 
moderate amount of routine work or for certain practical tasks. Upon 
the daily record of such work and upon the results of occasional exami- 
nations, set by authority of the Hducational Commission in specified 
fields, should depend the tenure of office as government students and. 
the promotion to more advanced privileges of practical work, such as 
special investigations in the interest of branches of the administration. 
As a reward of merit, certain picked men might be detailed for special 
graduate work in different American universities or even in European 
universities, at the Ecole Libre in Paris or possibly in the Statistical 
Bureau at Berlin, both of which institutions are practical training 
schools in the art of administration. Men thus educated would prove 
of great service to the Bureau of Labor or to the Bureau of Statistics. 
They would be capable of doing much of the special work now required 
in the taking or elaboration of the United States census. At present, 
special economic or statistical work is sometimes done by men selected 
upon political recommendation and not always thoroughly fitted for 
the task required. 
That this idea is in the air of Washington and is not deemed imprac- 
ticable by practical politicians, is seen in the recent remark of Mr. Tren- 
holm, comptroller of the currency, who is reported to have said: “Tt is 
iny intention to take young men from various parts of the country and 
give them a preliminary training in this office; fit them for bank ex- 
aminers, and then appoint them. By this arrangement I think I will 
be able to have in these positions men who have excellent qualifications 
for their duties, and thus make a most efficient force of bank examiners. 
Besides, it will be the best kind of civil service reform.”? 
The system might be applied also to the training of picked young 
men for the consular, diplomatic, and other branches of the public serv- 
ice which require special knowledge. European Governments foster 
their civil and diplomatic services by systematic training in connection 
with government offices and schools of administration. The practice is 
‘already beginning to evolve in connection with the State Department 
and the training of consular clerks.? It might easily be extended in 
connection with other departments and the various scientific bureaus.

THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. 79 
The government commission for the civil service academy or govern- 
ment college should not be appointed in the interest of party, but of 
scientific politics and good administration. It should be as trustworthy 
as the three commissioners for the government of the District of Colum- 
bia, and ‘it should work in perfect harmony with the administrative 
offices of the government. 
The necessary elements for the beginning of a civil academy are for 
the most part already existing in the city of Washington, and only need 
to be properly co-ordinated. The practical appliances for a unique 
American experiment in the promotion of political education of the high- 
est sort for the sons of American citizens are already at hand in the 
government offices and various scientific bureaus. Foundations for the 
institutional or scholastic side of the proposed civil academy also exist 
in Washington. It is perhaps not generally known that the Federal 
City already contains one of the very best systems of public education in 
these United States. The high school of Washington is already a vir- 
tual seminary of history and political science. These subjects form a 
special department of instruction, employing one teacher and three 
assistants. The entire faculty isso thoroughly specialized in the teaching 
of natural science, mathematics, languages, etc., that in almost any other 
city save Washington this high school would be called a college. The 
institution, like the entire school system of the Federal City, has been 
under the sovereign control of Congress, and is largely supported by 
government appropriations. It is high time that this excellent system 
of public education should be carried one step higher, for Washington 
is not ak other cities. The existing high school should be developed into 
afree government college, supported by Congress, governed by the pro- 
posed commission, and supplying sich further scholastic training in the 
arts and sciences as members of the existing civil service or future 
appointees to the civil academy might require. Upon these scholastic 
or purely academic foundations should be superimposed a system of 
lectures by government experts and university specialists, as already 
described. 
Suggestive information respecting European methods of promoting 
political education for governmental purposes may be found in the re- 
port of the Paris Exposition of 1878. That portion of the commission- 
ers’ report relating to the subject of political education was written by   
    
appointment i must be » satisfactorily ‘shown to the Secretary of State, after exami- 
nation and report by an examining board, that the applicant is qualified for the du- 
ties to which he may be assigned. A consular clerk cannot be removed, except by 
cause stated in writing, which must be submitted to Congress at the session first 
following such removal. Consular clerks hold office during good behavior. They usually 
receive instruction at the Department of State before going to their posts. The idea under- 
lying this system is that of training young men for consular positions of the higher grade. 
One consular clerk, not now in the service, was promoted to a consulship; many of 
them have been made vice consuls, and some of the present incumbents fill the vice- 
consular office in addition to the consylar clerkship,

  80 _ CIRCULARS OF INFORMATION FOR 1887. 
Hon. Andrew D. White, and contains a most instructive résumé of 
what has been done in this regard in every great modern state. A part 
of this report was given as a public address on “ Education in Political 
Science” by President White before the Johns Hopkins University, ou 
its third anniversary, February 22, 1879. The address was published 
in pamphlet form in Baltimore, but the original detailed report is more 
serviceable for the purpose here suggested. 
Another interesting and valuable report is that on the “Training by 
Universities of the Public Servants of the State,” published in the Pro- 
ceedings of the Educational Conference! held in London in 1884. The 
Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques, to which reference is made in this 
report, is a model civil academy, devoted to the preparation of young 
men for the service of the French Republic. Instruction in the art of 
administration, in finance, diplomacy, public law, and history, is given 
by government officials, senators, retired ministers, professors, and men 
of the highest repute as practical economists and politicians. So excel- - 
lent is the work of this French school that the University of Virginia and 
the School of Political Science, Columbia College, have sent thither grad- 
uate students for the study of administration and political science. Two 
graduates from the Johns Hopkins University are proposing to spend 
the coming year in the same civil academy. If this country fails to pro- 
vide the proper means for teaching what is most needed in America, our 
young Americans will find means abroad, and, when they :eturn, they 
will be likely to institute suggestive comparisons for the information 
of their countrymen. There is crying need of schools of administra- 
tion in this country. Dorman B. Eaton, the recent head of the Civil 
Service Commission, said to the graduate students in Baltimore that he 
did not know of asingle place in. the whole country where men could 
study what the country wants to know about methods of administra- 
tion. The case is not quite so grievous as that, for a beginning has 
already been made in this kind of work in Columbia College, in the 
University of Pennsylvania, in Baltimore, and perhaps elsewhere. 
A third source of light and information is Doctor Engel’s descriptive 
pamphlet on the Seminary of the Prussian Statistical Bureau, pub- 
lished in German, Berlin, 1864, This institution is a training school 
for university graduates of the highest ability in the art of administra- 
tion, and in the conduct of statistical and other economic inquiries that 
are of interest and importance to the Government. The practical work 
is done in connection with government offices, among which advanced 
students are distributed with specific tasks. Systematic instruction is 
given by lectures, and by the seminary or laboratory method, under a 
general director. Government officials and university professors are 
engaged to give regular courses to these advanced students. It is con- 
sidered one of the greatest student honors in Berlin for a university

graduate to be admitted to the Statistical Seminary. ‘It is easier for for- 
eigners to secure this privilege than for Germans. One graduate of the 
Johns Hopkins University (a doctor of philosophy) has enjoyed in- 
struction in that Prussian laboratory of political science. If one would 
see what good. work comes forth from that Berlin civil academy, he 
should examine the catalogue of the periodicals and other publications 
which have been issued by the Statistical Bureau! and commission his 
Berlin bookseller to send him a few specimen monographs. Through 
this bureau the University of Berlin and the Prussian administration 
are brought into closest rapport. The work of taking the census of ’ 
Prussian population and resources is intrusted to educated men, trained 
to scientific accuracy by long discipline and practical experience. The 
work of the Prussian census in 1875 was so well arranged that all the 
results were delivered at noon on the day promised, and the entire cost 
was kept within the original estimate. 
CENTENARY OF THE INAUGURATION OF THE CONSTITUTION, 1889. 
In December, 1886, there met in the city of Philadelphia delegates 
from the various States and Territories to devise plans for the celebra- 
tion, September 17, 1887, of the centenary of the signing of our present 
national Constitution. Among the measures proposed and agreed upon 
by the conference was “the creation of a suitable memorial in the city 
of Philadelphia commemorative of the signing and adoption of the 
Constitution.”? 
On January 10, 1887, a select committee of the Senate reported the 
following resolutions, which were considered by unanimous consent and 
agreed to: 
Resolved, That it is expedient that order be taken by Congress for the due celebra- 
tion at the city of Washington, on or about the 30th of April, 1889, of the centennial 
of the inauguration of the Constitution of the United States. 
Resolved, further, That the Select Committee on the Centennial of the Constitution 
and the Discovery of America be directed to consider and propose the best mode of 
carrying out the foregoing resolution.® 
. Undoubtedly the idea of a permanent memorial of the Constitution 
in the city of Washington will find its way into Congress through the 
influence of the Select Committee on the Centennial. Whatever shape 
the celebration may take, there will naturally be a desire to establish 
‘some centennial landmark. The times are therefore ripe for suggestion.

  82 CIRCULARS OF INFORMATION FOR 1887. 
It will be remembered by every student of American constitutional 
history that, when the original convention of State delegates met in the 
city of Philadelphia in 1787, various plans were suggested for the ref- 
ormation of that defective system of government under which the 
United States had suffered since the first institution of the Articles of 
Confederation in 1777. Among the plans was one suggested by Gov- 
ernor Randolph, representing the Virginia delegation of seven men. 
He proposed, in a series of resolutions, the great idea “‘ that a national 
government ought to be established, consisting of a supreme legisla- 
tive, executive, and judiciary.” The Virginia proposition, in the process 
of debate, evolved into the present Constitution of the United States. 
Randolph’s resolutions were known as the “ Virginia plan.” 
There could hardly be a more appropriate mode of creating a perpet- 
ual memorial of our Federal Constitution than by nationalizing at Wash- 
ington and everywhere promoting throughout the individual States that 
system of education in good citizenship which made the Virginia plan 
a possibility, which trained up such public men as George Washington, 
Edmund Randoiph, John Blair, George Mason, Professor George Wythe, 
Professor James McClurg, and James Madison, the seven members of 
the Virginia delegation, of whom at least six were in some way, as alum- 
nus, professor, or overseer, connected with the old College of William 
and Mary, that school of Jefferson and of American statesmen. A per- 
manent memorial of our Federal Constitution should revive and perpet- 
uate the higher education in history and politics, which was well repre- 
sented by the Fathers of the Republic, notably by James Madison! and 
George Washington in their historical study of federal government, from 
the time of the Grecian leagues down to the Swiss Cantons, the United 
Netherlands, and the old German Confederation. Equally remarkable 
evidence of the fact that our Constitution was founded and maintained 
by the aid of political science and of historical politics is seen in the 
Federalist and in John Adams’s Defence of the Constitution. If we 
would commemorate the patriotic work of the framers of our Constitu- 
tion, we should promote in every possible way throughout this country 
and at the nation’s capital that political wisdom upon which the Union 
was established. 
  
1 Madison’s Notes on Ancient and Modern Confederacies, preparatory to the Federal Con- 
vention of 1787 (see his Writings, i, 293-315), afford very conclusive evidence as to the 
historical and political ’studies which were cultivated by the authors of the “‘ Virginia 
plan.” Washington copied out Madison’s Notes in the most painstaking manner for 
his own practical guidance (see the Writings of Washington, edited by Jared Sparks, 
vol. ix, pp. 521-528). Mr. Sparks says in a foot note, ‘‘I can give no other account of 
the manuscript, than that it exists among his papers. It could hardly have been 
drawn up originally by him, as several works are cited which were written in lan- 
guages that he did not understand.” Comparison shows that the original work was 
Madison’s. James Madison was a graduate of Princeton, but he became one of the 
visitors of William and Mary,

fustitutions of learning are, after all, nobler monuments to great men 
and great events than are obelisks or statues of marble. The national 
endowment or permanent support of the higher political education 
“within the limits of the District of Columbia, under the auspices of 
the General Government,” would realize the highest ideal of the Father 
of his country. This ideal was Washington’s last will and testament 
to the American people.

  APPENDIX. 
A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE HISTORY OF WILLIAM AND MARY COLLEGE. 
_ Nore.—The writer is indebted for the use of documents, catalogues, and pamphlets: 
introductory to his subject to the valuable collections already made by the Bureau of 
Education. Nowhere in this country can the history of American schools, colleges, 
or universities, be so well studied as in the city of Washington. The materials and 
bibliographies there accessible are of surprising extent and value, when one considers 
the slender resources and inadequate appropriations with which the Bureau has done 
its useful work. Institutions of learning should take pains, each for itself, to supply 
this national repository of educational archives with as perfect a collection of docu- 
mentary materials and as full a bibliography as can be prepared. Something has 
already been done in many instances, but in others even the catalogue files are very 
defective. Inthe centennial year, at the request of the Bureau, manuscript or printed. 
accounts of the history of many colleges and universities were forwarded to Washing- 
ton, and are now preserved in the educational library. This valuable collection should 
be properly supplemented, revised, and ultimately arranged for publication, after the 
manner of that excellent compilation on Public Libraries in the United States, pub- 
lished by the Bureau of Education in 1876. 
In order that the bibliographical results of his own special study of the College of 
William and Mary may not be lost, the writer appends the titles of works which he 
has found of service. 
Hening’s Statutes of Virginia. 1809-20. 
This early historical collection of Virginia laws from 1619 to 1792 is one of the most important 
sources of the educational history of Virginia. a 
Palmer’s Calendar of Virginia State Papers, 1875-85. 
Doctor Palmer's able and excellent work of compilation (from 1652) has been done since the 
‘War, and has now reached its fifth volume. This series suggested the publication of the 
Maryland archives by the Maryland Historical Society, at the expense of the State. Both series 
are invaluable to the students of southern institutions. 
The Acts of the Assembly and the various Codes of Virginia. 
In the indexes, under the heads of Education, Schools, Colleges, Williamsburg, William and 
Mary College, University, very many important facts may be found respecting the history of 
the higher education in Virginia. 
The Official Letters of Alexander Spotswood, Lieutenant-Governor of the Colony of 
Virginia, 1710-1722. 2vols. Richmond, 1882-85. 
These letters, carefully edited and annotated by Mr. R. A. Brock, the accomplished secretary 
and librarian of the Virginia Historical Society, are at once most interesting evidence as to the 
devotion of the early Virginians to their college, and as to the present renaissance of historical 
studies in the New South. Governor Spotswood’s activity in the interest of William and Mary 
College reminds one of Jefferson’s services to the University of Virginia.

upon order by telegraph from that public-spirited American citizen, W. W. Corcoran, Esq., of 
Washington, D. C., and were by him presented to the Virginia Historical Society.

This document, published in Baltimore and Richmond for the sake of reviving public interest 
in the college, is by far the most valuable historical account of the institution. It was this work 
which first interested the present writer in William and Mary, and it has afforded him more 
suggestive . id than any other one work. It contains the most important original documents re- 
lating to the college, the charter, deed of transfer, etc. ; and an historical sketch from materials 
prepared by the late Professor Robert Morrison, who represented the department of history and 
political economy in ante bellum days. The writer takes this occasion to acknowledge, in the 
most grateful way, his special indebtedness to Professor Morrison for his pioneer service in in- 
vestigating the history of William and Mary College. If every professor of history would take as 
much interest in the origin and development of the college or university which he represents, 
the records of the higher educationin the United States would be much better known than they 
are at present.

Foote’s Sketches of Virginia, Historical and Biographical. Philadelphia, 1850. 
This is a valuable collection of materials for the educational history of Virginia. The work is 
written from a Presbyterian point of view, but it is very just to William and Mary College, 
which represents the Episcopal Church. Foote’s Sketches contain interesting information re- 
specting the ‘‘log colleges” and the introduction of Princeton ideas into Virginia and the Caro- 
linas. A North Carolina graduate student, from Wake Forest College, now at the Johns Hopkins 
University, is upon this trail. Foote traces the rise of Liberty Hall Academy, now Washington 
and Lee University, and also the history of its ancient rival, Hampden-Sidney College, in Prince 
Edward County. One must understand the influence of these Presbyterian institutions of learn- 
ing in Virginia in order to realize why William and Mary College failed to become what the 
University of Virginia now is. A non-sectarian institution was absolutely necessary to balance 
these rival forces.

college building.

The Bishop of Iowa has done great service to historical science by collecting and editing 
original documents. Many of them are of great interest and importance to the College of Will- 
jam and Mary. The character and writings of Commissary Blair, the first college president in 
Virginia, are well illustrated. There is a picture of the college in vol. i, p. 123. 
History of the American Episcopal Church. 1885.

A file of this magazine is a veritable treasure-house of historical and sociological materials re-

privately printed. 1860. 
This neat little volume, of one hundred pages, the first of a proposed series of ‘“ Historical 
Documents from the Old Dominion” begun just before the outbreak of the civil war, contains, 
in the introduction, some interesting topographical details respecting the city and neighborhood 
of Williamsburg. The book is a curious historic link between the outbreak of the revolutionary 
war and of the civil war.

John Esten Cooke’s Virginia. 1883, 
This introductory volume in the American Commonwealth Series is the most recent history of 
the State, and describes in a graphic manner its historic seat of learning. Mr. Cooke, whose re- 
cent death is deplored by all who knew him, wrote an excellent magazine article upon William 
and Mary College, for Scribner's Monthly, November, 1875, where it enjoyed the leading place. 
‘twas an illustrated article, and from it have been taken, by the courtesy of theCentury Company, 
the plates in the present monograph. Besides those already shown, there are various others of 
historical interest, for example, the old Raleigh Tavern, with its famous ‘‘ Apollo Room,” where 
the court balls and social assemblies of colonial Virginia were held ; where Jefferson and his col- 
lege friends used to dance; and where the Virginia House of Burgesses reassembled after it had 
been dissolved by Earl Dunmore. There, as in the tennis court at Versailles, a popular revolu- 
tion wasinaugurated. The oldcapitol at Williamsburg is also pictured. There, in1765, occurred 
that famons debate on the Stamp Act, when Patrick Henry said, ‘‘If this be treason, make the 
mostof it!” Theold capitol, ‘‘the heart of rebellion” in those revolutionary days, was destroyed 
by fire in 1832, but a chance drawing of it by a Williamsburg lady is reproduced in Mr. Cooke's 
article. In fact, the reading of his pictorial sketch is almost as profitable as an actual visit to 
Williamsburg. 
  John Austin Stevens. Centennial Handbook. New York, 1881. 
This is the most convenient guide for the historical pilgrim visiting Williamsburg and other 
points of interest in that region between the York and James Rivers, doubly famous as a seat 
of war. There the Continental army and the French allies forced the British to capitulate ; 
there the American Revolution was successfully ended ; there the forces of a divided Republic 
long struggled for the mastery. Williamsburg, both in the American Revolution and in the late 
civil war, was a strategic base of military operations, the very key to the Yorktown peninsula. 
‘Whoever unlocks that old Williamsburg portal, whether in the study of war or peace, politics, 
society, church, or education, unlocks the whole history of Virginia. 
Lossing’s Pictorial Field-Book of the Revolution (1851), vol. ii, pp. 262-265, 278. 
  The modern student who returns to this good friend of his youth to see what is said about old 
Virginia and Williamsburg will feel as grateful as he does to ‘‘ Porte-Crayon” for his Virginia Illus- 
trated. The man who drove fourteen hundred miles in a wagon, visiting revolutionary scenes, 
north and south, can give ‘‘points” to aspiring excursionists of the new school. Here are some 
of his notes: ‘‘Iarrived at Williamsburg atnoon [December 20, 1848], and proceeded immediately 
to search out the interesting localities of that ancient and earliest incorporated town in Virginia. 
They are chiefly upon the main street, a broad avenue pleasantly shaded, and almost as quiet as 
arural lane. I first took a hasty stroll upon the spacious green in front of William and Mary 
College, the oldest literary institution in America except Harvard University. The entrance to 
the green is flanked by stately live oaks, cheering the visitor in winter with their evergreen foli- 
age. In the centre of the green stands the mutilated statue of Lord Botetourt, the best be- 
loved of the colonial governors. This statue was erected on the old capital in 1774, and in 1797 
it was removed to its present position. I did not make a sketch of it, because a student at the 
college promised to hand me one made by his own pencil before I left the place. He neglected 
to do so Speaking of the Apollo Room in the rear building of the old Raleigh Tavern, Los- 
sing says: ‘‘Up to the day of my arrival it had remained unaltered. Carpenters were then at 
work remodelling its style, for the purpose of making it a ball-room. * * * Had my visitbeen 
deferred a day longer, the style of the room could never have been portrayed. * * * Tho 
sound of the hammer and saw engaged in the work of change seemed to me like actual desecra- 
tion ; for the Raleigh Tavern and the Apollo Room are to Virginia, relatively, what Faneuil 
Hall is to Massachusetts.” If the modern student would see how the room appeared to Mr. Los- 
sing, lot him look in the Field-Book, vol. ii, p. 278. The accompanying sketch is taken from Mr. 
Cooke’s article.

“It is a pity,” he says, ‘‘when one considers the educational needs of the South, that some- 
thing should not be done to perpetuate this old college, second only to Harvard in age and his- 
torical interest, both in memory of its great past and in the active service of the present. Such 
great traditions as those of William and Mary Oollege are themselves of the highest sty 4 ‘in edu- 
cation and ought not to be wasted.”

«*PROFESSOR HERBERT B, ADAMS: 
“Dear Sir:—Do not suppose that my delay in replying to your letter of the 14th ultimo 
has arisen from any failure on my part to gratefully appreciate the proof it gave of 
your interest in this old college. The manifestations of similar interest by gentlemen

THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. 89 
prominent in their several walks of life all over the country assure me now, as they 
hhave done since 1865, that existing difficulties will in time be overcome, and that this 
institution will take another lease of educational life. That President Gilman shares 
in the possession of this interest I know from a limited correspondence I have had 
with him. 
“There are no students here now, and I am the only person belonging to the college 
faculty at the present time. The college was forced to incur a building debt after 
1865, and its endowment, greatly diminished by the accidents of war, was not suffi- 
cient to pay this debt and support a faculty. After repeated attempts to do both, it 
became evident that the vitality of the college required a temporary closing, and the 
annual proceeds of its endowment to be applied to the payment of its pecuniary obli- 
gations. As the faculty is the corporation, its chartered and corporate title being 
‘The President and Masters or Professors of the College of William and Mary in Vir- 
ginia,” it was necessary to preserve the form of the faculty, with the minimum of sub- 
stance. Under this policy the debts have been reduced from $28,000 to about $7,000. 
When this indebtedness is satisfied it is estimated that the college will have its build- 
ings and contents, worth some $30,000, and an endowment of $40,000, more or less, yield- 
ing an income of $2,500. With this asa nucleus, free from all incumbrance, it may hap- 
pen that some of the liberal northern men will complete its endowment. * * * 
“‘A year or two ago a wealthy Bostonian died, and in his will was a legacy to the 
college of $400,000. To this will there had been a codicil annexed, transferring the 
gift to the University of Virginia. The college wishes the death of no one, but may 
not, in time, a wealthy benefactor insert a similar provision in his will and, unfor- 
tunately, ‘join the great majority” before he annexes such a mischievous codicil? 
“The above pretty well answers your questions—most of them I should say, for 
there is one relating to the college bell not yet attended to. There is an ancient tra- 
dition connected with the college to the effect that a full session of students followed 
the ringing of its bell! on the 1st of October at sunrise. The session began early in 
October. The transformation of this tradition into a daily ringing by me exceeds 
the story of the ‘Three black crows.’ But, to compensate, it has given me a wide 
reputation as a ‘bell-ringer,’ equal or superior to that of the celebrated ‘Swiss bell- 
ringers.’ So I laugh at the story without murmuring or contradicting. I send you 
:a catalogue of the college (general), and inclose one or two extracts from newspapers. 
“ Most respectfully, yours, 
“Bend. S. EWELL.” 
  
1 Regarding the bell-ringing at the opening of each academic year, the writer has been assured, on 
independent testimony from Williamsburg, that the old custom is still kept up. And here is collat- 
eral evidence from a northern man, Mr. Edwin D. Mead, of Buston, who visited William and Mary 
College in-the spring of 1886: ‘The old, gray-haired president, as each October comes round, goes to 
the college and has the old college bell rung, as a formality to still retain the charter.” The writer 
may remark, en passant, that the charter does not require this annual duty; but tradition and the gen- 
eral consensus of Virginians compel us to believe in the propriety of the custom! The writer's friend, 
Mr. Mead, says that he talked with President Ewell there in Williamsburg ‘in these last May days,” 
and that the good president ‘ believes that the bell will yet be heard.” In a letter which Mr. Mead 
‘received from President Ewell, the latter said: “I believe some northern man will immortalize him- 
self by re-endowing William and Mary College, and that it will be again as useful as it has been in the 
past.” Mr, Mead quoted this in a lecture in the Old South Church in Boston, and put the question: 
“Who is the northern man that will hear this prophecy and fulfill it?”

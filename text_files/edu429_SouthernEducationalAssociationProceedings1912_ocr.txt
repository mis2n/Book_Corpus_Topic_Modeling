SECRETARY-TREASURER’S REPORT. 
Loursvitte, Kentucky, November 27, 1912. 
To the Board of Directors of the S. E. A., Louisville, Kentucky: 
GunTLEMEN—I beg to submit the following report of my work 
as Secretary-Treasurer of the Southern Educational Association 
since the last meeting of the Association at Houston, November 30, 
December 1 and 2, 1911. 
I am happy to say that the Association is now clear of all indebt- 
edness. In order that we may have a record of the matter, your 
Secretary-Treasurer deems it best and proper to incorporate in this 
report a list of those who assisted in removing the indebtedness of 
the Association. I desire to read you a copy of a circular which I 
addressed to 250 members of the Association on December 14, 1911. 
The letter is as follows: 
Dear Strr—You are one of two hundred and fifty to whom I am addressing 
this communication. To reply unfavorably will interfere materially with the 
plan proposed. 
All who attended the Houston meeting pronounced it the greatest meeting 
in the history of the Association. Many who were heretofore indifferent are now 
enthusiastic as to the possibilities of the Association. Your present Secretary 
inherited from the former Secretary (Mr. H. E. Bierly) a debt of more than 
$2,500, and one year’s experience as Secretary has demonstrated to him that 
the debt can never be paid out of savings from annual dues paid by the mem- 
bership. In fact, the full amount of these dues is necessary for the printing 
of the proceedings and paying the general incidental expenses connected with 
the running of the Association. 
Are you not willing to make a small sacrifice in order to liquidate our 
indebtedness immediately? To have this debt hanging over us interferes 
with the progress of the Association, and besides, is extremely embarrassing 
to your present Secretary. While neither you nor I may be responsible for 
the making of this debt, the good name of the Association is involved and the 
debt must be paid. 
To the office of Secretary-Treasurer (these offices were combined at the 
Houston meeting) no remuneration is attached; but I am willing to be one 
of two hundred and fifty to pay $10.00 to “wipe out” our indebtedness. Will 
you be another? If so, sign the enclosed postal card and return it to me by 
the next mail. J shall not call on you for the ten dollars unless a sufficient 
number respond favorably to pay off the indebtedness. 
When the 1912 proceedings are printed, due credit will be given those who 
assist in paying off this debt placed on the Association by Mr. Bierly. 
Please let me hear from you by return mail. 
Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) Wm. F. Fracin, 
Secretary-Treasurer.

    16 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
On February 21, 1912, your Secretary-Treasurer was delighted 
to address the following letter to the members of the Association 
who had sent in subscriptions to liquidate the indebtedness: 
Dear Si (or Mapam)—This is to inform you that I have sufficient pledges 
to liquidate the indebtedness of the S. E. A. made by Mr. Bierly, the former’ 
Secretary, during the years 1909 and 1910. In accordance with your promise, 
please send me immediately a check to cover the amount of your subscription. 
I am so sure that every cent pledged by the various members will be paid 
that I have made a loan at a local bank for the total amount pledged, and I am 
today sending to each creditor a check to cover in full his account against us. 
On behalf of the Association, I wish to thank you for your generosity and 
kindness in liquidating this debt. You have assisted materially in removing 
a heavy load from the shoulders of your Secretary. 
Trusting you will send me the check by return mail, and with the highest 
personal regards, I am, Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) Wm. F. Fracin, 
Secretary-Treasurer. 
I give you below a list of names of those who assisted in liquidat- 
ing the indebtedness of the Association, and the amount subscribed 
by each:

Your Secretary-Treasurer has kept an accurate account of all 
receipts and disbursements since making his last report and has 
kept all funds in the bank and paid all items by check. I have with 
me all of my record books, vouchers, etc., and I shall thank you to 
appoint a committee to carefully check and report on them during

  During the year the Executive Committee, composed of the Presi- 
dent, the First Vice-President and the Secretary-Treasurer, held 
two meetings: one in Montgomery, Ala., on March 14, 1912, and the 
other in Birmingham on September 21, 1912. A copy of the min- 
utes of the first meeting of the committee was mailed to each mem- 
ber of the Board of Directors and to each President and Secretary 
of the various departments. The second meeting was held for the 
purpose of deciding some matters relating to the program of the 
Louisville meeting. 
Both the preliminary and final programs of the Louisville meet- 
ing were paid for by the Association this year. Twelve thousand 
preliminary programs were printed and systematically distributed 
over the territory of the 8. E. A.; seven thousand final programs 
were printed and five thousand of these were distributed, the bal- 
ance being kept for distribution at the Louisville meeting. 
The time has come when we must amend our constitution; or, 
what would be better, appoint a committee of five to write a new 
constitution to be submitted to the Association at the 1913 meeting. 
In the latter case, I would recommend that the incoming President 
and Secretary-Treasurer be e#-officio members of this committee. 
At the Houston meeting of the Board of Directors on November 
30, the Secretary-Treasurer was authorized and directed to incor- 
porate the S. E. A. After consulting several attorneys, it was 
thought best not to attempt the incorporation by States, but to 
submit to you the proposition of having a bill introduced in the next 
Congress incorporating the S. E. A. in a manner similar to that of 
the N. E. A. 
Although your constitution and by-laws do not require it, and 
neither did the Board of Directors pass a resolution authorizing 
it to be done, your Secretary-Treasurer deemed it best and proper to 
make a surety bond for $2,500. This bond was made for four years 
and is payable to the President of the Association. The bond is

now in the hands of President Whitfield and should be turned over 
to his successor by him. 
During the past year hundreds of letters have been written, and 
I have made it a point to reply to every communication which came 
to me. I have also sent many circulars to the Board of Directors, 
members of the Association and Presidents and Secretaries of the 
various departments. Respectfully, 
Ws. F. Feacin, 
Secretary-Treasurer.

Treasurer for the year 1912; and for the year 1913 he be paid a salary of

if not, that such part of this amount be paid as will not embarrass the- 
Association. 
Resolved, further, That the salary of the Secretary-Treasurer be increased!

8.00 p.m. The convention was called to order by Supt. E. O. 
Holland. 
Mr. Hotianp: Ladies and Gentlemen—It devolves upon the 
superintendent of the city schools to introduce the speakers deliv- 
ering the addresses of welcome. This is the twenty-third annual con- 
vention of the Southern Educational Association. The first address 
was to have been given by the Mayor of the city, but he telephoned 
me a few moments ago that a conflict of engagements would make 
it impossible for him to be here. He was kind enough to ask the 
Rey. Dr. Aquilla Webb, pastor of this church to deliver the address 
in his place. I will introduce to you Dr. Webb. 
Ds. Wnss: This is one of the difficulties we sometimes get in. 
I remember when the Governor of this State was to have addressed 
the meeting of the Salvation Army, he telephoned me to write out 
the address and deliver it. This I did; then I sent him a copy, and 
he said it was hardly worth while for him to come, and he was 
delighted with his speech. (Laughter.) On this occasion I have 
the pleasure of representing the Mayor to welcome you to our city. 
He was delighted to have you present in the State, and said that the 
keys of the city were turned over to you, and if any of you get into 
trouble, you can consult the Chief of Police, the Mayor or myself, 
and we will get you out of it. 
You will find one thing about the city of Louisville. You will 
be welcomed on every hand. This is a great big village, where we
-P-A-G-E-29
  \ 
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 29 
speak whether we are introduced or not. You will find in this 
city hospitality that will warm your hearts, which will make you 
want to come here to live. There is no association that would be 
more welcome or more appreciated than the Southern Educational 
Association. I want to say on behalf of the church also that you 
are welcome. It has not been the purpose of this congregation to 
to open the church for any meetings except religious, but when this 
matter came before our body, the opinion was voiced unanimously 
that you are one with us just as in the Child Welfare. While we 
have a great problem before us, we expect from you great help and 
inspiration. 
On behalf of the Mayor, the citizens of Louisville and this 
church, I hope you will have a most delightful and profitable meet- 
ing while you are in our city. (Applause.) 
Mr. Houranp: I believe I am not guilty of exaggerating when 
I make the statement that the progress in education in America 
during the past twenty years has been phenomenal. Certain 
States, certain cities, have led the way, and you will find in every 
progressive State and city a group of men and women pointing out 
the way. The educational advancement of this city is largely due 
to the interest taken by both men and women in Louisville, but I 
do not know of any man or any person to whom a larger share of 
praise should be given than the President of the Board of Educa- 
tion of this city, who is to deliver the second address of welcome on 
this occasion. I believe I am right when I say that that man has 
had a vision of better schools for every boy and girl in the city, and 
though that vision has not been entirely realized, the vision is still 
before us, a little bit more clearly outlined, a little more nearly 
within the realm of reality. I take pleasure in introducing to you 
the President of the Louisville Board of Education, Dr. I. N. ~ 
Bloom. (Applause.) 
Dr. Broom: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen of the South- 
ern Educational Association—It is indeed a pleasant duty to bid 
you welcome in behalf of the Board of Education of the city of 
Louisville. We rejoice at your advent and shall eagerly follow 
your deliberations to gain such knowledge as may be of value to 
us in the work with which we are charged. Yours is a heavy burden 
and a great responsibility rests upon you. 
In your sessions you are largely determining the future of the 
South—for in a republic, the aim of the school is the development of 
its citizenship.  
-P-A-G-E-30
  30 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The wisdom of your councils must be deliberate, your advice 
well weighed, for its results are not immediate, but must show in 
the next and succeeding generations. Upon it depends largely the 
character of the people who must follow us in the development of 
this great country of ours. 
The home, the school and the church are the main educating 
forces in the lives of us all, and character is largely dependent upon 
the kind of influence these factors exert; therefore, I say, you must 
weigh well your words and meditate deeply ere you give expression 
to them. 
I should say that our growing defect is irreverence and. disregard 
of authority and it is manifest in many directions. In school 
affairs, we see it in the belief that anyone can direct them, that 
good superintendents, professors, principals, teachers exist in such 
numbers that the supply far exceeds the demand. Again, in the 
readiness with which each educational fad is seized upon and 
adopted before its untrained originator has grasped the significance 
of the change. 
The past is full of false prophets of education, and the present 
abounds with those who forget the wisdom of Epictetus, who said 
that they only should criticise and advise, who by training and 
study are fitted for it— 
“Hold fast 
To what the past has shown as good. 
Test well the new, 
Lest it may shine as beautiful 
Yet not be true.” 
What school education should be, how varied and how distrib- 
uted, you are well qualified to determine. Blessed be your conclu- 
sions. (Applause.) 
Mr Horianp: We are fortunate this evening in having an oppor- 
tunity to hear the two leading churchmen of the city—the man 
who delivered the address of welcome for the Mayor and the man 
who is on the program to deliver the third address of welcome for 
the city at large. I take pleasure in presenting to you Bishop 
Charles E. Woodcock, of this city. (Applause.) 
BisHor Woopcock: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen—It is 
not a small honor to have even a small share in extending a wel- 
come to the members of the Southern Educational Association. I 
do it on behalf of the city and on behalf of our churches; but in 
inviting you to partake of our hospitality, we do not thereby con- 
sider that we have discharged our obligation, for we are doubly
-P-A-G-E-31
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 81 
indebted to you—first, because of the marked compliment you 
bestow upon us by choosing our city as your meeting place, and 
then, especially for the great benefit which we believe we shall 
derive from your coming. There is no way we can discharge this 
obligation and there is no method of welcoming you, no manner of 
expressing the honor we feel you have paid us in coming here. We 
have nourished eager expectations of your coming in the belief 
that you will leave with us a great benefit. I am sure Dr. 
Bloom will understand me when I say, a benefit that will be impor- 
tant and a benefit that will be far-reaching and lasting. You have 
laid us under these obligations, and we and our children are your 
grateful debtors. ‘ 
You are to consider some very important questions. You may 
look at a question, perhaps, from one point of view; you are send- 
ing out into the world men to do the work of the world. This is 
the position of the educator. Then from another point of view, 
meeting the men as they come out into the world, as they face temp- 
tation and hear the call of opportunity, and take the field and do 
the things that justify them in the claim for manhood; so I want 
to ask two questions here, if you will permit me. I know you are 
going to answer both of them completely during this session. 
First, what is an education? There is no definition of it. Of 
course, we could give it what is called a technical definition, but I 
see men who have finished their career in an institution; I see 
them out in the world and they are incapable of doing anything 
that would justify them for their graduation. Education is not 
merely to successfully complete the requirements of the curriculum; 
education is not merely feeding the intellect, for there is so much 
of it that starves the soul; education is not to be tested by ability 
to fill the requirements of a system; education is not a system 
that fits the child to any man’s idea and moulds all children in the 
same mould; but education is to find the needs of the child, the 
bent of the child, and fit the system to the welfare of the child, even 
to the sacrifice of a great deal of specializing, which does not give 
the child equipment for the practical duties of his life. I am look- 
ing at it from the point as I see it. 
Some people seem to feel that they can buy education, buy cul- 
ture and refinement. I know culture that is perfectly flat and 
vapid, senseless and useless. It has no place but in the selfish 
purposes of the one who so lives. I do not believe that any real 
man or woman in this audience would consider that as an educa- 
tion. Education cannot be selfish and exclusive. Education is
-P-A-G-E-32
  382 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
not to teach, but to train—to train the child for great social and 
moral efficiency in this life. There is no secular education alone 
that can fit the child for life. It must have that which is coérdi- 
nated with it—the home, the school, the Sunday school, the church— 
and there is no educator in this country who may be successful and 
maintain the assertion that secular education alone can fit a man 
for what is required of him. The school should try to train the 
man. No school makes the man. The man will find his work and 
will do a man’s task. I think the schools are trying to teach these 
essentials. If they are not, then somebody else should do the teach- 
ing. They should teach the child that its life does not belong to 
itself and that his education does not end with him. The child’s 
life belongs to God, and the community depends upon what he can 
do for the welfare of this world. It seems almost impossible to 
secure a perfect system. The only thing you can do is to have 
teachers competent to develop character in the child; and, after all, 
is it not true (and you educators know it better than anyone else) 
that there is no larger element in education than the personality 
of the teacher? There has been altogether too much mere teaching. 
The age demands that which you alone can give to the age. We, 
who are out in the world, are incompetent to do it. We cannot 
give the training to equip so that the child can go out and meet the 
temptation, go out with the ambition to be his best self, and then 
justify all of the things you have striven so earnestly to impart. 
Education is the implanting of ideas and the development of char- 
acter, and in that, there is nothing greater, nothing larger than the 
personality of the teacher; so I appeal not to you, but to any of 
my fellow-citizens who are here, for a larger, more loyal, more 
generous support of our educators, if there is to be such a thing as 
progress. An educator is always twenty-five years ahead of the 
men who stand behind him, so we should equip him to carry out his 
ideas. He must fearlessly do his work, and we must trust him 
heartily, completely, absolutely. 
While I am detaining you longer than an address of welcome 
warrants, I wish to ask you one more question: What is education 
contributing to the present-day world? What does it propose to 
contribute? Are those who are educated and well-born (I do not 
mean born with a lot of money) and intelligent, those socially 
favored—are they contributing anything from their education to 
the world? With all our boasted advance in education, is there 
not a higher uplift of ideals? Is there not a higher standard of 
morality? Are more educated men and women enlisting them-
-P-A-G-E-33
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 33 
selves in personal service for the welfare of their fellow-man, service 
to which, perhaps, there is little honor attached, service which meets 
with little or no appreciation. Well, if our education is not mak- 
ing the world better—and all of it better—if it is not fighting the 
influences that are debauching and enslaving humanity, if it does 
not carry some men into Heaven on his own merit, then you have 
got to explain why it is called education, and when you have gotten 
through explaining, you have the humiliation of apologizing. If 
it is being done, then we need more of it. Birth, education, cul- 
ture and refinement are four great advantages, but they also carry 
with them responsible obligations. What your birth, brains and 
money should not do is to create class distinctions, exclusiveness 
and indifference. All the wealth and birth and brains and char- 
acter and money and refinement and culture ought to reach out 
to the poorest and vilest and smallest and weakest and uplift it, 
and if they are not doing that, then the worst man of that town 
and the vilest woman of that town can point to your educa- 
tion and refinement and culture and say, “I am what I am because 
you are what you are,” and it would perhaps, in a large measure, be 
true. I do not believe in that kind of education. I do not believe 
it is worth while. I believe it is an absolute waste of time, of 
men, of money and of children. Let us get rid of the sophistry 
that knowledge per se is power. Knowledge is power when it pro- 
duces something you cannot have without it. I know a man who 
could read, write and speak in twenty-four different languages, yet 
could not say anything in any one of them. I know of another 
man in Australia who had working for him four college graduates— 
men from Yale, Harvard, Princeton and Columbia—and the man 
who owned the farm could not read or write. Knowledge is not 
power unless you can use it. God will measure a man’s life by 
the proportion of his deed to his opportunity. Education leads to 
inspiration, and if enough of it, to aspiration. All living to love 
each, each living to love all. Any terms which can satisfy fulfill- 
ment of the life as it reaches out, and helps to live the life that has 
helped other people to do something, or the man who has been some- 
thing and helped others to be something, should be something like 
this; that he who crosses your threshold with a grief should come 
away without it. 
When education makes the man and the man finds his work, 
and when education enables men to live their lives more whole- 
somely, and when we have justified God for creating us, we shall

have given witness of what education has done for us by what we 
have done for others. (Applause.) 
Mr. Hoxtxanp: I will ask Dr. Dowling and Dr. Rall to come 
to the platform. (Dr. Dowling was absent; Dr. Rall responded.) 
The next on our program is the response for the Association by

Ladies and Gentlemen: This kind, this gracious, this truly royal 
welcome which has fallen so eloquently from the lips of your dis- 
tinguished representatives finds a hearty and a ready response in 
the hearts of these teachers who have assembled in your beautiful 
city to discuss those problems which when solved will further uplift 
the struggling childhood of our Southland. 
It is eminently fitting that we should gather in this progressive 
city among a people who have wrought so well in every undertak- 
ing which tends toward construction and expansion. 
Your splendid and efficient school system is within itself an 
inspiration to all of us. Some of us have had the pleasure of read- 
ing and studying books on pedagogy written by teachers in your 
schools. We have found these works so clear in exposition, so 
simple in statement, and so logical in conclusion that we have 
returned to the schoolroom, feeling that we should make no fur- 
ther mistakes and that, at least, the rod would no longer be neces- 
sary—until we attempted to put their theories into practice. 
Your progressive medical colleges have sent forth hundreds of 
physicians so learned in medicine and so skilled in its practice that 
they have received the commendation of the laity for their remark- 
able cures and have been able to bury their mistakes without excit- 
ing comment. 
Your great theological seminaries have graduated many earnest 
preachers so thoroughly grounded in the fundamental teachings of 
the Bible that we have yet to hear of one who will dare advance 
the opinion that the whale did not swallow Jonah. 
Your enterprising mercantile establishments, sending their wares 
to every part of the country, are so well managed that we are told
-P-A-G-E-35

their heads never cash a check for a stranger or fail to credit a 
Hardshell Baptist on first acquaintance. 
When the whole world thirsts for news and the reporters are 
searching every avenue to find it, our “Marse Henry” takes up his 
pen of fire and writes an editorial which causes many politicians 
to forget that war is hell. 
We shail stand in awe in your museum before that four-thou- 
sand-year-old Egyptian mummy king, referred to in our program, 
and feel that the record of Woodrow Wilson, our teacher President, 
will be one of such great achievement that four thousand years 
from now his title to fame will be as lasting as the pyramids from 
which this mummy king was removed. 
I am a prohibitionist, but I must tell you that a few years ago 
I stood upon the bridge which spans Niagara Falls. Beside me 
stood a young man who at ‘that time was the State Superintendent 
of Education of this Commonwealth. As I gazed upon the rush- 
ing, falling waters and listened to the thunders of the mighty cata- 
ract, I turned to note the effect of the sublime spectacle on my 
friend. To my surprise he was gazing upward utterly oblivious 
to the scene before us. I ventured to ask him why he was not 
impressed. “My friend,” he said, “If you will take three fingers of 
Kentucky Mountain Dew and repeat it several times at intervals 
of thirty minutes each, the roars of that cataract will be as the 
tinkling of a bell and yon rushing waters the flash of a rivulet.” 
Your hotels, so beautifully appointed and so courteously man- 
aged, have already made us feel at home, and we shal! take no 
thought of the morrow—until the bills are presented. 
All levity aside, ladies and gentlemen, we come into’ your city 
the bearers of glad tidings. We bring the same good reports from 
our States that have been sent forth from this Commonwealth, 
which has been on fire during the past few years with a spirit of 
unprecedented educational progress. No pessimistic note is to be 
sounded here. Too much of good to the cause has been accom- 
plished in the past and the future is too bright with promise for 
other than optimistic words to be uttered. 
These teachers assembled here are terribly in earnest about the 
work which is to be done. Their spirits are as brave and their 
resolves as high in this great battle in time of peace to take the 
Southland for education as were those of Henry of Navarre in time 
of bloody war, when he bade his soldiers to follow his white plume 
to victory. Each of these teachers bears the white plume of edu- 
cational progress and bids his fellows follow his leadership to the 
greater victory in behalf of struggling childhood.

The whole Southland is waiting upon the education of all the 
people. We are striving for that day to come, spoken of by the 
great apostle of public education, Thomas Jefferson, when he said, 
“Enlighten the people generally, and tyranny and oppression of the 
body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.” 
After all, ladies and gentlemen, the one great problem pressing 
upon us for solution is that of universal education, which does not 
simply mean that all must be educated, but rather that all shall 
have the opportunity to obtain the right kind of an education; and 
this means, if you please, that in the school of the near future 
the workshop, the factory, the counting house, the farm, the sick- 
room shall receive as much attention in the daily curriculum as 
the antiquity of the pyramids, the philosophy of Plato, the Odes of 
Horace, or the thunderbolts of Jupiter. 
We who meet here this evening to greet each other and to review 
the progress of the past year and vision the future of the coming 
ones are happy in the thought that the day is not far distant when 
the forceful educational sentiment, becoming manifest in every 
State of the South, shall crystallize into an active living force that 
will bring into operation a well-defined, definitely organized, intel- 
ligent, logical school system in every community, thus carrying the 
best educational advantages to all the people. 
Did I not know that the able President of the Association was 
now ready to entertain and instruct us with a full review of the 
work of the past year and with wise counsel and suggestion for the 
future, I might wish for more than the ten minutes allotted me 
to speak of these interests which press upon me at this moment. 
It is good for you that I must yield to the President. 
Before taking my seat, Mr. President, permit me in behalf of the 
Association, to again thank the gentlemen who spoke for the city, 
for their cordial welcome, and to assure them that as we mingle 
with their fellow-citizens, we shall feel at home every moment of 
our stay, and if perchance some jolly pedagogue so far from home 
may transgress some law of the city, we shall know three citizens 
who will go his bond for future good behavior while he lingers here. 
SUPERINTENDENT Horianp: Before introducing the President 
of the Association, I should like to say that if you will notify the 
Secretary, Mr. Feagin, concerning any information you want in 
respect to the Louisville public schools, he will direct you to the 
Board of Education. ; 
Following our usual custom, we have had no school today. We 
would have had one school in operation tomorrow, if the officers
-P-A-G-E-37
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 37 
had so advised, but they did not. We have made one exception, 
however. Within three or four blocks from the Seelbach Hotel, 
where your headquarters are located, we shall have tomorrow two 
special schools in operation—one for the boys who require a great 
amount of individual attention, and the other is an open-air school— 
and these two classes will be open to your inspection. You will 
also see in that building the beginning of the dental clinic, which 
we hope will be in operation in two weeks. The building is located 
at the corner of Second and Gray Streets. Anyone in the city can 
explain to you how to get to that building, and I suggest that you 
go there about 9 o’clock in the morning or about 1 to 1.30 in the 
afternoon. The children in the open-air school will have luncheon 
served to them at 11.45, if you care to see them then, after which 
they have a nap of two hours there in the building. We shall be 
glad to have you there tomorrow any time from 9 o’clock on to 1 
or 1.30. 
The permanent Chairman of the Southern Educational Associa- 
tion will take charge of the meeting this evening and of the subse- 
quent general meetings. It is not necessary for me to introduce 
that man to any educator in the South, but I may say to the visitors 
here this evening that that man is the President of the Mississippi 
Industrial Institute and College, one of the unique institutions of 
education in the country. 
I take pleasure in introducing to you the chairman of this Asso- 
ciation, Dr. H. L. Whitfield, who will now take charge. 
A Discussion or THE Higu ScHoon SrruaTIoNn or THE SourH. 
H. L. WHITFIELD, COLUMBUS, MISS. 
At the present time the high school is the strategic point in the 
public school system of the South. This is true for several reasons. 
The supreme effort that is being made to make the school an agency 
to adjust a child to his environment has at least made for the time 
being the high school the most conspicuous part of the system. If 
the common schools, wherein more than ninety per cent of our chil- 
dren are to get their life adjustments, are to be made suitable agents 
for the successful performance of this great function, then the 
preparation of teachers becomes the work of first importance. 
Where is it possible to get a supply of teachers sufficient for this 
vast undertaking which involves nothing less than the changing of 
the form, instruction and spirit of the common schools? The col- 
leges certainly cannot supply trained teachers in such numbers as  
-P-A-G-E-38
38 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
will be required to meet the needs and demands of twentieth cen- 
tury high schools. Clearly those who have had only that training 
which our common schools give are not prepared to do this work 
of reconstruction. There can, it seems to me, be but one answer 
to this question: if we are to have our common schools transformed 
there must be some school, the organization, work and inspiration 
of which particularly qualify it to do this work. The school must 
be so near at hand and its cost to the student so reasonable that 
the poorest boys and girls may be able to attend. In the average © 
county of the South there will be needed, while this educational 
transformation is taking place, not less than fifty new teachers 
each year for the common schools. 
Again, conditions in the South are such, the needs are so great in 
this new formative period, that we cannot wait on the schools for 
the beginning of this work of the regeneration of the life of the 
South. The many agencies which have been at work to bring the 
people to a realization of their conditions and needs have done 
well their tasks; the people have been well prepared for the recep- 
tion of new doctrine; we are ali agreed that the time is now at hand 
when some real constructive work should be done; we also know 
that people do not long remain in such a receptive attitude and 
that they will soon emerge from the present transition state to 
remain, as they have emerged, for years to come. What we need 
now is some place, convenient to the people, where skilled teachers, 
with all the needed resources, can give actual illustrations of all 
those processes and conditions which at the present time need to 
be transplanted into every home and every institution of the people. 
We need in every county a great high school, organized and 
equipped to do this work. The mission of this school should be to 
give life, and life more abundantly to the people. This school 
should receive neither its form, aims, nor inspirations from the tra- 
ditional high school; but it should be worked out in a scientific 
way to meet the twentieth century needs of the South. The doors 
should be ever open to the humblest citizen, who should be encour- 
aged to come to get the best instruction relating to the home, farm, 
general health, good citizenship, and, in fine, to all that goes not 
only to make him more effective as an individual, but also to cause 
him to appreciate his relationship to the social whole and to enable 
him to perform more intelligently those duties growing out of this 
relationship. Not only should the people be urged to come to the 
high school, but the high school should go to the people. Whether 
the problem should relate to the home, the farm, the school, the
-P-A-G-E-39
        JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 389 
church, or the civie unit, or be connected with any kind of legiti- 
mate work, whatever, the high school should be able to furnish an 
expert able to direct the people to a proper solution of it. 
Now comes the question: Can our present high schools, as they 
are organized and conducted, meet these demands? Have they 
done so in the past? These questions should be met with open 
minds. I realize that the least suggestion that the work of a per- 
son is not what it should be usually puts that person in a defensive 
position, with sword drawn. This attitude is fatal to the success- 
ful accomplishment of the great work in which we are engaged. 
The time is at hand when those who are engaged in the work of the 
South’s regeneration should be able to divest themselves of all pré- 
conceived opinions, all pride of work, in fine, of self. It is for us 
to review and criticise our own work as calmly and dispassionately 
as we would have the people to tear up and reconstruct their work. 
To do this is a condition precedent to the bringing about of the 
changes which almost all of us agree are needed in the South. We 
must first find salvation for ourselves before we can carry it to 
others. Our work, of necessity, is the source of that power which 
is needed for the redemption of the South. The extent to which 
these desired ends will be attained depends more upon the willing- 
ness and ability of the teachers of the South to reconstruct both 
their philosophy and their work than it does upon any other factor 
in the problem. 
Now, let us in this spirit examine our present high schools, to 
see if they are what they should be, or whether they should be recon- 
structed to meet the complex needs of this complex life. We all 
know the present high school of the South; therefore I am going to 
ask a series of questions, which I hope will stimulate some thought 
as to what changes are needed to be brought about in these schools 
to make them better fitted to perform more effectively their great 
functions. 
1. Are there a sufficient number of students in the high schools 
to meet the various demands from this source of supply under pres- 
ent conditions? If not, why not? 
2. Are the teachers of the high schools generally equipped by 
proper training to do effectively the work which it is the special 
province of the high schools to do? 
3. Is the subject-matter taught in the high schools so sufficiently 
comprehensive, so systematically organized, and so directly articu- 
lated with great life ends, as to make the student as socially effi- 
cient as he should be? 
   
-P-A-G-E-40
  40 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
4, Should the dual system of high schools that is fast develop- 
ing in the South be recognized as the ideal system? 
Many other questions could be asked; but these, in my opinion, 
will get the general question of efficiency of the high school before 
this body of teachers. 
I regret that reliable statistics of the number of students attend- 
ing high schools in the South cannot be obtained. I take it, how- 
ever, that conditions are practically the same in the different States 
of the South. For a number of years I have been closely connected 
with the high schools of Mississippi; during these years as high 
school teacher, State Superintendent of Education and college 
president, I have had the opportunity of seeing the high school 
problem from practically all angles. I believe I am safe in saying 
that not two per cent of the educable population of the South is in 
attendance in the high schools, and the number who finish the 
various high school courses is hardly large enough to state in terms 
of percentages. If we are to look to the high schools to get teach- 
ers for the elementary schools, we see at once that the supply is 
inadequate for this one need, even though every graduate of the high 
schools were to take up the work of teaching. But we neither 
expect nor desire that all the graduates of the high schools should 
become elementary school teachers. At least a respectable part 
of them should go to colleges and normal schools for better prepara- 
tion to fit them for teaching and other kinds of work. A large 
number of the high school graduates do not expect to adopt teach- 
ing as a life work; hence they go from the high school to the various 
activities of life, other than teaching. If well prepared teachers are 
in great demand, the call for intelligent leadership in various other 
kinds of work is equally insistent. The colleges are greatly hin- 
dered in their work by the insufficient preparation of the students 
who come to them from the high schools; and, as a result, many of 
them are doing high school work of which they should be relieved. 
Now, coming down to the individual high school, does the aver- 
age high school of the South have a sufficient number of students 
to justify it in offering the various courses of study, and in provid- 
ing laboratories for the various kinds of work so much needed, and 
in having a sufficient number of teachers to do this comprehensive 
work as it should be done? Almost all of our public high schools 
are but upper stories of elementary schools. In many of these 
so-called high schools there is only one teacher to give instruction 
in mathematics, science, language, history, etc., and to do the neces- 
sary laboratory work which ought to be done, but which is rarely
-P-A-G-E-41

attempted. It may be seen at a glance that the task is simply 
impossible for even two teachers and can be done only very poorly 
with three teachers. 
The natural result is that what is called high school work is 
merely the going over in a careless way the subject-matter of text- 
books without regard to the articulation of the various kinds of 
subject-matter taught, or its relation to great life ends. The knowl- 
edge gained cannot be transmuted, for no opportunity is given to 
the student to assimilate it by applying and testing it in the actual 
doing of it. Such subject-matter can have only an existence in the 
mind of the student and cannot be applied to the needs of society. 
Sometimes a county will support several high schools of this kind, 
when if all the resources expended for these several high schools 
were united, one real high school could hardly be supported. High 
schools with from twenty to fifty students cannot ordinarily have 
the resources necessary to maintain them as they should be, to sup- 
ply them either with proper teaching force or with that variety of 
subject-matter which should be taught in every real high school. 
If the number of students in the high schools is too few to meet 
the demands constantly made on them, and if the courses of study 
are too limited and the resources too small to furnish the necessary 
equipment and a sufficiently large number of teachers, what may be 
said in regard to the preparation of teachers for the work which 
ought to be done in the high schools at the present time? The 
teacher here, as elsewhere in education, is the dominant factor. 
The high school of today is but the incarnation of the teacher’s 
ideals, thoughts and philosophy, and these come from his education. 
With the exception of the industrial high schools, which have not 
been established for a time sufficient to test them, what does the 
work of the high school show as to the preparation of its teachers? 
The records show that a large per cent of the teachers of the 
high schools have had no other preparation for their work than has 
been afforded by the high schools themselves, the curriculums of 
which have been largely made up of the traditional branches 
which have been studied and recited in an abstract way without 
regard to their exemplification in laboratories or their relation to 
life ends. Much of this work, as is shown by the high school gradu- 
ates in colleges, has been done in a most careless manner. 
A very respectable part of the high school teachers have enjoyed 
college training, but in most cases this training has been of the old, 
abstract type. The teachers are earnest in work, but few have 
qualified themselves to do well those special kinds of work that

practically the entire educational world believes should be empha- 
sized at this time. The average high school teacher by his training 
has not been prepared to be a social leader. As a rule he is help- 
less when you take him out of his groove. Almost all high school 
work is given up wholly to the teaching of abstract and unrelated 
subject-matter, with the result that the longer he teaches, the farther 
he is getting away from those affairs and concerns which relate to 
the actual problems of life, and, instead of becoming more efficient 
socially as his professional experience increases, he is getting more 
and more out of touch with the practical things of life. I think 
I state a commonly accepted truth when I say that few people look 
to a teacher for advice and instruction when any of the practical 
problems of life are up for solution. 
But how about the subject-matter of our present school curricu- 
lum? Is it comprehensive, or limited in scope? Has it been organ- 
ized and articulated with the end in view of making the student 
socially efficient? Those who have had experience in admitting 
students to colleges on affiliated certificates from high schools have 
seen, I am sure, that the curriculums of our high schools are made 
up almost exclusively of Latin, English and mathematics. It is 
true that of late years history has gotten some foothold, but science 
has been and is still almost wholly neglected. Is it any wonder 
that many boys and girls, failing to get that in the high schools 
which they feel will prepare them for the various problems and 
duties of life, become discouraged and drop out? Our schools are 
still organized on the idea that the chief function of the school is to 
train the faculties; that the traditional subjects to a marked degree 
have the poser to give the student that general capacity that will 
enable him to accomplish any intellectual task; and that a subject 
may be used for years as a mind-training subject, and after having 
been so used may be dismissed from the mind without its having 
had any effect on the mind save to give it a power to accomplish 
tasks of any kind or character. In other words, no effort has been 
made to look beyond the curriculum. As to how this wonderful 
transformation is to take place, or whether it takes place at all, is 
no concern to the maker of the curriculum. He has absolute faith 
in the power of traditional subjects. His text for every sermon is, 
“Master ye first the traditional subjects, and then all things will 
be added unto you. ” I do not claim that any educational author- 
ity holds to any such view; but, unfortunately, very few of our high 
schools are regulated by students of the great subject of education.
-P-A-G-E-43
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 43 
The conception of a high schoo! which is held by almost all whose 
study and work entitle them to be respected as authorities on the 
subject of education, is that the purpose of education is to have the 
individual to realize his fullest possibilities for social service; that 
the end is not the curriculum, but a life developed to its maximum 
and dedicated to the service of the world. The people who hold this 
view would subordinate the curriculum to great life ends; they 
would see the children of the present the men and women of the 
future, performing the functions of life as they believe they should 
be performed in a Christian civilization. To these, all subject- 
matter should be used in a scientific way to accomplish this great 
end. The high school of today is lacking in this ideal; it does not 
concern itself with ends, neither are its processes scientific; in fact, 
possessing no end, outside of itself, it is impossible for the processes 
to be scientific; they have not been worked out rationally, but 
inherited as the heirlooms of tradition. 
A very little text-book matter relates to present-day problems; 
these schools are not in sympathy with the things with which the 
bodies, minds and hearts of the people have to grapple from early 
morning until late at night. If the teachers of these schools had 
the inclination, they are lacking in the ability to help the people 
solve their problems; hence there is a gulf between the people and 
the school. 
The high school of the future must develop an educational nerv- 
ous system that will penetrate every part of the body politic; it 
must immediately feel and meet every social need; it must concern 
itself with people and their interests as its chief right to exist at 
public expense. The high school teacher must see an improved state 
and an improved people as the very purpose of the existence of the 
high school. To accomplish this work the teacher must make him- 
self the possessor of that knowledge and that skill which will enable 
him both to render this service through the students he teaches and 
directly to the people when he has the opportunity to do so. ‘To 
accomplish this most comprehensive task requires not only properly 
trained teachers, but large resources. These resources cannot be 
provided if we are to continue the effort to keep up several high 
schools in each of our sparsely settled counties. 
The zeal manifested by the people of many of the localities of 
the South in making great sacrifices to maintain what all of them 
are pleased to dominate high schools is very much to be commended, 
whatever opinion one may have as to the judgment they exercise. 
In the weaker communities all interest and resources should be con-

centrated on a school whose work should be limited to eight years. 
When a people attempt to do more than their resources make it pos- 
sible for them to do well, it will be found that the work which they 
could do well is carelessly done. A good, well-organized, well-con- 
ducted school of eight years is of more real value to the people of 
a community than is a ten-grade school operated on resources only 
sufficient for the proper maintenance of a school of eight grades. 
In some cases, strong communities could add two additional years. 
The rule should be, first, to do well all that is attempted, and then 
attempt as much more as it is possible to do well. 
If this rule were rigidly followed, in a large majority of the 
counties of the South there would be only one high school for the 
county. We speak of the great need of the consolidation of the 
elementary schools; has not the time come when we should have a 
consolidation of the high schools of a county? Are we not so divid- 
ing our possible resources for high schools that they are being 
largely dissipated? Take an average county with one town of from 
fifteen hundred to twenty-five hundred population, and four or five 
other small towns and villages; practically all of these are attempt- 
ing to maintain high schools. Make a careful high school survey 
of the county. What number of students will you find in the high 
school departments of these schools? How many teachers are in 
each? What will you find in regard to the curriculums? Will 
anyone of them even approximate in any essential feature the work 
which ought to be done in a real high school? ‘Their work is not 
even developing in the direction of the ideal of the modern high 
school. The fundamental principle on which the school is estab- 
lished is wrong. The subject-matter is not chosen for the purpose 
of bringing the student into an intelligent contact with the prob- 
Jems of his existence, but relates to nothing definitely, and is made 
up almost wholly of abstractions, and these are not definitely com- 
prehended. Now why not take all the students and the resources 
of these five or six schools and put them into one central school 
where there will be adequate buildings, equipment and means for 
support; where a sufficient number of teachers, not only thoroughly 
trained in theory, but also skilled in laboratory, home and farm 
work, may be employed to teach all of the subject-matter that is 
needed to be known and practiced to make the student do for their 
counties and States all that is so much needed to be done at this 
time? Money cannot be obtained in the average county to have 
each of a half-dozen schools approximate this ideal. In counties 
where there is a town of five thousand or more inhabitants there 
could be two such schools.
-P-A-G-E-45
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 45 
In the establishment of such a central high school, the greatest 
care should be taken that in its location, organization and expense, 
the convenience of all the people of the county be well considered. 
Too often an inaccessible locality is chosen because of a large dona- 
tion offered for the location. This local donation is not to be 
despised, but it should never be the paramount influence in the loca- 
tion of a school. The school should be located with the idea that 
it is to be permanent, and the question of accessibility, health, 
expense, and all other necessary factors of a successful school 
should be given the most careful consideration. 
The county schools should be regulated by State law and con- 
trolled by a State board in all matters relating to general scope 
of work, regulation of expense, character of buildings and equip- 
ment, qualifications of teachers, and especially in the matter of 
requiring students to become skilled in the different kinds of work 
taken. A local board should manage the school in accordance with 
the State law and the general orders of the State Board. About 
two-thirds of the support of these schools and the cost of the plant 
should be born by the county; one-third of the support should come 
from the State. State support is justified by the idea that rail- 
roads have brought about an artificial distribution of the taxable 
wealth of the State. Property values of towns, including that of 
corporations, is determined by the location of railroads, and inland 
counties contribute to the wealth of these towns. Besides, it is to 
the interest of all the State that the citizens of every county be 
honest and intelligent, and possess the skill to make the most of 
their resources. The people of these remote counties elect legis- 
lators, governors, congressmen; they help make the general moral 
atmosphere of the State and pay State taxes on their property. 
Each of these schools should have a sufficiency of land for cam- 
pus, playground, pasture and field. The South is naturally an 
agricultural section. A great South which is not based on an intel- 
ligent agriculture is unthinkable. Agriculture must of necessity 
remain our principal industry. The rural South, whether we have 
regard to the farm, home, church, school, highways, business or 
general social life, is the supreme problem. To advance these 
various interests should be the one dominant purpose of these 
schools. Land is now relatively cheap in the South, and a sufficient 
amount for successful work in all these particulars should be pro- 
vided. 
The expense of these schools should be so regulated that all the 
aspiring boys and girls, it matters not how poor they may be, 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  46 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
should have the opportunity of attending them. This could be 
arranged by providing various kinds of profitable work which could 
be done by needy boys and girls. The farm itself should be so con- 
ducted as to use student labor with profit both to the school and 
to the student. Dairy work, cooking, house cleaning, floriculture, 
sewing, and many other opportunities could be provided whereby 
the girls could earn their way through school. All of this work 
could be so arranged as not only to provide the means necessary to 
sustain them in school, but also to contribute a real part in their 
education. Do not get the idea that I believe that there should be 
two distinct classes of students—those who work with their hands 
and those who do not work with their hands. I believe that all 
should do physical work every day as an essential part of their 
education. The only difference I should make would be to afford 
additional work to those who actually needed it. 
During the last few years there has been a growing lack of confi- 
dence in the old-time high school. The people are fast coming to 
the point where they do not believe that the high school of the past 
meets the demands of the present. As a result of this feeling, 
the different States of the South have provided another kind of high 
school, usually designated as “industrial schools.” These schools 
under various names are being fast established throughout the 
South, thus giving us a dual high school system. Is this wise? 
Have our people gone about correcting the high school situation in 
the right way? There seems to me to be many objections to this 
dual system. In the first place, it brings about a division of our 
resources, with the result that neither kind of school is able to real- 
ize even approximately its own ideal. Second, it has a tendency 
to bring about class distinctions in Southern life. The one would 
be largely composed of students pursuing principally the various 
forms of industry, while the other would offer its students almost 
exclusively classical studies. If this were continued for any length 
of time, it would soon be apparent that in every Southern county 
there would be two distinct classes of people, the one class believing 
that they were made up of a little better clay than those otherwise 
trained; the other feeling and resenting this arrogant assumption. 
This condition ought not to be. We should have our schools so 
broad in their scope as to meet the needs of every class of workers. 
Boys and girls from every class of society should be brought to- 
gether, each to get special training which will best prepare him for 
the life he is to live. Hach should come into actual contact with 
the problems of all the others—be familiar with the aims, struggles, 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. AT 
disappointments and realizations of every class of people—thus 
getting into sympathy with the lives of all with whom he must 
deal, and among whom he must live. Again, I hope that we will 
never develop the European system of having the son to follow the 
occupation of the father, as the dual system of schools would encour- 
age. If the son of a banker feels that he has a special aptitude 
for an agricultural life, he should have the opportunity to get the 
best preparation for this most important industry; on the other 
hand, if the son of the farmer is convinced that he has a genius for 
the banking house, the high school should afford him that training 
which would enable him to work with those who control the vast 
financial institutions of the country. This school should be so 
broad and have so little respect for the prejudices of the classes 
as to offer with equal opportunity all courses needed in the great 
civilization of the future which is possible for us of the South to 
realize. 
To educate a person properly means more than merely to fit him 
for a vocation. - The educated person should be a man or woman 
in every sense of the word; our preparation for work is only a part 
of ovr education. In all other respects, except vocational training, 
the education of people should be the same. At least four-fifths 
of the training of all the students should be the same in process, 
subject-matter and practice; hence there should be only a differen- 
tiation in the remaining one-fifth of their training. There is no 
reason why one school cannot do all of this work. There are many 
reasons why in a democracy our boys and girls of all classes of 
society should meet together in a great high school, where the high- 
est ideals of life are held up, each to get respect for the other, all 
to learn and appreciate the meaning of the true dignity of labor; 
all to catch step to the music of honesty, intelligence and consecra- 
tion to the effort to realize our best social ideals. 
I regret that lack of time prevents a full discussion of the all- 
important question of a suitable curriculum for these schools. 
The one thing more than all others that has caused the old high 
school to come into disrepute has been its narrow curriculum of 
unrelated subject-matter. The people generally have come to the 
conclusion that those things have not been taught in the old-time 
school which prepare the students to do intelligently life’s work 
and to perform life’s duties as they should be performed. They are 
therefore clamoring for a school that will adjust students to life; 
hence the rapid development of the industrial schools. The demand 
is for a school which will fit people to live well. In this new school 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  
  48 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
the thing to be kept constantly in view is the end to be attained and 
not the learning of the traditional subjects, it matters not how ven- 
erable and time-honored they may be. The studies are not to be 
the ends, but the means, and are not to be used because there is par- 
ticular virtue in their mastery, but because they contribute to the 
attainment of certain definite life ends. In other words, education is 
to be considered a definite, scientific process where certain definite 
ends are to be accomplished and subject-matter is to be used or 
rejected according to whether it has a direct influence in the attain- 
ment of these ends or not. Unless any particular subject consti- 
tutes a distinct link in the chain of causation it is not to be used. 
Before there can be an intelligent discussion of a curriculum 
from this standpoint, we must first get a definite view of the educa- 
tional product as we would like to have it; then we can proceed to 
construct the curriculum. I will now analyze this product and dis- 
cuss briefly each element. 
Individual and general health should be the first consideration 
among the ends of education, and the curriculum should contain all 
that worked-out and tested subject-matter which, if properly appre- 
hended, would result in giving a strong body, physical endurance, 
good physical habits, a knowledge of hygiene and sanitation, immu- 
nity from contagious and infectious diseases to all the students, and 
through them, to all the people. The physical being is the basis of 
everything. No quality or condition which we may desire or strive 
for can be considered apart from the physical self; intellectual 
attainments, self-control, dynamic usefulness of all kinds, happi- 
ness, temporal welfare, and, in fine, all ideals and accomplishments 
of necessity are limited by the physical self. The neglect of this 
all-important subject by the schools constitutes a great crime not 
only against civilization but against every individual that has been 
born since schools were established. We charge that war and pesti- 
lence are the great scourges of the human race, but these pale into 
insignificance when compared with the woe and misery that have 
resulted from the absolute neglect of giving instruction about the 
growth and care of the human body. It seems to me that the mere 
statement of a few uncontroverted facts would show that this state- 
ment is not an exaggeration. 
It has been estimated that measured by dollars (and this esti- 
mation gives only a slight idea of the enormity of the loss) the 
lowering in efficiency because of physical weakness of people who 
work in the United States has caused a loss of at least two billion 
dollars each year. Do you know of any one who is whole physic-
-P-A-G-E-49
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 49 
ally? Ask the first hundred people whom you meet how they feel, 
and over ninety per cent will give a qualified answer. Make the 
test yourself; can you ever approximate how much your general 
efficiency in thinking, feeling and acting is cut down because of 
physical deficiency? Considerably more money is spent each year 
for worthless patent medicines than there is spent for all forms of 
public education. Then think of the dollar-loss that results from 
the fact that forty-two per cent of the people who die ought not to 
die; of the immense loss that is occasioned by tuberculosis, typhoid 
fever and the many other lingering sicknesses—all more or less pre- 
ventable, if only we had been educated to prevent them. The num- 
ber of doctors, nurses, and drug stores in America constitute an 
exhibit of the stupendous folly of the schools’ devoting relatively iy 
much time to unimportant things and neglecting this important 
problem of life. What makes the tragedy more appalling is expe- 
rience has demonstrated that the body responds to educational influ- 
ences more readily than does any other part of the being. The time 
is near, I hope, when it will be considered a municipal and a family 
disgrace for these preventable diseases to prevail in the municipal- 
ity or in the home. 
Neat in order as an educational end in these schools should be w 
scientific study of the home; and there should be placed in the cur- 
riculum all that science has taught us in regard to the making and 
maintenance of the right kind of a home and home life. As in teach- 
ing health, there would be no election here. Every boy and girl 
would have to become automatically familiar with the fundamental 
principles of home-making; not merely the house, but every element, 
whether physical or spiritual, that goes into the making of the right 
kind of a home. The location of the home, planning of the home 
for physical convenience, comfort, home art and care and training 
of children, literature, relations of the members of the family, the 
attitude of the home to other institutions of society, and, in fine, 
every element that has to do with the home or home life should be 
scientifically presented and caused to be practiced until our boys 
and girls were so steeped in the philosophy and so skilled in the 
performance of everything appertaining to the home that they could 
not do otherwise than to make the right kind of homes when they 
become men and women. 
The home is the one great fundamental institution of human 
society. A strong home life gives perpetuity to government, stabil- 
ity to society and is the main prop of religion. I think in these 
schools the students should not live in large dormitories, but in 
4
-P-A-G-E-50
    50 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
homes organized and conducted according to the best theories that 
are taught in lecture rooms and laboratories. 
The making of the right kind of citizens should be regarded asi 
the next conscious end of education in these schools; and provision 
should be made in the curriculum for all that civic knowledge which 
the world has tested and upon which time has put the stamp of its 
approval, The political condition of the county is too well known 
to need any exposition at this time. While it has always been 
claimed that the chief function of the public schools was to train 
citizens, it is an admitted fact that the public schools have failed 
to meet the claims of its champions in this respect. For years edu- 
cation has been proclaimed the one panacea for all social ills, yet 
crime of all kinds and debauchery of every character were never so 
brazen in this country as they are today. A great many thoughtful 
people are asking the question: Is education a failure? I do not 
think that it is education that has failed, but that the school as we 
have had it has failed to educate. The writer some time ago was 
criticised for making the statement before a body of teachers that 
the schools are not educating for citizenship. He challenged the 
thirty teachers present to name one school where the making of 
citizens was not only one of the conscious ends of the school, but 
also where the instruction and training were ordered to the attain- 
ment of that end. The writer has not yet learned of the location 
of such a school. Can the school make good citizens? If some 
strong military power were to declare war against the United States 
and the President and Congress should get evidence that it was 
going to land a large army of invasion on the soil of the United 
States, such a wave of patriotic enthusiasm would sweep over the 
country that hundreds of thousands of men from every vocation, 
wholly ignorant and untrained in the duties of the soldier, would 
volunteer for the defense of their country. The government would 
establish at various points, camps of instruction taught by military 
experts, where the raw recruits could get the training and drill that 
would transform them into splendid soldiers. In a short time, by 
the regular study of military science and constant drill, the nation 
would have an army on which it could rely with confidence. 
Why in so short a time may adults be transformed from raw 
recruits to well-trained soldiers? The reason is simple. These 
schools would be organized under great stress for the purpose of 
accomplishing a definite end, and all subject-matter introduced and 
all drill would be arranged to give this definite result. Everything 
that is taught would be taught because it had a direct bearing on
-P-A-G-E-51
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 51 
the one end to be attained. In short, the work would be scientific. 
If it is possible to take men grown in body, developed in mind and 
fixed in habits and in a short time transform them in a definite 
way, is it not much easier to take children who are not crystallized 
in any particular and by a series of years of study and training 
cause them to become the intelligent, honest and skilled soldiers of 
peace? We have war occasionally, the contest for the social weal 
and civic righteousness, and the fight against crime and ignorance 
should never end. We need a patriotism of peace as much as a 
patriotism of war. The civic wrongs will never be righted by laws; 
the great civic problems will never be solved by mere agitation. 
These, and many other things we so much desire, will come only 
when we have a generation of people trained to do the necessary 
work. Every public school of the South should be a camp for the 
training of citizens, the making of citizens, not merely the studying 
about citizenship. Certainly one of the dominant ends of these 
schools should be to lead all the boys and girls into the full knowl- 
edge and conduct of good citizenship. 
Let this end be as definite, the subject-matter as logically related 
to the end, the processes as scientific, and the drill as well related to 
the theory and as constant, and the school will be as successful in 
turning out good citizens as is the military camp of instruction in 
turning out good soldiers. It is here, as in all other purposes of the 
high school, the end must be kept constantly in view and all subject- 
matter and every process must be so selected and arranged ag to 
necessarily and logically lead to this end. Good voting, honest and 
intelligent jury service, combating preventable diseases, the making 
of highways, the care of the indigent, the draining of swamp lands, 
questions of taxation, regulation of banks and insurance, general 
laws, and, in fine, every civic problem, duty and responsibility of 
any kind and character of direct interest to the people should not 
only be taught in theory, but, as at the military camp, should be so 
woven into the individual fabric that each student will become auto- 
matically adjusted to every civic duty. Let me emphasize the 
necessity of first giving instruction in these civic problems which 
are directly connected with the welfare and happiness of the people 
of the county in which the school is located. This should be done 
first because the larger part of the lives of the students will be spent 
amid local conditions; and second, because it is the natural and 
psychological method of studying the civic and social problems of 
the world. Our present-day schools stress too much the remote and 
inaccessible things; let us commence with the things immediately

around us and then by constantly associating the more remote to 
the nearer, extend our knowledge until it embraces the wide world, 
and, if need be, the known universe. 
As the effort to procure food, shelter and clothing for the average 
person requires the largest part of his waking hours, one of the 
chief ends to be attained in the high school should be the teaching of 
the various forms of industry suited to the county in which the 
school is located. There should be put into the curriculum that sys- 
tematized knowledge which directly relates to preparation for the 
various occupations. 
In the teaching of health, home and citizenship there would be 
no distinction based on individual aptitude; all these would be with- 
out election for all the students. But when we come to the voca- 
tional end we should have the widest election. Until the common 
schools offer that variety of vocational instruction in such a manner 
as will reveal the students’ aptitudes to himself, the student, during 
the first year, should pursue the various forms of industry in order 
to get a clear idea of his vocational aptitude. After that, I should 
gradually narrow the field, and during the last year should have 
the student to specialize on one vocational subject. The many high 
school graduates who will become teachers should have that prac- 
tical knowledge of the various kinds of occupations essential to 
the welfare of the people of his county in order that the subject of 
vocation generally may be intelligently handled by them in the 
common schools; this study of general vocation is of the utmost 
importance, because it affords one of the logical ways of getting a 
full and definite stock of sense knowledge, which is the essential 
basis of a person’s education, and at the same time is a limitation 
upon a person’s achievements in all lines; and such a study of voca- 
tion is further justified by the fact that it gives the student an 
opportunity to discover his vocational aptitude. 
Industrial education in some form should be especially empha- 
sized for all students, without reference to the various callings they 
are to follow, because the health and general equilibrium of all 
parts of the whole being is impossible unless the muscles and mind 
are cobrdinated every day in some useful work. As to the kinds of 
vocational instruction that should be offered, this question should 
be determined by the needs of the county. As agriculture is always 
to be the industry followed by the great majority of the people of 
the South, every phase of the subject should be expertly taught and 
continually practiced by those who expect to follow it. Not only the 
field, but every necessary phase of farm life should receive the most
-P-A-G-E-53
    
         JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 53 
careful attention. Shop work of various kinds should be given to 
those who wish to qualify themselves to be mechanics and artisans 
of various kinds; the elements of manufacture should also receive 
attention; the business side of life should be carefully considered, 
especially that form of business connected with the preparation of 
farm products, their transportation and sale. It matters not 
whether a student would wish to be a farmer, teacher, lawyer, 
artisan, banker, merchant, preacher, or what not, such student 
should get instruction and training which at least would serve as a 
basis for future preparation for his work. As for the girls—they 
should concentrate on teaching and house work; though some atten- 
tion should be given to stenography, millinery and other vocations 
that women sometimes have to follow. 
There are some things that cannot be classified and studied scien- 
tifically. Every one should have some time each day which he may 
use as his fancy dictates. How properly to use leisure time is a 
problem too important to be neglected. A portion of every day 
should be given to play, social intercourse, general reading, music 
or other interesting and refining occupations. The one thing to 
be kept always in mind is that the students have such opportuni- 
ties in these things as will cause them to desire and love the best. 
I would have no formal study here, but merely make the conditions 
and restrictions such that that which is noblest and best should 
always be appealed to with the purpose that the student would 
gradually get adjusted to the better things of life, that he would 
naturally discriminate the good from the bad and automatically 
respond to the good. 
Man is a religious being, and as a culmination of the whole curric- 
ulum, I should give the opportunity for the student to learn those 
things which would bring him into the right attitude to the Creator 
of the universe. Not creed, nor doctrine as popularly understood, but 
to know God and to fashion a life in sympathy with His great plan ; 
not merely to profess, but to do His will! I should make practical 
religion the capstone of a young man’s or a young woman’s prepara- 
tion for life. 
Such a school will cost money; but can one conceive of money so 
well invested? If we can only take generation after generation of 
the children as they follow each other on the stage of life, give all 
the individuals of each, health, knowledge, skill to use automatic- 
ally knowledge rightly for self and the public weal, the inspiration 
for high ideals and unselfish service, a knowledge of God and a 
desire to serve Him, we can then say that we have a truly cultured 
people—the attainment of the supreme end of education.

Presipent WHITFIELD, Chairman: Ladies and Gentlemen, I take 
pleasure in introducing to you Dr. E. E. Rall, Professor of Education 
in the University of Tennessee, from Knoxville, who will now 
address you. 
Dr. Rati: Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen—The President 
of your Association asked me to speak on the topic found in the pro- 
gram, “A False Educational Basis and Some of Its Ills,” and to 
direct some body-blows at the dogma of formal discipline as the source 
of many of our educational ills. I am, however, taking the liberty 
of not obeying the President. I know that I am taking my life in 
my hands (laughter), but perhaps before I am through I may say 
something about the formal disciplinarians that may gain me some 
measure of presidential clemency. 
Dr. Rall’s address follows: 
EpucatioNaL CrivicisM. 
BE. E. RALL, UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
My first proposition is that most criticism of the schools is untrust- 
worthy, exaggerated, or misleading, and that this is due in large part 
to the following causes: 
In the first place many critics oversimplify the problems of educa- 
tion. Teaching school, saving the country politically, bringing up 
babies, curing rheumatism, are all such extremely simple problems 
that they offer no difficulties to the ordinary soap-box philosopher of 
the country cross-roads store, or to the hysterical critics of the 
journals designed for feminine domestic consumption. (Laughter.) 
And so, multiplied critics of the schools have arisen competent in 
their own eyes to pass judgment on so simple a thing and one so 
familiar as our “common schools,” for they have not been “through” 
the schools themselves, or do they not have children who are in the 
schools now? It would not do, of course, to suggest that many of 
us have, for example, spent many hours in a dentist’s chair with most 
vivid memories of the proceedings, and yet we scarcely claim to be 
made competent critics of modern dentistry; or that others of us 
have had, unfortunately, perhaps, experience with lawyers without, 
however, becoming thereby authorities on the intricacies of modern 
legal practice. Our critics, nevertheless, claim credence because 
they speak from “experience.” But it is amazing how varied that 
experience may be, how differently the same experience may be viewed 
especially when seen through the perspective of years. Take the     
  
-P-A-G-E-55
       JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 55 
schooling of our childhood days. How idealized it becomes for some! 
How “de-idolized” it becomes for others! Perhaps the color of the 
critic’s glasses has some effect upon the hue with which the landscape 
seems o’ercast. 
But many critics also claim to speak from “observation.” They 
point with convincing fingers to the product of the schools, to the 
character of the students, to the contents of the curriculum. And 
what they show us is largely determined by what they are trying to 
prove. We are likely to have pointed out to us the overworked child 
or the under-worked child; the over-disciplined or the under-dis- 
ciplined generation; the impractical or the too-practical education 
of today. And you are liable to have unpleasant remarks made if 
you mildly suggest that men usually see what they expect to see, or 
what they want to see, and that among a great variety of facts, by 
selecting the right ones (that is, those that support one’s contentions) 
and neglecting all others, almost any proposition may be “proven” to 
the satisfaction, at least, of the proposer. There is thus great danger 
of judging from one’s experience alone. 
There is also danger of basing conclusions on too few cases drawn 
from the experience of others. And often, too, the cases cited are not 
typical or representative. For there is an inevitable tendency to be 
attracted by the more noticeable and more interesting exception than 
by the commonplace average individual or instance. Should any 
would-be student of nature rashly declare that one swallow makes a 
spring, he would promptly and properly be branded as a nature-fakir. 
For not only is it true that one swallow does not make a spring, but 
the presence of a single swallow is more likely to preve that it is still 
winter. Is it not possible that the schools suffer at times from such 
education-fakirs who, in similar manner, would make the rule from 
the exception? 
At the outset, therefore, we should be prepared to find much crit- 
icism arising from too narrow or one-sided observation. We should 
expect it to be determined by the prejudice or preconception of the 
individual critic and by the angle from which his particular position 
in life compels him to view education. 
I desire in the next place to consider briefly three typical classes. 
of critics and to notice how these furnish illustrations of the points 
just made. 
First, there.is the criticism of the conservatives. Its general form 
is too well known to require detailed presentation. A brief state- 
ment will suffice. Modern education fails to discipline, to train the 
faculties, to give accuracy, power of judgment and reason. We give
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
a smattering of everything, thorough mastery of nothing. Energy is 
dissipated, pupils are amused instead of being made to work, while the 
public demands that everything taught shall possess immediate dollars 
and cents value. 
The cure of these ills must be sought, our critics tell us, in a return 
to the simple, compact, thought-provoking, work-compelling curricu- 
lum of the older day, with the classics and mathematics as the heart 
and center of the course. Only thus can our schools hope to produce 
again the intellectual giants which were the product of the old regime. 
In fact, this training fits the boy better for any field of life or labor 
than does a specialized training intended to prepare directly and 
practically for such particular occupation. 
What shall be our reply to these charges? We cannot deny that 
they are widespread and often reiterated. That they contain a 
measure of truth which we would do well to heed is probably true. 
Americans have the speed mania, the get-rich-quick obsession, and 
naturally it is reflected in our schools. We want immediate results 
in education, as elsewhere; we are impatient of the slow and long- 
circuited route along which alone any full development and true edu- 
cation is to be found. Nature has made this lesson plain, if only we 
would heed it. She has given man a period of infancy longer than 
that of any other species—an infancy equal in length to one-half the 
total adult life. Not only is man’s infancy the longest, it is also the 
most helpless and the most plastic, and in these facts is found the best 
justification of education. Upon those who would use this period 
for other purposes by prematurely taking up the duties of adult life, 
she visits severe punishment, as anyone may be convinced who sees 
the child-laborers of our streets and factories. 
The lesson of honest and efficient effort in all school work we also 
need to learn more perfectly. I do not say, however, the lessons of 
“hard work and thoroughness,” for our critics are inclined to see 
virtue in mere hardness or difficulty and to advocate studies on such 
grounds, while thoroughness has too often been given its literal mean- 
ing of “going through” a task or a course quite neglectful of the 
place to which it leads. Our aim should be, instead, to make educa- 
tion arrive somewhere and attain some end, an end set up by the 
teacher, discernable and desired by the pupil, and of value to 
society. There is no virtue in hardness per se, or in difficulty per se. 
The virtue lies in the nature of the interest which calls the effort 
forth, in the attitude of the student toward his work, and in the 
nature of the returns from that effort both to the child and to 
society.   
-P-A-G-E-57
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 57 
That this type of criticism is so widespread is not necessarily proof 
that it is correct. In their day there was a most widespread criti- 
cism of Copernicus, of Galileo, of Darwin, and of many others; but 
that is not proof that their teachings were in error. It is in large 
part but an instance of the conservative nature of men and the power 
of tradition combating all that is new. 
The doctrine of formal discipline or of general mental training, 
though largely discredited, still offers chief support to these critics, in 
their claims for supreme value of classical and mathematical studies. 
Again, these critics are sometimes victims of the fallacy of judging 
others by themselves. Usually they represent the ablest and the 
highest product of the old-time school, and are engaged in pursuits 
for which their classical training has especially fitted them, and thus 
they are liable to assume that others have like capacities and like 
needs and would receive like profit from like training. 
One other argument of these critics I must briefly consider, namely, 
that the classical course constitutes the best preparation for all, even 
for those who enter scientific or practical life, because their best stu- 
dents come from classical schools. But instead of it being true that 
they possess superior. ability because they have attended classical 
schools, it would probably be nearer the truth to say that they attend 
the classical schools because they possess superior ability. For 
certainly in the past, and to a large extent today, those who possess 
the greatest capacity for higher studies are sent to the classical 
schools. Nature may deserve the credit, therefore, rather than the 
classics. 
In leaving these critics, shall we not agree, at least, to this: for 
some minds and for some pursuits a strictly classical training is best, 
for others a scientific training is best, for others and by far the largest 
number, those for whom the high school must also take the place of 
the college, a broader training than either of these is the best? To 
be adequate, such training must, I believe, include at least these four 
essentials: (1) education for health and physical efficiency, (2) spe- 
cific preparation for a vocation, (3) training in citizenship, rather 
than teaching about citizenship, and (4) education for culture and 
social service. 
The second criticism I wish to take up is that of the so-called 
“practical” men who view education from the angle of their own 
business. . 
Their first criticism is the time-honored, ever-present one that the 
schools teach so many things that no time is left for the “essentials,” 
meaning the three R.’s, and as a result our pupils cannot spell or 
write or cipher. And so we are asked to abolish such “fads and
-P-A-G-E-58
    58 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
frills” as drawing, music, manual training, domestic science and the 
rest, and give more time to the three R.’s. The schools of the earlier 
day furnished better training in these subjects, and they did so 
because of the absence of the many new subjects. 
In meeting this criticism, let us first consider the question of fact 
involved. Are our schools less efficient in teaching the three R.’s 
than those of a former day? A chorus of sorely-tried business men 
answers “yes,” but I believe they are wrong. And, because it fur- 
nishes such a good illustration of the point I tried to make earlier, 
that individual experience and uncritical observation is liable to error 
and may even by judging by exceptions give conclusions contrary to 
fact, I want to call attention to some interesting studies made a few 
years ago and familiar to students of education. I refer to the so- 
called Springfield Tests and to the Norwich Tests.* 
I give below a summary of the results obtained in Springfield, 
Mass., and in twenty-one Texas cities where the same tests were given 
in 1909, and also the results for an independent and different set of 
tests in Norwich, Conn. Examination questions and papers of stu- 
dents of an earlier day were found, and the same questions given to 
the same grades of present-day students, and the results were com- 
pared. The tables show that in every investigation, for every subject 
and with conditions of the tests all favoring the students of the 
earlier day, the students of today are far superior in the so-called 
essentials of spelling, arithmetic, geography, penmanship, grammar 
and history:

Let us, therefore, not accept as conclusive the mere ipse diwit of a 
business man, or of a thousand business men, to the contrary; for I 
believe that these facts must convince any fairminded judge that our 
schools, with all their new subjects, teach the three R.’s far more 
efficiently than the school of a former generation. Instead of these 
newer subjects being the cause of poorer teaching in the formal 
studies, I believe that by their vitalizing touch, by their tendency to 
connect the school with life, and by the added interest they have 
suffused over the whole curriculum, they have really been the cause, 
in large measure, of the decided improvement shown. 
We will readily grant to these critics, however, that the product of 
our schools is by no means perfect, and that we can and should better 
the teaching of the three R.’s._ But this improvement will not come 
by a return to the past, but by supplying better trained teachers, by 
continued improvement in methods, and especially by more liberal 
financial support of the schools so that, for example, one grade teacher 
need not try to teach 75 or 60 or even 40 pupils, nor a high school 
teacher be required to teach every hour in the day, as many must at 
present. (Applause.) 
The third criticism to which I wish to call your attention comes 
also from the business and industrial world, but, unlike the preced- 
ing, I fear it has more justification. 
I refer to the complaint that our schools do not provide training 
for vocation. Nine-tenths of our high school graduates do not go to 
college, and for these our courses fail to furnish the training that will 
fit them for their life work. Schools do not connect with life; 
instead, they educate away from the farm, the shop, the trades, leading 
to an overcrowding of the learned professions, and causing the ranks 
of our workmen, both skilled and unskilled, where they are not 
recruited from foreign countries, to be filled with the ignorant and 
untrained. The remedy proposed is to give to all the work of the 
school a vocational coloring and direction, to provide specific training 
in the high school and possibly in the last two years of the elementary 
school, for those vocations which predominate in the community.  
-P-A-G-E-60
  60 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
This means, for the South at least, first of all, agricultural education. 
But for our cities it also means commercial and industrial courses of 
many kinds. 
Fortunately, our schools have awakened to the force of these crit- 
icisms and are trying to meet them. Time and much wisdom and 
care will be needed, however, that our new enthusiasm shall not carry 
us too far. A word of warning which others have raised will bear 
repeating here. Vocational training is only one aim, and must in all 
cases constitute only one part of the work of our public schools, only 
one element among a number that must enter into the education of 
each child. The narrowly practical, the exclusively vocational train- 
ing is surely worse than the other extreme, the exclusively classical 
training. We must turn out efficient workers, but also more than 
workers. 
Again, the training for agriculture or the trades should not each 
be set off in a school by itself separated from the school that gives the 
academic and college preparatory training. Even though this may 
be desirable in the cities on the grounds of economy, it would, I 
believe, conduce to class distinctions and to narrowing of the educa- 
tion of each group. The American public school must remain what 
it has always been, the greatest democratizing and unifying force in 
society. 
Within the vocational courses themselves, moreover, there is danger 
of following narrow, rule-of-thumb methods, of considering too 
exclusively the practical applications without underlying principles—- 
in short, of furnishing instruction merely, and not education. Agri- 
cultural subjects, for example, can and must be made truly educative. 
This, of course, means improved and adequate text-books, better 
methods of teaching, broader treatment of all phases of life as it 
touches the vocation in question, and effective correlation with all 
other parts of the curriculum. 
To solve all these problems of vocational education will take time, 
and patience, and study, increased financial support, and in particular 
a closer association of the school with the industries, of teachers with 
the men in industrial, commercial, and agricultural life. And so we 
shall have to ask of these critics patience to wait fifty years, perhaps, 
before we can develop in this country the right sort of vocational 
education with the right sort of teachers, text-books, and methods. 
T have suggested a few of the reasons why I believe critics of educa- 
tion are liable to err, and I have mentioned a few of the criticisms that 
they bring against the schools, and I have tried to show in each case 
how far they are justifiable.   
-P-A-G-E-61
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 61 
What, in general, shall be the attitude of the teacher toward edu- 
cational criticism, especially that coming from without? _ 
There are two things to be said here that we who are teaching must 
never forget: (1) The teacher is a public servant, and the public, 
therefore, has the right to investigate, to know, to criticise all that we 
do. Instead of being over-sensitive to criticism, we need to face it 
squarely, whether just or not, and where it arises from ignorance that 
it lies within our power to dispel, we owe it to the public and to the 
schools to furnish the necessary facts. (2) Teachers need and should 
welcome proper criticism. The teacher deals with immature minds, 
with those who accept without question whatever the teacher presents, 
and so arises the tendency to become dogmatic, uncritical, blind to 
imperfections. We teachers, in other words, do not perform our 
work among our equals, or in the presence of our fellows, as does the 
lawyer, the preacher, or the doctor, and so we lose the benefit of 
intelligent criticisms, of seeing our fellow-craftsmen at work and of 
getting thereby better standards for judging our own work. All this 
should make us welcome criticism if only it be of the right sort. 
And this leads me to suggest, in conclusion, the two conditions 
that must be met if any educational criticism is to be sane, sound, and 
helpful, whether the critic be within or without the teaching pro- 
fession : 
(1) We must see education, in Matthew Arnold’s phrase, “steadily 
and see it whole.” We must have a broad enough and sound enough 
philosophy of education. We must have a clear, definite and ade- 
quate conception of the goal or ideal that education is to strive to 
attain. It must not overlook any part of human life, and any subor- 
dinate aim, whether it be health, or economic efficiency, or happiness, 
or social efficiency, must take its place alongside the others without 
one usurping the place of another. Likewise we must see the public 
school system as it constitutes a part of the larger whole of our 
modern American civilization. It should not be demanded of one 
institution that it do the work of another. 
(2) We must take the attitude and follow the method of science. 
Seek for facts, search for them patiently and persistently, and follow 
where they lead, whether the truth be pleasant or unpleasant, destruct- 
ive of cherished traditions or not. 
Education suffers from the reign of opinion, from the guidance of 
vague theories and uncritical observation. Its field is large and its 
data perhaps the most complex of any science, but that should not 
discourage us from facing the situation and helping those who have 
made a start in the scientific study of our problems and adding our  
-P-A-G-E-62
  62 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
share, however small, of positive contributions to the knowledge of 
our craft. 
When educational criticism is based on this double foundation of 
sound theory and established fact, we may expect it to become, what 
criticism in any field should be, sincere and disinterested, intelligent, 
and constructive. Let us hope that the day of this kind of criticism 
in the field of education may speedily come. (Applause.) 
Presipent Wairrierp: Dr. William Dinwiddie is absent this 
evening. He will be here in the morning. 
Dr. Wuitrietp: We have with us tonight a gentleman who has 
done much toward improving the health of the people of his own 
State, and he has brought his Health Exhibit Car to Louisville. I 
am going to present Dr. Dowling, of the Louisiana State Board of 
Health, who will explain his exhibit and extend an invitation to the 
teachers and citizens of Louisville to see his exhibit. Dr. Dowling 
has even made New Orleans healthy. (Applause.) 
Dr. Dowxine: I am glad to have this opportunity of speaking to 
you. No one appreciates more than the State of Louisiana the work 
that is being done there in that State, from which the car started in 
December, 1910. We have had with us a representative of the Edu- 
cational Department. 
We know the best way to reach the people is through the children, 
as they are the men and women of tomorrow, so we have tried to 
instill into the children the way they should live. We have appealed 
to them to aid us along different lines, and on 256 occasions we have 
appealed to the teachers to aid us by giving the necessary instructions 
to the children, when we had reasons to believe that the children had 
not been properly taught in the ways in which they should live 
morally. By this means we told them the things they should know. 
We believe that gonorrhea and syphilis should be understood, and we 
think many cases, at least, can be avoided by proper instruction of 
the children on these vital subjects. We want in Louisiana an 
increased aristocracy—an aristocracy built upon good, red blood. 
We want clean fathers and clean mothers for the coming generations. 
We want men to live clean lives, men who will live with only one 
woman—and that woman his wife—and love her alone through life 
just as he loved her when the minister pronounced them husband and 
wife. 
School teachers are poorly paid; but we hope the time is not far 
distant when they may enjoy an increase in their salaries. Some 
months ago I was present in a banking institution when a teacher 
 
-P-A-G-E-63

presented her check. It was the first one she had ever received. The 
teller told her he was sorry, indeed, to have to give her such dirty 
bills, because there might be bacteria in them. She told him not to 
be at all alarmed, because no bacteria could live on her salary. 
(Laughter. ) 
In reference to the bacteria brought into Louisiana and Missis- 
sippi by the overflow of the Mississippi River, I heard a discussion 
between three men. Two of them, one of whom was an Irishman, 
were walking along the street when they met a school teacher. One 
of the men asked the teacher: “What is this bacteria they talk so 
much about?” The teacher answered: “You see where that water 
is backed in there? Well, that’s what it means.” Then he asked: “If 
you should go across the water and should find this in Germany, 
what would it be then?” “Germs.” “What would it be in France?” 
“Parasites.” Just then Mike spoke up: “Faith and begorra, phwat 
would it be if it happened in Ireland?” “Microbes.” (Laughter.) 
I am sorry the car cannot stay tomorrow. We kept it here today, 
but the schedule makes it impossible for us to remain longer than 
today. If you come to Louisiana, we shall be delighted to show it 
to you, glad to take you into the country and show you the effort 
that is being put forth. I am not going to detain you. We will 
show you the improvement made in our schools. We have in one 
little town a consolidated school costing $16,000, and in that school 
there are something over 500 children attending regularly. I hope 
ere long we may invite you to Louisiana, the land of orange blossoms. 
(Applause. ) 
Surr. E. O. Hotranp: The Child Welfare Exhibit, which is being 
given at the Armory, Walnut and Sixth Streets, is not going to leave 
tomorrow. It will continue until Saturday night at ten o’clock. 
The leading men and women of the city have been working for over 
a year to show the people of the city what is being done in Kentucky 
and Louisville for the child, what is not being done in Kentucky and 
Louisville for the child, and what ought to be done in this city and 
State for the child. At the expense of about six or seven thousand 
dollars, and an immense amount of time and effort, the ladies and 
gentlemen of this city and State have succeeded in producing a splen- 
did exhibit. They have long been working on this problem, 
and they have an interesting story to present to you on all phases of 
life that affect the child. The Armory is two blocks west of the 
Seelbach Hotel, where your headquarters are located. They have 
model teaching, or, at least, sample teaching, which will doubtless 
prove interesting to you. There will also be an exhibit of the work

being done in domestic science, manual training, kindergarten work, 
primary work, and some work in the upper grades. The teaching is 
done between the hours of two and five in the afternoon and seven and 
nine in the evening. The time of the Child Welfare Exhibit was 
changed so that it would be on exhibition during your meeting. You 
are cordially invited to attend. Tell your friends about it. There 
is no charge for admission. 
Dr. Wurtrimip: This exhibit is worth the trip to Louisville. I 
hope you will attend it. 
Adjourned until Friday morning. 
FRIDAY MORNING. 
The meeting was called to order by Dr. Whitfield, who presided as 
chairman over all general meetings of the Association. 
Dr. Wuitrietp: Ladies and Gentlemen—I certainly regret to 
introduce to this very small audience a man who has done such won- 
derful work along educational lines—a man of such enthusiasm, a 
man of such energy and brilliancy as he whom I am about to present 
to you—but I am sure what this audience lacks in quantity is more 
than offset by its quality, so I am going to introduce to you Mr. W. H. 
Hand, State High School Inspector, Columbia, South Carolina. His 
subject is, “The Citizen versus the Knowledge of Citizenship.” 
Mr. Hann: Ladies and Gentlemen—We have all heard of the 
unfortunate situation of being sandwiched “between the devil and the 
deep blue sea.” I mention the name of His Satanic Majesty with 
reverence in this presence. Well, I have been occupying that unen- 
viable position. I am between the “devil” of the print shop and the 
President of this Association. If you will look on your program, you 
will find something that puzzles me and has worried me not a little. 
It is three letters before my name. I never even aspired in that 
direction. (Laughter.) There is the “devil” side of the question. 
Now, the President side is that the President assigned me a subject 
several days ago, and then made my speech last night for me, so I am 
sure I occupy an unenviable position, geographically speaking. 
(Laughter. )

to some country, to some government, is a necessary preventive 
against the various types and shades of anarchy. The patriotic 
alien in any country either clings tenaciously to the land of his birth 
or casts his lot unreservedly with the people of his adopted country. 
He feels the necessity of anchoring himself by means of allegiance to 
some organized government, of becoming a citizen of some country. 
The American-born boy and girl look forward with eager anticipation 
to the time of their majority, when they are to attain to the full 
stature of American citizenship. 
Citizenship in America means more than it does in most other 
countries, because it confers upon the citizen more privileges and 
greater freedom than are conferred by most other countries. This 
statement is not empty rhetoric. Anyone at all familiar with modern 
governments will accept the statement unchallenged. So generally 
is the truth understood that America has become the Mecca and an 
asylum to the oppressed people of all lands. This very fact has laid 
at our doors a national problem of tremendous import. 
The status of the American citizen, native or naturalized, is simple 
and well-defined. The privileges and the freedom of the citizen are 
easily understood, the power of the government is fully recognized, 
_and the protection it affords is appreciated. Almost any American 
schoolboy who has passed through the elementary school can give you 
a fair definition of a citizen, can state in outline the legal requisites 
and the legal rights of a citizen, and can tell you the steps necessary 
for a foreigner to become an American citizen. 
Now, privileges and freedom bestowed upon the citizen carry with 
them corresponding obligations and responsibilities. The more 
prodigal the freedom the heavier the responsibilities and the more 
exacting the service. The question naturally arises: Is the term 
citizenship as clearly defined, and is its significance as well understood 
as the term citizen? Is it not true that many men regard citizenship 
as something very impersonal and something altogether passive? 
There is in every community a group of men usually called good 
citizens, who never in their lives made a conscious effort to render any 
service to the welfare of the State. They may be very good men, in 
a passive way, but they are poor citizens. 
Good citizenship, if I may dare define it, embraces a comprehensive 
knowledge of our fundamental institutions and what they stand for, 
a sympathetic knowledge of men, a genuine love of truth, and a read- 
iness for active service in the promotion of the welfare of society. « 
Good citizenship is genuine patriotism. Few words, if any, strike 
home to the hearts of a liberty-loving and justice-loving people more 
oO  
-P-A-G-E-66

than does the word “patriot.” _All the fraternal feeling and interest 
and sympathy and willingness to sacrifice that exist in the human 
race have been focused in the one word, patriotism, the love of country 
and all that goes toward making it. How strange it is that it has 
come about that we think so little of the patriot and patriotism, save 
in connection with great crises in national life! How little the 
average man seems to think of these terms in the every-day political, 
social, and commercial life of a people! Few men seem to stop to 
think how much genuine patriotism is necessary to good citizenship 
in times of peace. 
Was there ever a time in all human history when patriotism, good 
citizenship, was more sorely needed than in our land today? True 
it is that no great army of soldiers is threatening to invade our land. 
True it is that no mighty power is marshaling its forces to invest 
our shores. But there are grave questions in our very midst which 
call for all the wisdom and patience and patriotism that we can 
command. It is no exaggeration to say that the very foundations 
of our commercial organism, governmental structure, and social order 
are being put to severe tests. At intervals, all too frequent, a spirit 
of anarchy takes possession of first one, then another of them. We 
have unjust and unrighteous combinations of capital which cheapen 
labor and increase the cost of living for the sole purpose of swelling 
the phenomenal fortunes of individuals whose God is greed and whose 
gospel is to grind the helpless. We all have seen the small producer 
and the small manufacturer driven to the wall by the greed and 
selfishness of wealth and combined opulence. We are familiar with 
the suffering that often comes to thousands of persons from blind 
persistence in a labor strike ordered and led to gratify the ambition 
of some fanatical labor agitator, who has not done a day’s manual toil 
in ten years. _ Too, we have seen thousands of dollars’ worth of 
private property destroyed at the hands of an unreasonable mob, com- 
posed of men and women whose means of living had but yesterday 
come from the property that they have now destroyed. Even as we 
sit here in this hall a great trial is slowly bringing to light a scheme 
of truly national proportions to force capital and independent labor 
to accept the terms of organized labor or arbitration by dynamite. 
With all this, there has come to the masses of the people a distrust of 
the entire commercial world, from the Standard Oil Company down 
to the peanut vender on the street. Any kind of corporation or 
combination whose object is economy—economy of capital, economy 
of labor, or economy of product—is a benefit and a blessing; any 
other kind is inimical to a free people.

Does the intelligent citizen realize his personal obligations to 
society in his ordinary business transactions? Does he in his busi- 
ness dealings recognize the Golden Rule of Holy Writ, or that of the 
commercial shark which says: “Do the other fellow before he can 
do you”? How do short weights, adulterated goods, unsound horses, 
and wet cotton square with good citizenship? An all too common 
notion of good citizenship and business thrift is illustrated in the 
laconic dialogue between a pious Puritan merchant and his errand 
boy: 
Said the merchant: “John, have you watered the vinegar?” “Yes, 
sir.” “Have you sanded the sugar?” “Yes, sir.” “Well, come in to 
prayers.” 
In the political world even worse conditions are found. The 
dignity and majesty of the law are set at defiance, courts of justice 
are paralyzed, and even the temples of justice are profaned. Even 
those who have been selected to enforce law and to preserve order are 
frequently found guilty of prostituting their sacred trust to the most 
sordid ends and even to the most criminal practices. Such cases as 
have recently come to light in New York City would be disgraceful 
to savages. The spoils system in American politics has done more 
to poison the springs of national integrity than any other one agency. 
It is nothing less than booty, pillage and plunder, if you please, in 
the name of politics. The spoils system is the natural parent of one 
of the most despicable words in our language—Graft. There are 
literally thousands of men absolutely honest in all their personal 
dealings who, without compunction, would not hesitate to steal or 
to embezzle public funds, knowing that their conduct at worst will be 
given the euphonious name, “Graft.” Here, again, the masses of 
the people have suffered a shock in the almost universal suspicion cast 
upon office-holders, from the President of the United States down to 
the cross-roads magistrate. A genuinely honest citizenship can have 
honest politics, if it resolves to have it. But honest politics will not 
come through that type of party loyalty which shouts vociferously : 
“My party—right or wrong!” 
How much better are conditions in the social world? Men and 
women in dens of unspeakable iniquity daily openly flaunt their vices 
in the very faces of decency and morality, while men and women 
considered good citizens either shut their eyes, or excuse their inactiv- 
ity in the suppression of vice by saying that it is none of their busi- 
ness. In such cases officers of the law often find it difficult to secure 
the open moral support of so-called good citizens. How often do 
ministers of the gospel and other social leaders undertake social

  68 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
reform only to be deserted by the men and women who should stand 
for righteousness! The good citizen is on the side of right on any 
question; you do not have to ask on which side he stands; you know, 
because he stands for right. To be sure, the good citizen uses some 
common sense, some tact, some discretion. 
I beg that you do not set me down as a pessimist. I have an 
abiding faith in the good sense, the honesty and the patriotism of the 
American people. They need but to be aroused. An enlightened 
public conscience is the need of the hour. The citizen must under- 
stand that citizenship is a matter of personal obligation and personal 
performance. The problems before us cannot be solved in a day. 
Their just solution is to be the fruit of the wisest investigation and 
the profoundest patriotism. We have seen incompetents and dema- 
gogues essay to adjudicate some of these questions. What has been 
their success? Grotesque antics and childish legislation on the part 
of the incompetents and the most shameful political trickery and 
jobbery on the part of the demagogues. I am persuaded that the 
task legitimately belongs to the home, the school, the office, the shop— 
in every place where the activities of men are performed. In bring- 
ing about good citizenship the schools have a task to perform, but TI 
take little stock in that popular demand that the schools are to under- 
take everything. One set of agitators insists that our schools should 
make business men, another that they should train farmers, another 
that they should teach all manner of vocations, while the colleges 
declare that the schools are failing to train pupils to do any logical 
and persistent thinking. It behooves the schools not to become 
unduly excited. However, please do not imagine that you are not 
going to do much toward teaching patriotism by flying flags over 
your schoolhouses or by singing patriotic airs. They are both well 
enough in their places, but they will not produce a strong, virile 
citizenship. Citizenship has its roots in virtue and honesty and 
sincerity, not mere ceremonies. Good citizenship will not propagate 
and flourish in an atmosphere of bucket shops, or of race track gam- 
bling, or of immoral club life, or among feminine Monte Carlos con- 
ducted in the very citidels of virtue—the homes. Moreover, good 
citizenship comes most easily from citizens reasonably prosperous. 
Good citizenship is difficult to the man down and out. Luxury may 
not be the soil most conducive to good citizenship; neither is poverty. 
When poverty and virtue are pitted against each other, the devil 
begins to grin. The man riding in an automobile bought by mort- 
gaging his home usually runs his car in high gear straight toward 
disaster.

While we are training up a younger citizenship we must not forget 
the older. One of the safest and sanest ways to better the adult 
citizenship is to put into rigid practice the three “P.’s” in the purity 
of government—publicity, prosecution and penitentiary. Every 
really patriotic man will say with Terence: “I am a man, and nothing 
that concerns a man do I deem a matter of indifference to me.” 
Dr. Wuitrietp: We have just had a very interesting and a very 
entertaining paper, and one, I am sure, which has caused many in 
the audience to think of the many problems connected with good 
citizenship; certainly good citizenship is one of the great questions 
inthe country today. I would like to have a discussion along this 
line: Is the school, as at present conducted, making for good citi- 
zenship? 
Proressor R. P. Hatyeck, Principal Boys’ High School, Louis- 
ville, Ky.: I especially liked that part of the paper that calls for 
the codperation of the home. This would be of material assistance 
to any school. There ought to be a more scientific method of going 
about it. I wonder if the Southern Educational Association could 
be induced to form another association. There is the greatest power 
that has no association. I was wondering if the Home Association 
could not be formed. I know we have the Child Labor Association, 
etc., that bear on the home; but could we not have the Home Asso- 
ciation? (Applause.) 
A Memper (name not called): Mr. Chairman—lI liked that paper 
because he spoke of the difference between the citizen and citizen- 
ship. I remember a man by the name of Wilson in New York. 
He was a rich man and was a good man. He was born that way— 
and he was a good citizen. He had the highest ideal of citizen- 
ship—that doing something noble as a citizen was the highest form 
of citizenship. Now, the teachers tell their pupils that they are 
citizens in this great country, that they have the privilege of fran- 
chise, etc., but they say very little of actually doing some definite 
thing. Mr. Brown was walking along Broadway and he saw two 
turtles tied together with a string. He remonstrated with the 
owner, and the turtles were cut loose. Humane conduct is one of 
the essentials of good citizenship. I saw a man driving a horse— 
a poor old animal—and the horse fell. When the horse got up and 
started to walk, he limped, and the man struck the animal with a 
whip. I stopped him and asked him what was the matter with the 
horse. “He is unfit to be driven. He cannot walk straight.” 1
-P-A-G-E-70

do not believe the people in this beautiful city would countenance 
such cruelty if they knew of it. I am sure these people do not like 
such things. I said to the man: “Do you not know of the Society 
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals?” He said: “I do not 
know anything about it.” Now that man is a citizen here, but what 
of his citizenship? I teach my scholars that if they see anything 
of this kind, it is their duty as citizens to do something about it. 
To have a splendid citizenship we must be as good citizens as we can 
be. Teachers can instill this idea into the minds of their pupils. 
The Home Association spoken of by the gentleman who preceded 
me is a very large subject; but I believe we all agree it is a great 
thing. I think this codperation between the home and the school 
would be most beneficial. (Applause.) 
Dr. Wotrn: I should like to say a word on that Home Associa- 
tion question. While I was Superintendent at San Antonio, Texas, 
there were mothers’ clubs and parents’ meetings in every school in 
the State. That did great good, yet we did not do as much as we 
might do, because it is almost impossible to get a great body of 
people anywhere to work together in perfect harmony. Those who 
attended our meetings were of the best classes. 
There is one thing I have done recently that I have never done 
before. I am asking the parents of our children by circular letter 
to codperate with us in the things we are attempting to do. I think 
we ought to take the home into our confidence. For instance, we 
are attempting to do better reading in Memphis. All educators are 
considering the question of better reading. In this circular letter 
we went into the matter thoroughly. We said the children have 
but little opportunity for reading aloud; as a rule they read aloud 
only a paragraph or two a day. If you will allow the children to 
read aloud to you an interesting story every day, it will help them 
and us a great deal. We found a ready and hearty response from 
the homes of our children. Aside from the benefit to the children, 
we are interesting the homes in school work, and the families at 
home are reading more than they did. 
Then we are also starting a great garden movement. We hope 
to have three thousand pupils taught gardening in school. In an- 
other circular I am asking the home to codperate with us in encour- 
aging the boys to get garden plots ready for spring work. These 
are simply concrete examples. 
Another thing I think ought to be done is that the pec at home 
should be told that the school does not want them to help the chil- 
dren get their lessons at home. (Applause.) |

A Memeer (name not called): I was very much interested in 
that discussion and in the paper, especially the sentence, “To make 
a good citizen, you must make him prosperous.” I want to illus- 
trate that from the rural schools. I believe that the only way to 
make a better citizenship is to get the people in the home to think- 
ing that we can put those things in the school that are the most 
important in their every-day lives. We must not let the school be 
limited by its four walls. Move back the walls of the schoolhouse 
until they rest upon the outskirts of the district in which the school 
resides. 
About two years ago a boy went into the Boys’ Corn Club. A 
great many of us are interested in that as a phase of school work. 
He succeeded in growing ninety-seven bushels of corn. He followed 
the instructions given him in school, and grew more corn than his 
father did. I was talking to his father about this work, and he 
told me he was a thousand dollars richer because of the increase in 
the production of corn on his farm; so you can readily see what 
this training will mean to the agricultural interests of the South. 
That farmer said to me: “Next year you will find me building my 
new home on account of the increased prosperity that has come to 
us in connection with this work ;” and it strikes me that this is one 
of the best ways to make better citizenship in rural communities, 
and as far as I have been able to find out, there seems no better 
way—for to make a man a good citizen, you must make him pros- 
perous. (Applause.) 
Dr. Wurrriecp: I regret that we must close this discussion, 
interesting though it has been, as the time allowed for it is up. 
The next speaker on our program is Dr. A. Caswell Ellis, Director 
of the Department of Extension, Austin, Texas, who is to speak 
on “What Educates for ‘Grafting ;? What for ‘Citizenship?’” Dr. 
Ellis is absent and the discussion would necessarily be along the 
lines of the previous discussion, so we will pass on to the next 
speaker, who is Mrs. Mary C. Roark, Dean of Women in the State 
Normal School at Richmond, Ky. 
Ladies and gentlemen, it affords me unusual pleasure to have the 
honor of presenting to you Mrs. Roark, who will address us on “A 
Plea for a Neglected Art.” (Applause.)

It was perhaps inevitable that in our frantic endeavor to meet the 
ever-increasing demands made upon the schools by our awakened

social consciousness of the changing social needs, some very vital 
things should have been overlooked. From time to time we have 
shifted the emphasis in our instruction from the purely disciplinary 
and cultural through all the various phases of humanistic, realistic, 
naturalistic, psychological, sociological, and every conceivable com- 
bination of these, until today we have arrived at the eminently 
practical and utilitarian. 
The young people of this generation, representing, as they do, the 
combined result of all the formal and informal educational influences 
that have moulded them, are the concrete, unanswerable proof of the 
efficacy or inefficacy of our educational methods. 
Judged by their intellectual attainments, on the whole they do us 
credit. They know so much more than we did at their age, and 
about things we had never heard of. They live out on the great 
public highway that leads everywhere and fearlessly ask their why’s 
and what-for’s in that eager spirit of investigation that characterizes 
the age. We like their optimism, their social democracy, their open- 
mindedness, and a thousand fine things about them. It is because 
we love them and covet for them the best gifts in every department of 
life that we see with increasing alarm certain retrogressive changes in 
their social ideals. Judged by standards of the past generation, a 
majority of our young people today are sadly deficient in the fine art 
of behavior. Is it possible that we teachers are largely to blame 
that they are often lacking in reverence and deference and those 
refinements of manner that are the index of fine souls; that they are 
loud and familiar and seem to be obsessed with a desire to have a 
“good time,” cost what it may! 
Thoughtful people are distressed at the increasing familiarity and 
freedom of manner between the sexes. Our civilization is losing 
something very fine when our boys cease to express in their manners 
deferential respect for womanhood,, and our girls no longer emulate 
those qualities that have made the gentle woman worthy of this 
deference. 
Like Alice in Wonderland, our young people seem to have found 
somewhere in their mathematics “Uglification and Derision,” and to 
have translated these into their manners. In the last quarter of a 
century we have lost that priceless heritage that should have been ours 
forever—the Puritan standard of morals and the Cavalier standard 
of manners. If these two could have been fused together, softened 
and democratized, they would have given an ideal of conduct worthy 
a peerless people. 
Various influences have brought about this decadence in manners. 
Idleness and freedom from restraint have had no small share in caus-  
-P-A-G-E-73
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 73 
ing the deterioration. We all deplore child labor and are rapidly 
outlawing it; yet I doubt if with all its horrors it has ever had the 
blighting influence over its victims that idleness and extravagance of 
time and money have over the children of the prosperous. 
The way in which we spend our leisure is the surest test of our 
civilization. The modern amusements and recreations are too often 
of a character to debase our taste and lower our standard of conduct. 
It will be most unfortunate if, after all the shouting, and turmoil, 
over the victorious athlete have ceased, it will be found in the final 
reckonings that the great masses of cur young people whose sole 
physical training has been gained for them in some strange, vicarious 
way by their athletic teams, shall have acquired only belligerency of 
spirit and coarseness of manners. 
Not only do our games and amusements have a tendency to bring 
about familiarity and freedom of manner, but in much of our modern 
literature the ideals of conduct are shockingly low. If the fiction of 
today is correctly reflecting present social ideals, then the situation is 
indeed perilous. One and two generations ago the ideals of manhood 
and womanhood given us in our great fiction were pure and lofty, 
such characters as John Halifax, Col. Newcomb, Pompilia and Agnes, 
noble men and women, who were worthy ideals for the impressionable 
young reader. 
At picture shows and in much of the modern drama and fiction our 
young people are giving intellectual hospitality to coarse, crude, even 
immoral people who would not be tolerated in decent society; people 
whose manners are repulsive; whose language is corrupt, whose moral 
senses are blunted. No one can be subjected constantly to these 
debasing influences without contamination. 
But the largest contributing cause for the lack of gentle and 
artistic manners today is our failure to give definite instruction on the 
subject in our schools. | Not only are teachers not required to teach 
behavior as a fine art, but total ignorance of the subject on their own 
part is frequently no disqualification for a position in either our 
public schools or our highest institutions of learning. There should 
be no separation between scholarship and gentle manners, for the 
two are essentially parts of a beautiful whole; but in this day of 
early specialization and the frantic effort after getting, and as a 
result of our putting constant emphasis on doing rather than being, 
they are frequently divorced. The large influx of students into our 
schools has been too great for the little leaven of culture and refine- 
ment to affect the mass. 
At no time in the past has so little attention been given to this 
vital subject. Confucius, Buddha and the Hebrew rabbis taught 
  | | \ 
Seneca 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  
  74 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
high ideals of conduct. Plato, Aristotle, Senaca and Cicero worked 
no more for the development of thought and the extension of knowl- 
edge than for perfection in manners and morals. The people of the 
Orient excel us in charm and grace of courtesy, and the world still 
turns to the Greeks for ideals of beauty expressed no less in the 
manners of their cultivated citizens than in their art and literature. 
We need not go so far back in the past for examples of the value 
of special teaching in conduct. France has the most courteous 
citizens in the world. Their behavior as a fine art is taught system- 
atically in all the schools. It forms an integral part of the curricu- 
lum, and the French children are so trained in artistic, impersonal 
manners that perfect courtesy becomes a habit. 
It is passing strange that we have neglected manners in our schools, 
when we have been so ready to introduce everything else into our 
eurriculum. All down the years the great educational leaders, 
whom we so gladly follow in most of their teachings, have emphasized 
the need of specific training in behavior. Comenius, Rabelais, Rous- 
seau, Pstalozzi, Froebel, and Herbart, all these great souls have 
believed that while conduct is a revelation of character, the expression 
of the inner spirit, yet it is also true that good manners will react on 
the inner spirit and beautify it. In brief, that good manners induce 
good morals. Without doubt the basis of good manners and good 
morals is the same. Training for the sake of courteous behavior in 
the practical application of the golden rule; in kindliness, unselfish- 
ness, self-control, generosity, deference and delicate consideration 
for others—without which good manners are impossible—is no less a 
training in morals. The two are inseparably connected. Is it not 
[ evident that the most important part of the work of the school today 
| \ is to so train the young that they will take the basic laws of social 
conduct that have been worked out by the race and translate them 
| into unconscious habits of action? These laws are the most priceless 
| part of our social heritage. _Weshould bind them upon the foreheads 
of the young of this generation, and place them as a seal upon their 
hands. We must leave to each individual school the question of 
how to teach manners. It will be found true always that the most 
effective means of teaching high ideals of conduct will be through 
| the fine, strong, sympathetic personality of the teacher. As Emerson~ 
| has said: “Good manners are communicable,” though it seems that 
' many are immune to the contagion. 
Teachers should draw upon the exhaustless wealth in literature 
for ideals of beautiful behavior. They should use the drama, the 
poem, the novel, the best type of manhood and womanhood, to furnish
-P-A-G-E-75
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 15 
examples of artistic living. The instruction in behavior should be 
systematic, vigorous and direct. Only those who know right conduct 
can possess it. How can they know except they be taught? Only 
those who have a beautiful ideal toward which they are working can, 
grow. We need a modern Prometheus to carry to the young people | 
of this materialistic age the sacred fire of ideality. The schools | 
should not be content with the intermittent putting-on of good man- 
ners as a Sunday garment—but right conduct must be made a per- 
taanent habit. 
As Dr. James has so forcibly said: “The great thing in all educa- 
tion is to fund and capitalize our acquisitions and live at ease upon 
the interest of the fund. For this we must make automatic and 
habitual, as early as possible, as many useful actions as we can, and 
guard against the growing into ways likely to be disadvantageous to 
us, as we should guard against the plague. The more of the details 
of our daily life we can hand over to the effortless custody of autom- 
atism, the more the higher powers of mind will be set free for their 
own proper work.” Thirty years ago James Russell Lowell wrote: 
“What we need more than anything else is to increase the number of 
our highly cultivated men and thoroughly trained minds; for these, 
wherever they go, are sure to carry with them, consciously or not, 
the seeds of sounder thinking and of higher ideals of conduct. 
Democracy must show its capacity for producing not a higher average 
man, but the highest possible types of manhood and womanhood in all 
their manifold varieties, or it is a failure. No matter what it does 
for the body, if it do not in some sort satisfy that inextinguishable 
passion of the soul for something that lifts life away from the common 
and the vulgar, it is a failure. Unless it know how to make itself 
gracious and winning, it is a failure.” 
We should no longer neglect the fine art of behavior in our courses 
of study. It is the business of the nation’s schools to help realize the 
nation’s ideal of an ethical democracy, whose citizens are trained for 
the highest possible degree of social efficiency and for completeness of 
living. 
The inspiration for the ideal of beautiful behavior today should 
have a nobler source than the ideals of the pagans, or the Knights of 
Chivalry or the Slave-Served generations that preceded ours. It 
must be based upon our democratic ideal of the essential equality of 
all men and an abiding belief in the indwelling of the divine in every 
human soul. This idea wrought out in our behavior will give to our 
manners cordiality without familiarity, graciousness without affecta- 
tion, dignity without arrogance, and deference without servility.

Presipent Wuitriptp: We will give ten minutes to discussion of 
this question. 
A GENTLEMAN FROM RusseLLviILLn, Ky.: The deplorable freedom 
and familiarity that is springing up between our boys and girls, espe- 
cially young boys and girls, is a matter which should receive our grave 
consideration. Recent evidence of this was given into my hand of 
girls taking the initiative of writing notes, letters to young men, of 
whom they have no knowledge, except what they learn from their 
schoolgirl friends, and in several such cases replies have come into my 
hands. I have one here:   
“NOVEMBER 26TH. 
“To THE LirrLe Girt I Don’: Know :”—(“I don’t know,” mark that. The 
girl had been rude enough not to sign her name to the note she sent.) 
“How are you? Iam fine and dandy. Be sure to come to (So-and-So’s) 
Christmas, as I want to see you. I will try to make you have a good time— 
that is, I will do my best—so come and tell me some funny stories.” (This 
girl who wrote to this young man said what she heard from her girl friend.) 
“T am still living at (So-and-So’s) home, so, you see, I will be with you all the 
time. Lovingly” (and the name signed). 
This is only a single, concrete example of this familiarity. 
SUPERINTENDENT Mixuer, Knoxville, Tenn.: I have listened to the 
paper with interest. I have come to the conclusion that the lack of 
dignity and self-control in the parents has had its blighting influence 
on the children of our day in this question of fine manners. I was 
City Superintendent for two years, and I am sure that every man who 
has taught school during our day is not surprised at the irreverent 
attitude of the boys and girls when they see their parents and observe 
their homes. I am not surprised at all at the boys and girls, when I 
see the parents in my office. I am not surprised at the attitude of the 
pupils when I see the teacher. I believe reverence will be given where 
reverence is due. If this is not in the heart of the teacher, the school 
will not be stronger than the teacher. It seems to me that if I saw 
one quality that was absent and conspicuous by its absence, it was 
that the teacher does not teach them reverence because their attention 
is centered on other things. In a high school of seven hundred boys 
and girls, there is no spirit of reverence. I believe a large number 
of them only want a good time. I.am familiar with their parents 
and am not surprised at the children’s marked spirit of irreverence.

I visited a home twenty miles from a railroad where there were 
sixteen children. They had a good father and a good mother. The 
children were reverential and possessed of the cardinal virtues. I 
think this was due to the influence of their parents exclusively. The 
atmosphere which they created in their home developed these children 
in this beautiful manner. You men know that the root of all these 
delightful manners lies in the influence of the mother and the teacher, 
the home and the schoolroom, and does not lie in text-books. We 
must have better mothers and teachers whose personality will com- 
mand respect. Until we get that, we may expect this trouble. When 
I enter a school, I can tell by the class the personality of the teacher. 
In the South, we have tried to bring about a culmination of every 
virtue through prohibition and the curfew law. These things ought 
to be taught in school to some extent, but it is perfectly useless where 
you have impersonal teachers to do this. 
Present Wuirrietp: We will have to suspend the discussion of 
this important matter, as our time limit has passed. I will next 
introduce to this audience the Hon. W. E. Halbrook, of Choctaw, 
Arkansas, who will address us on “Training for Coéperative and 
Systematic Activities in the Rural Schools.” (Applause.) 
Mr. Horproox: I know little about the city, since I have lived in 
the country all my life, and I can only talk from my own experiences. 
There are five country schools in the section where I live. I spend a 
week at one, then go about six miles away to another. I am going to 
tell you something regarding the situation in the country schools in 
my State. 
TRAINING FoR Co-OPHRATIVE AND SYSTEMATIC ACTIVITIES IN THE

W. EB. HALBROOK, SUPERINTENDENT HALBROOK SYSTEM OF SCHOOLS, 
CHOCTAW, ARKANSAS, 
My attention was once attracted to a lone cornstalk which grew 
by chance in my father’s garden. From day to day its stately 
appearance told of the rich soil from which it drew sustenance. 
The small cornstalks in the corn field were puny in comparison, 
and we were compelled to admire this lone cornstalk as it towered 
above the other garden products. But when the harvest came, we 
gathered an ear heavily husked, and on the silky cob a grain here 
and there, while the little stalks out in the field made the bread 
that fed the world.  
-P-A-G-E-78
  18 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
I fear that our rural schools have been conducted too much along 
the “lone cornstalk” line. In conversation with a certain man the 
other day in one of my rural communities, he stated that his school 
district had sent forth some stars, men and women who are making 
their mark; but that the school and the community were nothing 
like as lively and intellectual even as they were a decade or genera- 
tion ago. Is this generally true? We have in our rural vicinities 
boys and girls that are bright, boys and girls that are going to 
figure in the future events of our country, and upon them we are 
directing our efforts and to them we shall point with a pride that 
our efforts as teachers have not been futile and our schools not mere 
vanity. 
Often do we hear the cry, “Educate the bright boys and girls 
back to the farm.” But with all our noblest efforts in this direction 
many and perhaps most all our brightest boys are still going to hie 
cityward. To solve this difficult question, country conditions must 
be ascertained and our method of school work adjusted thereto. 
Let us for a moment note some of the most prominent characters 
that the rural teacher has to deal with. 5 
First is Mr. “Bell Wether,’ a man with democratic pretensions, 
with aristocratic propensities, and with theocratic tendencies. 
His opinions are above par, and his will has been allowed to domi- 
nate the affairs of the community for a generation. He frequently 
is surrounded with a coterie of sons, renters and sons-in-law, who 
passively rotate about this axis of human dictation. His off- 
spring are in the rural school, with this environment and these 
tendencies as their only heritage, to be molded into social factors. 
Second, is his brother-in-law, Mr. “Rule-or-Ruin.” We distin- 
guish this gentleman from the former in that he has a kind of 
bloodthirsty characteristic, takes rather a delight in “bustin’ things 
up,” and especially if he were not consulted in its building. He is 
a braggadocio, and takes pleasure in thumping mules, kicking inno- 
cent hounds and cuffing children. His civilized attributes are more 
from a fear of punishment than a hope of reward. His offspring 
are in this school to be molded into social factors. 
Third, is Mr. “EHasy-Goer.” This gentleman is complimented by 
his neighbors as a man that attends strictly to his own business, 
as high a compliment as one can merit in a rural community. 
(What if all the community were of this type?) It is perfectly 
agreeable with him for anybody to teach his school, for anybody 
to pastor his church, for taxes to be voted up or down, for his chil-- 
dren to be loafing over hill or in the hollow. It is all right with
-P-A-G-E-79
  JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 19 
him if John Dee is elected school director, or Richard Roe. He 
never contributes unless his neighbor insists, never founds an insti- 
tution for good or bad, nor fosters one founded by any other. He 
does take due precaution not to impede its progress, “for,” says he, 
“it might be a good thing if they would properly carry it out.” 
His offspring are in this school to be molded into social factors. 
Fourth, is Mr. “Dimmy Crat,” the man who glories in the prin- 
ciples of his political party and has an eye of suspicion askance at 
all persons of a different political complexion. They are rascals, 
and he has had so many tilts with them about election time and 
his political feeling ran so high till he had rather see the commu- 
nity go to demolition than for one of the other “set” to be recog- 
nized as a factor. His offspring are in this school to be molded into 
social factors. 
Fifth, is Mr. “Modern Pharisee,” a cousin of Mr. “Dimmy Crat.” 
This character is wrapped up in the creeds of his church, regarding 
as seed of his Satanic Majesty all those who hold to any other, or 
are blind fools because they cannot interpret Holy Writ as they 
might through his eyes. Heated discussions wax and feelings are 
engendered that preclude the possibility of harmony on any other 
proposition, however vital. His offspring are in this school to be 
molded into social factors. 
Sixth, is Mr. “Sour-Grouch.” He is a wonderful peculiarity. 
He has an acid reaction on alkalies, and an alkaline reaction on 
acids. Something in the church doesn’t snit, he quarrels with the 
school board, he finds fault with the teacher and preacher, his chil- 
dren never hear a word of kindness, and his wife would find rest in 
the lower regions. Querulous and choleric, he sends his offspring 
to this school to be molded into social factors. 
Seventh, is Mr. “Tight-Fist.” He does not particularly oppose 
anything that will enhance the value of his property in his com- 
munity; but by all means call not on him to contribute one penny. 
The prehensile tendons of his fingers have attracted all the vitality 
from the extensile tendons. To him book companies are robbers, 
children are prodigal, taxes are astounding, school teachers receiv- 
ing forty dollars a month are extortionate, preachers never touch 
the gospel but cry for money, and the whole world is on the beat. 
His offspring are in this school to be molded into social factors. 
These, with the daughters of “Sister Tell-Tale,’ constitute our 
ordinary assortment of raw material, for which only a small pro- 
tective tariff is levied. Sunday school was organized one fine 
spring morning; had a large Bible class for a few Sundays; but 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
    80 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
one day Brothers “Modern Pharisee” and “Rule-or-Ruin” got into 
an argument as to whom the wolf caught, in John 10: 10; the chil- 
dren soon were in the swimming hole or on the flyin’ jenny, and 
Sunday school died. One Saturday night there was a_ political 
speaker to discuss the tariff at the schoolhouse, and the preacher 
at church was to preach on “The Final Perseverance of the Saints.” 
But the young people had already arranged for a frolic, and dis- 
regarding the tariff on leather and the warnings of the good 
preacher, they backslid into revelry and wore out good soles. Then 
some singing teacher came in and taught a class, introducing new 
songs and books, and Brother “Sour-Grouch” said that it had 
killed all the religion of the community, because he could no longer 
hear the chimes of “Amazing Grace.” 
Later a “Farmers’ Union” was organized, and the popular Mr. 
“Hasy-Goer” was elected president. Long-drawn and irrelevant 
discussions often narcotized the assembly, and at one meeting two 
men were trying to talk at the same time. The president insisted 
on a compromise, but each grew more vociferous for his rights. 
He adjourned the local, and, not desiring to be a party to hard 
feelings, he never returned. Another president was elected, and 
matters moved smoothly for a time, till one meeting Brother “Sour- 
Grouch,” in a spell of pessimism, threw a coolness on a certain 
undertaking. Not one member knew how to counteract it. Attend- 
ance fell off. At last there arose a squabble over some unfinished 
business that had been on hand for a year, of which, when pressed, 
they could find indefinite record. Then some one suggested that 
a straightening of the secretary’s and the treasurer’s books would 
be a fine thing. Head nor tail of either could be found. The local 
adjourned sine die. 
Are our schools meeting this situation? Some of our boys and 
girls are devouring books, are climbing to a higher sphere of life, 
and are the “stars” to whom I previously referred, while the 
restless boy, the dull and the incorrigible, remain in the country 
to rear families and promote country life. At school they were 
scorned, reprimanded and flogged, hence what support and interest 
may we expect for our schools? 
We believe that in our schools in north central Arkansas, over 
which I have supervision, we are partially solving this problem. 
These are the forces that we use: athletics, school improvement 
clubs, singings, quartettes, cornet bands, corn clubs, and what we 
term literary societies. I cannot detail our work in all these, but 
a few suggestions will be sufficient.
-P-A-G-E-81
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 8L 
In each of our schools there are three teachers, and each teacher 
chooses some specific work which she agrees to do outside of her 
regular schoolroom activity. One takes athletics, another school 
improvement work, and the third literary societies. 
Miss A. organizes her children into squads, seeing that every 
pupil has something to do. They plan to clear away a piece of 
ground in a certain corner and plant flowers therein. One squad 
of boys is selected with a leader to clear away the rubbish; a squad 
of girls beg eggs from the mothers and buy flower seeds; another 
squad of boys locate and borrow tools; some boy takes note of every 
tool and sees that it is duly returned to its proper owner. The 
whole work must have system in every part. The boy who shirks 
feels the public indignation and is thereby lashed into line. Child- 
hood is the time when public spirit is most easily developed, and 
habits of systematic activity should especially be begun. 
Games offer excellent opportunity for training the codperative 
spirit. The sons of Mr. “Bell Wether” are made to feel equal, or 
sometimes of less importance than their inferiors in social standing, 
and the sons of “Rule-or-Ruin” learn to keep their passions within 
due bounds. The sons of “Sour-Grouch” cultivate their cheerful 
side, while those of “Tight-Fist” must contribute their mite if they 
participate in the events. But the most important feature is the 
team work. These various sons plan together, train together, make 
sacrifice hits, obey their captains, and keep up spirits in times of 
defeat. It furthermore cultivates a spirit of loyalty and local pride, 
and all their interests are merged into a single purpose. Hach of 
our schools has an athletic association, arrange games, send stu- 
dent representatives, and confer with members or with the body of 
other associations. A lifetime fellowship is welded, and those 
young men are strong factors for good. Let me suggest, however, 
that athletics should have wise direction, and behind the machine 
should be a strong personality that injects an undercurrent of square 
deal and fair play. 
But the factor most effective in molding these heterogeneous 
particles into a homogeneous mass, called society, is our literary 
club. It is here that young men and young women learn to man- 
age assemblies and to expedite public business. They learn to 
express themselves without reflecting upon those holding a different 
opinion. They are trained in the elements of parliamentary 
usages, and they learn to select men for officers and committees 
because of their peculiar fitness for the position. The leadership 
of “Bell Wether’s” sons is cultivated along a higher plane, while 
6

the sons of “Rule-or-Ruin” give opportunity for developing the 
ability of the membership in controlling disorderly characters; 
the daughters of “Sister Tell-Tale” make excelient recording and 
corresponding secretaries, to note everything that goes on; the 
embryo politician learns human nature and how to manipulate the 
several forces to carry his point; the sons of “Hasy-Goer” make 
good governor balls to the engine; the sons of “Tight-Fist” make 
good collectors of fines and dues, and keep the business department 
of the organization in trim shape; the sons of “Sour-Grouch” are 
good critics and censors, and continually seeing imperfections, they 
strive to make the institution better by pointing out and offering 
remedies; the sons of “Modern Pharisee” are sticklers for the con- 
stitution and by-laws, and keep the society reminded of its viola- 
tions of Roberts’ Rules of Order. They have programs, yes. But 
these are to intersperse or entertain—just a task assigned. But 
the business feature has the most important educative value, and 
whether a student can learn books or not, he can here at least real- 
ize that he is a factor and that there is something of consequence 
that he can do. 
It has been my pleasure to see the results of this kind of train- 
ing on the citizenship of a community. Some of our dull and rest- 
less boys—boys and girls who could not make progress in their 
grades—have married and “settled down” in the community for 
life. There is among them a desire for associations wherein they 
can feed; associations of a higher type than we ordinarily have in 
the rural community. They are active in Sunday school, clubs and 
everything that tends to promote the interest of the community. 
Others who have located in other communities are felt from the 
first. They understand how to organize and mobilize the forces 
in the community for good. Ask anyone of them today where he 
got that ability, and while he may attribute some of it to his cor- 
relative reading, he will tell you for the most part it was the cor- 
relative functions in his school life. 
Mr. Harsrook: I want to call your attention to something just 
before concluding my last paragraph. I want you to know some- 
thing that is not in the paper. 
In rural communities, as most of you perhaps know, you come 
in there as a stranger, and they will stand off and look at you and 
laugh, and perhaps no one will ever accost you or make you feel at 
home. In our community, we are training our boys and girls, 
when a stranger comes into our locality, it is their duty to make 
them feel at home, and it is our aim to make every one who comes
-P-A-G-E-83
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 83 
among us feel welcome. We have organizations and committees to 
look after this feature of the work. Everything is done by system. 
Now I want to call your attention to another fact: this copépera- 
tion between the boys and girls is contagious. It catches with the 
parents. It has brought them in touch and in line with our work, 
even those fathers and mothers who were formerly indifferent and 
even antagonistic to the schools. In one family a young man about 
fifteen years old died. His parents had been opposed to the school ; 
but in accordance with our custom, we made arrangements for the 
interment of this boy. We had our songs and service. We selected 
pallbearers from among his intimate friends. They were taken to 
the school and trained in their work of how to care for this corpse. 
They did this effectively, and to this day that father and mother are 
closely attached to the school. 
There is one feature I wish to speak of right here. The teacher 
must have entire control, but so far as is possible, in the activities 
of which I speak, we allow the pupils to manage their own business. 
The teacher who fails to utilize these tendencies of youth and 
similar methods of procedure has neglected a vital opportunity. 
This will give vigor to school life; it will relieve the spirit of 
drudgery that so often exists in the country homes, more especially 
among the mothers; it will reduce the number of divorce suits; it 
will harmonize religious schisms; it will supplant the drink habit 
as a token of fellowship; it will mitigate the prejudice or envy of 
countryman toward “town folks,” the carrion whereon vulturine 
demagogues feast and soar high in popular skies; it will vitalize 
rural life, perpetuate democracy and preserve society. 
Presipent Wuitrrietp: I do not know how you think about this, 
but I would be willing to award the prize to the professor from the 
Ozarks. According to our program, we shall now have the pleasure 
of hearing from Dr. H. R. McIlwaine, State Librarian, Richmond, 
Va., whose topic is the “Unification of the State’s Library Interests 
Under the Leadership of the State Library.” Ladies and gentle- 
men, I have the honor to present to you Dr. McIlwane. 
UNIFICATION OF THE Statn’s Liprary INturREsts UNDER THE 
LeapERSHIP oF THE Stare LIBRARY. 
H. R. M’ILWAINE, RICHMOND, VA. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen—Modern researches with 
pick and spade show that libraries existed in the ancient world 
many centuries before the birth of Christ. Babylonia, Assyria and
-P-A-G-E-84
  84 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Egypt possessed these products of an advanced civilization at a 
very remote period in the past. And as civilization has slowly 
spread throughout the earth, these institutions have multiplied. 
It may be safely said, however, that it is only within the last thirty 
or forty years that the possibilities of libraries as agencies for the 
advancement of education of the people in the broadest sense have 
been realized. What has begun to be spoken of as the library move- 
ment is a thing of very recent birth indeed. 
The library movement means the movement to encourage the use 
in the fullest manner of existing libraries, to strengthen them, and 
to bring about the establishment of such a number of others as will 
be necessary to place ample library facilities within the reach of all. 
And it means a little more than this. It means the instruction of 
the people as to the benefits to be derived from libraries and their 
encouragement in the use of them when established. This move- 
ment, though, as has been said, of comparatively recent origin, has 
already accomplished much. Anyone will admit this who com- 
pares the management and condition of almost any library today 
with its management and condition fifteen or twenty years ago. 
And the further back one’s memory reaches, the more striking does 
he find the contrast. Take almost any college library, for example. 
Fifteen or twenty years ago the library was little used by the stu- 
dents. As likely as not, it was open only a few hours a day. Not 
only did the professors fail to encourage, as a general thing, their 
students to use the library, but they were inclined rather to dis- 
courage the use of it, under the control of the idea that the time 
spent in the library was just so much time diverted from the study 
of the all-important text-books. Those were the days when the 
accurate recitation of the text-book was in vogue, and the student 
stood in greater danger of conceiving such a dislike for books that 
on graduation he would forswear association with them for the 
future. Now the library is open all day long and probably some 
hours at night. Parallel reading is required, and topics are 
assigned the students, the discussion of which necessitates their 
using the library freely. The effort is made to convert the college 
man or woman into a studious reader rather than into a mere recep- 
tacle of facts obtained from a few text-books. Such a student 
goes out into life having been taught the use of a library and 
thus equipped to continue his studies in the future. Having been 
compelled to read widely, he has very likely a fondness for reading, 
and hence the college has sent him forth with the greatest boon that 
could be bestowed on him. He will read in after life not only for
-P-A-G-E-85
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 85 
the sake of efficiency in his chosen calling, but also for cultivation 
and inspiration. 
And the same effort is seen to extend the use made of libraries 
of other kinds. The modern library has become a business institu- 
tion whose object is to serve with books and information as large 
a number of people as possible in the shortest time consistent with 
the adequate service. It adopts business methods, too, in advertis- 
ing its goods. It sends out bulletins, circulars, and lists giving 
information as to what it has, and it sends out on occasions invita- 
tions to members of associations and to individuals to visit the library 
in order to examine some special collection. Perhaps I might better 
say that it has the missionary spirit, rather than the business spirit; 
or, better still, the missionary spirit combined with a business method. 
It delights the true library worker to lead away from 
“ the heavy and the weary weight 
Of all this untelligible world” 
to the place called by the ancient Egyptian king “the dispensary of the 
soul,” or to lead the active worker in some useful occupation to a store- 
house of information the use of which will make him all the more 
skillful and productive. For the appeal of the modern library is 
to all. 
In this movement to bring an ample supply of books within the 
reach of all are enlisted not only individuals as such but also individ- 
uals combined into associations; and, in addition, the governments 
in the various countries of the civilized world have taken and are 
taking an active part, and nowhere a more active part than in Amer- 
ica. With us the sum total of the functions of government are 
parcelled out among our local governments, our State governments, 
and the national government, and the erection by the various units of 
local government of free public libraries supported by taxation is 
probably the most noticeable feature of the whole library movement. 
However, a great deal is left for the State governments to do, and 
even for the national government. , The general assemblies of most 
of the States have awaked to a realization of their duties along this 
line, and every year we hear of the strengthening of old agencies and 
the creation of new for the accomplishment of the desired results. 
The subject on which I was asked to prepare a paper is “The Unifica- 
tion of the State’s Library Interests Under the Leadership of the 
State Library.” The paper which I have written in obedience to this 
request consists mainly of an enumeration of the agencies of the 
State for doing library work, with brief reasons given for thinking 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  86 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
that it would probably be best for those agencies to be concentrated 
in the State library. A better title for the paper would probably 
be “The Proper Functions of a State Library.” 
The State library is itself an agency created long since in most of 
the States for performing functions recognized as useful in the admin- 
istration of affairs. It was early seen that the various branches of 
the government—the legislative, the executive, and the judicial— 
could attend better to the important business appropriate to each if 
they had the advantage of consulting a large collection of books 
recording the experience of other States dealing with similar prob- 
lems. Especially was a collection of the laws of other States and the 
court reports desired for the use of the highest law court in each. 
Hence, collections in law were the first collections made, exchanges 
among the various States taking place of the law books—that is, the 
acts of assembly and the court reports—published by one for those 
published by the others. Gradually there were added to these in most 
instances miscellaneous collections which would also be of use to the 
judges and State officials in the conduct of their work, and legislative 
journals, reports, and documents, and the reports of the executive 
departments. The miscellaneous material—almost always historical 
and literary—grew in course of time to be of great importance, and 
of great interest to the public at large, who were usually allowed the 
use of it. Of course, the growth of these collections has varied 
greatly in the different States both in extent and nature, some of the 
State libraries having in them even yet merely law books, while others 
have collections representing all branches of knowledge. In fact, 
the miscellaneous collections and the law collections have been put 
under distinct management in several of the States, in some cases 
. what is called the State Library of a State being a law library pure 
and simple, for the use primarily of the highest court of the State, but 
open for consultation to all, and in other cases what is known as the 
State Library is the general collection. This is the case in Virginia. 
The State Library contains the miscellaneous collection, including all 
the legislative and executive documents received in exchange from 
other States and those deposited by the United States Government, 
and the State Law Library, or as it is sometimes called, the library of 
the Supreme Court of Appeals, containing the law books received in 
exchange and those purchased. The exchange of material is con- 
ducted by the State Library, which sends to the law library the acts 
of assembly, the codes, and the court reports received, reserving for its 
own shelves the other books included in any shipment coming in from 
one of the other States. This work of exchanging the publications 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 87 
gotten out by the State of Virginia for the publications of other 
States is a very important one, for, contrary to popular belief, much 
of the material published by the various States is of the greatest value, 
and it is becoming more and more customary for the officials of one 
State to use the documents coming from another. In some of the 
States the management of the miscellaneous collections is entrusted 
to what is called the department of archives and history. The name 
of the department shows that it is intended to care for the archives of 
the State which are turned over to it by the various departments of 
the State government after they cease to be of use in the current work 
of the department, and to collect manuscripts and books illustrating 
the history of the State. Alabama, Mississippi, and West Virginia 
have, I think, departments of archives and history with these duties— 
duties usually performed by the State libraries, and these libraries 
are not exclusively law libraries. In Virginia the State library has 
as one of its branches the department of archives and history. When 
the department of archives and history has, in addition to the work 
that its name would indicate, the care of the State’s miscellaneous 
collection, it is in fact the general library of the State and would, if 
the terminology used in Virginia were followed, be called the State 
Library. I am far from suggesting that such a change in the title 
should be made, however, since the title used in Virginia is not a good 
one. Some word should be in it to indicate the real character of 
the library, since the majority of those who do not know its character 
suppose it to be, I am confident, either the law library of the State, or 
at least the law library and the miscellaneous library in one. It 
means the one thing or the other to a person according to the usage 
with which he is familiar. It would be far better if there were in 
the title the word “miscellaneous.” Thus, the “Virginia State Mis- 
cellaneous Library” would be much more likely to convey an adequate 
idea as to its character than does the present title, though even that 
would not suggest the work done with the archives and the manu- 
scripts. 
It is rather unfortunate that the term, “State Library,” does not 
have the same meaning all over the country, but so far as this paper is. 
concerned, the trouble may be rectified by giving a definition of the 
term in the sense in which I wish to use it from this point on. I wish 
it to mean the miscellaneous collection of the State, either with the 
law collection, as in California, or without, as in Virginia. I do not 
wish it to mean the law library by itself. 
To the State libraries should be assigned the performance of the 
various so-called library extension duties which in recent years have
-P-A-G-E-88
  88 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
been undertaken. In the first place, a State Library should, of 
course, conduct the legislative reference work of which such a feature 
has been made in some States, notably, Wisconsin and New York. 
The State should appropriate a sufficient amount of money to employ 
at least one competent man and several clerks for their whole time in 
attending to this work, which is merely the collection, the organiza- 
tion, and sometimes the interpretation of material bearing on all 
topics of possible legislative interest. The use of this material by 
the members of the General Assembly would be bound to result in 
improved legislation—a consummation most devoutly to be wished. 
Not all the States, in fact, not many of them, have yet provided by 
specific appropriation for this work, but whether provided for or not, 
it should be undertaken by the State libraries, since they are the 
repositories of the documents of the various States of the Union and 
of the United States documents, from which most of the material used 
comes. The libraries that are engaged in this work are merely in a 
sense seriously undertaking to perform one of the duties which the 
founders of the State libraries had in mind—namely, the collection of 
material useful to members of the legislative departments of the State 
governments. 
In the next place, the State Library should conduct a system of 
traveling libraries especially provided for by an apropriation from 
the State. Most of the States of the Union now conduct such sys- 
tems, it being sufficiently recognized by our legislators that it is a very 
wise thing to provide in this way for sending a few books at least to 
places before destitute, in the hope of thereby stirring up sufficient 
interest to cause the people of the various communities to secure per- 
manent libraries for themselves. These libraries have accomplished 
a great deal of good in all the States, though in most the appropria- 
tion for the work is inadequate. In Virginia the system was inaugu- 
rated by the General Assembly with an appropriation of $7,500 in 
1906, and the annual appropriation since has been $1,800. With us 
the system is conducted as a part of the work of the State Library. 
In some other States it is also so conducted. In several States the 
system is under the management of the department of public instruc- 
tion. In most States it is under the control of a special Library Com- 
mission. I believe that it does not make a great deal of difference 
whether the work is done by the State Library or by the department 
of public instruction. I am slightly in favor of its being done by the 
State Library, since it is so attended to in Virginia, and we have met 
with good success. I am apposed to the formation of a special board, 
for the reason that I believe the work can be done more cheaply and
-P-A-G-E-89
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 89 
more effectively by the State Library. A further reason in Virginia 
for favoring the State Library as opposed to a special commission, is 
that the Virginia State Library Board is thoroughly non-partisan, 
being constituted, with this special object in view, of five members 
appointed by the State Board of Education, one member being 
appointed each year, to continue in office for five years. The libra- 
rian and the members of the staff of the library are appointed by the 
board “during the pleasure of the board,” which means, of course, 
that they hold office as long as their services are satisfactory. It 
would be almost impossible to secure another board in Virginia which 
would, under all circumstances, be non-partisan. This being so, 
political considerations might rule in the appointment rather than 
fitness. 
In the third place, from the State Library should also be sent out a 
library organizer, or possibly more than one organizer, whose duty it 
would be, by correspondence and especially by personal visitation and 
the delivery of addresses where occasion offered, to stir up such an in- 
terest in libraries throughout the State that those already in existence 
would become more active and new ones would be established. It is 
part of the duty of such an organizer to give advice where needed as 
to the best methods of selecting and buying books, arranging and 
cataloguing them, and as to any other details of library management 
about which inquiries may be made. Not infrequently it becomes 
his duty—or her duty, for the organizer is usually a woman—to spend 
several days, or perhaps a week, at a newly-opened library helping the 
librarian, if not an expert, to get the institution started in the right 
way, and in giving practical instruction. Of course, each library 
should have a properly trained librarian, and if the library be large, 
properly trained assistants, but it frequently happens that the pay is 
so small in the smaller libraries that these cannot be secured; and it 
is in such cases. that the services of the organizer are called into 
requisition. In order to do as much as possible toward the suitable 
training of the librarians of small libraries who have not had the 
advantage of a term at a library school or worked as apprentices in 
some regularly established library, the organizer in any State fre- 
quently holds an institute in the summer time at some place in the 
State—the State capital or the place in which is situated the State 
University or at some other place where access may be had to a 
well-conducted library—for the purpose of giving this training. The 
State organizer should, in my opinion, be a member of the staff of the 
State Library, for the same reasons as those already given in support 
of the conduct of the traveling library system by the State Library. 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  90 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Both the State organizer and the head of the traveling library system 
are engaged in library extension work, and should be associated as 
members of the same staff. Iam sorry to say that in Virginia, though 
we have a traveling library system conducted as a part of the work 
of the State Library, we have not yet, though bills have been intro- 
duced for this purpose in the General Assemblies of 1910 and 1912, 
succeeded in securing an appropriation for the employment of an 
organizer. The extension work of the library has to be done through 
the traveling library department and through correspondence con- 
ducted by the librarian’s office. We have a magnificent field in 
Virginia for the work of an organizer, and we shall renew our efforts 
at the next meeting of the Assembly. From all over the State we get 
information that here and there movements are being started looking 
to the inauguration.of new libraries. For example, on last Monday 
I received, from a lady in Waynesboro, Virginia, a letter to the effect 
that the traveling library sent to that place last August had so inter- 
ested the people that they had in various ways secured a permanent 
library of their own of six hundred volumes, and had finally induced 
the town council to vote to take advantage of the free public library 
law of the State, which permits any council of an incorporated town 
or city in the State to impose for the purpose of conducting a free 
public library a tax not exceeding one mill on the dollar on the 
assessed values in the place. Thus the town is in a fair way to secure 
adequate library facilities, and all this results from the use of one 
traveling library, backed up by a few suggestions made in letters 
written from the State Library. In the same way other permanent 
libraries have been established. 
In some States, amounts are regularly appropriated by the State 
to aid in the establishment of free public libraries, just as the State 
assists with its funds the local free public schools. Where this is 
done, the expenditure of the fund should be under the supervision of 
the State Library, and the books purchased should come from a list 
prepared by the State Library. In addition, the State Library 
should have imposed on it the duty of inspecting, from time to time, 
all such State-aided institutions. The work of inspection could be 
done by the library organizer, or an assistant. There is no such law 
as this at present operating in Virginia, but we have a somewhat 
similar law designed to encourage the establishment of permanent 
school libraries. By this law $2,500 a year is set aside from which 
a payment of ten dollars must be made to any public school whose 
patrons have raised fifteen dollars and whose school board has appro- 
priated fifteen dollars. The forty dollars is expended in the purchase
-P-A-G-E-91
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 91 
of books from a list of books made out by the department of public 
instruction. And the work seems to be well done. I, therefore, 
hesitate to say that it could be better done by the State Library, 
though as a general principle I think that it would be advantageous 
to have all the library work of the State done through one agency. 
Finally, a State Library should conduct an apprentice class, in 
which as many as possible of the prospective library workers of the 
State may receive at least a little training; and if conditions are 
suitable, it might also conduct a regular library school; but I am not 
strongly committed to this policy, believing that probably there are 
enough of these schools in the country already. 
I have so far enumerated the functions that should be performed 
by a State Library additional to those that should be performed by 
every great reference and circulating library, and into an examination 
of the latter I do not have time to enter. In conclusion, however, I 
wish to say that it seems to me that the State library ought to be the 
largest library in the State. It is owned by the people of the whole 
State, and not by any one class or section, and it should be of corre- 
sponding importance and usefulness. Those selected by the people 
to control its destinies should be expected to make of it a model in 
every respect. It should not only be the agency for the conduct of 
the library work of the State—that is, of the State government—but 
the leader in the library work of the people of the State. Someone 
has called the library “the university of the people,” and this is a 
good characterization, for in it any man or woman who so desires 
and who has the industry can secure information, and, more impor- 
tant than that, training, beyond the measure possessed by the master 
of arts or the doctor of philosophy. When knowledge becomes widely 
disseminated, as it will be so disseminated in time through the agency 
of properly conducted libraries, invidious class distinctions will dis- 
appear, and men will be valued in proportion to their intellect and 
character. Hence, the library may be called the “great leveler,” a 
title which has also been applied to death, since death lays all low 
alike in the dust. But the library is a more cheerful and a more 
inspiring leveler. It does not pull down, but in the ranks of the 
living its tendency is to elevate the lower to the same plane with the 
higher. The library, accordingly, is the institution par excellence 
for a democratic people. And of all the kinds of libraries, the State 
Library should be the foremost in the people’s interests and affections. 
Presipent Wuitrinip: I regret that it will be necessary for us to 
adhere strictly to the time limit which has been set for each paper 
and discussion.

I take pleasure in presenting to you Dr. D. A. Graves, Superintend. 
ent of City Schools, Chattanooga, Tennessee, who will read a paper 
on “The Backward vs. The Gifted Child.” 
Tue Backwarp vs. Tue Girrep CHILD. 
DEWEY A. GRAVES, CHATTANOOGA, TENN. 
For many years progress in educational theory and practice kept 
in view the normal child and the development of normal faculties. 
As long ago as 1872, Dr. William T. Harris, then superintendent of 
the St. Louis public schools, first directed public attention to the 
problem of the gifted child by introducing a plan for making promo- 
tions fit different intellectual rates of progress through the grades. 
Many years elapsed before much attention was given to children of 
varying mental conditions and attainments. 
During the last decade the literature relating to the backward, the 
retarded, the laggard, and the defective child has accumulated rapidly. 
Books have been written setting forth the data concerning these chil- 
dren in the different school systems. The educational journals and 
the press have frequently discussed them. Most of the recent reports 
of city school superintendents point out what is being done or what 
could be accomplished for them. More than this, State institutions 
for mentally and physically defective children have been established. 
Private enterprise has endowed others for the same purpose. Many 
of our enterprising public school systems have organized special 
classes and special schools for them. The slow and the dullard have 
shared in this special attention given to the child of low mentality. 
All for what purpose? To enable them to become self-respecting 
and respected citizens, to give them a chance to become self-sustaining 
instead of sustained by the public. 
The special effort given this group of children represents money 
and time well spent and should be continued. We must no longer 
neglect to give to that group of boys and girls who seem to possess 
the qualities of leadership ample opportunity for normal growth and 
development. For it is upon them, the leaders, that each generation 
must depend for the general uplift of the race and for advancement 
to a higher and better civilization for all. 
The problem of the gifted or talented child has hardly yet begun 
to attract attention. The literature upon this subject is limited 
indeed. Only a few school systems have attempted, as yet, to give 
this feature of the work special attention. Baltimore, Worcester, 
Indianapolis, Lincoln, and Rochester may be regarded as the pioneers
-P-A-G-E-93
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 93 
in recognizing the rights of the exceptionally gifted children by 
organizing special classes for them, though for some reason the 
Indianapolis schools have discontinued this practice. 
The gifted children are considered able to take care of themselves. 
The teacher too often is required to devote sixty per cent of her 
time to the lower third of the class, so they may be able to pass the 
grade on schedule time. But this leaves the upper third to drift 
along, knowing they will surely make it at the same time. Who 
knows but that in this group of bright children there may be the 
making of a man of genius? The individual needs of the children 
of exceptional ability are less adequately met in our schools today 
than those of any other class. If we consider the child who is 
habitually at the head of his class in the light of what he might have 
been, had psychological and educational principles been devoted to 
the development of his individual faculties, we may find him to be 
the most backward and undeveloped child in the room. 
The time was when we taught the school en masse, losing sight of 
individual attainments, thinking only of the progress of the whole. 
While the public school must never give up, as its chief function, 
the teaching and training of children in relatively large groups, yet 
provisions must also be made within the modern public school for 
training many children, not in groups, but as individuals. 
The individual soldier counts for more than he did. The great 
problem of the day is how to emancipate the individual from the 
mass. The increasing recognition of community interests and 
individualized educational treatment may be considered distinctive 
features of our American public school system. We are entering 
upon an era of personal achievements. The school system that does 
not recognize these principles in its administrative function must 
be relegated to the rear. 
The terms “backward” and “gifted,” as here used, indicate only 
the relative mental condition of the child. Both groups are usually 
found in the same class. Neither is defective. They may not have 
received a normal mental development, and therefore both may be 
retarded in their progress through the grades. That which may 
be a normal rate of progress for one may not be for the other. Any 
child who is not mentally developed up to the normal limit of his 
age is suffering from retardation. That rate or degree of progress 
which indicates retardation for one child may not be retardation 
for another. When the rate of progress through the grades is 
considered in terms of individual development, the necessity clearly 
arises for the public schools to provide for the gifted child as well
-P-A-G-E-94
94. SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
as for those of inferior endowment. A child will never make normal 
progress until he has opportunity to work up to the full measure 
of his powers. 
If the educational “lock-step” is to be broken and the individual 
given an opportunity to work up to his capacity, the question nat- 
urally arises: How many of the various groups of children are there 
in our schools? A recent government report shows that if all the 
children in our schools could be ranked according to their intellect- 
ual abilities, it is probable that a rough classification would group 
them about as follows: 
PRaenteg 2: ie Bk a SASS oe ae eee Four per cent. 
Bright and normal -------.---.- --Sixty-two per cent. 
Backward, retarded and laggards --Thirty per cent. 
Weeble-minded" sheet ee Ls el So Se Four per cent. 
    The talented and a part of the bright pupils would form an 
exceptionally gifted class, or about ten per cent of the whole, and the 
backward from twenty to thirty per cent. The problem of this 
paper, then, is to point out means for more effectively reaching 
thirty to forty per cent of our pupils. 
It is impossible to draw the line sharply between any of these 
groups of children. Minds that have shown the greatest strength at 
maturity often developed slowly in childhood. Others seeming to 
be quick, active, and alert in early childhood lose their mental grasp 
in later years. It often happens that the child in the backward 
group in early life may find himself in a few years in the bright or 
talented class, and the talented, later on, may take his place among 
the slow or the laggards. 
It is the backward children that cause most of the trouble in the 
schoolroom. They worry the teacher, because it seems almost 
impossible by any means to get them to bring their work to the 
required standard. They are idle, listless, troublesome. They 
don’t care. Make a study of any third or fourth grade as to their 
physical and mental development, and you will find the brightest 
children to be the smallest, and the largest will be the dullest. There 
are some exceptions to this rule. The over-age, over-grown, slow, 
sluggish pupils stand out in sharp contrast to the quick movements, 
mental alertness, eagerness and ambition of the smaller children. 
Let us consider for a few moments the alternating phases of the 
physical and mental development of these two groups of children. 
To handle these children intelligently, teachers must have a knowl- 
edge of the physiological condition operating to produce these vary- 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 95 
ing degrees of development. I cannot here enter into an exhaustive 
treatise of this subject, but desire, without dealing in technicalities, 
to call attention to some of the underlying principles responsible for 
this difference in mental and physical growth. Nerve currents 
control all the vital functions of the body. The nutrition and 
growth of every organ, gland, and cell in the body depends upon 
these nerve currents. The circulation and quality of the blood, the 
respiration and condition of the lungs, the temperature of the body, 
the normal or abnormal secretions of the glands, all depend upon 
this same nerve supply. A flesh wound will never heal, nor will a 
broken bone knit together if deprived of its proper nerve supply. 
This same nerve current is just as necessary to the healthy normal 
growth of the mental faculties and all the phenomena of conscious- 
ness, as it is to the physical. Not often during childhood and youth 
is this nerve supply evenly balanced between the mental and physical 
development. 
If during the period of childhood, the physical development is 
rapid and nearly all the nerve force of the body is required to nourish 
and build the bone and brawn, the fiber and tissue of the body, we 
cannot expect much mental activity in the class-room. These 
children are usually backward in every particular except physical, 
and even here they have grown so rapidly that they lack strength, 
stability, and the power to properly codrdinate their movements. 
They are retarded in their progress through the grades, diffident, 
bashful, easily humiliated, and they usually have a strong dislike 
for school. These children should never be placed in sharp competi- 
tion with those who, for the time being, are their mental superiors. 
By being conscious of continued defeat, children lose heart and 
become permanent dullards. They must somehow build their foun- 
dation of self-reliance. This must come, not by continued defeat, 
but by continued successes. Did you ever notice the glow of confi- 
dence that comes to one when he has made a discovery, and the dis- 
appointment when on the verge of the discovery the teacher points 
out the hidden mystery? If this class of pupils are given the 
proper attention, they can be kept in school; and when their mental 
development sets in, they often make rapid progress. It is from 
this group of backward children that large numbers of our most 
substantial professional and business men develop. 
On the other hand, the child may be experiencing a rapid mental 
growth and slow physical development. This group of children 
are in great danger of over-stimulation mentally, which often pro- 
duces a nervous breakdown and retards their physical development
-P-A-G-E-96
96 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
for many years. These precocious children are often the wonder 
of the neighborhood and the pride of the school. Later, when their 
physical development sets in at a rapid rate, they lose their energy 
and are counted lazy by those who do not understand. They are 
easily discouraged, and either drop to the lower third of the class or 
quit the school. And so it is that precocious children are seldom 
heard from in after life. Is it too much for us to expect that this 
class of children also need special attention and should be under the 
care of teachers who have a thorough knowledge of the mental and 
physical development of childhood? 
I have called attention to the precocious child that we may be 
better able to recognize the gifted child. A commission appointed 
by the United States Commissioner of Education to investigate the 
schools reported that geniuses and children of exceptional ability 
should be segregated in the public schools and pushed forward as 
rapidly as possible. Children should not be pushed through the 
grades as rapidly as possible. They should simply be freed from 
their environment and given an opportunity to work up to their full 
capacity. 
In the gifted child the balance between the mental and physical 
growth has been fairly well maintained. He cannot sustain: his 
position among his fellows without special natural gifts—strong 
will, resolution, application and prolonged attention. The child 
who is forced at home and in school and by a sort of hot-house 
method appears brilliant, must not be grouped in this class, for the 
apparent intellectual success is more than counterbalanced by the 
depleted nervous and retarded mental development. We must not 
develop students who are all head and no body. It is not somucha 
question of early graduation as it is of sufficient physical stamina to 
fight the battles of life after graduation. 
Gifted children are found among all classes. Too often in our 
schools they find themselves chained to the progress made by the 
normal child and more frequently to the pace set by the sub-normal. 
Ward says: “Difficult or impossible as it may be to forecast the 
talent of an untried mind, it is far more difficult and more certainly 
impossible to forecast its tastes and preferences. If we cannot select 
in advance the exceptional man, much less can we pick out for him 
his career. The only thing that can be done is to equalize opportu- 
nities, so as not only to enable the really exceptional man to demon- 
strate the fact, but to make the open avenues so numerous and so 
easy to travel that he will be sure to find the one to which he is best 
adapted by nature.”

The question of providing for the gifted children has been given a 
liberal interpretation by the superintendents of the fifty-four cities 
reporting such classes. In most cases this means merely that flex- 
ible plans of grading and promotions are in force which permit the 
unusually bright pupils to make more than normal progress through 
the grades. If I have made it sufficiently clear that children of the 
backward and gifted group should receive special attention, we may 
well consider briefly how this may be done within the school. 
      
  METHODS OF HANDLING THE MENTALLY BXCEPTIONAL. 
More can be accomplished to redeem the backward and promote 
the welfare of the gifted through the general organization of the 
school and the interested efforts of teachers in behalf of individual 
pupils than by any other means. 
In large cities “Special Classes” may well be organized. Some 
group their gifted pupils in the seventh grade and begin the study 
of Latin and modern languages. They are able to complete the 
seventh, eighth and ninth grades in two years, thus saving a year in 
high school. Others group the gifted pupils in the sixth grade. 
By being under the care of a strong teacher and being permitted to 
advance as rapidly as thoroughness permits, they are enabled to save 
a year by completing three years’ work in two. Pupils forming 
these classes are brought together in one central building. 
Equally as good results have been secured by grouping backward 
children. These children have grown out of harmony with school. 
They are not only forced to attend school; but by being classed with 
much younger pupils who surpass them mentally they become dis- 
uf:

couraged. By being grouped with pupils of their own age and 
given plenty of manual training, they become interested in school 
work and make reasonable progress in their studies. 
A system of Flexible Grading and promoting is used in many 
cities and towns to secure the same results. By this plan pupils are 
enabled to pass through the grades more rapidly and are promoted 
semi-annually or quarterly instead of annually. Here pupils are 
grouped according to their mental development. The slow do not 
then become a drag to the bright, and the gifted are not chained to 
the backward. 
Instruction before and after school. To be successful, a definite 
plan must be consistently pursued. It must be voluntary on the 
part of both teacher and pupil. 
Vacation schools under direction of the superintendent, so pupils 
may make up deficiencies. 
The Ungraded Room is used in many ways. The Chattanooga 
schools have used it with marked success to enable the gifted child 
to catch the division just ahead, and to give the pupil who is falling 
behind his grade an opportunity to catch up with the class and make 
the grade. The teacher should not have, at any one time, more than 
fifteen to twenty pupils in her room. Care should be taken not to 
crowd the room with dull pupils. The teacher’s time should be 
given to the bright pupil to enable him to do the best for himself. 
Pupils may be assigned to the ungraded room to remove deficiencies 
in one or more studies, performing all other work in their regular 
rooms; or, if mentally strong enough to do work of the next grade, 
they may be assigned to this room permanently until they have 
overtaken the grade. Children cannot skip a grade without decided 
loss to themselves. A room of this kind is not only a time-saver to 
the pupils, but a money-saver to the tax-payer; for it reduces 
repeaters and increases double promotions.

Ungraded rooms have not yet been organized in the schools for 
the negro race. In addition to the above, there were in the white 
and colored schools two hundred and thirty-three irregular promo- 
tions, mostly in the first and second grades. This was made possible 
by the desire and willingness of the teachers to give individual 
instruction to the over-age, late entering, bright pupils found in these 
grades.

minutes to address us on 
“TH BiBLE AND EDUCATION.” 
DR. WILLIAM DINWIDDIB, A.M., LLD., CLARKSVILLE, TENN. 
The education of the human race began in the garden of Eden, 
and it began with a lesson in obedience. The knowledge of good 
and evil was acquired, and the penalty for the method of acquisi- 
tion was the logical one of the continuation of that knowledge, and 
the evaluation by it of all personal conduct. 
The core of life not being mechanical skill, industrial efficiency 
or technical knowledge, it follows that the core of true dynamic 
education is not mechanical, industrial, technical, or even merely 
intellectual. These elements have their place, but are subordinate 
and contingent upon special aims, and therefore inadequate to solve 
fully the problem of education for the most efficient life-service. 
The vital factor in life is the ability to discriminate between good 
and evil, and to follow that which is good. Even the mechanical 
efficiency enthusiast admits the importance of character, and 
although some of the earmarks of the fad seem attached to present- 
day character-teaching, if we may call it that, yet the venerable 
truth of the determining power of individual character for any

kind of efficiency is appearing in clearer outline amid the maze of 
commercial, industrial and social ideals. Character being the vital 
aim of education, the Bible is therefore a vital factor, wherever 
education touches character and the springs of righteous human 
activity. This is true in history, in literature, in economics, in 
sociology, in politics, in philosuphy, in ethics, in religion—in all 
parts of the intellectual and social realms that have directly to do 
with the personality of man. 
The chief reason why the Bible is vital to personal efficiency is 
that it alone gives adequate knowledge of God. Short of this, 
there is no authority for moral law, no basis for ethics, no spring 
for righteous character. Schemes of moral education with God 
left out are as foredoomed to failure as were the atheistical vagaries 
of the French Revolution, an opinion corroborated by the actual 
experience of France and Japan. There is no adequate basis for 
ethical system short of the constitution of man in relation to God. 
A morality of merely human relations is possible, but without 
motive power, a headless body. No nation without the Bible has 
ever had a sound system of ethics. The Bible is the answer-book 
for the moral and social problems of life. In the Bible duty is 
demanded on the authority of God. Said a distinguished Ken- 
tuckian: “Without the firm convicton of a moral Ruler, there can 
be no such thing as moral laws.” A Japanese statesman said 
recently: “It is impossible to inculcate firmly, fair and upright 
ideas in the mind of the nation unless the people are brought in 
touch with the fundamental conception known as God, Buddha, or 
Heaven, as taught in religion.” The famous Count Okuma, of 
Japan, has ;this to say: “The fatal defect in the teaching of the 
great sages of Japan and China is that while they deal with vir- 
tues and morals, they do not sufficiently dwell on the spiritual 
nature of man, and any nation that neglects the spiritual, though 
it may flourish for a time, must eventually decay. The origin of 
modern civilization is to be found in the teachings of the Sage of 
Judea, by whom alone the necessary dynamic is supplied.” “Rea- 
son and experience,” said Washington, “both forbid us to expect 
that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious princi- 
ples.” Even Professor Huxley, was “perplexed to know by what 
practical measures the religious feeling, which is the essential 
basis of moral conduct, is to be kept up . . . without the use- 
of the Bible.” President Eliot has said that “Nobody knows how 
to teach morality effectually without religion. Exclude religion 
from education and you will leave no foundation upon which to
-P-A-G-E-101
  JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 101 
build character.” The National Teachers’ Association once passed 
a resolution that “the Bible should be recognized as the text-book 
of ethics, and that the Word of God, which made free schools, should 
hold an honored place in them.” “Who, at the foot of Calvary,” 
writes a great thinker, “can pronounce sin a slight matter?” As 
well attempt to teach patriotism without a country, as morals with- 
out a God. 
Because civilizaton has its roots in the truths of the Bible, 
because men have always found the sources of righteous motives 
in its pages, the onward tread of the nations and the great move- 
ments of history are fully illumined only to the Bible student. 
“The progress of Christianity,’ wrote a political philosopher, “is 
the progress of man.” “Whether the things believed are real or 
otherwise, it is certain that the beliefs of the Christian world are 
facts, are vital forces in the history of mankind. . . . It is 
also certain that these beliefs are among the most powerful of all 
the causes of human progress. . . . Hence the history of that 
progress cannot be truly told, or its causes explained, without an 
attention to the nature and the influence of these beliefs.” 
“It is through the Bible only,” said an English free-thinker, 
“that such people (that is, those without wide culture) attain a 
sympathetic insight into history.” 
How would one ignorant of Bible truths be taught the history 
of the Mayflower, Plymouth Rock, the Jamestown colony, Roger 
Williams, William Penn, the arguments, right and wrong, in regard 
to abolition? Where would be found truth enough to tie together 
the story of Puritan, Huguenot, Dutch, or sturdy Scotch-Irish gset- 
tlers, without the warp of their religious faith? The religious 
acknowledgments of our colonial charters, laws, and proclamations, 
and many later documents and practices, cannot be understood 
without knowledge of Bible teaching. 
Let us, for example, glance at some of the historic facts in 
England requiring knowledge of the Bible for their appreciation. 
The list is long, and the chain is interlinked at every point with 
the very life of the nation, and in this brief space only hints can be 
given. The influence of Augustine; the age-long fight between 
Christianity and paganism; the origin of the established church, 
often and again the storm-center of English national life; the vic- 
tory of English over Danish character; the secret of Alfred’s great- 
ness; of Dunstan’s power; the disappearance of slavery; the good- 
ness and wisdom of formerly savage Canute; the gentle reign of 
Edward the Confessor; the Christianizing of the Norman pirates

before reaching England’s shores; the care of the Conqueror for the 
church; the ultimate undermining of feudalism; the religious 
revival of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and the consequent 
moral uplift of the whole nation under Henry I; the crusades; the 
struggles between kings and popes, universities and church, barons 
and church; the friar revolution; Wycliff and the Lollards; the 
inception of Protestantism; Joan of Arc; the revival of letters; 
Erasmus, and the consequent stimulus to education; the times of 
Thomas Cromwell; the succeeding reformation; the martyrs; Eliza- 
beth and Mary Stuart; the final Protestantism of England—when, 
as Green says, “England became the people of. a book, and that 
book was the Bible;” when “there was one thing dearer to England 
than free speech in Parliament, than security for property, or even 
personal liberty; and that one thing was, in the phrase of the day, 
‘the gospel;’? then, the Covenant, with its far-reaching influence; 
Oliver Cromwell and his times; the Commonwealth and its spirit; 
the Conventicle Act and others of like aim; the imprisonment of 
Bunyan and its immortal result; the shifting dominance of varied 
religious beliefs during long years of struggle; can anyone not 
instructed in Bible teachings understand the history of England? 
Can anyone who does not understand the history of England under- 
stand that of America? 
Time fails even to mention like facts in the history of other 
nations—Germany, Holland, France, Spain, Italy, the Jews. Can 
we exclude from our study of history Christianity, the greatest 
force in the progress of the human race? Can we omit from our 
study of biography Jesus, the greatest character the world has 
ever known, and call what is left a fair historical education? Are 
teachers to be forbidden to explain the meaning of Anno Domini? 
History without knowledge of the Bible and its influence is a ragged, 
moth-eaten garment—all that is left of a rich fabric. 
Shall we give up Caedmon, Bede, Milton? Shall we syncopate 
Tennyson, Longfellow, Shakespeare, Whittier, Lowell, Bacon, 
Browning, Stevenson, Hawthorne, Macaulay, Coleridge, Arnold, and 
countless others, for lack of knowledge of the Bible and not under- 
stand hundreds of references and allusions? Shall we deprive our 
young men and women of the study of the best specimen of English 
undefiled, the most attractive narrative, the most majestic elo- 
quence, the noblest poetry of their native tongue at the behest of a 
handful of those who would offset with a few puny theories the wit- 
ness of the ages and the testimony of the great, the learned, the 
eloquent, the infidel ?

We are much concerned nowadays to educate for good citizen- 
ship. We can do no better than go to the Bible for our principles. 
“The powers that are ordained of God.” “Render to Cesar the 
things that are Cesar’s.” “Every soul” is to be “subject to the 
higher powers.” It is the Bible, too, that forbids civil rulers to 
dictate to the people in matters of religion, and the secularist him- 
self can defend his views only by a mistaken application of this 
very Bible truth, and can hardly hope to make his meaning clear 
to those not familiar with its teachings. “The studious perusal 
of the sacred volume,” said Jefferson, “will make better citizens.” 
Many of the most important of our laws are borrowed from the 
Old Testament. Justice Brewer has said that much of our common 
law can be traced back to some provision in the Mosaic code. 
“Upon these two foundations,” said Blackstone, “the law of nature, 
and the law of revelation, depend all human laws.” In view of the 
present widespread disregard of law in many parts of the country, 
what we need is not less Bible, but more. “Despotism,” says De 
Tocqueville, “may govern without faith, but liberty cannot.” 
According to the International Encyclopedia, “Religious educa- 
tion has been of the greatest importance in developing cohesive and 
powerful nationalities.” And in the struggle that followed the 
Reformation, “religious education was felt to be a means, not 
merely of furthering man’s eternal and spiritual welfare, but also 
of strengthening the State.” “The greatest need of Japan,” says a 
prominent Japanese statesman, “is said to be economic develop- 
ment; but the basis of economic development is confidence, and con- 
fidence will only come as the fruit of moral and religious education, 
based upon Christianity. Our need is Christian character, based 
on Christian education.” The testimony from those competent to 
speak for many nations, that the Bible is the only sure basis for 
civic, economic and social. well-being, is overwhelming. 
All that has been said argues irresistibly for the necessity of the 
Bible to any adequate system of education. The progress of Chris- 
tianity has been the progress of learning; it is in the countries 
enlightened by the Bible, and in them alone, that human knowledge 
has reached its high altitudes. “Among people who have a common 
religious faith,” says Compayre, “it is a matter of course that edu- 
cation should be connected with religion.” He speaks also of the 
gap which the school, in ceasing to interest itself in religious 
instruction, leaves, and quotes President Butler to the effect that 
we deceive ourselves if we believe that moral and civil instruction 
will “prove a satisfactory substitute for religious instruction.”  
-P-A-G-E-104
104 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The fact is, that the Bible has been read in our schools from the 
beginning, before the constitutions that some suppose to forbid it, 
were framed. It was fifty years before Wisconsin discovered that 
the use of the Bible was unconstitutional. We have agreed with 
President Schurman, that “no man can be wholly uneducated who 
really knows the Bible, nor can anyone be considered a truly edu- 
cated man who is ignorant of it.” The University of Toronto offi- 
cially decided that many of the subjects in the curriculum could . 
not be taught without use of the Bible. The French philosopher, 
Cousin, maintained that “education which is not specially religious 
is likely to be hurtful rather than beneficial.” 
England, Holland and Russia have schools under denominational 
control, subsidized by the State; Spain, Austria, Prussia, Sweden, 
Norway and Denmark allow religious instruction in the State 
schools under the supervision of the religious authorities; parts of 
Switzerland allow the use of the schoolhouse for religious pur- 
poses; France and Italy allowed time in the school program for 
religious instruction outside of the schoolhouse; our own National 
Education Association unanimously adopted a resolution in favor 
of both reading and studying the Bible in public schools; and the 
college entrance requirements in English for 1912-1915 include 
parts of the Bible. 
The truth is, those without Christian faith, or at least some 
appreciation of its power, are as competent to judge of the value 
and the necessity of religious training, as the untutored savage is 
to judge of the advantages of civilization. Those who after cen- 
turies of use are beginning to object, must show what changes in 
our national life and character call for such a severe and danger- 
ous surgery of the body politic. In spite of a much louder clamor, 
we continue to build battleships, equip armies, pay iniquitous pen- 
sions, and do many other things large and worthy of minorities 
opposition shall we, then, yield to the desires of those few specialized, 
it might almost be said sectarian, groups who happen to oppose 
the use of the Bible? Shall we continue to refer to God in consti- 
tution, oath, proclamation and coin; have chaplains in army, navy, 
prison and legislature; appoint days of national thanksgiving; and 
have in our schools no religious teaching to tell us what all this 
other. is for? 
Can we not penetrate below the surface of these questions as to 
the interpretation of the law, and the relation of the people who are 
the State to the same people who are the Church, and seek the 
deeper underlying reasons why the Bible must be taught and known,
-P-A-G-E-105
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 105 
since our history, our civilization, our national life, and those of 
other nations are what they are? Or must we take the denatural- 
ized, devitalized religion offered us by one high in the educational 
world, a weak tea that will hurt or help no one, a mere faith in 
cold science, the emanation of man’s mind, and substitute it for the 
faith in a living God that has been an actual moving power in the 
history of mankind? When that is done, man becomes his own 
God. 
The elimination of the Bible from education would be on a par 
with the Woman’s Bible, an edition omitting all certain women did 
not like; its very publication being a testimony to the power of the 
book, as well as to the folly of the women. Foolish women or 
learned men may edit away what is not to their taste, but the 
remainder is not the Bible; so may all trace of religion be removed 
from our school texts and our teaching, but what is left is not a 
whole education; it is mutilated remains. 
Without the knowledge of the Bible, literature and history are 
emasculated, modern civilization is unexplained, ethics is a castle 
in the air, character is without adequate impulse to righteousness, 
law lacks authority; government, high sanction, social service, lack 
the strongest motive; education, completeness. For centuries this 
book has been the spring of character, the bulwark of liberty, the 
warp of civilization. Shall we tear in shreds our past history, cut 
the heart out of our body politic, syncopate our education, sur- 
render a priceless heritage, and without hope for even a mess of 
pottage? 
The use of the Bible was prohibited once before in the history 
of the world, and the pent-up need for it burst forth into the great 
Reformation, amid the pangs of which modern civilization was 
born. God grant that we may soon see another such great Bible 
hunger. (Applause.)

TRAINING For Lire Work IN Our Rurau ScHoo.s. 
CHAS. C. THACH, LL.D., PRESIDENT ALABAMA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE. 
From the beginning the aim of education has been to prepare a 
man for his vocation. The particular vocation of supreme signifi- 
cance may have varied with the age, yet the aim of the system of 
schools has ever been the fitting of men for the dominant calling 
of the day, be it what it may. Schoolman, clergyman, lawyer, 
orator, soldier—has not each of the whole catalogue of the so-called 
learned professions dictated, in turn, the type of education? And 
now within the last half century has arrived the artisan, the doer 
of things as well as the thinker of thoughts—the farmer, the 
mechanic—demanding training for his own special life work. And 
today the most significant factor in our educational life is perhaps 
that education known as industrial. 
The aims, methods and results of this industrial education are 
frankly different from any of the older classical traditions of educa- 
tion. Openly avowed, its aim is to dignify manual labor and fit men 
for the practical business of life. As Mr. Huxley expressed it, it treats 
not only of man and his ways, but also of things and their forces and 
their value for the comfort of human life. It would not sup- 
plant the humanities, history, language, philosophy, art, litera- 
ture, but it would supplement them with chemistry, physics, agri- 
culture and mechanics. While training the intellect and the 
sensibilities and the imagination of the youth, it aims also to train 
the constructive and executive ability. It aims to teach how to do 
things, translating the intangible abstract concept of the mind into 
the concrete tangible things of the laboratory and the shop and the 
farm. Education, according to this view, is for physical welfare as 
well as for pure mental delight. To equip a boy or girl with the prac- 
tical profession, or trade, which places them upon their feet and as- 
sures an immediate livelihood ; to increase the production of economic 
goods in all of their forms; to understand and direct the forces of 
nature for the use and convenience of man; to contribute to the 
material, physical and comforts and happiness of man—these are a 
few of the practical aims of industrial education. Aims, that until 
within half a century, have not received the emphasis that their 
importance demands. 
All this, if you please, is commercial, industrial, material. “And 
truly, life, indeed, is more than meat and the body than raiment,” 
yet “for all the higher things of life there is needed a reasonable 
basis of material prosperity. Wealth is the soil for the roots of 
the tree of prosperity.”
-P-A-G-E-108
  108 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The object of this paper, however, is neither historical nor con- 
troversal, but merely to venture a few suggestions as to how this 
greatest of educational movements since the days of the revival of 
learning may be effectively incorporated in the schools of the coun- 
try regions throughout the South. ' 
The question is a tremendous one, one of far-reaching conse- 
quences, and its final solution can be accomplished only by great 
wisdom and equally great patience worthy of the highest type of 
educational statesmanship. ? 
Let us consider for a moment a few salient issues that are at 
stake, and the results that may be accomplished in this undertak- 
ing for the betterment and uplift of the agricultural element of our 
people. 
Though the gigantic increase of our urban population has caught 
the imagination of the nation with its colossal aggregations of 
skyscrapers and weltering acres of humanity, yet the fact remains 
that one-half of the eighty million people of the entire United 
States live in the rural regions, while one-third of the laborers of 
the Union draw their livelihood from the soil. In our Southern 
States over eighty out of every hundred of our poulation are classed 
as rural. Today the wealth of agriculture alone is equal to the 
combined capitalization of all the railways and manufacturing 
interests in America. Within the last fifty years agricultural 
wealth throughout the Union has increased five hundred per cent. 
Indeed, agriculture truly is the basis of the nation’s wealth. Not 
more than one man out of one hundred is a lawyer, a physician or a 
teacher, and while their interests are of gravest importance, yet how 
insignificant seems the welfare of any small segment of our popula- 
tion compared with the immense basal element of agriculture. | The 
problem of the rural school is indeed the problem of American civili- 
zation. 
And why should not this man with the hoe, these teeming chil- 
dren of the soil and their vast interests have equal consideration 
with the children and the interests of the more favored classes of 
our cities and villages. Enlightened selfishness—yea, the sense of 
self-preservation—challenges the best thought of all classes of our 
country in the solution of the problems that concern our agricul- 
tural population. 
I am one who believes in the sentiment voiced by the poet: 
“God made the country and man made the town.” 
The vigor and vitality of the cities themselves is largely depend- 
ent upon the constant stream of new red blood flowing from the
-P-A-G-E-109
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 109 
hills and valleys of our land into these great neurotic nerve centers 
of our highly wrought civilization. In one of our Southern cities, 
the wealthiest city per capita in the South, we are told that 154 out 
of 200 of its wealthiest citizens came originally from country homes. 
And surely, as ultimate consumers, all are concerned with the 
grave question of the ever-increasing cost of living—the high cost 
of living, or the cost of high living, as we may choose to phrase it— 
day by day, the question of supply and demand of the staple foods 
of life grows more and more critical. The man who goes to the 
market with the daily wage of twenty years ago brings back to his 
pantry a market basket only one-half full. We have all read in our 
college days the theory of Mr. Malthus, that population increases in 
geometrical ratio (2, 4, 8, 16, 32), while production in arithmetical 
ratio (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), and that starvation is the ultimate fate of an 
overcrowded world. But thanks to the magic of science and inyen- 
tion, commercial fertilizers and self-binding reapers and rotation 
of crops and the general mastery of the forces of nature by the 
ingenuity of man, the zone between demand and supply has been 
kept fairly broad, and open. But, without all exaggeration, the 
lines of supply and demand converge, the situation daily becomes 
more crucial, and it is of universal concern. 
President J. J. Hill, of the Great Northern, asserts that the rea- 
son for the high price of beef and pork and butter and eggs and the 
common necessities of life is, first, that too few people engage in 
farming, and, second, that those who are so engaged are illy pre- 
pared for pursuing the business (for farming is a business) with 
profit and with success. 
Quoting Mr. Truman S8. Vance: “Taking Virginia, which is char- 
acteristic of other Southern States and to some degree of all States 
having rural population, sixty per cent of the young men leave the 
farmers’ home altogether before they are twenty years old. Of the 
eighteen per cent that enter college and higher preparatory schools, 
enough come back to the country as preachers, doctors, school teach- 
ers and others to affect community life to some extent—and to 
reduce the net loss to fifty-five per cent, or to 11,000 each year. 
Added to the loss of over half the life blood of the country is the 
poverty of the blood that is left. With these conditions prevalent 
it is not strange that in the country today good roads, better 
schools and churches and community life in general suffer the blight 
of a half-settled country.” 
Only second in importance to this great shifting of cur people 
from country life to urban life is the well-nigh universal depletion
-P-A-G-E-110
  110 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
and impoverishment of the greatest material asset owned by the 
American people—that is our soil. With the prodigality of a 
spendthrift we have squandered the greatest legacy any people ever 
possessed, until today we are well-nigh bankrupt in fertility of soil. 
As some one has said: “We have mined our land rather than tilled 
it, and every brook runs crimson to the sea with the red blood of our 
butchered acres.” We have “skimmed the cream” and the inex- 
orable law of diminishing returns today confronts every farmer. 
The time was when “Uncle Sam,” as the saying was, was rich 
enough to give every man a farm; but the American pioneer has 
carried his frontier to the edge of the Pacific and well-nigh all 
available land above the margin of cultivation has been occupied, 
and today the Western farmer, by the thousands, is leaving his 
denuded acres and migrating from the United States into Alberta, 
Winnepeg and Saskatchewan. 
Such, briefly, in a fragmentary way, are some of the grave prob- 
lems of agricultural life that confronts us. They are of vast impor- 
tance and of national interest and come home to the besom of every 
American citizen. Surely, we are not pigmies, to lie supinely on 
our backs and say that nothing can be done. Knowledge yet has 
power. As I have said, it has been found efficient for the lawyer, 
the soldier, the physician and the clergyman, and surely the salt 
has not lost its savor, I take it, for the man on the farm. 
GENERAL EDUCATION. 
In discussing the question of education in the rural schools, I 
should insist that the first imperative need is a thorough general 
education. Behind the trade and the profession is the man. Every 
farmer is a citizen and he has both a soul and a country to save. 
The rural school must give the pupil an intelligent understanding 
for the honorable discharge of the various duties of life. A degree 
and range of information and intelligence are demanded by the 
exigencies and problems of agriculture which are hardly equal in 
any other occupation. 
And in this development of the American farmer, the little red 
schoolhouse of the olden day, with its old-fashioned course of study, 
wrought a mighty work. It brought marvelous prosperity and 
growth to the United States. Its widespread influences permeated 
American society. It made our nation the wealthiest and most 
productive of all the nations of the world. It brought thrift, 
mental alertness and elasticity, prosperity and culture to our people, 
and made Yankee ingenuity and resourcefulness a proverb through-

out the world. It has been the melting pot for the complete blend- 
ing of our polyglot elements. It has been and will ever be the 
great antiseptic against national stagnation and decay. English 
thinkers, like Mr. William Mather, assigned the greatest infiuence 
on American manufacturies to the general education of the Ameri- 
can boy derived from their common schools. The fundamentals 
of a common school education can never lose their value for train- 
ing the human mind. 
But times have changed, and the day for general education alone 
has passed, just as in manufacturing processes the day for the 
methods of “mere common sense” have given way to the methods 
of expert skill and science. “The ten thousand little red school- 
houses at the country cross-roads and their successors,” says Pro 
fessor Bailey, of Cornell, “have never taught the business of farm. 
ing.” But we know today that the business of farming can be 
taught in the schools. We know that culture and utility can be 
united, and the joining of these two hemispheres of life is the edu- 
cational problem of the day. 
. There is no occupation in the world today that calls for more 
ability and judgment, brains, training, industry and adaptability 
than farming. It is a man’s job. To plow and sow and reap 
without understanding is no more real farming than cutting a man’s 
leg off with an ax is real surgery.” 
No longer is the book farmer sneered at, but rather is the trained 
expert the accepted guide and teacher of the farming class. Agri- 
culture, today, is a science, the revelation having been brought 
about by the agricultural college and experiment station established 
some fifty years ago. By their painstaking observation of facts 
and careful and accurate interpretation of the laws of nature on an 
enormous scale, there has become available an immense body of 
precise information concerning the principles that govern soil fer- 
tility, plant life and animal life, the three cardinal elements in the 
business of farming. Moreover, this body of knowledge has been 
gradually reduced to pedagogical form until today there exists quite 
an adequate amount of agricultural text and literature for use in 
our common schools. 
Granting the need and desirability of introducing industrial edu- 
cation in our common schools, many practical questions suggest 
themselves. First, shall we have separate vocational schools, or 
shall agriculture and mechanic and domestic science be introduced 
as elements in the courses of the entire common school system? 
Forcible arguments are presented on either side. My own State of
-P-A-G-E-112
    112 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
Alabama was the first State in the Union to establish a system of 
congressional agricultural schools, there being at present nine such 
institutions in the State. They have already done excellent work 
and are rapidly becoming the type of industrial school for which 
they were originally intended. However, recognizing as I do the 
value of the separate agricultural school, the weight of argument 
in the matter as a whole seems to lie entirely in favor of the com- 
bined or cosmopolitan school. The accessibility of the vocational 
school to children right at their own doors is a highly important 
matter. “What does it mean for the future of the country,” it 
has been asked, “when boys and girls who advance beyond the 
grammar grades have to go into town to get their high school edu- 
cation? At the most impressionable age they are trained in the 
habits of the town. The fundamental duties of the common school - 
will be to enable the child to sleep in his own bed and eat at his 
own breakfast table until the age of eighteen and yet receive an 
adequate education. This means that the school should teach both 
industrial subjects, as well as those subjects that interpret to the 
children the beauty and the inspiration of God’s great outdoors.” 
COURSE OF STUDY. 
The subject-matter for a practical definite course of industrial 
training lies immediately at hand. The principles of agriculture, 
horticulture, floriculture, carpentry, basket-making, all forms of 
nature study, habits of birds and plants and fish, why plants grow, 
how plants grow—all these can be taught, all being of infinite inter- 
est and of direct practica! value. 
And to accomplish the greatest good with these subjects they 
should be introduced into the upper elementary and the grammar 
grades, for, as we know, only a minute fraction of the children 
remain in school beyond the eighth grade. 
The college of agriculture, the experiment station, bulletins, 
farmers’ institutes, are all valuable—indeed, absolutely indispensa- 
ble—but the real work of regenerating our agriculture and our 
mechanical trades must begin with our children. 
And there seems to me ample time for the introduction of these 
new subjects in our courses of study. As things stand, we have 
erected a stupendous educational scaffolding for our children. In 
my opinion, and I am ready to defend the thesis, the preparation for 
life work, as it is given today in our elementary and secondary 
schools and colleges and professional schools, could with profit be 
reduced a third of the time.
-P-A-G-E-113

Let us have less of cube root, less of certain forms of geography, 
less of superficial physiology, less of story telling and idling of 
time, less of stocks and bonds and bank discount, ete., and we can 
readily find place for studies that will put more cream in the churn 
and more beans in the bin; that will inculcate a genuine love and 
appreciation of the rich delights of the farm and countryside; that 
will create a spirit of devotion to country life rather than aliena- 
tion, thus serving to check the cityward exodus of our country boys. 
PRACTICAL WORK. 
And the problem of practical work for school agriculture is rap- 
idly finding solution. The school garden, the village plat system, 
the large farm system of the Christian Brothers at Lincolndale, 
New York, and the Jewish National Farm School near Philadelphia, 
the agricultural high school system of experiment stations and 
farms are all successful efforts in the right direction, but the 
supreme movement for practical work for all schools and especially 
for the rural schools, is the organization of boys’ corn clubs, boys’ 
pig clubs and girls’ canning clubs. The success of this movement 
has been marvelous. It permeates the remotest regions and has 
met signal success in the very smallest schools. The laboratory is 
a boy’s own home, the boy’s own farm; the girl’s own home and the 
girls’ own tomato patch. It is organized rural life on the spot. 
It is the thing itself. It shows the boy and girl that farm life 
pays. It enlists their interest and throws the center of gravity to 
the country rather than to the city. It is the great antidote against 
the call of the crowd and the lure of the limelight. In one South- 
ern State, for instance, there are eleven thousand boys thus organ- 
ized and over three thousand girls, the average yield of corn having 
been raised in this industrial army of the young from eighteen to 
forty-six bushels per acre; over one hundred of them averaging 
over one hundred bushels to the acre. The gospel is good seed, 
good fertilization, good cultivation; and the fruits of this gospel— 
good crops, prosperity and happiness and content on the farm. 
The slogan of this movement is not so much, “back to the farm,” as 
“stay on the farm.” 
MANUAL TRAINING. 
Another highly important factor of practical work that should 
be undertaken by rural schools is manual training. 
Truly one of the most imperative needs of the South today is a 
mechanical sense—the ability to utilize machinery and labor-saving 
devices.

           SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 114 
How many farmers in any community are able to apply to their 
own business the beneficial results of improved farm machinery, or 
recent discoveries in practice of farm life? And what shall be said 
of the lack of mechanical conveniences about the home or in the 
kitchen? 
On every hand there is a most urgent demand for skilled labor, 
the supply being entirely inadequate. Yet only the most meager 
facilities are available for white youths in the South for learning 
these excellent arts and crafts of the hand that really make up the 
higher material expressions of a people’s civilization. 
We advocate this training for the negro. We advocate it for 
the incorrigible white; but, I ask, do we desire that the door to 
all this fine form of mechanical labor shall be forever closed to the 
great masses of our intelligent and worthy youths? 
With the development into electrical energy of the water power 
along the foothills of the piedmont escarpment, the South seems to 
offer a wonderful field for the application of mechanical, indus- 
trial skill. Shall we leave for others to enter in and take posses- 
sion of this legacy, or shall we train our own sons for these great 
possibilities? 
Why may not the day come when we shall see the work of the 
home and farm yard done by electric motors—chopping the food 
supply for thie cattle, pumping the water, driving the sewing 
machine, swinging the churn and rocking the cradle—thus sup- 
planting the hand that rules the world. 
Wood work or carpentry will be the form of manual training 
most readily developed for the boys, the equipment being inexpen- 
sive and readily supplied. The chief obstacle to the immediate 
progress of this movement of industrial education, as we know, is 
the lack of properly trained, competent instructors; but the obsta- 
cle is not insurmountable. The agricultural colleges, normal 
schools and agricultural high schools are already remedying the 
defects, and the widespread demand and handsome salaries offered 
for vocational teachers will inevitably bring supply. 
A prosperous, intelligent and contented rural population—this 
is a thing desired. 
A forty-acre farm—not a large plantation with careless ten- 
antry; every man under his own vine and fig tree; crops well tilled; 
cattle and horses fat and with silken flanks; pigs and poultry of 
the finest; a neat schoolhouse on the hill, with good teachers with- 
in; a cozy church near-by; good roads stretching off to neighbors 
not too far away or to market; rural delivery; rural telephones; a
-P-A-G-E-115
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 115 
house full of the air of comfort and newly painted; children and 
housewife intelligent, busy, thrifty, happy—this is the ideal of our 
Southern country regions, a rural democracy. 
And with proper attention to the preparation of the boy and 
the girl on the farm for life work on the farm, the ultimate con- 
summation of this ideal can surely be accomplished. 
“Tl fares the land to hastening ills a prey 
Where wealth accumulates and men decay. 
Princes and lords may flourish or may fade; 
A breath can make them as a breath has made. 
But a bold ‘yeomanry,’ a country’s pride, 
When once destroyed can never be supplied.” 
Dr. Wuirrisip: I believe if the people of this beautiful city knew 
what a remarkable speaker would be at this place tonight, that this 
splendid auditorium would not be sufficient to accommodate the 
audience that would be here to greet our next speaker. 
It affords me unusual pleasure to present to this audience Dr. 
Warren H. Wilson, Superintendent of the Board of Home Missions 
of the Presbyterian Church in New York City. Iam sure, after you 
have heard Dr. Wilson, each one of you will consider it not only the 
feature of this meeting, but one of the greatest speeches that it has 
been your pleasure to listen to. Dr. Wilson will now address us.

Socra, anD EpucationaL Survey IN THE CountTRY. 
WARREN H. WILSON. 
Two years ago I was assigned to the task of studying the country 
church with a view to bettering its condition. In all denominations 
the country churches have been suffering. The condition is well 
represented in the churches of one denomination in Iowa. Among 
these, the country churches constitute one-fifth of the whole number, 
but upon them must be spent about one-half of the missionary money 
that should be sent to Africa and to India. Why are these country 
churches in an ‘agricultural State coming into the position of 
mendicancy? 
The country situation has on its surface certain things well 
known. Everybody can tell you that the country minister is not 
paid a sufficient salary. Everybody knows that the country school 
is inefficient and unsuited to the present needs of country people. 
It is also a commonplace among us that young people in the country 
do not have recreation or social life adequate to their needs. But
-P-A-G-E-116
  116 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
these things cannot be remedied by exhortation. It does no good 
to tell country people to pay their ministers more salary, to give 
their children more play and to modernize their schools. This is 
about as effective as it would be to advise a woman troubled with 
insomnia that she should sleep it off! Before a remedy can be pre- 
scribed, a thorough study must be made of the whole situation. This 
we have set out to do. 
We have, therefore, made social surveys in which we have recorded 
the social forces and institutions. These stories describe conditions 
in seven counties in Pennsylvania, three counties in Indiana, three 
counties in Missouri, one in Kentucky, one in Tennessee, one in 
Maryland, and we are just now completing the study of twenty-one 
counties in Ohio. It is our purpose to survey the whole -State of 
Ohio, including eighty-eight counties. 
The first thing we find in the country is the well-known inde- 
pendence of the countryman. This, like everything else to be discoy- 
ered through careful study, is already somewhat well known. The 
value of a survey is to record and to measure the conditions which 
people know; to verify them and to describe them in such a way 
that the worker can deal to advantage with the conditions he already 
_ knows. I will say no more about this individualism which prevails 
in the country as nowhere else, except this, that it is obviously a 
resource as well as an obstacle. Whatever is done among country 
people must not overturn the individualism of the American farmer. 
The homestead is the source of this so well-known trait. Loneliness 
of living isthe cause of it. Apparently it is at its highest in the 
mountain regions, where men have few neighbors and no roads at all, 
but it is universally present among country people who live in home- 
steads apart from one another. It has given character to American 
life, and we must learn how to preserve it as well as to rob it of the 
power to prevent codperative action. 
The second fact disclosed in the rural survey is this: that the 
only type to be found generally in the country is the working farmer. 
There was a time when the merchant, the lawyer, the judge, the 
minister, the school teacher, the writer of books, the blacksmith, the 
factory worker, lived with the farmer. But all these have been 
gathered now in the towns, and, generally speaking, throughout the 
United States one can rely upon only the working farmer as a type to 
be discovered in the country. This fact of itself explains a great 
deal of the difficulty of doing religious or educational work in the 
country. No church can get on with a solitary type. One would 
not desire to be the minister of a church made up of women, or a
-P-A-G-E-117
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 117 
church made up of men, or of students, or of mechanics alone; and 
it is similarly difficult to maintain a church where farmers are the 
only type of men to work with. 
This industrializing of the country has expelled, through the 
strain of farm labor, all leisure, recreation and indolence from the 
country. Until the farmer has attained an income that will enable 
him to be, as he must be, a consumer of goods as well as a producer, 
the present industrial strain will continue and will be increased. 
The old-fashioned farmer lived on his products. The present-day 
farmer lives off his profits, and until he have a profit adequate to a 
good living, the strain of industrializing the country will continue 
to expel from country life the graces of recreation, of leisure and of 
ease. 
The third element in the country survey is the low productiveness 
of this farm labor. American farmers are not able to supply, for 
_ the days to come, the growing American wants. Year by year our 
exports, which have been of huge dimensions under the heads of 
grain and other farm products, are diminishing, and the time is soon 
to come when we will be an importing nation, sending out gold and 
taking in grain. Remembering that our soil is but young, and not 
all of it as yet under cultivation, it is a shameful comment upon 
American inefficiency that we are losing our ability to feed ourselves. 
For instance, it is asserted by a leading agriculturist born and 
reared in the State of Missouri, that that State probably does not 
produce a total of farm products equal to its own needs. In other 
words, Missouri, a great farming State, does not, he asserts, feed 
itself. 
The fourth discovery in the country survey is the lack of an 
adequate income. Now, I know that people say the farmer is the 
man who is making the money. Indeed, there are farmers in favored 
regions in some numbers who are receiving a return for their work 
equal to five hundred, one thousand, fifteen hundred or two thousand 
dollars per year. This is especially true in recent years. But 
these men do not constitute the majority of the population, and 
farming is that kind of an industry in which every worker, since he 
produces the necessities of life, ought himself to have enough for his 
necessities. The actual fact is, as shown by investigations in various 
parts of the country, that one-third to one-half of the farmers investi- 
gated are paying out of their own pockets for the privilege of work- 
ing on the land. That is, in Tompkins County, New York; in 
Wayne County, Ohio; in Pike County, Missouri, we found that one- 
third to three-sevenths of the farmers, after they had paid all fixed  
-P-A-G-E-118
    118 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
charges against their land and interest on their investment, had left 
over as a wage for the farmer himself a minus quantity. In other 
words, their gross income from farming was not equal to five per 
cent on the capital invested. They could at any time sell the farm 
in these regions, where there are many buyers, put the money in the 
bank or at mortgage, and make more money by idleness than they 
can by labor. These men had no labor income. Now, the presence 
of such men in country communities depresses the whole economy. 
‘Where some get no pay, all live in fear. 
Moreover, we find in the country that the men who do make money 
belong to the miser class. The qualification that equips a man to be 
a successful farmer, above all things, is the ability to avoid spending 
money on anything whatever. The miser is on the margin of success 
in the country. He is officer. in all our churches, he dictates the 
policy of country social institutions, he controls the school board, 
because he is the characteristic successful farmer. 
Generally throughout the country we find, in the fifth place, that 
the price of land is going up while its productiveness is diminishing. 
The farmer’s income may be somewhat increased, though I think it 
generally is not in average instances, but the increase in the selling 
price of farm land enables the countryman to borrow more at the 
bank. His credit has improved, though his income has not im- 
proved. Now he can buy productive improvements on credit, 
because productive improvements are used to enrich and increase the 
property against which the loan is made. But social improvements 
cannot be paid for on borrowed’ money. They can only be paid for 
from a man’s own money, his wages or his profits. No minister can © 
ask his countrymen to increase his salary, however much it be needed, 
by the mortgaging of their property. In other words, social im- 
provements both of the church and of the school cannot be paid for 
on borrowed money: they can only be paid for out of profits or 
labor income. Mind you, this has nothing to do with maintenance. 
I am speaking only of improvements. The farmer cannot have better 
schools or better churches until he has a better income. 
All this prepares us to understand why, in the sixth place, the 
numbers and proportions of renters have so increased on American 
land. On all the good land throughout the country, with certain 
well-understood exceptions, the farm renter is increasing. In 
Illinois and Iowa, where the soil is of priceless richness, the farm 
renter is now more than one-half the population of the open country. 
In the Gulf States the proportion of renters is fifty-five to sixty-seven 
per cent of the population, and in certain counties the proportions
-P-A-G-E-119
  JOURNAL OF PROOBEDINGS. 119 
are even greater. In Tennessee about one-half of the farmers are 
renters. Now, this is a condition known to none of our law-makers. 
In this last election you heard of the farm renter from none of the 
political prophets, yet he is the biggest figure in the country situation 
in America. He has more influence on the churches than all of the 
ministers combined, and his influence is not good. He is a bigger 
educational problem than the school teacher herself. 
The reason of his importance is this, that in all parts of the 
country the American farm tenant has but a one-year’s lease on the 
land. The European tenant has practically a life lease. In Ireland, 
whose woes have been heard of all over the world, the renter cannot be 
evicted, but the American renter does not want a permanent lease, 
and the landlord does not mean that he shall have it, because the 
price of land is changing, and it would not do to encumber or to 
compromise the sale of land by a long-time renter. 
The renter is too independent, moreover, to think he will always 
be arenter. Indeed, he becomes an owner very often, but the survey 
discloses that schools and churches in the country have the same 
proportion of renters year after year to deal with, while some become 
owners and some become laborers. The renters are a shifting class 
who constitute the hardest problem of the church and the school in 
the country. 
None of the states has laws on the renter. The rights of the land- 
lord are not protected by any State laws of which I have heard. 
Legislators, without exception, have refrained from writing into the 
laws of state or nation any mention of the farm renter, who con- 
stitutes four-tenths of the farm population in America. The result 
is that the American renter and the American landlord are both 
outlaws. I do not use too severe a word, for an outlaw may be a 
bad man in revolt against good laws, or a good man in revolt against 
bad laws. The American renter and landlord belong to the latter 
class, but nevertheless they are outlaws, and you cannot build a 
church or construct an educational system upon outlaws. There 
was no chapel and no school in Robin Hood’s band. 
Men tell me that the buyer in the country under these new condi- 
tions of higher prices is usually a foreigner who is willing to work in 
the ditch, to live very cheap, to work his wife in the field and his 
children in the furrow. This enables me to say that the American 
country church is an institution of a high, not a low, standard of 
living. When farmers must work their wives and children in the 
field, the churches which I represent will be closed forever. Bap- 
tists, Methodists, Episcopalians, Presbyterian, Reformed and other
-P-A-G-E-120
  120 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Christian churches that have an open Bible and a learned ministry 
are the exponents of a high standard of living. I plead for. the 
maintenance in the country of a decent mode of living for people 
whose wives and children do not need to work on a family income. 
We have such standards in our cities. If we lose them throughout 
the country, then the American country school and the American 
country church will be at am end. 
The survey discloses, in the seventh place, that the school teacher 
and the preacher, social agents on whom the community must depend 
for its higher life, are absentees. Like the landlord, they live in 
town. The school teacher usually comes out to the one-room school 
on Monday morning, wearing city clothes and thinking city thoughts, 
to teach for a little while in the country school, that she may get a 
job in some city. The minister in most of our country communties 
lives where he does not preach and preaches where he does not live. 
As a result of the circuit rider system, the minister in the country 
is an absentee. The circuit rider lived with the farmers. The 
modern minister almost universally, who preaches in the country, 
lives in the town, but the towns cannot have enough churches to give 
every country preacher a congregation there. So that, throughout 
the South and Southwest, every town that has one Methodist church 
with its pastor has three or five or seven or twelve Methodist min- 
isters in residence there, who preach in all parts of the country round- 
about, sometimes at a distance of sixty miles. The same is true of 
the Baptist, Presbyterian and Disciples, and other churches. Every 
town that I know in Missouri with more than one thousand people 
has more than five ministers to every pastor of each denomination. 
The ministers are all clustered in the towns, and their churches are 
all dispersed over the open country. This is a very sad situation, 
and unless it is remedied I can see no hope for the country home- 
stead with its precious treasure of independence of character. The 
very evangelism with which these men profess to bless the country— 
a mouthful of words about personal salvation and no ties to bind it— 
will in itself disappear from religious significance, if we lose the 
country homestead, in which alone the independence and integrity 
of American character have had their present development. 
I have just time to commend what seems to me to be the remedy, 
though it is not discovered by the survey, except in certain favored 
and forward-moving regions. . It is farm codperation. We need 
in every part of the country factories in which farm produce now 
shipped away in the raw, shall be manufactured by the farmer into 
consumers’ goods. For instance, every milk section should sell
-P-A-G-E-121
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 121 
not milk by preference, but butter. Farmers should not sell hogs, 
but bacon. Farmers should not sell raw fruit by preference, but 
should build their own canneries for the preserving of fruit in order 
that in all these cases the farming community may retain the wages 
and the profits of manufacture. 
Moreover, the farmer who sells a raw product must ship it at once. 
He cannot keep milk over night. It would spoil. He cannot keep 
a fat steer or hog much beyond the day when he is in perfect condi- 
tion. Therefore, the farmer has no margin for dickering or trading. 
He must sell to the first buyer who comes along. This means that 
the farmer takes the price that is offered him and has nothing to say 
in fixing the price of what he produces. A more helpless condition 
could not be imagined than this one. Factories for the keeping of 
farm products at home until they are in shape to be stored and 
marketed at the proper time would give the farmer a hold on his own 
industry. 
Similarly, codéperative banks are needed in the country in order 
that farmers’ sons and farm laborers and farm tenants may have 
the means of purchasing farm land within their own capacities to 
pay forit. So long as interest is at five and six per cent the present 
methods of farming in many parts of the country do not enable the 
farmer’s son to buy a farm and pay for it out of his labor. President 
Taft’s letter to the Governor is a statesmanlike document that will 
long be remembered, because it deals with codperative credit among 
farmers. The Southern Commercial Congress is doing admirable 
work in calling attention to European systems of credit and of rural 
coéperation. The service they are rendering will enrich the farmers 
in all parts of the country by giving them a grip on their own 
business. 
The social survey gives a comprehensive and a verified knowledge 
of country life. Its results should not lead to pessimism, though 
the picture is not showy or attractive. There are forces at work in 
all parts of the country which are securing fundamental results. I 
am convinced because of the leaders who are devoting their lives to 
this great enterprise, that a new country life will come in time to 
enable the American farmer to retain his land, and with the land to 
maintain the institutions characteristic of American society; pri- 
marily, the country church and the country school, which express 
our national character as no other institutions have ever done.

PaTRIOTISM AND EpucATIONAL SERVICE. 
DR. J. H. KIRKLAND, NASHVILLE, TENN, 
Yesterday the American people was called on by the Chief Mag- 
istrate of our nation to render thanksgiving for national peace and 
prosperity. On such an occasion our hearts are stirred by ser- 
mons and addresses. Our minds recall the history of our past— 
the deeds of our heroes, the permanent service of our patriots. 
And in the midst of it all we hear a call from the world of today, 
from the people all about us, for the service demanded by these 
strenuous days of 1912. One era is a military one—the call is for 
valiant troops, for leaders of military genius, for a hand of steel 
and a heart of stone. Another age calls for pioneer enterprise— 
for men who hear the call of the wild, who carry their country’s 
flag into remote wildernesses. Another age calls for power of 
organization—for law givers, for constructive statesmanship. And 
so each age sounds a new call and each day brings some new duty. 
The changes in our public and private life have been constant 
and rapid. We do not,need to go back into ancient history. We 
may find sufficient contrast between the life of today and the 
days of our childhood. Our homes are new in almost every detail, 
our domestic economy is altered, our apparel is changed—not in 
fashion only, but in every detail of manufacture and composition. 
Changes have taken place in every line of labor. The farmer of 
today has his planters, reapers, binders, threshers and cultivators. 
He uses a new vocabulary, he lives in a world of new duties and 
experiences. Our cities are climbing to the sky. The very face 
of the earth looks up to the stars with a new expression. A gold 
dollar may be practically unchanged since fifty years ago, but most 
evidences of wealth—stocks and bonds—are now issued on forms 
of capital practically unknown half a century ago. You who think 
wealth stable and permanent, watch how it ebbs and flows, mobile 
as the sea, before the march of intellect. 
And these changes are not merely on the surface. They reach 
deep into the heart of society and have affected the history of every 
national government. If an angel had announced one hundred 
years ago the great scientific changes in store for the world, how 
the strength of one man was to be equal to that of ten, who would 
not have believed the millennium to be approaching? But has hap- 
piness increased? Was ever poverty so deep, wealth so grinding, 
or power so remorseless as today? The socialist comes for- 
ward boldly with a program for a new form of government and a

t 
new order of society. Under the cover of darkness the red flag 
of anarchy is raised in the very center of our cities. Our great 
republic renews its appeal to every citizen. Not to the consuls 
alone, but to every man who loves his country has the order gone 
forth to see to it that no harm comes to the State. Can American 
character stand the severer test to which it is now to be subjected? 
Can we meet the new conditions that have arisen in the life of 
today? Obedience to law and respect for authority do not sum up 
the demands made on us now. We do not stand aloof looking at 
government as an outside agency of external control. We have 
learned rather to regard it as the expression of our own highest 
activities. The true citizen of today is called on to make positive 
contributions to the work of government. Modern democracy 
means the application of comprehensive plans and efforts on a 
large scale at public expense under public supervision for the pro- 
motion of human welfare. The interest of the organized state is 
the interest of society as a whole. From this point of view it is 
clear that the duty of the citizen does not end with the casting 
of a ballot, no matter how honestly or intelligently. It involves 
further interest in and study of all social and civic problems and an 
effort to make such study an effective factor in influencing legisla- 
tion. 
There is room here for all kinds of activity, but in this gathering 
and on this occasion our attention is turned particularly to edu- 
cational tasks. These are frequently interpreted solely in relation 
to the life and development of the individual child, but they can 
also be expressed in larger units, in terms of a nation’s life and 
growth. The commonplace daily tasks of the humblest teacher 
widen out until they grip the foundations of society and of gov- 
ernment. The most important business the State is engaged in 
is that of keeping school. As a nation we are erecting state- 
houses and halls of government, but more important than these are 
the schoolhouses we are building. We are building dreadnaughts 
and superdreadnaughts, but greater than these are the universities 
we are supporting and enriching. The future of the republic 
rests with the teachers of the country rather than with its soldiers 
or its sailors. The South has never been engaged in a task more 
heroic than in its struggle of the past forty years against the curse 
of illiteracy. No patriots have arisen in all our history more 
devoted to the public welfare than the workers in this holy cause. 
There was little in it to fire the imagination or excite the blood. 
There was no waving of banners, no sound of martial music. It

was a dead uphill pull against a dead weight. It was a fight not 
only against darkness and ignorance, but also against Southern 
prejudices, for the system of public education meant a care for the 
black child as well as for the white child. We have worked faith- 
fully and with good results in this our appointed task. We have 
taken no step backward. But have not yet reached the hour for 
resting nor for self-congratulation. Along the lines of past 
endeavor much yet remains to be done. There are many children 
outside of school altogether, and many more whose attendance is so 
fitful as to defeat the purposes of it all. There are large sections, 
whole counties, resting complacently under the curse of illiteracy. 
To us, educational workers, whose lives are involved in the success 
or failure of this task, existing conditions appeal with profound- 
est significance. Are we not trustees for the State? Are we not 
the guardians of childhood? Is there not a service for us to ren- 
der, a field all our own in which our patriotism can express itself? 
We know that the children of the South, especially the white chil- 
dren of backward sections, will not be rescued from illiteracy until 
the State forces them into the schools. We are familiar with the 
history of educational laws in other countries and other States. 
Academically, we are all on one side, but what are we doing about 
it? We are leaving the task to a few consecrated workers. We 
have given them a hearing in our discussions, but we have not aided 
them in getting laws enacted. If the members of this Association 
were really in earnest in the matter, really fired with a burning 
zeal, consumed with a soldier’s love of country, we could in two 
years secure all needed legislation on this subject in every Southern 
state, There is no one to combat us in our efforts. The forces 
to be overcome are indifference and inertia, not active opposition. 
So much the greater is our condemnation for our sins of omission. 
But there are other tasks waiting for us. Much of our work in 
this matter of public elementary education must be done over 
again. We have idealized the little red schoolhouse beyond its 
deserts. Too often it is a little black schoolhouse, dingy with 
age and dirt. It is too small for comfort, or would be if it were 
attended by those who are due there. The teacher who rarely 
remains longer than one term has generally had an insufficient 
academic preparation, no professional training, and is overwhelmed 
with a load of twenty-five or more classes each day. It has taken 
a long while, but we have at last learned that such a school does 
not educate, that it positively endangers the health of the pupils, 
and that it wastefully consumes resources collected with great
-P-A-G-E-125

  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 125 
difficulty. We have also learned that there is a better way. In 
the past decade the movement for school consolidation has received 
a fresh impulse. Officers of bureaus at Washington, officers of 
various states and counties, school officials in great number, have 
lent their influence to this work. The Southern Education Board 
is throwing all its strength and influence into this field, under the 
able guidance, first, of Mr. Wickliffe Rose, and, later, of Mr. A. P. 
Bourland. But the roll of honor here includes many more than 
these. Mr. Brogden’s pamphlet, issued a year ago from Superin- 
tendent Joyner’s office, is a splendid contribution to this work; 
so are the reports of Mr. Tate, of South Carolina, and other State 
supervisors. Further assistance in this task has been rendered 
by every school teacher who has lifted his voice in some rural com- 
munity for better school and community life, and by every leader 
who has shown how to do something to this end. Look how varied 
is the task. First, the work must be planned. This must be done 
on a large scale, covering a whole county or several counties. Con- 
solidated schools must be located at proper points on the map 
before work can begin in the field. Then a campaign of educa- 
tion must be begun. The people must be brought to realize the 
great advantages to be derived from the new plan. Conflicting 
community interests must be reconciled, local boards appeased, 
taxes voted and appropriations united. Then a new organization 
is called for in the school itself; better teachers, more consistent 
grading; the school becomes an illustration of better architecture, 
of sanitation, of beautiful environment, until it becomes in actual 
fact the center of inspiration of a new community life.. This is our 
great rural problem—a problem large enough for us all, needing the 
services of every one; a problem that reaches into the very heart 
of our social and national life, calling for the statesman and the pa- 
triot, and for the unselfish service of both. There is no educational 
proposition today of greater importance that this, no work more 
far-reaching in influence and power. 
Another important task that many of our number are engaged 
in is the establishment of high schols in towns and villages and in 
rural districts as well. The rapidity with which this work has 
been done has surprised us all. The resources of the State and of 
local communities have been united. Colleges and universities 
have appointed special officers to assist in the work, and the Gen- 
eral Education Board has contributed to or borne the whole expense 
of their salaries. When a four-year course of study could not be 
maintained, three-year courses, or sometimes two-year courses, have 
   
-P-A-G-E-126

been organized, trusting to the future for the completion of an 
unfinished task. This is one of the greatest and most significant 
educational movements in the whole country. But it should have 
eareful direction and expert supervision. We must not be 
deceived by false names. We must not be the victims of low ideals. 
We must go over all our high schools again, bringing them to a 
proper standard in grounds, buildings and equipment, in courses 
of study, in teaching force, and in character of work done. Our 
high school progress for the next five years should be measured by 
intensive rather than extensive results. And it rests on educa- 
tional leaders, such as are gathered here, to bring about these 
results and save our rural communities from the mistakes of their 
own enthusiasm. 
But time would fail me were I to consider further in detail 
all parts of our educational work. My theme is “Patriotic Service 
Along Educational Lines.” My purpose is to show how the wel- 
fare, the existence of our republic is dependent on its educational 
workers, and to hold before our view some large present tasks to 
which we ought to give heed. ~I have said that education is the 
most important business the State is engaged in. And yet we 
must admit that this work has often been conducted in an unbusi- 
nesslike manner. We need educational reformation, and where 
can it more properly begin than in our Association? There are 
three great fields into which we may divide the State’s activity: the 
fleld of finance, of organization, and of administration. In every 
field new legislation is needed and expert educational leadership 
is in demand. In the field of finance we have been penurious and 
wasteful at the same time. We have not collected what should 
have been paid nor expended wisely the funds in hand. In organi- 
zation we have largely drifted. We have pursued a let-alone 
policy to our permanent hurt. Some States have two or more uni- 
versities without really having one. In some, high school work 
is done by high schools, public and private, but also by normal 
schools, by the A. and M. College, by private colleges, and even by 
the State University. There has been a strange lack of unity and 
correlation between all our educational forces. In the field of 
administration we have been equally neglectful. Adequate super- 
vision has regularly been lacking in all parts of our system. 
The time has fully come when we who claim to be educational 
leaders should direct our attention to the needs of the State in 
this our special field of labor. In State associations and in more 
general organizations such as this, these matters ought to be dis-
-P-A-G-E-127
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 127 
cussed. The needs of each State should be considered by educa- 
tional commissions, as has already been done in some quarters. 
The reports of such commissions should then be carefully studied 
and all the educational forces of the State united to secure their 
adoption. Self-interest should be sunk in the welfare of the larger 
whole. 
Our government needs the constant care of the individual citi- 
zen. Patriotism must be associated not with smoke and powder, 
but with quiet thought and sincere resolve; with unselfish service 
and intelligent constructive work. And we who teach patriotism 
in our classes should illustrate it in our lives. A Canadian boy 
employed in the Civil Service lay dying in one of the hospitals of 
South Africa. With a smile on his face he said to his friends 
around him, “It is glorious to die for the expansion of the empire.” 
If territorial expansion can fill a life, what shall we say of the 
teacher’s task, the expansion of the life, the emancipation of the 
human spirit, the uplift of our common human _ brotherhood? 
These are the rewards of the teacher’s toil, and they are at the 
same time the assurance of national greatness and the guarantee 
of national permanence and prosperity.

We thank you for your attendance this evening, and hope you

Dr. Andrew M. Soule, President of the State College of Agricul- 
ture, of Athens, Georgia, was to have talked to us tonight on the 
subject of “Education in Agriculture: A National Asset,” but 
unfortunately, he is absent. 
There being no other speaker on the program for this evening, we 
will adjourn. 
Adjourned until Saturday morning. 
SATURDAY MORNING. 
Called to order by Dr. Whitfield, Chairman. Small audience. 
Preswent WuHitTriELp: Ladies and Gentlemen—We are to have 
a discussion this morning on one of the fundamental institutions of 
society, and we are fortunate in having with us Dr. Charles Evans, 
President of the Central State Normal School of Edmond, Oklahoma, 
who will discuss the subject of the “School Permitting the State to 
be the Home-Maker.”’ Will Dr. Evans please come forward? 
Dr. Evans: Mr. Chairman and Teachers—We are here this morn- 
ing. Whatever others may say of us, we are here. (Laughter.) 
I have sometimes thought that we have perhaps reached the point in 
these deliberations where we shall feel as did the great Wendell 
Phillips, upon one occasion, when he found himself in front of a 
great audience and no crowd. Sometimes the crowd is with us, is 
attentive and in full sympathy with what we say, but sometimes the 
crowd is not sympathetic, and disagrees with the speaker to such an 
extent that they send him eggs of a peculiar odor. Well, this is 
about the situation in which Dr. Phillips found himself when he 
had a message to give to his audience, for they hooted and hissed so
-P-A-G-E-129
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 429 
that he could not be heard. He said nothing at all to that audience, 
but commenced whispering to a few fellows right in front of him. 
Soon the audience quieted down, and in a few minutes they were 
straining their ears to catch what he was saying. (Laughter.) 
Then he said: “I am not speaking to this small audience. I am 
speaking to the public press and through that to five million people 
in this country;” so that is the way I feel this morning. I refer 
only to the number of the audience, not to my reception. So this 
morning, we have a business in hand that is as wide as the nation, 
and if we find that we are making any progress, we ought to be sure 
to go on with our service, and feel that, after all, we have given the 
best we have to anyone who will reach out and get it. National 
educators recognize this truth that we are in a peculiar position in 
America. There is a point of gratification, a point of discomfiture, 
a point of upheaval. As I view it, we are in that position defined 
by Champ Clark, of Missouri, who, upon one occasion, in my pres- 
ence, spoke of the politics in Washington. They had been expound- 
ing an the tariff question, and some man came along and made a 
speech and said, so far as he knew, the tariff question was in a state 
of statu quo. The old fellows did not understand what that meant. 
They tried to find out what that meant, using all the measures they 
could. Eventually they came to half-witted Bill Smith. They 
asked him if he could tell them what was meant by the tariff being 
in a state of statu quo. He said: “TI have been thinking about that 
myself, and have been worrying over it; but from all I can gather, 
it is in a hell of a fix.” (Laughter.) It looks as if my friend 
Clark’s story might be applied here—the educational problem is in a 
state of statu quo. (Laughter.) We have been working at this 
problem for centuries. We have been doing the best we could to 
find out what would advance civilization through the medium of our 
public schools. We have been trying as best we could to serve the 
people, but we hear the rumbling of a coming storm. We find 
magazines and newspapers saying that instead of educating our 
boys and girls toward a bigger life, you have been training them 
away from it. Instead of educating them for the home, you are 
turning them against it. They are seeking life outside the home. 
They are leaving the place where men and women are best developed, 
and crowding pell-mell into the centers of vices, and you have not 
solved the problem of education. These criticisms may be true and 
they may be false, but, after all, we must hear them. 
I remember twelve years ago, during the meeting of the National 
Association, I was assigned the subject of the social problem. Just 
9

before I came there, I picked up a copy of The Ladies’ Home Journal, 
and right at the top of that magazine was this statement: “Century 
of crime at the feet of the American parent.” I read a few para- 
graphs, and I found myself a young fellow, giving the best of his 
life to what he thought was education. I found myself called a 
criminal by Edward W. Bok—a criminal because I was involved in 
the public schools, because he labelled that whole system as a crime 
on the American parent. In my fury to get at Bok, I was at a 
loss to know what means I should use to vanquish him. Finally I 
sent him a challenge: “There is no crime in the American school. 
It is woven about this republic.” Bok still persists in writing the 
story of twelve years ago. The Ladies’ Home Journal still insists 
that the American school is a failure. I sent that challenge, as I 
say, twelve years ago. I stand here today not so willing to fight 
with him. I feel more like going around and standing by his side. 
I have studied these educational problems and have observed the 
teachers as they come into the normal schools, and I feel that if 
Edward W. Bok is not correct, he is enough correct to make you and 
me wince, sit up, wonder, grope and strike at some of these troubles 
at which he is flinging such hot shots. How can we let the home 
teacher get out of the way and let the State be the home-maker? 
I was allowed to select my theme, and made it ‘““Home-Makers.” We 
can get along with fewer doctors, with fewer lawyers, with fewer 
artisans even—God bless them—who toil blindly often because the 
public school has not done its duty as it should; we can get along 
without even the farmer (I am talking about the kind of farmer we 
ought to have, because these doctors, lawyers, farmers, have been 
misnamed)—without all these; but we cannot do without the gen- 
uine home-maker. (Applause.) 
T came back to my native State to see my old comrades, whom I 
look upon as valiant workers—just to observe what Kentucky is 
doing in the business of home-making. I knew I would find it doing 
just what Oklahoma and the entire South is doing—groping blindly, 
seeking light. It seems to me that we are in the way. I said: “Put 
me down. Let the teachers get out of the way. Let the State be 
the home-maker.” What do I mean by this, fellow workers? I 
mean that we, in the past, have been doing the best we could in 
following the brilliant lights of education; but we have discovered 
somehow or other that the people, the plain people, the greatest 
teachers of the earth, have discovered at last our weakness, our mis- 
leading. They have discovered, in other words, that the schools they 
have builded have not given the aid they should have given in the
-P-A-G-E-131
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 181 
weaving of the vast fabric of learning and liberty in our country. 
In the development of this republic, its strongest element of life— 
they have discovered that the teachers did not do it. They dis- 
covered that, after all, education did not consist of books and book 
learning. They discovered that uniform courses of study (when I 
say uniform, I want to get at the lock-step system of building schools 
and grading them) did not contain the substance of life. It did 
not contain the real elements of strength upon which the country 
depends in making the home. We have considered reading, writing, 
and arithmetic the basic element of our civilization, and have not 
until recently made any attempt to prepare our pupils for any defi- 
nite life work. Another proof of this failure of the schools lies in 
the fact that so many men who are now prominent in the business 
world will say to a high school boy when he applies for a position: 
“What can you do?” And the boy has to admit that he is not 
qualified to fill any definite position. Then the business man will 
say to him: “Go to the business college and learn how to add, sub- 
tract, multiply and divide, and come back when you can do that, and 
we will give you something to do.” The high school girl, after 
graduation, discovers that the high tide of life has passed beyond 
her, and she is not what she thinks she is. The result has been 
disturbance, but today we are listening to the criticism of the busi- 
ness world and the commercial people are teaching us better lessons 
than we have found within our own circle. We found out a while 
ago from these plain business men that a careful study of life in the 
commercial world gives the broadest education, for, if I were to make 
a search, I should not pick the university man for the best educated 
men. I should pick from the business men—a man who had come 
from another school than one of these—a man who had run over and 
beyond the fountain and into life’s turbulent water. Life is the 
best school. This business man is giving us to understand that we 
are wanting something out of our schools that we are not getting. 
We are wanting men and women who can go into the home and make 
a true home—the farmer to get the best results out of his soil, the 
mechanic to send out from his shop the best work, and so on. 
The whole business is summed up in the thought of how we can 
adjust the training for life so as to get the most out of life. This 
is being summed up, and from these discussions we have been listen- 
ing to, we learn that the course of study is weak unless it leads into 
the great elements of manhood and womanhood, unless it fits for life. 
Some man has said, you may have a different way of classifying it. 
We think education and civilization have certain great attributes.    
-P-A-G-E-132
  132 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
We are discovering that the health problem is as big as any problem 
in geometry. We are working out domestic science in the health 
movement, in which is also included playgrounds and the question 
of sanitary living. We are establishing a school system wherein the 
young people will be taught that these things which pertain to the 
home are very important. For awhile these new lines of school 
work will be hard, but after awhile they will adjust themselves. 
We are seeking wealth. All men naturally seek wealth, but our 
courses do not produce the right kind of wealth. The boy gets the 
wrong education on a poor farm, so we need more school gardens to 
teach him the right way to farm. We need more libraries. Library 
courses are being established out in the country districts, and those 
people are being fed with healthy knowledge. 
We are discovering that we need not look for righteousness in bad 
environment, in unsanitary and unattractive houses. We must 
make the house into the home by making it pleasant and beautiful. 
If, by some means or other, in this country, we can get men to 
understand what we need in our schools, they would soon be efficient, 
harmonious and beautiful. 
We ought not to become indignant if this problem is not instantly 
understood rightly. We will never have true hearts until we sur- 
render that impulse to the right impulses. 
Putting music into the curriculum as a major study is an excellent 
thing. It will help to generate righteousness and will produce a 
better home-maker. If scciability is desired, we are trying as best 
we can through the leaders of this country to have the children in 
the public schools meet and understand each other. In Oklahoma 
this is being done. Here, my friends, are the great things of life. 
In conclusion, may I not say that this is the one difficulty we 
have. Here we are, the Southern Educational Association, meeting 
here to seek a better life, yet before you teachers go back to your 
work, I want to bring one thing before you, that you may understand 
how it is that we will move aside all of this rubbish of examinations 
and tests, all of these things that have gotten in the way of the 
teacher, and let us get back upon the level once more, get away from 
the foolish routine by which we have miseducated these American 
people, and give them the education they need. Get up a campaign 
in this State, with Barksdale Hamlett as your leader, and revise your 
educational system. Develop your vital, problems—home-making, 
vocational work, sociability, the routine of life, citizenship. Give 
the child the education it needs. It is up to us. If American 
children of all classes are not getting the right kind of education, we, 
as leaders, are responsible for it. (Applause.)

(President Whitfield criticised the audience for the rudeness of 
the people assembled in leaving the room during an address, 
saying: “Southern people are never so highly entertained as when 
making a speech, and never so bored as when someone else is speak- 
ing.”) 
Present Wuirrintp: We have with us this morning that old 
gentleman from Missouri, of whom it is said that the first citizens 
who came to the State found him there, for he was there then. 
(Laughter.) He is an ex-Normal School teacher, and has held many 
other positions. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Dr. John R. 
Kirk, President of the First District Normal School, Kirksville, Mo., 
who will address us on “Home-Making: One of the Ends of Edu- 
cation.” 
ScHoot Epucation ror Homy-MaKInG. 
JOHN R. KIRK, KIRKSVILLE, MO. 
All of school education is for the making of many-sided citizen- 
ship. As John Milton would say: “It is to prepare for all duties, 
both public and private, of peace and war.” But the great majority 
of people, both men and women, live more in their homes than they 
do anywhere else. Good citizenship in and around the home is of 
more consequence than it is anywhere else. It is fundamental 
citizenship. Therefore, educating young citizens for home making 
is one of the fundamental functions of school education. This prop- 
osition is so manifestly true and now so widely accepted as true 
that it would seem wasteful to argue its validity. So our chief 
concern is with the ways and means of carrying a recognized prin- 
ciple into effective operation. 
In many localities the children’s school grades are modified in 
view of the reports from home showing what the parents think of 
the performance of home duties by the children. In this way 
Manual Arts, Fine Art, Household Arts and Sciences, and all kindred 
school studies, are easily made contributory to the increase of home 
comforts. An alliance is readily made between these school exer- 
cises and home service. Interest, zeal, and appreciation of school 
studies are all more effective when through codperation of teacher 
and parent the wholesome school activities are made to function in 
home duties. This is the true laboratory method of teaching. 
There is no doubt that in many thousands of homes the parents 
never have any knowledge of the children’s school program, never 
show any interest in the children’s studies, and consequently never
-P-A-G-E-134

secure much sympathy from the children when it comes to the chores 
and other home duties. On the other hand, there are many good 
homes where the successful study of school History and Literature is 
greatly enhanced by the home association. Good reading habits and 
good conversation habits at home have a determining effect in the 
concentration of the children’s minds upon the Literature, the History 
and the other studies pursued in the school. Good reading habits 
_ and good conversation habits at home lay the foundations for the 
innumerable ethical influences and suggestions cropping out of the 
daily school lessons. Of course, the home ought to be a culture 
center as much as the school is; but ours is yet a relatively primitive 
civilization; and it is for school education to reach into the home 
and measureably to determine the trend of home thought, home 
reading, home conversation, and all home activities. 
It has been a vulgar and crude conception of education that has 
led us to keep harping over-much on the future attainment of prom- 
inence in public life, while the real and true comforts and satisfac- 
tions in living come more from the home life than from any possible 
public life. 
Here and there well-directed school life is withdrawing its energies 
somewhat from the militant conceptions of life and from the bellig- 
erencies of the dead past. There is something better for us. Recent 
examinations for entrance to several Eastern universities showed 
that some sixty per cent of the examination questions had to do with 
ancient life, and two-thirds of the questions on ancient life had to 
do with ancient warfare. Thus, forty per cent of all the questions 
for entrance into those universities were used to concentrate student 
mind on the wars of antiquity, but the universities are not so closely 
in touch with the humanizing forces in American life. The public 
schools feel the stimulus of our industrial and commercial civiliza- 
tion. The only danger to American civilization is self-destruction. 
No foreign nation can handle us, but it is also true that no indus- 
trial and commercial community ever destroyed itself. Since our 
trend is predominantly industrial and commercial, there is hope for 
us. It is for our schools to build upon the sentiment for industrial 
and commercial pursuits and give these forces a happier trend for 
centering the children’s attention more and more upon the means 
of comfort and refinement and of good living in and through the 
building of good homes. 
Do you ask for specific suggestions as to the curricula? That is 
easy. All through the grades and the high school we begin to have 
definite, brief, simple, easily demonstrated series of lessons in soils,

soil management, cereals, fruits, fruit-bearing trees, shrubs and vines, 
ornamental trees, shrubs, flowers and grasses, poultry raising, stock 
breeding, farm machinery, farm architecture, house architecture, 
road building, drainage, sanitation, manual arts, fine art, cooking, 
pattern making, sewing, tapestry, furniture judging, etc. Where is 
the limit? Really, there isn’t any. Even human ingenuity has 
no limit, and human hope is boundless. Do you ask for illustra- 
tions? My own great professional problem is to stimulate the 
impulses and increase the skill that must function in home-making. 
It is to produce a new grand army of large-visioned, hopeful, ambi- 
tious, ingenious, constructive, energetic, restless, altruistic school 
teachers. 
One day I heard the report of seventh grade children made before 
a group of thirty-five young school teachers. The children were 
from the practice school. Their lessons were in Sanitation and 
were given in the presence of the young prospective school teachers 
for illustrative purposes. The children reported in view of former 
assignments. One group had investigated the source of drinking 
water in their locality. The report was as follows: “We found the 
house-well twenty feet from the corner of the house. The stable for 
cows and horses was forty feet from the house. A line from the 
stable to the house formed a right angle with a line from the well 
to the house. The walk from the stable to the house was made of 
inch boards nailed on two-by-four supports. It formed a right angle 
with a similar walk from the house to the well. The rats had their 
paths from the stable to the house and from the house to the well. 
Rats burrowed down behind the wall of the well until they reached 
the level of the water in the well.” So the children went on with the 
report of the source of water for household uses. They discussed 
many details. They saw the origin of much sickness coming from 
the ignorance and recklessness of people in their neighborhood in 
the matter of water for house use. 
Another group of the same children had visited the restaurants 
and made observations as to the spread of disease through the tub of 
cold slop in which the restaurant keepers rinse the goblets. Many, 
many other illustrations could be given of the lessons these children 
were learning in sanitation. The children were reading widely, and 
thinking and observing more widely. Can anyone doubt the influ- 
ence of these lessons upon the present and future homes of the 
children ? 
I will give one more illustration. In a large and progressive 
normal school with perhaps three hundred male students and four
-P-A-G-E-136
  186 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
hundred young women students, there are many classes in Farm and 
Household Economics. In October a Rural Life Conference was 
held. Speakers came from many States. Faculty and students par- 
ticipated in the program. Exhibits were made by the Normal School, 
and by city, village and rural schools. There were exhibits of corn 
and bread and of fruit and farm animals. One afternoon no less 
than three thousand citizens from town, village and farm assembled 
on the campus to witness the stock show; but the faculty and the 
seven hundred prospective teachers were duly intermixed with the 
village and farm folks. It was a great demonstration of the inter- 
relation and inter-dependence of all the elements of a big and 
thriving community. ~ Hundreds of the young prospective teachers 
secured pointers for their future enterprises in their several com: 
munities. 
It'is not difficult, my friends, to direct our teaching energies into 
fruitful and productive channels. If we must dwell so much on the 
history and deeds of ancient peoples, it is easier to utilize the indus- 
trial, commercial, social and religious lives of the ancients than it is 
to teach of their wars and devastations, because there was so much 
in the general social activities of the ancients that appeals readily 
to the interests of young lives at the present time. But there is 
really more of things worth while in the activities of our own age 
than there is in all the uncertain antiquities. 
Some people are still harping’ upon education for culture and 
education of utility. They overlook the fact that those who once 
studied profoundly the classics, metaphysics, and abstract mathe- 
matics were making a vocation out of their studies, and the whole 
matter of culture was incidental. As for me, I cannot think of 
anything destined to lead more in the direction of refinement and 
culture than those beautiful studies in the manual arts, fine art, 
music, and the farm and household arts and sciences, which center 
all of them so beautifully in the ideals of home-making. 
Dr. Wurtrietp: We have with us this morning a teacher of these 
subjects who is known not only in her own city, but outside of it as 
well. I refer to Miss Iva Scott, who will discuss “The Home in Its 
Making on the Farm.” Will Miss Scott please come forward? 
Tur Home in Its MakING ON THE Farm. 
MISS IVA SCOTT. 
A famous American woman once said, “The mission of the ideal 
woman is to make the whole world homelike.’ If you please,
-P-A-G-E-137
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 137 
allow me to modify that expression and say, “The mission of the 
ideal woman is to make her own habitation homelike.” Her place 
of abode may be the tent of the Arab, the igloo of the Eskimo, the 
log cabin of the pioneer, or the mansion of the Southland, yet regard- 
less of the geographical location, there is within the heart of every 
woman the spirit of home and home-making. 
There are a number of factors which influence the making of 
home; foremost of these are the climate, the altitude, the topogra- 
phy of any country, the proximity of neighbors, and the moral and 
mental development of the home makers. The home life in New 
England differed from that in the southern colonies; the home life 
in the country always has been and always will be different from that 
in the city. In New England, farming was conducted on a small 
scale. The fisheries and forests were ever a source of great wealth; 
as a result, New England grew into an industrial center. The early 
Puritans were a stern people and averse to social pleasures, yet the 
house-raisings, the husking-bees, the quiltings and tea parties gave 
them an opportunity to develop social instincts. The women neces- 
sarily spun the thread, wove the cloth and made the garments by 
hand; they even cooked the meals before the great open fireplaces. 
Conditions were somewhat different in the South. The warm 
climate tended to produce an easy-going manner; the large planta- 
tions lessened social intercourse; with slaves to spin, to weave, to 
cook and to clean, the woman had little to do except live in luxury. 
However, each home has had its place in society to fill and eack 
has filled it well. 
During the colonial and revolutionary periods, the girl received 
more specific training for the making of a home than she does, gen- 
erally, today. At that time there was little she could do except 
to remain at home to learn and to practice household occupations; 
even her opportunities for an education were limited. Then came 
a time when the position of woman in the world changed; the 
change came gradually at first, then with great rapidity, due partly 
to the increased educational opportunities, and also to the changed 
economic and social conditions, until today she may enter any 
field for which she is physically able, on ah equality with man. 
These same conditions have changed woman’s place in the home, 
and her attitude toward home affairs. The love of home is no 
longer the ruling passion of her life, but home oftentimes is merely 
a place to eat, to sleep and to perform unpleasant tasks. 
Is it any wonder that the girl of today, with her lack of interest 
in the home and home life, grieves our grandmothers who are fa-  
-P-A-G-E-138
  188 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
miliar with every constructive process in the making of a home? 
To our grandparents the establishment of a home meant the begin- 
ning of life, the making of a home, meant their very existence. 
Today we speak with pride of the dainty sewing, the delicious cook- 
ing for which our own grandmother was noted in her day. ‘To take 
from her hands her thimble, to cast aside the old chest of drawers 
so dear to her heart, to place before her bouillon and lobster salad 
at dinner, is but to rob her of life’s greatest charms. There is no 
picture so dear, no memory so sweet as “Over the river and through 
the woods to Grandfather’s house we go.” Only those of us who 
were reared in the country can experience the thrills of delight 
which such a picture produces. May we as men and women of 
today stand with uncovered and bowed heads while paying homage 
to that rural home from which came men and women of sterling 
character, trained by parents who felt and lived in “God’s out-of- 
doors.” 
We rightly regard our grandmothers as remarkable women, and 
considering the material and equipment with which they had to 
work, marvelous results were accomplished by them. In many 
instances the entire processes of life, the cooking, the eating, the 
sleeping, the sewing, the entertaining of guests, the training of chil- 
dren for citizenship, were all carried on in one room; but the great 
changes of economic conditions have placed us on a different plane 
from that of our forefathers. They were forced to do the spinning, 
the weaving, the making of the clothes, and the baking of the 
bread; the burden of our work has been minimized by the estab- 
lishment of great cotton and woolen mills, bakeries and laundries. 
In other words, great systems have been evolved which are capable 
of performing many household duties away from the home. 
One secret of success of the great manufacturing industries today 
is system. Women are at last beginning to appreciate the value of 
system in household labor. Heretofore no thought has been given 
to the planning of meals, except to feed the hungry children, to 
satisfy the tired husband, or to please company; the kitchen pro- 
cesses have not been coérdinated ; the housekeeper has walked miles 
in her workshop each day, and it is with regret that one must admit 
this type of housekeeper has not passed entirely away. In a few 
years haphazard planning will be discarded, and each member of 
the family will recognize the rights of others. If our rural women 
will only consider carefully the results of system in performing the 
daily tasks, one great step for the betterment of the home will have 
been taken. System brings order, restfulness, happiness and it con-

serves energy. Everywhere we hear discussed the conservation of 
our natural resources; surely, the conservation of physical energy 
means more to the human race for perpetuation than the conserva- 
tion of our forest, our coal fields and our national parks. 
There are several reasons why the farm home has not developed 
as rapidly as our agricultural interests. The farmer’s wife is the 
most important and essential person on the farm, consequently she 
needs the greatest care and consideration. But the farmer gives 
close attention to the care and feeding of his live stock, yet his wife 
works from morning until night with, possibly, never a thought 
from her husband regarding her food and her rest. Never before 
have the farmers been so abundantly paid for the enormous yield of 
their crops, and yet a large per cent of these farmers will use the 
profit to buy more land, to raise more corn, more wheat, more to- 
bacco, to feed more stock, to buy more land, ete., until they become 
burdened with land, and have not the money, the implements and 
the laborers to continue the cycle. The farm demonstration work 
of the United States Government is teaching the farmer how to make 
the soil on his farm yield more abundantly without buying more 
land to increase the amount of his crops; then let him take even 
a part of the profit to provide for the mother and children such con- 
veniences as will lighten the burden of drudgery and make it a 
labor of love. By so doing the mother will have the time and strength 
to serve her community by participating in its vital affairs. 
The relief to women of rural communities must come through a 
general elevation of country living. Why are the boys and girls 
constantly leaving the farm? The two main reasons which enter 
into this are educational and economical. An enthusiastic teacher 
inspires his pupils with a desire for a higher education ; in Kentucky 
the boys and girls are being urged to attend the county high school, 
and this thirst for knowledge leads them to the college, the normal 
school and the university. With such a preparation it is then com- 
paratively easy to enter the battle of life, and in one month possess 
more money than many a farmer possesses at one time after twelve 
months of hard manual labor. What inducement is there now to 
return to the farm? It is true that we need college trained men 
and women in the rural community in order to elevate the standards 
of living. But the problem still remains to be solved—not only 
how to bring back competent men and women to the farm, but also 
how to retain those already there. 
The social life of the rural community and the city present a 
striking contrast. In the ordinary rural community there are not
-P-A-G-E-140
  140 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
enough social experiences for the boys and girls; hence there is a 
certain amount of crudeness, awkwardness and lack of refinement 
which lingers permanently in the character; on the other hand the 
city ripens the young life too rapidly; this produces the manners 
and refinements of adult life before the child has matured mentally. 
One of the greatest needs of every rural community is a social leader. 
If the parents were qualified, they should stand at the head of all 
social activity. However, the parents are not always able to take 
the social helm, then it becomes the duty of the teacher to do so. 
In many places, in our own and other States, the teacher has been 
able to bring parents and children together for the purpose of dis- 
cussing the needs of the community. A teacher that has the power 
of leadership and a strong personality can do much toward increas: 
ing the proper kind of social functions, and at the same time build 
up a strong sentiment for rural life. 
If it becomes the duty of the teacher to be the social leader, then 
will it be necessary for the school officials to change the course of 
study in order to face the situation. While we agree that there are 
certain fundamental principles of the subjects taught which must 
be fixed in the mind of each child, yet the application of these prin- 
ciples should come within the experience of farm boys and girls. 
To illustrate, the results of the boys’ corn clubs throughout the 
South have increased the standard for the production of corn and 
have awakened many farmers to the fact that their farnis have 
yielded in proportion to what was put into them. 
Someone has said that there should be a fourth R in education 
and that it should mean right living. The household duties always 
have becn and always will be woman’s work; if that be true, why 
not educate our girls in the profession of home making? Many girls 
never reach the high school, much less the college, but even in the 
elementary schools we can place before them high ideals of home and 
show the results of right living. The Domestic Science Clubs, which 
are so rapidly becoming a feature of the rural schools, will, in a 
few years, carry new ideas into every rural home; a new interest 
will be created, new standards of living formed; as a final result 
our homes will become one of the greatest assets of the American 
republic. 
One of the newest movements connecting the home and the school 
is that of giving school credit for work done on the farm and in 
the home which is genuinely beneficial to the boys and girls. This 
not only arouses interest for home activities but also acquaints the 
parents with school work. The school gardens mean infinitely more
-P-A-G-E-141
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 141 
than a knowledge of the preparation of the soil and of raising crops. 
In many cases they help to supply the winter food; they furnish 
an opportunity to teach the child the beauties of nature; they 
develop the artistic side of his life. 
But before we can ever bring these things to pass universally 
there must be a new outlook developed among agriculturists, and 
one phase of this outlook is the manner of living. A new point of 
view of life, its meaning, its possibilities of enjoyment and satisfac- 
tion must come to every farmer. Life to the average farmer is 
devoid of the larger and more attractive elements; his life is a round 
of eating, working, sleeping, economizing, recognizing only the bare 
necessities, skimping along with inconveniences, especially in the 
home. The farmers need to have developed the sentiment that the 
fullest and most successful life is the one which obtains the greatest 
number of satisfied wants in passing. Under this transformation 
the country will build good homes, comfortable in the modern sense, 
having the conveniences which lighten the burdens of the indoor 
workers, and the equipment which renders the place sanitary and 
healthful. 
The reorganization of rural education is a necessary step toward 
the realization of a changed viewpoint and a larger rural life. The 
country school is one of the few things that has remained almost 
unchanged the past twenty-five years. To meet the demands of the 
situation some important changes must be made in the courses of 
study. The time is not far distant when the home, the school and 
the farm will be closely related through the courses of work and 
the practical applications at home. It will create new interests, 
higher ideals, and a thirst for applied scientific knowledge which 
will increase our standards of living and the morality in every rural 
community. 
But this is a day of transition. The farmer and his wife may 
not be able to build an ideal house; they may not be able to recon- 
struct the family so as to secure the codperation that makes the 
perfect home. However, a new day is dawning. Into the home will 
come that great freedom of thought that lifts men and women above 
the limitations of distance, time and space. That means the coming 
of peace to anxious and overburdened souls. It means hope, pros- 
perity, financial gain and greater educational advantages to rural 
people. It means the emancipation for all woman kind.

‘ H. H. CHERRY. 
Man is the fundamental unit of human growth. Noble life 
sheds noble life, visions transmute visions, and ideals create ideals. 
We teach and influence the world by living within, by making our 
life one of noble deeds. Living a life is nature’s laboratory for 
the training of citizens. A great influence is largely inward, 
not outward; real, not mechanical; personal, not legislative. The 
man who is crowned with freedom by noble self-endeavor, silently 
but surely influences the world to noble deeds and actions. The 
saved will save, and life will teach without individual convention- 
ality. The world would have experienced a new birth, a moral, 
intellectual and spiritual regeneration long ago, if all the people, all 
the little puny surface reformers, who have been trying to save the 
world, had been saved themselves. Great teaching begins in the 
house occupied by our own soul. We should stop losing so much 
time and wasting so much money in trying to set in order our 
neighbor’s household and spend more time at the anvil of our indi- 
vidual and professional lives, hammering and forging a life that 
will have human beauty, attractiveness and influence.
-P-A-G-E-143

I have no objection to a conscious attention to our influence on 
others, to a deliberate effort to reform, unless it takes of the nature 
of posing for example or a self-conscious influence. Constructive 
childhood never respects a “sissy,” a moral model, or a mentor, 
but it will unconsciously crawl into the lap and put its arms 
around a great warm aggressive personality who loves and serves, 
and whose life draws and not drives. 
“Go make thy garden fair, 
Thou workest not alone. 
For he whose plot is next to thine 
Will note and mend his own.” 
Go give the world one great life, full of noble service and high 
ideals, and your neighbor will note your effort and mend his own. 
I purchased three acres of land located on the bank of beautiful 
Barren River, within three miles of Bowling Green. It was a rough 
and unsightly spot. The underbrush was cleared away, the briar 
thickets cut, and the sink holes filled. Trees and projecting sur- 
face stones were left and bluegrass planted. It became at once an 
attractive place for a summer home. An inexpensive, modest little 
bungalow was built on the bluff overlooking the river and was 
painted red. The posts used for fencing the place were sharpened 
at the top and painted red. One morning I was down in the coun- 
try on the public highway that passed by the side of the bungalow 
and was greeted by a gentleman, who remarked during our con- 
versation that, if I did not object, he was going to paint his bunga- 
low red like mine. A little later, while passing through the valley 
near Bowling Green, I came across a gentleman who was building 
a fence around his home. He did not know me, nor did I know him. 
He said: “There is a fellow down here on the bank of Barren River 
who sharpened his posts at the top and painted them red, and I am 
going to sharpen my posts at the top and paint them red.” If you 
want your neighbor to paint his bungalow red, paint your bungalow 
red; if you want him to sharpen his posts at the top and paint them 
red, sharpen your posts at the top and paint them red; if you want 
him to plant a tree, a vine, plant a tree or a vine yourself; if you 
want him to be a model farmer, be a model farmer and have a model 
farm; if you would give your neighbor a vision, an ideal, a purpose, 
a life, you must have a vision, an ideal, a purpose, and live a life; 
finally, if you would make your pupils moral, then vitalize your 
literature, your history, and every other subject and item of your 
school with a moral, human personality. Man who possesses

moral and intellectual initiative is himself the one great method 
for the development of spiritual unity and human growth. I am 
not here to present a plan to be used as a machine in which to grind 
out citizens, but I desire to emphasize that influence is largely 
inherent in personality, and that the integrity of individuality 
must be preserved in the life of the child, or else we shall experi- 
ence a gloomy failure in the work of: making citizens for service in 
a democracy. 
The thought and conduct of the child of tomorrow depends upon 
the child of today. If we would make the boys and girls of tomor- 
row great citizens, capable of responsibility, we must make them 
great boys and girls today, and cease to talk so much about training 
them for future citizenship. We must start out with the idea that 
the child is a citizen now, capable of responsibility, and that it is 
just as impossible to make a great boy without putting responsibility 
upon his young life as it would be for one to be a great man with- 
out recognizing his obligations to society. It has been intensely 
interesting to watch the boy of the Corn Club go behind his one 
acre of corn and assume the responsibility of preparing the soil, 
selecting the seed corn, cultivating and, at the same time, chal- 
lenging the world to a contest for the largest yield. This responsi- 
bility makes him a leader, creates the power of initiative, and 
makes him an important citizen in the life of the community. 
He is so busily engaged that he forgets to be an idler or even a bad 
boy. The boy that does a noble day’s work, one that is vitatized 
with responsibility and service, is not in much danger. 
We must teach the child so that 
“If it should come to a river deep and wide 
And there was no canoe to skim it, 
And its duty was on the other side, 
That it would jump in and swim it.” 
The child will not swim the river of tomorrow unless it swims 
the river of today. It will not live tomorrow unless it lives today. 
It is not likely to be moral tomorrow unless it is moral today. 
Moral training is related to every item of life. It enters into and 
is an organic part of every thought and act of the human being. 
If the school succeeds in accomplishing moral results, it will be 
through a complete vitalization of every item of the school. 
I know a school that has accomplished remarkable results in the 
training of citizens, and it has not a single distinct and exclusive 
piece of work that it does in the interest of moral training. The
-P-A-G-E-145
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 145 
school itself is a great moral lesson, and every member of the 
faculty and every student is a teacher and a learner. The school’s 
Board of Control is moral; its faculty is moral; its vision is moral; 
its ideal is moral; its purpose is moral; its class-room lesson is 
moral; its atmosphere is moral; and the student is, without mechan- 
ical effort, moral. This school is not a moral poser; it is not even 
consciously moral; it has never had a moral spasm; but it is a 
living, growing organism that has a vision that sees the right, and 
a nerve that fights the wrong. 
No school that is not itself aglow with enthusiasm for refine- 
ment, beauty, sincerity, truth, righteousness, can kindle in those 
under its charge this flame of the higher patriotism. Formal 
efforts in the interest of ethical life and conventional lessons count 
for little for human beauty unless the school itself vitalizes its 
efforts with human interest and honor and lives a noble life. I 
cannot think of anything that is more pathetic than for a school 
executive to preach the gospel of high ideals and good citizenship 
to the world, when his own Board is at war over some petty school 
item; when the members of the faculty are jealous of each other’s 
success and salary rather than have pleasure in each other’s achieve- 
ments; when the student-body is divided into factions, fraternities 
and academic aristocracies, each declaring dividends for vandal- 
ism, hazing, and for exclusiveness rather than for the rule of sym- 
pathy, interest and fellowship. The school itself must be a democ- 
racy before it can succeed in training citizens for life in a democ- 
racy. 
Moral training in the school is best accomplished through the 
ethical nature of man, constructive chapel exercises and recitations, 
debating societies, school games, spiritual unity, spontaneous moral 
enthusiasm, student and faculty loyalty to lofty ideals. It is 
accomplished through a school atmosphere that becomes a spiritual 
overflow, a spiritual magnet that draws and a contagion of person- 
ality that pushes and controls the student and makes him strong 
in mind, strong in heart, noble in conduct, and responsible for the 
ideals of his school, and for the ideals of his country. 
The rule of the school that is going to make great citizens is 
not a printed placard on the walls of the school building telling 
the pupil what he must do and not do, but it is a desire and a pur- 
pose in the life of the student that makes him do what a lady or a 
gentleman would do. It is not a sign-board posted on the school 
grounds notifying the student to keep off the grass, but it is a patri- 
otism that makes him take an interest in civic beauty and in making 
10 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  146 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the school grounds, the public parks, and the yards of the homes, 
beautiful and attractive. It is not a wire stretched along the walk 
in order to keep the pupil off the grass, but it is a thoughtfulness, 
a spiritual wire stretched in human life that enables the student to 
stay in the road without conventional deliberation. The rule of the 
* school that is going to make great citizens is not nails driven 
through a plank and put in the windows to keep the boys from 
sitting in them, but mental nails driven in the mind. It is not a 
blue button standing for school loyalty worn on the lapel of the 
coat, but a duty worn in the soul. It is not a switch to be used 
upon the pupil, but a moral spontaneity that exits in the life of the 
school that severely chastises the wrong and applauds the right. 
It is not some private student detective working secretly in the 
school to overtake the wrong, but a school sentiment that is vital- 
ized with honor. It is not a gold medal offered for intellectual 
achievements, and for the best orations, but a burning desire to 
have more life and to render more service in this interesting world. 
It is not the approach to a dead school day filled with mechanical 
duties, but an eagerness to rise early in the morning and to expe- 
rience duty’s thrill and the joy and peace that come from having 
done an honest day’s work. 
Learn to live by living should characterize the life of every school 
in this land. Actual life in the home, on the way to and from 
school, at school, on the play ground, actual life in the recitation, 
in the game of marbles, on the baseball field, and in every other 
item and in every act and thought of the school, must be largely 
unconsciously practiced if we would make noble citizens out of the 
boys and girls. 
A little girl nine years of age came to our home to visit our little 
daughter, Josephine. Our little daughter, who was attending 
school, prepared a lunch to take with her and put it on the mantel- 
piece. While our little visitor was alone in the room, she ate the 
lunch, and when asked why she did it, she said: “Josephine, you 
did not put it where I could not get it.” I fear that much of our 
effort to reform accomplishes this result. 
I believe artificial school rules made by blind school executives 
have a tendency to make violators of the law and to fill our peniten- 
tiaries with criminals. I believe the ethical child experiences a 
thrill whenever it cheats the schoolmaster’s dogma and artificial 
code of school regulations; and I fear that every time it has this 
experience, it has less respect for the dignity of the law and for con- 
stituted authority. School rules and laws that are not founded
-P-A-G-E-147
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS., 147 
upon justice and the ethical nature of man have, in my opinon, 
done much harm in the work of training citizens for service in a 
democracy. We cannot force human growth through a teacher’s 
dogma, a school machine, or a legislature; neither can we have 
great men and make all of them in the same mould. Behind all 
this thing we call the school lies personality, the leadership of an 
authorized executive; and behind the personality of this human 
executive should stand, and must stand, a divine personality, the 
personality of.God. 
I know a great citizen whose early outlook on life was gloomy. 
He had native ability, but was without purpose and ambiton. He 
entered a school that was taught by a great teacher, who had given 
himself a rich preparation for his chosen work, and who was great 
in purpose, sympathy and service. The light of the teacher soon 
lighted up the life of the boy, and this youngster decided to be and 
do something in life. He said: “I am going to be an oculist. 
I am going to try to be the best oculist in this country.” An over- 
mastering purpose possessed him and became a faith, a fire in the 
home of his soul. His teacher unconsciously led him to see that 
his success in the treatment of the eye depended largely upon his 
own ability to see, not only with the physical eye, but with the 
eye of the spirit. He completed a preparatory course of study and 
entered the University and graduated. Everything he did and 
everything he studied seemed to be related in some way or some- 
how to an effort to make the blind see. His purpose was a patriot- 
ism and not a commercialism, a service and not a fee, a life and not 
a vocation. He entered a special course arranged for the study 
of the eye and graduated with honors; he located in a small city 
and announced that he was ready to treat the eye, but few patrons 
came and he was discouraged, but he had faith and patience. 
There had lived in the little town for twenty-five years a character 
known as the “blind tramp.” He went to the office of the oculist 
one day and asked for eyes that would enable him to see. He had 
knocked at the door of other oculists only to be turned back into 
the dark world. The young oculist, fired by a desire to help the 
blind to see, made a trial of his faith. The light of his life lighted up 
the eyes of the “blind tramp,” and he was able to see. People 
heard about the remarkable cure and came from all directions 
seeking light. 
In the preparation of this little story, I have made an attempt to 
emphasize that the teacher is the oculist and the soul is the eye; 
the school is the oculist and the community is the eye; and the
-P-A-G-E-148

light of the eye and of the community depends upon the light of 
the oculist. I am trying to say that influence, whether personal or 
institutional, is largely inherent in personality. The best thing 
in human endeavor is a human being. The best thing in the school 
is the conquering personality of the teacher. Without engineers 
our attempt to build the Panama Canal would have failed; without 
teachers we will never accomplish our educational ideals. I some- 
times fear that we are trying to dig a Panama Canal without a 
Goethals; trying to establish wireless telegraphy without a Mar- 
coni; trying to win a vitory at Valley Forge without a Washington ; 
trying to write a Declaration of Independence without a Jefferson ; 
trying to write a drama without a Shakespeare; trying to teach 
without a teacher; trying to accomplish light without light, and 
life without life. 
Dr. Wuitrietp: I take pleasure in presenting Miss Orcutt.” 
Miss Hortensr M. Orcurr: A few weeks ago I was invited to 
be a spectator at a children’s party. The small hostess was cele- 
brating her fourth birthday and her guests ranged in age from two 
and a half to four. There were twenty children, and it was a 
charming party to behold in the way of lovely children and dainty 
dresses; and there was one supreme moment of quiet bliss when 
each child lifted his spoon for the first mouthful of ice cream. For 
the rest of the time only one child cried, and that but for a moment, 
so the party was voted a great social success. To be sure, in spite 
of the earnest efforts of four grown-ups and a little girl of ten, no 
games had come to a successful issue and no child had displayed 
any interest in any other child, save to demand something that he 
had or to tumble and roll in a general mix-up of children, that 
began when small Dan, in imitation of a ball, rolled his fat self 
madly across the floor, upsetting several children who happened to 
be in his path. * 
When the party was over, each child was brought, often pro- 
testingly, by his nurse to say good-bye to a perfectly indifferent 
hostess and her gracious and smiling mamma. Supreme individual- 
ism, aggressive self-assertion reigned from the beginning of the 
party to the end thereof. And this is the normal social attitude 
of a little child under four. He has little or no ability to live in 
harmony with his peers, and yet four is the age at which a little 
child enters kindergarten, and in a few weeks, sometimes in a few 
days, we find him living in harmonious relation with forty or fifty 
of his peers for three hours at a stretch.
-P-A-G-E-149
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 149 
The secret of this apparent phenomenon is that at four years 
of age the child is at the dawning of his social interests. The 
kindergarten takes advantage of his awakening interest and intro- 
duces him into a world of ordered activities and relationships 
based upon the fundamental human needs. Deep in every human 
heart is the longing to be at one with his fellows, to find a common 
bond. In the belief then that the things that unite men are more 
fundamental and important than the things that divide them, the 
kindergarten proceeds to interpret the underlying unities; to find 
the unity in manifoldness and the manifoldness in the unity, would 
be Froebel’s phrasing. : 
The kindergarten day starts with a moving circle, symbol of 
unbroken unity in a coming together of many children from many 
homes into a community or school home. Tach child brings his 
contributions, his treasure of experiences to enrich the life of the 
kindergarten; and out of these many experiences the kindergarten 
selects certain experiences common to all the children and inter- 
prets their meaning. In this way each individual child’s life takes 
on a larger meaning and a common bond is established among the 
children which gives an organic unity to the kindergarten. 
Throughout the kindergarten day this double training goes on. 
The child is encouraged to self-activity, to a directed tangible 
expression of his interests and ideas; especially is this true in the 
occupations and gifts, but these activities which are so individual, 
are a part of a program which is based upon interests that all the 
children have in common and are directed toward ends for the 
common good and happiness of the kindergarten as a whole. 
The whole plan of the kindergarten year is also based upon this 
principle of unity in manifoldness, this interdependence of human 
beings—in the family, in the community, in the state, in the nation, 
in the world. Over and over again the lesson comes, not through 
precept but through experience: “If you would be happy, you must 
work for the best interests and happiness of the whole,” and con- 
versely: “The whole is safe and happy only as the interests and 
happiness of the individual are protected.” Did time permit, one 
could go through the entire year’s program focusing as it does in 
the great festivals that have voiced the common needs and aspira- 
tions of civilized man for many centuries, and show how this prin- 
ciple of the largest individual freedom consistent with the best 
common good and happiness, underlies all the training of the kin- 
dergarten. And is this not training for citizenship in the finest 
and best sense?

Whatever fester spots are in our fair republic, are they not 
caused either by the selfish greed of individuals on the one hand, 
or the curtailment of legitimate personal liberty and interest on 
the other? 
The preamble to the Constitution of our United States outlines 
the ideals underlying our democracy with clearness and power: 
“We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more per- 
fect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide 
for common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the 
Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and 
establish this Constitution of the United States of America.” 
These are high purposes, only to be successfully and perpetually 
fulfilled by the education of each generation. The kindergarten 
nurtures the child in these ideals, gives him a chance through his 
own self-activity to put the ideals into conduct in his immediate 
personal world, and it opens a vision of a larger world that shall 
call for the same service in spirit, but will ever widen demands, 
obligations and priviliges to meet the growing powers of his matur- 
ing nature, his increased capacity for self-expression and for serv- 
ice. (Applause.) :

RESOLUTIONS. 
I. Be it resolved by the Southern Educational Association, now assembled 
in the city of Louisville, Ky., That it hereby extends its sincere thanks to the 
people of this city for their hospitality to its members and the deep interest 
manifested by them in the cause which it represents; to the local committee 
for the excellent arrangements made for its convenience and comfort; to the 
officers of the Warren Memorial Church for the use of this beautiful and 
commodious building; to the press of Louisville for its full and comprehensive 
reports of its meetings; to the school authorities for their interest; to the 
Louisville Publicity Committee for its substantial support; and to the officers 
and all others who have, in any way, contributed to the success of the meeting. 
II. That this Association reaffirms the great principles and policies for 
which it has so long stood, to wit: The advancement of all phases of educa- 
tion, particularly in the States composing this Association, by reason of the 
educational problems unique to this section. The solution of these can only 
be accomplished by those most closely in touch with them and to whom they 
are most vital: A 
(a) The right kind of education for the Southern negro, so that he may 
not be a menace to society, and through that education be trained into law- 
abiding, patriotic, productive citizenship. 
(b) The better education of the farmer’s child by so relating his schools 
to his environment that he will not only be content to remain on the farm, but 
that the products of the soil may be so increased through scientific methods 
that it may bring all the comforts and culture desireble to the rural homes of 
the South;  
-P-A-G-E-152
    152 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
(ce) The elimination of the useless and impractical from the courses of 
study in the schools, and the relation of every phase of school life to the life 
of the community ; 
(d) The education of our girls in practical studies as suggested by the 
foregoing, but also giving them broad culture, and, above all, preserving that 
charming spiritual and physical personality so marked in Southern women; 
(e) We urge the emancipation of the factory child through education and 
the promotion of good citizenship through home and school training; 
(f) The payment of equal salaries to men and women of the profession 
for equal service. 
Ill. Be it further resolved, That this Association does hereby express its 
satisfaction over the fact that a great teacher has been promoted to the high- 
est office within the gift of the American people, and point with pride to the 
reward of patient, faithful and efficient service crowned by his selection to 
this great public trust ; 
IV. Be it further resolved, That since teachers are the poorest paid of all 
public servants, in comparison with the services rendered, this Association 
earnestly pledges itself to agitate the question of better salaries in every 
honorable way, so that teachers may not have their professional ability and 
enthusiasm chilled by penury, and that they may be able to continually 
progress toward greater proficiency. 
V. That we express our satisfaction and pride in the great work done by 
the National Department of Education under the leadership of United States 
Commissioner Claxton and urge Congress to increase its usefulness and service 
by larger appropriations. 
VI. Resolved, That we urge increased support of normal schools, teachers’ 
colleges and schools of education, to the end that all children may have the 
benefit of teachers of the highest possible academic and professional efficiency. 
VII. Wuereras, The estimate based upon the examinations of thousands 
of children in all parts of the world indicate that from one-fourth to one-third 
of all children have defective eyesight; therefore, 
Be it resolved by the Southern Educational Association— 
1. That it urge school trustees to provide competent medical inspection at 
Jeast for the communicable eye diseases ; and; 
2. That it urge the teachers of these schools which are unable to secure 
medical inspection to do voluntarily what the teachers of some States must 
do by law—that is: 
(a) By using the Snolson vision charts designed for teachers and to make 
at least once a year tests of eyesight; and 
(b) To send to the parents of such children as shall have been found to 
have defective vision requests that those children be taken to oculists for 
accurate examinations. : 
That, following the policy of the National Educational Association, the 
Southern Educational Association shall have a standing committee on Con- 
servation of Vision. Respectfully submitted,

Motion to adopt the resolutions as read carried unanimously. 
Dr. Wuirrintp: More money is spent on patent medicine than 
is spent upon public education, and our general efficiency as a 
nation is much lower than it should be, because we are not trained 
in the right habits of life. 
We have with us this morning Dr. A. T. McCormack, Secretary 
of the State Board of Health, Bowling Green, Ky., who will give us 
a lecture accompanied by stereopticon views on “Health and Educa- 
tional Problems.” I knew his father, have been up against him, 
and know the worth of his steel, so I am sure we shall hear a splen- 
did talk on this subject. (Laughter and applause.) 
Ds. McCormack: Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen—It is 
with considerable temerity that I appear before this body—one of 
the greatest living forces in the United States. When I listen to 
these great leaders on public problems, I feel that it is hard for me 
to contribute my mite, when called upon by these leaders. 
I want to submit to you one proposition: if I can give you one 
thought to carry back to those you lead, I shall feel amply repaid 
for my work. Health is an educational problem pure and simple. 
We know that transmissible diseases are conveyed by a dozen 
agents; that a man is not a criminal who takes strychnine or mor- 
phine or any other kind of poison, if you carelessly place it where 
he, without his knowledge, gets it; but the man is a criminal who 
places the poison where his fellow gets it without his knowledge. 
Our records show that forty-seven out of every hundred deaths are 
from preventable diseases, and we propose to prevent them. Ken- 
tucky has furnished the public officials for half of the Western 
States, and now that Democracy has come into her own in the 
nation, we propose to save enough of our young men, who have 
been needlessly dying, to furnish the greater proportion of them 
hereafter. We need more people and we propose to have healthy 
people. I want to submit this one proposition: diseases are caused 
by distinct poisons. If you permit a pupil who has gone through 
your school to put poison from his body where his neighbor gets it, 
then he is just as guilty of murder as if he scattered strychnine 
around. The doctors know it. The doctors have been striving to 
overcome this, and they have not been paid for it. The average 
income for the doctor in the South is less than $700.00 a year. We 
have not had time to teach the people, because we have had to work 
twenty-four hours each day to make a bare living. We have just 
waked up and we are glad to have an opportunity of coming before
-P-A-G-E-154
  
  154 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
an audience such as this to bring before you these important lessons 
in the preservation of health. 
First Pictwre——You see here the picture of a fourteen-year-old 
child from Alabama. Notice the expression of his face; or, rather, 
note the absolute lack of intelligent expression. What is the use of 
trying to teach him anything so long as he is in such a poor physical 
condition? His trouble is a growth of adnoids in his nose. By a 
skillful physician these growths could be easily removed, then he 
would be ready fer mental training, if this were his only physical 
defect ; but unfortunately for him, in addition to this, he was afilicted 
with hookworm, roundworm and tapeworm. The hookworm disease 
is prevalent in the South, and you should find out whether or not 
you are infected with them. If you have not done so, you have not 
done your duty. 
Second Picture.—These two boys are brothers. Both have lived 
in the same house, have eaten at the same table and have lived the 
same kind of a life generally. The little one, who is the elder, is 
infected with the hookworm; the larger one is not. (One boy was 
dwarfed in stature, the other was well developed.) 
Third Pictuwre.—The little girl in this picture is six years old; 
the big one is only five. They are both doctors’ daughters, out in 
the mountains. The smaller girl has the hookworm disease, which 
has prevented her symmetrical development. The larger child is in 
school; the smaller is not. 
Fourth Pictwre—This is a family out in the mountains. (A 
most wretched-looking group of people standing before a tumble- 
down cabin.) The father, mother and all four children have hook- 
worm disease. All of them have pellagra. Three of the children 
are in school. Twenty per cent of the people in Kentucky have 
hookworm disease. There are probably few counties in the South 
that do not show twenty per cent of its population infected with 
hookworm disease. Their efficiency is destroyed to the same extent 
as they are afilicted. 
Fifth Pictwre-—(Another poor, ignorant, uncared-for family.) 
Not one of these children are in school. None of them have ever been 
in school; neither have the parents. They have never been in a 
church. The knowledge of a salvation that is offered freely to all 
men through the revelations of the Scriptures had never been told 
to these people, and they live within less than a hundred miles of 
the city of Louisville—not in Africa or in the islands of the Pacific! 
Every member of that family had hookworm disease; none of them 
had ever had a doctor. Observe their swollen faces and pot bellies. 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 155 
That family had been able to exist for two or three generations 
without the moral, without the mental, without the physical de- 
velopment that a human being ought to have; yet there is a school 
within half a mile of them. The school teacher there and the doc- 
tor there had not heard of hookworm disease, and after we investi- 
gated conditions there, we found it necessary to treat the doctor’s 
whole family. 
Sith Picture—This boy has pellagra. (Listless, unhealthy 
young boy.) 
Seventh Picture.—These are diphtheria germs. You know the 
local point of attack in diphtheria is in the membrane in the back of 
the throat. These germs are the seed of this disease, exactly as the 
grains of corn are corn seed. The'germs sprout in the individual, 
and the prevalence of the disease is due largely to our carelessness. 
There never was and there never will be a case of diphtheria without 
a person’s first getting these in his nose or throat. If every teacher 
in the world today would teach his or her pupils that there are 
diphtheria germs, and if any pupil has them in his throat, that pupil 
has diphtheria, and should be given anti-toxin by a reliable physi- 
cian quickly, and that no one can contract that disease from that 
pupil except through his carelessness, we would soon. wipe out this 
dread disease. Germs are carried through expectoration and on 
bedding, etc. If a child with diphtheria is lying in bed and no one 
but a competent nurse and doctor, properly dressed for handling 
this contagious disease, is permitted to enter his room, there is 
no danger of spreading the disease from this patient, unless some 
one is criminally negligent. The doctor should wear a washable 
suit of clothes or overalls and a mask over his face while he is in 
the room with the patient, and his clothes and all other clothes in 
the room should be washed and sterilized or hung in the sunshine 
to dry, as sunshine is one of the best disinfectants we have. He 
should not wear the same clothes for two cases. The nurse should 
also use every precaution to prevent contagion. She should remain 
apart from the members of the household, and no one of the family 
should be permitted to enter the patient’s room unless he uses the 
same precautions as the doctor. The doctor should wear rubber 
gloves or wash his hands thoroughly, using a disinfectant. You 
people realize how hard it would be if you had some member of 
your family ill with diphtheria in your home, and you could not go 
out of your house for twelve or thirteen weeks; yet this is what you 
ought to do unless you stay absolutely outside of the patient’s room. 
If you do not, you will carry the disease to some other person.
-P-A-G-E-156
156 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
That is what is being done daily everywhere diphtheria is spreading. 
Now what is the first thing to do in our fight against diphtheria 
until you teachers have taught your pupils how to prevent its 
spread? The child has a little sore throat; doctor says it is diph- 
theria. Every doctor immediately gives anti-toxin. I have given 
immunizing doses to seventy-two children in one school who had 
been exposed. Throat washes are insufficient to kill the germs. 
Even if the germs are few at first, their development is so rapid that 
no other precaution will do. Some people claim that doctors 
scatter more diseases than anyone else. I do not defend doctors. 
If half of the doctors should stop practicing, the health of the people 
would be better. (Laughter.) And the reason many of the pres- 
ent generation of doctors are such poor ones is because they had 
such poor teachers up to the time of entering medical school. 
(Laughter.) We. cannot keep those who have already been gradu- 
ated from practicing, unless we have a definite case of malpractice 
against them; but through State examinations of applicants for 
physician’s licenses we are keeping a great many incompetents from 
getting started up. (Applause.) 
Highth Picture—This is the bacteria of typhoid fever. This is 
the germ that is doing such deadly work among our people. Typhoid 
fever can be contracted only from the bowel movement and urine 
of people that have typhoid fever. There is only one way to get 
typhoid fever. You get some of this urine or bowel movement 
into your digestive system through your mouth. Now get this 
idea: there are no other causes. If all of the urine and all of the 
bowel movements could be put into a place where it could not be car- 
ried into our food or milk or water by flies, there would be no more 
typhoid fever. Just think what it would mean to the people of 
our country if there were no typhoid fever. More money is spent 
on typhoid fever in the Southern States than is spent on education. 
Think of the effect of this upon education in the South, if we could 
eradicate this disease. Think of the tremendous financial benefit 
which would accrue to our people if there were no more typhoid 
fever. More money is spent on this than is spent for maintaining 
the government of all the towns, counties and states. Think what 
it would mean to our school system if that money could be spent on 
our schools. Think what it would mean to our population if the 
children and young adults who have died from this disease could 
have been saved. It is more preventable than smallpox or diph- 
theria. If you can properly dispose of all bowel movements and 
urine, you will stop typhoid fever.
-P-A-G-E-157
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 157 
Question : Is this a settled fact of the medical profession, or do 
not some claim that certain conditions may originate in the human 
system whereby this germ may be created? 
It is a settled fact. You cannot originate typhoid fever germs 
in your system any more than you can originate corn or beans. 
Ninth Picture-—(Tuberculosis germs.) One-sixth of the funerals 
in Kentucky are caused by these germs. When a man with con- 
sumption expectorates, he spits poison that is just as deadly as if 
it were strychnine. People suffering from tuberculosis should 
always spit in a paper cup, which should be immediately burned 
after using. If the proper care is taken, tuberculosis can be 
stopped. Think what this would mean. It is preventable; why 
not stop it? We are getting rid of tubercular cows. The farmers 
object to killing them because they are worth $30 or $40—evi- 
dently thinking the life of the child is not worth so much; but 
these cows are being killed. 
Tenth Picture.—(Enlarged photograph of the hookworm.) This 
is the most important source of disease that we have to contend 
with. It is one of the greatest problems with which the Southern 
Educational Association will have to deal. Tuberculosis kills a 
great many more people; the hookworm undermines mind and body 
without destroying the spark of life itself, leaving the patient list- 
less, inefficient to do his share of the world’s work, unable to take 
an interest in anything worth while, at the same time rendering him 
the easier victim of all other infectious diseases, especially of tuber- 
culosis. This is also an economic problem. 
Bleventh Picture.—This is an enlarged picture of the eggs of the 
hookworm. If we could only get a cross between these and the 
domestic hen, we would have a good combination. I will refer that 
to the agricultural department. (Laughter.) 
Twelfth Pictwre—This is an enlarged photograph showing the 
hookworm in the digestive system. The worm is seen sucking the 
red corpuscles from the blood. If it sucks enough blood from the 
child, it dwarfs him. The child may have enough worms to dwarf 
him very much, or only enough to reduce his efficiency. On the 
other hand, these worms squirt the infectious matter from the 
bowels into the blood stream. When this is the case, we have the 
pot bellies and swollen faces and legs, and, frequently, death. 
Thirteenth Picture—This is a photograph of ninety-six children 
with one teacher. Every single, solitary one had hookworm dis- 
ease. They had not been able to keep a teacher because there was 
not much for the teacher to do. (Laughter.) His only duty was to

keep them away from home. Such pictures as this have usually 
come from surveys in rural districts. Jefferson County, Kentucky, 
is the first county containing a large city where these examinations 
have been made. This disease is prevalent here, though, of course, 
in a smaller proportion than throughout the rural communities of 
the South. But it is a community disease, and the health and 
fiscal authorities of Jefferson County are wise in checking it while 
a relatively small part of their population is affected by it. 
Fourteenth Pictwre.—(A dilapidated wooden cabin of one or two 
rooms.) You can scarcely believe it, but this is a schoolhouse in 
which eighty-one children gather for the purpose of securing an 
education. There are two windows, but both are tightly nailed 
down. ‘The boys usually manage to keep the window panes broken, 
however, with their baseballs. . What chance have children in such 
environment for a larger life? 
Fifteenth Picture-—(A dilapidated outhouse, very small, with no 
water connection. This is the toilet of that schoolhouse. The 
educational standing—rather the patriotic standing—of a commu- 
nity should be based upon the sanitary condition of its toilets. The 
toilet shown in this picture is a fair sample of what is found in all 
rural communities in the South. 
Siateenth Pictwre——(Another small outhouse, woodwork in good 
condition, with fancy trimming around the top; equally as unsani- 
tary as the preceding type, as it had no water connection or other 
means of preventing disease from being contracted in it.) Ladies 
and gentlemen, that man evidently had an architect to design that. 
(Laughter.) This shows the ignorance of the people, which must 
be overcome before we can have a healthy community. Many people 
would like to have their places sanitary, but they do not know how 
to make them so. The name given these hotbeds of disease means 
a private place. <A privy is a place where a man is going to arrange 
to distribute this kind of poison, the idea of privacy is the only 
idea that has obtained in this country. No thought of prevention 
of disease is given them. Another peculiar feature we observed 
was the almost unanimous placing of the toilet, when there was one, 
above the house, or water supply, in rural communities. If every 
teacher in the South had given specific instructions in this particu- 
lar, that method could not have been more uniformly carried out. 
(Laughter.) In many sections we found the only toilet provided 
for school boys and girls was a rail fence corner. It is almost 
enough to bring tears to the eyes to see them exposed to such dan- 
ger. This lack of sanitation in the toilets of our rural communi-

ties is the reason why you see poor, old women, who are only thirty- 
four years of age, stooped, stunted in their growth. It is absolutely 
impossible for them to strive for an ideal of any kind. Their 
bodies need the first attention. They barely eke out an existence. 
That their education has been leglected is largely our fault—prama- 
rily the fault of the medical profession. Now that we have waked 
up, it is time for you to awaken. We will make the South healthy, 
if we do the work that ought to and can be done here, and we will 
make the population so thick, they will forget they ever had a war. 
(Applause. ) 
Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is the solution of the rural toilet 
problem: Dr. Coates, our Rural School Supervisor, is a construc- 
tive statesman of the highest order. He said that we must work out 
a plan whereby sanitary toilets could be built in rural communities 
of such simple construction that the people themselves could build 
them complete, and that the cost of each must not be over $10. No 
one had yet thought of a plan which would meet all of these require- 
ments, so I came to Professor Mark, our State Sanitary Engineer, 
and put the proposition before him. I said to him: “Professor 
Mark, this must be done and the sooner the better, and we 
must build this foundation for the education of the Southern people 
before we do anything else. You must work it out for us some way. 
If it takes you five years or a hundred years, you must doit. After 
working on it for many months, he solved the problem. It is as 
simple as it can be made, and the cost is very little. Any of you 
can get full information regarding the building of these toilets by 
writing to Prof. E. H. Mark, Bowling Green, Ky. He has also blue 
prints of the design. Many of these are now in use. 
Seventeenth Picture—(Architect’s design of proposed sanitary 
toilet.) The boys dig a deep hole, inside of which they build a con- 
crete box. Separate toilets are built for the boys and girls. The 
hole was three and one-half or four feet wide, six or eight feet long, 
all levelled and sides smoothed; then they made a concrete floor in 
it. The usual fault in mixing concrete is that not enough water is 
put into the mixture. Use plenty of water. That is the only way 
to make it water-tight. If you will use more water than is usuaily 
used and less cement, you will have better concrete. When the 
concrete part was finished, they built a frame of tight boards. 
(You could use pieces of galvanized iron or tin, if you have them.) 
Inside the building, they put a frame all around the box. (You can 
make partitions of concrete or wood, as you prefer. Concrete was 
used here in the case I am describing.) After they made the inside     
-P-A-G-E-160
   
    
    
          160 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
frame which was four inches deep, they poured in the cement. The 
cement should be about as thick as buttermilk. After they poured 
in the concrete, they levelled it, then they put in their frames for 
the two partitions. After this was done, they built a water-tight 
cover over the whole thing. The outlet pipe was made of ordinary 
ditch tile covered with cement. This completed the building. The ex- 
pense to the county did not exceed $6. In many cases the labor 
is given gratis by the farmers and the boys, and the sand and water 
are hauled by them. The cement was the only thing we had to buy. 
The outlet pipe was laid so that the refuse was carried away from 
the toilet, out under the lawns, where it fertilized the ground, and 
the lawns are now beautiful, and the danger to the pupils is entirely 
removed. The water which carries away the refuse is placed in a 
tank above the toilet, from which it runs down into the concrete box 
through a pipe. For eleven persons, four gallons of water are 
required each day. 
Question: Should you not use lime in certain communities? 
No. If you want to add a fourth chamber, in which sulphate of 
copper is used, you may do so; but the water is all that is necessary. 
If preferred, a shovelful of horse manure can be thrown into the box 
one time in order to hurry the nitrifying, but it is not absolutely 
essential. 
If the people will only learn that distributing poison of this kind 
is murder just the same as killing a man with a revolver, or the 
careless driving of an automobile, the unsanitary toilet will be a 
thing of the past in a very short time. (Applause.) 
Adjourned until afternoon. 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON. 
Called to order by President Whitfield. 
Dr. WHITFIELD: I certainly regret that so splendid a representa- 
tive of the teaching profession has to make her address to so small 
an audience. It affords me exceptional pleasure to present to you 
Miss Annie E. Moore, Instructor in Elementary and Kindergarten 
Education, Teachers’ College, Columbia University. 
Miss Moore: It is very delightful to address a Southern audi- 
ence, especially an audience in my own home city. I might begin 
by announcing my subject, “Impressions of the Montessori Schools 
in Rome,” and tersely but truthfully complete my talk in one brief 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 161 
sentence, merely by saying, ‘There are no Montessori Schools in 
Rome,” and finish my talk in considerably less time than the allotted 
twenty minutes. However, if there are no Montessori Schools in 
Rome, you will wish to hear something about these schools in Rome 
which are trying to carry out, at least, some of Dr. Montessori’s 
ideas. 
We get all kinds of letters asking about these schools, showing a 
very widespread interest in the subject, and the questions come 
couched in very peculiar terms often. The last letter we received 
was from a lawyer up in the Northwest somewhere, asking us to send 
him information regarding the “Marconi Schools.” We are con- 
stantly asked about wireless messages (laughter). I do not know 
whether that refers to the progress the children make or whether it 
refers to its wildfire manner of transmission, or to its spread over the 
country. It is often called that ‘Marconi Method.” 
There is a very interesting and remarkable article in McClure’s 
Magazine in the May number of 1907, followed by other articles. 
The statements in these articles were of a nature so startling to the 
public because of the amazing results claimed to have been obtained 
by the use of the Montessori method that it is no wonder people are 
interested. The terms used, calling the founder a ‘‘wonder-worker” 
and a “worker of miracles,” and calling the system one which has 
revolutionized education, the results being nothing short of miracu- 
lous, awakened the keenest interest of American educators. Dr. 
Montessori herself makes no such claim. She considers that her 
experiments are tentative. She is still devoting as much of her time 
to this work as she can, but she has an immense number of visitors, 
scores of people having been turned toward the Eternal City. Noth- 
ing can check that tide. Some have gone to her to gratify their 
curiosity regarding the woman; others have gone for the purpose of 
serious investigation. Their feet are turned toward these five or 
six little schools started in the slum district in Rome, and no city in 
the world, not even New York, has such poor districts as the city of 
Rome. 
We started less than six years ago, and Dr. Montessori considered 
it a high compliment when she was called upon to co-operate with 
Signor Tallamo in the Social Settlement Building. They were very 
anxious to have this started for the benefit of the children in the 
tenements. 
Dr. Montesorri has been seeking an opportunity to experiment 
with normal children, and she and Signor Tallamo will then co-op- 
erate with each other. Her work so far has been exclusively among 
ll
-P-A-G-E-162
  162 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
defective children. We were told, however, by clear statements from 
the Common Building Association that the settlement schools are 
not Montessori Schools. There are educators who will say that the 
work of Dr. Montesorri is beneath their notice; but a careful study 
will show that her methods contain some excellent points, even though 
her system is imperfect. Few people know what Dr. Montessori is 
trying to do and appreciate her work and at the present time few of 
the schools are co-operating with her. As a result of that, there is 
really only one school which represents Dr. Montessori. With this 
one exception the schools in Rome are not Montessori Schools, and 
there is no school in Rome where the methods described in Dr. Mont- 
sesori’s book are fully carried out. But when we investigate the sys- 
tem of education in Rome which is now being used, we are glad to find 
that it is not the Montessori method, for if they were, we would have 
nothing to gain from them. The exception I mentioned is in the 
Beni Stabili School. (My opinions of her method are based upon 
her books rather than any of the schools in Rome, because her ideas 
are not fully carried out even in this school.) This Beni Stabili 
School is the only one which has the sanction of Dr. Montessori, and 
admission to it is made only by Dr. Montessori’s card. We may draw 
some conclusions from this particular school because it was founded 
upon the Montessori idea and comes nearer than any other to carry- 
ing out her method. 
Tn the first place, the teachers in this school were trained by Dr. 
Montessori, and they had closer association with her than anyone in 
this country. They had better training. They had the benefit of 
Dr. Montessori’s supervision, so it seems hardly possible that they 
ean have drifted far from her ideals, as it has been such a short time 
since her hand was removed from them. There the kindergarten 
children are under the care of the best prepared teachers. The Beni 
Stabili Schools are conducted by the Franciscan Sisters. The Di- 
rector there received full training from Dr. Montessori. She was 
appointed by Dr. Montessori and she uses Dr. Montessori’s method 
in her work. Visitors are admitted from ten o’clock until one, when 
the Director is in charge. At other times the nuns are in charge. - 
If we should enter that little school at ten o’clock you would find 
three children sitting at each of the little tables beginning to select 
the material with which they wish to employ themselves at that time. 
They will receive the materia! from the teacher and then begin using 
it. As you would be allowed to be there for only three hours, during 
which time they are using the didactic material, you will only see a 
part of the work that Dr. Montessori stands for. It is also true that
-P-A-G-E-163
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 163 
much that Dr. Montessori says exists, as I have said, only on paper. 
There are large, vacant areas. These ideas she has expressed in her 
book are things she has devoutly desired. I will mention some of 
the large, vacant areas—some of the things covered in her book, but 
not to be seen in the Roman schools—gardening, care of pets, work 
in rythym, music—very little done with music, and the gymnastic 
apparatus, as you see it in the book, is fascinating, but these are not 
in any of the schools there. 
Now, it is said that Americans center too much on the Montessori 
material, that we are disposed to give too much attention to the di- 
dactic material. There is a reason why we should do this. More 
than half of her book is given up to discussing how she evolved this 
material or to questions of its use. The time when the paid Director 
is in the Beni Stabili School is the time when the didactic material is 
being used. For all of these reasons it becomes apparent that Dr. 
Montessori and her followers consider this feature of the work of 
paramount importance, and some of the most important principles 
of the whole theory depend almost entirely upon this material, and 
certainly there are many principles, while not depending absolutely 
upon the material, they are largely involved in its use. 
As we go back to the school, the children are working on this didac- 
tic material. There are three points regarding this material to which 
I wish to call your attention: 
First—There are only certain things to which the material lends 
itself; 
Second—Their use of it also will be regulated by specific lessons 
as to what is to be done with this material, which naturally very 
largely determines what the children shall do with it, and 
Third—They are limited in the use of the material by the authority 
of the Director. (They use the word Director instead of teacher.) 
This, in my opinion, tends to dwarf the ingenuity of the child. This 
is the work of the didactic material. The material itself is intended 
to do the teaching. The teaching process goes on automatically by 
the nature of the material. They may sit or stand, while at work. 
They may pass the material from one child to another and may change 
the material if they wish. 
There are three difierent. types of sdistatnal: Some of the children 
work in that absorbed concentrated way in which the material is 
intended to be used. There are a Director and five or six assistants 
with twenty-five children. A few of the little ones can not be induced 
to use the material unless some older person is with them, or unless 
some older person is going through the exercises with them. Then
-P-A-G-E-164
    164 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
there are other children who wish to use the material in other ways 
than the material is designed for. So we get these three types of 
children. It would be impossible in the short time I have here to 
show this material. I have to assume that you have some knowledge 
of the material. One of the striking things about this material is 
that it provides for absolutely no variation because of its peculiar 
construction. The striking thing about the kindergarten material 
is that it is plastic. It lends itself to the children’s desires. The 
elementary part of education is one of the largest in evolution. 
This material must be designed so that it cannot have variation. 
If the child is left with the material, it must be limited to what the 
teacher desires the child to do. Variation is absolutely left out until 
the child reaches the point where he writes outlines with crayon. 
When the child can use cut-out letters and express himself through 
the building of the sentences, then that admits of some variation. 
Play, as we know play, is absolutely unknown in these schools. 
Dr. Montessori, in her book, ‘speaks of play in a derogatory way. 
She uses the term ‘‘game’’. Games in her opinion should mean “‘activ- 
ity directed to a definite end, not disorderly noise that distracts the 
attention.” 
The tiny children will have luncheon perpared by the older ones 
and these children are only five and six years old. Then they go out 
with one of the nuns into their beautiful garden, where they engage 
in games that are fairly chosen and well adapted to the children. 
Naturally they do not play with the vigor of the average American 
child. Dr. Montessori has given a relatively short time to work 
with normal children, her service having been given to defective 
children. This has resulted in a rather narrow viewpoint and also 
in her peculiar attitude toward play. It is a well known fact that 
idiotic children do not play. The term “educational gymnastics,” 
as we understand it, is regarded by her asa derogatory term. They 
are trying to perfect an organization which will work toward the end 
that all things of life shall require certain responsibility. 
They do not work in an imaginative or creative way with their 
materials. They rarely show any disposition to construct or use that 
material in a creative way. 
We know that normal children react in quite a different way from 
defective children through the sense impressions. The pupils from two 
and one-half to six years of age do crave an opportunity to use the 
sense of touch. They have a real sense hunger, and they get these 
sense impressions if they have a fairly rich environment. Dr. Mon- 
tessori seems to have left out of her conception of the child the auto-
-P-A-G-E-165
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 165 
education, which is going on in the matter of sense training, even if 
we are not using labor and carefully devised material to give that 
sense training. Dr. Montessori makes very small provision for the 
child’s reaction to materials which he is interested in the use of; what 
he can do with them to give such impressions of color, form, size and 
texture, from what he is doing with that material. Imagination has 
no place in the Montessori method. The children are told no fairy 
stories. Not many people would agree with her on that. She does 
not believe in using imaginative work merely to give pleasure. There 
is no opportunity for the superactive imagination. Imaginative play 
is discouraged. There is an entire neglect of literature in these schools. 
We cannot believe that a system which discourages all play, love of 
stories and the imaginative, constructive use of materials to a large 
extent, can educate the entire personality of the normal child. 
There are some very suggestive phases of the Montessori schools. 
One of the most striking is the use they make of freedom. I do not 
know of any school where the children enjoy the happy freedom 
that we see in these schools; still there is no spirit of anarchy. It 
seems that each child may do what he chooses, that he is a little auto- 
crat, but no one of them is permitted to transgress upon the rights of 
the others. They are allowed to talk, but they must not be annoying. 
There is simply a little buzz of conversation. The teacher is only 
concerned with one child at a time. If you are instructing one child, 
you can allow greater freedom than you can in class work. They do 
very little class work without the Director. Now, this principle of 
freedom is needed more in our primary schools than in our kindergar- 
tens. When we go into any of our kindergartens, we find the children 
given almost as much freedom as they would have at home, but in our 
primary schools, it would be only here and there dotted about the 
country, that we would see anything which approaches the happy, 
wholesome freedom, and the opportunity for children to carry out 
their own wholesome desires, such as we find in the Beni Stabili school. 
Strange to say, there is very little real initiative among these children, 
for the reason that the things which they are doing are of such a lim- 
ited character that there is but limited opportunity for them to take 
the initiative. They do the thing that is implied in the material they 
are working with. 
We try to connect our schools with life. We have not attained 
this. We have made some progress in this direction, but our system 
is imperfect. For this purpose the disciplinary exercises are used in 
the Montessori schools. Next to this freedom, of which I have 
spoken, their exercises of practical life are the most suggestive. They 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
166 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
learn to take responsibility. Little tots two and three years old have 
certain things to do for the week, and they do them with joy; they do 
. them in a responsible way. Some one does not say, ‘You are to take 
the dust off the floor to-day; you are to clean the silver to-day, etc.” 
They know their duties and they do them. 
Dr. Montessori has certainly made a contribution to education in 
the matter of teaching writing. They use large letters, from which 
the children get the muscular feeling and from that pattern, they 
learn to form the letters. While it seems to me that they use an ex- 
cessive amount of that feeling, in studying out geometric forms, it 
certainly gives the pupils a better knowledge of writing than the mus- 
cular movement circles which our children practice on for so many 
weeks. 
They are not as careful as they should be with the children’s eyes. 
As I entered the room, I saw a little fellow with tears in his eyes. I 
was there two hours and no attention was paid to this. I looked at 
the child’s eyes and found they were strained. 
In reading, I think Dr. Montessori has revealed very little to us in 
America. Her method of phonics, if we adopted it, would mean our 
going back to our earliest form of giving phonetic value to our words. 
All the teacher there has to do is to pronounce the word distinctly 
and it will spell itself, but there is a difference between Italian and 
English spelling. 
Pror. R. P. HALLECK, Louisville, Ky.: What is this mysterious 
material? 
Miss Moore: I do not think I can explain exactly. There are 
so many different kinds of materials which they use. It would take 
too long for me to tell you about them. I was under the impression 
that you had read something about these materials. 
Her theory is based upon the sense training. She seems to feel that 
the organ itself can be improved. Her theory is that if you train the 
child carefully, and if the child can differentiate color, form and size of 
objects, he has a sort of stock in trade. It is all wrapped up in formal 
discipline which our psychologists rejected several years ago. In 
live materials, Dr. Montessori’s ideal is to have gardens, but the child- 
. ren are not now doing any gardening. Dr. Montessori thinks we 
should not try to help the child to make his connection with life. She 
) thinks we should train his powers. Weare to keep him as an individ- 
| ual. Weare to train his senses so that he will see more than most peo- 
| ple see, hear more than most people hear, so that when he goes out 
| ; into life, he can make his own connections.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 167 
Pror. HELLACK: Yes, but what are the materials? We do not 
know what you mean by that term. Can you not give us some idea 
of what they are? 
Miss Moore: Well, they use, for instance, long blocks of wood, dif- 
fering in diameter and altitude or a wooden box with an adjustable lid. 
A little child took off and put on the lid of a box seventy-nine times 
just for the enjoyment of doing it. Then they have boxes containing 
removable cylinders. The children take out and put in these cylinders 
over and over and over again until they weary of doing so. They 
put the small ones within the larger ones, etc., many times, the idea 
being that by this means they can classify the size and gradation of 
the various objects. The child is taught to name some of the geo- 
metric forms of the materials. It is taught to feel around the edges 
to learn through the sense of touch the shapes of the different objects. 
We saw children who got these lessons perfectly. This training is 
supposed to lead them into writing after the child has gotten the sense 
of form. When they learn this, they cut out sand-paper letters. 
There is one thing to be commented upon in connection with this 
part of the work. They build upon the principles of differentiation 
and gradation, and do nothing else with this material. Some chil- 
dren show the greatest ingenuity in making railroad cars, etc., but 
when they do this the Director stops them. ‘They have ignored some 
of the very prominent interests of the child while they have provided 
excellently for some others. 
Pror. HALLECK: Miss Moore, is Dr. Montessori a trained psy- 
chologist? 
Miss Moore: Yes, Dr. Montessori is well trained in psychology 
and in pedagogy. She is a splendidly educated woman. 
Pror. McConatnhy, Louisville, Ky.: Does Madame Montessori 
base this sense training upon the idea that the organ of sense can be 
improved by science so that a more perfect image of the object will 
be impressed upon the mind? 
Miss Moore: She does not distinctly say so, but in a passage of 
her book, she states that she is following Seguin’s belief that the organ 
ean be improved. 
PRESIDENT WHITFIELD: Do you think her results justify the 
work? 
Miss Moore: Her results are remarkable in certain ways—in 
their very early writing, their independence their responsibility and
-P-A-G-E-168

their use of freedom. I do not think her results in reading are re- 
markable. Her teaching of certain phases of practical life is worthy 
of commendation. A child learns to dress himself, to set the table, 
to take care of a room and to take care of his own things. These all 
have a direct bearing upon life, but her ae does not touch life 
itself at any other point. 
I will give you a summary of my impressions of this system of edu- 
cation: 
1. The formal sense training prominent. In this method is a part 
of the doctrine of formal discipline rejected by leading psychologists 
years ago. 
2. There is an entire neglect of the imagination and little is done 
to develop aesthetic appreciation. 
8. The principle of auto-education is a valuable one, but is, at 
present, worked out only in a very limited way. 
_ 4, Many important native instincts are ignored. 
5. Some of the apparatus could. be used to advantage in connec- 
tion with the more varied kindergarten material. 
6. It is useless to introduce the material as a whole into our 
schools unless we believe in the theory on which it rests and intend 
to use it in a thoroughgoing way. 
7. In estimating the results accomplished in a regular Mon- 
tessori school, the long school day, and the small number of pupils 
per teacher must be taken into account. (Applause.) 
PRESIDENT WHITFIELD: The next on the program is a paper by 
Miss Lena Gertrude Roling, Supervisor of Primary Grades, Alle- 
gany County Public Schools, Maryland. Her subject is “The Train- 
ing of the Senses—The Basis of an Individual’s Education.” I 
have the privilege of presenting to you Miss Roling. 
THE TRAINING OF THE SENSES—THE BASIS OF AN INDIVIDUAL’S 
EDUCATION. 
LENA GERTRUDE ROLING. 
“The intellect is perfected not by knowledge, but by exercise.” 
—Aristotle. 
The degree in which our minds will be athletic and aesthetic de- 
pends upon what we have seen, heard, smelled, tasted and touched. 
It is obvious, therefore, that all mental activity presupposes and starts 
with knowledge gained through the senses, and that in order to in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 169 
crease our capacity for mental growth, we must increase the exercise 
of the senses, and take the utmost care of the organs through which 
our knowledge is obtained. 
The oldest, biggest and most fundamental end organ we have is 
our sensitive skin—1,584,300 square millimeters in extent. Woods 
Hutchinson has called the human skin one of the wonders of the 
world—‘“‘a tissue more beautiful than velvet, more pliable than silk, 
more endurable under exposure than steel.” Man is provided with 
hundreds of thousands of touch organs, from which delicate nerve 
fibers lead to the spinal chord. Our whole physical organism is lit- 
erally possessed by a myriad of tactile neurons. No other sense lies 
so close to our personality and to our realization of the objective 
world. 
The development of the sense of touch proceeds very rapidly and 
begins with the tactile impressions of mouth, cheek and body when 
the little baby is nestled in its mother’s arms. It knows her touch 
long before it knows her voice or face. Contact with soft, warm 
surroundings awaken a pleasurable feeling. The sense of touch not 
only aids the child in his investigation of the outside world, but 
enables him to distinguish himself, that is to say, his body, from all 
other objects. At first his attention is expressed only in staring and 
wonder. Soon he begins to handle every object which comes within 
his reach, even his own body, especially his feet, and one hand with 
the other. He is actively curious and accumulates tactile experience 
on his own initiative. Touch is bound up at every point with the 
muscles. At first everything is carried to the mouth where the sense 
of touch is particularly keen in the lips and tip of the tongue. 
The child enjoys the mere contact, it gives him pleasure to test 
with his lips everything that offers an occasion for the use of his nerves 
and muscles. Later he reaches, clasps, creeps, walks, throws, tears, 
breaks and builds up. The fact that he trusts more to his sense of 
touch than he does to his sight testifies to its value. He gets into 
mischief, and at the same time into a knowledge of things through 
the ceaseless manipulation of his hands. To prohibit little children 
from handling is to very seriously limit their mental development. 
They should be given all sorts of objects to touch, to handle, and to 
compare with each other—things that are rough, smooth, hard, soft, 
scratchy, slippery, sharp, dull, fluid, sticky, metallic, glassy, edged, 
round, ete., all sorts of fabrics, furs, and leather in all sorts of shapes. 
Toys ought to be selected with a view to supplying this experience. 
They should be colored with bright and pure colors that will do no 
harm if sucked off.
-P-A-G-E-170

If the opportunities are good, handling and manual activity will 
put vividness and content into the perception of the outside world. 
With the handling of tools the child will acquire enough about the 
arts to give him an appreciation for things that have been and are 
being made by man. He cannot get this appreciation by reading, 
by listening, by observing—he must get it through his muscles, his 
skin and his tendons. He must have an opportunity to handle and 
to stroke. Such a contact experience will establish a warm tactile 
sympathy for the object, and supply a wealth of artistic enjoyment. 
Every child needs a rich range of touch experiences—of the delicate, 
for the appreciation of things refined; of the grosser, for the apprecia- 
tion of things strong, stately and sublime. Helen Keller says: 
“Through the sense of touch I know the faces of friends, the illim- 
itable variety of straight and curved lines, all surfaces, the exuberance 
of the soil, the delicate shapes of flowers, the noble forms of trees and 
the range of mighty winds.” . . . “The thousand soft voices of 
the earth have truly found their way to me—the small rustle in tufts 
of grass, the silky swish of leaves, the buzz of insects, the hum of bees 
in blossoms I have plucked, the flutter of a bird’s wings after his 
bath, and the slender rippling vibration of water running over pebbles. 
Once having been felt, these loved voices rustle, buzz, hum, flutter, 
and ripple in my thought forever, an undying part of happy memo- 
ries.” “Truly in touch is all love and intelligence.” It is most 
intimately associated with the fundamental instincts of workman- 
ship, hunger, sex, curiosity, fighting and sympathy. 
Taste is an ideal activity. The individuality of an object is at- 
tacked and gives way to suffering dissolution. Substances that do not 
yield to the juices of the mouth have no taste. Sigismund tells us 
that taste is the first of all the senses to yield clear perceptions which 
are stored up in memory. This is certainly what one would expect 
for the chief states of pleasure in the life of a young baby recur many 
times daily in association with feeding. So education begins with 
eating, and if it is not properly taught the child may soon become 
dyspeptic, if it does not actually die, and goes through life ham- 
pered physically, mentally and morally. As a rule the child prefers 
sweets from its birth, and will reject anything bitter, sour or salt, 
and, until the later development of smell is perfected, it is incapable 
of more delicate sense distinctions. With children we find that such 
distinctions are less varied than among adults, the sweet of candy 
and the acid of fruits furnishing the staple material for their playful 
use of this sense. On one occasion my attention was drawn to a 
descriptive wine list in which the following terms were applied:
-P-A-G-E-171
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 171 
strong, fiery, soft, fresh, lovely, sharp, elegant, hard, spicy, fruity 
and smooth. I wondered to what degree of intoxication an individ- 
ual must reach to connect such various associations with the pleas- 
ures of the palate. 
The sense of smell is closely associated with the sense of taste, and 
its importance for health is obvious, both to warn us against the 
inhalation of impure gases and vapors and to guard us from eating 
putrescent foods which are accompanied by a disagreeable odor. 
Helen Keller declares that “for some inexplicable reason the sense of 
smell does not hold the high position it deserves among its sisters. 
There is something of the fallen angel about it. When it woos us 
with woodland scents and beguiles us with the fragrance of lovely 
gardens, it is admitted frankly to our discourse. But when it gives 
us warning of something noxious in our vicinity it is treated as if 
the demon had got the upper hand of the angel, and is relegated to 
outer darkness, punished for its faithful service.” 
The dominant character of this sense among the ancients is re- 
corded in the use they made of incense and essences to compel emo- 
tional force. Even the Oracleat Delphi gained a celebrity wide as 
the world through the medium of the Pythian priestess, as seated 
upon a tripod placed above deep fissures in the rocks from which 
arose stupefying vapors, she uttered the messages of the god. 
Olfactory experiences linger long in the memory. The odors of 
mountain and field and flower are present in the poems and pictures 
of poet and artist. Who can think of Maud Muller without the 
nostrils dilating with the smell of new mown hay? Or who could 
disassociate James Lane Allen from the pungent odor of Kentucky’s 
hemp fields? Would the portrayal of a pine forest be complete with- 
out suggestions of its aroma? Can there be a sensation more delight- 
ful than the invisible sweetness which fills the world in the spring of 
the year as it comes filtering through sun-warmed and wind-tossed 
branches of delicate blossoms? Whittier speaks of the potent witch- 
ery of smell in his beautiful little poem “Sweet Fern.” 
“T climbed a hill path strange and new, 
With slow feet, pausing at each turn; 
A sudden waft of west wind blew 
The breath of the sweet fern. 
“That fragrance from my vision swept 
The alien landscape; in its stead, 
Up fairer hills of youth I stepped, 
As light of heart as tread.  
-P-A-G-E-172
  72 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
“T saw my boyhood’s lakelet shine 
Once more through rifts of woodland shade; 
I knew my rivers winding line 
By morning mist betrayed. 
“With me June’s freshness, lapsing brook, 
Murmurs of leaf and bee, the call 
Of birds, and one in voice and look 
In keeping with them all. 
“A fern bends the way we went, 
She plucked, and, smiling, held it up, 
While from her hand the wild sweet scent 
I drank as from a cup. 
“O potent witchery of smell! 
The dust-dry leaves to life return, 
And she who plucked them owns the spell 
And lifts her ghostly fern. 
“Or sense or spirit? Who shall say 
What touch the chord of memory thrills? 
It passed, and left the August day 
Ablaze on lonely hills.’’ 
Helen Keller says: “Human odors are as varied and capable of 
recognition as hands and faces. The dear odors of those I love are 
so definite, so unmistakable, that nothing can quite obliterate them.” 
Sometimes she meets one who lacks a distinctive person scent and 
seldom finds such a one lively or entertaining. On the other hand 
one who has a strong pungent odor she finds possessed of great vital- 
ity, energy and vigor of mind. 
The sense of hearing becomes a source both of pleasure and inter- 
est very early. New sounds and especially musical sounds, at once 
attract attention. And their power of making a child stop fretting 
is daily taken advantage of in the nursery. Children are pleased 
with rhythmical sounds, but their joy is conspicuous when the clatter 
is self-originated either in experimenting with their own vocal organs 
or in making a racket with anything that will serve the purpose, 
such as patting their hands, cracking their knuckles, snapping and 
drumming with their fingers, dragging sticks about, blowing in keys, 
snapping whips, clinking glasses, banging on waiters, creaking and 
slamming doors, rattling paper, running a stick over a picket fence, 
and other sound plays innumerable. 
Oftentimes the making of unpleasant sounds, at which he is a 
master hand, proves attractive to the child in school, and the poor 
unfortunate teacher detects it to her sorrow when the location of the 
offender proves elusive.
-P-A-G-E-173
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 173 
Children are sensitive to rhythmical cadence, even when the 
beauty of melody is lost upon them. They skip about when they 
hear enlivening music as if they wish to catch the rhythmic move- 
ment, an impulse which we all know affects adults as well. They 
show their enjoyment of rhythm, too, in their preference for strongly 
accented poetry. Their ever ready and persistent appeal for a song 
or a story is an instinctive demand for some employment of their 
organs of hearing. While children are much pleased with the har- 
mony and melody and rhythm, their indifference to the words is 
oftentimes most marked. Frequently I wonder how much this is 
due to the model they hear. The carelessness of adults generally 
and teachers in particular, in articulation and pronunciation and 
their frequent grammatical errors are exceeded only by the careless- 
ness of the unfortunate children who listen to them. My sympathy 
goes out to the little ones, they know no better; but for the teachers 
who are conscious of the fact that imitation plays so large a part in 
the child’s acquirement of speech, it is inexcusable. Sounds have an 
emotional power, second only to odors and tactile impressions. Music 
is the language of the emotions. That child’s life of feeling shrinks 
if opportunities are not provided for the influence of this great power. 
They should do and hear much singing, hear and retell many stories, 
hear and recite many poems. But of all sweet sounds the most mar- 
velous and the most important in its sway over the emotions, and, 
in consequence, over behaviour, is the melodious and well modulated 
much loved human voice. Wonders could and would be worked 
in the character and sensibilities of the children if the natural flow 
of sympathy through the human voice would forever displace the 
harsh and unnatural metallic tones of the public school room voice. 
Vision boasts the most exalted position among the senses. It is 
peculiarly the intellectual sense and furnishes a wealth of material 
for the imagination. At a very early period the child is passionately 
fond of light, and to what degree this feeling is universal is shown by 
the fact that bright and shining objects are prized the world over. 
The human longing for light is strong. When the electric light 
blazed for the first time on the frozen-in Fram, Nanson wrote, ‘‘What 
a tremendous influence light has on the spirits of men! The light 
enlivened us like a draught of good wine.” After sensations of light 
sensations of color begin to be noticed. Most observers agree that 
the child displays more interest in the warm colors—red and yellow 
—than in the colder ones. In the remains of buildings and plastic 
work, which are older than any picture writings, traces are found of 
all the colors of the spectrum; their universal presence in natural

scenery, in ornament, and in clothing, in the arts and industries 
offer us a pleasure that is derived from no other source and claims 
a prayer that no effort be spared to familiarize the children with them. 
Lack of aesthetic interest may assume the form of partial color blind- 
ness as is displayed sometimes by educated adults in the extraordi- 
nary want of susceptibility to reflected color. Play and work with 
color should begin early because of the various expressions of taste 
in such matters. 
It is only by slow degrees that a child learns to recognize what an 
object is. The perception of solid form and the recognition of the 
distance of objects is closely associated with the combined use of 
sight and touch. Seeing implies merely an impression. Touch im- 
» plies more. It implies an impression plus an emotional glow. The 
tactile and motor experiences make the physical things tingle with 
values and suggestion. The first requirement for reproduction is 
recognition, which is dependent on form. Evidently the child has 
a very deep interest in form or he could not, without great effort, 
distinguish the meaning of simple outline as readily as he does; a 
circle is a waiter, a triangle is a roof, a square a window, etc. The 
progress of civilization is straining no other organ more than the eye. 
We are becoming eye-minded. Instruction which is eye deep is not 
very deep. Gesell tells us that children are ear-minded and touch- 
minded before they are eye-minded. The child who does not have 
this well-stored background of tactile motor experience may be the 
man who, though he has eyes, sees not. John Lock says, “Use legs 
and have legs”—and so it is with the senses, to increase their efficiency 
they must be exercised. 
In the parable of the talents our Lord says: “For unto every one 
that hath (uses) shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but 
from him that hath not (has, but does not use) shall be taken away 
even that which he hath.” (Matthew XXVII, 29.) “The senses 
are considered the servants of the body; they should be exalted into 
the service of the soul.” Childhood is acknowledged to be the period 
for the education of the senses, but in the main the training of the 
senses isa mental training. It is through the senses that the child is 
gathering material for the mind to act upon. The spirit of investi- 
gation appears early, and all day long through his waking hours the 
child finds the keenest pleasure in touching, hammering, handling 
everything he can lay his hands upon to find out what there is in it 
of noise, and color, and strength and form. Abundant opportunity 
for these early gathering years means freedom to touch and play 
with numbers of common things, things which are valuable above
-P-A-G-E-175
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 175 
all others because they are common and at hand, and can be known so 
as to lead to a knowledge of all things else in the universe. A knowl- 
edge of these common things is the best preparation the children can 
get for their future education. If the child lives in the country there 
is abundant material always at hand, and even in the town there is 
no lack. The need of objects is great. Our education is too often 
confounded with verbal instruction, with word cramming and rote 
learning, and, in consequence, one of the besetting sins of the pri- 
mary school is languor, apathy—apathy in speech, apathy in move- 
ment, apathy in action and apathy in perception, and it all springs 
from an overvaluation of verbal instruction. There would not be 
so many indifferent and inert people in the world if all children could 
come into a more intimate contact with their environment, if they 
could gather together such a collection of materials as will give them 
practice in discriminating sensory qualities, and at the same time 
using their muscles and gratifying their imagination and invention 
in putting these materials together. The best preparation parents 
can give their children for school training is to make them acquainted 
with natural objects, especially with the sights and sounds of the 
country. Every teacher on starting with a new class or in a new 
locality, to make sure that his efforts are not entirely lost, should 
undertake to explore children’s minds with all the tact and ingenuity 
he can command and acquire, to determine what is already known. 
In conclusion, let me quote from the celebrated Dr. Seguin, who 
says: “The senses must be educated, so that if the use of any be 
lost, another may feel and perceive for it. The same provision is 
to be made for the use of both sides of the body, the left being made 
competent to do anything for the right. But, instead of this, the 
present use of our senses is nearly empirical. No mechanic uses well 
enough at first sight all the parts of an engine; no draughtsman 
draws his pencil exactly where he means to; no painter can create 
the shades he has before him; no physician has tact perfect enough 
for the requirements of his profession; the imperfection of our sen- 
sorial and motive education always betrays, instead of executing the 
dictates of our will. Let our natural senses be developed as far as 
possible and we are not near the limits of their capacity. Then the 
instruments of artificial senses are to be brought in requisition; the 
handling of the compass, the prism, the most philosophical of them, 
the microscope and others must be made familiar to all children 
who shall learn how to see nature through itself, instead of through 
twenty-six letters of the alphabet; and shall cease to learn by rote, 
by trust, by faith, instead of by knowing.”

“Work and live, work and live, and all unawares the advancing 
soul has built and forged for itself a new condition.” 
PRESIDENT WHITFIELD: All of these subjects are related and I 
would like to have them discussed as soon as the papers are read. I 
have found one of the greatest defects in our education is the lack of 
sense knowledge. We learn by association. Three-fourths of the 
things people get out of books are not applicable to life. 
Two of our speakers for this afternoon are absent, and we shall 
have ample time to discuss these important questions. The absen- 
tees are Dr. M. M. Sparks, President of the Georgia Normal and In- 
dustral School, Milledgeville, Georgia, who was to have read a paper 
on “What a State College Should Teach the Girls of the South,” and 
the Hon. D. F. Giles, County Superintendent of Public Schools, 
Marion, North Carolina, who was to have spoken on “The County 
Unified to Public Education.”’ Iam very sorry we shall not have the 
opportunity of hearing these addresses. 
I introduce with pleasure my neighbor from Birmingham, Prof. 
Roy L. Dimmitt, Director of the Department of Industrial Education 
of Birmingham, Alabama.   OuR OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRIAL EDU- 
CATION. 
ROY L. DIMMITT. 
A survey of the bulletins from the Educational Departments of 
the several States comprising the Southern Educational Association 
fills us with pride when we note the liberal manner in which provisions 
have been made for the pursuit of the learned professions. Every 
State has ample provisions in her educational institutuons for the 
preparation of Law, Medicine, Engineering, Agriculture, and the like. 
This is expected of our universities and colleges, and we applaud any 
action which will tend to increase the efficiency of our professional 
schools. We would not be worthy the trust put in us as educators 
if we did not meet the obligation and provide opportunity for our 
youth who wish to become doctors, lawyers, engineers and mem- 
bers of other professions. The advance of civilization depends upon 
the manner in which we meet the obligation to provide higher educa- 
tion. 
But there is another obligation which we cannot well overlook 
with a clear conscience, but which has had very little consideration 
from us up to the present time. This obligation will suggest itself 
from a little incident which Mr. Miles tells us happened in the Denver
-P-A-G-E-177
JOURNAL OF PROCBEDINGS. 177 
Juvenile Court. A school teacher, accompanied by an unruly boy, 
approached Judge Lindsay with this question: “Judge, why don’t 
you send this boy to the reform school so he can learn a trade?” To 
which Judge Lindsay replied, ‘“Why don’t you school people make 
such provisions that a boy can get industrial education without going 
to a reform school?” 
We public school men do not seem to fully realize that we are guilty 
of neglect in this respect. How much easier it is to maintain that it 
is not the function of the public schools to provide trade education, 
than it is to conscientiously look at the problem in the light of twen- 
tieth century demands, and seek a solution for it—a solution like 
Germany has sought. A parallel case would be for the university 
authorities to hold that they had done their duty by providing for the 
A. B. degree along the old-time lines without consideration of the pro- 
fessional courses. But we find the universities, in addition to the 
A. B. degree, offering courses in Journalism, Insurance, Salesmanship, 
Dentistry, Pharmacy, Teaching, Law, Medicine and other practical 
lines. ‘The executives of our higher educational institutions have 
sensed this obligation to deal with life’s practical problems and are 
striving to meet it. The universities deal in the sphere of problems 
which require secondary education for a foundation, and we in 
secondary education have not done our part by merely furnishing 
this foundation. We should also deal with some of the practical 
problems in our sphere. There are many in this sphere. Statistics 
show that fifty per cent of the pupils are out of school and into some- 
thing else at the end of the sixth grade. For example, to be an 
efficient plumber, it is not necessary to complete the high school aca- 
demic course. He would no doubt be a better plumber if he had this 
foundation, but a census of the plumbers in your home city will reveal 
the fact that the majority of the journeymen are not high school grad- 
uates. Just as the universities and colleges in their spheres have 
academic courses leading to the A. B. degree parallel with those in 
journalism, engineering and other professional courses, so the ele- 
mentary and secondary schools must in their spheres carry along 
parallel courses in the trades as well as strictly academic preparation 
for college entrance. The introduction of the professional courses on 
the part of the universities did not signify a cessation of the academic, 
but both are carried along in the same institutions at the same time 
as parallels. Neither does a plea for the vocational and prevoca- 
tional in our secondary and elementary schools imply to any extent 
an elimination of the academic studies. Both have their place. 
The industrial should by no means supplant the academic, but should 
12

178 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
constitute, at certain educational mile posts, other paths leading to 
shelter for those travelers, who from necessity or choice, see the im- 
possibility of their reaching the summit of the mountain by the main 
road. 
Our present system of providing only for those who continue 
straight through the academic work to the end may be likened to a 
party of travelers setting out with ample food and provisions, for a 
long and weary journey, when one by one the weaker succumb to the 
hardships and fall helpless by the wayside, and the party moves on 
carrying their provisions with them, leaving the more unfortunate to 
suffer and starve. We read in the accounts of the arctic explorations 
where, on several occasions, one of the faithful sled-dogs becomes 
exhausted and foot-sore and cannot continue the dash to the goal; 
but one of the men is left behind to feed and care for the faithful 
animal, and, if possible, to carry him by a side path to a near village 
for shelter and comfort. So much for a dog! But in our educational 
dash to the academic pole, if a son of a poor widow falls by the way, 
we march triumphantly by without even casting him a crust of bread. 
The point is, we provide the professions for those who reach the top. 
We are to as great a degree obligated to provide the trades for those 
who do not. 
To the individual student, what is, for example, the medical course? 
An insight into his life work—a method he wishes to pursue to make 
a living. Of course, the practitioner does service to others as well, 
aside from his personal gain. But he is not alone in this respect. 
The work of the machinist and that of the typist have their part in 
the benefit of the whole, and are necessary aids to the world’s progress. 
And the boys who desire to follow the trades for their life work are 
entitled to as much aid as those who choose to follow the professions. 
The favors should not all be handed out to the ones who are fortunate 
enough to get to the top of the ladder, but some consideration should 
be given to the lad whose circumstances have prevented his getting 
more than half way up. In a democracy, the grimy hands of the sons 
of toil are entitled to a bit of consideration in the distribution of com- 
mon funds gathered from the taxation of all. 
But it is sometimes claimed that the opportunity is here for all. 
Tf opportunity is neglected, whose fault is it? Let us assume, for a 
moment, that there is no poverty cutting short school life; that there 
is no difference in individual aptitudes; that all can take academic 
instruction with equal facility, and that all will take advantage of 
the opportunities offered, and in turn finish the high school, colle- 
giate and professional courses, and what have we? A nation of pro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 179 
fessional men and women. But it takes no particular line of reason- 
ing and logic to reach the conclusion that every nation—yes, every 
community—must have tradesmen as well as professional men. 
For example, it will not be denied that in this great city the printer 
fills a most important place. All education attempted or accom- 
plished depends upon the printer’s trade. If it were not for the 
printer, text-books for the elementary school, the high school and 
the law school alike, would be rather hard to find. The lawyer has 
his opportunity in institutional preparation, but the printer gets 
from the educational dispensers about the same as the farmer gives 
to his swine when he turns them into the grub-path for the winter, 
namely, “Root, hog, or die.” 
Last June at commencement time, when so many of our boys had 
completed their high school course, I took upon myself, so to speak, 
the duty of a self-appointed bureau of vocational guidance. One 
afternoon nine boys were in the office, and each had confided his 
choice of a life work which was as follows: one lawyer, one architect, 
one farmer, one printer, two doctors, a dentist, a pharmacist and one 
was undecided between being a machinist or a plumber. I tried to 
show them in turn the hardships, the pleasures, the responsibilities 
and the possibilities of their work to be, both the bright and the dark 
sides. After they had left, I endeavored to take stock of what I had 
done, and upon reflection reached this conclusion: The boys might 
have been divided into two groups—on the one side architects, 
doctors, lawyers, farmers, engineers and dentists, the so-called 
professions; on the other side, would have been machinists, 
plumbers, printers, the so-called trades. To the one side I might 
have said: “By completion of your high school course your efforts 
and your ambition will be rewarded at state expense by opportuni- 
ties offered in institutions where the departments of your choice are 
richly endowed by annual appropriations. The laboratories and 
lecture rooms have been equipped with the best that money can buy. 
Experts are paid good salaries to guide you through to professional 
proficiency with the least possible waste in both time and effort. 
Libraries, reading rooms, swimming pools and playgrounds are pro- 
vided to make more pleasurable your stay while taking advantage 
of these opportunities. Go, the tuition is free, and dormitories are 
provided which will reduce even your board bill to a minimum.” 
Turning to the other side, our system of education forces one to say: 
“We can do nothing for you. While your diligence has been as great, 
your work as efficient, and your characters as noble as your fellow 
classmates, and on every hand you have taken advantage of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
180 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
opportunities offered, still we have no further advantages to offer 
you. You will have to go to a down town shop and make an effort 
to get some mechanic to teach you his trade. You will, of course, 
have to make fires and sweep out the shop a year or two, but in be- 
tween times, acting as “flunky’’ for the other fellows, you may be 
able to pick up many valuable points relating to your trade.” Fel- 
low teachers, in a democracy should this be such? 
But it is claimed the trades can best be learned out in the actual 
trades. Yes, they can be learned in this way, but not “best.” It 
takes about three years under this plan to accomplish what could be 
readily accomplished in one year in a school where no other interest 
save instruction is involved. Likewise the lawyer or the doctor can 
get his education by reading in the offices of practitioners. But not 
“best.” In many cases the professions were learned in this way up 
to a few years ago. But we do not approve of this kind of profes- 
sional preparation in these modern times. 
Again, there is the fallacy that we cannot make work practical in 
schools. Let me say here, that if the little manufacturing plant 
around the corner, with a capital stock of less than $5,000, can make 
work practical, then the State with the resources of the whole com- 
monwealth can make work practical. Trade schools for our States 
and for our cities can be made practical, if practical men are placed 
in charge of them. So long as we continue to promote our university 
professors of Latin and Greek to the presidency of our trade, agri- 
cultural and industrial schools, we cannot expect them to be very 
practical. Take, for example, a survey of the district agricultural 
schools in our Southern States; and we find that in a great many 
instances Latin still continues to constitute the major topic of study. 
In a district agricultural school Latin is about as much out of place 
as a course in pathology of the central nervous system would be in 
the law college. The law school is a success, is practical, because it 
is managed by men who, in addition to their academic preparation, 
are trained specialists in the legal profession. The school of medi- 
cine is a success because its head is likewise trained in advanced med- 
ical practice. The industrial and trade schools to be a success, to be 
practical, must be in the hands of men who, in addition to having 
academic degrees and successful teaching experience, have had special 
training and experience in the trades and industries. Here, too, the 
academic and teaching sides are necessary, and so is the practical. 
These schools can be made practical. It is far more difficult to make 
a medical school practical than trade schools. But they do it right 
along by the use of clinic hospitals. For demonstration purposes, 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 181 
it is far more difficult to order up a case of smallpox than it is to order 
a ton of pig iron. Diphtheria, typhoid fever and tuberculosis germs 
do not respond to the telephone call as readily as do lumber, brick 
and cement. The dental colleges get satisfactory clinics to repre- 
sent the scores of different dental types year after year, not on account 
of its being an easy task, but because, face to face with obligation, 
their professional responsibility keeps them from reaching the stage 
of “We can’t, its impracticable.” 
Then, again, there is the cost argument. Trade schools, we are 
told, cost too much to maintain. Statistics show that trade schools 
cost in maintenance $150 and up per pupil per year. One of the best 
in the United States costs annually $180 per pupil. We find that the 
average cost per pupil last year in the universities, colleges and tech- 
nological schools of the South Central States was $186; for the South 
Atlantic States, $245, and for the United States, $261. And yet, we 
have no idea of closing the doors of our universities, colleges and 
technological schools on account of cost. 
I said we had paid very little attention to providing trade educa- 
tion. But practically every State provides trade training in a State 
school of a particular type. We do not, however, recommend to our 
boys and girls the entrance requirements of these schools, for this 
type is the State reform school and the penitentiary. Many cities 
have also in recent years established schools for incorrigibles, defi- 
cients and defectives, under the misnomer of vocational schools. 
The powers establishing these schools, both for the State and for the 
cities, are probably under the impression that boys of good morals 
and bright intellects do not need to know trades. These provisions 
on the part of the cities and the State, in so far as the educational 
system provides, would ultimately result in all the followers of the 
trades being either idiots or criminals. But we have need for intelli- 
gent workmen with high moral character as well. Says Raymond 
Riordon, ‘Industrial education has been a cure meted out for the 
deformed, the undesirable, the deficient. Industrial education 
should be the preventive. The cure is doubtful, the prevention is 
sure.” 
The A. and M. Colleges and technological schools of engineering 
do not meet this obligation because, first, they have a special function 
all their own; second, they require the completion of secondary 
schools for entrance; and third, they do not teach trades. The part 
time, or alternate plan of school and shop does not meet the obliga- 
tion entirely because the time taken to accomplish the work takes 
about twice as long as it would take in a school where instruction is 
the main aim. 
 
-P-A-G-E-182

And let us not be deceived in the delusion that we are meeting this 
obligation by providing for a class in cooking once a week for the 
girls and a wood shop for boys in which a few pieces of mission 
furniture are constructed. The domestic science laboratory and the 
manual training shop are as necessary in our grammar and high 
schools as any other general foundation subjects. Their value is 
by no means to be decried, and they should have a place in every 
public school. But when it comes to a preparation for one’s life work, 
they bear about the same relation to the tradesmen as elementary 
physiology does to the doctor, grammar school civics to the lawyer, 
and not as much as the high school course in physics does to the civil 
engineer. So the domestic science and manual training shops do 
not meet this obligation. 
No state, therefore, has done its duty until it has first provided 
at public expense at least one state trade school, and has, second, . 
made by legislative enactments provisions which will permit cities 
and districts to use their public funds for industrial education. 
No city of twenty thousand inhabitants and over has done its 
duty until it has, in addition to the general plan as now obtains, pro- 
vided, first, part time schools for those who while learning a trade 
need to receive some remuneration while yet in school; second, con- 
tinuation schools for those who have already become engaged in the 
trades, and who find need of additional assistance to become more 
proficient in their work and to put themselves in line for advance- 
ment; and, third, a trade school for the youth who would learn a 
trade and has the opportunity of spending his entire time in pursuit

The United States, as a nation, is the greatest democracy on earth, 
in every line, except her educational systems. We can get a few 
lessons in democracy along this line from Germany, a nation making 
no claim to democracy. Germany’s system of industrial schools, 
the result of a conscientious consideration of the rights of the working 
class, stands out in excellence above those of all other nations. And 
by thus caring for the individual, she has as a nation risen to pre- 
eminence in skilled labor and stands unrivalled in international in- 
dustrial competition. Industrial education thus considered from 
the standpoint of the individual is only justice, and from the stand- 
point of the nation is of vital economic importance. 
The United States has the greatest system of schools on earth for 
the fifty per cent of the pupils who remain to finish the straight aca- 
demic work. She probably ‘has the poorest in the world for making 
any sort of provision for the other fifty per cent who, from necessity
-P-A-G-E-183

or choice, drop out at the end of the sixth grade. Those who drop 
out are put on their own resources and drift into cursory occupations 
and “blind alley jobs.” And so, with a perfect system of fifty per 
cent of our children, and utter lack of any system at all for the other 
fifty per cent, the problem resolves itself into that of the ultimate 
social efficiency of the nation. What are we inclined to do about it? 
In conclusion, Mr. Superintendent, both city and state, you who 
have in your hands the making of school systems, may we ask, before 
the court of your conscience, in the words of the Denver school teacher, 
“Judge, why don’t you send our boys to the reform school, so they 
can have an opportunity to learn the trades?” 
PRESIDENT WHITFIELD: We have just one more entertainment 
this afternoon, a lecture on ‘The Forest and the School,” by Dr. 
Don Carlos Ellis of the Forestry Service in Washington, accompanied 
by stereopticon views, which will be given in the rear room of the 
church. Owing to the absence of two of our speakers we have time 
for a discussion of the papers which have been read before we adjourn 
for Dr. Ellis’ lecture. We have had a very interesting program and 
we want to give the fellow in the pew a chance. We are about to 
reconstruct education and we want to start right. We had first a 
talk on that wonderful system of Dr. Montessori. That good woman 
has been trying to do in psychology what we thought should be done 
but really failed to do. I think her work is very defective, but she 
is getting some definite ideas. 
I believe the defect in our education is that when the child asks 
thousands of questions of mother and school teacher he is not answered 
in the way that will introduce him to life. How shall we correct 
this defect? I think this is a good question and it would be well to 
have some good, snappy talks on it. 
Pror. HALLECK: I want to compliment whoever did the selec- 
tion of these papers this afternoon. I think they have been ex- 
tremely interesting. They were like water running down from a 
fountain, so smoothly were they presented. I should like to tell you 
of an incident which happened a short while ago, which seems to me 
to be applicable here, and which I think is worthy of our considera- 
tion. 
One of the boys who was graduated from my school said to me, 
“Professor, do you open letters not addressed to you?” “Of course 
not.” “Ido not, and yet you found a great deal of fault with me for 
not doing so. You will remember, when I was in school, there were  
-P-A-G-E-184
  184 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
two subjects addressed to me. I opened them and read them. You 
remember you found fault with me for failing in the rest, and I did; 
I failed completely. Now, Professor, those two subjects were ad- 
dressed to me and I had the idea of doing something that I could 
put my whole heart into. After leaving you I opened the same kind 
of letters, as I wanted to be educated so as to be of service. I have 
tried to serve this community. As a result I have orders on my 
books for a quarter of a million dollars, for which the public will give 
me seven thousand dollars.” 
“The public has never contributed that to me,” I said to him. 
“No, I won’t open a letter that is not addressed to me. You found 
two subjects addressed to you. One was drawing, the other was 
English.” 
He refused to open any other letters. I ought to have had more 
addressed to him. I am thankful I had as much. I am thankful 
that he has been of service to the public. I am thankful that he is 
making several times as much as his teacher. I am sorry that we 
reach only fifty per cent of our pupils. Are the fifty per cent entirely 
in the wrong and we entirely in the right? Is every plumber in the 
wrong and every teacher in the right? This question was raised on 
Thanksgiving morning. I began “The Education of the Central 
Nervous System” about ten years ago, in which I tried to say what 
these two women have said here this afternoon so magnificently and 
so much better. (Applause) 
Pror. McConatuy: When he first published that book he pre- 
sented me with a copy, an addressed copy, and somebody stole it. 
At least I loaned it to somebody and he never returned it. I told 
him that he was in the right line. He should have kept it up. 
I want to congratulate that lady who spoke on the senses. It is 
one of my hobbies. I cannot conceive of a human being acquiring 
knowledge of his environment except through his senses. Another 
thing, the impression upon the senses puts in action the associate 
fibres of the brain, and education in its physical aspect is a training 
of the brain and through the brain the muscles. They must work 
together with the muscles and the brain. 
Another thing, you hear so much in primary education of imagina- 
tion. You hear it all the time—the child’s imagination. What is 
it? You say you must cultivate the child’s imagination. What is 
it? It cannot be anything except the product of the brain, and if 
he has not any sense impression or sense notion, he cannot have any 
imagination. If he has not done anything or seen anything, or by
-P-A-G-E-185
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 185 
the use of his sense of touch discovered manipulation, he cannot 
have any imagination that is worth anything, and a lot of the so- 
called imagination is a misnomer, to my mind. My idea of imagi- 
nation is power to make an image. 
PRESIDENT WHITFIELD: How do you make an image? 
Pror. McConatuy: Through your sensations from the outside 
world. Understand me, as you grow older the suggestion will form 
an image which is a recapitulation or the fibre of the brain can make 
an image. I do not take stock in what is said of the action of the 
sub-conscious mind. 
Now, another thing about Madame Montessori, I have read her 
book as published in America with a great deal of interest. I know 
Miss Moore has told us of her education and her qualifications, and 
from what I have learned she had magnificent equipment for her 
work. The world had better pause a little before they condemn her, 
She had wonderful training. In the works of Sigler, a man who 
worked for years and years and devoted his life to the study of the 
weak, and in the study of the weak, those who were designated as 
feeble-minded, he says they are feeble-brained. When you say 
feeble-minded, ask yourselves what you mean. They are feeble- 
brained, and when you begin to develop a feeble brain you must 
begin with the sense organ in order to make that feeble brain work 
at all. Therefore any work in the line of the feeble brain through 
the sense is bound to result, as in the experiment he made, in a won- 
derful development of the patient. 
Madame Montessori is very modest. She does not claim to know 
it all; but I claim she is on the right track, not that everything she 
does is perfect or correct, but she is on the right track, and the proof 
is, if it is true, that she can take some of her more modest brains and 
develop them so that they can compare very favorably with normal 
children. She does not claim that these children are prepared to 
compete with normal children. 
Now, another thing, suppose you have a derelict child in the pub- 
lie school, where he cannot keep pace with the normal children. If 
you take him out of that school and put him in a school where you 
give him manipulation, in six months you will find that he can go back 
to his grade. How could you do it? You see that school is prepared 
to train that feeble-minded child and let him go along with the nor- 
mal children. That shows that the character of the work you give 
the derelict is the right kind. You have inspired what is in him and  
-P-A-G-E-186
  186 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
he has gone to work on that. I have had contention for twenty 
years along this line. I believe I know something about it, for I 
have experimented with little children. My idea is that unless you 
get down to the study of the brains and nervous systems, all your 
plans of education will be worthless. 
A MEMBER (name not called): Mr. Chairman, I should like to 
emphasize what Mr. Dimmitt has said of the establishment of the 
industrial schools. Our present system is very much like a hunter 
who fired his shot at the whole flock of birds in the hope that he 
might hit one, instead of taking aim at any one bird. We have more 
than 98 per cent of our people who are prepared for everything in 
general and nothing in particular. The great body of our citizen- 
ship, the boys and girls of this country, on whose shoulders is to rest 
the responsibility of life, are prepared for absolutely nothing in par- 
ticular, their education to a very great extent carrying them no far- 
ther than the fourth or fifth grade. Education, to my mind, is to 
work out the highest development of the individual. What kind of 
an education are we giving in this country, especially in our rural 
schools? In the South more than eighty per cent of our children are 
in the country. This education is obsolete and visionary and does 
not fit them for life. 
I fully and heartily endorse everything the gentleman has said on 
trade and industrial education. In this country, especially in the 
South, it is a fact that we have never rightly honored the trades and 
labor. They do not command the right dignity. Until we add this 
dignity to these trades and honor the man who works at the anvil 
and respect the woman who stays at home and faithfully and hon- 
estly does the work of her home, we shall not have a satisfactory 
system of education. The majority of our boys and girls leave school 
while they are still in the grades. We should discover their ability. 
We ought to have something in the schools that will make of them 
useful citizens. We ought to have some means of helping the raw- 
boned boy who is too big for his grade, and in his disgust in not being 
reached becomes ashamed of himself and leaves school. In my 
opinion these pupils can only be helped through proper industrial 
education. 
PRESIDENT WHITFIELD: I would like to ask a few questions. 
Has the common school suited to the South been worked out? Has 
the high school been worked out yet? Has the primary school been 
worked out? Have we gotten together and worked out material
-P-A-G-E-187
        JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 187 
which may be used in these schools? Is it not a fact that the funda-    
mental questions have not been settled in the South, and before we: 
talk about experiences and phases of school work, ought we not, as 
an association, study these different schools and provide something 
that will be somewhat of a jar to the teachers who are engaged in 
this work? My friend, Claxton, knows I have spoken of that. People 
are getting disgusted with us and are forcing us to add on these other 
things that we have been talking about this afternoon. These ques- 
tions come, Ought we to bring along all of the old and add on all of 
the new? Has that point fused? These seem to me to be the im- 
portant questions. 
Dr. P. P. CLAXTON, Washington,.D. C.: It is very kind of you 
not to tell the audience on which side you are. (Laughter.) I want 
to try to answer very briefly one or two of those questions. I take 
it for granted that in our saner moments we all realize the truth of { 
the saying of Froebel, that ‘you first begin to know when you begin | 
to do, and it is only half-education, if it stops short of application.” | 
You do not know’a thing, and a thing is not education until it is put | 
into. practical application. John Locke was writing about the senses 
and he said, “If there is one sense that educates more than any other 
it is the muscular sense.” I was talking to a man one time and he 
had a pebble in his hand. He pitched it into a little hole twenty feet 
away. He had learned to guage such distances through the devel- 
opment of his muscular sense. Until you get that reaction you cer- } 
tainly have not a basis for education. I stated to some gentlemen 
at a luncheon today that the muscle is valuable in education because | 
it is something you cannot talk to but you must do something with 
it. So it is everywhere. 
I think the old time school was pretty well worked out for the 
thing it attempted to do—educate five or ten per cent of the boys of 
the Southern States. I heard a man boast of what the boys who had 
studied in his school had afterwards done. He does not go any- 
where in the United States, South or West, that he does not find one 
of his boys a Bishop, a Governor or a Senator. His course of study 
is well mapped out; but we, who deal in public education, supported 
by the taxes of the people for the purpose of democracy in edu- 
cation, which means to give to every individual an equal chance 
with every other individual, and develop his or her own power 
to prepare himself for duties of life and make a living, to dif- 
ferentiate so that any child may get equal opportunity with any other 
child, and we must learn this, I think, know that his plan of educa-   
-P-A-G-E-188
    
    
  188 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
tion was not broad enough for all the children of the South. The 
German schools are democratic and ours are not—that is, they are 
more democratic than ours, but they are not wholly so, because those 
born of the trades are put into the trades without going out, regard- 
less of their ability, and those born of the professions are put into 
the professions without opportunity to go into the trades, where 
probably they are better adapted. But if you will make that oppor- 
tunity of passing out of the circumstances of birth or social rank 
into a trade or profession chosen by the individual because of inherent 
ability, and then follow out the German system of education insofar 
as it is democratic, we will have an ideal system of industrial educa- 
tion. I think it makes little difference whether these vocational 
schools are under one roof or under different roofs. We should use 
whichever is most convenient, just so one boy going into the school 
may have as much opportunity for the thing he can do as any other 
boy. If we will do that, and establish schools that will benefit the 
other nine-tenths of the pupils as they have worked out a school for 
the one-tenth, we will then have adapted our schools to the needs of 
all of the people. 
It was said that trade in education—industrial training—costs so 
much money. — I do not understand that it is necessary that it should. 
T have seen schools in which the cost of this part of the curriculum is 
not great. I was in a school the other day in which the superintend- 
ent showed me the cost of manual training, including printing, cab- 
inet making, ordinary manual training work, and the cost was less 
than nothing by about six dollars for each child—a clear gain of six 
dollars per child. Including the equipment and salaries of teachers, 
but not counting the deterioration of the building, it had cost be- 
tween $800.00 and $1,000.00 at the end of the year. They made 
useful things and charged regular prices in the market. They made 
the desks in the room and many devices which would be of assistance 
to them in their manual training work. They had painted the school 
house. They had done all kinds of things in the school that were 
useful. They had a model dairy connected with the school and sold 
the milk at fifty cents a gallon down in the city, and they had a small 
farm from which they sold their products to the city people, but they 
are not included in the estimate, only the things made in the shop 
were counted in making the profit. 
If we will give up the idea that education is learning to do useless 
things, and make things that have a real value, you will find that 
these vocational schools are not such an expense to the State as some 
would have us believe.
-P-A-G-E-189

The fundamental problem of education in the South is that we 
must come to the democracy of occupation. When we make up our 
minds that one thing is as good as another if they both serve society, 
then it will be easy for us to put in another education in school. If 
vocations are equally honored because they equally serve the com- 
munity, we will have the right principle of education. (Applause.) 
Adjourned to hear lecture of Dr. Ellis. 
THE FOREST AND THE SCHOOL. 
DON CARLOS ELLIS, LOUISVILLE, KY. 
If a man were to start out with the deliberate purpose of making 
himself unpopular with a body of teachers, he could probably adopt 
no surer method than to propose an addition to the school curricu- 
lum. It is already full to overflowing. Every hour of the school 
day is crammed, and neither pupil nor teacher has any too much 
leisure, if he performs all the duties expected of him. This is as it 
should be. It is a sign of efficiency that both pupil and teacher have 
a little more to do than they have time to do it in. The pressure 
causes more intensive work to be done. Another sign of the school’s 
efficiency is that everybody who has a pet theory for the betterment 
of mankind wants to try it on the school, and he confidently predicts 
dire things for the country as well as the failure of his project if the 
schools do not indelibly impress his point of view upon the rising 
generation. And yet I, seeking the indulgence of the teachers of the 
South, have the temerity to suggest that you teach forestry in your 
schools and to tell you that, unless you do, forest preservation will 
probably not become a permanent factor in our civilization, our 
forests will continue to be devastated by fire and waste, our wood- 
using industries will decline, an increasing proportion of our country 
will be laid waste year after year by erosion and floods, and the wood- 
lots upon our farms will constantly decrease in value and become less 
and less a source of profit instead of improving in both usefulness 
and value, as they would under scientific handling. 
T have now wittingly established my unpopularity but I, neverthe- 
less, have confidence in your good judgment and want to submit to 
you the claims which forestry has upon your schools and the manner 
in which the subject should be handled by them. While the school 
should scrutinize proposed innovations most carefully, that school 
shows wisdom which is constantly improving its course of studies and 
constantly readjusting it to the changing needs of the world of which 
it is a part and for which it is a preparation. The school should pre-  
-P-A-G-E-190
  190 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
pare the pupil for an efficient life in the sphere of activity in which 
he is later to move. Social efficiency may, therefore, be taken as the 
end toward which the school curriculum should strive. By social 
efficiency I mean more than the ability to earn an honest living and 
to be no hindrance to social progress. This is, so far as society is 
concerned, merely negative. By it I mean also the ability of a citi- 
zen to contribute in a positive way toward the prosperity and happi- 
ness of the community and the nation. In one word, service. Will 
the introduction of forestry contribute toward the preparation of the 
pupil for service? If so, how can the subject be handled, and how 
can the curriculum be adjusted to make room for it? I shall let my 
pictures answer these questions for you. Meanwhile let me say that 
the study of the forest should not be introduced as a separate course, 
except in connection with agriculture, of which it is a very important 
element. Elsewhere there are places actually awaiting the subject 
as parts of already established courses, and as the reorganized courses 
evolve these places will open wider. They may rather be called gaps 
than places, for without some consideration of the forest, these courses 
lack essential elements. Physical and commercial geography, bot- 
any, nature study, manual training, all are incomplete without a 
consideration, in the manner proper to each, of the forests, their uses 
and influences, their exploitation, and the methods being advanced 
for their perpetuation and saner use. 
In the few minutes which are left of this session, I wish, with the 
aid of my pictures, to throw out a few brief hints of the way in which 
the forest may be used in such courses as nature study, botany, 
geography, manual training and agriculture. 
NATURE STUDY AND BOTANY. 
To begin with the elemental, forestry furnishes to the teacher of 
nature study a wealth of material for study, classroom exercises and 
field work. Akin to the work in nature study, and as a further de- 
velpoment of it, is of course botany, and the places of forestry in these 
subjects may, therefore, be considered jointly. 
The study of the individual tree, its various forms, the identifica- 
tion of trees, and their life histories are always replete with interest. 
The study of trees may well begin by classifying them into the de- 
ciduous, of which the elm will serve as an example, and the ever- 
greens, illustrated by the spruce and pine. Another classification 
may be into the exogenuous varieties or those which grow by super- 
imposition of annual rings, into which class most North American 
species fall, and the endogenous, or inside growing tree, like the palm.
-P-A-G-E-191
   JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 191 
In elementary identification work no effort should be made to 
exhaust the distinguishing characteristics of the tree, for this will be 
found to exhaust the child’s mind also and to be utterly ineffective. 
Instead, a few striking characteristics, one or the other of which may 
always be found, should be indicated for each kind of tree. In sum- 
mer this mark will usually be the foliage, in spring often the flowers. 
In winter, however, when all the deciduous trees have lost their leaves, 
we must look to some other striking characteristics by which we may 
know our friends. In one case the characteristic feature may be the 
bark, as with the sycamore. In other instances the general shape of 
the tree, its outline. The Lombardy poplar stands tall and gaunt 
against the sky with all its branches uplifted. The pin oak, on the 
other hand, has its limbs stretched out perpendicularly from the stem. 
The characteristic is so marked that it enables the pin oak to be dis- 
tinguished readily and at a distance not only from other oaks, but 
from other families of trees, and this feature is as plainly recognized 
in any season. Another characteristic of the pin oak is the excurrent 
form, in which the main trunk reaches to the very top of the tree. 
The maple stands in striking contrast to the excurrent form and typ- 
ifies the deliquescent form, in which the trunk divides up into forks 
instead of retaining one main stem to the top. 
Few studies in plant life prove so fascinating either to the child 
or to the adult as an examination into the structure and the life his- 
tory of trees. Trees are such large plants that in studying them we 
are not compelled so often to deal with minutiae as we are in the study 
of the smaller members of the plant world. Why a tree with its 
heart eaten out by insects or fungi will go on living with only an ex- 
terior shell to sustain its life, the office performed by the spreading 
and interlacing roots of the tree in their search for food and moisture, 
how these roots after gathering the food transmit it through the inner 
bark to the leaves for digestion, and how the food material then 
descends to every part of the tree, even down to the'roots again, to 
be built into wood fibers—all these present a world of fascinating 
study. Furthermore, the tree possesses the advantage over other 
plants that is available for study at all seasons of the year, and pre- 
sents as great charm in the dead of winter as it does in the height of 
the growing season. In fact, in the winter time the forests unfolds 
many of its mysteries which in the spring and summer are entirely 
hidden by the great mass of foliage. In the fall of the year when the 
leaves have been stripped from the branches we find that the buds 
for the next season’s growth have already been formed and have been 
covered with a protective coat against the icy blasts of winter. The
-P-A-G-E-192

twigs may be brought to the classroom and there the buds dissected 
and examined, or they may be observed in the early spring when the 
sap first begins to flow and will be seen slowly to swell and burst forth 
into the season’s growth. 
After the study of structure and functions of the different parts 
of the tree, the fascinating story of reproduction may be taken up. 
Nature has invented many wonderful methods for the production, 
dissemination and growth of the seed. Some trees have their pistils 
and stamens in the same flower. Others in separate flowers on the 
same tree, and still others on different trees. The wind, the bees, 
and the birds all help in carrying the pollen for fertilization. Then 
comes the seed in endless variety of forms. The winged kinds, like 
those of the maples, the pines and the lindens were nature’s first 
flying machines. Long before the Wright or Curtis biplanes were 
heard of the maple keys, the true biplane types, were sailing grace- 
fully from the tree tops in the early spring, and the one planed pine 
seeds floated upon the breeze many autumns before the English Chan- 
nel was crossed in a monoplane of the Bleriot type. The seed of the 
linden presents still another example of air ship, for it is suspended 
from a parachute which whirls around and around on its journey 
from the branch to the soil in which it is to grow.. The tiny seeds of 
the poplars and aspens are imbedded in a fluffy cottony mass so that 
they may travel for great distances through the air, or along the sur- 
face of the ground, or even upon the surface of running streams, 
before they find a lodging place. The cottonwood tree gets its name 
from the fluffy material in which the seed is placed. Thus has nature 
provided for the scattering of seed broadcast and far away from the 
protection of the trees which produce them. There are other trees, 
however, which must protect their young seedlings under their spread- 
ing branches in order that the seedlings may not be killed by excessive 
sunlight. Such trees produce the heavier seeds, in the form of nuts, 
which usually fall directly beneath the branches of the parent tree. 
Sometimes, however, they roll far down a slope, are carried to a dis- 
tance by woodland streams, or are stolen and buried by squirrels as 
part of the surplus food supply, most of which they will never return 
to claim. But the squirrel is a forest loving animal, and though he 
may plant the seed far from the tree which bore it, it is still in the 
woods beneath the protecting branches of other trees. 
The work of the squirrel in tree production naturally brings us to 
a consideration of the animal life of the forest. The forest furnishes 
homes for all sorts of birds and mammals, and the study of forests 
in relation to animal life will prove another fascinating branch for 
observation and investigation.
-P-A-G-E-193
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 193 
But the usefulness of the forest to the animal world does not stop 
here. Its service toman affords another very wide field for nature 
study consideration. It furnishes him with lumber for his dwellings 
and his furniture. It gives him wood for fuel and for the making of 
many articles continually used in daily life. Even such common 
articles as the paper and pencil which the child uses in the class- 
room are products of the forest. The forest provides man with such 
food as nuts, and in giving homes to forest loving animals it furnishes 
him game for the increase of his food supply and for his recreation. 
The trees in our cities minister to his comfort and health in other 
ways. All summer long their foliage is consuming the carbonic acid 
gas which is given forth by our cities in such great volumes, and re- 
placing it by life-giving oxygen. They afford us weleome shade from 
the hot sun of the summer months, and make our streets more beau- 
tiful and comfortable. 
Most nature study teachers in conducting tree study begin and end 
with the consideration of the individual tree. There is another side 
of the study which opens up very engrossing lines of investigation, 
that is the life of the tree as a member of the forest community. The 
natural history of the forest is as different from that of the individual 
trees which compose it as is the story of a community of people, a 
city or a state, different from the story of the men and women who 
make it up. The relations of trees to one another in the forest are 
both helpful and harmful. The old trees shelter the young trees 
while they are getting their start in life, and the shade that is given 
causes the saplings to grow straight and tall in the effort to reach the 
sunlight. But there is always a bitter struggle for existence going 
on in the forest, a struggle as bitter as that which goes on in the ani- 
mal world. Of the many seeds produced but few germinate, and of 
many seeds that germinate fewer still ever produce seedlings. Of a 
dozen seedlings that may occupy a square yard of ground but two 
or three may be living at the end of five years, and at the end of a 
decade perhaps all but one may have had their lives crowded or 
shaded out. 
GEOGRAPHY. 
The place our forests should occupy in both commercial and 
physical geography is so important that the failure of many writers 
of text-books upon these subjects to give adequate attention to it is 
surprising. 
Lumbering is the third greatest industry of our nation and in some 
parts of our country ranks first. The South is far ahead of any other 
13

section of the country in timber production, and, besides the pine 
forests of our Southern States yield every year about $30,000,000 
worth of turpentine and rosin. The tannin extract, made from the 
bark and wood of many of our trees, the wood consumed in fuel, 
that used in paper making, for railroad ties, fence posts, mine timbers 
and telegraph and telephone poles amount to a product worth many 
millions of dollars a year. The maple sugar industry is another of 
many which derive their raw products from the forests. The pelts 
of fur-bearing animals which have their home in the forest bring in 
yearly a revenue of between fifteen and twenty million dollars. Aside 
from such industries as those which are indirectly connected with the 
forest, the industries which subsist wholly or in part upon wood give 
employment to 1,500,000 men and women every year. In the study 
of the relation of the forest to mankind as set forth in geography, the 
pupil may with profit have his attention directed to the various forest 
types in different parts of the country, and have pointed out to him 
industries which each type supports. We may start with him upon 
the coastal plain of the South Atlantic States, where, in the sandy 
well drained soil, we find the long-leaved pine abounding in great 
lumber and turpentine producing forests. As we move Westward, 
say over the state of North Carolina, and come upon the Piedmont 
Plateau, the character of the forest begins to change and we find 
many hardwoods intermingled with the pines. As we ascend still 
higher into the Appalachian Mountains hardwoods predominate 
with a large variety of species. The great hardwood industries are 
located in such regions as this. When we ascend still higher, to the 
summits of the mountains, again the character of the timber is modi- 
fied. Few hardwoods grow at the higher altitudes, but spruce and 
hemlock occupy the ground to the exclusion of almost all other species. 
With changes in latitude and altitude, in character of soil, and in 
climatic conditions, parallel changes occur in the character of the 
timber grown and a corresponding change in the industries which 
obtain their raw material from these forests. 
After crossing the Mississippi River tree growth becomes scantier 
until when we reach the plains we find it only along the water courses. 
Timber in any quantity is not found again until the Rocky Moun- 
tains are reached, but the kind of timber here differs from that which 
is found upon the mountains of the East. Yet again it corresponds 
to the nature of the land upon which it grows. In the East, conifers 
and hardwoods can be found in perhaps nearly equal proportion; 
in the West few hardwoods occur. In the East, which is an older 
and more established country, where the mountains do not reach to as
-P-A-G-E-195
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 195 
great an altitude as in the West, the uplands are covered with a dense 
tree growth to their very summits; in the West, where the country 
is geologically newer, great jagged peaks reach up many hundreds of 
feet above timber line. In Arizona and New Mexico we find a char- 
acter of timber resembling somewhat that of the Southeastern States, 
yet different in that it is suited to drier conditions. Proceeding to 
the Pacific Coast we find in California what are probably the most 
magnificent and certainly the oldest forests in the world—the big tree 
forests of the Sierras and the redwoods of the coast. If we follow the 
coast line up into Washington and Oregon we come upon still another 
change, for here the great western hemlock and Douglas fir grow in 
such profusion and abundance that in some stands of two and three 
story thicknesses the sun never penetrates to the ground. Nowhere 
in the world is more lumber produced at the present time than in 
these states of the Pacific Northwest. 
The lessons which Physical Geography should teach of the forest 
and its relations to surface formation and streamflow, and the influ- 
ences which these factors have upon human industry and the history 
of man are no less important. When the snows on the mountain tops 
melt and flow down upon the forest beneath, or when rain falls, the 
water is absorbed by what may be appropriately called the forest 
carpet, a thick mass of leaves and twigs in various stages of decom- 
position which cover the ground beneath the trees. In this vegetable 
humus the water is held as in a reservoir and is allowed to trickle 
slowly down into the mineral soil beneath, sometimes following the 
roots of trees in its course. Weeks, perhaps months, afterwards, 
perhaps when the rains have ceased to fall, this water appears again 
further down the slope in springs and streams which unite with other 
streams to form rivers upon whose constant and even flow the miller, 
the boatman, and the irrigating farmer may depend. It makes little 
difference with a river of this sort whether the season be one of drought 
or copious rain, there is always an even flow of water seeping into it 
from the hills the year round. But when careless lumbering or fire 
sweep those hillsides of their trees, then the rain and the wind and the 
sun beating down upon the bared slopes remove the forest carpet, 
if the fire has not already done so. The water will have no chance 
to sink into the hardened soil, but will fret channels down the hill- 
sides and add to the volume of the already swollen torrents bringing 
floods in their paths, with all their disastrous consequences, and after 
them the more disastrous droughts. 
Geography teaches us of the way in which the natural resources 
of the country, the formation of our land, and other physiographical 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  196 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
features control our civilization and our history. It should also teach 
us how man may in turn control his own destiny by the conservation 
of the country’s resources, the forests, streamflow, and soils. The 
erosion upon our hillsides which have been cleared of their timber, 
and the floods which sweep across our country wash into our streams 
every year an average of one billion tons of soil, and the National 
Government and the states spend millions of dollars annually in the 
vain attempt to keep out of the channels of these rivers soil which 
should never have gotten into the streams in the first place. The 
remedy is being applied at the wrong end. If we would exercise proper 
control over these conditions we would study the lessons which the 
Orient has to tell of the results of wrong methods of farming and the 
destruction of the forest upon the slopes. In China the mistake was 
made of giving the hillsides to the farm, and now throughout the entire 
northern portion of the flowery kingdom the hills are everywhere 
terraced to hold the soil in place. Timber is so scarce that houses are 
built of tiny poles and the ragged hungry children actually comb the 
hillsides for roots and saplings to burn. And in the once fertile val- 
leys the farmers are put to the extremity of erecting little mounds 
against which to catch the soil from the annual floods, and in this 
modicum of soil, literally torn from the floods, their scanty crops are 
raised. There are many thousands of acres of barren country in 
China today which less than two centuries ago were as rich and as 
heavily forested as our Appalachian Mountains now are. A century 
and a half of deforestation has left the areas stripped down to the bare 
rocks, and there are parts of our own country here in the beautiful 
Southland which are approaching this condition of desolation. There 
is food for thought in these considerations and adequate and impor- 
tant material for the student whereby he may become better prepared 
to handle the important problems dealing with the use and preserva- 
tion of the natural wealth of this country. 
The class in general geography should also know something of the 
National Forests, which occupy nearly 200,000,000 acres of mountain 
lands in the Western States and of the new National Forests which are 
now being established in New England and the Southern Appalach- 
jans. They should know that their purpose is the preservation of the 
country’s timber supply and of the industries depending upon them, 
and also the protection of the flow of streams which have their head- 
quarters in the mountains where these forests grow. They should 
know that nearly ten billion sheep, goats, cattle and horses graze upon 
the ranges within these National Forests every year, and that the 
grazing is so regulated that the ranges will not become impoverished.
-P-A-G-E-197
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 197 
They should know of the relation between these National Forests and 
the supply of water throughout the semiarid West for irrigation, 
without which thousands of acres of flourishing farm land would be 
barren deserts. 
AGRICULTURE. 
In no subject of the school curriculum, however, can forestry 
occupy a more important place than in agriculture. Three-fourths 
of the timber east of the Mississippi River is to be found within farm 
woodlots. There are very few farms which have not some timber 
growing upon them. 
There are many reasons why a certain portion of the farm should 
be devoted to a well-managed woodlot. There is land to be found 
on most farms which is not fit for cultivation or even for pasture, 
absolute forest land, which can not be used profitably for any other 
purpose than for growing timber. land where the rock is outcropping 
or where the underlying rock is very near the surface, land too steep 
for cultivation, where erosion will set in after the trees are removed. 
Of course in the wind-swept prairies of the Western States the loca- 
tion of the woodlot, which in these states is usually a planted one, 
presents different considerations from what are found in the East, 
for in the West the most important use for the trees is as shelterbelts 
for houses, animals, and fields. But in the East as well as in the 
West the woodlot is needed to supply timber for fuel, fence posts, and 
many other farm uses, and if of sufficient size and properly managed 
it may often supply wood for the market in the form of railroad ties, 
posts, poles, and lumber. While there is a strong tendency now 
apparent toward the introduction of scientific methods of agriculture 
and the consequent improvement in the fertility of the soil, the wood- 
lots upon our farms are from year to year becoming more and more 
impoverished; whereas, with proper handling their value and useful- 
ness can be made to increase by use. While the woodlot does not 
need cultivation as do yearly crops, its handling does demand some 
knowledge of scientific forestry. Without that knowledge, as wood 
is removed the value of the woodlot decreases. By the application 
of that knowledge the removal of wood may be made to enhance the 
woodlot’s value. When wood for minor uses is wanted, crooked 
trees, the trees which are occupying too much space, and trees of 
poor species, should be removed, so as to give the more valuable trees 
which are left the proper room and light they need for their best 
growth, and to provide for the reproduction of the better species. 
To attain these results, however, there is need of systematic and well- 
planned effort. One of the problems of the farmer today is that he  
-P-A-G-E-198
  198 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
cannot keep sufficient help because he is unable to offer them employ- 
ment during the winter months. Consequently his men drift to the 
cities where they can obtain employment the year round. Work upon 
the woodlot can best be done in the winter time, when there is little 
other farming work to do, and the work done if it is applied wisely 
will more than repay the expense. Some agricultural schools are now 
devoting a portion of their time to farm forestry. With three agri- 
cultural high schools near Washington the Government has been co- 
operating in working out a complete course of study and field work, 
and the results of the experiments are now being published in a new 
Farmers’ Bulletin. ‘Forestry in Agriculture,’ which will be issued 
within the next few months, and which can be obtained on applica- 
tion either to a Congressman or to the Forest Service at Washington. 
MANUAL TRAINING 
Before closing I want to say a very few words concerning the place 
which forestry should occupy in manual training. It is obvious that 
in the manual training school the woodworker should be able to 
recognize the various kinds of wood and know their physical proper- 
ties and values. He should know the various grainings and the 
methods of cutting woods to produce them. He should know what 
quarter-sawn oak is and why the graining in oak cut in this way is 
different from that found in the tangential oak. He should know 
the different properties of the hardwood and the softwood and what 
causes the difference. He should know why limbs cause knots in 
lumber, and why the tree grown in the open, or with excessive light 
around it, produces many limbs reaching down almost to the ground 
and consequently lumber full of knots, whereas the tree grown in the 
dense forest is straighter and has no limbs upon its trunk for many 
feet from the ground. The methods used in logging and lumbering 
operations, the manner of milling timber, the waste which may be 
avoided by economy both in the wood and at the mill, the saving 
caused by the using of short and odd lengths in lumber, and the utili- 
zation of what is now waste material, these and many other factors 
should be in the course of every manual training department. 
The subject of elementary forestry has already been introduced 
very widely in our schools. In a few instances the school garden 
work has been extended to include the school forestry nursery, from 
which trees are obtained for planting at the homes of the pupils, 
along the roadways, and in the school yards. The presence of trees 
can greatly benefit what might otherwise be a very dull and unin- 
teresting looking school building. It is an encouraging fact that over
-P-A-G-E-199
     JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 199 
half of the normal schools in the country are teaching forest study in 
some form, ranging all the way from elementary identification in na- 
ture work to well-established courses. 
Where introduced the subject is found to abound with interesting 
specimens to handle, tangible work to do, and places to go. The 
subject is essentially one of the out-of-doors. It brings the student 
right into the woods and fields. It puts him in intimate contact 
with real things in nature where, he can study it first hand, and it 
makes him familiar and at home with nature in her most beautiful 
forms. 
I have been able in the short space of time allotted me to give only 
suggestions on a subject which deserves a much more thorough con- 
sideration. I have but taken you to the door and bid you enter and 
investigate for yourselves. If you wish to do so, the Forest Service 
will help. It will supply you with publications. There are such 
publications available for free distribution as Forestry in Nature 
Study and A Primer of Forestry. It will lend you lantern slides 
with lecture outlines to accompany them, and it will aid in other 
ways. I hope that many of you will avail yourselves of these chances. 
Adjourned until Saturday evening. 
SATURDAY EVENING. 
8:00 Pp. M. Called to order by Present Whitfield. 
Dr. WHITFIELD: The first speaker of the evening is the Hon. 
M. P. Shawkey, State Superintendent of Education of West Virginia, 
Charleston, W. Va. I happen to know that Mr. Shawkey is one of 
the most active men we have in educational work in the entire country. 
He is very patriotic. In every good cause, he gives his best to the 
success of the work. He had devoted himself assiduously to the suc- 
cessful carrying out of the work of this Association, and we are very 
glad to have him with us, though we wish there were more to greet 
him. I take great pleasure in introducing Mr. Shawkey to this 
audience. (Applause.) 
Mr. SHAWKEY: Mr: Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen—You 
have doubtless noticed that there is no subject announced for the 
speaker. That means that the speaker had little to do with the as- 
signment. Some weeks ago, the President of this Association, I 
think, reinforced by the act of the Secretary, wrote me, asking me to
-P-A-G-E-200
  200 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
take a place upon the program. I replied that I thought we had 
other representatives in my state who should take that place. Some 
weeks later than that, I received a copy of the printed program with 
my name on it. The persistence of that man, Feagin—well, I should 
not say anything about him, since he is not here; but I was going to 
say that he is worse than a Suffragette after a new member of the 
Legislature. (Laughter.) I do not think it was fair for them to 
call on me this year, because I do not think it is right to call upon a 
candidate. Before election he has no time to prepare a paper, and 
after election, he either feels too good or too bad to do the work, too 
good, if he is elected, too bad, if he is not. But, obedience is one of 
the first of the school laws and I am here to take the place assigned 
me. Forasubject, ‘The Public School and Efficiency” will serve. 
(Mr. Shawkey here began the reading of his paper, during which 
he was frequently interrupted by laughter and applause.) 
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL AND EFFICIENCY. 
M. P. SHAWKEY. 
The present day has been popularly characterized as the age of 
steel, s-t-e-e-l the age of invention and the age of electricity. If some- 
body will now introduce it as the “age of the hammer,” he will doubt- 
less make a hit. 
Iconoclasm seems to have reached the zenith of its popularity. If 
a thing is big in this day it must be hammered into small fragments, 
if it is high it must be hammered down to the common level, and if it 
is round it must be hammered flat. We hammer the church, we ham- 
mer the government, we hammer political parties, we hammer the 
tariff, we hammer the courts, we hammer the trusts and we hammer 
the labor unions. We hammer the characters of living men and we 
hammer the wills of dead ones. I use to think that the revelation 
that there should be “a new heaven and new earth” probably meant 
that the same old hell should continue, but the present day knocker 
has annihilated that with his little hammer. (I think it especially 
appropriate to mention this fact at a season when we take our annual 
invoice of things for which we should be thankful.) 
It was hardly to be expected that in the reign of the knocker the 
biggest institution in civilization, viz., the public school, should escape 
attack, and it has not. How well it has withstood the repeated as- 
sault it is not mine to show at this point. I do desire, however, to 
take a look at the attack as well as the attacked, with a view of get- 
ting a clearer mental picture of each. Let no sardonic smile distort 
your serene countenances when I repeat to you the solemn declaration 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 201 
of the sacred knocker that our cherished American school is suffering 
from fifty fatal maladies. Of course no patient in such a condition 
could be expected to survive long, but there is no disputing the fact 
of the maladies, for the Bureau of Municipal Research of New York 
has checked up the reports and vouches for their accuracy. I shall not 
enumerate all these maladies, but suffice it to say that articles appear- 
ing in reputable magazines in this country, within the past two years, 
according to the Bureau’s report, have charged the schools with sins   
as follows: 
“Overworked pupils,’’ 
“Overtaxed teachers,” 
“Overloaded curriculum,”’ 
“Tack of concentration,” 
‘Lack of drill,” 
“Lack of discipline,” 
“Lack of symmetry,” 
“Lack of thoroughness,”’ 
“Too many classes,” 
“Too many books,’’ 
“Too many subjects,” “Too many methods,” 
“Too large classes,”’ 
“Composition insufficient,” 
“Drawing undeveloped,” 
“Nature study worthless,”’ 
“Arithmetic impractical,”’ 
“Grammar neglected,” 
“No originality,” 
“No system,” 
“No flexibility,” 
“No variety.”’ 
  and so on, ad infinitwm, all of which are pronounced fatal maladies, 
and a timely warning is issued to the people to save themselves before 
it is everlastingly too late. 
The chief joke-smith of all in the whole class of gallant knockers, 
however, is our esteemed Ladies’ Home Journal, edited by sister Bok. 
What is the use of being a knocker at all if you can’t be the biggest 
knocker of all, thought editor Bok, and so he seized the biggest ham- 
mer and brought it down on his wooden writing stand, until it thun- 
dered abroad to “our million and a half of subscribers” that the pub- 
lic school “is the most momentous failure in our American life today.” 
Of course a statement from the Ladies’ Home Journal needs no proof, 
but out of the goodness of his heart the editor volunteers to hand us a 
few good and substantial reasons for his knock. He conducted an 
“Snvestigation.” He sent out some spies to see and they saw things. 
They found the woods full of goblins, as it were. Why to be sure 
there were two boys and a girl found in high school up in New York 
who didn’t know who Cervantes was nor on what day of the month 
he was born. Likewise a boy from a Philadelphia school took a place 
in a store and it was found by actual test that he couldn’t tie up a 
package of goods anything like as quickly as the regular clerks could 
doit. Now the pertinent question is what does the merchant pay his 
taxes for, anyway, if the schools are not going to teach the boys and  
-P-A-G-E-202
  202 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. y 
girls to tie up packages, and do it quickly, so as to save money? The 
conclusion is plain. “Your schools are inefficient.’”” Such reasoning 
as that is common today. But those who have taken time to think 
the matter over carefully are not going to be stampeded by the present 
onslaught nor swept off their feet by such a specious but baseless ar- 
gument. 
Under our present social conditions it has been found necessary to 
increase the vital interest of the school and to do this the vocational 
studies have proven powerful factors. There can be no doubt that 
the present readjustment of the program which connects up with the 
avenues of life at a great many more points through the various lines 
of vocational activity is healthy and should go on till it touches every 
school in the land, yet we must not loose sight of the fact, for one minute 
that the chief business of the school never has been, is not now, and 
never will be to provide the shops with tinners, the stores with clerks, 
the home with cooks nor even the farms with farmers. The methods, 
habits, and ideals acquired in any school worthy the name, are worth 
ten times all the knowledge gained therein. A young fellow may come 
out of school knowing how to tin a roof, but unless he has acquired 
habits of industry, sobriety, thoughtfulness and progress he will not 
make much of a success of his work and he will be of little use to him- 
self or the community. The merchant who complains that the schools 
do not supply skilled clerks may find upon investigation that the 
schools are doing more toward producing merchants than they are 
toward producing lackey assistants, such as he wishes to buy. It 
is really a fine thing for the young farmer to leave the school knowing 
many of the scientific facts involved in farming, but it is a great deal 
more important, if you are estimating values, for him to go out ap- 
preciating farm life, enthusiastic over it, and possessed of studious 
habits which will lead him to acquire the information he ought to 
have in his work and insure a broader and better growth of mind and 
heart. 
You might as well attempt to produce a great artist by teaching 
him the mechanical composition -of paints, without the developed 
sense of beauty, as to produce farmers, mechanics or business men by 
teaching them how to plow, how to handle tools or how to calculate 
dividends without teaching them the virtue, which make men and 
scholars. All these things should be taught, but they must be taught 
as a means and not anend. The proper end of the educational pro- 
cess is an efficient farmer-citizen, mechanic-citizen or a banker-citi- 
zen, as the case may be, and not the efficient farmer, the efficient 
mechanic and the efficient banker, only.

The rapid development of wealth in this country is its curse as well 
as its blessing. It has magnified the value of material prosperity, 
stimulated greed and developed a strong tendency toward speculation 
and gambling. It has quickened activity in trading and promoting 
enterprises and at the same time discouraged the more honest produc- 
tivities such as farming in its various forms. The young fellow gets 
a notion that he ought to get rich, but that he cannot expect to do so 
by work. Such tendencies are ruinous, and there is no escape from 
their destructive influences unless we can create a different public 
sentiment, to do which will require the best efforts of the school as 
well as the church, the home and the civic society. 
The public schools are having their failures and their triumphs. 
They are good, bad and indifferent. On the average they are as effi- 
cient as the common things about us. A comparison with the rail- 
roads, or the factories, or the courts or the churches, will show up in 
favor of theschools. They are indeed doing all that they have been 
commissioned to do. To our impecunious critics who stand off and 
ask why they do not do so and so, I would answer that they are doing 
all that they have the opportunity to do, or in many instances, all 
they are permitted to do. That they are not now giving enough 
vocational training is not the gravest charge that may be brought 
against them. With the average home calling more and more upon 
the school to take up the training of the children of the country and 
with an annual immigration of a million foreigners, with crude, 
vicious and ignorant ideas of social duties and obligations, there is the 
most urgent demand for substantial development of the mental pow- 
ers and the moral instincts which constitute character and make up 
in the aggregate a worthy nationality. The utter abandonment of 
old time virtues induced by our national prosperity and exaggerated 
sense of liberty is cause for alarm. We hold that idleness is a curse, 
but the great majority of the youth of today toil not neither do they 
spin, but they do dissipate to a frightful degree. 
What has become of reverence for age and respect for authority? 
“What has become of parental control? What has become of the good 
old fashioned hard study? The child today is hardly expected to get 
a lesson unless perchance the teacher can lead him into it by disguising 
it as “play,” and he is not expected to use a book unless the story or 
the pictures appeal to his fancy and get his attention without any 
voluntary effort. You demand that the teacher return you a strong 
man or woman, but you deny him the power to make a serious propo- 
position of the school business. I am not praying for a return of old 
fashioned New England Puritanism in its entirety, but I am certain 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  204 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
that a thorough inoculation of the present generation with the homely 
virtues of old New England would be like supplying fresh water to a 
fainting plant. Spartan training was vigorous, but Spartan manhood 
was the most vigorous we have ever seen, and this incomparable man- 
hood was almost wholly the result of the Spartan method of training. 
It is not popular to speak favorably of Puritanic customs these days. 
To the average person a mention of Puritanism calls up pictures of 
plain food, hard work, serious faces, long Sundays, and funereal man- 
ners. Even when the good of the Puritan creed is admitted the self- 
denial required is considered too great a price by the great masses of 
our ease loving population at the present time; but when we recall 
that a large proportion of the really great statesmen of the nation, 
many of its scholars and reformers and nearly all of its poets of world- 
wide note came out of New Engalnd Puritanic homes and were edu- 
eated in the old fashioned Puritanic New England Schools, we must 
admit that the present day has no grounds for any claim of superi- 
ority. 
That good old Puritan sage, Ralph Waldo Emerson, himself living 
the life of a prophet, in a burst of enthusiasm once declared: 
“So nigh is grandeur to our dust, 
So near is God to man, 
When duty whispers low, ‘Thou must,’ 
The youth replies, ‘I can!‘ ” 
But if duty ever got near enough to the average boy on the’streets 
of the average town today to whisper anything into his ear, that youth, 
rather than to reply nobly “I can,’’ would just as likely blow a whiff 
of cigarette smoke into the face of the visiting angel and bid him go do 
it himself, grumbling, ‘I don’t have to work.” 
“T slept and dreamed that Life was beauty, 
I woke and found that Life was duty,” 
beautifully sang Ellen Sturgis Hooper, but there isa long line of girls 
tripping lightly down from our schools today who seem to be entranced 
in that dream about beauty with little hope of their awakening to a 
consciousness of the truth that revealed itself to the inspired singer 
of the song of duty. 
“Tt is wonderful what strength and boldness of purpose and en- 
ergy” declares Dr. John Foster, “will come from the feeling that we 
are in the way of duty.” 
“This span of life was lent for lofty duties, not for selfishness; not 
to be whiled away in aimless dreams, but to improve ourselves and 
serve mankind,” says another.

Standing on the deck of his flag ship before the battle of Trafalgar, 
and facing the allied forces of France and Spain, England’s idol, Lord 
Nelson, realized that the existence of the British Empire and the fate 
of Western Europe depended upon the work of his men in the next 
three hours. How could he key every man to meet the demands of 
such a critical moment? The world knows how he did it and the 
world knows the story of the victory. “England expects every man 
to do his duty!” was the sublime challenge which the gallant leader 
sent ringing into the ears of every man in the squadron. But the 
average school forgets that appeal today. Instead of a summons to 
duty, the teacher proposes to ‘play’ some history, arithmetic or 
geography, or she promises indulgence, exemption from examina- 
tions or a half day off, or she promises a reward, a privilege or an im- 
munity or a “fudge party.” But the teacher is little to blame. If 
she is not an adroit in the game of “‘flim-flamming”’ her pupils in some 
such way she will lose her place, for the average American parent will 
not stand for compulsion in handling his darling Dolly or Johnnie, 
any more than he will stand for a sermon, more than twenty nimutes 
in length. What a blessing it would be if the whole community of 
parents could just realize that it is their duty to send their children to 
school on time, every day, and for the full year’s course. What a 
blessing it would be if those dear youngsters could be taught first the 
virtue of obedience, then the value of work, then self-application, then 
the great Emersonian law of compensation. Then why not provide 
school buildings that afford an opportunity to do a lot of the good 
things that are demanded by the exacting public? And then would 
it be unreasonable to ask that you pay the teacher, that general, that 
leader, that moulder of character and destiny, a little more than $40.00 
per month? 
Yes, we need increased efficiency in the generations now leaving 
our schools, but there is more need for the Abe Lincoln type of effi- 
ciency, men who have learned to “scorn passing delights and live 
laborious days,” men who love duty and know the value of purpose, 
than there is for the man who has been trained vocationally so thor- 
oughly that he will fit into a cog in the great industrial machine and 
go on revolving there till his old frame is worn out and he is ready to 
return to his native dust another witness that life is only eating, drink- 
ing, sleeping. 
I would like to see more of that type of efficiency that will enable 
a boy to pass a moving picture show with five cents in his pocket. 
With our vocational training or with our literary training, we must 
not forget the vision. The young man coming to the end of his

course of training is fortunate if he has caught something of the spirit 
of Dr. Van Dyke: 
“Let me but do my work from day to day, 
In field or forest, at desk or loom, 
In roaming market place or tranquil room, 
When vagrant wishes beckon me astray, 
Let me but find it in my heart to say: 
‘This is my work, my blessing, not my doom, 
Of all who live, I am the one by whom 
This work can best be done in the right way. 299

THE COUNCIL MEETING OF 'THE SOUTHERN HDUCA- 
TIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
3:00 p. m. Novempnr 28rn, 1912. 
The meeting was called to order by Dr. J. H. Phillips of Birming- 
ham, Alabama, Council President, who presided during the meet- 
ing, at 3:00 P.M. 
Presipent Puinuirs: Ladies and Gentlemen—The gathering 
this afternoon is promising compared with the Houston meeting, 
when, I believe, there were three representatives of the Council pres- 
ent. We then, however, reorganized, passed resolutions and held 
our formal election of officers. 
The Southern Educational Council was organized several years 
ago with a definite purpose in view. Possibly in that tentative or- 
ganization, the gentlemen who instigated the movement had in view 
the work of the national council in connection with the National 
Association. The conditions of the Southern Educational’ Asso- 
ciation, however, were very different. At that time, nine years 
ago, our membership was very uncertain and very much scattered. 
The Treasury of the Association was depleted, and the organization 
was permitted to languish. 
I have prepared a brief statement of the plan proposed for the 
work of the Council. 
PURPOSE AND FUNCTION OF THE EDUCATIONAL COUNCIL, BY J. H. 
PHILLIPS, SUPT. OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS, BIRMINGHAM, ALA. 
The Southern Educational Council was organized at the Atlanta 
meeting of the Association in December, 1903. The suggestion of 
the organization came from our present United States Commis- 
sioner of Education, who was elected its first President. The aims 
and purposes of the Council were briefly outlined by Dr. Claxton 
at the annual meeeting of the Board of Directors, and there was 
a general consensus of opinion that the reasons submitted were 
valid, and amply justified the organization of the Council, with 
the idea of making it the leading and most vital department of the 
Southern Educational Association. 
The Board of Directors, at that meeting, felt confident that the 
field of work and the patriotic interest of the teachers of the South
-P-A-G-E-208
  208 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
justified an effort to strengthen the Association by making its mem- 
bership permanent and continuous, as had been the case for many 
years with the majority of the membership of the National Edu- 
cation Association. It had become evident that so long as the main- 
tenance of the Association was limited to those in attendance at 
any given meeting, the funds in the treasury would be correspond- 
ingly limited, and would be insufficient to meet the growing needs 
of the Association. It was further evident that so long as the 
active and sustaining membership changed from year to year, there 
could be no continuous interest, and the work of the Association 
must remain disconnected and haphazard. To justify the expec- 
tation of systematic work, projected through a series of years, there 
must be a continuity of interest based upon continuity of mem- 
bership, and through such continuous membership, an increase in 
the annual receipts. These are essential to any extension of work 
on the part of the Association. 
Accordingly, the Board of Directors adopted plans, and gave in- 
structions to its executive officers, looking to the establishment of 
the Association upon a more substantial basis. With the expecta- 
tion that these plans would be realized, the Council was organized 
for the purpose of undertaking the new lines of work that would 
thus be made possible. 
Unfortunately, the officers of the Association failed to realize 
the expectations of the Board of Directors. The plan for estab- 
lishing permanent and continuous active memberships came to 
naught as a result, there was no continuous interest except by a 
few members, in the work and welfare of the Association. The re- 
ceipts of the Association from year to year scarcely sufficed to pay 
the indebtedness incurred, until at the Chattanooga meeting two 
years ago, it was discovered that the Association was heavily in 
debt. A change in the secretaryship and administrative methods 
made by the Board of Directors at that meeting inaugurated a 
new regime, which was more definitely formulated at the Houston 
meeting last year, and which now promises to realize the vision of 
the Board of Directors at the Atlanta meeting nine years ago. 
Naturally, under these conditions, the Council has languished 
and has accomplished little more than to keep intact the semblance 
of an organization. The change in administration, the removal of 
an embarrassing deficit, and the promising strides already made in 
securing permanent membership and continuous interest, have now 
restored the Council to the place it occupied nine years ago, when 
it was organized at the Atlanta meeting.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 209 
The immediate purpose in the minds of the founders of the Coun- 
cil, was, first of all, to gather into one body, representative men and 
women from the several fields of educational work in the South. 
This body of representative educators, it was thought, could with 
advantage discuss various lines of educational work and could, in 
an advisory capacity, serve to direct and promote the general 
policies of the Association. 
No effort was made at the time of the inauguration of the Coun- 
cil to formally outline its purposes and methods of operation. It 
was wisely thought by the founders that its work and methods 
would develop in time, and would be largely determined by con- 
ditions. In a general way, however, the following aims and pur- 
poses were considered with favor: 
1. It had become a noteworthy fact that in the Southern States, 
a number of organizations had sprung into existence. Some of 
these were of a general educational nature, some were restricted to 
the promotion of one specific line, such as the Kindergarten, Music, 
Art, Public Libraries, Rural Schools, Industrial Education or Pre- 
paratory Training for College; others were organized for the pro- 
motion of economic movements and were only incidentally edu- 
cational. Each of these organizations was duplicating the work 
of other organizations, and each was endeavoring to cover the ter- 
ritory and to do the work already undertaken by the Southern Ed- 
ucational Association. The teachers of the South are already 
burdened and embarrassed by the number and diversity of the edu- 
cational associations they are expected to attend. In consequence 
of the long distance most of them must travel, and the great ex- 
pense incurred, it is necessary to reduce the number of such asso- 
ciations. 
The unification or codrdination of these several organizations 
was, therefore, considered a proper aim for the Council. The need 
of the concentration of energies and resources now dissipated 
through divergent plans and agencies, is still so obvious as to re- 
quire little comment or discussion. 
2. It was also contemplated that the Council could be of service 
to the Association by determining the special fields of investiga- 
tion for which committees might be appointed. The Council of 
the National Education Association for several years had given ef- 
fective service by the appointment of special committees to investi- 
gate and report upon specified topics. The great reports of the As- 
sociation, like the Report of the Committee of Ten, and the Re- 
14 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  
  210 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
port of the Committee of Twelve, published under the auspices of 
the National Council, became authoritative educational classics. 
The South has a number of problems, educational, economic and 
sociological, that need just that kind of scientific investigation and 
discussion. The Southern Educational Association is the only or- 
ganization now existing under whose auspices such investigations 
could be conducted, and even then, it would be useless to expect 
from the general Association a scientific investigation and a calm 
and deliberate discusion of these problems such as the conditions 
demand. Such investigations and reports should be in the hands 
of a comparatively small and compact body of men, representing 
the larger body. The selection of the fields of investigation; the 
appointment of expert scientific educators and economists to con- 
duct the investigations and to formulate their reports; and the 
appropriation of the funds necessary to defray the expenses inci- 
dentally incurred, are matters that might be legitimately placed 
in the hands of the Council. 
Requests by other departments for appropriations to be applied 
to the conduct of special investigations, should be submitted to 
the Council for consideration and approval before they are sub- 
mitted to the Board of Directors for final action. And, when such 
reports are prepared by any of the departments of the Association, 
they should be submitted to the Council for discussion and ap- 
proval, prior to their publication, bearing the imprint and author- 
ity of the Association. 
3. One of the special functions that might well be delegated to 
the Council should be the “Annual Report of Progress.” 
In the past, much of the time of the Association, or of some of 
its departments, has been occupied in listening to a dozen or more 
unrelated and disjointed reports from as many states. Each State 
Superintendent is expected to give in five or ten minutes, the sa- 
lient lines of progress in his state during the year, and each is 
naturally interested in making his report as interesting ‘to his 
shearers and as favorable to his constituents as the conditions will 
permit. There is no effort made to digest and correlate these re- 
ports, and their real value to the general Association is questionable. 
If all these reports are submitted in advance to a standing com- 
mittee of the Council, this committee could select the vital .ele- 
ments in each report, and present to the Association an annual 
summary of educational progress that would be valuable asa well- 
digested and authoritative compound of the actual educational 
development of the Southern States during the year.
-P-A-G-E-211
    JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. . 211 
A similar report by still another committee might be given re- 
garding foreign educational movements. Such reports would prove 
of value to the entire membership of the Asociation and to the 
country at large. 
4, The preparation of the educational platform of the Associa- 
tion has usually been relegated to, or assumed by, the Committee 
on Resolutions. This committee is generally announced by the 
President at the opening of each annual meeting. Such a com- 
mittee may find it a simple matter to prepare appropriate resolu- 
tions, but no committee is so well equipped that it can find suffi- 
cient time during the meeting to prepare an adequate statement 
of the educational principles for which the Association should 
stand. A standing committee of the Council should make its re- 
port first to that body, and with the approval of the Council, this 
platform of principles should be submitted for adoption to the 
general Association at its final session. 
5. It has also been suggested that the Council should have an ad- 
visory committee on program. The actual program maker of the 
Association is changed each year. This is doubtless as it should be. 
New themes and new viewpoints are thus brought before the mem- 
bership. On the other hand, it is urged that a standing advisory 
committee of the Council could prove very helpful to the President 
of the Association. Such a committee by its larger outlook upon 
the field, its wider knowledge of men and movements, and its long 
continued experience in the work of the Association, could suggest 
vital topics for discussion, and could also suggest as speakers on 
the program men who have something worth while to say upon the 
themes assigned. Such a plan would have a tendency to give con- 
sistency and coherency to the program, and would supplement the 
energy and enthusiasm of a new President with the wisdom and 
experience of the advisory standing committee. 
The foregoing are some of the purposes and functions of the 
Council, as contemplated by those interested in its organization 
as a department of the Association. If the Southern Educational 
Association becomes firmly established, as we hope it will, this 
Council, as a department, should make itself effective in the life 
of the Association. It should no longer remain a dormant factor, 
without any specific function or duty. I am conscious of the fact 
that this brief statement of the purposes and aims of the Council 
is incomplete, but the actual possibilities of this department can 
not be foreseen until it begins to show some symptoms of life.

DISCUSSION. 
Hon. M. L. Brirrarn, State Superintendent, Atlanta, Ga.: Mr. 
Chairman, Gentlemen—We have before us one problem that we 
must solve, and in my opinion the Southern Educational Associa- 
tion is better fitted to take charge of this work than any other or- 
ganization—and this is the race problem. We should develop the 
negro schools. We should provide for better supervision of these 
schools. I will read you a short paper giving my views. 
Purpose aNp Funcrion or SourHERN Epucationat CouNciL. 
M. L. BRITTAIN. 
Through inadvertence, I am sure, I have not been furnished with 
the address of the President and, of course, suffer from this dis- 
advantage. In the discussion emphasis is laid on the purpose and 
function of the Council. In an assembly such as the Southern Ed- 
ucational Asociation one of the dangers always apparent is the 
lack of cohesion, due to the very formation and constituency of 
the body. Meeting as we do, so rarely and for so short a time, there 
is considerable likelihood that each session will be a sort of law 
unto itself, and the thread of continuity will be lacking. This 
danger, it seems to me, is obvious. A small body of veteran mem- 
bers, therefore, could be of great service to the Association in aid- 
ing it to proceed with some definiteness of aim. It seems to me, 
then, that the leading purpose of such a body as the Southern Edu- 
cational Council would be to map out the program of work and 
submit it to the Association. It might, perhaps, be urged that this 
would interfere with the President and Executive Committee in the 
preparation of the regular program. It can hardly be doubted, 
however, that these gentlemen would receive the suggestions made 
as a favor, and would be relieved thereby of a considerable burden. 
Not only so, but in my judgment it is fairer to the Association to 
have these programs suggested and perhaps even outlined by a 
body of men coming from all sections of the South. 
The peculiar conditions which are found in the Southern States 
seem to make it advisable for us to have an educational assemblage 
of our own. The same argument holds true with regard to the 
Council. We have our own difficulties different from those of other 
sections, and they are too familiar to us to be enumerated here. 
Of course, the greatest of these is the bi-racial school problem, 
which is ever present with us. The many difficulties of all kinds 
eall for the combined tact and wisdom of us all. It would not be a
-P-A-G-E-213

very happy thing if the Association were to have, for instance, a . 
President who would insist upon bringing into prominence the 
more radical views and theories concerning the negro and his edu- 
cation at any of the sessions. This is a danger which the combined 
wisdom of the Council could more readily check and meet than if 
it were left to one man. Many other difficulties might be specified, 
but this will perhaps illustrate sufficiently what is meant. 
The National Council of Education through long years of its 
honorable career as part of the National Education Association 
has demonstrated the value of the tenth legion or old-guard idea 
in this large Association. Several selected from each state within 
our borders—some by the votes of a self-perpetuating body and 
others annually by the Association itself—it seems to me, would 
add strength and vitality to our work. There is a certain danger 
attached. It is hard to keep such an organization free from a cer- 
tain taint of Pharisaism and aristocracy, which has never been 
popular from the days of the Doges and their oligarchs down to 
the Conway Cabal. It ought to be possible to avoid this, however, 
with the real function ready to hand for a Council of earnest men, 
intent upon doing honest service for the Southern Educational As- 
sociation. 
Dr. Junius Jorpan, Pine Bluff, Ark.: Mr. Chairman, Gentle- 
men—I fully agree with Dr. Phillips’ ideas as expressed in his paper. 
I am not a member of the Council. I am here by courtesy. I can 
not discuss this subject from a broad point of view—only from per- 
senal experiences. Now when you present subjects to a council 
of education, who are to determine the steps for the progress and 
development of educational interests of the country, it is highly to 
be desired that they be passed upon by those who have the power 
and experience to judge. 
Now, you take the question of the racial problem. That is largely 
a local one. In Arkansas, we spend more money on our negro 
schools, in proportion to the white, than any other state in the 
Union. The negro pays one-sixteenth of the taxes, and gets the 
benefit of the taxation of the other fifteen-sixteenths of the other 
race. We _ spend over $30,000 a year in normal schools for the 
black race. We have two or three hundred there in that normal 
school. They get the advantage of our appropriation. They are 
learning industrial work of various kinds, and they are getting 
along very well. We have no trouble. There is no educational 
problem, as far as the negro is concerned, in our state. They get 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  214 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
their legitimate share of the appropriation. There is less friction 
in the state of Arkansas than in any other state in the Union. We 
have solved that problem ourselves, advantageously to both races. 
We have four colored schools in our town. I visit these colored 
schools once or twice a week, and I meet these colored teachers. I 
see their plans of operation, their plans of presentation of their 
subject, and you would be surprised to see and know how far they 
have progressed along the lines of educational development; but 
nevertheless while this is true in our section, it may not be true 
in other sections. Therefore, there is need for the Council to in- 
vestigate, so that Legislatures can enact the necessary laws gov- 
erning these problems. 
We have all agreed on the industrial proposition. We have all 
agreed that they should all have their pro rata for advancing their 
educational interests. Now, what else can we do? We must try 
to arouse the proper sentiment in regard to education. We want 
everything that emanates from this Council to reach every Southern 
States and produce harmony as well as progress in educational de- 
velopment. I hope the teachers in this Association will study 
these problems in reference to the national as well as local condi- 
tions, and I hope this committee, which is called the Council, will 
study out these facts and get upon some uniform basis upon which 
we can all agree and move forward, and that we will help each 
other along. 
“Help each one his cross to bear, 
Let each a friendly aid afford, 
And share a brother’s care.” (Applause.) 
Supr. M. A. Cassipy, Lewington, Ky.: Our friend Dr. Brittain 
says that care should be exercised in the selection of the plan of 
action of such a Council as this. In this I think he is entirely 
correct. The Council, in my opinon, should be advisory entirely. 
It should not arrogate to itself any line of action that should not 
be endorsed by the Association itself. I believe that it should be 
the duty of such a Council as this to originate, to formulate and 
to work out problems to be presented to the Association for its 
ratification. Such action as this would not appear in any way ar- 
bitrary, but in meeting with the endorsement of the general As- 
sociation would be much better than otherwise. Among other 
things, that it should be the duty of such a Council to discuss, to 
investigate and to take action upon is the question of teachers’ 
salaries. That is a question that would relate itself to every
-P-A-G-E-215
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 215 
teacher in the South. It is well known that teachers are not paid 
in proportion to the amount of the service which they render. I 
suppose there is no class of workers who receive poorer compensa- 
tion for great labor than do the teachers of the Southland. This 
problem was partially discussed at the Houston meeting, and also 
other questions peculiar to the South—vocational education, the 
education of the Southern girl, the negro’s education, the educa- 
tion of factory children. One of the most interesting of these dis- 
cussions was the one on the education of the Southern negro, by 
your President. He suggested that the Southern Educatonal Coun- 
cil take up that question at the Houston meeting, and formulate 
some plan by which this great need may be emphasized to the peo- 
ple of the South, but nothing was done there. I think these ques- 
tions are so important, so vital to the very existence of the South 
that this Council at this meeting should formulate some plan of 
action and put it into execution during the coming year. If we 
will do this, we can rest assured that our existence is not in vain— 
if we can accomplish something. If we cannot accomplish some- 
thing, there is no reason whatever for our existence. 
Mr. Joun R. Kirk, President State Normal School, Kirksville, 
Mo.: Mr. Chairman—I am not prepared to participate in this dis- 
cusion. I take great pleasure in attending the meetings of the 
Southern Educational Association occasionally, and hearing what 
you are doing. It is true that the state of Missouri is much of the 
time classified as a Southern State, but the conditions in Missouri 
are not the same as a true state in the South. The negro question 
is not of any great consequence in the state of Missouri; but it has 
always seemed to me the greatest question, from every point of 
view, in the true South, and that we of the Middle West and the 
West and the North have no concrete experience whereby we can 
judge of the enormous difficulties which you have here—conditions 
which, of course, all of the country helped to produce. 
I cannot help thinking that the suggestion of your Chairman 
points in the right direction, but unless we carry out our plans, 
we are like the army that “marched up the hill and then marched 
down again.” In so far as I can understand the situation, I agree 
with the Superintendent from Atlanta. Take, for example, your 
negro school question in any state. Perhaps it is just as bad in 
the state of Missouri, but it is less consequential because of the 
relatively small number of negroes. I have yet to see in any vil- 
lage, or in St. Louis or Kansas City, the negro school in which I  
-P-A-G-E-216
  216 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
thought the problems given were such as they ought to be to appeal 
to the previous experience of the person sought to be taught. The 
literature taught in the negro schools in Kansas City purports 
to be the same taught the most cultured white people who spend 
their summers with their children in the mountains or at the water- 
ing resorts, or in Europe. Now, everybody knows that there is a 
misfit, an abnormality, that ought not to exist in my state to the 
extent that it does exist, and so far as I have been able to learn, 
that sort of education has been going on, with perhaps a few excep- 
tions, in all of the states. I could cite many such examples. 
Ladies and gentlemen, you not only have an opportunity here in 
your beautiful association of Southern teachers to solve some prob- 
lems for the country at large, but you certainly have concrete prob- 
lems in your curriculum that reach into the lives of the people. 
Most of the National Educational Association committee reports, 
in my state, are impractical and visionary. We are always solving 
problems of legislation, and the real educational problems are not 
being given much consideration. Excepting in certain cases where 
certain geniuses, such as Jesse Field in Iowa, is working, educa- 
tion is not advancing. We rush around the country reading re- 
ports of committees, theorizing on generalities, but doing nothing 
in the concrete. 
There was one great report made, and it was written mainly by 
women, and it dealt with the concrete teaching of history. For 
several years it remained on file, but now it is beginning to be 
used. They are doing away with war history and are teaching 
the social and industrial history, because this is something that 
the children can appreciate and get some good out of it. I think, 
Mr. Chairman, I have rambled quite a good deal, but you are cer- 
tainly striking out in the direction that is essentially desirable 
to go. 
Supr. L. E. Wore, Memphis, Tenn.: I want to agree with the 
great speech of Dr. Kirk. I should think it would be helpful if 
we could find just what is being done in the different cities in 
the South in regard to a number of things in the colored schools; 
for instance, what supervision they have. In Memphis, Tennessee, 
my assistant and I visit the colored schools just as often as we do 
the white. It is a question whether this is done everywhere. 
Some one has said that the colored people are satisfied. Well, a 
few years ago they had learned to be meek. The Southern people 
can get along with the negroes all right. Negroes were satisfied
-P-A-G-E-217
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 217 
years ago when sewing was not taught in their normal schools. A 
year ago we put sewing into their schools. They are better satis- 
fied. They were satisfied without music. We put that in and they 
are better satisfied. In districting the schools we frequently have 
some of the negroes who have to go much farther to school than 
others. This is a hard problem. They are satisfied, perhaps, but 
they would be better satisfied if we did something for those who 
have to go two miles to school. It is impossible where negroes are 
so scattered to give them the same advantages as we give the whites. 
There is one problem that I think is peculiar to the South, and 
that is school gardening. We have better opportunities for school 
gardening in the South than they have in the North. If this 
subject were given the attention it deserves, school and home gar- 
dening would be almost universal. It succeeds nicely. I tried it 
for fifteen years in San Antonio, Texas. We had two thousand boys 
with home gardens, but it only rains there occasionally. In Mem- 
phis we have as much rain ag you have here in Kentucky. We are 
instituting a system of school and home gardening there. We are 
getting ready so that with the opening of next February we will 
have school and home gardens that will count. We have already 
secured sites from a half acre to an acre, in nearly all of our thirty 
schools. For the past two months the city has been fertilizing 
them from their stables. They are being plowed. We are getting 
ready for successful school gardening next spring. In the mean- 
time, every parent in the city has been communicated with by cir- 
cular letter, appealing to them to assist their boys in making little 
spots ready, clear it, plow or spade it. I spoke to those boys, 
asking them to get a little garden ready to do something with it 
next spring. 
This work is not only peculiar to the South. I know in Minne- 
sota, and also in the cities of Cleveland, St. Paul, etc., they have 
done great work; but we have an opportunity to do a greater work. 
We have problems that are peculair to us which are not found in 
other parts of the country, and these we must solve. 
Dr. Junius Jorpan, Pine Bluff, Ark.: We are omitting from 
our program the topic of the overcrowded curriculum. Every year 
something new is to be crowded into the course of study in our 
grade and high schools. I think we should take into consideration 
what we should eliminate. The grade school teachers are worked 
to death. Only the other day I saw a cartoon in the paper criti- 
cizing this. It was the picture of a little girl with about eighteen 
books in one hand and a tiny package of lunch in the other.

Dr H. L. Warrrinrtp: I was very much impressed by what Mr. 
Kirk said in regard to concrete education. When I was elected 
President, I wanted to try to bring out the humblest folks. [ 
searched the South and I tried to find people who were perform- 
ing the definite work of the South—the great fundamental things. 
We are still in the talking stage. I have been a State Superin- 
tendent and made reports, and that is the reason his paper hit me 
hard. But, in my opinion, if we follow these reports we can have 
the best schools in the world; but we have had a lot ot reports that 
were pure and unadulterated lying. (Laughter.) We have been 
trying to show the wonderful work done in this country. 
There is a whole lot in what you say about the curriculum. When 
you go out to the rural schools, you will find them just about the 
same as they were twenty years ago. We all say we must connect 
the child with life, and yet we give him books filled with abstract 
knowledge, unrelated to anything around them or anywhere. We 
simply have them memorizing formule. They go away from school 
more ignorant than they would have been had they remained at 
home and had to do work around the home. The old field school 
is eulogized, but behind it was the old field home. There being no 
stores where the boys could buy ax handles and simple farming 
implements, etc., he had to use his own ingenuity to fashion them 
for himself. 
Everything in the South today educationally is chaotic. Fifteen 
years ago it dawned upon the educators that the old disciplinary 
education is false. We all know now that the purpose of education 
is to train the individual for social efficiency, and yet these prob- 
lems have not been worked out. Everything has been done in an 
unscientific way. We have been adding new cloth on to an old gar- 
ment until now we cannot make a thread hold. z 
Now, I'll tell you what we need, and there, to my mind, is the 
need of the Association. I believe in working on the negro prob- 
lem. He is here, and we will be false to the trust if we do not; 
but we need to work out the white problem. When we get salvation 
for ourselves we will do better for the negro. I believe we should 
collect all of the world’s information on educational problems and 
adjust it to our conditions here. Why, I think we ought to have 
a committee at work seeing what the common school ought to be; 
how much of it is dead weight, that we could and ought to take out 
of the schools, instead of just adding on. Let us just work it over 
and over again in a scientific way until we work it out. 
In some states they have two kinds of high schools, industria! 
and agricultural high schools. Now, what will be the result of
-P-A-G-E-219

this? It will cause two classes of society made from the educa- 
tional system. We ought not to have that. We have heard fine 
papers, now let us do something. When are we going to make life 
more endurable for the people? I had to give up my work because 
I did not succeed in finding concrete work. Let us do something. 
Let us give the other fellow something to stand on. We will then 
educate public sentiment and bring salvation to the people. I 
thank you. 
Hon. Joon W. Asercrompis, Member of Congress from Ala- 
bama: I did not have the pleasure of hearing Dr. Phillips’ paper, but 
I am sure it was good. He neyer writes any other kind. I have en- 
joyed the discussion. I believe that this Council has a great work to 
perform. If there is any reason for the existence of the Southern 
Educational Association, that reason lies in the fact that this section 
is confronted by an educational problem that is peculiar to the sec- 
tion, and I believe the reason the Association has not measured up 
to our expectations in the past lies in the fact that we have not 
given sufficient consideration to that problem. We have state or- 
ganizations and national organizations, and in my opinion this As- 
sociation, and especially this Council, will make a mistake if it 
should continue to confine itself to the consideration of general 
problems which these other associations are working on. 
Our educational problem grows out of the fact that we have two 
very dissimilar races occupying the same soil. It is a racial prob- 
lem. What is the race problem in the South? To teach two very 
dissimilar races to live upon the same soil in harmony and mutual 
helpfulness, to develop a race within a race, to establish a civiliza- 
tion within a civilization. That, I think, is the problem of the races 
as it confronts us. We have shut our eyes to the fact that we are 
confronted with this great problem. We have turned the negro 
over to himself and to outside influences, and for more than a gen- 
eration he has been drifting away from us. 
Who knows what the negro is thinking about, how he lives, 
what is taught him in his schools, what is preached from his pul- 
pit, what he talks about in his secret societies? I do not, yet I 
was reared here. You do not. Gentlemen, we have neglected this 
problem too long, and this body ought to appoint committees to 
investigate that feature of the work of the Association. 
Upon motion of Mr. Whitfield, a committee of five members was 
appointed to formulate a plan for the work of the Council and to

Procress or SUPERVISION IN THE Sours.

Fellow Superintendents, Ladies and Gentlemen: I deem it a great 
privilege and honor indeed to be called to preside over the delibera- 
tions of this department of this Association. To preside over the 
deliberations of the superintendents of the South. is, indeed, a great 
honor, because, first, there is no section of our country in which so 
much progress has been made in educational affairs in recent years 
as in the South; secondly, because State Superintendents, County 
Superintendents and City Superintendents have been the leaders of
-P-A-G-E-224
  224 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
educational thought and progress. There is no class of people today 
standing on the watch-towers of educational advancement that are 
more alert, active and energetic than the superintendents of the 
different departments of educational work. ‘Therefore, as I stand 
before you this afternoon, I realize that I am speaking to the leaders 
in the great educational progress that has been made in the South. 
Recently I addressed a letter to all the State Superintendents 
and leading City Superintendents of the South asking them to 
summarize for me the educational progress that had been made in 
their respective school systems during the past year. The majority 
of these responded quite readily; some have neglected to do so. 
But a sufficient number of them did respond to enable us to get 
quite a complete survey of the advancement which we have made 
during the past year. One of the striking features of these reports 
as they have come to me from the different sections of the South has 
been the uniformity of ideals, aims and purposes, which character- 
ize the work of our superintendents. I attribute this to a number 
of causes. Among these I would mention the alertness and progres- 
siveness of the superintendents of our section; another is the pub- 
licity that is given to every attempt at progress in educational work. 
Other agencies that help to unify the ideals and aims of superin- 
tendents in school work are educational associations, central bu- 
reaus of information, such as the Russell Sage Foundation and 
the activities of the National Bureau of Education under the direc- 
tion of our own Dr. P. P. Claxton; but I should fail to give honor 
to whom it is due if in this connection I did not say that this unity 
of purpose and progress in school affairs in the South is largely 
due to the alertness and eager desire of our superintendents to ren- 
der to their respective school systems the largest service possible 
and to make the work of the schools conform to the needs of the 
people in their respective communities. 
State Legislatures were in session in only a few states of the 
South during the past year; but wherever they were in session, 
we find that very sane and salutary laws on educational matters 
were passed. We find that a number of states have passed laws 
providing for the consolidation of schools and the transportation of 
pupils. In many instances acts were passed which have for their 
purposé the lengthening of the school term in rural schools, and 
in some states, we find already, the average school term is now prac- 
tically 140 days. We find also that many of the states have pro- 
vided for the establishment of county high schools in which shall 
be taught the principles of agriculture, dairying, animal hus-
-P-A-G-E-225
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 225 
bandry, domestic science and arts, etc., which have for their pur- 
pose the preparation of boys and girls of the rural communities 
to live more efficient and serviceable lives in their respective com- 
munities. These high schools which have been establishd through- 
out the South are already influencing the life of the people. There 
is also a tendency in every state to remove the schools as far as pos- 
sible from political influence and intrigue. This is clearly shown in 
the recent law on state textbook adoption in the State of Texas. 
This law indicates that every safeguard possible has been thrown 
around it to protect those who are to put the law in operation from 
improper influences. The more that this can be done and the fur- 
ther schools and school people are removed from the influences of 
politics and politicians, the more professional our schools and our 
school men and women will become. 
Every superintendent realizes that one of the great defects in 
our systems of schools in the South is in adequate supervision. We 
realize that more money has been wasted on our school system in 
the past because they have not been properly supervised than pos- 
sibly from any other one cause. Realizing that, we believe Ken- 
tucky during the past year has passed such legislation with re- 
spect to the problem of supervision of her schools as will not only 
be a great financial saving of educational moneys and will give to 
her children much more adequate instruction, but also puts her in 
the front rank of educational progress and advancement. The law 
which authorizes the State Superintendent to act as State Inspector 
and Examiner of all schools in cities, towns and communities re- 
ceiving funds from the state, which provides for two special As- 
sistant Inspectors and which provides for the employment of coun- 
ty supervisors of rural schools, is one of the most desirable pieces 
of legislation that has yet come to my attention from any state in 
the South. We find a tendency in the different states to provide 
more satisfactory compulsory attendance laws, also that the stand- 
ard for teachers is being raised, and corresponding to this we find 
more adequate compensation for teachers. In the past no section 
of our country has provided more generously for the education of 
her childhood, to be paid directly out of her state treasury than 
have the states of the South. And yet our school funds have been 
entirely inadequate to the needs because of lack of local taxation 
for school purposes. But the states of the South are becoming 
aroused on this point and are providing for local taxation for school 
purposes more and more each year. So far as I know, no state has 
equaled the state of Arkansas, where during the past year her peo- 
15 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
  226 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ple raised by local taxation the sum of $17.75 per capita for each 
child in actual attendance in the public schools. It is right that 
the state should provide for the education of its childhood in order 
to prepare for its citizenship. It is also right that the local com- 
munity shall assist in providing adequate educational opportunities 
for their children in order that they may be prepared to carry on 
the institutional life of the community in a more efficient and capa- 
ble manner than they are carrying it on today. 
We find that legislation has been enacted which provides for such 
standards of efficiency and better compensation as will place the 
office of County Superintendent in the South on a professional 
basis and such as will give local schools more expert and adequate 
supervision. 
When we review the work of the city superintendents of the 
schools of the South, we find that a majority of them are con- 
fronted with the same general problems and that they are endeav- 
oring to solve these in very much the same way. We shall review 
here some of the more important problems that have claimed the 
attention of superintendents during the past year and the ones to 
which they have devoted themselves conscientiously. 
Superintendents of city systems of schools are realizing more and 
more the value of expert supervision. We find that the school sys- 
tems of the South are adding from time to time to their teaching 
force expert supervisors of different subjects. Superintendents 
have realized the necessity of giving more systematic and uniform 
instruction in penmanship, and our schools are readily being sup- 
plied with supervisors of this subject. Likewise and for the same 
reason, supervisors of drawing and music are employed. Possibly 
no movement has attracted a wider attention and obtained a greater 
momentum in educational affairs in recent years than that of phys- 
ical culture. Educational leaders now realize that the child may 
recapitulate many of the racial experiences through play, and thus 
may his play activities becomes educative in character. ‘Therefore, 
a supervisor of this subject is being employed by the progressive 
school systems of the South. We are realizing today that the en- 
tire child is coming to school, not merely the eyes and ears. We 
realize also that the demand of the present day upon the schools 
is not merely to turn out hearers and thinkers, but that those who 
are educated in the schools may be able to do. We know that the 
highest mark of development in man is the hand, that the hand is 
possibly the crowning member of man’s body, that in the hand the 
sense of touch is specialized, and through it we may awake the in-
-P-A-G-E-227

tellectual powers of the mind as we can in no other way. There- 
fore, we are providing in our schools systematic courses in manual 
training not only to prepare the child for some definite remunera- 
tive occupation, but in order that we may enlarge his intellectual 
activities as well. 
We now realize that there is no calling or occupation to which 
humankind is called that equals that of motherhood. The efficiency 
and well-being of mankind is largely dependent upon its mother- 
hood. The stability of the state and the nation is founded upon 
the home life of its people. Therefore, it is essentially necessary 
that our girls receive such instruction as will prepare them for 
these important duties. For that reason our schools are providing 
adequate courses in domestic science and arts. 
Another problem to which superintendents are turning their at- 
tention is the conservation of childhood. We have come to realize 
that many backward, retarded and delinquent children are such 
because of some social or physical defect, a large part of which may 
be overcome. But inasmuch as there is to be a paper on this par- 
ticular subject to be presented at this time, I shall not discuss this 
point further. 
Other activities of city superintendents are such as school gar- 
dens, mothers’ clubs, the school as a social center, properly organ- 
ized and supervised athletics, proper training for teachers in service, 
etc. These are some of the problems that confront the modern 
city superintendent and to which he is zealously applying himself 
in order that he may find a proper solution of the same. Yet there 
are other problems to which I would like to call your attention. 
One is a simple and uniform system of reports that should be 
adopted by every city superintendent in the South. Another is a 
system of records that will contain complete information about 
pupils enrolled in school that are kept systematically and uniformly. 
Another problem is economy and efficiency in the administration of 
school affairs. 
But the ‘one problem above all others demanding our solution 
today is to determine the educational value of each subject taught 
in our schools and what each subject contributes to the education of 
the child. There is more ignorance on the part of school men about 
this one subject than possibly any other one confronting us today. 
There is more time wasted, more haphazard teaching done on ac- 
count of ignorance of this one subject than any other thing that I 
know. The physician knows the medicinal value of his prescrip- 
tions. How much more should the teacher who administers to the
-P-A-G-E-228

intellectual ills of the child, whose duty it is to impart life and 
more abundant life, know the value of the subjects that she teaches 
and what each contributes to the intellectual development of the 
child! I therefore call upon the members of this department to 
devote themselves ardently to the solution of this problem in order 
that our school systems may render a larger and more beneficent 
service to mankind. 
Fifty years ago the South lay prostrate, impoverished and in 
ashes. Her homes were destroyed; her wealth gone; her rich, royal 
blood spilled; her sterling young manhood dead; impoverished in 
all these, yet rich in zeal and determination, she began the rebuild- 
ing of her homes; the replenishing of her race; the retrieving of 
her lost fortunes; and in this condition the education of her child- 
hood. Fifty years behind her sister states on the North in edu- 
cational affairs, she started in this race, but during the half century 
that has intervened she has caught step with the line of progress 
in educational affairs in this country, and today she is in the front 
rank of the procession and is aiding and leading in every move- 
ment that has had for its purpose the progress of educational ad- 
vancement in this country. Let each of us acquit ourselves like 
men, and may it be our chief ambition to contribute the largest 
service possible to this, the greatest work to which mankind is 
called.

The public schools have been essentially conservative. Courses of 
study, methods of teaching and of administration have been largely 
shaped by traditions and by practice current in the schools of the 
cities and states supposed to have the best schools. Imitation and 
habit have played leading roles in the struggle of the public school 
for system and uniformity. When attempts at change have been 
made, they have been directed to a large extent by the opinions of 
prominent educators. These opinions are seldom the result of a 
scientific study of facts. 
The state establishes and supports the public schools for its own 
preservation and advancement. The state demands that the school 
fashion the children and youth into citizens. The school must 
strive to make the individual conform to the standard of citizen- 
ship held by the state. Parents send their children to school to be

    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 229 
taught that which is socially approved, and naturally object to 
having their children experimented upon. Due to these and other 
kindred influences, the schools have followed the “beaten tracks.” 
The school superintendent has been largely concerned in attaining 
and maintaining predetermined standards and in preventing varia- 
tions. He has been laboring to bring pupils up to grade, teachers 
up to standard, and his schools up to the approved ideal for cities 
having the best schools. In this environment and historic setting 
it is but natural that few superintendents attempt anything orig- 
inal in the problem studies and research. 
The program of work of a city superintendent of schools is heavy. 
The duties and responsibilities of his office and the demands from 
without made by the communities consume his time and energy. 
His mind is dissipated by many and at times petty practical prob- 
lems. Habits of study are broken, and opportunities for research 
are denied him. Knowing well the magnitude of the burden on 
superintendents, I still advocate the addition of this new or more 
recent duty of research and problem study. 
Some activities are life-giving, and some added burdens make the 
bearer stranger for his task. Nothing which a superintendent can 
do will react upon his own mind toward keeping it alive and effi- 
ciently active more than research studies into educational problems. 
These studies usually require the assistance of all his principals 
and teachers, and in this way and through the report issued con- 
taining the completed study the teachers and principals are stimu- 
lated and interested. 
We need more than dogma and opinion to guide in our endeay- 
ors for improvement in our schools. We need to have facts—classi- 
fied facts, adequate facts. From these facts inductions and deduc- 
tions need to be drawn and tested by further practice. 
The land is full of critics of our system of education. Destruc- 
tive criticisms are common and are given wide publicity. A recent 
popular journal contains a leading article under the tile “The Pub- 
lic Schools a Failure.” Many of the statements in this article were 
erroneous, due to incorrect and insufficient data and faulty infer- 
ences. These critics should be met by the facts set forth in such 
a way as to convey the truth and be plain to the lay mind. Studies 
on retardation and elimination haye revealed only a partial truth, 
and fallacies are spread broadcast. 
The recent studies and researches have opened up the field and 
shown the value and need for such studies and reports. There is 
now a pressing need for more information of scientific character

and form in regard to a host of school problems. Superintendents 
should \join with universities, the Bureau of Education of the 
United States, and special foundations for research in a study of 
school problems and, where possible, make independent researches. 
The superintendent has a great opportunity for research. He is a 
man of authority, and can call to his assistance all his teachers 
and all the machinery of his administrative office. The burden of 
research is nearly always great, but the superintendent is in a posi- 
tion to distribute this burden among so many that no one will be 
required to do much. The graduate department of the university 
is often dependent on reports which exhibit conditions two or 
more years in the past; the superintendent can be supplied with the 
fresh facts and the live data of present conditions. Well-directed 
and clearly reported researches powerfully stimulate interest in the 
schools and thus serve,a most useful purpose in advancing the inter- 
ests of education. Viewed from almost any angle, one is forced to 
the position that superintendents should participate in formal re- 
search and educational problem study. 
Superintendents should repeat for their cities, studies which have 
been made in other communities. Conditions vary; and while such 
repetitions may not mark the superintendent as original, yet they 
are of value and may have the advantage of being easy. Not only 
should, the superintendent, repeat the researches, but he should en- 
courage his principals to repeat for their individual schools some 
experiment reported on from other cities or by some university. 
In the second place, superintendents should join in coéperative 
studies conducted by some foundation, bureau or university. This 
method is less difficult than original research directed by the super- 
intendent, and yet is of the highest value; for through this co- 
operative research more stable and wider norms may be established. 
Such a codperative study was conducted a little more than a year 
ago by the Russell Sage Foundation, represented by Dr. Leonard 
Ayres. In this study of age and progress of pupils some twenty- 
nine superintendents in as many cities participated. 
In the past two years in New Orleans the department of super- 
intendence has made or caused to be made studies on the follow- 
ing problems: 
Elimination and Retardation. 
Promotion and Non-promotions of Pupils. 
Relation between the Work and Pay of Janitors. 
Reasoning in Arithmetic. 
Mechanical Operations in Arithmetic. 
Distribution of Class Marks for High School Pupils.

At this time the problem of the exceptional child is our theme for 
study. In, making this study, the School Board of New Orleans, 
through the Department of Superintendence, is coéperating with 
the Board of Administrators of Tulane University, represented by 
the Departments of Psychology, Education and Hygiene. This plan 
of coéperative work is unique and somewhat pretentious. I know 
of no other such codperation in just the same way. 
After some preliminary conferences and discussions. between the 
Superintendent of Schools of New Orleans and Professor David 
Spence Hill, of the Department of Psychology and Education in 
Tulane University, the following proposition was agreed upon by 
the School Board and by the Board of Administrators of Tulane 
University : 
Resolwed, That the sum of $1,500 per year be appropriated from the New- 
comb Fund, for the purpose of codperating with the Board of Education of 
the city schools, under the following specifications : 
1. That the Board of Education shall contribute an equal amount, pay- 
able October 1st of each year while the agreement is in force. 
2. Tulane agrees to make examinations of cases of exceptional children 
brought to us from the schools. 
3. Tulane agrees to use for these purposes the psychological laboratory 
of Newcomb, its furniture and apparatus and the necessary services of special- 
ists from the faculty at Newcomb and other departments. 
4, Tulane agrees to make other scientific investigations upon request of 
the superintendent. 
5. Tulane will provide instruction for prospective teachers of exceptional 
children, 
6. The Professor of Psychology is to nominate to the President and have 
immediate direction of the work of the Assistant Professor of Experimental 
and Clinical Psychology, who is to devote most of his time to the investigation. 
7. This agreement may be terminated at the expiration of any academic 
year, at the option of either party; but notice of same shall be given at least 
three months beforehand. 
Since the opening of the schools in September, the classes for the 
training of teachers for exceptional children have been operating 
with an attendance of — teachers in these classes. A course in Edu- 
cational Hygiene has been given three days each week to the one 
hundred and twenty young ladies in the senior class in the City 
Normal School. This course is given by Professors Hill, Fletcher 
and Wellman, of the University. 
All the preliminary work. for the study of children has been com- 
pleted and the first part of the study undertaken two weeks ago: 
As a part of the plan, I have been authorized by the Board of Edu- 
   
-P-A-G-E-232

         cation to establish four classes in as many different parts of the 
city for instruction of certain of these exceptional children. 
We do not expect to solve the problem of the education of every 
exceptional child, but we do expect to make a careful and scien- 
tific study of the problem and to stimulate and direct interest in 
that problem. 
We shall first make a census of exceptional children in all the 
public schools of the city. After this census is completed, certain 
children reported in the census, with the consent of their parents, 
and with the approval of the superintendent, will be sent to the 
Psychological Laboratory of Newcomb College in Tulane Univer- 
sity, for examination. This examination will be conducted in part 
by a physician, by a psychologist and by a social worker. The ex- 
amination will look toward a recommendation for the treatment 
of the child in the regular classrooms or in special schools. 
For making the preliminary census, a blank form was printed 
and distributed to the teachers. Hach teacher, with the assistance 
of the principal, filled in all the facts for her grade. The principal 
tabulated on a special blank for principals the reports from teach- 
ers. Those blanks will all be sent to the Newcomb College for 
further tabulation and study. 
The classes of children were as follows: 
Class A.—Feeble-minded or insane children who should be under institu- 
tional or home care, rather than in the public schools. 
Class B.—Backward children (not in Class A) or those who urgently 
need special educational methods in special classes within the public schools. 
Class C.—Exceptionally able or gifted children. 
Class D.—Incorrigible, habitually vicious children: 
(a) Who seem to be defective mentally. 
(b) Who seem to be of normal mentality. 
Class E.—Children of apparently good intelligence, but obviously suffering 
from some serious physical defect, temporarily or permanently unfitting them 
for the work of the grades: 
(1) Defective vision. 
(2) Deaf and semi-deaf. 
(3) Suffering from speech defects. 
(4) Crippled children. 
(5) Epileptic. 
Classes A, B and C are intellectual distinctions. Class D is moral and 
Class E is physical. 
All the exceptional children, boys and girls, white and colored, 
from kindergarten to the eighth grade, inclusive, were reported in 
these various classes.
-P-A-G-E-233
    JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 233 
These reports were returned to me by the principals less than a 
week ago, so at this time I am unable to report the compiled facts 
for the city. For your information, I give the facts for two typical 
schools, (a) and (b) and for a third school (c), which is one of the 
poorest. 
School (a) has an enrollment of 721 pupils. Of this number, 
there is 1 feeble-minded, 172 backward, 4 exceptionally gifted, no 
incorrigible children, 6 with defective vision, 7 defective in hear- 
ing, 4 defective in speech and 2 crippled. 
School (b) has an enrollment of 866. Of this number, none are 
reported, as feeble-minded, 51 are backward, 21 are exceptionally 
able, none incorrigible, 6 have defective vision, 8 have defective 
hearing, 7 have speech defects, and 1 is crippled. 
School (c) has an enrollment of 272. Of these, there are 8 
reported as feeble-minded, 14 as backward, none exceptionally able, 
8 incorrigible of defective mentality and 6 incorrigible of normal 
mentality, 5 defective in vision, 1 deaf, 17 with speech defects, 4 
crippled and 1 epileptic. 
As a part of the Annual Report of the Superintendent for 1912-13, 
a full account of the study will be published. 
During the year we hope to make one or two other studies. One 
other is now partially under way, to be under the immediate di- 
rection of Dr. Edmund Moss, Chief Medical Inspector of the Pub- 
lic Schools, and Dr. Hill, of the University. 
The object of these studies and the use of the scientific method 
is to establish standards for measuring our educational processes 
and products. Opinion, oratory, traditions and speculations must 
be replaced by evidence, logic, facts and definite terms. Leonard 
Ayres, in his Harvard address recently, said: “‘How much and 
‘How many’ and ‘With what results’ are going to displace guess- 
work, imagination and oratory as criteria for shaping educational 
policies. The old method has been education within the cloister in 
which an educational peep-hole has been cut to satisfy the parent 
and silent tax-payer. The new method proposes education in the 
open and under the light of the clear and penetrating rays of the 
search light.” 
It would be an interesting and valuable number on the program 
of this department if each year a number of superintendents re- 
ported in brief outline the plans used and the conclusions reached 
in researches made in their schools. 
Norn.—Upon request of a number of superintendents the blank 
form used in making the census is appended.

Function or THe SUPERINTENDENT IN RESEARCH AND 
EpucaTionaL StTupins. 
EDWIN 8S. MONROE, MUSKOGEE, OKLA. 
The duties of the superintendent of schools are manifold. He is 
expected to function in many and various ways. Without mention- 
ing any others of the multiplicity of the phases of his work, the 
subject of this discussion assigns to the superintendent a place on 
the very important feature of educational advancement, that of as- 
sisting and, promoting research and study of educational problems. 
In, the very nature of the situation the superintendent is, because 
of his office and position, in possession of the most valuable means 
in making observations and in gathering educational data. His 
field is at once a library, a laboratory and a clinic. He has at his 
command all the necessary apparatus and material for making his 
investigations and performing his experiments. His system of 
schools,is organized to the end of carrying out his. ideas and plans. 
He.has a corps of trained assistants who. respond. freely to his. re- 
quests and who follow intelligently his. directions. Whatever ex- 
pense may be involved in his investigations is willingly paid by the 
board of education he is serving. Every school building with its 
hundreds of children coming from all sorts of homes, from, the. best 
to the poorest, is his laboratory. His. organization of working 
forces. gives him immediate and intimate touch with any phase of 
educational, study to which he may turn his. attention. Nor is his 
opportunity. limited. to the. schoolroom, His. position in the com- 
munity affords him the key for opening the door of investiga- 
tion into the social, civic and economic conditions of the city in 
which he lives. He is, therefore, able to follow any thread of re- 
search into whatever intricate skein of life or condition it may 
lead, He will find, not only the principals and teachers ready to 
obey him in collecting his data, but the ministers, club leaders, 
social workers and others engaged in whatever phases of. educa- 
tional work will be glad to codperate and lend assistance. In the 
superintendent of schools, more than in any other individual in the, 
community, therefore, lies the potentiality for entering into re- 
search of educational questions, gathering and testing data, and 
formulating conclusions in educational studies. 
With this wealth of materials and opportunities at his. command 
it is no wonder that he is often called upon to furnish information 
of various kinds to many and sundry individuals. Scarcely a 
week passes by that the mail does not bring him requests for spe- 
   
-P-A-G-E-236
  236 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
cific information or questionaires to be answered touching many 
phases of educational work. Some fellow superintendent may want 
data relative to some educational matter in which he is interested 
for a report he desires to make to his school board touching a plan 
he wishes to be adopted in his system, or, perchance he is seeking 
material for a paper or an address he has in preparation for some 
educational meeting or association. Some college professor may 
submit to him a list of questions asking specific information and 
statistics, especially requesting his opinion or ideas concerning cer- 
tain matters, which opinions and ideas afterward are incorporated 
into a thesis for an advanced degree, or for a contribution to edu- 
cational literature. Some college student may likewise ask him to 
furnish the foundation material for a report or paper in his edu- 
cational course. Some association, society, foundation or some- 
thing of that kind, may seek information in some subject under 
investigation and may request him to gather statistics, make experi- 
ments, offer suggestions, express opinions, test out conclusions and 
submit observations in a lengthy report. Some periodical or maga- 
zine editor may desire reports on this or that phase of education 
which will corroborate or refute some pet theories advocated or as- 
sailed in the editorial columns. Some publisher or business firm 
may want certain matters investigated which will aid in the exten- 
sion of their business or help to put on the market some book or 
piece of apparatus. In fact, the superintendent of schools seems 
to be the easy mark for all sorts of requests, some legitimate, some 
otherwise, for information which his position gives to him as to no 
other individual. 
As examples of the requests that come to the average superin- 
tendent, I have only to recount those which have found way to my 
desk within the last month. I was asked by the publisher of a 
widely used dictionary to interview a number of our most cultured 
and reliable citizens and make an authoritative statement as to 
the correct spelling and pronounciation of the name of the city in 
which I live—whether it was the general custom among educated 
people to spell it M-u-s-c-o-g-e-e or M-u-s-k-o-g-e-e, and further, in the 
pronunciation, if the “g” is hard as in “give,” or soft as in “gin,” 
and whether the accent should be given on the first syllable or on 
the second. This information was wanted to be incorporated in the 
revised edition of the dictionary which is soon to appear. I made 
the investigation and forwarded my report, and presume from now 
henceforth Muskogee will be spelled and pronounced as the educated 
people of my rapidly growing and progressive city would have it
-P-A-G-E-237
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 237 
spelled and pronounced. The editor of a leading woman’s maga- 
zine a short time ago asked me to investigate the operation of the 
Oklahoma law which requires the county commissioners to pay to a 
needy widowed mother the wages of a son who is required to attend 
school through the enforcement of the compulsory education law. 
I made the report, and suppose that in the near future the result 
of my investigation will be the basis of an enlightening article on 
the subject in that magazine. Under date of November 20th, the 
publishers of another leading woman’s periodical, which, by the 
way, has not been very complimentary to the public schools of the 
country, requested me, through the Division of Commercial Re- 
search of that periodical, to make a more or less extended report 
on the teaching of sewing in our schools and its relation to the mer- 
chandising of textiles, sale of dress patterns, etc. The publishers 
of a popular encyclopedia have also requested a verification of sta- 
tistics as to manufacturing, street improvements, building, etc., in 
my city. 
Our own State University, through its School of Education, 
asked, a few days ago, for answers to some twenty-five or thirty 
questions relative to the teaching of morals in our schools. All the 
questions required more or less investigation. The General Com- 
mittee of the National Education Association on Teachers’ Sala- 
ries, of which Dr. Joseph Swain, of Swathmore College, is Chair- 
man, recently sent in a request relative to investigation into the cost 
of living and teachers’ salaries in my city. A professor in an agri- 
cultural college desired me to report on the value of school gar- 
dens in reference to their correlation with the other work of the 
schools, as language, art, etc. A committee from a Northern state 
desired a report on the uniform textbook law and its satisfactory 
or unsatisfactory operation in my city. Another college man who 
is making special study of vocational education asked for a report 
on a little experiment we are trying out in Muskogee in the mat- 
ter of vocational work done outside of the high school for which 
we give credit toward graduation from the high school. A com- 
mittee from a Ministers’ Association desired an investigation into 
the extent of the knowledge of our high school pupils as to the 
Bible. A number of questions were enclosed with the request that 
they be submitted to the pupils in the form of an examination, the 
papers graded and the results sent to the Association. Two per- 
sons requested data to be used in debates on educational subjects, 
and two members of the women’s clubs asked for reports on the 
value of certain subjects and methods of. instruction in our schools.
-P-A-G-E-238
  238 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
And so it goes. The superintendent is called upon for information 
on a multitude of matters. His help is sought in various quarters 
because of the peculiar position he holds which enables him to se- 
cure and to give correct information. Nor should the superin- 
tendent resent these requests. They come ofttimes when he is busy 
with his duties and perplexed with his problems. But he owes it 
to his profession, he owes it to the children under his supervision, to 
answer patiently and accurately all questions which are funda- 
mental in the formation of correct educational theories and attitude 
of the people. The people must be enlightened in regard to mat- 
ters relating to all phases of public education. The data must be 
correct, or false conclusions will be drawn. The desire for truth 
should at all times be uppermost, and no theory, tending in what- 
ever direction it may, can result in harm which is based on ‘true ‘and 
full investigation. 
How, then, is the superintendent to conduct his investigation 
and research? He should proceed very much as the scientist ‘or 
any other expert does in the investigation of his problems. He 
should put into operation the apparatus he has at hand on the 
material that is before him. His manipulation must be patient 
and accurate, and his observation must be clear and correct. He 
can put into action all the machinery of his system of schools in 
gathering data from which to form conclusions. Many questions 
may be answered by simple reference to statistical reports which 
are always at hand and kept up-to-date. Bulletins may be issued 
and special reports required in order to answer other questions. 
Meetings of principals or of special teachers may be necessary to 
secure data for still other questions. The superintendent may even 
earry on his investigation in the schoolrooms themselves, making 
personal observations. He can study first-hand the output of his 
schools by means of written or oral tests, and he may direct face- 
to-face the teachers in his required investigations. He can check 
and counter-check in the elimination of error. He can test out his 
own conclusions by comparison with those of trusted and sympa- 
thetic subordinates. He can submit his reports for verification to 
those who have secured for him the data from which he has arrived 
at his solution. In fact, the superintendent possesses peculiar 
power which should enable him to carry on effectively investiga- 
tion and research into educational subjects. 
The function of the superintendent in tesearch and educational 
studies, therefore, should be to gather data accurately and fully, 
experiment carefully and completely, test out truthfully and thor-
-P-A-G-E-239

oughly in all matters affecting the public schools. His judgment, 
more than that of any other, should obtain in passing on theories 
touching public education, for the very exigencies of his office puts 
him in position to know and to know that he knows.

Vital geography is geography that deals definitely with human 
well-being, in the form of food, clothing, shelter, transportation, 
and the means for the transmission of intelligence. Then a vital 
course in geography would trace the finished products through the 
series of industrial processes back to the raw material and the 
natural resources; to soil, heat, moisture, and the minerals in the 
mine, the forests, stream, waterfall, and wind and ocean current; 
back of the soil to the processes of weathering, transportation and 
deposit; back of the moisture in the form of rain to the clouds, 
and the mountains that have wrung the moisture from the clouds, 
and to the winds that have hied the clouds from the distant seas 
where they have drunk their fill; back of heat as a condition of 
agriculture to the heat zones and the seasons, and to the revolution 
of the earth in its orbit and the inclination of its axis. 
For illustration, such a course would trace bread back through 
the industrial processes of baking, making, grinding, threshing, 
reaping, cultivation, to soil, heat and moisture. 
Such a vital course of study would not only trace the finished 
product back to the natural resources and forces, but would trace 
historically the essential industrial processes from their primitive 
beginnings to their present high state of perfection. For illus- 
tration, it would trace ginning, spinning, weaving, sewing and dye- 
ing; mining, smelting, forging and casting, from their simple be- 
ginnings to the present time, when the few now employed in each 
industry can produce more finished products than could all the 
workers of the world by the old process. The comparatively few 
now engaged in spinning and weaving can produce more cloth than 
could all the workers of the civilized world by the old process, if 
they did nothing but spin and weave. 
With the ever-increasing recognition that man is here to pos- 
sess the earth and to conquer it fully to his well-being, and the 
further recognition, in family, church, school and state, that hav- 
ing conquered the earth, it is man’s duty to share the means for hu- 
man welfare with his brother around the earth, the present unin- 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
240 SOUTHERN BDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
teresting textbooks on geography dealing largely with location and 
boundary can not longer satisfy the demands of the present civili- 
zation. 
The time must come when these textbooks will be superseded by 
a half dozen or more stimulating books dealing vitally and con- 
eretely with man’s commercial, industrial and economic conquest 
of his physical and social environment. 
However, until that time comes, the practical problem is to learn 
how to vitalize the textbooks on geography that are now in the 
schools. What I shall suggest is available in a greater or less de- 
gree for any teacher in any grade. It is as follows: 
Mountains are vital in wringing moisture from the clouds, in 
their picturesque beauty, as a depository for the mineral wealth 
of the world, as barriers to commerce. A pupil can be made to real- 
ize the extent to which mountains are barriers to commerce by 
describing the Herculean engineering feats of tunneling the Hoo- 
sac Mountains or the Alps; by supposing a second Rocky Mountains 
extending across the Mississippi Valley from east to west. Moun- 
tain passes are vital in that they are our commercial highways. 
Who shall estimate the value of the passes in the Appalachian and 
Rocky Mountains to commerce between the two seaboards? Val- 
leys are vital in that they have robbed the mountains of their soil 
and have become the granaries of the world. Oceans are vital be- 
cause they furnish a free roadbed to the ports of the world. The 
wind and ocean currents lay hold upon the vessels and carry them 
to their destination. A harbor, as usually taught, is but a location. 
Taught vitally, it is a place where vessels can not only safely land, 
but ride safe at anchor waiting to take on a cargo or to discharge 
it. It will give a pupil an idea of the vital side of a harbor to ex- 
plain to him how many ten thousands of miles of coast line there are 
where, because of the shelving beach, a vessel would be grounded 
long before it reached the shore; and if the water should be of 
sufficient depth to permit of its reaching the shore, it would have 
no protection from wave and storm. 
The vital thing in our Great Lakes is that they constitute the 
greatest inland waterway of the world; that more than half a cen- 
tury of engineering has given a twenty-foot channel around the 
Rapids of St. Mary’s, on the St. Clare Flats, and at the Lime Kiln 
Crossing. This fact, in connection with the improved methods of 
loading and unloading cargoes, makes it posible to transport wheat 
a thousand miles, from Duluth to Buffalo, for two or three cents 
per bushel, or transport iron ore, lumber and other products at 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 241 
prodigiously low rates. The importance of an inland waterway 
can be further enforced by supposing an arm of the sea stretching 
inland from the Gulf of Mexico along the Mississippi channel to 
Memphis or St. Louis. This arm of the sea would wonderfully fa- 
cilitate the commerce of the Mississippi Valley and add greatly to 
the value of the products of this valley; but it would occupy hun- 
dreds of thousands of acres now in cultivation. The value of the 
land occupied by such hypothetical arm of the sea would more 
than pay for a deep waterway from Chicago, via the Chicago Drain- 
age Canal and the Mississippi River, to the Gulf of Mexico. 
Rivers are vital for commerce, for power, and for irrigation. It 
kindles the interest of pupils to picture to them how the rivers 
of the earth, on their way to the sea, lift the burdens from man 
and beast and from the locomotives, and carry them, without toll, 
to the seaboard; how that the time came when Fulton made it 
possible to carry cargoes along these free navigable channels 
against the current; and how the construction of jetties and ley- 
ies; also canals to surmount rapids and connect headwaters of riv- 
ers flowing in opposite directions, is adding to human well-being 
through facilitating commerce and, consequently, giving cheaper 
finished products. 
The cities located on the fall line are of interest to the pupils 
when they comprehend that they have been located and largely 
made by the water power and the tide water. A still greater in- 
terest is added to rapids and falls through the use of the power to 
produce electricity to be used at distant points for transportation, 
for electric lighting, and for manufacture. Irrigation interests the 
pupil when he comprehends that not a single grain of soil-food 
can be used for plant nutrition unless it is dissolved in water so 
that it can be absorbed through the tiny root hairs. Through the 
proper kind of teaching, the great irrigation plants and the pro- 
jects for land reclamation by private enterprise, state and nation, 
become extremely interesting; likewise, fertilization and rotation 
of crops. 
The foreging is but a brief outline of what the teachers would 
be expected to develop concretely in detail. Any one of these brief 
statements is susceptible of such concrete development and expan- 
sion as will deeply interest the pupils. Any geographic fact that 
cannot be thus vitalized had better be omitted from the course of 
study. 
' Permit me to illustrate how some of these topics lend them- 
selves to concrete development. Many of the rivers of Germany 
16 
   
-P-A-G-E-242
  242 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
and France which flow in opposite directions are connected by 
canals. The lowlands of China are threaded by tens of thousands 
of miles of canals. A concrete and graphic description of the man- 
ner in which these canals further the commerce of these countries 
will prove of intense interest to the pupils. The Kiehl Canal, which 
connects the Baltic with the North Sea, not only enables mer- 
chant vessels bound from the Baltic to the North Sea, or vice versa, 
to avoid a long and dangerous route through the straits, but en 
ables the German Empire to put its war vessels from one sea to 
another in a few hours. 
Savage man confronted by an arm of the sea had no way of sur- 
mounting it but by swimming. Later a savage superior to his fel- 
lows, by the use of rude stone implements and fire, laboriously con 
structed a clumsy dugout and paddled his way across the inter- 
vening waters. Still later, another superior savage erected upright 
poles and stretched the skins of animals between them, and the 
winds filled his rude sails and carried him across the water with- 
out muscular effort. This was the beginning of the sail boat, which 
later covered the seas. Still later, came Watt with his steam en 
gine and Fulton with his steamboat. 
At first, because of the St. Mary’s Rapids and other obstructions, 
the Great Lakes could be traversed by canoe only. Later, with the 
construction of the first canal around St. Mary’s Rapids, larger 
lake craft were possible; still later, by the enlarging of this canal 
and the locks and the deepening of the channel on the St. Clare 
Flats and at the Lime Kiln Crossing, still larger lake craft. And 
as the channel was so deepened and larger vessels made possible, 
freights were cheapened. It is estimated that the deepening of the 
lake channel between Duluth and Buffalo on foot is worth tens of 
millions of dollars to commerce; for as vessels increase in size, 
their operating expenses do not increase as does their freight-car- 
rying capacity. The Welland Canal around Niagara Falls, and 
the canals around the rapids of the St. Lawrence are only fourteen 
feet deep. If these canals were twenty feet deep, the greatest lake 
craft, drawing twenty feet of water, could pass without breaking 
cargo from Duluth down the St. Lawrence to the ports of the 
world. 
The Mohawk Valley in: New York has been worth hundreds of 
millions of dollars to commerce and will yet be worth many mil- 
lions. It made the Erie Canal possible, and gave the New ‘York 
Central Railroad the advantage in grades over all railroads taking 
other routes from the Atlantic seaboard to the Mississippi Valley.

Volumes have been written upon the value of the Erie Canal to 
the commerce of the United States. If this is true of a seven or 
eight-foot channel connecting the Great Lakes with the tidewater 
of the Hudson, what will be true of a twenty-foot channel per- 
’ mitting the greatest lake craft to pass through this valley to the 
Hudson and on through the Narrows to the ports of the world? 
The time will no doubt come when ocean steamers drawing thirty 
feet of water will pass up the Hudson and through a ship canal 
to the Great Lakes, and possibly through the Lakes to Duluth. And 
when that time comes, the Mississippi River will have been har- 
nessed, and large vessels will be passing from Chicago to the Gulf 
of Mexico via the Chicago Drainage Canal and the Mississippi 
River. 
It is the doctrine of this paper that facts in geography should 
be emphasized in proportion to their service to man. Judged by 
this criterion, the regions to be emphasized in Africa are the Nile 
Valley, the Congo Valley and Southern Africa. The Mississippi 
River compared with the St. Lawrence River has the advantage 
in its length, the productiveness of the valley through which it 
flows, and its comparative freedom from ice during the year, 
and from rapids and falls. It has a disadvantage in overflowing 
its banks, in being continually choked with silt, and obstructed by 
snags. Instead of memorizing the dry facts concerning cities and 
towns, pupils, under the guidance of the teacher, should be stimu- 
lated to marshal arguments showing why certain cities are better 
worth studying than others. 
This proposed vital course in geography is in harmony with the 
doctrine of “education for efficiency.” It proposes to bring the pupil 
into vital contact with race achievement from primitive beginnings, 
thus not only enabling him to understand and appreciate the race 
heritage, but to be able to add to it. Man, at each step of his prog- 
ress, has pictured to himself some form of human well-being and has 
devised means for its realization. Under the inspiration of a de- 
sire for human well-being in greater measure or higher quality, 
he has, through centuries, lifted himself from primitive ignorance, 
penury and weakness, to culture, wealth and power. This desire 
for a greater measure of well-being has been the master motive 
that has guided him in his triumphal march from helplessness to 
dominion and power; has been his pillar of cloud by day, and pillar 
of fire by night. 
Man, through the invention of fire and weapons, first gained do- 
minion over the wild beasts, and is now rapidly gaining dominion

over the disease-carrying animals that are infinitely small. We are 
learning that the anopholes and stygomia mosquitoes and the house 
fly, together with disease germs, are much more to be feared than 
the most ferocious animals with which our ancestors contended. 
Man, in succession has harnessed the domestic animals, the winds, 
waterfalls, steam and electricity; and is now engaged in attempts 
to harness the atmosphere for navigation; and when the last ton of 
coal shall have been mined, I doubt not that he will have har- 
nessed not only the rapids and falls of the rivers, but the ordinary 
flow seaward, and the waves that roll in upon the beach, and have 
dedicated them to his service in the production of energy in the 
form of mechanical power, light, heat and electricity. 
ProBLeMS or STatH SUPERVISION. 
HENRY J. WILLINGHAM OF ALABAMA. 
The problems of state supervision of public schools involve all 
the problems of the subordinate units which make up the state. 
The powers, the duties and the obligations devolving upon state 
superintendents vary considerably among the states, according as 
the state laws concentrate in the State Superintendent’s office, 
sometimes more and sometimes less, of these obligations. For the 
most part, however, his time and his attention are devoted largely 
to seeing that the school laws in all the varying phases of educa- 
tional effort are faithfully executed. His experience and observa- 
tion, being in daily touch with the whole state system, usually en- 
able him, however, to make recommendations to the Legislature for 
the enactment of legislation beneficial to the educational system. 
Not all of his recommendations, however, are accepted unani- 
mously in any state, because the subject-matter of education is a 
field of activity in which a large percentage of the population are 
willing to admit that they are, each one for himself, the highest au- 
thority on the subect. All of them have attended school more or 
less, and therefore have learned all about it. 
State supervision is obtained almost wholly by indirect methods 
instead of through personal observation by the superintendent. In 
the very nature of things, nothing else is possible. The county su- 
perintendents, each in his own county, perform, for the most part, 
whatever work of supervision is given to the rural public schools of 
that county. The city superintendents, of course, have charge of 
the work in his own city. Close supervision in the towns and cities 
is not only possible, but it is being obtained to a large extent, and
-P-A-G-E-245

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 245 
that quite satisfactorily. But the public schools in the rural sec- 
tions, widely scattered as they are, and depending on one man, the 
county superintendent, for watchful and expert supervision, pre- 
sent the real problems touching this subject. The county superin- 
tendent, even if he is highly qualified for the duties of his office, 
is frequently required to spend a considerable part of his time in 
the clerical duties at his desk, when, in truth, he ought to be al- 
lowed and even required to spend practically all of his time in 
visiting the rural and village schools of his county. In some states 
the superintendent is not required to devote his entire time to the 
duties of his office. In fact, his attention may be taken in a large 
measure to the transaction of private business apart from the pub- 
lic schools. In such cases there is no supervision of the rural 
schools worthy of the name, but each teacher is left to himself to do 
the best he can, draw his monthly salary, and at the close of the 
term go, as he usually does, to some other community, where the 
same process is repeated next year. 
The administration of the state superintendent’s office, dependent 
as it is upon the school officials in the subordinate divisions through- 
out the state, has but little effect or bearing upon those communi- 
ties not closely supervised by the subordinate officials. 
One of the problems of supervision has been the necessity of 
bringing the average layman to understand the real worth of su- 
pervision. This difficulty has not been met recently as a serious 
obstacle in city administration, because years ago the people in the 
larger towns and cities recognized the fact that a good superin- 
tendent devoting himself entirely to the work of supervision was 
an absolute necessity in the maintenance of an efficient school sys- 
tiem. On account of that correct view and just appreciation of 
supervision on the part of city people, the more is the wonder that 
a rural population has not long since come to see the wisdom of de- 
manding closer supervision of rural public schools. State super- 
intendents, without exception, through years and years past, have 
been urging the necessity throughout the South of bringing each 
rural school under closer supervision of strong men and women 
trained and fitted for such work. Commendable progress in most 
of the states is being made toward accomplishing this much de- 
sired result. The time will come, in my opinion, in a few years 
more when practically all of our rural schools will have that super- 
vision which alone will bring them up to a standard of reasonable 
efficiency. In no other busines in the world are large sums of 
money invested with so little regard to results through lack of su-

pervision as in the business of public education administered 
through the states and counties of our common country. Even in 
the erection of one skyscraper building a large number of experts 
employed on high salaries are constantly engaged, each one su- 
pervising his own department of the work, seeing that each em- 
ployee is performing well and faithfully the tasks assigned to him, 
and whenever helpful suggestions are needed, the superintendent 
of the division is ever near to make the desired suggestion. If this 
were not a good business policy, business men and contractors would 
‘reduce their payrolls by removing the names of these high-priced 
experts whose time is devoted to the direction of others, and just 
allow each employee to direct himself, without aid or suggestion, as 
is done by the state when each teacher is employed on a fixed salary 
and allowed to direct himself by his own sweet will.and pleasure. 
The state superintendent cannot even by mail reach with sug- 
gestions the great army of teachers scattered throughout the state. 
Besides, he cannot personally view each local situation from his 
desk in the office at the Capitol. Through suggestions of a general 
nature, using courses of study, manuals and sundry helps to the 
teachers, he can render some public service in a general way through 
this indirect touch with the schoolrooms of the state. Even if a 
large part of his time is taken in visiting the schools themselves, 
only a very small percentage of them could actually be reached. By 
gathering from all possible sources information of value to the pub- 
lie schools, and disseminating among the teachers through letters, 
circulars, pamphlets and reports, the results of his investigations, 
some assistance will be given in this way to the teachers. 
A considerable part of the state superintendent’s time must of 
necessity be devoted to the administration and technical enforce- 
ment of the school laws on the statute books. While he can not 
authorize the violation of any law which may be on the statute 
books, the execution of any given statute brings to his office from 
the public at large a number of requests for exceptions in the law’s 
enforcement. He must remember that the people were not made 
for the laws, but that the laws were made for the betterment of con- 
ditions among the people; and while the faithful performance of 
his duty requires him to enforce without partiality all the laws, 
the exercise of reasonable discretion, where any is allowed, will 
frequently make or mar the welfare of the community. 
In recent years a number of the Southern States have been per- 
mitted, through the generosity of the General Education Board, to 
appoint, without expense to the states, rural supervisors and high
-P-A-G-E-247
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 247: 
school inspectors whose services are of incalculable benefit to the 
school systems in rendering them more efficient and in obtaining 
for the people a higher quality of service for the millions of dollars 
annually expended in public education. These rural supervisors 
and high school inspectors will, in due course of time, through the 
valuable work which they are doing, bring the public to have a just 
regard for the value and for the necessity of a closer and better 
organized system of supervision for all the schools. 
Happy is that man in the office of state superintendent who is ac- 
corded the fullest measure of codperation by school officials, by 
teachers and by the public. He can not hope to please them all. In 
fact, it is a most difficult task for one even to please himself by so- 
acting at all times as to give him an approving conscience in doing 
the right thing as he sees it, and at all times the best that is in him. 
Department Higher Education. 
MINUTES. 
The Department of Higher Education met in the Girls’ High 
School building at 2:00 p.m. The absence of speakers to whom the 
subject for discussion had been originally assigned necessitated a 
considerable change in the program as at first announced. Al! of 
the topics, however, were covered with the exception of one, and 
some valuable and interesting discussions resulted. The following 
is an outline of the program as carried out: 
Topic: “The Proper Plan of Teaching and Evaluating Those Sub- 
jects Which Appear in Both the High School and the College Cur- 
riculum.” Presented and explained briefly by the President and 
discussed by the members present. 
Topic: “On What Terms Should the Work of the Short Summer 
Session Be Accepted for College Credit”? Paper by Dr. A. B. Din- 
widdie. The speaker gave a short history of the summer school in 
its relation to the college curriculum; stated the difficulties that 
had arisen in connection with the credits to be assigned to the work 
of the summer session; and outlined a plan by which some of the 
chief problems might be met. 
Topic: “The Best Treatment of Conditioned Students.” Paper by 
Dr. E. A. Bechtel. The subject was treated entirely in reference to 
entrance conditions, and statistics were given affording a compari- 
son between the certificate and the examination plans of entering 
students as effecting the question of conditions. This paper caused 
   
-P-A-G-E-248

the most extended and interesting discusion of the afternoon, and 
brought out much valuable information concerning the treatment 
of the problem of various colleges. 
Topic: “The Relation of the Privately Endowed College or Uni- 
versity to the Public Schools.” In the absence of President Hinitt, 
who was to have presented the paper, Chancellor Dinwiddie of the 
Southwestern Presbyterian University was asked to give an in- 
formal address. Some of the main problems involved were stated, 
and were discussed by those present. 
It was decided to leave the appointment of the officers for this 
department to the President of the Association.

The object of this paper is not to make a complete study of the 
question of summer school credits, but to present certain problems 
which have come within the observation of the writer, and which 
are doubtless a matter of common experience with Southern uni- 
yersities; and to indicate the means which Tulane has adopted to 
meet the various difficulties to which these problems have given rise. 
The summer school is so recent a development in our educational 
system that it is not necessary to go into its history at the present 
time. It has had, and still has, many different forms, from the 
teachers’ institute, lasting from one to four weeks, and following 
a definite program, to the chatauqua, which provides a maximum 
of entertainment with a minimum of prescribed work on the part 
of the student. Each of these forms serves a real purpose, but the 
demand has arisen for a well-defined, codrdinated plan of summer 
work, which shall, on the one hand, be cumulative in its results and 
shall,-on the other hand, meet accepted standards as to quality and 
amount. Such a plan can best be organized and maintained by per- 
manent agencies. The agencies best fitted for this are the colleges 
and universities, not only because they are prepared to preserve a 
continuity of the work from year to year, and to furnish well-or- 
dered and complete records of the same, but because they alone 
can provide adequate equipment to meet the present demands of 
the summer student. To the colleges, therefore, falls the duty of 
properly safeguarding the standards of the summer school with 
reference to the college curriculum, and, in particular, of furnish- 
ing an accurate and simple system of crediting summer work which 
shall do justice both to the student and the college.
-P-A-G-E-249
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 249 
It must be recognized that the summer school has to meet many 
demands that fall outside of the scope of the regular college curric- 
ulum. It is legitimate, therefore, that the college should in its 
summer school offer courses to which college credit is not attached. 
Tt is necessary, on the other hand, that there should be a sufficient 
number and variety of courses of college grades to enable teachers 
and others to accumulate through a series of years the full number 
of credits for the college degree. Few college authorities are able 
to, or are inclined to, maintain a full term of summer work. The 
problem for most of us is, therefore, to determine the question of 
credits for the short summer course. We shall confine our discus- 
sion to the organization of the summer course for college credits 
and its relation to the college curriculum. 
The Tulane Summer School has been in operation five years. The 
duration of the session has varied during that time as follows: 
1908, five weeks; 1909, nine weeks; 1910, six weeks; 1911, nine 
weeks; 1912, nine weeks. In 1909 the State Board of Louisiana 
decided that no teacher should receive credit towards a State Cer- 
tificate except upon completion of nine weeks’ course, and the term 
was extended to meet this requirement. The New Orleans School 
Board recognized six weeks’ courses, and as the majority of the 
teachers in attendance were from New Orleans, it was decided 
in 1910 to reduce the summer term to six weeks. It is interesting 
to note that this caused no decrease in the attendance of teachers 
from Louisiana outside of New Orleans, though the state regulation, 
requiring nine weeks for credit was still in force. After a careful 
study of the question from the standpoint of a three years’ expe- 
rience, it was decided to fix the term at nine weeks for the future. 
Tulane was led to this decision chiefly through the difficulties of 
organizing many of the courses on the six weeks basis. Tulane and 
the New Orleans Board both recognized credits for six weeks, as well 
as for nine weeks, and most of the courses are so arranged that at 
the end of six weeks the student will have completed a definite part 
of the work and will receive credit for a full six weeks’ course. 
Students may enroll for the whole period or for such a part as they 
may desire, but no credit is given for less than six weeks of work. 
Each class meets daily. A nine weeks’ course of six hours per 
week is thus equivalent, in lecture hours, to an eighteen weeks’ course 
of three hours per week. A nine weeks’ course, therefore entitles the 
student to a credit of one-half of one college year’s work in that sub- 
ject. A six weeks’ course is accepted for a credit of one-third of the 
year’s work in the university. It should be stated by way of explana-
-P-A-G-E-250
  250 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
tion that the State Board requires six hours per week in each course. 
Tulane would prefer five hours per week and would be willing to 
give the same credit for courses as at present. 
It is evident that difficulties will arise in the assembling of credits 
that correspond to fractional parts of the year’s work. These diffi- 
culties are met or obviated in several ways: First, by the refusal to 
give college credit for six weeks’ work in every case in which that 
amount of work does not represent a definite, well-rounded course, 
complete in itself; second, by arranging courses in sequence from 
year to year, so that students in successive summers may carry to 
completion the full year’s work in the subject; third, by offering 
double or even triple courses in certain subjects in which it is 
especially desirable that the study should not be interrupted. A 
number of courses are offered on the latter plan. A course two 
hours daily for nine weeks is equivalent in hours to a full session’s 
work in a class meeting three times a week. The modern language 
courses, for instance, are all arranged on this basis. A student may 
complete the equivalent of a year’s work in a modern language by 
taking a double course in the summer school. He could, of course, 
do little work in addition to this, and this fact is recognized by 
placing the maximum amount of work a student may undertake in 
one summer at three courses or the equivalent. In addition to the 
double courses in modern languages, single courses are also offered 
in the same subjects for those not desiring college credit. In the 
laboratory science courses are given requiring three hours per day, 
the time to be divided between lectures and laboratory work, as 
conditions demand. No college credit is given for such courses 
except for the full nine weeks. It may be said that the abridgment 
of the time given to these subjects is a disadvantage, and this applies 
more particularly to the sciences than to modern languages, but it 
cannot be denied that there is an immense gain in concentration, 
and the results have been on the whole most satisfactory. 
It is not possible to give here the organization of the work in 
English, history, mathematics, etc., in which, by the arrangement of 
complementary courses, opportunity is given the student to take 
one-third, one-half, or the whole, of a year’s work in a subject during 
the summer term. 
It will be seen that I have treated the subject constructively by 
attempting to show how summer courses may be organized so as 
to avoid the difficulties connected with the problem of summer 
school credit. The question of evaluating credits presented from 
other summer schools is a more serious one, and I must confess
-P-A-G-E-251
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 251 
that we have had to reject a great number of these, frequently be- 
cause the organization of the school had no reference to the college 
plan, frequently because of the obvious inadequacy of the work done. 
The solution of the problem would not be reached through a study 
of summer school credits offered, but through a reorganization of 
summer schools with reference to the question of college credits, 
insofar as these schools profess to offer work of college grade and 
for college credit. 
Tue Best TREATMENT oF ConpiTIonED STuDENTS. 
DR. BH. A. BECHTEL, NEW ORLNANS, LA. 
The college of today has no need to pray for the divine gift of 
“seeing ourselves as others see us.” Does not every journal, every 
fifteen-cent magazine, every popular weekly delight in pointing out 
to us our weaknesses, our inconsistencies, our lack of logic? And 
does not the efficiency expert constantly remind us of our failure 
to utilize fully our educational plant, in which neither professor nor 
student is “speeded” up to the proper limit, while the output in 
research and culture in accumulation of fact and building of char 
acter is so far from being “standardized?” 
In the topic before us it must be admitted that our laymen critics 
might find considerable justification for their complaints. The ad- 
mission of the conditioned student does seem illogical. His status 
is anomalous; neither barred out of the kingdom of the college, nor 
yet admitted to its full fellowship, for him there is no recognition 
of the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints; he is in a state 
of probation, consequently he is to be regarded with a degree of 
suspicion by his stronger brethren. And his burden is certainly 
greater than theirs. We say to him, “you come into our freshman 
class handicapped by the fact that your previous educational attain- 
ments are not of the standard demanded of the normal student, yet 
you are expected to do the work set for those who are fully pre- 
pared and in addition to exert yourself to make good the deficiencies 
of your earlier training.” Truly the curse of the poor is their 
poverty! 
The danger of inefficiency is also great. If any considerable pro- 
portion of an entering class is admitted with conditions of one, two, 
three units, or even more, thus manifesting clearly their unwilling- 
ness or inability to complete satisfactorily those courses regarded 
as an essential preliminary to the college curriculum, how, then, 
we may well ask, can the proper standard of work within the col- 
   
-P-A-G-E-252
  252 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
lege be maintained? An instructor is necessarily influenced, even 
though unconsciously, by the needs of the weaker members of his 
class, and the demands made of the class as a whole are under these 
circumstances generally less severe. If we suppose the number of 
conditioned students to form a large majority of the whole class, 
with the resulting paradox that the more satisfying the supposedly 
normal requirements is really abnormal, then the lack of logic in 
the system and the certainty of loss of efficiency in its practical 
working seem proved beyond a shadow of doubt. To show that this 
apprehension is not unfounded or exaggerated, it is only necessary 
to cite actual facts. And our statistics will be taken from the 
records, not of the young, weak, poorly endowed college of the South 
or West, but from one of the oldest, wealthiest and strongest of 
the Eastern universities. 
In the report of the President of Yale University for the year 
1911 to 1912 we find the following table :1 
Of the 348 students making up the freshman class in 1911, 128, 
or 36.8 per cent, entered without condition; 70, or 20 per cent, had 
one condition; 60, or 17.2 per cent, had two conditions; 90, or 26 
per cent, had three or more conditions. 
In other words, only a little more than one-third of the entering 
class had fully satisfied all the demands made by the university, 
while slightly over one-fourth of the class fell so far short of this 
standard that it would appear that nearly a year’s work in a 
preparatory school would be required to make good their deficiencies. 
That the best work is possible under these. conditions surely no one 
can maintain. 
In many instances it will be discovered that this deplorable sit- 
uation is due to the system of admission by examination, or rather 
to the laxity with which the system is administered. Two extracts 
from the twelfth annual report of the college entrance board seem 
to confirm this view.2. “From these tables it appears that of the 
total number of examinations taken only 70 per cent had the recom- 
mendation of the teacher. If, for the sake of argument, we regard

University has not been selected because it makes a specialty of poor showing. 
Unfortunately, in many institutions the situation is far worse. See the 
report of the Association of Southern Colleges and Preparatory Schools for 
1911, pages 43 and 46.

and 47. ‘

  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 253 
60 as the “passing mark,” we find that only 54 per cent of the total 
number of examinations were successful, while 62 per cent of the 
recommended examinations resulted satisfactorily. 
Again we read in the same report, “in the first place the colleges 
that accept secondary school certificates receive their best students 
on the basis of such certificates. Only those candidates whose 
preparation is of doubtful character or is known to be weak are, 
as a rule, required by such colleges to take admission examinations.” 
Only those charged with administrative duties in connection with 
the admission of students can realize the importunity of the young 
man who desires a “short cut” into college. The appeal of athletics, 
the glamor of fraternity life make him discontented with his prepara- 
tory school; he is in haste to finish college work and to turn to busi- 
ness or to his profession; a proud parent thinks him too bright to 
waste his time with his less favored schoolmates (an opinion with 
which the boy finds himself most heartily in accord) ; whatever the 
motive, the candidate is all too ready with the easy optimism of 
youth to “take a chance.” He is permitted to try the examinations, 
and under the guidance of Fors Fortuna, who has selected the 
examination room as one of her favored haunts, he does manage to 
pass enough subjects to secure the minimum number of points to 
admit him as a conditioned student. Who can doubt the injury not 
only to the boy himself, but also to the school which he has so 
ungraciously left and to the university which he prematurely enters? 
To prevent this abuse the faculty of Tulane University, on the 
recommendation of the committee on admission, two years ago 
passed the following rule: “No student. coming from a secondary 
school of which he is not a graduate shall be admitted to entrance 
examinations unless at least a year shall have elapsed since he was 
enrolled in that school, and then only at the discretion of the chair- 
man of the committee on admission.” While this rule may possibly 
in a few instances work a slight hardship, we feel that it is reason- 
able and affords proper protection both to the secondard schools 
and to the university. 
Under the certificate plan we have found the proportion of stud- 
ents entering with conditions very much less than under the 
examination system. In the first place the candidate must be a 
graduate of a four-year high school course in order that his certifi- 
cate may gain recognition. Again, the rules of Tulane University 
specify certain subjects as “fundamental;” for example, the three 
units in English, three units in mathematics and two units in a 
foreign language. Without these fundamental units and a sufficient  
-P-A-G-E-254
  254 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
number of additional units to make up the twelve, which are the 
minimum under which one can enter, he may not come in even as 
a conditioned student. These subjects have been selected because 
of the belief that they are necessary prerequisites for the student’s 
first work in the university. 
How well this works out in actual practice may best be learned 
from the study of the following statistics of this year’s freshman 
class in arts and sciences (men and women), technology (men), 
education and art (women), including only those who entered by 
certificate :

  *Of the men admitted with the smaller number of units, nearly all are

ment, or else from other colleges. 
One may then naturally ask, “why any conditioned students at 
all under the certificate system?” Such a desirable result may easily 
be gained at too great a price. In a catalogue of one of our new 
colleges that has just sprung a second Athene from the purse of 
Croesus we read on page 21: “Concerning the standard of entrance 
requirements, it is significant that ————— college will admit no 
conditioned students and no special students. No one will be ad- 
mitted to —-———— college unless he fully satisfies the require- 
ments for admission before entrance, and no candidate failing to 
meet this standard will be admitted to the college under the name 
of special student.” What are these requirements? A few pages 
later we are told, “the first requirement for admission is the credit- 
able completion of a four-year high school course of standard grade, 
or its equivalent.” A little later, however, it is suggested that for
-P-A-G-E-255
        JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 255 
a bright boy three years is just as good as four, or a little better. 
“The college does not require that this work be done in a conven- 
tional time or manner. In general, any substantial subject which 
is well taught, whether or not it is vocational, counts towards ad- 
mission. No prescriptions whatever are made concerning the sub- 
jects to be offered for admission.” After this statement of require- 
ments one ceases to wonder that no conditioned students are ad- 
mitted; the real miracle would consist in the possibility of a con- 
dition. 
There are some of us, however, who still insist that the college 
has no right to prescribe certain subjects as prerequisites for its 
courses, and in maintaining this position we are not alarmed by the 
terrors of the bugaboo of “dictation to the high school.” The univer- 
sity or college has no right, and no desire, to say to the high school, 
“you must teach this subject; that subject you must omit from your 
curriculum.” But the university or the college does have the right 
to make its own curriculum and to insist that, in order to enter 
upon study in that curriculum, certain subjects are a necessary pre- 
requisite. As far, then, as there exists a lack of adjustment between 
college and secondary school curriculum so far, and so far only, 
does the necessity exist of admitting students under the handicap of 
conditions. We say to the candidate, “you have received a fair 
amount of training; it is not right that you should be excluded 
altogether from our institution or even asked to postpone your 
entrance for a year. We do think it advisable, however, for you to 
gain a wider acquaintance with certain subjects or do more intensive 
work in this particular line in order that you may fully attain the 
standard we have set for our students.” Recognizing this situation 
as an emergency—a regrettable emergency—we must face it as best 
we can. Hence, the practical but perplexing question, how is the 
condition to be removed? Various answers will be considered, but 
very briefly ; for it must be admitted that the really important mat- 
ter is not the detail of this substitute or that, but rather the re- 
moyal of the necessity of any substitute at all for deficiencies in the 
preliminary course. Like the medical profession, we should recog- 
nize that our most effective work lies in the prevention of ills rather 
than in the treatment of the invalid. 
One method of meeting the difficulty I think most of us are willing 
to pass over as not appropriate to the institution we represent. I 
refer to the preparatory school within the college, either frankly 
recognized by that name or thinly disguised under the euphemism of 
a “two years’ course in agriculture.”

  A more effective and more widely practiced method is the substitu- 
tion of college courses for the lacking entrance units. Certain serious 
difficulties, however, at once arise. How are the college courses to 
be evaluated in terms of high school units? Are the college courses 
in any sense the real equivalents of those subjects omitted in the 
high school? In some instances, it is true, substitution is compara- 
tively easy. In practically all colleges elementary courses are given 
in French, Spanish and German; sometimes, too, the opportunity is 
granted to obtain instruction in certain subjects for which one can- 
not receive college credit. This is true at Tulane, for example, of a 
course in the first six books of Virgil’s Aeneid. But even granting 
the possibility of finding a sufficient number of college subjects that 
may properly be regarded as substitutes, must these courses be 
carried by the student in addition to his prescribed work? Such a 
demand would result in undoubted injury to the student; he cannot 
do all well; something must be neglected. Suppose he puts off for 
a year a part of his regular freshman work—the day of reckoning is 
only postponed. Especially if his curriculum is made up in large 
part of required subjects, the difficulty of making a proper schedule 
adds to his embarrassment. From year to year he passes on with 
something always due on last year’s account, until the senior year— 
if, indeed, he persists so long—finds him discouraged and discomfited. 
Doubtless it would have been a wiser plan had he postponed for one 
year his entrance to the freshman class. 
Another proposal is that the deficient student be required to secure 
a competent tutor under whose instruction he shall prepare for the 
necessary examinations, which are, of course, given by the university 
professor. To the difficulty of an overcrowded schedule, already men- 
tioned, is now added the very serious objection that it is often im- 
possible to secure properly prepared tutors, who know the subject 
and can really teach it. The guidance of a classmate who possesses 
little more knowledge than the unfortunate whom he seeks to help, 
is indeed a poor substitute for the instruction of an experienced 
secondary school man. Nor should the burden of the added expense 
be overlooked. It may be that the conditioned student finds himself 
thus handicapped in his class simply because his parents could not 
afford to send him away from home to a better equipped fitting school 
and that then this added expense of really good private instruction 
would prove too great a load to be carried. 
Probably the least unsatisfactory solution of our perplexing prob- 
lem may be found in the rapid development and growing popularity 
during the past few years of the “summer school.” The conviction   
-P-A-G-E-257
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 257 
is gaining ground that it is not sufficient to use our educational 
“plant” during eight or nine months of the year only; during the 
long summer months there is an opportunity to meet the special de- 
mand of those whose needs are not the needs of the average student. 
Cencentration in one or two subjects makes it possible, during a nine 
or twelve weeks’ term, to accomplish the equivalent of a year’s high 
schoo! course in that subject. Thus the needed credit may be secured 
without adding to the already full schedule of the freshman year or 
rendering necessary the “scrifice” of college courses for high school 
credit. Certainly the expense would be less than the fees of a really 
competent private instructor. 
Above all, whatever plan we adopt, let it be regarded only as a 
temporary device of expediency. The aim should be to secure the full 
entrance requirement from all students, working with this object be- 
fore us in complete harmony with our secondary schools; the con- 
ditioned or special student should indeed be the exceptional student. 
Thus only can a proper standard of freshman work be maintained, 
and it is to be remembered, in the words of the head of the Carnegie 
Foundation, that “the standard of the freshman year fixes the stand- 
ard of the college.”

In estimating the value of a subject in our curriculum of education 
it is advisable to ascertain to what extent it functions into the life 
habits of the people. A subject is valuable as it articulates into the 
daily life and labors of those who use that subject as a source of in- 
formation. Again, that subject in educational effort is valuable as 
its characteristic results merge into the more permanent aspects of 
civilized society; and conversely that subject is of little value in 
education which tends to minister to transitory and ephemeral con- 
ditions in our social and economic life. In the light of these truths 
must a subject stand or fall before the bar of educational judgment. 
Education for efficiency is not only quite popular in our modern 
educational philosophy, but it is a truth that cannot and should not 
be ignored. In the selection of subject-matter for study, experience 
has taught us that young people should study the elementary facts 
and principles of quite a variety of subjects in order that they may 
be able to form the proper mental habits in handling facts over a 
large field of investigation. This enables the student to determine 
much more readily the particular field wherein his pleasure and 
powers lie. Again this larger field of opportunity affords ample room 
for proper training for service and usefulness which should be the 
prime object in education. Information with skill in application 
and power in accomplishment are the supreme motives in education 
irrespective of the line in which the individual may be called to 
apply his powers. The important fact is the creation or formation 
of sound mental habits of thought and action in the minds of those 
who are being educated. 
In the transformations now rapidly going on in our educational 
systems there is a striking tendency to make the student’s school 
life intimately connected with his daily life out of school and to 
make it a distinctive and controlling part of his whole life. The con- 
servation of youthful energy and training it into useful lines of 
service is one expression of the great principle of conservation so 
prominently before the public mind today.

Industrial education under various captions has claimed the atten- 
tion of educational propagandists and readjusters for some time. The 
practical in education is demanding and receiving attention. It is 
coming to be understood that a subject in the course of study may 
be both practical and cultural and that it is no less valuable for the 
one because it can do the other. The demands for industrial train- 
ing are becoming more consistent with the general trend of educa- 
tional sentiment. Readjustment is going on in the industries as well 
as in the schools. The universality of opportunity is taking the place 
of special privileges in education. The schools are coing to recognize 
the social interdependence of the vocations and industries. The voca- 
tions even are being called upon for specific contributions to society. 
This larger view of one’s duty to the social order tends to give a 
social significance to vocational training heretofore unrecognized. In 
a social democracy, such as. ours, school and social service are closely 
connected. 
While the adaptation of education to life is eminently proper, we ; | 
should not be so shortsighted as to adapt it to environment. Educa- | 
tion properly directed should. enable the individual to rise superior | 
to environment. That education which would limit the individual : 
to his environment is founded on a misconception of the highest civic 
and social usefulness. What should be done is to give the student | 
the opportunity to find his capabilities and to prepare for the largest 
possible usefulness in his life career. .Subject-matter in the curric- 
ulum which will do this evidently articulates directly into the per- 
manent phases of the social body. 
Our system of education must take account of the changes going 
on in the world and readjust itself so as to be able to serve the people 
who are affected by these changes. Ours is not a static civilization, 
but an ever-changing one. Our educational system must so change 
its activities as to make our civilization an ever-progressive one as 
it changes. 
When manual training was first made a part of educational sub- 
ject matter for instruction many professed to see in it a lowering of 
educational values. How far wrong they prophesied the success of 
the movement is striking evidence. When the manual training idea 
enlarged into the idea of industrial education another vigorous pro- 
test was made by those who belonged to the old order, and when 
vocational education became a candidate for public favor the limit 
was reached in the estimation of the alarmists. But the test of 
experience has shown all three to have their values in our educational 
agencies. Industrial education is a paying investment for the in-   
   
-P-A-G-E-260

dividual and nation as well. “In the international struggle for 
commercial supremacy the balance must tip in favor of the land 
whose workers are most skillful and intelligent.” Skill alone is not 
sufficient. Intelligent skill is essential. That subject in the curric- 
ulum which will produce skill and intelligence at the same time is 
the subject possessing a double value as an agent in education. It is 
a deep concern of society to equip the youth of today with the tools 
for earning a livelihood and to see that he is economically efficient. 
Society is not only concerned in trade supremacy, but is vitally con- 
cerned in the moral worth and character supremacy of her young 
people. 
The vocational school is to be measured by its ability to fit its 
students for moral, social and economic efficiency. This it has ap- 
parently been able to accomplish. Its workshop has not supplanted 
but supplemented the curriculum for general information and cul- 
ture. It has succeeded in redirecting general educational activities 
and operating them along special lines. It has been wise enough to 
recognize the fact that special education is based upon and follows 
the general education. Better still, it has so intertwined the two 
that skill and culture are dual results expected and achieved. The 
interested activity of the student in the vocational school bears fruit 
in the chambers of reflective thought; industry sows the seeds and 
philosophic leisure garners the fruitful grain. The vocational school 
uses its appliances to develop the normal child into the normal man 
or woman. The vocational school enters a vigorous protest against 
the mechanizing process of industry so common in the industrial 
life. It seeks to develop the artist as well as the artisan. It would 
reserve for every child of industry his birthright for pleasure and 
enjoyment in life. It would bring into his life that strong love for 
excellence of service which grows into effective means of producing 
real works of art in our industrial life. The vocational school 
emphasizing intelligence and skill alike produces a thought reserve 
which saves the workman from the slavish dominance and dull 
monotony of overmechanized industry. 
The fact that the factory now does much that the home formerly 
did necessitates the existence of the vocational school that the child 
of today may have the opportunity which the child of yesterday had. 
The vocational school must be ready to serve that vast throng of our 
young people who feel that for one reason or another they must be- 
come wage earners early in life. Our public school system must in- 
clude vocational training for the surprisingly large number of our 
young people who feel that they must take up the business of making
-P-A-G-E-261
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 261 
a living as soon as they complete the course of elementary instruc- 
tion. This important work cannot be neglected without ‘weakening 
the moral fiber of our citizenship, lowering the level of efficiency in 
our industrial life and leaving the destiny of our social institutions 
to a lower ideal in economic life. The vocational school must offer 
the opportunity for constructive industrial service, must lead the in- 
dustrial worker to a higher knowledge and skill which will meet the 
demands of modern business life and give a sure, safe training in 
the essential qualities of good citizenship. 
The time has passed when it was thought necessary to ask whether 
the public schools should give industrial and vocational training, 
for we know now quite clearly that the public school should teach 
anything which functions into the lives of the people in a useful 
way. In the past we were perhaps too busily engaged in that educa- 
toin which prepared largely, if not entirely, for the various profes- 
oisns, and not enough interested in that education which directly 
connects with our industrial life. We now see the direct problem 
of the present, so far as secondary education is concerned, is to 
vitalize our high schools by the introduction, in a judicious manner, 
of forms of industrial education which reach the whole student body 
and make them feel it is just as honorable to make a mouse trap for 
the destruction of a pest as to rebuild Caesar’s bridge, to illustrate 
a fact in history, and as much value in making a hat rack as in con- 
structing images of the imagination. 
The value of industrial education is not to be determined by seek- 
ing to substitute it for the subject-matter which has long been con- 
sidered important in our educational life, but by the way in which 
it may reinforce and add to the value of the curriculum as it has 
been long in use. Some hoys and girls in every school will always 
need that education leading to the professions and some boys and 
girls in every school should be given the opportunity for that prepara- 
tion which leads to the vocations, not that they will study a trade 
direct, but that they may become skillful enough in general voca- 
tional subjects so as to apply that skill to special vocations in which 
they may desire to enter. 
The school must not only seek to serve the community practically, 
it must seek to elevate the community ideals. The future needs of 
the individual and the community must be looked after as well as 
their present demands. The school must seek to upbuild the com- 
munity through the individual. A complete program of studies 
should take into consideration the natural capabilities, inclinations, 
ambitions and aptitudes of the entire people who seek its offerings.  
-P-A-G-E-262
  262 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The type of education must function into the lives and industries of 
the community served by the institutions giving the educational 
opportunities. Not only is it essential to care for the boys and girls 
of a community, but it is necessary to foster and care for the in- 
dustries of the community. Both interests should be represented in 
the program of studies offered. 
Again, the field of vocational training is rapidly broadening until 
much work formerly done in school has become vocational, not so 
much by changing the nature of the instruction given as by a more 
definite realization of the purposes for which it is given. The once 
clear cut line between professional and vocational training is fast 
fading away and these two phases in educational effort are coalescing 
in a marvelous way. This also marks one of the recurrent values of 
industrial and vocational training. When we come to see more 
clearly than now the vocational value in general education and like- 
wise the cultural value in industrial training we will have a more 
comprehensive and correct view of the real aims and ideals of modern 
education. 
In this brief discussion of the valuation of industrial and voca- 
tional training it was not deemed advisable to discuss it from the 
viewpoint of the particular industries and vocations open to our 
young people today, but to argue it more directly as these subjects 
relate to the fundamental principles upon which a rational system 
of education should be based. With this relation more or less clearly 
outlined it becomes a simple matter to apply the principles dis- 
covered to the special field of industrial education. Nor was it 
thought necessary to cite concrete illustrations, as these may be 
easily supplied from experience when the connecting links have been 
established. 
To sum up this argument in brief statement of principles an- 
nounced herein is to say: 
ist. To ascertain the general value of a subject in the course of 
study we must ascertain how far it articulates with the life of the 
people to be served by it. 
2d. Nothing is of great value in a course of study which does not 
function directly into individual life of the people served by it. 
3d. That subject-matter in a course of study which connects the 
results obtained from it with the more permanent aspects of our 
civilized life is of greatest value. 
4th. Young people should become acquainted with the elementary 
facts of quite a variety of subjects in order to be able to form proper
-P-A-G-E-263
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 263 
mental habits in handling the fund of information which they will, 
later on, gather in connection with their special work. 
5th. Information with skill in application and power to accom- 
plish are the supreme motives in education irrespective of the field 
in which the individual may be called upon to apply his skill. 
6th. The recognition of the social interdependence of the pro- 
fessional and industrial education is a development of the new edu- 
cation on rational lines. 
7th. That the vocations are being called upon, through the schools, 
to render some distinctive service to society shows their recognized 
value in our scheme of educational readjustment. 
8th. Education should be adapted to life, but not always to 
environment. Education must enable the individual to improve his 
environment and frequently rise superior to it. 
9th, Education must continually readjust itself to a growing 
progressive civilization in order to be able to serve its day and genera- 
tion. 
10th. Industrial education is a paying investment, for “in the 
international struggle for commercial supremacy the balance must 
tip in favor of the land whose workers are most skillful and intelli- 
gent.” 
11th. It is a deep concern of society to equip the youth of today 
with the tools for earning a livelihood and to be economically effi- 
cient. 
12th. The ability of vocational education to fit the young for 
social as well as industrial efficiency is one test of its value. 
13th. Correct industrial training produces the artist as well as 
the artisan. It reserves for every child of industry his birthright for 
enjoyment and pleasure. 
14th. The problem in our secondary schools today is to revitalize 
the subject-matter of the curriculum by the judicious introduction of 
forms of educational activity which honor industry, dignify labor 
and discover cultural value in work well done. 
15th. The school must seek to serve the community in a practical 
way and must likewise upbuild its ideals. All subject-matter which 
takes into consideration the natural capabilities, aptitudes, ambitions 
and desires of the young people who seek its treasures and which 
serves the community life in a rational way is properly found in the 
program of studies.

MRS, HETTY S, BROWN, ROCK HILL, 8. C. 
I must assure you that the length of my subject is not indicative 
of the length of my paper. I am not going to try to discuss the 
problems of the rural school, although it is of such vital interest to 
me. It was discussed this morning, and is being discussed this after- 
noon, in a much better manner than I could ever do it. I am going 
to try to tell you in as straight forward and simple manner as pos- 
sible of our Experimental Rural High School at Winthrop College. 
Dr. A. P. Bourland of Washington, D. C., seeing the need of a 
school to train the future farmers and farm wives of the South, sug- 
gested to Dr. D. B. Johnson, President of Winthrop College, that 
such a school should be opened in connection with Winthrop Col- 
lege. Dr. Johnson had contemplated for some time the establish- 
ment of just such a school. Prof. W. K. Tate, Supervisor of Rural 
Schools of South Carolina, was thoroughly in sympathy with the 
plan proposed. These three agreed that to be effective, the work of 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 265 
the country school must be based on country life and activities. 
That there must be a closer union between the school and the home. 
That the school must be a vital force in the neighborhood. That 
the school must not only do its part toward keeping our boys and 
girls on the farm, but in making them more efiicient workers while 
there. Seeing the needs of the country child, they could decide on 
the education to meet these needs. They saw that his growth must 
be natural and not forced. Having selected a teacher, they did not 
hamper her with details, but left her to live the life of a country 
housewife and farmer with the children. They always stood ready 
to help and advise, and she felt that their sympathy was hers be- 
fore she asked for it. I am the teacher selected to take charge of 
this school, and I wish to say that I have never had more delightful 
work. It is a pleasure to teach as one’s conscience dictates. 
The school has been in session a little over sixteen months. There 
have been two summer vacations. We opened school March 15, 1911. 
We decided to start with no preconceived notions of a school; 
no desks, in fact, nothing that smacked of the ordinary school- 
room. Professor Bourland had suggested a house and furniture like 
that of a well-to-do farmer. We acted on his suggestion and found 
a house near the campus which would answer our purpose. As it 
had been used as a dwelling, there were roses and other flowers, as 
well as shrubs, growing around it. These, with the vines, gave the 
place an inviting, homelike appearance. Around the house, shad- 
ing and sheltering it, were fruit trees. A mulberry and two Caro- 
lina poplars also helped to beautify the grounds. With a little 
work by the college carpenter, the house was soon ready for our use. 
We decided to fit up three rooms. The first was furnished some- 
what like a sitting room. The center of attraction here was a long 
table with a burlap cover, on which the following books were tempt- 
ingly displayed: “Mother Goose Nursery Tales,” “Mother Goose 
Nursery Rhymes,” “Pinafore Palace,” “Fairy Tales’—Grim; “Fairy 
Tales”—Lang; “The Children’s Own Book”—Scudder; “Pilgrim’s 
Progress,” “Robinson Crusoe,” “Pinocchio,” “Nursery Tales and 
Fables,” “Aesop’s Fables,” “Stories of the Vikings”—Lang; “Popu- 
lar Tales from the Norse.” 
There were several copies of some of these books. Others have 
been added as we found that the children demanded them. Artistic 
curtains of ecru scrim were so hung as to soften the outlines of the 
windows while not obstructing the light. On a broad shelf in 
front of a group of three windows were placed pots of plants, 
which added to the cheerful home-like appearance of the room. On  
-P-A-G-E-266
  266. SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
some plain shelves were placed writing materials, drawing mate- 
rials, scissors, and clay for modeling. Here, too, were thimbles, 
needles, thread, tape, etc. Some plain chairs completed the furnish- 
ings of this room. 
The next room we furnished as a simple carpenter’s shop, with 
two benches, one bought, the other made by the college carpenter ; 
as well as with saws, hammers, hatchets, a chisel, square and a brace 
and bit. 
The third room was to be our kitchen. In this we placed a big 
coal range with a number of small utensils for cooking. In a cup- 
board were dishes to be used in serving. Two tables, pails for water, 
etc., were here also. 
On the veranda, near the pump, we hung our drinking cups, 
one for each child. This veranda made an ideal outdoor school- 
room, and there were few times during the past winter that we 
could not spend several hours here daily. 
Fortunately for our plan, there was enough ground attached to 
the house for a large garden, besides a field. We also found enough 
room for a generous playground for the children. The soil of the 
garden and field was broken and made ready for the children. 
The school opened in March. As no country children were avail- 
able, we got our children from a cotton mill village near by, as well 
as a few from the college campus. 
The first thing the teacher did when the children came was to 
show them the house. She next led the way to the garden. The 
children were delighted when told that each one was to have a 
garden of his own. The garden was made the center of activity, 
and has never failed in being a source of delight and instruction for 
both teacher and pupils. Even as I write this in my vacation, I have 
a letter from one of the girls in which she says: “I miss my garden.” 
We had a tool room to keep the necessary garden tools, wheel-hoes- 
plows, as the children proudly called them; rakes, hoes, trowels, etc. 
Both teacher and pupils felt an intense longing to get to work 
in the garden. A three-foot walk had been laid off, extending down 
the middle of the garden. The individual gardens were to be. laid 
off on either side of this. By measuring it was found to be forty 
feet on either side from the walk to the fence. It was decided to 
let this determine the length of the garden. The width was the next 
question. In their zeal the children proposed very large gardens, 
but the teacher limited the width to seven feet. A walk one foot 
wide separated the small gardens.

We found trouble in getting the sides of our garden straight. One 
boy suggested that his father used a garden line to get his rows 
straight. He told us how it was made, and under his direction we 
each made one. We got two stakes and having sharpened the ends 
wound one stake with twine and attached the loose end of the twine 
to the other stake. We thus had a crude but good garden line. 
After much measuring, the gardens were laid off and each farmer 
began proudly to dig and rake, getting his garden ready for the 
seed. 
The next morning some of the children had forgotten which gar- 
den had been assigned them. The teacher had to get the plan that 
she had made the day before to settle the difficulty. How to pre- 
vent this occurring every day was the problem. Why, we must 
mark them, Good; but how? After talking the matter over we 
decided to make a wooden stake and to print the owner’s name 
on the stake. Each child was encouraged to go to the blackboard 
and with a ruler make a drawing of the way he thought the stake 
should look. After this, the teacher and pupils considered the plans, 
and each child was allowed to tell why he had made his stake in 
a certain way. All agreed that it should be in the form of a cross, 
and that the cross-piece should be long enough to contain the own- 
er’s name, and that the upright piece should be long enough to be 
driven firmly into the ground. The width of each piece was con- 
sidered, and it was decided that the upright piece should be two 
inches by eigheen inches, and the cross-piece three inches by twelve 
inches. An old dry goods box furnished the lumber. It was broken 
in pieces and the work began in earnest, measuring, sawing and 
nailing. 
The children had to do a good bit of thinking for themselves; for 
example, to find the center of the cross-piece in order to nail it prop- 
erly to the upright one. The younger children were shown how to 
take a piece of paper the exact length of the piece of which they 
wished to find the middle, and to fold in the middle. Of course, 
they were curious to know how long each piece of paper really was, 
and measured it for themselves. They found that each half was 
six inches. In this way they began to get a good idea of what is 
meant by one-half. 
Some drill in printing was necessary before the children could at- 
tempt printing the name on the stake. Oblongs, the exact size of 
the cross-piece, were drawn on the blackboard, and the children 
practiced printing their names in these, using as a model the teach- 
er’s copy. When a child had gained sufficient skill in printing his 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
  268 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION, 
name on the blackboard, he printed it with pencil on his stake and 
then went over the pencil marks with black paint. The end of the 
upright piece having been sharpened with a hatchet, he went proudly 
into the garden and drove it into place. When all the stakes were 
finished and in place, teacher and pupils viewed their work with 
pride and satisfaction. 
That night a heavy rain came. Our stakes stood the test bravely, 
but our paths were all obliterated. Where did each garden begin 
and where end? We must have three more stakes and mark all 
four corners of the garden. They went bravely to work and soon 
had these completed and driven into place. Only straight stakes 
were made this time. Hach was two inches by eighteen inches. 
In all of this work the teacher was pleased to see how eager the 
older children were to help the younger. With a few suggestions 
from the teacher they learned to really help them to do the work in- 
stead of doing it for them. 
While all this was going on in the garden, the more formal studies 
had not been neglected. The children had been learning to read and 
to write and to do various other things. For their first reading and 
writing lesson they had: “I have a garden”; “Carrie has a garden,” 
etc. Other words were added, and a vocabulary built up. 
The older children were encouraged to select books for themselves 
and to read either to themselves or to a group of others. 
There was a daily social period in the pleasantest part of the ve- 
randa. The pupils all brought their chairs and placed them in a 
circle. At this time the older children told what they had read. 
But it was not confined to the older ones alone. Each child was 
expected to tell a story, repeat a rhyme, give a riddle or do some- 
thing for the entertainment of all. This was where the teacher de- 
lighted in telling the fine old stories which are a child’s birthright. 
The children were encouraged in attempts at dramatizing the 
stories, and all had good times together playing “Chicken Little,” 
“The Three Bears,” “Billy Goats Gruff,” etc. The Mother Goose 
Rhymes were a source of great pleasure at this time, too. From a 
good copy of Mother Goose the teacher would read the rhymes, the 
children repeating with her any with which they were familiar. 
The household duties also formed part of the regular program of 
the day. On reaching school, the children ran to the blackboard 
in the kitchen to see what duties had been assigned them for the day. 
The teacher had written on the blackboard something like this: 
Wash and hang up cups—Nell and Aggie. 
Bring water—Jessie and McIver.
-P-A-G-E-269
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 269 
Fill kettles—Lawrence and Carrie. 
Cut flowers—Estelle. 
Arrange flowers—Wilma and Bennie. 
Dust—Mamie. 
Tend fire—John. 
Arrange books—Nellie May. 
Open and arrange carpenter shop—Conlie. 
Tidy up kitchen—Maggie. 
Dust erasers—Charlie and Willie. 
As soon as the child found what duty had been assigned to him 
he went to work. When this was done, he got a book and read, 
went to work in the carpenter shop or garden, or got his sewing 
and went to work on that. 
All was done naturally, just as a child should do his work in his 
own home. Children were allowed to talk in an ordinary tone of 
voice when it did not disturb some one else. Bruce wanted to know 
if he might whistle while he sawed. He was told that he might. 
The question of discipline took care of itself. All were busy and 
happy. ‘The teacher’s part was to help the children and not to dic- 
tate to them. 
In all of our work we tried to make only those things of which 
we felt the need. The garden lines and stakes were made when 
there was a demand for them. We soon found that we must have tow- 
els. After working in the gardens our hands were soiled. We could 
wash them at the pump, but we needed something on which to dry 
them. Suppose each one hems a towel. The towel was planned 
and necessary goods determined. The cost of the goods was also 
worked out. Our number work was always combined in this way 
with our sewing. The care of the towels called for lessons in sim- 
ple laundering. 
“When are you going to cook?” was the question asked daily for 
the first few days. Before we cook me must understand our range. 
The children know the names of most of the parts of the range and 
their uses, but they do not understand the drafts, so a fire was built 
and a few simple experiments made. They learned that a fire has 
to have air, how the stove is constructed to allow the air to get to 
the fire, and how the fire is conducted to the parts of the stove one 
wishes heated. Kettle tea was the first thing made. It was served 
with the children’s lunch. As all gathered round the table on the 
veranda, the teacher caught a glimpse of the value of serving the 
warm lunch daily—not only from a hygienic standpoint, but from 
the social side as well. Later, the children paid ten cents a week  
-P-A-G-E-270
  270 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
or brought the equivalent in produce from home, and the warm 
lunches were served daily. The children prepared the lunch, with 
the help of the teacher, and the pleasantest part of the day was 
the lunch time. All gathered about the table, a simple grace was 
said, and the meal progressed in an orderly manner. Valuable les- 
sons were given in the proper serving of the various foods, and in 
the proper eating of them. There was a flow of conversation, riddles 
were asked, and short rhymes and good stories were told. As the 
vegetables planted in the garden grew, they formed part of the 
daily lunch. 
But we must return to the garden. It was there that a part of 
the time was spent every day. The gardens were planted as quickly 
as possible. It was getting late in the spring, and very little time 
could be given just now to the studying of the soil or the germina- 
tion of the seeds. We planted onions, turnips, radishes, lettuce, po- 
tatoes, peas, beets, corn, beans, okra, and tomatoes, somewhat in 
the order that I have mentioned them. 
Each child kept a garden book, in which a record of the planting 
of each of these vegetables, their fertilization, cultivation and 
growth was made. At the front of the book there was a plan of 
the garden made very simply by the younger children and drawn 
to a scale by the older ones. 
Peanuts and popcorn were planted later. These were harvested 
in the fall when the children returned to school. 
There were four months of school. It opened in March and closed 
in July. In the fall we opened with real country children in addi- 
tion to the ones we already had. We found that these knew very 
few games. Some games had been taught in the spring, but the new 
ones did not fall naturally into the playing of these. The teacher 
found that she must teach them some games and make them as at- 
tractive as possible. She took an active part in the games, and now 
all enjoy playing. 
One of the chief reasons that our boys and girls leave the farm is 
that they have so little recreation. To supply this lack we had a 
party every month, to which the home folks were invited. The first 
one was at Hallowe’en. We decorated our rooms with autumn 
leaves. The boys brought pumpkins, of which we made Jack o’ Lan- 
terns. These, with a roaring fire in the fireplace, gave all the light 
we needed. When the guests arrived we popped corn over the coals, 
bobbed for apples, tried to bite an apple suspended from the ceiling 
by a cord, and did other things peculiarly fitting for Hallowe’en. 
The refreshments consisted of popcorn, roasted peanuts and apples.

The first two came from our own garden, and the latter was bought 
with the money we had earned from the sale of a peck of potatoes 
from our garden. Some circle games learned during the month gave 
a finishing touch to our Hallowe’en party. 
I give this as a typical party. In November we had a Thanks- 
giving dinner, in December a Christmas tree, in January we cele- 
brated Lee’s birthday, in February we had a Valentine party, and 
so on through all of the school months. 
I have tried to tell you the purpose we had in mind in starting 
this school; of our house and its simple furniture; of the really 
experimental way in which we made our beginning; of how the 
work progressed; having made the garden the center of activity, 
how the other activities were brought in. The need for stakes sent 
us to the carpenter shop; the need for towels set us to sewing; the 
need for warm lunch and to prepare vegetables raised in our gar- 
dens sent us to the kitchen; and the need for recreation set us to 
playing games and caused us to give our monthly parties. The 
more formal studies were combined with the activities. In describ- 
ing the making of the garden stakes I gave some idea of the amount 
of drill that we got in numbers; in the sewing, too, I have shown 
how we combined our work in numbers. There was opportunity for 
quite a variety of such work in our cooking lessons. Writing came 
in naturally to help the child keep a record of the work done in the 
garden; a book of recipes learned in cooking, etc. The children were 
given drill in reading by having directions written on the black- 
board, and by the teacher writing on the blackboard an account 
of something interesting that had occurred during the day. The 
children were encouraged to write such descriptions for themselves, 
and so, unconsciously, they were learning language. The drawing 
lessons were vitally connected with all of the work done. I shall 
close with a quotation from Augustine Birrell. He says: “Educa- 
tion is one great process, ’tis a pity to chop it up. It is a process 
whereby the mind and body are trained to perform useful purposes.”

Minutes of the Meeting of the Department of Kindergarten 
Education. 
The Department of Kindergarten Education held its meeting in 
the Girls’ High School, at 2:00 vp. m., November 27, 1912. Miss Hor- 
tense Orcutt of Savannah, Ga., presiding in the absence of the Pres- 
ident. Miss Edwina Wood of Columbus, Ga., was asked to act as 
Secretary. On account of the failure of several of our speakers to 
reach Louisville, the program was given with several changes. Dr. 
Leonard Ayers of New York was the first speaker, his subject being, 
“Health and Education.” 
Next was the Round Table, conducted by Miss Mary Hill, Louis- 
vills, Ky., the subject being, “How the Kindergarten Prepares for 
Primary.” Following her paper came the following discussions: (a) 
Miss Louise Dietz, Supervisor of Primary Grades, Louisville, Ky. 
(b) Miss Caroline Bourgard, Supervisor of Music, Louisville, Ky. 
(c) Mrs. Robert Allen, Critic and Training Teacher in Kentucky 
Department Normal School, Louisville, Ky. (d) Miss Alice C. Por- 
ter, Critic Teacher, First Grade, Normal School, Louisville, Ky. 
Last on the program was the address of Dr. Carolyn Geisel, Bat- 
tle Creek, Mich., on the “Need of Preparation for Parenthood.” Dr. 
Geisel, owing to hours of delay on the road, was not present at the 
beginning of the meeting, and the discusions on her subject had to 
be omitted.

How tHe Music In THE KINDERGARTEN May Prepare FoR PRIMARY 
INSTRUCTION. 
MISS CAROLINE BOURGARD, LOUISVILLE, KY. 
It has been authoritatively stated that a child of six years has 
already acquired more knowledge than a student in his whole uni- 
versity course. The kindergarten period, if it is to function as a 
preparatory stage to the primary music course, must therefore fur- 
nish ample opportunity for the acquisition of musical experience. 
Since the little child’s faculties are assimilative, absorbing uncon- 
sciously almost without discrimination, it is essential that the musi- 
cal environment be the object of parents’ and teachers’ constant care. 
The human mind is like a sponge in absorbtive power, but unlike 
in retaining the impression made. This is so well understood by 
the leaders of a certain religious order that they are satisfied to 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 273 
control the education of children up to the age of seven. It is just 
as certain that the music which a child hears in these early years 
will determine the musical bent and taste all through life. 
The subconscious impressions of these years are as vital and de- 
terminative upon the future character as the background of a pic- 
ture is to the figures in it. They give to life’s pictures its distinctive 
atmosphere. The sounds which the child is accustomed to hear and 
tolerates, the type of music with which he comes in contact, will 
determine what kind of music he will choose, like and understand 
when grown. 
In view of these facts, the need of the kindergarten teacher’s 
careful musical training is apparent. For adequate equipment she 
needs vocal training for both speaking and singing. It may be ques- 
tioned whether the kindergartner fully realizes the influence of her 
voice in speaking as well as in singing. She may always hear it 
truthfully reflected by her class. 
Secondly, a knowledge of the child voice, correct methods of treat- 
ment and the ability to sing with head quality in order to give ex- 
amples for imitation are essential. 
How singular that the study of the child voice has heretofore been 
totally neglected by the public school teachers, when the human 
voice is one of the most precious gifts to man, one of the most pow- 
erful agencies for influence in commercial, social and professional 
life, and considering, too, that the vocal apparatus is very delicate 
and easily trained. 
Teachers who are most assiduous in studying the best methods of 
treating the child properly along physical, intellectual and moral 
lines, give no thought to scientific training of the child voice, and 
allow incorrect vocal action without regard to the harmful results 
which inevitably follow. Right voice use ensures not only the most 
charming purity and sweetness of tone quality, but also immunity 
from disease. 
The ethereal beauty of the child voice is almost unknown, for 
children, by virtue of their imitative powers, will try to sing like 
their elders if left unguided, producing the blatant, strident tones so 
familiar to all. Not only are children’s voices ofttimes ruined, or 
at least rendered unfit for future training, but undue strain and the 
use of the wrong muscles cause disease more or less dangerous and 
lasting. 
Composers of children’s songs almost without exception seem to 
have written with the adult voice in mind, for their songs are 
18
-P-A-G-E-274
  274 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
pitched too low, and often without regard to the use of tones which 
lie well in the child voice. The child voice is entirely distinct from 
the adult voice, having its own limitations and possibilities, but 
when correctly produced, such transcendent beauty, that those who 
understand a proper training have bitterly denounced what they 
term public school singing. 
I have known vocal teachers with only a knowledge of the adult 
voice calmly undertake to train children’s voices. 
Thirdly, the kindergarten teacher needs careful training in the 
use of the piano. And just here, it might be proper to express an 
emphatic protest against the too prevalent notion that for begin- 
ners any old tuneless instrument and a cheap teacher will answer. 
It should be remembered that the first impressions are the ones that 
count. Good results should be attainable when two kindergarten 
teachers work together, if one acted as accompanist, while the other 
directed the singing, instead of allowing the children to drag after 
the piano at will. 
If you think this course too exacting, watch the little ones playing 
mother, or teacher, or band master, and see what implicit prompt 
obedience is demanded by the mimic leader and how cheerfully the 
others respond. 
It seems to me that a high degree of virtuosity, though desirable, is 
not so essential in piano playing as the development of real music 
feeling, an understanding of musical form or structure, the syntax of 
music, with sufficient technique to express artistically the meaning 
and beauty of the songs. The teacher needs a more thorough knowl- 
edge of rythm and an understanding of its use as one of the most 
important factors in education. Irregular rythm, such as ragtime, 
not only degrades the moral and esthetic nature, but is injurious to 
health, 
The kindergartener can render real service to primary music 
study by establishing a strong but correct feeling of rythm. This 
means ability to correctly interpret the rythm in piano playing. The 
rendition of the music used for rythmic development in the active 
songs has often seemed to lack artistic, refined quality and well-de- 
fined accent. 
It may be impracticable to make any change, but it is certain that 
in the singing games and active songs the singing becomes harsh, 
bringing into play incorrect vocal action. If it is not feasible to 
have the teacher or a group of children take the singing, the songs 
should at least be pitched high enough to compel the use of head

    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 275 
tones. The combination of singing with vigorous hody movements is 
to be deprecated. Some systematic ear training would serve as a 
most valuable preparation for primary work. 
Our first grades show a large number of children who are unable 
to distinguish tone differences and who, for lack of a better term, are 
called monotones. These children are much more susceptible to 
training in the first than in the second grades, and after that time 
are almost hopeless. This indicates that ear stimulation should 
be given as soon as possible. 
Just as the child is encouraged by parents and kindergarten 
teacher to observe differences in size and color, so should the ear be 
stimulated to detect tone differences as to high and low, loud and 
soft, long and short sounds. This can be done interestingly with 
the piano or the voice, and by calling attention to sounds which chil- 
dren can hear, viz.: Sounds of animals, birds, bells, whistles, etc. 
Since the mental appeal in these early years is largely by way of 
the ear gate, parents and teachers should realize the serious handi- 
cap of a slow or defective aural perception to educational progress. 
These suggestions summarized are: 
1. Adequate musical training of kindergarten teachers. 
2. A knowledge of the child voice and correct methods of teaching. 
3. Listening—for gaining musical experience and establishing a 
love for good music. 
4, Ear training—for mental alertness. 
5. Development of normal rythmic feeling. 
6. Elimination of monotones. 
7. The codperation of parents, who should be urged to give the 
best possible musical environment in the home. 
How tHe KINDERGARTEN PREPARES FOR THH PRIMARY. 
MISS MARY D. HILL, LOUISVILLE, KY. 
Our subject for discussion seems to divide itself into three heads: 
First, what the kindergarten is now doing along this line; second, 
what further should it do; third, what are the ways and means of 
bringing about these needed modifications? 
Froebel says that “vigorous and complete development and culti- 
vation of each successive stage depends on the vigorous, complete 
and characteristic development of each and all preceding stages of 
life. The child, the boy, the man, indeed, should know no other en- 
deavor but to be at every stage of development wholly what this 
stage calls for.”
-P-A-G-E-276
    276 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
To a marked degree, the kindergarten teacher has studied the 
child from four to six years, intensively, and has, therefore, to a cer- 
tain extent, planned her work to develop him along lines charac- 
teristic of his stage. But I believe we have partially overlooked an- 
other equally important Froebellian principle; that of continuity 
of development; that we must “treat the child with reference to all 
stages of development and age without breaks and omissions.” If 
the kindergartner fails to realize that there must be continuity of de- 
devolpment, then there follows as a necessary consequence, the much 
discussed break or gap between the kindergarten and the first grade. 
Equally, however, must the first grade teacher realize this need of 
continuity, so she may foster the growth of the kindergarten child 
when he comes to her. 
In everyday language, we need more than anything else to get to- 
gether, we kindergarten and primary teachers, to plan our work to- 
gether, each standing staunchly for the special needs of the stage 
of development of her own children, but each modifying in the light 
of the need of the continuity of their development. As Dr. Dewey 
says, “If we are to train even the young child, we must know the 
final outcome in higher education, as well as our own simple begin- 
nings.” The art of a Corot is none too great for the teacher of young 
children. So we teachers of different grades must exemplify the 
spirit of the twentieth century, which is is said to be codperation. 
Thus the gaps will gradually disappear, and also there will be no 
necessity for sacrificing the child for any superficial, so-called prep- 
aration for the next grade. Froebel says, “Then will each succes- 
sive stage spring like a new shoot from a healthy bud.” 
So much for generalities which are easy to deal with, but now for 
the concrete situation, which is more difficult. As President Cleve- 
land once said, “We are facing a condition, not a theory.” The 
speakers down for the discussion of our subject will deal with this 
more difficult phase of it. But in closing I would like to give some 
of our recent experiences in Louisville, since it has been possible 
for the kindergarten to codperate closely with other departments. 
1st—We have mapped out a few definite things which we are to 
give to our first grade teachers as our brief course of study. This 
represents only a small part of our work, but we kindergarten 
teachers have all agreed to work definitely upon them. 
2d—We receive the bulletins and plans and courses of study sent 
out by our special supervisors. 
3d—We attend the meeting of these supervisors with their pri- 
mary teachers.
-P-A-G-E-277
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 277 
4th—We are recording for ourselves and our principals only, the 
progress of our five-year-olds each month. These records are to be 
the basis of promotion to the first grade. In this record we have 
no general habits, such as that of inattention, memory, etc. Our 
psychologists tell us these do not exist in géneral form, but only 
as specific habits. Our children six, or nearly six, can enter the 
first grade without promotion, but we can use our influence with the 
principal and parent, if we genuinely feel that five months more 
would feed the child better than first grade work. 
The more I see of teaching in a modern first grade, the more I see 
the possibilities of slight modification of kindergarten work to make 
progress in his first grade easier for the child. We can do the same 
thing we have been doing, but do it a little differently. Example: 
Blackboard drawing for arm movement only, by standing back 
from the board, making a little game of standing on the line. Some 
of our teachers’ conferences have been given to a systematic study 
of the best methods of directing two separate graded groups under 
one teacher, just as the first grade teacher must do. This plan 
proved quite profitable, as it made us skillful in this line, and has 
led to a growing independence in the children, for we have trained 
one group to work alone, after a few directions, while we give 
most of our attention and teaching to the other. 
We will now proceed to a discussion of this subject by those who 
have made a special study of it, each in her own department. 
Wauat THE Kinprrearten Is Done to Prepare FoR THE PRIMARY. 
MRS. R. D. ALLEN, LOUISVILLE, KY. 
To determine what and how the kindergarten can best prepare 
for the primary, it is well to find out what phases of the kindergar- 
ten curriculum are continued in the primary grades. Upon investi- 
gation it is found that the two can meet upon common ground in 
every subject, the process in handling the subjects constituting a 
sum in addition, not subtraction. 
The primary teacher receives the kindergarten child with a cer- 
tain intelligence and manual equipment, upon which she can build 
immediately without much preliminary preparation. Her contri- 
bution to child education takes up necessarily some formal and ab- 
stract aspects that are entirely foreign and unnecessary to a child 
not yet six years old. Familiarity with subjects should help, not 
hinder, provided they are presented in a vital, living way. The lit- 
tle child, unlike the adult, does not exhaust any subject during
-P-A-G-E-278
  278 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
his limited stay in the kindergarten, but always finds some new 
truth upon which to feed, through a familiar subject. He meets an 
old friend in a new, strange environment, and meets him more than 
half way in a cordial, spontaneous and willing way. 
What is the kindergarten doing with these subjects, art, manual 
or industrial work, nature work, stories, songs, rhythms, games, 
numbers, English, domestic science, social, spiritual and moral 
phases, so as to give the primary teacher a good working basis to 
build upon? 
The kindergarten child is in the pre-art stage, so we can not ex- 
pect any art results in drawing, painting and modeling. If the race 
parallel holds good here, the kindergarten child is in the pictograph 
stage. He draws in outline to tell a story. His drawing has a social 
purpose. He repeats a drawing again and again to tell the same 
story, not to get skill, or good art results. The drawing has served its 
purpose in the telling of the story. The skillful teacher at each re- 
newed effort helps the child to master just those details which are 
the high watermark of that particular age. She takes what the 
child can contribute and helps him to step higher, never indulging 
an interest, but developing it. 
Mr. Walter Sargent believes that painting as art should be post- 
poned to the third grade. But there are opportunities for large 
surface washes and daubings to satisfy the child’s natural love for 
these activities, and at the same time get skill in handling these 
tools, and this medium. The little child loves a great deal of color, 
and such subjects as the pumpkin, large colored Christmas balls, 
the green grass and blue sky, painted church windows and lanterns, 
calcimining the walls of doll houses, ete., will satisfy the child’s 
craving for much and vivid color, and lead him to the right use of 
true color, and the correct use of the brush, without making too 
great demands on his power of inhibition and control. 
Through observation, comparison and selection, the child learns to 
discriminate and judge form and color expressions. Through func- 
tional use of color, the kindergarten child enters the primary with 
at least a speaking acquaintance with the six standard colors and 
the neutral colors. I might say right here that I do not believe 
that the box paints have a place in the kindergarten. The tube 
paints seem to me much more correct, useful and satisfactory. De- 
signs made up of simple elements, forms of beauty that are life 
forms, and forms of symmetry and balance find their place in the 
kindergarten. So the little child has gotten a certain skill in ar-

Too much cannot be said of work with clay in the kindergarten. 
It seems to be the art material par excellence for the little child. 
Through every step in experimentation, pounding, rolling, flatten- 
ing, moulding, etc., to the representations of all kinds of fruits, veg- 
etables, nuts, etc., this plastic material responds immediately to 
every desire of the child with only slight effort on his part. The 
kindergarten child goes to the primary with experiences in modeling 
these forms and household articles and a certain skill in manipu- 
lating this medium to express his ideas. 
The industrial materials consist of cotton and wool fabrics of 
various kinds, wood, paper, cardboard, leatherette and native pick- 
up materials, such as spools, spool boxes, ribbon rolls, ete. The 
child learns in his two-year stay in the kindergarten to handle with 
some degree of skill and accuracy the scissors and hammer. He 
learns to fold and cut on line. For example, the sixteen-inch fold 
and the box form with simple modifications, he can make without 
detailed direction. There are some processes that he owns and | 
they are ready for use in his new environment. ! 
He becomes quite dextrous in handling blocks, and incidentally 
uses numbers as far as ten. He counts functionally with concretes. 
He measures, and numbers are again used functionally, but inci- 
dentally. 
The kindergarten and two primary grades use practically the 
same nature subjects. These necessarily overlap, but it is well that 
they do. For some years past we have divided our nature subjects 
under three heads: nature observations, nature experiences and 
nature experiments. Whatever can be made a part of the living ex- 
periences of the child, helps him to see and know intelligently. Na- 
ture observations and experiments concerning the weather are daily 
arranged for him. So he has some definite knowledge of the where- 
abouts of the sun in the morning, about the moon and stars, rain, 
frost, snow, ice, the sleeping plants and bulbs in winter, the use of 
leaves and snow as a warm covering for plants, new life in the 
spring, germination of seeds, etc.; all these as they touch upon and 
affect his life. 
Bread is made before him with his help, and flour he traces to the 
mill, the wheat seed, stalk and field. The whole process of butter 
making he attends to, from the skimming of the milk, the churning, 
moulding, ete., to the finished product, which he enjoys in the “tast- 
ing and eating thereof.” He makes jelly from fruits, plants vege- 
tables whenever possible, and these are traced in the same way to 
the orchard and garden as a real experience.
-P-A-G-E-280

Wool and cotton clothing and fuel are also traced as far back as 
possible to make it a part of a present experience. Excursions to 
see the squirrels and bees at work are also a part of the kinder- 
garten plan. A visit to a friendly neighbor who has a cow or horse 
shows man’s care and forethought for the animals that serve him. 
The climax of these gifts from the Divine Giver is the hymn of 
gratitude for all His blessings, and the child carries this with him 
into his new school home. 
Not voice culture, but songs expressive of ideas belong’ also to the 
little child. He often bubbles over into little song phrases in his 
moments of happy interest, and these are combined into a song for 
him. About ten songs have been selected for the children to carry 
over into the primary. The simple, natural, fundamental rythms, 
such as walking, running, hopping, clapping, skipping, etc., all un- 
der control to music, and combined into simple games, ten in num- 
ber, are also among the assets of the kindergarten child. These 
make the transition to the first grade easy, natural and happy, doing 
away with the strangeness that makes so many children timid and 
self-conscious. 
Besides Mother Goose rhymes, with good content to suit a kin- 
dergarten program, the child learns some really good verse. Ten 
long stores have been selected which the child learns through hear- 
ing, as the race child did. A particular version has been selected, 
and when the child enters the primary, these same stories are given 
to him to learn to read. The kindergarten child has formed a habit 
of involuntary attention and concentration in hearing these simple 
stories, and the habit of listening and deducing. Sometimes he can 
reproduce these stories verbally, and thus he owns a good literary 
form as well as content. Little lessons in English have been ar- 
ranged, through a game of what “I saw” as I came to kindergarten, 
and the almost hopeless “I seen” is in danger of dying out. 
There are some important specific habits that we try to establish 
in the kindergarten child that will be of value to him all through 
life, but are particularly valuable to the primary teacher. These are 
the habits of punctuality, regularity, group obedience to laws, 
cleanliness and orderliness, which are a part of his daily domestic 
science training in good housekeeping, self-control, self-dependence, 
helpfulness, consideration for others, cheerfulness, listening intel- 
ligently to concrete suggestions and directions, observing and de- 
scribing intelligently, The social spirit is fostered during their 
lunch period and games, and spiritual and moral training are daily 
in evidence. |

Most of this has been an experiment of the past year, and one 
primary teacher will tell you how useful she has found it. 
Though this carefully selected and limited curriculum is used in 
every kindergarten in this city, because they meet the needs of 
every child in every environment, there is ample opportunity and 
freedom for the teacher to select and use whatever will best meet 
the needs of her particular children in that particular environment. 
Tue RELATION or KINDERGARTEN TO PRIMARY. 
MISS ALICE C. PORTER, LOUISVILLE, KY. 
Many of our children must leave school and take their places 
among wage-earners at the early age of fourteen. It has been de- 
cided that six years is the best age for a child to begin the grade 
work. In order that he may get the benefit of the full graded course 
in the few years allowed him for an education, a child must come 
to the first primary grade well equipped for the formal work of the 
school. Comparatively few mothers have either the time or the 
ability to prepare their little ones for this work. They do not rec- 
ognize the educational value of play, and of the dominance of the 
constructive instinct in human nature. They have little, if any, 
knowledge of the natural impulses of their children. 
This sort of education the kindergarten has supplied. It stands 
for the spiritual, mental and physical development of the child. Be- 
fore a child can be taught to read, he must be taught to understand 
and speak. Before he can be taught to write, he must acquire mus- 
eular control. He cannot do systematic and definite number work 
until he has had opportunity to express his natural impulses in 
rhythmic counting. The kindergarten has taken hold of the idea of 
motivation of all activities, and by its methods has laid a firm foun- 
dation on which the primary school should build. 
To help put this foundation principle of self-activity into practice, 
the kindergarten has introduced occupations of various kinds. The 
blocks or gifts are splendid material to be used actively by the chil- 
dren in expressing their own impressions. Children instinctively 
love to build. Given a number of blocks, almost any child will begin 
to pile one upon another. 
For ten minutes every morning before the ringing of the bell for 
opening, my pupils are allowed to play with boxes of wooden inclr 
cubes that have been provided. At first they repeated the construc- 
tion of houses, towers, bridges, boats, ets., that they had learned in 
the kindergarten; then by the suggestion of one child, their work 
turned to the laying of squares, rectangles and prisms. Next, I

found them counting by twos, by fours, by fives and by sevens. As 
long as the interest holds, I shall not find it necessary to plan for 
any other lessons in mathematics. I hope to see some attempts at 
designing soon. Clay modeling of fruits and animals gives full rein 
to the imagination, and this, with paper-cutting, helps to gain mus- 
cular control of the hand and arm. Illustrative drawing with cray- 
ons, and later, some water-color work, trains both the hand and eye. 
I have lately made some experiments of the muscular control of 
my pupils, using the form board, and I find the kindergarten chil- 
dren far surpass other children in this respect. Their accuracy in 
characteristic form-expression is much better. They observe more 
intelligently. 
Another contribution of the kindergarten to the primary is the 
content side of language and reading. The foundation of literary 
taste and a sense of rythm is laid by the nursery rhymes and 
jingles which the teacher repeats and sings to her pupils. Short 
poems, simple stories in prose, and singing games, a few myths, 
folk tales and fables feed the infant. By imitation and repetition, 
these soon become familiar to him, and he has begun to acquire not 
only language, but literary culture. 
With this sense of harmony, and the context of a variety of literary 
productions, he comes to the primary, where his development must be 
carried on by helping him to react upon his fund of materials. The 
stories, rhymes, etc., are utilized as thought for formal reading and 
language lessons, dramatization, free-hand cutting, drawing and 
modelling. Standards of beautiful language may be set up by the 
teacher if the material is tactfully handled. The child learns to read 
indirectly, keeping in mind the association of ideas. When he sees 
his oral productions converted into short stories on the board he has 
a desire to read them, thus his visual activity is awakened, and the 
habit of sentence grasp is begun. He has a genuine motive. From 
the stories in script he soon has a desire to read “The Little Red 
Hen,” Chicken Little,” etc., from a book, especially when he finds a 
picture (the same one he drew or cut) in the book. Mental activity 
cannot drag, because the child has been set in the midst of what has 
become his own material. 
I have not mentioned the most valuable material the kindergarten 
gives to the primary, and that is the ethical training. His attention 
has been turned away from self to others. He is taught to respect 
the rights of his playmates, which tends to generate social interests. 
He has learned to work in groups. There is a spiritual preparedness 
that is an inspiration to the primary teacher, and, best of all, the 
children are happy.

A meeting of the Department of Industrial Education was held in 
Louisville, Ky., November 29, 1912, in the Girls’ High School lunch 
room. In the absence of the President, Dr. W. B. Bizzell, the meet-

The election of officers for 1912-13 resulted in a choice of Dr. T. W. 
Palmer, President of the Girls’ Technical Institute, Montevallo, Ala., 
for President; and Miss M. Katherine Christian, Supervisor House- 
hold Arts, Public Schools, Lexington, Ky., for Secretary. 
There was a discussion of the need of a magazine which should 
bear the same relation to the teachers of home economics as the 
Manual Training Magazine bears to the teachers of that subject. On 
motion of Professor Dimmitt, Director of Department of Industrial 
Education, Birmingham, Ala., the chair appointed Miss Christian, of 
Lexington; Rodgers, of Louisville, and Miss Sweeney, of the State 
University of Kentucky, to look into the feasibility of conducting 
such a magazine.

Possipititins oF Homn Economics as A Muans or CorReLATION AND 
CoNSERVATION IN THE Pustic ScHoot CurRICULUM. 
M,. KATHERINE CHRISTIAN, LEXINGTON, KY. 
Notwithstanding the prejudice of many and their unwillingness 
to be convinced of the value of home economics in a girl’s education, 
this subject has demonstrated its worthiness to a place in the 
schools, and I believe that question is settled for some time to come, 
at least.
-P-A-G-E-284
284 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The problem which now confronts the educator is the bearing 
which instruction in this subject has upon the other subjects of the 
curriculum. Since the need of instruction in home economics is now 
recognized in all progressive communities, the time has past for 
teaching the subject in its various aspects as unrelated to the other 
subjects in tlie schools and considered by the grade teacher, in many 
cases, as a superfluous and troublesome branch that occupies time 
which the pupils need for their bookwork. 
This lack of harmony between the home economics and grade work 
is not surprising when we look for the cause, for a similar condition 
obtains as regards the relation between the various grade subjects, 
and originated, there is no doubt, in the old faculty psychology which 
divided the child’s brain into as many sections as there were sub- 
jects to be taught, and assured the teachers that if these various sec- 
tions received sufficient training that the connections would be made 
as the need arose for them. In other words, that the mental discipline 
of solving unheard of problems (that is, unheard of in the everyday 
life of the child) would function in the child’s after-school life, as 
needed. 
Although the psychologists have discovered their mistake in their 
advocacy of formal discipline, this belief still dominates the methods 
of instruction today in many schools to such an extent that there is 
an absence of continuity and of practical value in teaching which a 
rational correlation would insure. 
In schools where such methods prevail each teacher is a law unto 
herself, teaching arithmetic, geography, history, or what not, as ends 
in themselves, and not as instruments for the interpretation of life 
problems. Education is for social efficiency, and satisfactory returns 
for the schooling which a child receives will be in direct proportion 
to the teacher’s appreciation of this fact. When the ideal curriculum 
is realized the subjects taught will be so interwoven with each other 
and with the life experiences of the child that one can no longer tell 
where one subject ends and another begins, and the school ‘will be 
a place in which to express the present life of the child, instead of 
a place of preparation for some possible future sphere of living. 
In the economy of nature there exists an intimate and inseparable 
interdependence between the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, 
—known by the scientist as the cycle of nitrogen—in which the plant 
stands between the mineral and animal kingdoms as a manufactory 
of food for the animal. The products of animal life, in turn, yield 
compounds which become food for the plants, and so on and on the 
cycle works itself out. With all eternity in which to labor no atom

of matter is lost in this transformation of one kind of material into 
another. 
In the great manufactories of the country, where commercial gain 
is the object sought, the managers know that they must have codpera- 
tion of the various departments in order to meet the active competi- 
tion in the business world, and nothing is permitted to be wasted. 
For instance, in some of the large packing companies, according to 
a recent report, despite the high cost of meat, the profit to the 
operators comes entirely from the conservation and manufacture into 
utilities, as the economist would call them, of materials which might 
commonly be classed as refuse—the meat itself selling for less than 
is paid for the animal on foot. 
In most schools, on the other hand, the factories in which human 
efficiency is the output to be desired, the most wasteful methods are 
employed—wasteful of time, of the child’s natural ability, of the 
teacher’s nerve force. The reiteration of outworn tradition rather 
than an unbiassed consideration of the problems of the present is the 
trouble with the teachers where such methods obtain. 
Now, what is the remedy, you ask? I shall not profess to be able 
to give an answer which shall be workable in every case as to the 
methods to be employed, but there is no doubt in my mind that the 
solution lies along the road of correlation. 
“In every activity of man the percentage of results obtained, rel- 
ative to the energy expended, determines the evolution and effi- 
ciency of human effort.” Now, we are being told, in no uncertain 
tones, that the public school is a failure; that the results obtained 
are not commensurate with the great amount of money and energy 
expended. Why is this so? May it not be because of this lack 
of codrdination of effort, and mutual understanding among the 
members of the teaching force, which are essential elements in the 
success of any organization? 
Now, it is much more easy to recognize the need of such a sym- 
pathetic relation in the teaching force than to formulate ways and 
means of bringing this about. Several difficulties present them- 
selves; the one which is probably the most inveterate, because in- 
born, is our dislike of anything unfamiliar, and the tendency of 
everyone of us to give a destructive rather than a constructive crit- 
icism of that which we do not fully comprehend. 
The home economics teacher the more rapidly adapts herself to 
the suggestion of correlation because all the subjects taught by 
the grade teacher are old friends, and set forth many of the prin- 
ciples upon which her work is based. The grade teacher, on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-286

other hand, being grounded in the tradition that anything involv- 
ing handiwork cannot be cultural, looks askance at this interloper 
called home economics, which has dared to invade the sacred pre- 
cincts of the schoolroom, with its pots and pans and fumes of cook- 
ing, suggestive as it is of all that is commonplace and material to 
her, who has not learned the wonders which are opened up through 
this channel, all the miracles known to the chemist, physicist, phy- 
siologist, bacteriologist, etc.; the great natural laws evolved by the 
students as their own through this study, by many individual, 
concrete problems; and in which the children are given first-hand 
experience in that which is immediately usable in their lives. 
All arts and sciences touch at some point the problems of food 
and shelter, the most fundamental needs of man, and at all times 
claiming his interest, and from necessity, a large part of his time. 
If this were appreciated by the grade teacher, these problems could 
be used to illuminate and vitalize her bookwork. Were this done, 
we should not hear the hopeless confession as made by a little girl 
recently in a sewing class when failing in an effort to calculate 
the amount of material for a garment: “I know it in the arithmetic 
class, but I don’t know it in the sewing class.” 
Nor should we have girls in the domestic science classes who have 
known “by heart” for several years the table which gives the rela- 
tion between gills, pints and quarts, and who do not know a pint 
or a quart measure when they see it. 
Bookwork alone presents symbols of thought and theories which 
may or may not be workable by any given individual, and necessi- 
tates the employment by the teacher of artificial stimuli and dull 
repetition in order that these theories be learned so that they may 
be repeated. Bear in mind that I say, “may be repeated,” not that 
they may be understood, for no one can tell whether the child un- 
derstands what he says unless he makes an application of it. 
The psychologist tells us that expression should follow impres- 
sion; and if there be purposeful effort, as in the home economics 
work, there is always the involuntary attention which comes from 
a real interest in the subject, and thoroughness, accuracy and skill 
are the natural consequences. 
Aside from the two: or three specific cases cited, in which the 
pupils failed to apply in the home economics classes principles 
which were supposed to have been learned in their grade work, 
which in themselves would not be sufficient evidence of any great 
benefit to be derived by this correlation for which we plead, what 
other grounds have we for this claim?

Well, let us see. We hear a great deal about woman’s place be 
ing in the home. Granted; and also that that is the goal for which 
every normal girl aspires—to be the keeper of a happy home. That 
being the case, has her education in the bookwork of the average 
public school fulfilled its mission of equipping her for this, her 
life work? As a result of this education— 
Does she know more of the principles governing the location, 
drainage, construction, heating, lighting, ventilation and general 
sanitation of her home and their relation to the health of her 
family? 
Does she understand furnishing her home for beauty, restful- 
ness, and simplicity, as well as use? 
Does she know the importance of system as an element of order- 
liness in her housekeeping? 
Does she know the tests for the various textiles with which her 
family must be clothed; whether the “all wool” and “pure linen” of 
the merchant are all wool and pure linen in the light of modern 
science? 
Does she know what it is that gives to the rustling silks that 
property, and the effect that this weighting, as it is known com- 
mercially, has upon their wearing qualities? 
Does she choose the clothing for her family, if ready-made cloth- 
ing must be purchased, with a full knowledge of the diseases that 
may be lurking in those made under insanitary conditions? 
Does she know the relative nutritive values in relation to their 
cost of the foods which the markets of the world are offering for 
her selection; or, if a country woman, does she know, in selling the 
eggs and butter from the farm, in order to purchase groceries 
which cannot be produced on the farm—does she know when she is 
getting the nutritive equivalent of the goods sold? 
Does she know the economy of purchasing in large over smali 
quantities; for example, that olive oil in 25-cent bottle lots costs 
$8.00 per gallon, while in quart lots, at 75 cents per quart, costs 
$3.00 per gallon? 
Does she know how to take care of foods which have been pur- 
chased to prevent deterioration in value before they are consumed ? 
Does she know how to preserve foods when plentiful for the day 
when these foods cannot be obtained? 
In this day of high prices for meat, does she who cannot afford 
meat, know what substitutes to employ to give her family the proper 
balance of protein; how many, indeed, know what the proper bal- 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  288 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ance of protein is, or that it bears a vital relation to the physical 
welfare of their families? 
Does she know how to prepare the foods for the table so as to 
get the highest degree of satisfaction in return for the money and 
energy expended ? ‘ 
Does she appreciate the wisdom of preparing a household budget 
and of conscientiously directing her accounts with reference to the 
amount set apart for each item of expenditure? 
Does she know how to take care of the dependents of her house- 
hold, the children, the sick and the aged? 
All this and more must the successful homekeeper know. Has 
the bookwork of the public school of the past fitted her to meet 
such requirements? Is the book work of today equipping the 
woman of the future for the manifold duties as indicated? Nay, 
verily, I fear not. Too long she has been left in ignorance of these 
things, most vital to the welfare of the home and the nation because 
of the belief, so long indulged, that women know instinctively how 
to do woman’s work. 
Some one has reminded us that for every important vocation in 
life except that of homemaking one must have special aptitude, 
which must be supplemented by long training before one is con- 
sidered competent to do the work; but the business of homemaker, 
which requires the highest kind of intelligence, skill and executive 
ability, and upon which depends the health and happiness and 
prosperity of everyone connected with the home, many young, in- 
experienced women enter, with neither aptitude nor training for 
that special work, nor realization of the responsibility which is 
theirs. 
It is because the schools are not giving sufficient attention to the 
training of the girls for their life work that we witness so many 
failures in the profession of homemaking. With an average of 
twenty-five hours a week in school, only one hour and a half a week 
is spent by the girls in preparation for the work of the home, only 
six per cent of her time given to training for that which the world 
recognizes as her special work. Is it any wonder that girls feel 
themselves unfitted for that high and responsible calling, and go 
instead into the factories and offices and shops, and all the other 
three hundred and more vocations open to women? 
As a result of this failure on the part of our great country to 
recognize the importance of, and make adequate provision for the 
training of its womanhood, we find in one beautiful little city
-P-A-G-E-289

which I could name, in which there are schools much above the 
average in their teaching force and methods employed, the vital 
statistics of 1911 recording the fact that of ninety-six children under 
five years of age that died during that year, eighty-three of them 
died from the easily preventable disease of malnutrition—eighty- 
six per cent of all the deaths of the children of that age caused by 
the ignorance of their mothers of this question of proper nourish- 
ment. If this were exception, we need not trouble ourselves greatly 
about it, but I fear it is typical, and what we may expect until our 
girls are taught more of the laws which underlie physical health. 
To all those against whom I have preferred charges of failure to 
equip the girl for homemaking, there are a few notable exceptions 
to which I wish to call your attention today. In preparing this 
paper, I made no attempt to write to all the good schools of the 
country, but to only a few of the best known exponents of the 
modern movement in education. Some very comprehensive schemes 
of correlation have been worked out by a few of the schools of the 
country, and because those which are before you are among the 
best, and at the same time in shape to be easily inspected, I invite 
you to look them over at the close of this program. I refer 
specially to the schemes offered by Miss Mary 8. Snow, Supervisor 
Household Arts, Public Schools, Chicago; by Dr. Bonsar, Profes- 
sor of Industrial Arts of Teachers’ College, Columbia University ; 
and by Miss Anna M. Cooley, Professor of Household Arts, Teach- 
ers’ College, Columbia University. 
Miss Snow’s scheme covers the correlation of domestic art and 
domestic science with the grade subjects; Miss Cooley’s scheme is 
confined to the correlation of the textile work with the grade work; 
and Dr. Bonsar’s scheme covers the whole field of manual and 
household arts under the name of industrial arts, in their relation 
to all the other subjects of the curriculum. 
You will see upon inspecting the schemes that it is not after all 
a correlation of the work of the grades with household arts as such, 
for which we plead, but for a correlation of the work of the grades 
with the life experiences of the child, and if this is done it will nec- 
essarily strike at the root of this matter of preparation of the girl 
for the home; so, with the slogan “Back to the Home,” let us go 
forward with our education of the future womanhood of our 
country.

Appiinp ArT AS AN AGENCY IN ConservING ENERGY AND PROMOTING 
Erriciency in Correbatep BraNcuEs, aND Some THOUGHTS 
on a SyntHETrIc Stupy or Dusen. 
HARDINIA BERNLEY HOWIE, MONTEVALLO, ALA, 
When President Eliot of Harvard said: “I have recently exam- 
ined all the courses offered by the university and I find but one 
(theology) in which a knowledge of drawing would not be of im- 
mediate value,” my only wonder was why he banished theology 
from the friendly circle. So, asking myself what branches of study 
are not promoted as to efficiency and conserved as to energy by cor- 
relation with applied art, in justice to each, I can make no omis- 
sions. For it has become almost platitudinous to say that man 
is not alone a child of reason; that nature endows him also with 
artistic tendencies and aspirations; that emotions and visions have 
as much their rightful place on earth as have the demonstration 
of scientific truth. 
Art has well been called a language—hence it must mean some- 
thing; it must have within itself some nucleus of truth, some ele- 
ment of rationalism; it must be consistent to remain a joy forever. 
This element of rationalism we name design, and further exalt it 
by claiming there can be no art without design. With this recogni- 
tion and apprecation of the interrelation of objectivity and sub- 
jectivity in art we place the study of design upon a scientific basis, 
yoke science with art. Yet, whereas the ideal of science is to elimi- 
nate the subjective, art exalts the personal equation as a momen- 
tous factor of its being. In this deep sense then, art and design 
are one—perfection of design ever revealing itself as beauty. 
Where can be found an implement more perfectly adapted to its 
use than the common field plow, or where one more beautiful— 
each line charms. We know to beware of the bridge whose arch 
has no grace, whose proportions are awkward. 
Every design must essentially be an expression of underlying 
principles, of principles which have the same capabilities of for- 
mulation as have those of English composition. 
Nothing could be more beautifully simple and straightforward 
than the five principles of design laid down by my honored master, 
Arthur W. Dow—principles whose truth or untruth can be proved 
in a manner convincing to anyone by comparing designs so pro- 
duced with those made empirically or experimentally. The greatest 
stimulus to invention is to work within limitations; and it is amaz- 
ing what widely divergent results are evolved from the same logical

possibilities. Just as amazing also is the progress made by pupils 
who thus learn how harmonies can be produced through these sim- 
ple assumptions. 
In the Girls’ Technical Institute of Alabama, a high school, all 
except music pupils, entering the freshman or sophomore year are 
required to study art four forty-fiveminute periods per week, if 
freshman; six, if sophomore; and save in a few instances we have 
the joy of beginning with students who have had no previous in- 
struction and are eager to learn. 
Our initial problem is brush work from plant life; done first in 
flat ink washes, then as line drawings and finally with an addition 
of color. But before any actual work begins, the principle of subor- 
dination is explained, different ways of spacing are experimented 
with, and it is here emphasized that a vital requisite of design is 
unity, and that fineness of relationship makes fine art. The pupil 
readily sees that she is not trying for a photographic reproduction 
but for an emotional expression. From the first she feels herself 
measurably a creator. 
Because the pupil has another incentive to good work and a 
keener interest in her problem when she anticipates applying it to a 
real purpose, every problem in design is presented as applied to 
some definite purpose. Our second problem is given as a design for 
a square tile. Careful brush work studies of leaf forms, as an aid 
to design, are made before this transformation of things into ab- 
stractions is begun. All tile designs in the little exhibit of which 
we invite your inspection, were thus made with a leaf motif as 
basis; and before this problem is happily ended, the principles of 
repetition, symmetry, opposition and transition have all been 
fondly dwelt upon. Successsful designs are later modeled in clay; 
the finished tile is a visible expression of concentration and per- 
sistence, of originality, initiative and invention—a vigorous educa- 
tional experience truly—but since pottery is itself a fine art, this 
may be called a correlation of art with industry only in the sense 
that art and industry are one. Nor yet do we blush because it cor- 
relates with no specialized branch of study. For if the supreme 
test of education be as to the measure of increased social efficiency, 
in the proportion that a problem quickens the understanding, 
helps to logical planning and develops judgment, is it correlated 
with all helpful branches of study, with life itself. 
The third problem, which has three subdivisions, is design in 
terms of landscape:
-P-A-G-E-292
  292 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
(a) “Trees in Winter.” 
(b) “A Wooded Landscape.” 
(c) “A Landscape With House.” 
This last following, of course, lessons in perspective. As sub- 
ject-matter for “Trees in Winter,’ a chart of bare trees is given, 
and further help from the many trees to be seen from the class- 
room windows. By the aid of these is evolved a simple landscape 
composition with a leafless tree or group of trees as the leading 
thought, the center of interest, to which everything else must re- 
late, must be accessory and subordinate. The analogy with theme 
writing is here emphasized. 
Before proceeding to subdivision “b” a fourth problem is given: 
an abstract design for a border, as motifs the first brush work— 
vegetables, fruits or flowers—are used. 
It is with a definite purpose we thus make a seeming jumble of 
our course of study rather than to follow the customary grouping 
of problems into so many consecutive lessons of each class. For to 
make an abstract design is a strenuous, if enjoyable, mental effort; 
hence, lighter problems are placed between. All problems, however, 
of such a character that with the mastery of each, self-reliance and 
good judgment have been fostered, imagination has been stimu- 
lated, ambition awakened; there is much greater accuracy of ob- 
servation and growth of critical discernment; and that capacity of 
receiving just impressions, which Emerson calls the measure of 
genius, has been increased. 
In our school, named above, we do not correlate the art work 
with household economics. We call it an integral part of that 
course. From the initial she embroiders on a guest towel to the 
costume she makes or the home she plans to live in—all are the 
pupil’s own designs—her studies of lettering, of costume design, of 
perspective, of architecture, are partly to that end. 
Our freshmen and sophomores have finished sufrace measure- 
ments in mathematics before we present any bookmaking; but 
many of them must really see how very skew-geed a book cover 
careless measurements make before they can appreciate why an 
inch is divided into sixteenths; and the difficulty a junior finds in 
proportioning groups of seventeen to fifty-three 2-inch by 34-inch 
photos to a multiple of 5 inches by 74 inches, clearly shows she 
passed “rule of three” with little thought of ever meeting it in con- 
erete form. 
Before the close of last session, I asked the new sophomores what 
their study of art meant to them. Every one wanted to speak at
-P-A-G-E-293

once. A concensus of their several replies was that their whole 
world would always be different because of it. 
What can do more to vitalize or to correct the one-sided tenden- 
cies of purely intellectual or “cultural” studies than a course in 
design which puts emphasis not upon technical skill, but upon 
basic art principles? Is it not idle to question if in the whole 
realm of human endeavor there be—alike from ethical or industrial 
standpoint—any other subject of study which affords scope for 
such continual exercise of the powers of self-expression—or such 
another agency for conserving energy and promoting efficiency in 
everything—as does applied art. 
Public intelligence already seriously questions any cause for 
complaisance over our long-established school curricula. In va- 
rious quarters battle with the “fetish of educational tradition” has 
already begun. Indeed, some school presidents are now being 
evolved who, regarding that education as highest which most in- 
creases social efficiency, which best prepares for fullest living, al- 
ready dimly see the legitimate place of applied art as an educa- 
tional factor. 
Unless I misunderstand their aspirations, there is no question 
that all who teach synthetic design are working for the constant ele- | 
vation of their pupils to a higher plane; correlating their work 
with everything in life which makes for that which is most worth 
while—correlating, it may be, with the Eternal God in speeding the 
day when from chaos, from the discordant wrangling of various 
prejudices, this evolving world becomes the abiding place of har- 
mony and beauty.

JULIAN A. BURRUSS, HARRISONBURG, VA. 
The normal school is a vocational institution, just as the agricul- 
tural and mechanical colleges, the schools of technology, the schools 
of law and medicine, and of commerce, are vocational institutions. 
Its field is special, its work is technical and professional. So far 
as women are concerned, the normal school must, in most states, 
fill the whole place of a technical institution. There is in most of 
our Southern States no other institution above secondary grade, if 
there be any even of secondary grade, to which young women may 
look for a training which will fit them for direct entrance into the 
vocational duties of life. 
Technical, professional, commercial, industrial, vocational, have 
become familiar terms as applied to courses for boys. Most of our 
states make ample provision for training physicians and lawyers, 
agriculturists and horticulturists, civil, mechanical and electrical 
engineers, and some train mining, chemical and other engineers, 
architects and other specialists. What to correspond to these 
courses has been done for girls? These courses for boys are estab-

                                                            lished that they may fit themselves for those functions in life 
which their manhood and the society of which they form a part, 
demand. What have we to prepare our girls for those functions 
of life which their womanhood and the society of which they form 
a part, demand? ‘The normal school is frequently the only school 
established by the state for the education of women; it is always 
the chief institution for such a purpose. 
All will agree that to educate without reference to the future 
life work and interests of those who are being educated, is both 
wasteful and unjust. It is probably safe to say that the life work 
and interests of fully ninety per cent of women may be forecast 
with some degree of certainty. They will be homemakers or re- 
lated in some active way to the work of the household. The fac- 
tors entering into their work are very definitely determined. The 
future homemaker will, as now, have houses to build, furnish and 
keep clean; she will have children to raise, nurse, instruct, guide 
and protect; she will have to give much time to the provision of 
suitable clothing and food for her household; she will have to give 
much thought to the economical expenditure of income, to the main- 
tenance of health conditions, to the entertainment of friends, and 
to. the general administration of the home. In addition to this, 
should circumstances arise and make it nesessary, she must go out- 
side the home and work for the support of herself and those de- 
pendent upon her. In the performance of such duties, in either 
case, she will be responsible not only to the members of her own 
family group, but also to the state, to society at large; hence, the 
duty of the state to give her the professional training needed in 
her work. 
The education of women must then necessarily be of a two-fold 
character—training for the duties of the household and for a gain- 
ful occupation outside of the home. Whatever may be given on the 
purely cultural side, one thing is certain, the state cannot afford to 
neglect the vocational side. Now, the chief vocation for women, 
the occupations which lie most closely along the line of their life 
interests, are teaching and homemaking, and the two cannot be 
separated in our normal school work. 
The normal school must train for.teaching. This is its primary 
function, a fundamental duty which none will dispute. No other 
institution can do this so well as the normal school. This is the 
reason such institutions exist in all of our states. The demands on 
the teacher of today are different and much greater than in the 
past. The functions formerly performed by the home are being
-P-A-G-E-296
296 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
more and more shifted to the school. There is no escape; teachers 
must be prepared to assume these added responsibilities. In addi- 
tion to the regular academic branches, the woman teacher must 
have a knowledge of certain industrial branches, especially those 
which fall within the household arts group. 
To go out into their several communities and serve to the fullest, 
the teacher must be in thorough accord with the life of the people. 
She must appreciate their problems, their opportunities and their 
environment. The reorganization of community life must come 
largely through teaching the children. The success of the corn club 
movement has shown this. If the school is to do its part well, the 
teachers must be properly prepared. 
In my own normal school we are using several country schools 
near the town for our students as practice schools and as centers 
for community work. In some cases the work has fairly trans- 
formed a whole community. Houses are cleaner, more comfortable, 
and more attractive. The cooking has been greatly improved. The 
dress of the people is receiving more attention. Higher ideals of 
living are being established. This has been done by normal school 
girls working under the direction of a supervisor, and at a very 
small outlay for equipment. For the students this experience has 
been of the greatest value. It has put them in a new attitude to- 
ward country life, it has inspired them to go back to their home 
communities and to work there for the uplift of their own people 
and neighbors. The transformations that have taken place in some 
of our students are as gratifying as those which we have noted in 
the schools and homes of the community in which they teach. 
The general aim of the homemaking courses should be to teach 
the art of right living, through the elevation of the ideals of the 
home and through the application of scientific principles to the 
management and work of the household. This will lift the house- 
hold work from the plane of drudgery, which it so often occupies, 
to the higher and nobler plane to which it rightfully belongs. By 
sending out from our normal schools young women well equipped to 
teach such work to the children in the public schools, our influence 
will be multiplied many times, and the results will be more at- 
tractive and more sanitary homes, and better citizens and more effi- 
cient workers. E 
Teachers themselves are frequently hampered by home duties. 
They sometimes do not have time or energy for self-improvement, 
or even for doing their schoo! work properly. This is largely due   
-P-A-G-E-297
  JOURNAL OF PROCHHDINGS. 297 
to lack of knowledge as to relative values and the economic use of 
time, especially in home management. 
For the reasons I have given, it seems to me, every teacher in 
training should have the opportunity to elect some work in house- 
hold arts and should be encouraged to do so. 
Moreover, teachers are needed as specialists and as supervisors 
in this industrial werk. The normal school cannot fail to prepare 
special teachers if it fulfills its duty to public education in its 
state. The teacher of special branches in the elementary school is 
poorly equipped for her work unless she has had the professional 
element largely represented in her training, hence we should insist 
upon normal school training for all special teachers: Since the same 
equipment and teaching force, in large measure, can be utilized for 
the work of the special courses, it would seem to be good business 
policy to have such special courses given at the normal schools 
rather than in separate institutions in the same state. Expenses 
of administration, instruction, support, material equipment, etce., 
are practically doubled when two separate institutions are main- 
tained. 
From the standpoint of training teachers, and if this were its 
only function, the normal school must include homemaking courses. 
But the normal school must fulfill more broadly its place as a voca- 
tional school for women. Teaching is only one vocation for women, 
and many go into other lines of endeavor. A great many girls will 
never teach. A great many of them are not adapted to teaching, 
and should follow some other line of work, in most cases some line 
related to the household. A great many of them teach only a short 
while and then are married and have homes to make and households 
to manage. Some will become professional housekeepers, or enter 
gainful occupations relating more or less directly to the house- 
hold. The life interests of individuals are varied. Possibility of 
choice must be offered, so that the student may discover the path 
along which her interests lie. 
When we speak of vocational education, we mean that type of 
education which trains the individual to be self-supporting. Self- 
support does not necessarily mean wage-earning capacity. It may 
mean work along some other line of one’s dominant interest. The 
institution which trains girls, especially the vocational institution 
for such training, should provide means for enabling them to relate 
themselves to their life work as a vocation along other lines than 
that of teaching.
-P-A-G-E-298

There should, I think, be practical homemakers’ courses—frankly 
such. They should include garment- and dressmaking, millinery 
and designing, a study of textiles, cooking, house sanitation, laun- 
dering, household management, nursing, the care of children, and 
other subjects grouped about food, clothing and shelter. The ar- 
tistic and scientific sides, the ethical and economic sides, should all 
receive some attention. They should help woman to become a wise 
disburser of the funds expended in carrying on the business of 
homemaking. These strictly vocational courses for homemakers 
may be open to girls of sufficient maturity, without high school 
graduation, or without the regular entrance requirements for the 
normal professional courses. Both elementary and advanced courses 
may be given, depending on the preparation at entrance. They may 
be short courses, one year, perhaps. They should be intensive 
courses in a special lines of work. Such courses will meet the 
needs of a large number of girls who will never teach, but marry 
early; and they will also meet the needs of those who teach only a 
short while and they marry. They will reach a great many girls 
who are not interested in taking the regular normal courses and 
who will not devote as much time to their education as the regu- 
lar courses require. If any who take them decide to teach, they 
will be better teachers and better community workers for having 
had such courses, of course, in addition to the necessary profes- 
sional work. Such courses may also afford preparation for those 
who may desire to enter regular trade work in the future, not per- 
haps as a full apprenticeship in the trade, but as a sort of intro- 
duction to it. 
The vocation of homemaking is the most important of all voca- 
tions for women. Upon this depends the development of future 
homes, the rearing and education of the children. There can be 
no greater vocation. 
Even if we consider the matter without reference to vocation at 
all, sufficient claims can be made for including such work in the 
education of girls. The homemaking courses are liberal as well 
as practical, for they open up to the student vast fields of knowl- 
edge and experience. The commercial and social activities of man- 
kind have grown out of the fundamental needs of man, namely, 
food, clothing and shelter. In studying the production, selection 
and preparation of food; the planning, building, furnishing, deco- 
rating and care of the home; the planning, making and care of ar- 
ticles of clothing, there is involved a development of an esthetic 
appreciation for the beautiful in art, in architecture, in textiles, ete. 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 299 
There is high cultural value on every side, on account of the eco- 
nomic, scientific, artistic and ethical conditions entering into the 
work of homemaking. 
In whatever sphere they may move, women play an active part 
in the interests of life. They will become better consumers, better 
producers, better homemakers, by proper education. They are the 
great spenders, the great purchasing agents for households. To buy 
wisely and economically, to select with good taste, articles for food, 
clothing, furnishing; to manage the home scientifically and eco- 
nomically, and for the best good of all the members of the family ; 
to enter into the problems of social life intelligently and to be 
helpful therein, requires a high type of knowledge and skill which 
can come only through training. 
Girls come from the high school frequently with no training in 
household arts because such courses are not included in the col- 
lege entrance requirements. If no course is given in the higher 
institution, they get nothing in this line, and being away from 
home, there is no opportunity for them to come into contact with 
the practical things of life. From the limited responsibilities of 
her school life, the girl is suddenly thrust at graduation into a 
world of responsibilities, and she frequently finds, when too late, 
that her academic course, her music and her art, perhaps, touch 
almost not at all on the vital affairs of the great life upon which she 
enters. Do we not do the girl a great injustice in depriving her 
of an education which shall, while containing the desired elements 
of general culture, contain also that which is of peculiar signifi- 
cance to her? 
Should not the changes that have come to pass in men’s colleges 
in the way of applied mathematics, applied science and technical 
instruction, bring also parallel changes in the education of women? 
Must we not relate woman’s education more nearly to that which 
she will do after graduation? Our courses in science are essen- 
tially courses for boys. The preparation of the girl demands that 
the usual experiments in mechanics and electricity be supplanted, 
or at least supplemented, by the vital problems concerned with the 
physics of the kitchen, of ventilation, of lighting and of plumbing. 
The chemical experiments which are meaningful to the woman are 
those which are concerned with the testing of flours, sugars and 
beverages, with fuels, with water, with certain familiar metals, 
with carbohydrates, with preservatives, with antiseptics, ete. After 
the consideration of a few fundamental principles of physics and 
chemistry to give a working knowledge, the girl should turn her 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
    300 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
attention to household physics and household chemistry, for these 
are what she needs. In mathematics instead of abstract problems 
and applications to surveying and navigation, the girl needs in- 
struction in keeping the accounts of the household. It seems that 
just as much culture value could be found in this method of ap- 
proach. 
It is well, I believe, to emphasize the fact that instruction in 
homemaking includes more than teaching cooking and sewing; that 
it has a subject-matter of great richness and great extent; that it 
is inseparably connected with the sciences and with art, and that 
for these reasons it is worthy of consideration as a cultural subject. 
To broaden and enrich the work, it seems advisable to have from 
time to time talks by government officials, social workers, business 
men and leaders in many lines of endeavor, on betterment in va- 
rious directions, in health conditions, in economic conditions, in 
moral conditions, and especially in the conditions of working 
women and children. Information may well be given as to the 
standard of living among industrial workers, wages and hours of 
labor, the sweat-shop system of production, and concerning the Na- 
tional Consumers’ League, the National Child Labor Committee, 
and other agencies of amelioration. Women’s work in the world 
should receive much attention—the place of woman in industry, in 
social life, and in civic life. Visits may be profitably made, where 
practicable, to homes, factories and institutions of various sorts. 
These should all help to suggest to the students new fields of 
thought and endeavor for their future life. 
To give this instruction may necessitate elimination of some- 
thing that girls have been forced to study heretofore, not because 
this something administered to their needs or prepared them for 
the life they were to lead, but because tradition said that they must 
take the same dose that their brothers took. The rapidly changing 
character of education for boys and the reasons for it have been left 
out of account. If this be true, let us face the issue frankly and 
boldly, and cut out something, if it is shown that this is necessary 
to give place to something of greater relative importance. 
So far as woman is concerned, the State Normal School is the 
most promising of all educational institutions, for in it is seen 
the possibility of an education which shall meet the practical needs 
of her life. The realization of this possibility will come only when 
the state normal school is recognized as a vocational institution; 
(1) in which ample provision is made for preparing for the two 
chief vocations of woman, teaching and homemaking; (2) in which 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
  
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 301 
every student may have the opportunity to elect some work in the 
household arts, no matter what course she may be taking; (3) in 
which the student who wants to specialize for teaching household 
arts may have the facilities offered her; and (4) in which the 
student who does not expect to teach may receive the training 
needed in the work of homemaking, or in one of the trades related 
to the home. 
Such work is so vital an expression of woman’s nature that if it 
is omitted we ignore the very center about which the life of woman 
revolves. Let us not forget that in educating young women, no 
matter for what else we are preparing them, we are training them 
primarily to be homemakers. 
Tun Function or tHn NormMAL SCHOOL IN THE PREPARATION OF 
Women ror THACHING AND HoMmMAKING. 
D. B. JOHNSON, ROCK HILL, S. C. 
The best education of any individual means the best preparation 
of that individual for the duties of life. No education of a woman, 
no matter what its main purpose, should fail to give her some train- 
ing for homemaking. If the place where the human family is 
housed and reared is to be a real home, as it should be, and not 
merely a house, the woman must make it that real home. A man is 
not able to make a real home. His work is mainly on the outside. 
The home is the foundation stone of civilization—upon it must rest 
the welfare of the people. In it originate the forces which deter- 
mine public sentiment upon which the laws and institutions of a 
country must rest. As is the home, so is the community, the state 
and the nation. There can be nothing, therefore, more vital to any 
civilization than the making of the homes of the people. Can, then, 
a well-rounded education of women, the homemakers everywhere, 
neglect to give preparation for homemaking? No college or nor- 
mal school or other institution which undertakes to educate women 
for any calling can logically or honestly do so without making pro- 
vision for giving her training in that most vital and universal of 
her duties in life—homemaking. No matter what a woman’s pro- 
fession may happen to be, somewhere some time, somehow, she 
must have something to do with homemaking. 
Dr. David Starr Jordan, of Leland Stanford, Jr., University, 
well says: 
“The highest product of a social evolution is the growth of the 
civilized home—the home that only a wise, cultivated and high-
-P-A-G-E-302
302 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
minded woman can make. To furnish such women is one of the 
worthiest functions of higher education.” 
Kate Douglas Wiggin, author of “Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,” 
and other well known stories, contends that girls and young women 
should be given the training that will make them proficient in the 
most practical and most fundamental homemaking tasks, that will 
give them actual experience with children, that will teach them how 
to feed children, how to dress them, and how to amuse them. She 
holds that it should lay emphasis upon the discipline and training 
of children and their early education, that it should cover the beau- 
tiful as well as the practical side of life. She insists that the right 
kind of a school for women should turn out its graduates fitted to 
make a home, that it should prepare girls not only to be capable 
nurses of their children, if need be, but to be mothers; that it should 
give to the American homes enthusiastic, beauty-loving, conscien- 
tious and intelligent mothers and wives. 
If teachers are to give girls the training Mrs. Wiggin and hosts 
of others demand, and also the welfare the race seems to require, 
they must receive preparation in the normal schools for doing it. 
We believe so strongly in training women for homemaking at 
Winthrop College that we have there, in addition to a complete 
equipment for teaching domestic arts and sciences, a practice home 
for actual practice in housekeeping by the seniors. We employ also 
an extension worker in home economics, whose duty it is to go over 
the state and carry on work for the betterment of the homes of 
people, especially in mill villages and rural communities, mainly 
through the mill and rural schools and school teachers. We have a 
training school for children where our student-teachers secure 
practice in teaching home economics, as well as all other school sub- 
jects. 
While stressing the importance of training women for home- 
making for practical purposes, I would not have anyone suppose 
for a moment that I underestimate its educational value. Home- 
making, housekeeping, requires soundness of judgment, keenness of 
perception, quickness of decision, promptness of execution, all the 
highest powers at their best, to meet the manifold responsibilities 
and emergencies which arise. What could be more really educa- 
tive than a study which requires the exercise, and therefore the de- 
velopment, of such powers of the mind? 
The wholesome change in the Southern mind relative to woman’s 
work, and by implication, therefore, to her preparation for that 
work, was indicated recently in the response of a distinguished ed-  
-P-A-G-E-303
    JOURNAL OF PROGHEDINGS. 303 
itor of my state to the toast, “The Southern Woman.” He began 
by saying: 
“Tf in response to this sentiment I am unorthodox; if I disre- 
gard the ethereal ideal, and speak not of angels without wings, but 
of women, our patriotic, working, building, achieving women, will 
you pardon me?” and the whole address was in that strain. 
The teacher, as a teacher, must know about homemaking, home 
sanitation, domestic science and arts, hygiene, gardening, elemen- 
tary agriculture, housekeeping, care of children, etc., in order to 
make the school what it should be and what the best interests of 
the community, either rural or urban, require that it should be—a 
strong influence for the betterment of the homes and home life of 
the children and the people served by that school. The old idea 
of a school as a place where the children gathered to be taught the 
three R’s and to be flogged, having no relation to the real life of 
the community, is passing rapidly and has passed in many quar- 
ters. The teacher now who cannot relate her school to community 
activities and interests and make it felt in the homes and lives of 
the people, is no longer considered a good teacher, and is not called 
up higher. 
A teacher who is attracting more attention at home and abroad 
in our section of the country than any other just now, is one who 
is carrying on an experimental rural school, and is teaching in it 
gardening, cooking, sewing, housekeeping, manual training, along 
with reading, writing, arithmetic and other regular school sub- 
jects. That teacher is here to give some account of her experiment, 
at the invitation of the president of the Department of Elementary 
Education. 
In the training of women for teaching, the normal schools, espe- 
cially of the agricultural South, cannot lose sight of the tremendous 
importance and obligation of equipping them for the best possible 
rural school work. Between eighty and ninety per cent of the peo- 
ple of the South live in the rural districts, and the welfare of the 
whole South—urban and rural—is involved in the welfare of the 
agricultural people, who are the wéalth-producers of the country 
and constitute such a large proportion of the whole population. If 
the South is to be educated, and, as a result, is to be prosperous and 
influential in the nation and among the peoples of the earth, the 
people of the rural districts of the South must be educated. They 
are dependent upon the rural schools for education. Hence, the 
sacred duty of the normal schools to prepare teachers specially for 
the rural schools.

It is claimed that agricultural conditions may improve best and 
most surely by improving the rural public schools, by consolida- 
tion and otherwise, but especially by providing for the teaching in 
these schools of those subjects, such as agriculture, bearing upon 
rural life; by closely relating these schools to the life of the people 
served by them, and by educating the children for country life, in- 
stead of away from it. The old, vicious way of educating boys and 
girls in the country to be discontented with country life, would 
prove disastrous not only to the rural sections of our country, but 
to the whole country, if allowed to continue. People do not flock 
to the cities altogether from economic pressure. A false educa- 
tional system has much to do with it. 
The advocates of the teaching of agriculture in the public schools 
of this country, and therefore, of the preparation of teachers in 
the normal schools for this work, have the successful experience of 
long years of trial of such teaching in the countries of Europe to 
support them. 
Many states of the United States now have laws requiring that 
agriculture shall be taught in the public schools, and it is only a 
question of time—and a short time, at that—before all of the states, 
especially in the agricultural South, will require the teaching of 
agriculture in all the public schools. It is valuable not only as a 
practical subject bearing vitally upon the everyday business and 
social life of a people, but also as a disciplinary study and for 
ethical training. 
The introduction of agriculture into the rural schools, with any 
chance whatever of success, waits upon the proper preparation of 
teachers for this work by the normal schools. 
There are now many state and county normal schools in the 
United States preparing their students to teach agriculture. 
The work is yet in the experimental stage, and the courses of the 
normal schools differ greatly in time given and in the kind of work 
required. 
Believing strongly in the duty of normal schools to give instruc- 
tion in this and kindred subjects, Winthrop Normal and Industrial 
College was one of the first of its kind in this country to provide 
for such a work. 
The college employs a Professor of Agriculture in charge of the 
department, who is also inspector of the college farm of 144 acres; 
an Assistant Professor of Agriculture; a teacher for our experimen- 
tal rural school, where we are trying to work out the best course 
of study for the rural school, and where our students may have ob-

servation and practice in rural school teaching; a County Super- 
visor of Rural Schools, and, in codperation with the United States 
Department of Agriculture, a state agent for the formation of girls’ 
canning and poultry clubs throughout the state. 
Our teachers of agriculture teach college students in college 
classes, and also in connection with the work in the training school, 
where the children ‘are instructed by means, chiefly, of school gar- 
dens. A bulletin on school gardens has been issued by the college 
and widely distributed. 
At our Practice Home, maintained to give our students the best 
preparation for homemaking, provision is made for practical gar- 
dening, bee culture and poultry raising. 
In a new Industrial Arts and Science Building, just being com- 
pleted, special provision has been made for teaching agriculture, 
and a model propagation house has been provided. 
In connection with the agricultural work of Winthrop College 
and its domestic science and domestic art work, a meeting of the 
rural school teachers of the county in which it is located, and of 
the wives and daughters of the farmers, and of the farmers them- 
selves, is held at the college periodically. 
A special course of one year, arranged to meet the needs of rural 
school teachers, is given by us, and rural teachers are admitted to it 
upon their county teachers’ certificates. 
This work of giving teachers preparation for teaching elementary 
agriculture is considered so important by the public at large, and 
is of such magnitude that there is a widespread movement to have 
the National Government extend aid to it in the state normal 
schools, just as it has already done in the agricultural colleges to 
the training of specialists. 
The Page bill in the United States Senate, succeeding the Dolli- 
ver-Davis bill, makes provision for the preparation of teachers in 
state normal schools to give instruction in agriculture, mechanical 
arts and home economics. There is a strong national committee of 
normal school men behind this bill, and it is hoped that it may pass. 
Finally, then, my conclusion is that the normal school should 
prepare women for teaching in urban and rural schools, in elemen- 
tary, intermediate and high schools, and should train them for home- 
making, for use in making a home for themselves, and also in train- 
ing children in home economics. To this end, they should: be given 
rich scholarship, sound methods of teaching, practice with children 
in the training school, and instruction in such practical subjects as

FRED MUTCHLER, BOWLING GREEN, KY. 
“And by the way of beginning, let us ask ourselves: What is education? 
Above all things, what is our ideal of a thoroughly liberal education? Of 
that education which, if we could begin life again, we would give ourselves—of 
that education which, if we could mould the fates to our own will, we would 
give our children? Well, I know not what may be your conceptions upon this 
matter, but I will tell you mine, and I hope I shall find that our views are 
not very discrepant. 
Suppose it were perfectly certain that the life and fortune of every one of 
us would, one day or other, depend on his winning or losing a game at chess. 
Don’t you think that we should all consider it to be a primary duty to learn at 
least the names and moves of the pieces; to have a notion of a gambit, and a 
keen eye for all the means of giving and getting out of check? Do you not 
think that we should look with a disapprobation amounting to scorn, upon the 
father who allowed his son, or the State which allowed its members, to grow 
up without knowing a pawn from a knight? 
“Yet it is a very plain and elementary truth, that the life, the fortune, 
and the happiness of every one of us, and, more or less, of those who are con- 
nected with us, do depend upon our knowing something of the rules of a game 
infinitely more difficult and complicated than chess. It is a game which has 
been played for untold ages, every man and woman of us being one of the two 
players in a game of his own or her own. The chess board is the world, the 
pieces are the phenomena of the universe, the rules of the game are what we 
call the laws of nature. The player on the other side is hidden from us. We 
know that his play is always fair, just and patient. But also we know, to 
our cost, that he never overlooks a mistake, or makes the smallest allowance 
for ignorance. To the man who plays well, the highest stakes are paid, with 
that sort of overflowing generosity with which the strong shows delight in 
strength. And one who plays ill is checkmated—without haste, but without 
remorse, 
“My metaphor will remind some of you of the famous picture in which 
Retzsch has depicted Satan playing at chess with a man for his soul. Sub- 
stitute for the mocking fiend in that picture a calm, strong angel, who is play- 
ing for love, as we say, and would rather lose than win—and I should accept 
it as an image of human life. 
“Well, what I mean by education is learning the rules of this mighty game. 
In other words, education is the instruction of the intellect in the laws of 
nature, under which name I include not merely things and their forces, but 
men and their ways; and the fashioning of the affections and of the will into 
ap earnest and loving desire to move in harmony with those laws. For me, 
education means neither more nor less than this. Anything which professes 
to call itself education must be tried by this standard, and if it fails to stand 
the test, I will not call it education, whatever may be the force of authority, 
or of the numbers, upon the other side.” (A Liberal Education and Where 
to Find it. Science and Education Essays, pp. 81ff. Appleton & Co., 1896.)

        JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 807 
Borrowing Huxley’s significant language, “A mighty game” is 
being played in the rural community, in which the school should 
be the central figure. Are the rules of this game understood or 
are the men and women moving the pieces blindly in this game of 
life? Do they know “pawns” from “knights,” and are they reason- 
ably sure of the means of “getting out of check”? Are the boys and 
girls given training such as will put them cheerfully in line for the 
work that they must do, or will they come to the serious problems 
of life with a handicap that they are likely never to be able to 
overcome? 
Wuart Is tHe Rurat ScHoou? If Updegraff and Hood are right 
in their figures, the rural school is the place where 84 per cent of 
the children of the South receive most of the formal training that 
they ever receive in the work of life that they will have to do. 
Note that I did not say for the work of life, but in the work of life. 
There is a vast difference in the meaning of the phrase, and this 
difference must be taken into account in all of our dealings with 
the rural school and its problems. On account of the fact that of 
all school pupils enrolled, 84 per cent in the South are found in 
the rural schools, and the indisputable evidence that yesterday our 
Nation did, today does, and tomorrow will, depend largely upon the 
activities of country life, the rural school and what is done therein, 
when squarely faced, presents a problem that makes all other phases 
of elementary education sink into comparative insignificance. Here 
in the rural school is the place where most of our youthful citizens 
gather from day to day and are taught certain subjects prescribed 
by law. The teacher’s methods, devices and practices may be of 
the very best or worst; it is not my province at this time to discuss. 
Discipline may be adquate or inadequate; it is neither here nor 
there, so far as this discussion is concerned. Neither are the sub- 
jects taught of unusual vitality; but the thing of most importance 
here is the content of all the subjects taught. To me this is the 
most vital thing in the redirection of the rural school course of 
study. With perhaps a single exception (to be pointed out later) I 
do not believe that subjects used for teaching should be any differ- 
ent in the rural school than in the urban school. 
It is in content that these subjects used in teaching should be dis- 
tinctive. Knowledge is only valuable when it is used. It then be- 
come a dynamo that furnishes the forces of life, and rural life is 
made up of certain forces that belong preéminently to it. “Life is 
knowledge in use,” and “education is living”; therefore the content
-P-A-G-E-308
    
  308 
  SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
of all subjects used in the rural school must be largely those vital 
things that rural interests and activities are made up of. 
At this time the rural school is busily engaged in teaching sub- 
jects. It should be engaged in teaching pupils. It is engaged in a 
so-called preparation for life, hoping in a hazy, indefinite sort of a 
way that some good angel will later on find a place for the pupil, 
when it should be making that same pupil live while being taught. 
Who teaches pupils is a teacher—who teaches subjects only serves 
time. The means has been mistaken for the end, and the result has 
been disastrous. Our course of study for the rural school looks 
like an attenuated city school course, when the ends to be reached 
are very distinctively different. The city’s needs are not those of 
the country, therefore the courses of study should not be alike. 
This does not need to be argued, for it is generally admitted and 
understood. The problems to be solved and the interests to be en- 
couraged, developed and ministered unto in the rural school are 
different than in any other phase of elementary education. The 
rural school will not reach the place of efficiency that belongs to it 
until a course of study is worked out for it that is in line with the 
interests, aspirations and the work of the rural community. 
Nueps or THE Rurau Community. The rural community is, if it 
is anything, a place where the practical is the thing that counts. 
There are many “hewers of wood and drawers of water,” and there 
must necessarily always be many who belong to this class. What 
they need is a way to make hewing of wood and drawing of water 
easier, so that with the same effort expended those engaged in this 
work can get more and better results. The rural community needs 
to be made more thrifty; for financial means are greatly needed in 
any full life—not for luxuries, but for necessities. Better homes 
and better economy in these homes; more and better live stock and 
barns for their care and protection; they need better crops and the 
knowledge of how to make better use of them. The rural commu- 
nity needs to learn that country life and city life depend on the con- 
tinued productivity of the land, and the community must learn 
sooner or later how to maintain the soil’s fertility, and how to re- 
store it where already exhausted. The rural community needs to 
learn the actual economic loss to that community of poor roads. 
How much of our country that is today unprofitable that good 
roads would redeem can only be guessed at. Of course the rural 
community needs goods books, papers, magazines, art, literature, 
music, etc., and a better appreciation of the good and. beautiful; but 
how is the country boy or girl to get them when the income of his      
-P-A-G-E-309
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 309 
day’s work is so small? We hand the city boy an education that 
helps him, and give the country child the same kind, when if we 
think rationally, we could not help seeing that we could hardly give 
him an education that will do him less good. Existing conditions 
should not be allowed to remain, but should be made to change for 
the better as rapidly as possible. The rural school is the most prom- 
ising factor in bringing growth to the rural community. 
Should the rural school course of study be different from the 
urban school course? The answer to this question is found in the 
study of the interests of the two communities. Rural life and in- 
terests, and urban life and interests, are vastly different. Therefore 
the courses of study should be different. One would hardly expect 
to make coats and boots over the same pattern; they will either be 
all boots or all coats, and the country boy in this case will keep on 
planning a way to get to the city; and the girls will continue to 
bend their efforts toward getting a certificate to teach for a while. 
We say our rural communities are poor, and that we must do some- 
thing or other to make our country people more prosperous and 
better satisfied. What has our rural school to offer? Here is the 
crux of the whole matter. We have, of course, we all admit, been 
teaching away from rural life, instead of teaching into it. 
Waar Sxoutp tax Rurat ScHoor Coursp Contain? It ‘has be- 
come generally conceded something at least of the following sub- 
jects should form the basis of much of the work of the rural school 
course: 
Nature study, elementary agriculture, principles of hygiene and 
sanitation, domestic economy and some work in manual training. 
When we reflect that the formal training of most rural pupils ends 
with the rural school course, it does seem reasonable that they be 
given as much training as possible in the rural school, fitting them 
in some measure at least, to cope with the material problems that 
each is surely destined to meet every day of his or her existence. 
Teachers of the rural school should be required to master funda- 
mental knowledge in these subjects, and in some way or other bring 
them into the course of daily instruction. 
Naturn Srupy. 
As a starting point for the practical work in the rural school, 
nature study offers a very rich field, probably the best within our 
reach at this time. The science of living things is boundless, and 
life is all too short to comprehend any great part of it. No one can, 
however, go very far in his experience without realizing that as 
 
-P-A-G-E-310

a living being he must cope with many other living forms, some of 
which are his enemies and others his friends; that some are his 
constant helpers, and others equally strong are constantly opposed 
to him; that some are making his life a pleasure, and that others 
are tending to make it drudgery; that living things are “forces in 
nature” either for good or for evil, and that in order to make the 
most of life it is necessary to know what these living things are 
doing in order that a proper attitude toward each may be taken. 
It is the aim of nature study to reveal those living things that in- 
fluence human life most. “Nature study is learning those things 
in nature that are best worth knowing, to the end of doing those 
things that make life most worth the living.” (Hodge.) + 
It is not the idea that we shall teach all things in nature, nor 
that all things are of importance if taught; nor that anything that is 
well taught is as valuable as any other thing. As a matter of fact, 
many things are taught that are not worth the effort or the time 
required to learn them. Only weariness and discouragement come 
from teaching such facts, and only indifference results on the part 
of the learner. But there are some things that every rural schooi 
teacher should see that his pupils learn, because of their impor- 
tance in shaping the conditions of rural life. The following outline 
of a course of study is suggested for the work of the rural schools. 
It is intended to lay the foundation for the work of agriculture, 
and should be used in the early grades.

in a day are cabbage worms, and they feed 10 days; a thousand 
have been destroyed. This, however, does not nearly give the re- 
sults. Suppose these worms had been allowed to mature and be- 
come cabbage butterflies, each would have laid about 500 eggs, 
which would have hatched into half a million cabbage worms. One

can hardly estimate the damaging powers of such an array of cat-

ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE. 
Agriculture is the chief industry of the nation, and its progress 
. depends largely upon our ability to develop more fully and better 
the agricultural possibilities of the country. Inadequate systems 
of farming and ill-adapted agricultural practices are today the 
rule. They should be the exceptions. There is general admission 
that the farmer’s returns from his efforts are far less than they 
would be if proper scientific management and principles were ap- 
plied in his work. The natural conditions of soil, rainfall, tempera- 
ture, and season in the South are almost ideal for a great variety of 
crops, and with practical farm husbandry this section can excel in 
the production of many staple agricultural products. That we are 
not excelling, or in some instances even considered competitors in 
* The bacteria in relation to the health problem are treated in the course 
in sanitary science.

producing those crops in whose growth we should be leading, is 
brought out in every published report, either state or national. As 
an example, take the yield of corn in Kentucky. In 1911 the aver- 
age per acre was 26 bushels. While this compares very favorably 
with other Southern states, it is far short of our possibilities. There 
is not a New England state that did not average during the same 
year at least 41 bushels. On the whole, our soil and climatic con- 
ditions are more favorable than those of New England. The reason 
that we come short of a much higher production must be in our 
system, or rather the lack of any general practical system, of farm 
management. 
The application of a few practical principles of agricultural 
science, carefully demonstrated in each rural community, cannot 
help giving marked improvement as a result. It is certainly not 
going too far to ask that the rural school give careful consideration 
and attention to this important problem. If handled in the right 
way, by a skilled teacher with the necessary training, the mastery 
and application of the elementary practical principles and prac- 
tices of agriculture can be made. Such work would very materially 
increase the aggregate returns from the farm. Take, for example, 
instruction in corn growing.

Any school boy can equal the record of Jeff Stagner, or any other 
boy, if he has an equal opportunity. All that is lacking is the dis- 
semination of knowledge and the practical application of this 
knowledge to agriculture. This the rural school] should do. Sup- 
pose that our rural school teachers should set for themselves the 
problem of increasing the corn crop five bushels per acre, what 
would be the result? Let us see. In 1911 the farmers of Kentucky 
planted and cultivated 3,600,000 acres of corn, which yielded 93,- 
600,000 bushels. An increase of five bushels per acre would have 
made the yield 18,000,000 bushels more. These 18,000,000 bushels 
of corn would have brought, at the average farm price, December 
1, 1910, approximately $10,000,000. This money would have gone 
directly to the rural communities, where it is much needed, and 
would have been of vast importance in solving the problems that 
confront our rural people. It could have been used to build 2,000 
miles of first-class pike roads, or it would have paid the expenses 
of our public schools for two and a half years. It would have gone 
far toward paying the farmers’ taxes, or it would have built and 
furnished many a rural home. Can anyone figure the comfort and 
happiness that five bushels more of corn per acre would buy for the 
rural people of any state? 
What the rural schools can do for improving corn culture, they 
can do for any other farm crop, if they adopt a rational course of 
study and demand teachers who can teach them effectively and effi- 
ciently. Fortunately, practical principles of agriculture are neither 
difficult to learn nor irksome to teach. The subject appeals to rural 
pupils, because it.comes within the scope of their immediate inter- 
ests. Rural life can be wonderfully improved by the united efforts 
of teachers to promote real, genuine, uplifting thrift, through in- 
struction in the principles and practices of agriculture. To teach 
these principles, the teacher must have had a thorough preparation 
in this special field. The course of study that follows is designed to 
give this preparation:

-P-A-G-E-319
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 819 
DIRECTIONS FOR COMPETITIVE CORN GROWING.* 
I.—Ser ection or Lanp. 
1. See that land is well drained and as fertile as can be secured 
on the farm. 
2. If possible to obtain, an acre not cultivated in corn last year 
is most desirable. 
3. If there is a fall-plowed field of clover or other sod, cow peas 
or pasture land on the farm, select an acre from that. 
IL.—Ferri.izine. 
1. Use an abundance of well-rotted stable manure, if obtainable. 
Apply after land is plowed, and work into soil thoroughly (25 tons 
is not too much, if well worked in). Part of the manure may be ap- 
plied before plowing, if thought best. 
2. If commercial fertilizer is used, one analyzing as nearly as 
possible, nitrogen 3 per cent, phosphoric acid 10 per cent, and pot- 
ash 2 per cent, is recommended. From 250 pounds to 500 pounds 
per acre should be drilled into the ground with a wheat drill about 
two weeks before planting. (Do not put fertilizer in the hill.) 
ILI.—PreEpaRATION OF THE SEED BEp. 
1. Breaking: (a) Fall breaking is best; (b) for spring breaking, 
turn soil not less than eight inches, and deeper if not more than 
an inch of clay subsoil is turned up. Better plow twelve to sixteen 
inches deep, if the subsoil permits. 
2. Pulverizing: Before planting, thoroughly fine the soil as deep 
as possible, using disk or cutting harrow, until manure is thoroughly 
mixed with soil. The land should be like a garden or ash pile. 
IV.—Sexp. 
Get your seed corn from the best crop that has grown in your 
section of country. The variety does not matter, so that it is 
known to have high-yielding qualities. (If you have trouble in 
getting satisfactory seed, inform your County Superintendent, and 
it will be attended to.) 
‘V.—PLANTING. 
1. Hither in hills 3 feet 8 inches each way, or drills 18 inches, in 
rows 3 feet 8 inches apart. 
*This is the form used by the agricultural department of the Western State 
Normal School. 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
  320 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
2. Plant 3 inches deep. 
3. If corn needs thinning or replanting, see to it as early as 
possible. (Try for uniformity.) 
4, Plant as soon as suits your conditions after April 15th. 
‘VI.— CULTIVATION. 
1, Any time from planting to four days afterward, harrow the 
ground smooth with a light harrow. (Do not harrow or roll corn 
after it is up, if you can avoid it.) 
2. Cultivate every week or ten days with fine tooth cultivator, 
or one-horse harrow, from time corn is large enough until it tassels. 
3. Keep corn free from weeds. They take the moisture that the 
soil needs. 
4. If bull-tongues are used they should be small ones. 
VERY IMPORTANT. 
Never work in soil when it is too wet, and never cultivate over 
two inches deep. (It will do more harm than good.)

SANITARY SCIENCE AND HEALTH, 
The rural school needs to give much time to the problem of “how 
to live and keep well.” “In civil life,” says Irving Fisher, “there is 
an average of 1,500,000 deaths every year, with 4,200,000 cases of 
sickness all the time, involving the comfort and well-being of 
5,000,000 homes and 25,000,000 people.” At any given time, more 
than one person in every four is suffering either in body or mind, 
or both, from sickness of some sort. It has become pretty generally 
understood that most cases of sickness could have been prevented 
if proper pecautions had been taken. The rural community needs 
information along this line, and it seems hardly possible to con- 
struct any rational course of study without emphasizing especially 
instruction in the prevention of disease. “The care of the public 
health is one of the first duties of every rural school.” 
The following outline gives what I think is a minimum of this 
work: 
COURSE IN SANITARY SCIENCE, 
1. The health conditions in the community. (Study of reports of 
State Board of Health.) 
2. List of preventable diseases most important to the people: (a) 
Tuberculosis; (b) typhoid; (c) diphtheria; (d) pneumonia; (e) 
diarrheal diseases among infants; (f) dysentery among adults; (g) 
scarlet fever; (h) smallpox; (i) malaria; (j) hookworm disease. 
3. Cause of the above and other diseases of their kind. (What is 
a preventable disease?) 
4. Study of germ life, with emphasis on forms that produce dis- 
ease: (a) Biological relations; (b) structure—size, shape, motion, 
method and rate of growth, etc.; (c) conditions favoring growth of 
disease germs (warmth, moisture, food and absence of light); (d) 
erobic and anerobic germs; (e) carriers of germs; (f) how dis- 
ease-producing germs get into the human system. 
5. What constitutes insanitary conditions? 
6. What constitutes sanitary conditions?

7. Typhoid fever as a type study: (a) General—(1) number of 
cases (indicating frequency of disease, (2) number of deaths (indi- 
cating mortality of the disease; (b) cause (typhoid germs taken in 
food or drink—(1) insanitary conditions conducive to typhoid, (2) 
examples of typhoid epidemics and discussion of conditions that 
caused them (“Principles of Sanitary Science”’—Sedgewick) ; (c) 
carriers of typhoid germs—(1) water, how infected? (2) milk, how 
infected? (3) other food, how infected? the house fly (see outline 
under nature study, page 11), (4) typhoid carriers; (d) prevention 
—(1) drinking water, (2) drainage in relation to water supply and 
outbuildings, (3) milk, (4) destruction of flies, (5) screens. 
8. Outlines similar to the above are followed in the study of tu- 
berculosis, diphtheria, scarlet fever, malaria, etc. 
9. Best convenient ways to secure sanitary drinking water. 
10. Milk and its products, from the sanitary standpoint. 
11. The problem of ventilation. 
12. Location and construction of dwelling houses and barns with 
reference to healthfulness. 
13. Practical ways of securing a good water supply for domes- 
tie use. 
14. Sewage and sewage disposal. 
15. The problem of foods and dietetics. 
16. Fundamental principles of domestic and community hygiene. 
A course of study in domestic science and in manual training, I 
shall have to leave to those prepared in the lines. I hope someone 
will soon set for himself the problem of rationally working these 
out and relating them to country life. 
CORRELATION OF STUDIES IN RELATION TO RURAL ACTIVITIES. 
It has not been my purpose to suggest what subjects for use 
should be added to the rural school course of study, or which should 
be taken out. With a matter of revision, I am not concerned at this 
time. Furthermore, I believe that this is a matter of comparative 
insignificance. It is not the subject taught that is important; it is 
the content of that subject; not the thing taught, but the direction 
that is given in the teaching. For a single illustration, most people 
would be willing to readily admit that agriculture, in some form, 
should be taught in practically every rural school in the South; 
and yet, I do not believe that it is absolutely necessary that agri- 
culture be placed upon the curriculum or required. It might even 
militate against its value to do so.
-P-A-G-E-324
  324 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
In the first place, agriculture is not a subject that can be learned 
as a subject, or from a text-book, in any stated time, such as would 
have to be laid down in a school curriculum. Agriculture is a man- 
ner of living, and about eighty-five per cent of the pupils of the 
Southern states belong to the rural schools, and most of these are 
dependent upon agriculture as a source of living. It should, there- 
fore, be lived with and made a part of the warp and woof of their 
everyday lives. I believe it can be better taught by correlation 
with the other subjects in the school As an illustration, take a 
seed-box for testing the germination of corn. The pupils have made 
the box, the soil has been put into it, the corn planted, and has ger- 
minated. This finished product then becomes available for use in 
the school, and a great many subjects may be taught in part by 
the use of this seed-box as subject-matter. In the hands of a skill- 
ful teacher, it would furnish an interesting spelling lesson. Sup- 
pose the pupils were asked today in their spelling work to write 
the names of all the words that pertain to the making of the seed- 
box; in another lesson, those words that pertain to the seeds and 
the corn plant; in another, the words pertaining to the soil that is 
put into the box, etc. These are merely suggestions for the use of 
this work in the spelling class, and I have a firm conviction that 
a lesson of this sort would sink deeper into the lives of the pupils 
than a column of words upon the printed page, most of which they 
do not know the meaning, and only a few of which, comparatively 
speaking, have any significance in their lives. 
Take the geography work, and the seed-box gives an opportunity 
for an extensive excursion, not only locally, but to other countries 
and lands. There is the story of the soil, how it came to be, what its 
composition is; a trip to the forest, taking the tree from there to 
the mill, from there to the box factory, thence into the business 
world, until it is finally landed by some commercial interest, either 
at the home or the school. The nails, for instance, will be traced 
to the factory that made them; from there to the mines from which 
the ore and the coal were taken, and numerous commercial interests 
that center around these things. 
A recent work by J. R. Alexander, Bowling Green, Ky., entitled 
Rural School Arithmetic, gives much splendid correlative material. 
Then, arithmetic might be taught from this seedbox, by using such 
questions as this: If one grain out of every five planted in the space 
germinates, what percentage of the corn will do for seed? If two 
grains out of five germinate, what will be the loss to the farmer, if 
he plants such corn? The item of fractions can be taught here, and
-P-A-G-E-325
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 325 
a skillful teacher will see numerous ways to handle a topic of this 
sort in connection with his other work. Further, no one doubis 
that such work as this will make admirable material for language 
work. As a matter of fact, many people have long believed that 
this work and kindred work along lines of nature should be taught 
in relation to the language work, furnishing material for such work. 
A recent bulletin from the Bureau of Education, by M. A. Leiper, 
teaching language through agriculture and domestic science, pub- 
lished for the benefit of the rural schools, takes the tenable ground 
that a fruitful source of supplying material for work in language 
in the rural schools is the material pertaining to agriculture, na- 
ture study and domestic science. The important thing in a course 
in rural school work is that it reaches out into the community in 
which the school resides. If the school is to lead the rural commu- 
nity, and it should lead it, those things that are of greatest interest 
to the people of the community must be given consideration pri- 
marily in that school. 
The function of a normal school in the preparation of rural school 
teachers, in my opinion, should be the instilling of the principles 
and practices of all phases of rural life, that they may be prepared 
to carry out some such course as the foregoing. 
Tue FUNCTION or THE NoRMAL SCHOOL IN THD PREPARATION OF 
THACHERS For THE Rurau ScHooLs. 
J. J. DOYNE, CONWAY, ARK, 
Since the function of the normal school is primarily to train 
teachers in the knowledge of methods, as regards teaching, discip- 
line and management, it is assumed—a violent assumption in most 
cases—that no special attention need be given to subject-matter 
covered by the curricula. 
That scholarship lies at the basis of good teaching, except in rare 
instances, is admitted, and that the teacher in the rural school 
should possess this in an equal degree, at least, with the teacher in 
the city schools needs no proof. 
Grant then, that the foundation has been well laid, and that the 
student in the normal is in fact deserving to be classified as a nor- 
mal student, and that this training in scholarship continues, it 
seems that the training of those who are to take places in the rural 
schools should, in many respects, be different from that given those 
who are to occupy positions in town or city schools. Possibly the 
main cause of any teacher’s losing caste in a community is his fail- 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  326 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ure to understand, and participate in, community affairs. This is 
especially applicable to the rural teacher from the city. It is im- 
portant, therefore, that he learn of things pertaining to his environ- 
ment, and be able to show himself familiar with those things that 
claim, for the most part, the attention of his clientele. I knew a 
lawyer who was employed in a very important case connected with 
a mine explosion. Before the case was called he spent nearly a 
month in the mining region; went down into the mines, conversed 
with miners, studied the equipment; in fact, prepared himself for 
intelligent questioning of his witnesses. The rural teacher who does 
not know a silo from a milk separator, or a subsoil plow from a 
disc harrow; who cannot tell a Percheron horse from a Texas mus- 
tang, or a Pekin duck from a Toulouse goose; who cannot talk farm 
and farm life intelligently and instructively, will not make much 
headway in leadership among his constitutents in the rural commu- 
nities. ’ 
Two classes of teachers will be found in our rural schools; those 
who have been reared in the country and have obtained their early, 
and possibly their entire, schooling in the country schools; those, 
in the second place, who have been brought up in town or city, and 
whose education has been received in such schools as these urban 
conditions afford. Each of these classes needs special training; 
the former training away from preconceived ideas brought about 
by environment; the latter, a training toward conditions under 
which he is soon to labor. 
Considering briefly conditions as they obtain in the rural dis- 
tricts, there are certain phases that at once suggest themselves. 
The buildings are not adapted to the needs of the pupils. In many 
instances, one-room buildings are found; and in these pupils of ali 
ages, of every, or no, degree of advancement in studies, are grouped. 
The work is to be done by a single, not necessarily unmarried, 
teacher. The text-books are in many cases such as may chance to 
be found in the homes, and parents are loath to purchase new ones. 
The length of school term is limited, and the work must be so ar- 
ranged that the essential features can be stressed, and the course 
covered in a much shorter time than is usually allotted to it in 
longer-term schools. The equipment of the school is often inade- 
quate, and poorly adapted to the needs of the school. The commu- 
nity is too frequently satisfied with conditions, and sees no good 
reason for the trouble and expense necessary to improving them. 
The school directors are unsalaried, hence are unwilling to give 
much of their time to investigation and comparison; read no litera-

ture on education, are easily swayed by personal considerations, 
and at times allow politics to take too prominent a part in influenc- 
ing their acts, and in shaping their policies. The patrons are in- 
different to the progress of the pupils, and rarely inquire into mat- 
ters in which they should be vitally interested, unless perchance 
some real or fancied wrong has been perpetrated against their off- 
spring. The pupils, accustomed for most of the year to active 
exercise out of doors, naturally feel the effect of schoolroom re- 
straints and systematic application. Varying weather, poorly kept 
roads, and exigencies of country life tend to promote irregularity 
of attendance. 
With all these hindrances, the teacher brought up in the country 
is familiar, and it is often the case that he fails to recognize that 
the power is within him to bring about a revolution. The teacher 
reared in the city, on the other hand, is a stranger to such conditions, 
and feels inadequate to the herculean task of bringing order out 
of what seems to him verging on chaos. The one must be brought 
to see the possibilities of improvement of conditions to which he has 
so long been accustomed; the other, to determine how best he may 
use his superior advantages to the good of his school and commu- 
nity. The former must abandon his conservatism; the latter must 
avoid the tendency toward radicalism. Both, however, must be 
thoroughly progressive. 
In the training of these teachers, the normal school must so ad- 
just its course that these opposites may find some middle ground 
where both may feel sure of efficient service. Its plans for courses 
of study, for daily programs, for treatment of subjects, for measures 
of discipline and management, must be such as shall have as their 
aim the evolving of a system that shall meet approximately rural 
conditions; a system that shall be sufficiently flexible to leave to 
the teacher proper exercise of his individuality, yet sufficiently co- 
herent to unify the work of the entire term; a system that shall ap- 
peal to the teacher on account of its feasibility, and, when being 
employed by him, likewise appeal to the pupil on account of its at- 
tractiveness. 
Again, the student-teacher from the rural school has had little 
opportunity to develop the wsthetic side of his nature. His waking 
hours, outside the schoolroom, have been fully occupied with labors 
of varied sorts, and the question of adequate returns for his unceas- 
ing efforts has engrossed his attention, to the exclusion of thoughts 
bearing on those pleasurable aspects that claim the more leisurely 
mind. In the district school, where for a few months in the year
-P-A-G-E-328

he has had the privilege of giving the immaterial some chance te 
make headway, pictureless walls, curtainless windows, flowerless 
sills, and cheerless surroundings have so long marked his career as 
a pupil that the idea that he may wave the wand which shall trans- 
form this uninviting aspect has yet to be implanted. The teacher 
from the city, accustomed to the best that nature and art can pro- 
vide, is appalled by the absence of such things, and feels helpless 
as to the means of supplying them. To both must come the inspi- 
ration from the normal school, which shall awaken a determination 
to make the schoolhouse a haven of comfort and delight to the pu- 
pils, and a source of pride and pleasure to the patrons. Ideas as to 
character of buildings, necessary equipment, sanitation, ventila- 
tion, beautifying and popularizing the school, must be set forth by 
the normal in such a way as to encourage the retarded development 
of the one teacher, and to utilize the carefully developed, though 
uncodrdinated, capabilities of the other. 
The possibilities of the rural school must so impress the to-be 
teacher in them that he shall be inspired to spend much of his 
period of preparation in developing, from the knowledge of what 
conditions are and what they may be, the power of adaptability to 
conditions, in order to set about improving them. The student from 
the rural schools knows these conditions, after a fashion, but he has 
never realized the value of leadership in matters of this kind. Let 
him grasp fully that he may be able to introduce into the commu- 
nity that ease and grace and general culture that mark the cos- 
mopolitan; let him get fully into his comprehension that one can do 
his best only when free from restraints of place and position; let 
him note how “manners make the man,” and gracious ways win, 
where boorishness and ignorance must stand in blazoned impotency ; 
let him discover that the cultured man is at home anywhere, and 
his desire to place at the command of his pupils opportunities for 
self-improvement in mind and body will be second only to his 
ability to bring about these changes. 
The teacher from the city schools, accustomed to the culture, re- 
finement and amenities of his surroundings, must learn how to in- 
troduce among those in different environment such phases of civic 
life as may seem to him best suited to render the pupils genial asso- 
ciates and ready contributors to the pleasure and welfare of those 
with whom they may be thrown. 
The teacher from the rural districts finds his task one that re- 
quires a revision of former ideals, no less than does the teacher from 
the city; the one, however, must be trained into a systematic appre-
-P-A-G-E-329
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 329 
ciation and appropriation of things about which he has before had 
only a limited knowledge; while the other must be taught how to 
modify and adapt the knowledge of things with which he has for a 
long time been familiar. 
The questions of ventilation, sanitation, building, beautifying 
rooms and grounds, before mentioned, and many other problems 
entering as factors into schoolroom activities are, in most cases, 
outside the ken of the rural teacher as such; while these same ques- 
tions have been answered for the city teacher without his having 
been conscious of the fact that they could ever be overlooked. 
Again, the views of the teacher from the rural schools, as regards 
the so-called practical side of education—as if education of the im- 
practical character in the schoolroom is ever conceded—must be 
changed in many essential features; while those of the teacher from 
the city must also undergo revision. This, I repeat, is especially 
within the scope of the work of the normal school. 
The province of the normal school, as regards this phase of edu- 
cation, is to present in such manner the various manual arts as to 
impress the teacher with their importance in the general develop- 
ment of the pupils; their application to the needs of the child; the 
readiness with which they may be made a part of the curriculum, 
and the advantage of having them as a means, while, if need be, they 
may become an end, to the pupil’s development. 
Again, the question of organized play, athletics and kindred di- 
versions may be so reduced to coérdinated relation that the teacher 
may apply—what before has been to him, in large measure, a mere 
whim—definite plans and exercises suited to the needs of the pupils, 
and having for their aim the all-round development of the physical, 
along with the mental, organism. The same differences as regards 
the teachers must again be reconciled; the one must begin de novo 
a study of this phase of school life; the other must learn how best 
to adapt his knowledge to environmental needs. 
With the teacher of the rural school should ever be present the 
thought of educating for contented, prosperous life in the country, 
coupled with the idea of preparation for mingling with those who 
may live under different conditions, and for being able to take on 
the duties and responsibilities of such conditions, should it become 
necessary or expedient to assume them. The disparateness of rural 
and city conditions is rapidly disappearing, and the education of 
today should be such as shall render the pupils, however circum- 
stanced, capable of utilizing the advantages that may come their 
way.

The normal school, then, must fit the teacher for rural school 
life, in the schoolroom and out of it. Much has been said of recent 
years about the school as a social center. Especially is this appli- 
cable to the rural school; yet much of the effort of the teacher in 
this behalf is bare of lasting results, owing to lack of definiteness in 
plan and purpose, or failure to appreciate the importance of live, 
persistent, attractive, altruistic effort on his part. How to plan 
and execute measures that will secure the interest and codperation 
of the patrons are lessons to be learned. Mere readings on the sub- 
ject will not suffice. The originality of the student-teachers must 
be given play in outlining and discussing such plans as seem to 
them best adapted to given conditions. The careful criticism of the 
instructor then becomes of importance, after the work of each 
student has had fair consideration by all students in the class. 
Combining the results of the original effort, the class discussion, 
and the instructor’s criticism, a definite, suitable, working model 
should be the result. Not one, of course, to be followed undeyviat- 
ingly, for no two communities are likely to present the same con- 
ditions. 
If the development of the student’s capabilities, if the idea of 
his responsibilities, if the knowledge of his power to do things, 
have been featured in his instruction, then he is in position to ad- 
just plans to conditions and to carry them into effect as if he had 
fathered them in toto, exercising toward them an original rather 
than a nemonic attitude. 
A gradual development of a feeling of independence, based on 
fixed conviction of the power to accomplish undertakings, is espe- 
cially necessary as an element in the training of the rural teacher. 
He is largely a law unto himself, and his chances for wise advisers 
in questions relating to the general conduct of his school affairs 
are very limited. Every effort, then, in his training should be ex- 
erted to throw him more and more on his own resources, to teach 
him the importance of considering well each step in advance of its 
taking, and of doing things to a finish. Possibly one of the most 
telling definitions ever given of a tramp is that furnished by Mr. 
Bryan, when he said, in effect, that the tramp is a man who 
brought over from boyhood the habit of quitting work when he 
felt like it. Those who have taught in rural schools especially know 
how prone the young teacher is to take up plans and methods, try 
them out for awhile, and then abandon them for, possibly, worse 
ones. Certainly, anyone may be excused, in fact, should be com- 
mended, for dropping a plan that has proven beyond doubt inef- 
 
-P-A-G-E-331
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 331 
fective. But all must admit that a more careful investigation, a 
more rigid analysis, a more definite understanding of the nature 
of the case, a more careful training under those who, through 
study, discipline and experience, can foretell the end from the be- 
ginning, would have warned the novice against attempting that 
which must result in failure. Nor should time be lost in experi- 
mental work. Recently that part of the machinery of a printing 
press used for folding papers in one of our larger newspaper con- 
cerns was out of order. The workman in charge, instead of wast- 
ing time in endeavoring to discover where the trouble was, sat 
down and spent quite awhile in studying the general plan of the 
machinery responsible for the defective work. His conclusion was 
correct, the defect was at once remedied, and no further trouble 
resulted. A lesson specially suited to the rural teacher, who has 
no one “up higher” to whom matters may be referred, may be 
found in this illustration. 
If there is a natural law in teaching, discipline and general peda- 
gogics, then certainly the teacher in the normal school should be 
acquainted with this law, and should be able to make it a part of 
the stock in trade of the student-teacher. 
In the outset, attention was called to the dual nature of the train- 
ing to be furnished the rural school teacher; later the problems to 
be met by all teachers in the rural schools were mentioned, and, 
finally, the necessity of self-reliance, initiative, coherency and final- 
ity in his work was given brief notice. That the normal school 
should be able to prepare these laborers in the fields most produc- 
tive of the highest and best citizenship is declared, and bed-rock 
principles should govern the work of the schools of this character. 
It is well known that normal trained teachers are not found in 
large numbers in the rural schools, nor will they be till the terms in 
these schools are lengthened, the salaries increased, the pleasures 
and amenities of social life much improved, and the voter in the 
rural communities fully senses the truth that his child is the peer 
of the city-bred scion, should have as his just dues equal privileges 
with him, and then demands such change in conditions as will bring 
the consummation of his desire. The rural school teacher should be 
the evangel of progress in this respect; he should be the seer who 
shall foretell the coming of better days; he should be the Joshua 
with his band, at the sound of whose trumpets the walls of indif- 
ference and intolerance shall topple and fall, and under whose 
leadership the people may go in and possess the land.

Tus Function or tHE NormMau ScHoou IN RELATION To THE INDUS- 
TRIAL BRANCHES AND SPECIAL SUBJECTS. 
0. I. WOODLEY, FAIRMONT, W. VA. 
The place of the industrial and special branches in the curriculum 
of the normal school, and the function of the normal school in rela- 
tion to them, is a matter of much importance. In order to get a 
clear conception of their value, it may be well to outline, at the 
beginning, in a general way, the function of the public school and 
of the normal school. Every school exists for some definite purpose, 
and this purpose must be understood by every teacher who expects 
to do effective work, either in the public school or in the normal 
school. 
During the early period of civilization, institutional life was ele 
mentary and simple. As society developed, each of the social insti- 
tutions came into existence in response to some human need or 
hunger; and it consequently took such form and character as 
would, in the largest measure, satisfy this need. The home had its 
origin in the social need of sex hunger; the church, in the spiritual 
hunger; the state, in the need for general protection and welfare. 
As society was then organized, the institutional life met the exist- 
ing needs. As mankind advanced in civilization, the institutional 
life gradually changed in order to keep pace with civilization. The 
existing social conditions, therefore, met all the needs of society 
until comparatively recent times. No schools were needed; for the 
children, by direct contact with the institutional life, gathered 
through direct experience the information which they required and 
the training which was necessary to fit them for adult life in their 
respective communities. 
Later, when inventions began to change industrial life, it was 
found that the social institutions, particularly the home, could no 
longer properly and completely perform its original function. The 
necessity for the father’s going from home in order to engage in his 
daily employment prevented his children from learning the father’s 
work through direct experience, as they had formerly done. They 
lost not only the experience of knowing their father at his work, 
but also of knowing their father’s work. 
Nor was the industrial training of the child the only phase of 
his preparation for life that the home could no longer provide. Be- 
cause of the increased demands of society upon the individual, he 
required a more varied preparation than the home could give him. 
This inability of the home to satisfy all the needs of the child, made
-P-A-G-E-333
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 333 
a supplementary institution necessary, and the school came into 
existence to meet this necessity. As civilization advanced, world 
knowledge advanced rapidly, increasing the number of things 
which a person must know; and the social organization became 
more and more complex in consequence. Vocational life of ali 
kinds was removed farther and farther from the children, until 
finally they had practically little or no opportunity of learning by 
observation or by experience more than a few kinds of vocational 
work. It will be seen, then, that the school had a distinct func- 
tion—namely, to give the child the needed knowledge and experi- 
ence not provided by the institutional life. 
The normal school, like the common school, came into existence 
to supply a need. When civilization became more complex and 
the number of things which the child was required to learn became 
correspondingly greater, it became necessary to find some way for 
him to gain all this additional knowledge in the most advantageous 
way. It was not possible to greatly increase the number of years 
which he might take for this preparation; and hence this greatly 
increased amount of work must be performed within approximately 
the same time as that formerly required to accomplish a smaller 
amount in the earlier civilization. The whole burden of solving 
this problem as to how the additional work was to be done in the 
given length of time fell upon the schools; for through them by 
the teachers the required work must be performed. 
In order to perform this difficult task, the teacher must have a 
special preparation. He must know his subject-matter thoroughly, 
and must know how to present it so as to attain the best results 
possible. This made it necessary for him to understand the child 
mind and the child nature, and to know how to adapt his subject- 
matter to each particular child’s intelligence. The broad equip- 
ment of the teacher necessitated special schools wherein he could 
get the right training and preparation, and as a result the normal 
school came into existence to meet the need for this special train- 
ing. The real function of the normal school, the professional train- 
ing of teachers, is so important that it is a misfortune for any 
normal school to be obliged to include any other purpose in its 
work. Some schools, through a desire to attract numbers and to 
make a big school, lose sight of the true normal school idea, and 
add other departments to their institutions, but this invariably 
means a distinct loss to the normal school feature. 
If the industrial branches, including manual training and do- 
mestic science, music and drawing, and any other special subject,
-P-A-G-E-334
334 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
are recognized as school branches and as necessary in the public 
school, then the function of the normal school with reference to 
them is the same as to any other subject. The main problem, then, 
seems to be the justification of these subjects in the school curricu- 
lum, and the determining just what their functions are as subjects 
of study. There is no common agreement among educators regard- 
ing them, and I am inclined to think that the real function of man- 
ual training, at least, is but poorly understood. 
Many people think of manual training and industrial training 
as being one and the same thing. They regard them as being a 
preparation for a vocation. To me, manual training has an en- 
tirely different meaning. To attempt to justify manual training as 
vocational training is to attempt a difficult thing in mass educa- 
tion. History is justified in the school because of the large num- 
ber of rich concepts it gives, with which to determine the value of 
modern institutional life. Geography is justified because it also is 
rich in the concepts which are necessary in determining the value 
of our own life at the present time in terms of other contemporary 
nations. Science is justified because it yields a very great number 
of concepts which one must know in order to appreciate modern 
life and to properly use and apply what it offers. Manual train- 
ing is justified because of the large number of concepts it will yield, 
if properly taught, of the material and the industrial worlds, 
which one must know in order to determine many material values. 
Just as the value of real teaching of history, geography and science 
depends upon the number of clear and desirable concepts, so the 
real value of manual training and domestic science depends upon 
the number and character of the concepts which the pupils get 
from their consideration. On this basis, these subjects have as 
much right to a place in the public schools as have the other sub- 
jects usually found there. Cabinet work, and any other work which 
represents skilled labor of the highest kind, should not be expected 
from the schools. When it is found as a proof of the results, one 
may safely conclude that the teaching has not effectively reached 
the entire class, but has concentrated upon a few individuals who- 
show exceptional ability, as is the case in most exhibits of school 
work. 
Drawing may be justified as a desirable course in the schools on 
the same basis as those subjects already mentioned. If it is prop- 
erly taught, it is very rich in concepts of a kind not properly aris- 
ing in other subjects; and if no other reason could be given, this 
alone would justify its presence in the schools. Drawing and man-
-P-A-G-E-335
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 335 
ual training, in addition to being very rich in concepts, afford a 
means of expression that in many cases is very desirable. The ex- 
pression of self through matter, of course, does not appeal to all. 
At the same time, all can be helped to appreciate ideas when ex- 
pressed through painting, sculpture, or any material form, which 
is simply another way of saying that a certain kind of concepts, 
which are outlined from the right study of these subjects, is of use 
in interpreting art and nature. Hence, this last is simply a repe- 
tition of the arguments first given. This phase of the study of 
these subjects produces very positive subjective results, and thus 
contributes directly to culture. When a person can interpret in an 
effective way a chair, a building, a painting, or matter in sculpture 
form, he is as truly cultured as though this development had come 
to him through the classical languages and the direct study of the 
fine arts. 
There is no need of argument to this audience to prove that music 
should have a prominent place in the work of every school. If 
there is any subject which has in it the power of producing spiritual 
growth, it is music. Even in its lower forms it is infinitely better 
than no music at all, but in its higher forms we will find that 
which spiritualizes the self; and thus directly contributes to soul 
culture and growth. 
If the value of a subject in the curriculum is determined by the 
number of desirable concepts which it will yield, nature study will 
oecupy a place second to none. Educators have, however, been so 
concerned with the objective phase of teaching and the conven- 
tions of the past and the present, that they have neglected some 
subjects that should have a prominent place in every school curric- 
ulum. I do not hesitate to say that nature study in its largest 
sense should have a very prominent place in the schools, and in all 
the grades of the schools. By nature study, I mean the effort to 
discover or explain the growing, throbbing material world of life 
all about us. I do not mean the dry, dead things and the lifeless 
study which has been given to them; but, on the contrary, living 
things considered through vigorous, earnest teaching. 
I have tried to explain briefly my conviction that manual train- 
ing, domestic science, drawing, music and nature study should have 
a place in the public schools, and that they are as much entitled 
to a place there as any other subject pursued. Moreover, in my 
judgment, some subjects should be relegated to less important 
places to make room for these vital ones. If teachers generally  
-P-A-G-E-336
  336 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
understood the importance of these subjects, then the presentation 
of them would be much more intelligent and clear, and the results 
would be more nearly commensurate with the importance of the 
subjects than is now often the case. 
It is the function of the normal schools to give prospective teach- 
ers an intelligent conception of the values of the different subects, 
and intelligent ways of presenting them to others. If the ideal con- 
ditions existed for realizing this function, a normal school would 
be an institution in which pupils, when they entered, would have a 
good knowledge of the academic subjects, and in addition, would 
have taken good courses in manual training, domestic science, 
music, drawing and nature study in the preparatory schools, and 
who, therefore, came to the normal school with a good mass of 
concepts as a basis for the specific work of the normal school. If 
this condition existed, then the normal schools could actually per- 
form the work which they are expected to do. Since these ideal 
conditions do not exist in many cases, the normal schools cannot 
perform this work as successfully as desired, and hence they are 
subjected to a great deal of unmerited criticism. 
As matters now stand in many schools, the normal schools must 
do the academic work before attempting the professional. Even 
in the case of the common branches, it is usually absolutely neces- 
sary to give considerable instruction before professional work can 
be intelligently comprehended. For this reason, there should be in: 
every normal school provisions for giving initial work in the sub- 
jects under discussion. There should also be an elementary manual 
training plant, with courses arranged to realize the purpose for 
which manual training is justified in the schools, and the teaching 
should be of a kind that will make this result certain. The sub- 
jects should be given as much time as any other subject, in order 
that the large number of concepts which it is desirable to acquire 
may be given, and also that students may learn that these subjects 
are of primary importance and, hence, give to them the prominent 
place which they merit, instead of the secondary place which they 
occupy at the present time. The course in manual training should 
have two distinct phases: First, to make the subject yield as 
large a body of information as possible; and, second, for the pro- 
fessional side, to give the students a real appreciation of how the 
subjects should be taught to others. The instruction given in the 
normal school itself should be a good example of skillful teaching, 
and should be good enough and strong enough to be used as a type 
or example of that kind of teaching.
-P-A-G-E-337
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 337 
The same kind of argument as that used for manual training 
applies to domestic science. The plant should be a relatively inex- 
pensive one, and yet good enough to make the work respectable. 
Respectability in any of these departments is one of the most posi- 
tive results than can be attained, and the character and quality of 
the plant has much to do with the realizing of this result. The 
teaching should not be confined merely to cooking and sewing. 
These subjects should simply be made the center about which to 
group all the problems which arise in home keeping, and to furnish 
occasion for considering these various questions. In general, the 
ordinary work in domestic science is very much narrower than it 
should be. More time should be given to it, and the course should 
be very much richer than it is usually made. With domestic 
science, as with manual training, that excellence of product, after 
the most painstaking effort, under the watchful eye of the teacher, 
is not the first result to be sought in domestic science. Although 
this is important, it certainly is a secondary result. If the pri- 
mary result is realized, this secondary result will come through 
experience, which is the logical way. 
Nature study, if properly taught, would break somewhat into the 
conventions of schools; for it would require more outdoor observa- 
tion and study than is usually given. While one or two excur- 
sions during the term are valuable as novelties, they are not suf- 
ficient to secure the results which are desirable from this particu- 
lar subject. 
Students attending the normal school should possess a fairly 
good body of facts as a basis for the study. A practical course 
should be given in biology of the things that can be perceived by 
the senses; but this should not be too scientific. This course should 
be followed by a course in methods, in which there should be dis- 
cussed the value of the subject, and the fields that should be studied, 
and also the character and nature of the subjects which each of 
these fields should yield. The importance of the subject should 
also be emphasized, and such subjective reactions secured in the 
prospective teacher that he himself will be able to vitalize the sub- 
ject in his own school, and thus secure desirable results: Inas- 
much as the work of the average normal school graduate is to be 
in the elementary schools, it is important that the courses given 
should not be too technical or scientific. If they are too technical, 
the teacher is apt to make his own work too technical, and thus 
defeat the very purposes for which the subject is introduced. I 
am inclined to think that this is a very common fault, and’ for two 
22
-P-A-G-E-338
  338 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
reasons: First, because those who have had this kind of training, 
make their work too difficult and too technical; and, second, be- 
cause those who have not had full courses, feel that they are un- 
able to teach the subject properly, little realizing just how well 
equipped they are to interpret very much of the life to these sub- 
jects. Nature study has not yet come into its own. 
Music and drawing, as taught in many schools, are not largely 
subjective on the culture side. The results are objective, for the rea- 
son that the things that are taught are memorized and exist in 
the child’s mind as bodies of information to be reproduced in an- 
swer to questions. The fact that most teachers make information 
the sole test of their teaching, explains the reason why this ideal 
is so prominent in drawing and music. The best art and the best 
music had their origin in feeling, and the best result which they 
produce must be feeling. The result must be subjective; that is, 
it must take hold of the self vitally, and in such a way as to pro- 
duce an interest and a desire for more. When a teacher can close 
a lesson or a subject with the child interested, and with a desire 
for knowing more of the subject, he has realized the real purpose 
of the teacher, providing, always, that the things in which this has 
been developed are the right things. 
The normal schools should give more attention to music than is 
usually given to this subject. Naturally, of course, there should 
be some discussion of the theory of music, and some instruction in 
the mechanics of music. In addition to this, there should be a very 
great amount of work done in mastering a large number of songs 
and musical selections, which the world preserves because of their 
worth; and every teacher who goes into a schoolroom should have 
the ability, at least, to give his boys and girls thirty or forty of the 
best songs that have been produced. The great songs are a world 
language, and when a person knows them, he can find fellowship 
wherever civilized man is found. 
All of the subjects herein considered have in them a value not 
indicated by their titles. The ultimate aim of school work is char- 
acter. Arithmetic, geography, manual training, music, nature 
study, and all the other branches of study, in some way produce 
character, but not one of these is character. Therefore, there must 
be distilled out of them, in some way, the things that make for 
character. This thing which comes out of the consideration of a 
subject other than the subject itself is the plus element in educa- 
tion, and it is this plus element that produces character. It will 
readily be seen, therefore, that the greatest school is the one in 
 
-P-A-G-E-339
  JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 339 
which there is produced the largest amount of this plus element. 
It is the amount of the plus element produced that makes the dif- 
ference between effective teaching and poor teaching. It makes the 
difference between objective teaching and subjective teaching. It 
makes the difference between a dull school, in which facts are 
merely memorized, and the live school, in which they are presented 
in such a way as to appeal to thought. I know of no subjects in the 
entire curriculum that yield, if properly taught, the plus element in 
larger quantity than the subjects under discussion, and they have 
been compelled to beg their way into the curriculum of our schools, 
and even then have had to be content with a subordinate place. As 
I have said before, they have not yet come into their own. They 
are rich in possibilities for character building, because they give 
exercise to those traits in people, which, when developed, make for 
positive manhood and womanhood. 
It is my conviction that the normal school can be especially help- 
ful in the appreciation of this plus element in the various subjects, 
and can send out persons to teach who can realize it in much larger 
measure than has been realized in the past. To be able to do this 
is the crowning result in all teaching; and for a normal school to 
be able to inspire its students to aim for this result is certainly the 
highest service it can render to its students and to the State, 
through those whom it graduates. 
In order that the normal school may be able to do this, its fac- 
ulty must be made up of persons who have more than mere aca- 
demic attainment; for if this only is present with a teacher, his 
work will be objective, and the plus element will be lacking. He 
must also have touched life in such a way that he represents some 
of the highest ideals in his own living, in his practice, and in his 
teaching. He must also be able to lead his pupils to those places 
where material for ideals can be gathered; and then he must be 
able to consciously or unconsciously assist in weaving this mate- 
rial into the fiber of the life of his pupils. The normal school fac- 
ulty must know something of the philisophy of life; must know 
something of the principles of sociology; must know something of 
the nature of the mind, and its development; must know something 
of the laws of teaching, and be able to apply them. He must know 
these laws in such a way that his teaching will be in harmony with 
the laws of mental development, and in harmony with the laws of 
social development, that all may unite in a unity with the law in 
which the philosophy of life is expressed.

The functions, then, of the normal school, with reference to 
manual training, domestic science, drawing, music and nature 
study, is to give the prospective teachers clear academic perspective 
of the subjects, a knowledge of the value of these subjects in the 
institutional life, and the means by which these subjects can be 
taught effectively to others. Above all, it is the function of the nor- 
mal school to develop within the prospective teachers, through all 
the means employed, a keen appreciation of the functions of schools, 
the relation of the teacher to the schools and to the community. It 
should give them such an abundance of this character-making ele- 
ment that they will be able not only to teach the various subjects 
objectively, but also to make the plus element so prominent in all 
that they do that their teaching will produce great subjective re- 
sults, and thus make the school perform the functions for which 
it exists. 
THE FUNCTION OF THE NORMAL SCHOOL IN THE PREPARATION OF 
TEACHERS AND SUPERVISORS FOR INDUSTRIAL BRANCHES 
AND OTHER SPECIAL SUBJECTS. 
JOHN R. KIRK, KIRKSVILLE, MO. 
The normal school in the Middle West and in some parts of the 
South is a practical and historic development. There is no reason 
why any two normal schools should be just alike. Each one is 
usually a response to concrete local needs and demands in public 
school education. At least this is true where officials and bureaus 
and committees at a distance have kept their hands off and allowed 
public school education to get from the normal school what the 
people asked for and needed. : i 
There are some powerful forces now operating in education. Hence 
it is well to get our bearings before we proceed very far. We are 
reminded that the universities are and always have been “free and 
self-determining.” Doubtless those on independent foundations have 
aright to beso. Probably others created by the will and the authority 
of a state ought to be largely, but never wholly, “free and self-deter- 
mining.” Perhaps the people may demand of the university that it 
do some things which its governing officials and faculty would not 
of their own initiative and free will undertake to do. 
In view of all the facts in the case, it would seem also to be true 
that the normal school authorized, created’ and supported by the 
people should be “free and self-determining” to the same extent as the 
university of the state is “free and self-determining.” But some 
 
-P-A-G-E-341
    
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 841 
normal schools in some states at the present time are not in any sense 
free or self-determining. Some of them are dominated by men in 
other higher education circles. It is doubtless well in this connection 
to remember Mr. Herbert Spencer’s formula of justice, which in its 
application to school education would read as follows: “Each insti- 
tution is and should be free to do what it wills to do, provided there 
be no infringement of the equal freedom of any other institution.” 
I think this principle ought to be very far reaching and very help- 
ful in education. Normal schools, colleges and universities as well 
as public schools in our country are yet in the making. No one can 
safely predict what the development of any institution may culmi- 
nate in, provided the institution is allowed that freedom to respond 
to community wants and needs which the formula of justice would 
provide. 
Since in any event the normal school has been a practical and 
historic development up to the present time, whether free or not free, 
we are to consider what next may be done. 
But we are obliged to hear in tone of deep gravity from some higher 
education circles the phrase: “Normal schools developing into fields 
hitherto occupied by colleges and universities.’ This phrase of 
dubious purport has birth in ignorance, misconception, and a suspicion 
of selfish interest. For in the preparation of teachers as a practical 
proposition in America, the normal schools were first in the field. 
Until within the last two decades the colleges and universities almost 
uniformly ridiculed the science and art of teaching. More than fifty 
years ago the people of several states provided in constitutions or 
statutes that the universities might develop departments for the 
preparation of teachers. But the universities as a rule refused and 
neglected to make any practical use of the authority conferred upon 
them. Hence by statutes or otherwise the normal schools had to 
be created. They got into the field and developed under as great 
freedom as the tyranny of external interference would permit. 
In some localities the normal school as it now exists cannot pre- 
pare special supervisors and special teachers because insufficient time 
is provided for such preparation. By normal school we mean an 
institution whose combined academic and pedgaogic work begins at 
or near where high-school education leaves off and covers courses 
from three to five years in length. 
The normal school is not a college. As an agency for the exclu- 
sive purpose of preparing teachers it may or may not include all that a 
college can do. It is for specific purposes. The college is for general 
purposes. External interference in many states holds down the nor-

mal school course to the brief period of two years of time. Thor- 
oughgoing normal school men, however, who are free to think and 
act for themselves and who have recent personal experience in pub- 
lic school education have for some time been convinced beyond doubt 
that no trustworthy professional teachers of any kind can be well 
prepared in so short a time as two years. They are of the opinion 
that the normal school must have from three to five years in which 
to prepare a really good professional teacher for any grade or kind 
of public school. The short course normal school product can serve 
only temporary purposes and never lift public school education above 
the commonplace. 
The effective improvement of public school education through 
normal schools is to be made by transforming typical high school 
products into capable and practical professional teachers. The fact 
that the advanced grammar grade child and the slightly older high 
school child are going through the periods of adolescent storm and 
stress and the further fact that high school instruction is seldom as 
thorough as it ought to be constitute prima facie evidence of a con- 
dition pretty generally corroborated by experience. It is this: It 
takes about a year to make a typical high school graduate reasonably 
thorough in those grammar grades and high school studies which con- 
stitute a fundamental academic basis in the make-up of a good public 
school teacher, whether in elementary school or in high school. The 
theorizer and dogmatist in higher education circles who doesn’t know 
the fact is likely to be the rankest and boldest in denying it. In any 
event a good many of these alleged authorities in the theory of edu- 
cation do at least ignore the fact. Too many colleges and schools 
of education are contentedly engaged in the fatal folly of putting an 
expensive veneer on high school graduates with a view to labeling 
them ready for the profession of teaching. As a would-be teacher, 
the recent college graduate is usually narrowed by premature special- 
ization and somewhat surfeited and more or less spoiled by the veneer- 
ing in which the specialization takes form. Too many intending 
teachers coming from the higher institutions are not sufficiently in 
sympathy with the public school studies to appreciate such studies 
and use them as the foundation and the background in the conscious- 
ness of the public school child. 
We come now to another practical issue. There are some things 
that the courageous and well conducted normal school feels obliged 
to do whether it is free or not free. It must build safely, honestly, 
and thoroughly some foundations. It is obliged to strengthen every 
prospective teacher in the basic phases of public school studies. Some 
 
-P-A-G-E-343

day the School of Education in every good university will disecver 
its obligation to education and do precisely the same thing. The 
normal school does some of this work through such courses as are 
designated in the following terms: “Sixty Lessons in the Teaching 
of English”; “Sixty lessons in the Teaching of Sanitation and Allied 
Subjects”; “Sixty lessons in the Teaching of Fine Art, Manual Arts, 
and Music.” These courses involve some reviews but much more 
in the breaking of new ground. Then in order to develop mental 
virility and to stimulate mental alertness and induce habits of cogi- 
tation the normal school is obliged to sharpen and extend the con- 
ceptions of its students through the intensive study of some History, 
some English, some Science, and some other subjects above the rank 
of those given in high school. Otherwise knowledge of pedagogical 
principles and processes cannot function effectively. 
The normal school is not a mill to grind out semi-conscious teach- 
ing automatons through drilling and “training” in mechanical rules 
and processes. It is to quicken the wits. It is to intensify knowl- 
edge. It is to give through study some technical knowledge and 
through action some technical skill. It is not to load consciousness 
with a diet of predetermined and sterilized methods. It is to pro- 
duce habits of looking into things and power of personal initiative 
with a disposition to discriminate between formality and substan- 
tiality. It is to stimulate constructive ideality. It is to enlarge the 
horizon. It is to produce clear-minded, anxious, self-assertive, in- 
dividuals inclined to pry into subject-matter, find its relation to the 
mental content of those to be taught, and construct ways and means 
as necessities arise. 
The good normal school in from three to five years enables the 
intending teachers to discover themselves and to learn what things 
they are good for. It encourages differentiation by natural pro- 
cesses and not by premature and conventional classifications. The 
natural differentiation in a good-sized, well-equipped normal school 
leads a large percentage of the intending teachers to select for them- 
selves the kind and grade of schools in which they by nature and de- 
veloped capability are best fitted to teach. The result is some 
excellent teachers and supervisors in Music, some in Manual Arts, 
some in Fine Art, some in one thing and some in another. 
For illustration, I venture to mention a large normal school having 
about three hundred male students and about four hundred young 
women students all averaging about twenty-one years of age, all 
somewhat enthusiastically preparing themselves to be teachers of some 
kind. Few of them have definite conceptions of the kind of teaching
-P-A-G-E-344
344 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
they will do until they have been two or three years in the normal 
school. They are reasonably free to elect their studies from the outset. 
By virtue of their freedom they are more intensely interested in their 
studies than they otherwise could be. Some time before graduation 
many of them come to have a distinct and pronounced pride in their 
prospective specialties. This at least is true of about a third of the 
intending teachers in the normal school of the character mentioned. 
A somewhat larger number of intending teachers will of course 
under various influences prepare themselves to teach fairly well a 
variety of subjects which have to be taught in public schools. It is 
evident, therefore, what the result must be as to the variety of in- 
tending teachers coming out of an ambitious normal school having 
unhampered opportunity to meet the demands that people in the 
enjoyment of freedom will make upon it. 
The up-to-date normal school runs under high pressure. It is 
neither narrow in range nor short of vision. It follows no traditions. 
It treads no beaten paths. It may change its mode of procedure any 
day to meet the needs of a community undergoing rapid transitions. 
Its program, like the railroad ticket, is “for one day only.’”’ Its out- 
put of intending teachers finds ready employment at ample compen- 
sation. Through its well-chosen equipments and its faculty of full- 
fledged men and women, themselves professional teachers, possessed 
of scholarship, skill and virility, such a normal school supplies many 
kinds of capable and enthusiastic professional teachers and super- 
visors for the various school studies and activities, including the in- 
dustrial branches and the other so-called special subjects. 
THE FUNCTION OF THE NORMAL SCHOOL—GENERAL DISCUSSION. 
JAMES K. POWERS, FLORENCE, ALA. 
It would be difficult, if not indeed impossible, for me to add any 
thought of value to the very admirable presentations in the papers to 
which we have just listened. I pass them with the single remark 
that as the shortest and surest route to the minds and hearts of a people 
is through its school children, so the shortest and surest route by 
which to reach the children lies through the teachers trained for its 
schools. 
I trust that I may be pardoned, therefore, if I ask your attention 
briefly to what I consider the most important function of the normal 
school. It seems all the more important that this function be not 
overlooked on such an occasion because it is in large measure indirect 
while those previously discussed are more direct. They may be studied 
in class—in some cases by the use of text-books; but this is scarcely 
true of what I have in mind.
-P-A-G-E-345

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 845 
I refer to the work of normal schools, including departments of 
pedagogy and schools of education in colleges and universities, in 
setting up and maintaining educational standards and valuations. 
This does not go into courses of study. Texts are scarcely available, 
and if they were and were studied, the results would be artificial rather 
than real. 
Normal school teachers properly spend a large part of their time 
in studying the child, rather than in hearing lessons and giving instruc- 
tion. They study text-books, school systems and kindred subjects, 
and measure them by their ideals as related to the development of 
children. Compared with their number, normal school faculties 
write a very large proportion of our text-books, especially those on 
elementary branches and professional subjects. A glance at the 
title pages of such books will verify this statement. 
In most of the states within the jurisdiction of this Association 
normal schools graduate but a small proportion of the teachers. 
But these few set up a standard of scholarship by which other teachers 
are judged on examination for license. 
Their work in the school room and in the communities in which 
they teach is also a standard of comparison by which patrons and 
school boards judge other teachers. 
Again, teachers trained in normal schools are apostles of progress 
in educational lines. They are usually found in the forefront of every 
struggle for advancing educational outposts and elevating their pro- | 
fession. If you have not observed these things, you may verify them 
by a retrospective view of your community and state, or by watching 
the trend of future events. Eliminate the progress promoted by 
normal school influences in most of our Southern states and but 
little will be left. 
Normal schools have had a large share in professionalizing the 
work of teachers. The moral effect of a body of men and women 
trained as teachers is wholesome. It is much the same as that of 
officers for the army and navy trained at West Point and Annapolis. 
These naturally have a prestige that those who come through other 
channels have not. Those trained for a profession set the pace for 
that profession. 
Not a few of the members of this Association have seen the begin- 
ning of Southern (State) normal schools. If I mistake not, Alabama 
and Texas led in the movement. Other states followed, until at this 
writing practically all have fallen into line. In the early days many 
of these schools had to fight for their lives, but they have won the 
fight, they have demonstrated their right to exist as the pace-makers 
of our educational systems.

INTRA-MURAL SPORTS. 
W. R. WEBB, BELL BUCKLE, TENN. 
Play in the young is the result of instincts which dawn before they 
are really needed in the struggle for existence. This is nature’s way 
of teaching. The young rabbit has learned to escape his first attack 
from a fox by playfully escaping from his playmates; and the kitten 
by jumping upon moving objects has learned to catch his first mouse, 
when hunger drives him to it. Like all instincts, play and its com- 
panion imitation are given for purposes of utility. They constitute 
nature’s school. We sometimes say that an animal plays because it 
is young, but it is probably nearer the truth to say that an animal 
has a period of youth in order that it may play. 
Through the play instinct nature touches every phase of the child’s 
activity, physical, mental, moral and social, and the child that spends 
the greater part of his time in healthy, vigorous play until he is eight 
years old is not wasting his efforts in any sense, however much over- 
ambitious parents may wish to put him to work on more serious tasks. 
The first task of any animal is to gain the mastery of his own body. 
Play gives him this control. By kicking, running, jumping, pushing, 
and throwing in pure play he is learning to make his own muscles 
react as he wills them. It gives agility, dexterity, swift and depend- 
able reactions, makes the digestion strong, the chest full, the heart 
vigorous, in the end giving complete control of the body and with it 
all it brings that “T’m-glad-I’m-alive” sort of feeling. 
The mind is clearer when the body is fit, but play does more than 
this for the mental side. It helps the development of the perceptive 
faculties, makes the child see clearer, hear more distinctly and feel 
more acutely. It concentrates the attention, demands rapid and 
correct judgments, rare presence of mind; it exercises the will, sharp- 
ens the intellect generally, and greatly assists in getting control of 
the mental faculties. 
Through group games play leads'a boy to his social adjustments, 
and next to the physical this is probably its greatest benefit. It 
teaches him how to get along with his fellows; how to co-operate with 
others for a common purpose. In all group games the wishes of the 
individual must be subordinate to the good of the group. Out of 
this there comes social sympathy, the willingness to help others, the 
first lessons in service to others, respect for and submission to law.
-P-A-G-E-347
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 347 
While it teaches a boy that he must make the wishes of the group his 
own, it also teaches him how to make his wishes become those of the 
group, and hence it develops leadership in a marked degree. 
Out of the social adjustments in play there comes for the first time 
clear perceptions of moral qualities, respect for the right of others, 
fairness, justice, obedience to law. It demands industry, energy, 
perseverance, courage, unselfishness and gives a motive for those 
traits. It teaches control of the emotions of anger and jealousy. 
On the negatively moral side it represses the purely physical appe- 
tites by giving an outlet in some other direction, and to the ambitious 
player it adds a strong motive to let alone all forms of intemperance, 
which will make him less fit for success in his games. 
Life is a battle demanding courage and it is through play that 
nature develops the fighting instinct, which is not such an undesirable 
quality as we sometimes think. There can be little doubt that battles 
in war often have been won by qualities instilled in the fighters on the 
play grounds in their youth. 
What, then, should be the attitude of the school toward play? 
As play is usually regarded as activity that finds in itself its only reason 
for existence and has no serious purpose, some have tried to suppress 
it. “The Pietist Tollner,” according to Professor Groos, ‘uttered 
this sentiment at a conference: “Play, of whatever sort, should be 
forbidden in all evangelical schools, and its vanity and folly should 
be explained to the children with warnings of how it turns the mind 
away from God and eternal life, and works destruction to their im- 
mortal souls.’”” He evidently did not realize that play was nature’s 
method of teaching and that it was one of the most valuable adjuncts 
to that artificial thing we call the school. 
John Wesley, too, failed to catch the spirit. In his Kingswood 
school he provided a schedule to take every hour of the twenty-four. 
When criticised because he had allowed no time for play he answered, 
“Boys should not play, for if they play while boys, they will play 
when men.” He believed the boy should be directed at all times and 
in all his activities by his instructors, and while he allowed one hour, 
for physical exercise, the manner of it was always prescribed. He 
did not know that through play nature lets off the energy which has 
accumulated in the channels, for which there is no outlet in the serious 
work, nor did he realize that this function of physical exercise will - 
be lost unless it is in large measure undirected. He knew that real 
play was dependent upon a sense of freedom—that “I-don’t-have-to” 
sort of feeling, and not approving of this, under his rigid system of 
discipline he took it away and turned the play of his boys into the
-P-A-G-E-348
  348 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
hardest kind of work. It is needless to say that this plan was not a 
success. 
The problem that we are facing is not how to suppress play, but 
how to use it to the best advantage, how to get the greatest good and 
the least harm from it. In trying to solve this question the school, 
which I represent first tried the match game method. In 1874 it or- 
ganized a baseball team and advertised that it was ready to meet 
all comers. The idea was taken from the German journals of sec- 
ondary education of that day; and tradition says that it was the first 
school in the south, if not in America, to organize a school team. I 
have not been able to verify that report, but it is true that there were 
no other school teams within reach for them to compete with at that 
time. For the contests they depended upon the town teams of Col- 
umbia, Pulaski, Hickory Creek and Possum Trot. 
There grew up great excitement over these contests. Special 
trains were run, brass bands engaged, and there were large headlines 
in the papers. Demoralizations grew up. Some members of the 
visiting teams got drunk. Two were arrested for the theft of the 
legs of a printing press, which they sold as old iron to secure money 
enough to purchase railroad tickets to go to the school for play. The 
visiting teams were ever ready to bet upon themselves and cultivate 
the sentiment that loyalty to the school team demanded that the 
boys back their team with their money. The boys of Hickory Creek 
laid out the umpire and the boys of Possum Trot tried to lay out the 
school. There were undesirable newspaper controversies, explana- 
tions of “where we missed it,” charges and countercharges of unfair- 
ness, of various sorts and kinds. And this was all in the good old 
days when there was no professional coach and no gate receipts. What 
is the use of recounting more? After about two seasons the school 
forbade any further participation in contests of any sort with other 
schools, and it has abided by that decision until the present time. 
In showing the objection to this system I do not wish to be in the 
attitude of criticising any competitors, but I am simply comparing 
the two systems as we have found them by actual practice. 
Living is a fine art and its artistic application consists in getting 
a proper perspective of life’s various phases and putting the proper 
emphasis upon each one of them. The school that neglects any one 
of these phases fails to equip its pupils to cope successfully with their 
environment. And the school that puts an undue emphasis upon 
any one of them fails to produce the well rounded man. Most vices 
come from putting an undue emphasis upon activities that per se 
may be harmless. Play should be a part, but only a part of training. 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 849 
Now, the match game is spectacular, because it is a school activity 
that appeals to the masses outside of the school room; but self-exhibi- 
tion is an instinct entirely too strong in the average youngster, and 
the spectacular side of match games gives a strong incentive to its dis- 
play. This makes him place too much emphasis upon play, he regards 
it as an end within itself, and not as a means to an end; as creation, 
not as recreation. The fact that it brings praise from older people 
and brings immediate prominence, makes the boy neglect those 
serious pursuits whose rewards are far greater and more worth while, 
but which are placed in the far distant future. Therefore this sort 
of thing places a false emphasis upon play and sometimes makes it 
a vice, although it may not be forbidden by the law of Moses. 
Match games make the athlete the hero of the school. He is 
applauded when he enters chapel, toasted by the girls, and his picture 
appears in the papers. The little boy with strong imitative tenden- 
cies takes him as a model, failing to see, perhaps, that he has won 
his position only because he is big and beefy; his bad qualities are 
also regarded as a necessary part of his stock in trade, and these, too, 
are imitated. 
Match games place too much emphasis upon winning. The desire 
to win results in too much training, training that produces over- 
strain and is damaging to the health. The physicians are contin- 
ually warning us about this. The faculties are partly to blame for 
this over-emphasis, as some of them think that winning is a form of 
advertisement. 
Because of the desire to win the game takes more than its due 
proportion of time, resulting in poor lessons, and hence damaging 
to the mental side. A scholarship requirement is sometimes de- 
manded, but too often an instructor hasn’t courage enough to enforce 
it against the public sentiment of the school, and the sporting ele- 
ment of the town, which sometimes tries to interfere. 
But it is on the moral side that the desire to win does its most 
serious damage. Match games not only fail to teach respect for the 
right of others, but ofttimes teach the very opposite. As a college 
student I was for three years captain of the college “scrub” football 
team. I was never a candidate for the college team out of regard to 
the wishes of a wise father, although I must confess that I did not 
see the widsom of that decision at the time. My position allowed 
me to be present at all meetings between the college team and the 
coach. The latter was a football hero, beloved and admired by all 
the boys. His parting advice on the eve of each game was this: “Now, 
fellows, win the game; win it fairly if you can, but win it.” How can
-P-A-G-E-350
  350 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
play instill its moral lessons in the face of such teaching as that? I 
believe a boy should play and should play to win, but to win by skill 
and dexterity, and not by unfairness. When too much emphasis is 
placed upon winning, the player is too apt to say “all’s fair in love 
and war, in play and politics.” 
The desire to win also accounts for the unfair methods that are 
used to get skilled players. Men are paid in various ways. Some- 
times this is done with the knowledge of the faculties, though this is 
rare. Sometimes the student body pays them, more often it is the 
manager, or the alumni. Sometimes the blame rests directly upon 
the sporting element of the town, but in all cases the fault lies at the 
door of the system. In some cases the shrewdest sort of devices are 
resorted to, in order to keep the letter, while violating the spirit of 
the law. ‘‘Whipping the devil around the stump” is the surest way 
to destroy the finer moral perceptions. 
The desire to win forces the boys to employ paid coaches and to 
buy expensive paraphernalia. This demands a lot of money, which 
is usually handled by inexperienced boys and brings its own tempta- 
tions. There was a time when I was greatly interested in the annual 
promises to reform the abuses of the match game. I now believe 
that this can never be done until we have ended once and for all the 
gate receipts and the employment of professional coaches. This 
work should be done by the physical director. He should be a grad- 
uate in medicine if possible, thoroughly acquainted with his tech- 
nical knowledge, but above all a man of a high type of character, 
and in all cases he should be a member of the faculty, selected by the 
president and trustees, and not by the student body. 
I do not urge against match games that they are dangerous from 
the standpoint of accidents. Courage is just as necessary in the 
proper equipment of a real man as any other moral quality,.and it 
can be developed in a growing boy only by actually undergoing risks 
of some sort, and using his brain to meet them effectively. 
But the chief objection to match games I have reserved for the 
last. Whatever ills may come to the actual contestants in these 
games, it is the rooters that suffer the most. The team gets too much 
exercise, the rooters not enough. They have no outlet for their 
physical energy, but sit idly by, watching the other fellows play. 
The close association with the sporting class of the town is very bad, 
leading to betting, loudness in manners and in dress. Self-exhibition 
is not good for the player, but for the rooters it is positively degrading. 
The excessive time that the player devotes to getting ready to win is 
also wasted by the rooter in his endless gab, gab, gab, both before and 
after all important games.

The real problem is how to secure less athletics, but more physical 
training; how to make our games less intensive, but more extensive; 
how to avoid overstrain for the players and no strain for the rooters. 
According to the daily press of October 20th of this year, Professor 
William G. Anderson, Director of Physical Training at Yale, was 
reported as saying, “I would much rather see 22,000 students playing 
football and 200 spectators, than 22,000 spectators and 22 players. 
We at Yale hope to bring about a condition whereby sports will be 
enjoyed by the masses and not by the comparatively few.” 
As I have pointed out above our school banished match games for 
moral reasons. We would not return to them for physical reasons. 
With a school team as a center of interest, we would have at most 
twenty-two to twenty-five boys daily playing football and 225 looking 
on. On the contrary, during the past fall we had thirteen thoroughly 
organized football teams. They report that they have had about 
one hundred and fifty boys regularly exercising in this way. I counted 
134 actually playing football on one afternoon, and Professor Stewart 
Mims tells me that he once counted 145. No school should under- 
take this system unless it has plenty of playground. One of my 
troubles is to find places enough for the various teams to practice. 
In the fall football is the center of interest, but many other sports 
are enjoyed at the same time. There were very few spectators at 
these games, but nearly every boy was engaged in some healthy out- 
of-door sport. 
Practically all of the abuses and undesirable traits of play come 
from placing too much emphasis upon this one phase of school life. 
Rules and regulations of the various associations may help to sup- 
press the symptoms of the disease, but they do not cure it, as the real 
cause remains. The quickest way to remedy all these evils is to take 
a saner view of games and place less emphasis upon them. This may 
be done most effectively by stopping contests with other schools, 
and encouraging play within the walls. 
Our boys enjoy many forms of games, football, basketball, tennis, 
golf, shinney, roller skating, bicycle riding and cross country runs, 
and there are almost no boys in the school who do not participate 
regularly in some of these activities. I will not attempt to describe 
all of these activities, but it may be well to explain the system as it 
applies to football, which may be taken as the type of all. This 
system has been developed by the boys themselves. During the first 
week of the school in September each class selects its class captain. 
For a week or two the captain gives daily practice to all members 
who wish to play, until he is able to select his team. As soon as this
-P-A-G-E-352

  352 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
is done, the boys not selected immediately organize a second team, 
and in the larger classes even a third and sometimes a fourth class 
team, the latter composed of the very small boys. Saturday after- 
noon the first class teams play with one another until the champion- 
ship is settled. There are a few spectators, school boys only, at these 
contests, but not at any practice games. Friday afternoons the sec- 
ond class teams have their championship games. 
The winning class is usually settled by the first of November. 
Class teams immediately disband and a meeting is then held of all 
football players to select the two best players for the captains of 
what they call the “Big Teams.” (Our boys use simple terms). 
These captains then select thirteen players each, and one chooses red 
as his color and the other blue. As soon as the players for the first 
team are selected the remaining boys elect two more captains, who 
again select their players, the one choosing blue and the other red as 
his color. These are known as second teams and each acts as a scrub 
for the big team of the same color. After the big teams have settled 
their championship by a series of three games, the seconds play 
against one another. Then in the same way third and fourth and 
fifth teams are selected, until every boy who wishes to play football 
has an opportunity to do so. There is all the benefit of play, but its 
excesses are reduced to a minimum. 
In the School Review for December, 1909, Mr. Frank B. Wade, 
of the Shortridge School of Indianapolis, has an article urging intra- 
mural sports instead of interscholastic games. At that time his 
school had. only recently adopted the former plan. As a result of 
the change there was a very large increase in the number of boys 
that took part in the various games. Eighty boys regularly played 
baseball, forty did track work, thirty played tennis, and the same 
number joined the fencing class. There was almost immediately a 
gain in good discipline and good scholarship. In a recent letter to 
me he says, among other things: ‘We are still firmly wedded to the 
idea that Shortridge and the system has been working admirably. 
In the last spring term we had four regular nines in our 
aseball league and one of my assistants and I took two squads of 
smaller boys and had a series of second team games, which the boys 
taking part appreciated greatly. . . . We had some seventy- 
five boys actively taking part in baseball all spring. . . . The 
vast majority of our teachers are heartily in sympathy with the new 
conditions and would not like to consider any return to the old type 
of athletics.” 
This plan in the past in our school has developed some excellent 
athletes. One year seven of the Vanderbilt football eleven were
-P-A-G-E-353

prepared for college by us. This has not been true in recent years, 
as our boys now scatter to various colleges, but I frankly confess 
that only a small per cent of them make the college teams. This is 
partly due to the fact that we have no coach, and ball with us does 
not become a serious business, as it does with many of our competi- 
tors, who train their boys to win in interscholastic games, and it is 
also due to the fact that the boy with athletic tendencies selects by 
preference the school that allows match games. 
Summing up, intra-mural sports place a truer, saner emphasis 
upon games. The system gives each player plenty of good, whole- 
some exercise without temptation to overdo or the danger of over- 
strain that is found in interscholastic games. On the mental side, 
play under this plan gives the mental training that play should give, 
and gives it just as acutely as interscholastic games can do, but as it 
demands less time for play, it leaves much more time for other school 
activities. It helps rather than interferes with mental work, as is 
the case with match games. 
It places more accurate emphasis upon winning. Hence there is 
less temptation to unfairness in its various forms, for one’s opponents 
are ofttimes one’s best friends. This sort of play helps the social side 
and it does not blunt the moral perceptions. Its chief advantage, 
however, is that it induces a much larger number of boys to share in 
its benefits. But from my standpoint one of its best results is that 
there is very little to talk about, and when the game is over the boy 
puts away ‘his sweater and his ball and turns to more serious tasks. 
Piay As ReLarep to THE ScHoon Lire or CHILDREN. 
MISS ANNE P. KOLB, NASHVILLE, TENN. 
First, let me say that everything which I may tell you in this 
paper is not entirely original—neither is everything exactly new 
to the majority of you. I am merely giving you the theories of 
some other people and—of mine—which I have found to be sound 
and practical theories, which I have put into use and seen suc- 
ceed. Often certain ideas which great educators have, sound well, 
but, when ordinary individuals try to put them into use, utterly 
fail. Some of the people whose theories I have experimented with 
and found sane enough, for, at least, an ordinary person to put 
into use, are as follows: Frcebel, Hall, Spencer, Dewey, Johnson, 
Bancroft, Cabot and others. 
“What is play?” Frebel tells us “Play is not trivial; it is 
highly serious and of deep significance. Cultivate and foster it, 
23 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
  354 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
oh mother; protect and guide it, oh father. The keen vision of one 
who truly knows human nature—knows the spontaneous play of 
the child discloses the future inner life of the man.” 
A certain familiar old proverb says: “Man is whole only when 
he plays.” And G. Stanley Hall says, “Play is the great agent of 
unity and totalization of body and soul.” 
Then lets ali play, both young and old; begin early in life and 
play until we are too feeble to be even happy. For play is the ex- 
pression of our happiness within. 
Play in the kindergarten. 
Play in the grades. 
Play in the high school. Here let us be careful; don’t let the 
girls of this age think they are too big to play, and, to you teach- 
ers, play with them. 
Play in the colleges. 
If we want the whole man, the whole woman, the well-rounded 
citizen, play. Teach them to play, and play with them. 
And why? Well, lets investigate. Consider the kindergarten. 
Play is the soul and body of the kindergarten. Here we find that 
                                                        
play—and rightly so, for according to Dewey’s Pedagogical Creed 
—which we all live by, “The active side precedes the passive in the 
development of child nature, expression comes before conscious 
impression. Muscular development precedes sensory. * * * * Con- 
scious states tend to project themselves in action.” Hence, give 
small children games involving large activities—leave the finer ad- 
justments to the older child. 
In the kindergarten we use largely the dramatic games; we 
learn by doing; we play train, we play house, we play everything 
that we do. We hear a story, then we do the story. When we 
tell the teacher what we saw coming to school, we act it. So 
everything is a game, and everything is pleasant. Why not carry 
this spirit into the grades, and instead of the old-time mental arith- 
metic drill, play “nimble squirrel, described in Miss Bancroft’s 
book of games? In this and many other ways the game can enter 
into the schoolroom without disturbing the discipline. 
Physical exercises for smaller children may also be made abso! 
lutely recreative by retaining the play element—by the use of 
games; e. g., instead of the dull trunk bending and twisting, play 
cutting wood, play see-saw, etc. Ideas may be gotten from the read- 
ing lesson—history or whatnot. Then, too, folk games and dances 
may be correlated with the ordinary lessons. Thus games may 
 
-P-A-G-E-355
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 855 
be used to impress upon the child certain facts and customs and 
general knowledge, which we teach ordinarily by the regular rou- 
tine, in a pleasanter way. 
Again, let me quote Dr. G. Stanley Hall: “To know a child, we 
must know him in his play.” Teachers, mothers, fathers, take note. 
If you would know your children, play with them. The child is 
really himself in his play—his faults, his weaknesses, his strength, 
are shown in his play. Teach him to play right, and he will live 
right. And you say, how is that? We will see. Let us see how 
games and play may influence a child. 
Active play and games in the fresh air are bownd to develop him 
physically. There is physical activity, fresh air and pleasure; exer- 
cise which in itself is healthy, but when taken unconscious of self 
the good result is doubled. The awkward, ungainly child learns 
to make finer adjustments; he doesn’t tumble down so often; he 
throws the ball in the right direction; he runs faster, he shoots 
’ straighter—in short; he becomes more efficient; he has more nervo- 
muscular development. 
Simply because we have a game, it does not follow that no work 
is done. Mr. C. E. Johnson of the Pittsburg Playground Associa- 
tion, says: “Play involves the hardest of work, a greater output of 
energy than drudgery, just as service does more work than slavery ; 
but the drudgery will be swallowed up in the interest—in the earn- 
estness of the zealous soul, for drudgery is in the mind and heart 
much more than in the amount and kind of work to be done.” 
Our friend Tom Sawyer realized this when he was whitewashing 
the fence. 
Mentally, there is much to say. If plays and games are related 
to our school life, they must needs give mental development. Let 
us see if they aid us here. Notice now the boy or girl plays on 
the school ground. Suppose, for instance, the game be prisoner’s 
base. The player must have courage to take risks and give dares; 
on his face you see the expression of determination to capture the 
other fellow. Or if the game be basket ball, you see he is deter- 
mined to make one more goal to win that game. In other words, 
through games the boy or girl receives that all-important asset— 
the training of the will, And here let us notice what Miss Ban- 
croft says about will training: 
school has very little of this power of inhibition. To see a thing is to want 
“Probably the most valuable of all training through games is that of inhi- 
bition—that power of restraint and self-control which is the highest aspect of 
the will, and the latest to develop. The little child entering the primary  
-P-A-G-E-356
  856 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
it; to want it is to try to get it or do it. He acts impulsively. He does not 
possess the power to restrain movement and to deliberate. It is a great 
trouble with children and should be developed, and not called willfulness.” 
We do not wish to “break a child’s will,” we want to develop it 
and develop his power to inhibit all desires which cause him to dis- 
turb others, or inconvenience others, which cause him to encroach 
upon the rights of others. 
Miss Bancroft says further on this same subject: 
“There is no agency that can so effectually and naturally develop the power 
of inhibition as games. In games of little children there are very few, if any 
restrictions, but as the players grow older, the rules and regulations appear, 
requiring greater self-control—ego, not playing out of one’s turn, not starting 
a race over the line, or until the proper signal; aiming deliberately, instead of 
throwing wildly or haphazard.” 
At the adolescent age, when organized team work is reached— 
where we deal in the fouls and modes of play—it is here that 
power to control the will and to build character begins. It is at 
this age that boys and girls need games. (Girls aren’t getting too 
big to play.) To be able in the emotional excitement of an intense 
game or contest to observe rules and regulations—to choose under 
these circumstances the fair rather than the unfair means of win- 
ning—to act on this choice, is more than the mere knowledge of 
right and wrong—it is the making of character. Children should 
be taught this from the beginning—as grown-ups often need to be 
reminded of these facts. 
It is for the need of such trained and balanced will power that 
our highways of finance are strewn with the wrecks of able men. 
If the love of fair play, a sense of true moral value, and, above all, 
the power and habit of the will to act on these, can be developed 
in our boys and girls, it will mean much for the uplift and better- 
ment of the community and of mankind. You say I claim much for 
games and play; but you play with children and notice them, ob- 
serve them develop. As we have said before, we see the true man 
only when he is at play—the same with the child. 
Socially, now, how do games assist? We all know that they do. 
Let us observe a child who, because of the force of circumstances, 
has been raised alone, has not played with other children. Put him 
with a group of children, and what happens? If it is on the school 
yard, you will find him a looker-on, and if you urge him to join in 
the games, he often does not possess the power to codperate readily 
and pleasantly with other children. 
 
-P-A-G-E-357
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 357 
Many older people lack this, and there is nothing absolutely 
which can place,a person at a greater disadvantage in business or 
society, or, in fact, in any relation of life, than the inability to act 
in harmony with fellow-beings. If you wil notice the children 
closely on your playground, you will often find this to be the case 
—the unsociable, peculiar, disliked little ones, if brought into 
games, become popular with their little friends, when they have 
become cognizant each of the other’s rights. Often, too, you will 
see a timid little one overcome his timidity by taking his turn with 
the others; he inconspicuously feels his wings, as it were, and finds 
that he really can do about as well as other people, and finally he 
overcomes the shrinking from coming forward to do his part. Then, 
too, the bold, selfish child learns that he may not monopolize ali 
opportunities. Children of this type must be noticed and may be 
helped greatly. The wnappreciated child gains self-confidence and 
the admiration of the other children by some special ability, and 
he is wanted as a partner, or is respected as an opponent. 
In games, children should be taught to take defeat without dis- 
couragement, and to win without undue elation. Never allow gloat- 
ing—always have the losing side applaud the winners. 
In these and many other ways the latent powers for social de- 
velopment and coéperation are augmented, and the child is made 
a more efficient member of society. 
In games where team work is prominent, codperation reaches its 
highest point, where self is sacrificed for the interests of the team. 
No one is to star, all are for the team. 
“Every human being—man, woman and child—hero and fisher- 
man, athlete, individual or whatnot, needs the blessing of God 
through three great channels—responsibility, recreation and affec- 
tion. With these any life is happy, in spite of sorrow and pain— 
success or failure,” says Richard C. Cabot. He says further that 
what we want to give children is real life, and if we want to do 
that, give them these three. And to the grown-ups of our America, 
let me say, spell the recreation with a big R. We Americans don’t 
take time enough to play—not fooling away precious time, but true 
recreation, where we forget the troubles of business, the cares of 
home and the disappointments of life. And there are many forms 
of play. Let us consider them as related to the school and college 
life of our young people. 
Now, there is dancing. What more beautiful form of play than 
this, and what more recreative? Not the turkey trot, and the more 
extremely modern and disgusting forms called dancing, which our
-P-A-G-E-358
358 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
young people are indulging in, for the lack, very probably, of the 
knowledge of the truer forms of dancing. In dancing, we get the 
artistic form of athletics, games and play. Can we blame and crit- 
icise the young people for dancing the turkey trot, if they want to 
play and we don’t teach them the best and most beautiful forms 
of play? In most of the larger cities this side has been developed ; 
that is, the dancing of folk dances by the school children and 
playground children; but in our smaller towns and villages and 
rural districts there is a lack. Now, you may say that it will be 
impossible to introduce dancing of any kind in some rural dis- 
tricts, but I think not, as I have had some experience here. If you 
have trouble with the word “dance,” don’t use it. The simple folk 
dances are nothing more than pretty games, often with words to 
the music. And if these could be introduced into our rural dis- 
tricts in the schools, I think the social life would be improved, in 
this way. If you know anything of rural life in this Southland of 
ours, you know there is little recreation or social life for the young 
people outside of, the country school and the country church. If 
you have ever been to a country church “sociable” or “school enter- 
tainment,” you know what they consist of—a saucer of ice cream, 
a recitation, a song, etc. Why not bury our trouble and responsi- 
bility in a merry game? This is being done in some places with 
good results. In one place I happen to know, the church lawns 
are used once or twice in the week for games, folk dances and 
stories, and some young woman of the church meets the children 
there, plays with them, teaches them games, gives just enough su- 
pervision to keep the proper spirit, and lookout for stubbed toes, 
etc., and incidentally, church prosperity. 
Then comes the country school. Why not have an old-time May 
festival or May party, with games and dances and songs, instead 
of scaring half a dozen little ones to death by giving them a speech 
to say on the last day? The same way at Thanksgiving and Christ- 
mas—have a Thanksgiving or harvest festival and a Christmas fes- 
tival. The mothers and fathers will be so interested in seeing their 
little ones perform, and in joining with them in their games, thus 
helping more to make the country school the social center, as every 
school in every community should be. 
Also basket ball and base ball games for the boys with neigh- 
boring schools help to keep up interest in the school. You have no 
idea how many of the fathers will come out to these games. Why, 
down here in Social Circle, Ga., I refereed a game of basket ball 
between their high school boys and the Georgia State Normal School 
 
-P-A-G-E-359
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 359 
boys, and at that game there were nearly 200 people from the country 
around. People came in their‘buggies and wagons, and my! but 
they had a grand time cheering for their boys. The game was a 
good one, and well played as to fairness and clean play. The 8. 
N. 8. boys were beaten, but were good sports and gave a cheer for 
the winners—which was a new idea to them. One old farmer came 
up to me and said: “Well, you are the first woman I ever saw that 
could be fair, and these are the first boys I ever saw lose and then 
yell for the other fellows. Seems to me they are mighty fine boys.” 
Thus the country school is again the social center, and its in- 
fluence for better things is felt. 
The relation of play and games to the college girl and woman is 
interesting, and its good effect upon the college girl is manifold; 
and all colleges of any reputation or standing encourage them in 
connection with the physical education department. Basket ball, 
hockey, tennis, etc., are the favorites. Basket ball played by girls 
within the same school (inter-class games) are very beneficial— 
physically, mentally, morally. It teaches the girl quickness of 
thought, perception and action. If properly supervised and 
coached, generosity toward rivals, loyalty and class spirit, which 
is sometimes lacking in girls’ colleges. It makes the body strong, 
active and graceful. 
But I find that inter-collegiate basket ball for girls is not the 
best thing. Girls are too nervously constituted to stand the strain. 
The nervous excitement makes it impossible for them to study when 
such a game is before them. When a game goes this far, then it is 
past its good use. Hence, the ban upon girls’ sport—they must be: 
carefully supervised and overlooked. Tennis is a good game in 
every way, and with an additional good point; that is, socially. 
Then, another side of the play of college girls may be and is 
being developed in most colleges, and that is dancing; and in that 
connection, festivals and days of celebration; e. g., Smith, Welles- 
ley, Vassar’s Greek games, pageants, etc., which have become an- 
nual affairs. What is more beautiful or more beneficial than these 
beautiful marches, dances and processionals on the green? 
In these celebrations, the departments—art, literature, music and 
physical education—may be correlated with great benefit to the in- 
stitution and the young women. 
Play and games—their effect upon the college man. 
What is a college without a football, baseball or basket ball 
team? Nothing! What would there be to interest the freshman? 
Nothing! I wish that we might take a census of all freshmen who 
 
-P-A-G-E-360
360 . SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
enter college, and find just how many came with the hope of mak- 
ing some team. I believe that everyone of them, with perhaps a few 
exceptions, have this hope and do try out; but that is where our 
colleges fall down. They select the few who are the best, and the 
others go to waste, and with their ambition squashed. 
Some plan should be made for using all college boys in some 
game. They all need the benefits to be derived from games. 
Look at the average football player. He has a physique of which 
most men would be proud. He has the clean, honest look on his 
face; the strong muscles, and the strong, determined mouth. A 
man who plays football can’t be cold-footed, and he must think 
and act quickly. He must be loyal. He must lose self for the good 
of the team. He must codperate. He must learn to take defeat and 
victory gracefully. 
The authorities at West Point and Annapolis consider that foot- 
ball is essential to the all-round education of the men attending 
those institutions, in spite of the fact that each has had a man 
killed in the game. At these two places all men have to play at 
some time. 
In these few words I have tried to make clear to you the fact 
that play and games are vitaily related to school life in all its 
phases. I have hit the ground in high places, and have not said 
half which could have—or might have, been said. But I hope I 
have set you thinking, and if you don’t play games yourself, and 
the boys and girls of your schools haven’t already a place to play, 
and some one to supervise their play, that you will wake up and 
see that you have. 
In the cities, open your school grounds; in the villages, either 
do that or get a vacant lot near. In the country you have plenty 
of the big outdoors. Use it. 
Remember, we are fitting people for life, and if we want well- 
rounded, whole men and women, we must have them play. For 
“Play is not trivial; it is highly serious.” 
A New Aspect or tam Boy Scout MoveMEnt. 
DON CARLOS ELLIS, WASHINGTON, D. C. 
My calling being that of a forester, I naturally regard the Boy 
Scout from the forester’s point of view. I have assisted a very 
little in devising forestry “stunts” for the boys to do and suggest- 
ing forestry lore for him to learn. I have taken a few of the boys 
on “hikes” through the woods, and found them hungry for the in-
-P-A-G-E-361
  
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 361 
teresting things that the forest had to tell them, as well as the 
victuals which they cooked for their noonday meal. I have told 
them of the Forest Ranger, and how he fights fires, and they imme- 
diately began practicing on their own camp fire. And so, when 
the kind invitation was extended me to tell you my views of the 
Boy Scout work, I asked that I might be permitted to speak from 
the forester’s espect and to tell what ideals and what work the 
activities of the forester hold forth as helpful. 
While the Boy Scout movement in its present form is a British 
institution, originated by Sir Baden-Powell in England, and then 
transplanted into this country, the fundamental idea upon which 
it is based is essentially American, for the model after which the 
Boy Scout is made is the pioneer frontiersman of our early West- 
ern civilization. This idea finds its personification in such conspic- 
uous and picturesque figures of the early days of the West as Daniel 
Boone, David Crockett, Buffalo Bill and Kit Carson, men of re- 
sourcefulness and vigor, who blazed the trail for the thousands of 
settlers who were to come after them, fought and trapped and 
hunted beasts of prey, contended with Indians for possession of 
the land, endured the privations of a new and wild country, became 
skilled by long and hard experiences in the arts of scouting, camp- 
ing and woodcraft, and established a standard for keen observa- 
tion, alertness, courage and resourcefulness, which probably has 
not been excelled. 
The frontier scout has long disappeared. In the haunts of the 
Indian and upon the plains where the buffalo roamed, came great 
herds of cattle and bands of many sheep, and the cowboy replaced 
the scout. He rode hard, he was skilled in the use of firearms, he 
knew how to take care of himself in the wilderness, and he became 
the patron saint of many a small boy in the effete East. But as 
civilization has progressed further and further, and the cattle 
ranges have been cut up into farms, the cowboy, too, has begun to 
disappear, and soon this type, too, will live only in memory and 
story, as does the pioneer scout live today only in such romances 
and adventures as Fennimore Cooper’s “Leather Stocking Tales.” 
In the place of the frontiersman and the cowboy, however, a new 
type of scout has arisen, whose life is fully as wild and untram- 
meled, whose need of resourcefulness, skilled observation and train- 
ing are as great as in the case of the scouts of the older days. He is 
the Forest Ranger. But there is this great difference: the pioneer 
scouts were the scouts of war; they led armed soldiers to fight the 
hostile Indian bands; the Forest Ranger is the scout of peace, the

guardsman of the great forests of the nation, which stretch for 
hundreds of miles across the mountains of the Western states, owr 
forests. He potects them from fire and trespass and vandalism. 
Like the Boy Scout, the Forest Ranger must be prepared to meet 
all sorts of unexpected emergencies. He must be loyal to his 
country and to the service for which he works; he must be brave in 
the face of many great dangers; he must be obedient to his superi- 
ors, helpful at all times to the public who use the national forests 
for recreation, travel or business; and, with all, he must be cour- 
teous and kind. He is expected, in very truth, to be the ideal Boy 
Scout grown up. His life is an arduous one, though it is happy 
because it is made up of service to his fellowmen. In: stress of 
emergency, when forest fires are being beaten back by every power 
at his command, he may work twenty-four hours out of the day. 
At other times his work is much more pleasant and wholesome. He 
gathers seed from the trees and plants them in a protected nursery 
among the hills, and tenderly raises the young seedlings until he 
may set them out upon some barren hillside; he builds trails, wagon 
roads and bridges; he sees to it that more cattle or sheep do not 
graze upon the ranges in the forests than these ranges can properly 
support; he superintends logging operations; assists other forest 
officers in their scientific investigations; he hunts down predatory 
animals; directs travelers on the way and courteously warns them 
that if they leave their camp fires unextinguished or are careless 
in other ways with fire, they may start a great conflagration in 
the forest which may consume many thousand dollars’ worth of 
timber and endanger human life. Astride his horse or on foot, or 
perhaps in a launch or canoe, he patrols his forest during the 
season of fire danger, and often climbs high up to his lookout sta- 
tions among the mountain tops to scan the surrounding country 
through his field-glass for the tell-tale column of smoke. The 
story of a week of the Ranger’s life is very well told in a humorous 
little poem written by a man, himself an officer of the Forest Serv- 
ice, and I shall take the liberty of reading it to, you: 
| The Forest Ranger’s life is joy, 
His days are spent in play, 
His weeks are fun without alloy ; 
His months one happy round-de-lay. 
But just to keep himself in trim, 
He works a bit each day.

  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 363 
Monday sees a mile of trail 
Blocked by a landslide’s fall. 
He mends a couple of bridges frail, 
And cuts the grade on the canyon wall. 
But aside from putting that trail in shape 
He does not work at all. 
Tuesday finds him full of sand, 
And clean as a chimney-sweep. \\ 
He rides ten miles to the driveway stand 
And tallies ten thousand head of sheep. 
But seeing this trifling duty done, 
He spends the day in sleep. 
Wednesday morning some tourists came, 
Loaded with ignorance, matches and gall; 
Well primed to set the forest aflame, 
_ And burn the timber, straight and tall. 
He trailed them till they were safe in bed, 
But otherwise did not work at all. 
Thursday a couple of thieves he caught 
Filing fraudulent claims to get the wood. 
This day’s work almost came to naught, 
For they were friends of Senator Goode. 
But after the gang was safe in jail, 
He loafed as a ranger should. 
Friday he made a timber sale, 
With a certified check as security. 
He figured the stand by the decimal scale, 
And branded U. S. on every tree. 
So, while he might have done some work, 
He passed the day in ecstacy. 
And Saturday, like the rest of the week, 
He played at tennis, and golf, and ball. 
He shod his pony, cleaned the creek, 
Burned some little, and built a stall. 
But, generally speaking, the livelong day, 
He wrote his reports—that’s all. 
The motto of the Forest Ranger might very properly be the 
same as that of the Boy Scout: “Be Prepared.” The need of 
preparation is evidenced, even long before he begins his work, for 
the examination through which he must pass in order to become a 
Forest Ranger is a severe test of his preparation. He must know 
the country in which he wants to work; he must know how to cook, 
to camp, to take care of himself in other ways; he must know how    
-P-A-G-E-364
  364 . EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
to pack a horse and throw a diamond hitch; he must know some- 
thing of lumbering or forestry, and he must pass an examination 
in the regulations laid down for the administration of the national 
forests. If he can pass successfully in these various subjects and 
secures a position, he is given a six months’ trial before he becomes 
a permanent forest officer, and during this trial he will have opor- 
tunity further to demonstrate his ability, his preparedness. If he 
shows that he has a practical knowledge of the things I have men- 
tioned; that, in addition, he can shoot straight, that he cannot 
easily be lost in the woods, and has the courage, the skill and the 
judgment to fight forest fires and to handle men under him; if he 
can supervise logging operations upon the national forests and see 
that the terms of the lumberman’s contract with the Government 
to prevent waste and guard against fire are carried out; if he 
proves himself a good engineer, so that he can build his cabin and 
string telephone lines, and, besides all this, if he can be courteous 
and just in dealing with the people who use the national forests, 
he will make a good Ranger, and will have the privilege of working 
for the people of the United States at about one-third the salary 
which he earns. As a matter of fact, the general attitude of the 
forest officers with whom I have come in contact is that if they do 
not earn considerably more than their salaries they are not worthy 
of the trust which their calling imposes upon them. I do not wish 
to appear to be raising the Forest Rangers to the hero class. They 
are plain, ordinary men, with all plain men’s failings. They have 
come from every walk of life, and in their ranks the rough moun- 
taineer rubs shoulders with the college graduate; but their calling 
and their training, and the cause for which they work, ennoble 
them. The one idea which permeates the whole service and quick- 
ens the pulse of every loyal worker in it, is the idea of public 
service, and their slogan is: “For the Forest Service and for the 
people of the Nation.” Let me give you one concrete example of 
how this spirit manifests itself under severe trial. In the forest 
great fires in the fall of 1910, when the red demon swept before the 
wind over thousands of acres of national forest land and left them 
charred and burned, Ranger Pulaski, who had been vainly striving 
at the head of about forty other men to fight back the ever-advanc- 
ing flames, suddenly found that the fire had surrounded him and 
his band. He undertook to lead them out, but the heat was intense, 
smoke choked and blinded him, and with the men behind him fran- 
tic with fear and pain, and crowding and pushing, he could not 
find a path to safety. He told them to remain where they were
-P-A-G-E-365
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 365 
until he reconnoitered a little. He soaked a gunny sack with water 
and with this over his head, dashed off through the burning timber, 
He found a way out. He could have easily escaped himself and 
abandoned his men, but that would not be true to his ideals and the 
traditions of the service. He went back for them and led them to 
a tunnel in an abandoned mine. The flames were raging in the 
forest about them. He drove the men to the tunnel and ordered 
them to lie down with their faces to the ground. For several hours 
Pulaski stood at the mouth of the tunnel, with drawn revolver, 
forcing the men, most of whom were foreigners, to remain in the 
cave. Many of them, crazed with their sufferings, attempted time 
and time again to force their way out into the burning forest, where 
there would have been no escape from death. As it was, six of the 
men died of suffocation in the tunnel, but the Ranger by his hero- 
ism had saved thirty-four lives. That he himself survived, fighting 
maddened men on one side and fire on the other, when other men 
in a safer place in the tunnel died, is a tribute to the Ranger’s 
hardihood and preparedness. He sank to the ground toward the 
end. His eyesight was long in danger, but was ultimately saved. 
It is not my purpose to seek recruits from the Boy Scouts to the 
ranks of the forest service. There are already many more appli- 
cants for the positions than there are positions to fill. I wish 
merely to suggest the Forest Ranger as an exemplar after which 
the Boy. Scout may pattern. The Ranger does in his daily work 
many of the things which the Boy Scout is required to do in his 
play, and which make more of a man of him and direct into useful 
channels his superabundant energies that are apt to run amuck 
with a boy in his teens. 
The work of the forester, in addition to offering an ideal toward 
which the Boy Scout may work, also suggests many concrete ac- 
tivities which may be used by the Boy Scout in his studies and 
in his “stunts.” A knowledge of many subjects connected with the 
forest is already required as part of the Scout’s regular work— 
woodcraft, elementary surveying, map-making and identification of 
trees. He should also learn many things not to do. When he goes 
into the forest he should learn to do the least possible damage to the 
trees; he should be taught how and where to build a camp fire and 
how to extinguish it, in order that the flames may not spread into 
a forest fire. The Boy Scouts in some states have already rendered 
valuable seryice in preventing forest fires by reporting them when 
found, and even in extinguishing them, and in some instances the 
Boy Scout organizations are an actual part of the state fire protec- 
tive systems, and are doing ex¢ellent work.

I am an ardent believer in the Boy Scout movement: I believe 
that it holds forth great possibilities for improving the quality of 
our citizenship, in shaping high ideals in our boys, and in teaching 
them much useful and helpful knowledge, and I hope that I and 
the service to which I belong may be of some help to the teachers 
and others who are active in the Boy Scout work, for you and I 
and the Boy Scout workers are all directed toward accomplishing 
the same end—the well-being of society. 
Department of Art and Drawing. 
The minutes of the last meeting, at Houston, Texas, not having 
been sent to the secretary, the proceedings of that meeting were re- 
counted by the President of the Department of Art and Drawing, 
Prof. Ellsworth Woodward. 
Miss Preston Pope Bruce, manager of Arts and Crafts, Louis- 
yille, Ky., was introduced by the President. Miss Bruce’s paper 
was convincing and practical. She showed several vases and tapes- 
tries of good design. Her paper was ably and entertainingly dis- 
cussed. by Miss Nina Benedict, teacher of Art in the Girls’ High 
School, Louisville, Ky., who dwelt upon the disciplinary value and 
reasonable activities the arts and crafts have upon the student. 
President Woodward apologized for the unavoidable absence of 
Prof. W. C. A. Hammell, director of Department of Manual Arts 
and Physics, State Normal and Industrial College, Greensboro, 
N. C., and submitted his paper on “Relation of Art to Manual 
Training.” 
Mr. Chas. Sneed Williams, artist, Louisville, Ky., was next in- 
troduced. His paper dealt on “The Function of the Artist in So- 
ciety.” His paper aroused an enthusiasm and an uplifting feeling 
and desire for “beauty” in all things. He said “the function of the 
artist in society should be that of a worker and not a theorist; 
that the reward received would be the satisfaction that his work 
would endure as long as men need its healing touch and feel its 
quickening influence.” 
Miss Alice Cane, teacher of art, Girls’ High School, Louisville, 
Ky., led the discussion, emphasizing the needs of the people for the 
artist’s influence and work. Of the responsibility between “Art 
and the Public,” Mr. Frederick Perkins of New York responded in 
a happy manner, dwelling upon “beauty in art,” looking for beauty, 
working for beauty, finding beauty in all things, in common things.

Prof. Wm. H. Varnum, Assistant Professor of Design, Univer- 
sity of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis., was introduced and read an able 
paper on “Pedagogic Basis of Design and Its Value in the School 
System.” The discussion of this paper was led by Prof. Lewis Ba- 
con, Supervisor Manual Training Department, Louisville, Ky. The 
thoughts expressed in Mr. Varnum’s paper brought out many spon- 
taneous expressions on the utilitarianism of design, on the fitness 
of design to materials, the correlation of the design and the things 
to be decorated, the technique, and the principles of design. 
Prof. Ellsworth Woodward, in his genial manner, thanked the 
speakers and the audience for their presence, and the meeting was 
adjourned. Lena Hitiericu, Secretary. 
Tue EpucatioNaL VALUE OF THE ARTS AND Crarts MovyEMENT. 
MISS PRUSTON POPE BRUCE, LOUISVILLE, KY. 
Before discussing the educational value of the arts and crafts 
movement, it would be well to note the definition of the words. 
Art is from Artem, skill, skill in fitting or joining; it is akin to 
artus, a joint; the combination or modification of things to adapt 
them to a given end; the employment of given means to effect a 
given purpose. Mr. Mills says “Art is but the employment of the 
powers of nature for an end.” Yes, but the employment is the art. 
That use or employment of the natural elements is precisely the 
function of the intelligence and the will, which differs from nature 
in its proper sense, as the active differs from the passive. Thus we 
see that any one doing his work well and carefully, is an artist, 
provided that there is intelligence behind the work. 
Craft means a trade or occupation, or employment requiring the 
exercise of especial skill or dexterity, especially of manual skill, a 
handicraft. The members of a trade collectively is called a guild. 
We find that the words arts and crafts mean somewhat the same, 
only the artist must have intelligence back of his work. Many a 
craftsman has only dexterity. It is the intellectual and manual 
development carried to a high degree that produces the object really 
worthy of the name arts and crafts work. 
On the continent of Europe the word artist is used in a broader 
sense than in this country. An actor, a singer, musician, painter, 
is never spoken of as a great actor, painter, musician, etc., but as a 
great artist. The foyer of the Theater Francais, for those who 
take in the play is spoken of as the Foyer des Artists. 
The Arts and Crafts movement is today by the majority of people 
greatly misunderstood, probably not by this audience. Many peo-  
-P-A-G-E-368

ple think what they call “arts and crafts work,” as if it was a cer- 
tain kind of work, is something unusual and of rough workman- 
ship, especially if it is on green copper framed in rough wood. I 
have begun to hate the term, having so often heard it misapplied. 
I was much amused when a man tried to sell me a rough metal 
plaque framed almost in kindling wood, saying, “Miss Bruce, you 
should like this; it is very crafty.” The term, viewed from the cor- 
rect standpoint, means, of course, work of the most perfect crafts- 
manship, such as only a thorough training of eye and hand can 
execute. A good craftsman must of necessity be well trained. 
The period of the greatest craftsmanship was the renaissance, 
and one of the greatest artists of that time was Benvenuto Cellini. 
What craftsman of today has his range of work? He executed 
with the same care, statues such as the Perseus of the Bargello, 
down to the minutest piece of jewelry. Those who have not read 
that incomparable autobiography of Cellini should do so. Such 
workmanship as his demands training of eye, hand and brain. If 
our workmen today would study the masters of the renaissance, 
what an improvement there would be in their work. I wish to 
impress on all young workers the value of study and application. 
There is but one road to excellence—hard work. I am sure that 
Professor Woodward and his excellent staff will tell you that no 
one learns in a few months to make the beautiful Newcomb pot- 
tery. When a student in Paris, I heard Courtois tell a girl that 
she did not draw well enough to paint. She answered: “I have 
drawn a year without painting.” His reply was, “Rixens and I 
drew for ten years, eight hours a day and often at night, before 
painting.” They were considered among the best draftsmen in 
Paris. It is this training that has made the greatness of the French 
school. William Morris and his coterie were the founders of the 
present arts and crafts movement. Then they were not called 
craftsmen, but artisans. The work of Morris had a very personal 
beginning. He took a house at Woolwich and enlisted the aid of 
Rosetti in decorating it, but they could find nothing that they cared 
for. This was the early Victorian period (may that style never 
return). So they decided to make their own furniture, wall paper, 
drapery and all that they needed. They were so pleased with the 
result that a company was formed in 1861. “We are organizing a 
company,” Rosetti says, “for the production of furniture and deco- 
rations of all kinds, for the sale of which we are going to open an 
actual shop.” ‘This enterprise proved very successful, much to the 
chagrin of the ordinary tradesmen. The men concerned were Mad- 
 
-P-A-G-E-369
    
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 369 
dox Brown, Brune-Jones, Rosetti, and, prime-mover and worker, 
William Morris. Each one contributed two or three articles, at 
his own expense, for the stock. They endeavored to make prices 
as reasonable as possible, but made no effort to compete with the 
large stores. (I should say shops, for this was in England.) This 
was the revival of artistic cotton linen printing in England. There 
had been, in the eighteenth century, wonderful designs made for 
cotton prints, in which the Chinese influence was much felt, at 
Jouy, France. There is a revival of the same designs today. They 
are always spoken of as “les T'oiles dJouy.” Frequently the very 
same wood blocks are used. Most of them were printed by hand. 
Then as now some very beautiful work is done in Kent. Following 
these charming designs, there are being made today for cottons and 
linens, many that are very beautiful and interesting, and the print- 
ing is excellent. You find the Oriental influence was felt at this 
same time, also in the work of Chippendale and others in England. 
This period of his work is called Chinese Chippendale, and is much 
in vogue today. 
William Morris’ philosophy was “to give pleasure in the things 
they must perforce use, that is one great office of decoration; to give 
people pleasure in the things they must perforce make, that is the 
other use of it.” It is this feeling that constitutes the charm of the 
Artistic Crafts. William Morris was democratic. It was at a tea 
given by him for his socialist friends that I had the pleasure of 
meeting him, but I assure you that it was with much pleasure Mrs. 
T. P. O’Connor and I left the guests to visit the studio with Mr. 
Morris and his daughter. This was when he was working in stain 
glass and one of the wonderful windows was in the studio. 
The Arts and Crafts movement has always been democratic. It 
proclaims to the world that beauty, skill and education are for all, 
and that common things should be made beautiful and the beautiful 
universal. The careful understanding work of the craftsman is 
uplifting and broadening, while the man who merely feeds a 
machine or makes only one part of an article has his mind dwarfed. 
When applied to concrete materials and turned to practical ends, 
art becomes craftsmanship. The desire for perfection in work is 
rapidly increasing. It is no longer necessary to buy costly 
articles, and especially fabrics, to get good color and design. One 
feature of all Arts and Crafts guilds and technical schools is that 
work is sold. Instinctively more effort is put forth when the 
article worked on is to be put to use, and when it is found that some 
one is willing to buy it. It is not the money that gives inspiration, 
24  
-P-A-G-E-370
  870 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
but the knowledge that some one else appreciates our work. I 
once asked a very talented water colorist why she did so little 
work. ‘The answer was, “What is the use of painting pictures to 
be put in a portfolio?” Competition also makes for greater per- 
fection. 
One great benefit of the Arts and Crafts movement is apparent 
in what it is doing for children. It has caused a decided change 
in the character of the schoolroom itself. Children are now given 
reproductions of good pictures and statuary to look at in place of 
bare walls; in some schools the furniture is of a character to 
improve the taste; and an effort is made to increase their powers 
of observation of the beautiful and correct; their eyes and hands 
are constantly trained to weave, which teaches the understanding 
of fabrics; to work in metals, which teach the uses of metals; to 
mold pottery, which not only trains the eye but the hands. In 
all ages nations have pressed their individuality through pottery. 
The relationship of tribes has been traced through the resemblance 
of it and archeologists consider the knowledge of it of the greatest 
importance. 
One valuable human lesson gained is that by studying their 
industries we have a greater insight into the life of the peasants 
of foreign nations. Having no such class in this country, we have 
few national industries. In Kentucky we have hand-weaving 
retained in the mountains. 
Children of the laboring class who have this technical training 
when they enter the factory or workshop make more intelligent 
workmen and women than those who have not been so fortunate. 
Professor Zeublin says: “The art school which has perhaps 
made the greatest name through an actual product is the Art 
Department of the Tulane University, at New Orleans, from which 
comes the delightful and attractive Newcomb pottery.” 
The Arts and Crafts movement has a refining influence upon chil- 
dren as well as adulis. Every one is more contented in a room 
with attractive surroundings. If a room is bare, badly kept and 
in ugly colors, our manners even are not so good. All nerve spe- 
cialists acknowledge the effect of surroundings, especially colors. 
Children are not apt to deface a good wall paper, while there is 
something irresistible to their destructive fingers about plain 
plaster walls. I always feel impelled to write on one myself. 
Training as a painter or sculptor has a different effect from that 
of a craftsman. The picture must be independent of the material ; 
the thought alone should govern it. Where, as in a decoration, 
 
-P-A-G-E-371
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 871 
the material must be one of the suggestions of the thought, its use 
must govern the design. The greatest craftsmen are those who 
recognize the limitations of the material employed, and make care- 
ful designs before working in that material. I consider it essen- 
tial that a designer should learn the practical way of carrying out 
the work for which he designs. Nearly all good workers have a 
broad education. They cannot do the best work without this foun- 
dation. 
If the Arts and Crafts movement did nothing more than train 
us to appreciate the wonderful work of the past, and see the bad 
points of the work of the middle of the last century, or rather the 
latter half, a great benefit should be acknowledged. 
Art IN Its Revation To MANUAL TRAINING. 
WILLIAM C, A. HAMMEL, 
We no longer think of art as a disembodied spirit; nor do we 
grant that it breathes in painting and sculpture only. It becomes 
a living thing, full of strength and vital meaning in architecture 
and in those constructive crafts which, because of their dependence 
upon the same basic laws as those governing architecture, are 
called architectural arts. 
It is with these architectural arts that manual training concerns 
itself most intimately. There are but few arts which are not 
manual arts. In the periods richest in art production, there was 
no distinction made between the now so-called fine arts and the 
manual or applied arts. Painting in its earlier history was 
strictly an applied art, and sculpture was used only in direct refer- 
ence to architecture. There is no reason for distinction now, the 
same fundamental laws regulating all phases of art. The dis- 
tinction which came to exist was of slow growth and is doubtless 
in some measure due to the collection and segregation of pictures 
and statuary, as a sort of gentry of art, into galleries; while the 
practical manual arts, the applied arts, being too busily at work 
each in its own appointed sphere of usefulness to attend the gather- 
ing, found themselves relegated to the background, like the despised, 
neglected step-sister, with never a dream of a prince. 
If the applied arts by any chance were gathered together, it was 
as a respectable middle class in a historical museum or other 
strictly educational asylum. The change of attitude toward the 
applied arts is very evident in the more democratic assemblages 
of today to be seen in galleries and museums, where, caste elimi-
-P-A-G-E-372
  372 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
nated, the practical arts are gathered together under the same roof 
with the fine arts—whole rooms of furniture illustrating definite 
historical periods and styles of workmanship, tapestry, pottery, 
silver work, jewelry, stained glass, dwelling together in harmony 
with old masters in oil and marble, whose dignity has suffered not 
a whit from the proximity of unaccounted associates. 
A generation or two ago the only recognized art outside the 
sanctuary of the gallery, the only art which penetrated into life, 
was what the daughter brought home from boarding school—the 
erayon sketches and oil paintings in extravagantly ornate gilt 
frames hung in the front parlor and exhibited with pride to admir- 
ing visitors. The only craft really dignified as an art was the 
modeling of fruits and flowers in wax. These had no use; they 
were ostensibly and frankly gallery pieces snugly reposing under 
the glass case on the marble-top table; while beyond the door, 
weaving, hand sewing, cross stitching, cabinet making and other 
useful arts were patiently and dutifully practiced. Nobody 
thought of these as arts because they were useful in every-day life. 
Now, just as the feeble flame of these humbler arts is about to 
flicker and go out, we rush to snatch them from total extinction, 
revive them and elevate them to a high place to shine as examples 
for modern workmen to emulate and as worthy representatives of 
the spirit of a now almost decadent artist-craftsmanship. 
How much of the transfiguration of the manual or practical arts 
is due to the comparatively recent introduction of manual training 
into the educational system, it would hardly be judicious to say, 
especially in face of the fact that manual training began with piece- 
work, the making of patterns and joints—mere exercises in skill and 
accuracy. 
It is unquestionably to William Morris and his disciples, who 
saw the ugliness to which we were tending, that we owe the revival 
of faith in the dignity and beauty possible in the applied arts. 
That manual training has already and so willingly broadened the 
scope of its activity is evidence of the pervading influence of Morris, 
whose belief in the arts of life, in the oneness of all arts, in art of 
the people, for the people and by the people, has furnished the creed 
of the manual training teacher of today. 
To reach broadly into the application of the arts of every-day 
life, to create and stimulate an understanding and an appreciation 
of the principles of all art is today the province and privilege of 
manual training. Manual training is no longer finger calisthenics 
alone, the mere exercise of motor activities and the development of 
 
-P-A-G-E-373

t 
the brain through the hand along general lines. It is all this, it 
is true, and it is something more—it is the application of the better 
developed brain to better judgment in matters of art. Through a 
knowledge of design and of the difficulties and possibilities in 
various materials it should give an appreciation of good design and 
appropriate use in all forms of the practical arts. Work in the 
crafts leads into an endless avenue of related interests, and in the 
simple words of one whose vision was enlarged rather late in life 
by taking up one of the crafts, “You certainly do see more when you 
do things.” 
We admire a painting of a Dutch interior; we like the homliness, 
the harmony, the focal bits of color. The interior was beautiful in 
itself, but it was the painter who opened our eyes to the beauty. 
We had thought it poor and plain, before. ‘“We’re made so,” says 
Browning, “that we love first when we see them painted, things we 
have passed a hundred times nor cared to see.” The artist’s eye, 
the artist’s appreciation is what we need. It is not the deftness 
of his brush nor the colors on his palette we ought most to envy; 
the painter’s insight, his judgment, his well-sustained assurance, 
are what we require as working tools in whatever medium we work. 
We love the pictures of simple interiors, but lack the judgment and 
courage to apply that simplicity in our own household decoration. 
The larger vision of the craftsman is along a vista of arts kin- 
dred to his own, and all arts are kindred. Does he make a vase 
of clay—he considers not only the possibilities of the material with 
which he is working, the form of the vase and its ornamentation 
according to the laws of design, but he considers as well its uses— 
what kinds of flowers it may best contain, in what surroundings 
it may properly be placed. Does he stencil a scarf—his thought 
does not end with the design and coloring, but projects itself to a 
consideration of the gown with which it is worn and to the com- 
plexion of the wearer. And so on, from the intensive to the exten- 
sive, linking each thing made with a vision of a certain definite 
suitable use. With manual training classes manned now by 
teachers who are artists in the big sense of the word, we may hope 
with some reason that every artisan, every manufacturer and every 
home-maker of the future may come to think in terms of art, apply- 
ing its principles unhesitatingly to every-day needs. 
No amount of utilitarianism will reflect discredit upon the fine 
arts or do injury to the artist. Mr. Leslie Miller, in addressing 
the National League of Handicraft Societies, declared he had no 
patience with those unsuccessful painters who decry the lack of art

appreciation in America, while they, penniless, go on painting easel 
pictures. He would suggest that a commission be established to 
engage for a compensation such painters as were willing to dis- 
tribute themselves among the smaller towns throughout the count- 
try where they might decorate civic and municipal buildings, court- 
houses, churches, with appropriate rural paintings and otherwise 
lend aid in furthering the art progress of the town. 
“When we care for art sufficiently,” says Prior, “to summon her 
from her State prison house of exhibition and galleries, to live again 
a free life among us in our own homes, she will appear as a con- 
trolling force.” It is the duty of the manual training teacher so 
to summon her before the mass of the people as represented in his 
classes, lead her into their homes, and give to her the right to 
become a controlling force. In the very nature of schoolroom 
instruction we cannot hope to make of our manual training classes 
a body of skilled craftsmen, but we can give to them, aside from the 
knowledged psychological and pedagogical increment of the train- 
ing, something tangible and useful, something material to be applied 
in their civic and domestic lives, something that will make not only 
their world a pleasanter place in which to live, but that will also 
add much to the sum total of beauty in life’s every-dayness. 
However much we may wish for the reincarnation of the ideal 
craftsmanship of the middle ages, we must acknowledge the soy- 
ereignty in this day of the machine. Though we cannot restore the 
reign of the handicrafts, we can, through the demand of the pur- 
chasing public, influence the quality and character of manufac- 
tured articles, granting to these when good preference over poor 
hand work. 
In architecture, landscape gardening, interior decorating, fur- 
nishings, and dress, such instruction can be given, not necessarily 
technical, as would make it impossible for the next generation to 
commit the blunders that sometimes make our cities, our homes, 
and our dress a veritable burlesque on art. See the hybrid types 
of hideous and vulgar architecture which stand as horrible exam- 
ples in almost every city; the sky scrapers bespeaking a boom in 
the little country towns; the raw, new colonial mansions, elegant 
with massive columns combined with promiscuous samples of sev- 
eral other styles of architecture, all on a fifty-foot lot; the houses 
and walls built of stone brought from a distance at great expense 
into a clay country where not only economy but a sense of fitness 
would dictate the use of brick; the painted cast-iron angel over a 
fearfully decorated cast-iron drinking fountain where a simple

stone bowl would less offend man and better serve beast; the tree- 
less streets walled in instead with telegraph poles; the silly stock 
monuments insulting rather than honoring our war heroes who 
need no further multiplying of those offences to perpetuate their 
glory. 
Look into the homes at the cheap, tawdry Louis XV and pompa- 
dour furniture and draperies cheek by jow! with hard lined mission 
and golden oak sportive in scroll work and glued-on carvings; the 
setting, grotesquely figured and highly colored wall papers and 
carpeting; the colored glass window panes; the tortured designs of 
lighting fixtures; the china hand painted in naturalistic pictures 
of quail, trout, roses and Napoleons; the lace curtains obscuring 
instead of defining the windows, and mopping the floor with 
unnecessary and superfluous length. Note the gowns that have 
the sanction of the mode of the day. We smile a superior smile at 
the crinolined captivity of a by-gone day, saying it must indeed 
have been an age of meekness and mildness which would suffer a 
woman to let down over her head a cage of steel wire for the sake 
of fashion, and yet today we complacently allow a so-called costume 
designer to stretch a yard or two of cloth about a figureless man- 
nikin, talk much of what he calls “line,” neglecting to reckon at all 
with locomotion, and then dictate that woman shall live, move, and 
have her being in the outrageous garment he has planned. ‘The 
portly dowager and the slender damsel unquestionably attempt 
identical styles; the blonde and the brunette both wear Alice blue 
and Nell rose just as prevailing politics afford an excuse and a 
name for some new fancy. 
If the manual training teacher does not make it his business to 
help improve the public taste and judgment, to do what he can to 
readjust these misfits and make them unthinkable in the next gen- 
eration, there is no other to look after them systematically. With 
hundreds of future citizens daily within the range of his influence, 
if he is not helping to institute an intelligent crusade for better 
things, he is missing the most fruitful opportunity of his calling. 
If he can do something to cure the congenital case of colonial 
columns in a century where so few of the characteristics of a past 
and outgrown civilization remain, where a Georgian mansion with 
but one servant and that one soiled, slovenly and incompetent, is 
to say the least an incongruity; if he can show his community how 
to plan for their own honest needs, unincumbered with a desire for 
display; if he can cause the business man of the next generation 
to build unselfishly for the larger civic beauty. rather than for the

conspicuousness of his own establishment; if he can make him see 
the investment in the altruism of planting trees and leaving open 
an occasional city block for parking; if he can convince the home- 
maker that suits of furniture bought through a catalogue and gath- 
ered together into rooms lined and carpeted in unspeakable combi- 
nations of colors and designs, can never make a house either home- 
like or beautiful; if he can make her feel that the old room of per- 
haps nondescript style can be redeemed by the judicious treatment 
of walls, rugs and hangings in soft neutral tones, giving a harmo- 
nious, time-mellowed dignity to the whole, and will be far better 
than the room garishly new, copied from a section in the show 
rooms of the average furniture store; if he can instill into this 
home-maker an aversion for the onyx table, and the display front 
china closet; if he can influence her to cast into outer darkness the 
superfluous bric-a-brac, the sea shells, souvenirs and card-party 
prizes for which the otherwise useless parlor cabinet, like the what- 
not of old, was bought; if he can, in a word, urge her to keep only 
real needs steadily before her to the exclusion of all imitative, 
envied, ill-considered acquisitions in house furnishings; if he can 
implant a habit of wholesome restraint and sober second thought 
in all temptations to emulate the prosperous looking but mortgaged 
neighbor; if in her dress he can call attention to the worth of indi- 
viduality, to the suitability of certain types of clothing only to 
definite times and places, and the total unsuitability of some types 
to any time or place; if he can dissuade the coming man from riot- 
ous cravats and socks, from “the sunset colored vest and purple 
tie’—if the manual training teacher will do all these things and 
the many more that will naturally suggest themselves, then will 
the architect ox the future devise a saner, more American style of 
architecture better suited to the exigencies of modern life; the 
manufacturer will no longer put upon the market worm-eaten, jig- 
saw furniture to catch the eye and the hard-earned savings of peo- 
ple of moderate means; he will find no sale for the wildly figured 
draperies, the emphatic carpets, the elaborately modeled and nick- 
eled stoves, the encrusted silver never to be kept clean and bright, 
the cut glass, neither beautiful or practical, with which he is flood- 
ing the homes of today; he will have no chance to sell clothes fit 
only for a musical comedy and jewels that are at home nowhere 
except upon an odalisque. 
As in all else in life, the demand regulates the supply; so, also, 
when the demand for cheap ugliness is shut off, the supply will be 
likewise shut off. As in sanitation, hygiene, food, we are demand-

ing better things and with intelligence, so with intelligence we may 
demand better things of the artisan and the manufacturer. It is 
the manual training teacher who, equipped with a practical knowl- 
edge of the vital features of all art, with sound judgment and good 
taste, who must furnish this intelligence to the boys and girls of 
today as their working tool for a share in the bettering of the 
future. 
How persistently in each generation do we resist and resent 
enlightenment! The manual training teacher may expect to find 
opposition to combat against, if in nothing else than the assurance 
of the manufacture who has the field and the capital to maintain it. 
But public opinion is mightier than these and public taste will in 
the end assert itself. The manual training teacher should be the 
torch bearer at the head of the ranks of future citizens, future city 
and home-makers. He can help to fight a good fight with commer- 
cialism and lead commercial designers into more honest efforts to 
make things not merely to sell but to satisfy the people’s real desire 
for better things. If the manual training teacher has knowledge, 
let him permit others to light their candles by it, and so cultivate 
in his community, at least, a sense of beauty and niceness of obser- 
vation, and so do his. part to revive the spirit of the day when art 
pervaded all the things of life and art artisanship were one. 
Tun Funcrion of THE ARTIST IN Society. 
CHARLES SNEED WILLIAM, LOUISVILLE, KY. 
As all true art is practical in that it satisfies a real need, the 
function of the of the artist in society or his relation to that body 
should be considered, I take it, in a practical way as his relation to 
his own time or his own people. Principally his relation in the 
South is that of a pioneer—a thankless lot at best, for in the nature 
of things the pioneer is ahead of his time and is subjected to all the 
trials and privations of his highest hard calling. 
Theoretically, the sole aim and endeavor of the artist should be 
the culture of that finest flower of our civilization—its art. But 
practically, and perhaps unfortunately, we must drop our fine 
theorizing and remember that if the artist pioneer is to accomplish 
anything but his own destruction, he must practice the fine art of 
self-preservation at the same time of his efforts for social better- 
ment. If the measure he takes to obtain a livelihood demands all 
his attention and energy, leaving nothing for more unselfish labors, 
we must blame not only him but the conditions that cramp his large 
usefulness. ‘
-P-A-G-E-378
    378 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
His relation to the world should be in several ways: first and 
foremost through his work; then through his efforts to secure good 
art for the people and cultivate their interest in it. It is obviously 
impossible to lay down any art rules on so complex a subject. But 
the artist’s general relation to society can be catalogued under one 
or both of these heads—his artistic productions and his teaching 
and influence. 
To produce good art is unquestionably an artist’s chief aim—his 
reason for being. This demands an appreciation from the public 
without which he fails utterly. Only too rarely one rises up 
strong enough to override all difficulties and conquer all neglect. 
In the main, when the odds grow too heavy the pioneer simply 
ceases to pioneer—that is all. The people are the lovers at tort. 
If we persist in employing our interests in purely materialistic 
endeavor or in the lighter social matters; if we burn all our tapers 
before the altars of provincial men of affairs and small-pond poli- 
ticians; if we continue to neglect our Poes, our Laniers, our 
Whistlers (for Whistler was half a Southerner and claimed to be 
wholly one), is it any wonder we have so few of them? 
Henry James, I think, speaks of a certain air of weakness char- 
acterizing our Southern States. While the statement rankles as 
prejudiced and unjust in the face of the strength the South has put 
forth time and again, to some degree it does describe our accom- 
plishment in art. We are overproductive of the dilettant, that 
most prejudiced and cock-sure and least useful complication. We 
rise easily enough to a point of fair amateurish accomplishment, 
and except for a few brilliant exceptions, there we stop. In saying 
this I hope I am not forgetful of the trying period through which 
we have passed or of the conditions during and after that time— 
conditions which are still so unfavorable to art. 
But we stand or fall by results; in art as in so many serious 
matters there are no excuses. If we are to produce art worthy of 
our Southern States painters, poets, architects or sculptors to rank 
with our soldiers and statesmen; if we are to keep abreast of the 
good of our times, to do our share of the general accomplishment 
in the more favorably conditioned North and East; if we are even 
to attempt to do this, we will find our hands full to overflowing. 
As teacher and critic the artist’s relation to society is one of 
great importance. With a calling of such tremendous possibilities 
the pity is that many of our teachers and critics are comparatively 
untrained. If we wish medical knowledge, we go to a physician. 
So we would rather hear a great one on his work than all the 
 
-P-A-G-E-379
        JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 379 
amateurs in the world, no matter how gifted in their use of English. 
It is easy to teach vague, impossible theories and not even attempt 
to put into practice; so hard to teach sane, practical ones which 
may not rise to the skies, but which will most assuredly lift us 
out of the ditch. . 
We must remember that both teaching and criticism are rad- 
ically different operations to the actual production of a work of 
art. Unfortunately many gifted artists are incapable of express- 
ing themselves in such manner as to be valuable either to teacher 
or critic. Because of a feeling of paternal courtesy which prevents 
their criticising their fellow-workers (this is purely speculative 
theory, for I have never met such an artist), or because of great 
modesty (alas, how rare!), or through some fundamental acute- 
ness of expression the artist is frequently unable to teach efficiently 
or to wield the critical pen with the lash and gusto of the profes- 
sional writer. 
The practice of any art is so difficult, is so exacting, that he who 
divides his time between it and other fields of endeavor is apt to 
fall between the two stools. In a way, a sort of versatility has 
been the curse of many American painters. But that the true 
versatility which enables a man to do good work and to teach is not 
impossible, the names of most of our ablest painters prove. 
Conditions are not favorable to art. Michelangelo complained 
of the same thing. But often the artist takes a too pessimistic 
view of things—the troublesome grasshopper seems as heavy as a 
rhinoceros. Even Rodin, supreme genius that he is, writes recently 
that “Mankind believes itself able to do without art. It wishes to 
enjoy physically, to satisfy its bodily appetites. Mankind today 
is brutish; art is dead.” Partially true, this is unquestionably 
partially true, it has been and may be always, but few, I think, 
among us would endorse it entirely except in some mood of deep 
depression. 
There is a great gap between art and the people’s understanding 
of it. For the educated, art exists even less vitally than religion; 
for the great masses, it hardly lives at all. And I doubt if the 
people and the people’s necessities are better known to the artist 
than his works are to them. Until they so know one another— 
not better, for that means almost nothing, but well—the function 
of the artist in society is a vain and barren one; his work is a play- 
thing, and what should be a mighty power to stir men’s hearts to an 
abiding for the things that endure for the glorious meaning of life 
is merely a passing whim to be gratified at times and then for-

  gotten. So long as this is so, so long as the artist fulfills a per- 
verted function, one merely ornamental instead of vitally useful, 
just so long the relation of the artist to society will be a false and 
silly one. If art is to really live, it must begin in the heart of the 
artist; it must burn there; it must evince itself in all its work. 
It will not be art for art’s sake, or art for the high financial price; 
it will be a living, vital message; it will reach the hearts of all who 
‘are worthy of it. 
So, to sum it all up, the function of the artist in society must be 
that of a worker, and not that of a windy, humbug-giving theorist. 
That he who gives most receives most is a heartening principle to 
work on. He must give himself unselfishly—all his thoughts and 
energy and whatever of feeling and inspiration he may have. Then 
whether he paints or carves or preaches or teaches, he will be 
rewarder at least by a sense of work well done; and although most 
things die eventually, most ideals are shifted, most beliefs questioned 
and altered to a close relationship with revealed truth, his work 
will endure so long as men need its healing touch and feel its quick- 
ening influence. 
Tue Prepacocic Basis or Dusien. 
WM. H. VARNUM, MADISON, wISs. 
As students of art and education you are doubtless familiar 
with the discussion in reference to the subject of vocational train- 
ing. At a recent meeting of the Manual Arts Association of a 
neighboring state it was the keynote of the occasion, but no men- 
tion was made of design that must permeate vocational training to 
make it a success—permeate it from Genesis to Revelation. Design 
is the keystone in the majority of the arts, in sympathetic relation 
to the humanities, and is, moreover, a subject readily assimilated 
by the average student to his benefit. By the average student, I 
refer to one not among the artistically elect, or possessed of an 
artistic nature by right of a fortuitous inheritance, but rather to 
one who is able to discriminate between good and bad taste. 
In the presentation of this paper the speaker feels that a new 
synthetic presentation of the question of design is necessary in 
order to allow the subject—lacking the recognized place accorded 
the science and arts—to assume its proper place in the educational 
schedule of the modern school. To accomplish this, a brief outline 
of design as an educational process will possibly cover the topic in 
the most satisfactory manner.

        JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 381 
THE BASIS OF DESIGN. 
No subject has more abundant material at its command than the 
art of design. There are three sources of supply open to the 
designer that are endless reservoirs of motives and principles. 
1. Nature; the reference room of the designer, with her num- 
berless motives in plant, animal and human life. 
2. Geometric forms; the conjugations and arrangements of 
interlacing lines and planes, seen, in their ideal conceptions, in the 
Moorish school. 
3. Historic ornament; that traditional embodiment of man’s 
intellectual and emotional nature; an ornament that has withstood 
the test of centuries, and, in consequence, as a part of man’s 
environment has the most important bearing upon his ideals. 
AFFILIATED COURSES. 
It is readily seen that through these sources of information the 
student should have an associated knowledge of nature study, 
botany, biology, zodlogy, geometry, ancient and modern history, 
architecture and archeology. With the application of design to 
the crafts endless affiliated courses are discovered. Through the 
medium of design, then, these associated courses are to be fused 
into a practical service in the utilitarian and esthetic service of 
men. If the athletic field is a good mixer for various types of 
student individuality, design is an equally good assimilating 
medium for the courses to which reference has just been made. 
THD PERSONAL ATTITUDE IN DESIGN, 
Science is impersonal in its relation to student life. The 
humanics, those studies bearing upon the human note as illustrated 
by the literary studies, music and the graphic arts, exalt the per- 
sonal point of view. Design is a constant interrogation point 
toward this personal attitude. “Is this correct?” “Do you like 
this?” “This is not pleasing to me,” are stock questions. A large 
proportion of the articles one buys have personal meanings; they 
are true interpreters of ourselves and do not hesitate to speak their 
opinion. They enter into the home life and tinge its very atmos- 
phere. Their attitude toward the home brings out the importance 
of the subject of design in controlling the personality of our dwell- 
ings, for houses have personalities as well as the individuals inhab- 
iting them, and this personality is as readable to the designer as 
the printed page. It betrays us in our dress and in our homes 
and is an accurate thermometer of the esthetic temperament.
-P-A-G-E-382
   
       SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION.     382 
THE NATIONAL ATTITUDE IN DESIGN. 
The value of a problem is in the thought it frames, the princi- 
ples it defines, the true stimulus it furnishes. Our national char- 
acteristics and life keep us on the brink of over-stimulation most of 
the time. We are keyed to a high tension, and, as the case of 
highly organized beings, we become blasé and cannot normally 
respond to all stimuli. As a people we have a tendency to respond 
to false ideals, particularly when in the form of coin of the realm. 
We are the champion coin collectors of the world and readily 
respond to the call of commercial activity. | We respond to nature 
—in a way we like the country; a few for its artistry, but the bulk 
of us like it for its brooks. They are fine places in which to fish. 
The people will respond to a battle picture or a painting of a 
surgical operation, but will pass Whistler’s art with a mere quiz- 
zical glance. We respond to colors, and on fine Sundays we paint 
our back fence salmon and pink. We like to eat candy, play ball 
and go to the theater. We buy a cigarette-smoking cat or a tapes- 
try with an embroidered parrot. I say “we” in the sense of ninety 
per cent of the population. 
What does all this indicate? Merely that the utilitarian prob- 
lem has been unduly emphasized at the expense of the esthetic 
sense. Our merchants are easily won by mechanical beauty. Lack 
of beauty kills the demand with the better class of potential cus- 
tomers. Poor teachers and the lack of knowledge of true design 
covers our lamps with four-leafed clovers and tinsmith’s delight. 
It is, however, just beginning to be proved that the manufacturer 
who secures the better class of trade has paid attention to the line, 
form and decoration of his goods as he has to to the utility and hon- 
esty of his product. 
Why does the American shoe manufacturer sell his shoes so read- 
ily abroad? Have you ever looked the German-made shoe firmly 
in the foot? It is as honest as the sky, but flat and ugly and com- 
pletely lacking in any attention to the beauty line. The trim and 
neat American shoe appeals at a glance and finds little competition 
even in Paris. On the other hand, we send textiles to France to be 
returned to us doubled in value by the addition of designs printed 
on them. This contrast is an indication of what we can do when 
we try, and of our marked delinquency in the matter of design, and 
goes to prove that, as a nation, we are lacking in self-expression in 
the fine arts. American design has been the laughing-stock of 
Europe, and I am referring to design in its broadest sense. The 
proper stimuli will change all of this and bring in a new renais-
-P-A-G-E-383
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 383 
sance in American design. It is coming. Its ear marks are all 
around us in the wholesome revival of the arts and crafts move- 
ment. Carts and rafts it may degenerate into, but the stimulus 
is in it, and the teacher and the schools represent the true starting 
point of this much desired reformation. 
The true missionary, then, is the teacher fitted for the task of 
stimulating the sense of beauty. He must be capable of bringing 
out the glories of mass, line, color and tone; he must be deeply in 
love with the world, impressed with the beauty that surrounds us 
and never happier than when searching it out for himself and reveal- 
ing it to others. This may sound like a high ideal, but the 
designer is an idealist of the highest type and demands a standard 
of this nature: 
DESIGN AS A FULLY EDUCATIVE PROCESS. 
The general purpose of education must be kept constantly in 
mind, as there are certain fascinations in the arts of design, tend- 
ing to draw one into fads and fallacies. It is basketry one year, 
bisketry another year, thin bent iron or untimely death; with 
much thought and accent on the technical processes and with little 
thought as to practicability as an educative material. These have 
brought art into ill repute as a snap course—not so much, however, 
in the method of treating the medium as in the way of handling. 
In many institutions these processes are now being established on 
a sane basis and are becoming, in part, good educative processes. 
A complete chemical equation consists of the elements, the chem- 
ical action and the product. I realize the fact that this parallel 
is a dead one as compared to an educative process, but it can be 
said to be in a way similar. Hence, if the design problem and the 
student be brought into contact in the proper way, the action takes 
place in the mind of the student; the problem becomes charged with 
his intellectual and emotional nature—his personality. The com- 
pleted product is the result of this reaction; in other words, a com- 
plete mental reaction has been accomplished. 
Let us amplify this statement. When the golf player drives the 
ball from the teeing ground, he is supposed to “follow through” 
after the ball with his driver, to give it a final push and utilize all 
possible force in the stroke. In using the term “complete mental 
reaction,” I wish to infer that when a problem and a student are 
brought into contact, when this personality has been brought into 
play, he should be encouraged to “follow through,” to imbue the 
problem with himself and so crystallize it into this complete mental 
 
-P-A-G-E-384
  884 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
reaction. If I see a man beating a horse, and steel myself and pass 
by, against my will, the equation is not complete; if, however, I go 
to the man and endeavor to stop his cruelty by every means in my 
power, the equation is complete, independent of the outcome of my 
efforts to protect the horse. 
All design is, then, primarily, the projection or precipitation in 
material form of man’s intellectual and emotional nature. Design 
directed to and carried out is some concrete form on the applied 
or decorative arts is the highest form of efficiency in this com- 
pleted iquation. It is the sublimation of this mental process, 
idealistic in character, and, hence, one of the finest examples possi- 
ble for a full and complete mental creative and evolutionary process. 
THE IMAGINATIVE IMPULSE, 
Imagination is one inspiration of all art products and one of the 
most valuable assets in the study of design. Comparison is the 
first result of the exercise of the imagination. There exists a faint, 
dim image in the mind, an image of some almost unreal object of 
the past. This image is probably deeply buried in the subcon- 
sciousness. It is the teacher’s duty to form fresh images in the 
student’s mind by illustrations and by suggestions. The student 
then takes these fresh concepts to that dim image of the past as to 
a consulting lawyer; the mental state is one of comparison. The 
two images are compared and assimilated until they coincide and 
form one image, true and real, the result of his creation—his person- 
ality. 
This is the process of constructive imagination. When this 
welding process is complete, the student feels a sense of elation, a 
feeling of satisfaction over the region of the known increased by 
his conception, and the region of the unknown diminished. It is 
needless to say that, through lack of proper cultivation, imagina- 
tion is hardest to arouse. Originality seems to be almost dormant, 
but, when once aroused, we feel the thrill of satisfaction in seeing 
the product of the imagination gradually assuming form and con- 
gealing into a perfect whole. 
STRENGTHENING JUDGMENT. 
A comparison was suggested as one of the direct evidences of 
the development of imagination; a balancing of facts and what the 
designer thinks about them. This must result in the strengthen- 
ing of the weak or timid judgment. It raises the question of what 
is right and what is wrong. Here are two neckties; one is in as- 
 
-P-A-G-E-385
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 3885 
sumed good taste; the other, atrocious. The majority of us can 
decide as to the choice with a certain degree of precision. Now, if 
I add to the collection a third tie, the selection becomes more dif- 
ficult, and many other elements enter into the selection; the per- 
sonal equation, or the personal likes and dislikes of the wearer, 
and the knowledge he has of color harmonies and the other per- 
tinent laws of design. A certain decision is arrived at and the 
educative process completes itself. 
Did you ever listen to the illogical remarks of a woman upon the 
point of buying a ten-cent article for her home, or of a man pur- 
chasing a present for the fair sex? Inane reasoning follows asinine 
remarks: “I really can’t decide today.” “Yes, I like it, it is really 
very pretty, but I hardly know what I like.” “I don’t know much 
about art, but I know what I like,” until the clerk, in disgust, 
closes the case and no appeal is taken. These people all mean well, 
but they are hopelessly lost in the sea of doubt, with no pilot in 
sight, and no familiar landmarks in the shape of solid principles 
upon which to rely. The placing of the principles of design in 
the school curriculum ought to be advocated on the ground of 
common humane feeling for the salesmen, if for no other reason. 
ORDERLY THINKING IN DESIGN, 
Both constructive and decorative design problems should have 
an underlying basis of logical and orderly thinking to help in the 
development of a sort of scientific-artist spirit, one of qualities 
of a successful designer. To design is to give tangible thought 
and definition of expression to an idea. The term “to design” 
signifies an interesting, and possibly a beautiful, but at least an 
orderly, rendering of this expression. 
As the imaginative impulse has a fundamental process, the ex- 
ercise of the process of comparison, so the successful teacher, in 
the selection of motive for cultural or applied purposes, must, of 
necessity, select a plant or other motif that has some connection 
with a previous concept and that is adaptable to previously taught 
progressive principles of conventionalization. Much of the bad 
pedagogy in the teaching of design lies in the fact that the anal- 
ogous connection with the same previous image in the brain, simi- 
lar in character, has never been considered, or, at least, has been 
badly connected. The palpable absurdity of the supervisor’s re- 
quest for a decorative sketch of the ocean, when the majority of 
the class had never seen so much as. a pond of water, is evident. 
There should be some mental image as a basis of comparison.

Certain teachers will call for the conventionalization of a nas- 
turtium, when a similar form has never been considered, nor any 
logical steps given for the consideration of this particular type of 
form. There seems to be a feeling that if the magic word “conven- 
tionalization” is waved in the air, its mystic influence is sure to 
start a flow of inspiring design units. But how often the word 
fails and the frowns and scowls of the children indicate an incom- 
plete reaction, and all for the lack of a basis of comparison, or, let 
us put it frankly—bad pedagogy. 
Along this same line of incomplete or broken reactions, can be 
classed the tile that is never fired or, at least, only slightly warmed 
into a state of innocuous desuetude, with its consequent lack of 
utility, meaningless and unapplied ornament when an application 
is readily to be found; manual training exercises, dead and dry, 
with no warm, live, personal or community interests, and so on 
through a vast number that encumber our educational system. 
To resume, a motive for any project of considerable importance 
should be selected with some personal or community interest that 
will raise some previous image as a basis of comparison; in other 
words, that is not so radical in form that the continuity with the 
preceding problem is broken. Care should be taken to keep the 
motive live and vital, and not so old and stale that it no longer 
affords fresh personal stimulus. Corn is eminently fitted for Cen- 
tral Illinois. It is a local stimulus to industry, and can become 
a true pedagogic selection, providing its lines of growth make it 
adaptable to its intended application. 
This is cited merely as an example of the logical reasoning pre- 
ceding the choice of a motive or project. It should be the result of 
careful selection. Presumably there is something in this final se- 
lection that has appealed to the subconsciousness of him who makes 
the choice; that has aroused in him a desire to use this particular 
object. It is difficult to determine always just what this is. It 
may be a particular curve of a leaf, an attractive color, or its gen- 
eral adaptivity. He himself, possibly, could not tell you exactly. 
The choice, by the process of logical thinking governed by the laws 
of design, will develop an orderly motive tinged with his personality 
and, hence, a good example of a partially completed equation. 
SELECTION OF MATERIAL, 
Preceding a wise selection of the motives, comes the choice of 
materials in reference to service and enrichment. Let me reiterate 
the fact that the completed equation has not been reached until a 
 
-P-A-G-E-387
    
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 887 
full and complete expression in action, a precipitation of the stu- 
dent’s ideas in material form has been attempted. As this is the 
crystallization of the mental process, the materials of expression 
should be of sufficient dignity and permanence to retain that con- 
erete fact. 
The material for the development of the design must be in ac- 
cord with the student’s technical training at the time. It must 
be sufficiently responsive to his wishes to leave him unhampered 
in the manual operations. I saw some children struggling with 
large reeds; they were trying to force them into the desired form 
when, without a doubt, it would have required the energy of a 
strong man to swing the three-eights-inch reed into place. I have 
suggested a list of materials, arranged in order of ease of manip- 
ulation and in their suitability as educational materials. 
(1) Clay and cement, leather; (2) wood: (3) copper and brass, 
glass; (4) silver; (5) gold. 
They are all capable of a high degree of beauty of texture and 
decoration, have a gradually increasing commercial value scale as 
crude products, and as finished productions are capable of un- 
limited service and, one and all, are directly useful in the activi- 
ties of life. To the ennuyed society student the plunge into clay, 
the clean dirt of it all, the laying aside of diamonds and the powder 
puff, marks clay as a good leveler and a most excellent medium 
with which to introduce the craftsman spirit. 
The clean smell of the wood is invigorating, reminiscent of hon- 
est toil and the forests; copper and brass are refractory, but posses 
unlimited possibilities when correctly manipulated with technical 
skill. The economic efficiency necessary to the designing of articles 
in gold and silver, the respect inspired for the materials, mark a 
good terminating medium of expression for the course and form 
means of interpreting some of the finest products of man’s brain. 
SPECIFIC ILLUSTRATION OF DESIGN AS AN EDUCATIVE PROCESS. 
A specific example of the mental processes involved in the for- 
mation of a design will suggest the means I would use in present- 
ing the subject to a class. A cement garden urn is to be designed. 
I like this illustration, because it represents a solid, durable and 
serviceable object, capable of most interesting enrichment. It is a 
good cathode for the deposit of the personality anode from the 
student mind. The urn has past history; it is associated with na- 
ture, and its location in a formal garden is full of possibilities. 
We ought to consider this form of applied art and its motivation 
 
-P-A-G-E-388
  888 SOUTHERN HDUOATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
as an inspiration and a stimulus in itself. The legitimate aim of 
design is to give pleasure through beauty, and to beautify service 
and utility. This is a strong plea for the justification of applied 
and pure design, and gives the key to the selection of the prob- 
lems to be placed in a course. 
The cement urn must be designed in the light of the student’s 
technical and theoretical knowledge of the laws of pure and con- 
structive design. After consultation with what has been accom- 
plished in historic ornament, to the question of vases and their 
proportions, he finds that the construction of the urn calls for a 
knowledge of cement and its use in the arts. Here we find con- 
trasted two distinct processes; the first, designing, an evolutionary 
process of the highest form; the second, cement construction, non- 
evolutionary in character and of a scientific nature. These, it will 
be seen, are two strong forces that touch a great many of his in- 
terests and supplement each other. He finds that with each stroke 
of the pencil his imaginative powers are aroused and his person- 
ality begins to express itself. The contour and the other con- 
structive features begin to express an echo of an ideal form in his 
brain. As in a purely mechanical process, there is no attempt made 
or no incentive to stop at merely scientific facts. 
When the form of the urn is completed, or the constructive por- 
tions finished, he feels the need, as old as primitive man, to intro- 
duce some form of ornamentation suitable to the enrichment of 
the urn. Again his educational equipment is called into play. 
What form of growth is suitable, what plant or animal will be 
most appropriate to the urn. He possibly begins to feel his lack 
of concepts, and this want can be used as a potent force to connect 
his design course with some of the suggested correlated studies. 
Many students presumably looking for a “snap course” will enter 
the design and crafts class, become interested in the work, and, 
through the limitations of their knowledge of the equipment of 
the designer, are stimulated to the point of entering upon a broad 
course of study, and eventually graduate with the arts or other 
equivalent degree. 
Orderly thinking next suggests a rendering in the form of a pen- 
cil drawing on tinted paper, with accents in white and black to 
indicate relief. This is to be the most careful analysis the student 
is capable of making, with the view of becoming acquainted with 
the kernels, ear, stalk, leaf and flower; storing the mind with 
graphic material to be used in a subsequent process. If the hand 
can be so trained as to produce from memory an excellent graphic
-P-A-G-E-389
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 389 
drawing of the corn, it will leave the mind free to move along the 
lines of imaginative design, unhampered by a lack of graphic lan- 
guage with which to express its ideas. To attempt designing with- 
out having acquired this facility would be equivalent to writing a 
theme without a knowledge of the necessary vocabulary. 
A manual arts student is generally found to be lacking in tech- 
nical skill in freehand drawing, in supleness of the fingers and 
wrist necessary to swing in the long tangential curves of an easy- 
flowing design from nature. Various devices have been tried to 
overcome this difficulty in the quickest manner. Pencil drawings 
from historic ornament of the Greek and renaissance schools are 
helpful processes. 
Then, again, the motor activities refuse to respond to the brain’s 
demand for a particularly subtle curve, or the designer’s skill is 
insufficient to represent a curved surface with appropriate shading. 
Plastelene is an excellent medium in both of these cases. The hand 
seems to travel more freely through the plastic medium than across 
paper. As the designer’s skill develops, tinted paper, with a sug- 
gestion of light and shade in opaque water-colors, should be almost 
exclusively used. This is the professional designer’s medium of 
expression, and should be arrived at in the shortest possible time. . 
The motive for its analytical rendering accomplished, a second 
step calls for the adaptation of the motif to the surface of the urn. 
This is a synthetic process, and the student’s knowledge of the laws 
of design is called into full play to govern and control by logical 
and orderly ideas the product of his imaginative genius. As the 
processes of adaptation continue, he sees his creation in its entirety 
arriving nearer and nearer to his ultimate aim, the truth of his 
mental conception. He becomes a self-constituted judge, with a 
sense of pride in the outcome of his conception, and with a personal 
interest in it. He has a true art product, with all of the cultural 
and educative value of the same, proved by the fact that art is the 
product of the thing, the concept, plus what he has thought about 
it, what the creative genius of his artistic ability has infused into 
it. True, this often may fall far below his anticipations, but the 
failure causes a feeling of discontent and a desire to improve. 
Every design teacher has experienced satisfaction when a student 
voluntarily requests to repeat a certain problem in outside hours, 
without the flunking sign being suspended over his head. It is not 
the result, but rather the mental effort, that is valuable to him; 
mental efforts of evolutionary character so valuable to the peda- 
gogy of youth. This comparison is the truly educative part of the
-P-A-G-E-390
  390 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
process, and the result of the “carry through” will be the embodi- 
ment of his personality in the concrete form of an interesting, and 
it is to be hoped, beautiful conventionalized design, ready to be 
applied to the urn. This type of project signifies the completed 
equation in applied design, and is a full exemplification of the art 
as an educative process. 
CONVENIENT RESTING POINTS. 
I hardly feel justified in closing without some reference to con- 
venient resting places in the teaching of design, a bit of a shelf 
where the student may rest with a snug feeling of content in the 
apparent result obtained, often far short of its legitimate end. The 
average Sunday crowd in the Art Museum will illustrate one stop- 
ping place. The people pass by the pictures with wide open but 
unseeing eyes, a sort of “you check the catalogue and I will look” 
attitude, but with much complacency and sincerity. They are see- 
ing the gallery. Students with a slight knowledge of design often 
“look” through a gallery with the mind closed to any impression 
of beauty. As far as the value of this process is concerned, one is 
reminded of the farmer who saw the Samothracian Victory for the 
first time. He read the museum sign: ‘Hands off.” With a sympa- 
thetic grunt he surveyed the Victory, and murmured, “Yes, indeed, 
poor thing, and head, too.” Copying a design with no vitalizing 
effort on the student’s part is an indication of this resting stage. 
The second resting shelf may be at the stopping place of most 
of us—mere appreciation of design. Most of the superficially pre- 
pared art students stop here. They can effervesce most interest- 
ingly over a bit of craftsmanship. It is an ebullition indicative of 
a certain amount of action, but merely an indication. This indi- 
vidual sees a sunset; he is impressed with its beauty, by its inspir- 
ing majesty, by its suggestion of omnipotence, but he rests there, 
exhausting the subject. Through the arts of design he should be 
so responsive to the stimulus of the sunset that he is able to assimi- 
late it, and add it to his motives, so that, when the moment arrives 
he can recall and use its possibilities in the designs at hand. 
The alert student is so intensely responsive that he sees designs 
in the most novel materials. The Japanese use many motives that 
are lost to us. Their idealization of flames, sea waves, flying foam, 
fog and rain, marks them as a most observant and receptive race, 
open to all possible impressions, and with a “carry through” of the 
completely equipped designer. 
The third shelf is the intellectual enjoyment of design. Our 
friends in the department of ancient language are apt to adopt
-P-A-G-E-391
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 891 
this attitude towards the art of sculpture, to the detriment of their 
appreciation of painting. The emotional motive in a certain de- 
sign embodying the life activities of a people, the emotional play 
of colors in a Persian rug, become subjects for the most scientific 
analysis, and the true esthetic beauty of the design is lost in the 
pursuit of a cloud of scientific facts. 
I do not want to be considered as overlooking the importance of 
these steps of observation and appreciation, both intellectual and 
esthetic. They are of the utmost merit, but in the educative pro- 
cess they are to be considered as merely educative steps in the stu- 
dent’s progress. One of the reasons for the difficulty of the pro- 
cess of original thinking and the full play of the imagination, rests 
in the fact that there is no background of facts, no fine filagree 
network of imagery with which the imaginative impulse may be- 
come entangled. Theoretically, these facts are in the subcon- 
sciousness, but they are in the sub-subcellar of the mind, and the 
stimulus of ideal beauty of design has been away so long that the 
keys have disappeared and the locks are rusty with misuse. 
In closing, let me say that the teacher must strive to find this 
stimulus, and, in the meantime, create a spirit of healthy discon- 
tent at stopping anywhere short of a complete reaction, and that 
is in 
ACTION AND SELF-EXPRESSION. 
Here, then, is the legitimate end of the educative process and 
the true cause for problem motivation. The stimulus for this must, 
of necessity, rest on the shoulders of the design instructor. He 
should have definite ideals and a fine, broad conception of the 
course, an apprecation of the best in design and in the applied 
arts, habits of diligence to tide over the stopping places on the 
road to a complete reaction, an ability to stimulate the imagination 
and, above all, a feeling of responsibility that rests upon him as a 
teacher of design. 
Roughly speaking, science has to do with the investigation tending 
toward knowledge, both of which we associate with the conscious 
mind. The art of design has to do with the imagination, tending 
towards ideality, both of which necessitate action of the subcon- 
scious mind, one of the highest possible forms of an educative pro- 
cess. Are we not, then, fully justified in the belief that design, cor- 
rectly taught, is one of the most important factors, one of the 
most pressing needs in the modern school curriculum, and that it is 
a sure means of educating the people to a point of full and inde- 
pendent self-activity—the pressing need of our country.

A Suaeestive Ouriine or a Course ror TRAINING TEACHERS 
In THE Use or Books. 
MISS LUCY FAY, UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
In spite of frequent discussions, innumerable round-tables and 
much printed matter on this subject, your program committee has 
asked me to go over the ground again, and suggest an outline of a 
course in library methods for normal schools. In view of the fact 
that so few as six of our Southern states are offering this instruc- 
tion in their normal schools, it would seem more to the point to 
discuss briefly the need of this work, the conditions necessary for
-P-A-G-E-393
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 393 
giving such instruction, and, finally, suggest an outline for such 
a course. 
The chief reasons for introducing required courses in library 
methods in normal schools, I say required purposely, for elective 
courses will not bring the desired results, are mainly two: First, 
to train teachers themselves in the use of books, and in order that 
they may teach their pupils how to use books; and, secondly, to ac- 
quaint teachers with enough library technique to enable them to ad- 
minister a school library efficiently when called upon to do so. The 
necessity of these two phases of the work must be apparent to every 
one, and this very need indicates the form the instruction should 
take. The last few years have brought about such a change in the 
methods of teaching that even in the lower grades children are re- 
quired to do collateral reading; to get away from a slavish follow- 
ing of the text-book; to search encyclopedias and historical refer- 
ence books. To use, in this day of the manual arts, an accustomed 
figure of speech—children must do more than drive in with the 
hammer; they must learn to handle a plane, a saw, a chisel. Who 
is going to teach them how to use these sharper tools? It is an 
acknowledged fact, not simply by librarians who have suffered ob- 
jectively, but by teachers who have toiled and broiled in their ef- 
forts to use reference books readily, that as a rule teachers are not 
acquainted with general reference books as they should be, nor do 
they know thoroughly the literature of the subjects they are teach- 
ing. The waste of time in the mere physical use of books is ap- 
palling. 
The change in the teaching method, moreover, has brought about 
the necessity for larger and better school libraries, and the last five 
years has seen a remarkable development of school libraries all over 
the South. Almost every Southern state now has a school library 
law, and libraries have been placed in thousands of schools. What 
at present is the working conditions of most of these libraries? It 
is not very satisfactory. First, the books in these libraries have 
not been selected with the care and discretion that should have 
been exercised. Schools receiving state money are compelled to 
select their library books from the state lists. These lists are made 
up in various ways, but it is apparent that the selection has been 
largely based on cheapness of edition, publications of certain edu- 
cational publishing houses, and contracts that could be made with 
various school supply houses. Those school libraries that have not 
been bought with state money are often composed of the donations 
of well-meaning citizens who, from time to time, outgrew the attic
-P-A-G-E-394

space in their houses, and having a generous feeling toward the 
civic development of the community, unload the accumulations of 
years on the defenceless library of their high school. 
An unattractive book resembling a text-book, put in the hands of 
a child is a certain means of deadening whatever latent interest 
that boy or girl may possess. Few books, better selected and in 
attractive, illustrated editions where possible, will make our school 
libraries vital. The purpose of making children eager readers of 
good books will then be accomplished. 
In addition to a careful selection of the books, these libraries 
need to be administered capably, and that will be an impossibility 
unless the teacher in charge knows at least the elements of library 
method. Not necessarily the intricacies of cataloguing and classi- 
fication, but a working knowledge of reference books; how to use 
encyclopedias and dictionaries; how to teach a child to use an 
index and table of contents; and, if the library is catalogued, to 
use the catalogue intelligently. There is a high school library I 
know of, numbering 2,000 volumes or more. The school board paid 
a trained librarian to classify and catalogue this library and to 
install a charging system. When that work was done, a girl was 
appointed to sit in the library and issue books. The teachers in 
this school seemingly offer no help to the pupils; of course, the 
girl who sits at the loan desk doesn’t know how, for the students 
are compelled to go to another part of the city—to either the public 
or the college library—and ask the reference librarian to find for 
them the material in any encyclopedia which is right in their own 
library. Instances of this kind occur again and again, and such 
conditions indicate that school libraries are so much dead mate- 
rial, if the pupils and teachers make no better use of them. An- 
other example will show, I believe, what need there is for teachers 
to be trained in the selection of children’s books. A small friend 
of mine came to me the other day in much perplexity. The seventh 
grade pupils had been required to read any five books from a list 
of authors given them by their teacher. The list was as follows: 
Jane Austen, Dickens, Scott, Thakeray, Charlotte Bronte, George 
Elliot, Cooper and Mark Twain. The child knew not what to 
choose, and, unguided, would have been as likely to read Adam Bede 
as she would have the Last of the Mohicans. By what instinct 
would this small girl have known that Ivanhoe was a book that 
would interest her, while The Heart of Midlothian, Pride and Preju- 
dice, or Henry Esmond were beyond her reach and should wait a 
while?

  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 395 
That the need of giving teachers training in library methods is 
urgent, most of us will agree; but when we come to the practical 
question of putting this instruction in the normal school, we are 
face to face with conditions necessary for giving the work. Two 
things are needed to give this instruction: A library in the normal 
school large enough and well enough administered to afford the re- 
quired material to work with; and a librarian who can give the in- 
struction. Glance over the statistical tables in the last report of 
the Commissioner of Education, and look at the number of volumes 
in the libraries of the state normal schools of the South. The fig- 
ures are encouraging, and yet as far as I have been able to learn 
from inquiries sent some weeks ago, Kentucky, Virginia, West Vir- 
ginia, South Carolina, Oklahoma and one normal college in Texas 
are the only institutions giving actual courses in library methods. 
Of course, in the South we are conservative, and conditions in many 
schools have made it impossible to undertake this work heretofore, 
but the need is great and there should be no delay. A beginning 
can be made with a small but good collection of reference books, 
and in some states the Library Commission will supply traveling 
libraries for giving the courses in book selection. Where it is im- 
possible to employ a trained librarian to do the teaching, some 
arrangement might be made with the state organizer to visit the 
normal school for two or three weeks and direct the work. Where 
there is no state organizer, appeal might be made to whatever 
trained librarian is to be found in your state, and same agreement 
reached whereby that librarian could direct the work for a short 
course. These informal efforts are far better than no efforts, and 
until satisfactory working conditions are secured this means 
should be resorted to. 
Well-planned courses in library methods are being successfully 
given at many normal schools in the East and West, and outlines 
of these courses that have been tested should be consulted and fol- 
lowed in so far as they suit our local conditions. Last summer at 
the six weeks’ session of the Summer School of the South at the 
University of Tennessee, two courses of thirty hours each were 
given, and the results were, on the whole, satisfactory: Thirty-six 
hours might more profitably have been given to the work, and on 
a thirty-six hour basis this plan would easily work into the year’s 
schedule of the normal college. With our experiment a Knoxville 
as a basis, I would suggest the following outline as a feasible plan 
and one that could be adapted to the normal school curriculum:

There is but little history with which to handle this subject, even 
though it were desirable to do so historically in this brief paper. 
It is not necessary for me to say that there always has been a need 
and demand for some way to keep in proper form the sayings and 
writings of men and women of note. Even the oldest inhabitant, of 
whom we have any definite knowledge, is determined solely by the 
legacy left in some form of tabulation, whether it be stone, papyrus 
or the modernized method of the attractive de luxe edition of some 
famous classic.

It is a reasonable classification to divide all libraries under three 
distinct heads, viz.: that of national, municipal and state. The first 
we have little to do with in this paper. I will say, however, as a 
general proposition, that national libraries have to deal entirely 
with the distribution of government publications to libraries so 
designated and government depositories. 
The second, municipal legislation, stands in a very direct measure 
alone, in some states modified by existing state laws which grant 
certain privileges to municipalities. There is no very definite idea 
relative to laws which should be enacted to cover the formation, 
maintenance and care of such libraries under state control; state as 
well as local authorities are not averse to providing favorable work- 
ing conditions for any really progressive measure, if there could and 
would be adequate working control locally, even though permission 
is given under certain restrictions. Those in whose custody said 
libraries would be placed do not have a clear conception of how to 
care for the books under their control, and we find this true in 
supplies and equipment purchased by boards of education over the 
country. Objection is not usually made to the purchase of adequate 
equipment, if same would be properly cared for by those in authority. 
I believe such care could be exercised by proper restrictions and 
supervision. 
The earliest state library legislation is found in the state of South 
Carolina, in 1700, to protect and further establish parochial libraries, 
which were designated “for publicke use.” It was found that want 
of care and protection to those parochial libraries made it necessary 
for an act, passed in 1712, to say, “the unrestrained liberty hath 
already proved very prejudicial to said library, several of the books 
being lost and others damnified.” The ruthless want of care has 
been passed from our forefathers down to the present generation. 
It makes my heart burn at the want of care in handling property, 
whether private or public, and I want it clearly understood that 
I am of the opinion, from careful observation, that we are growing 
less careful. When that problem is made plain but few objections 
will be found in public life and places to the giving of public funds 
for the establishing of adequate library facilities in every state. 
Writers of library legislation have noted possibly five steps in 
this development. The first is shown by the incorporation of joint 
stock companies which had various titles, and from such legislation 
we have, as a modification, our modern traveling libraries; the splen- 
did progress of these libraries made it very plain to the establishers 
that a more generous use of the books should be found and many

were merged into the well known free libraries generously dotted 
over our land today. I can well remember when the $3.00 per annum 
library was a wonderful thing, and I was always eager for the 
opportunity to pay the per annum for such privilege. The commer- 
cial development of recent years has had much to do with popular- 
izing libraries. 
The second step in the library development is found in what is 
known as district libraries. These had their origin under existing 
state laws; most of these were inadequate because funds were not 
provided. A definite amount, though small, if annually given, would, 
in a measure, meet the objections of those who desire large amounts 
or none at all. Why should not our teachers and those in authority 
be able to cope with the supervision problem? If they are not able 
to control that situation, I am equally certain that they would not 
be able to control any other situation. My only answer to such 
argument is, let people have a full realization of their responsibil- 
ities and meet them. I have no faith in those who shirk any duty. 
The Cincinnati Public Library is an excellent, notable one under 
the second step of library development. 
The special tax levy marks the third step in this development for 
state and municipal aid. New Hampshire has the high honor of 
being; the first state to place upon its statute book a law for estab- 
lishing and maintaining free public libraries by local taxation. 
Forty-one states have followed New Hampshire’s lead in this legis- 
lation. It appears that this furnished a splendid basis for growth 
in library work, bringing this opportunity to cities and towns in 
nearly every state in the union. 
The fourth step might be classed as “premium legislation,” as seen 
in the state of Massachusetts, when, in 1890, she created a state com- 
mission to establish libraries and to inquire into their efficiency. 
The “premium” offered by this commission was as high as $100.00 
to any town desiring to establish a library. This is the first time 
in the history of library legislation where the state was willing to 
take the lead and responsibility for the establishing of libraries. 
The idea is a pleasant one and has met, in a measure, the needs 
of many people; it did things, and by the doing became popular; it 
created the local library sentiment very nicely—created in the main 
“ splendid feeling for that class of education. It has reached a very 
high state of development as found in the state of New York and 
has accomplished the following, as found from a recent report from 
that state: 
1. Creating traveling libraries. 
2. Creating instruction departments. 
 
-P-A-G-E-400
  400 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
3. Giving money or books upon local conditions as met by law. 
4. Distribution of public documents. 
5. An information bureau. 
6. Issuing bulletins from various departments. 
The fifth step has never been popular, that of mandatory establish- 
ing and maintenance of libraries. New Hampshire tried this in 
1895, the state aiding under certain conditions. This law was not 
found to have been popular in any of our states, as New Hampshire 
stands alone in this class of legislation. 
There is so much of interest in developing this subject that time 
at my command is inadequate to deal as I should like. 
Standing upon the proposition that adequate control and care 
can be secured for the smaller library unit if the state will grant the 
required aid by direct legislation, a law should be framed and passed 
in every state in the union where some of the following conditions 
will be met: 
-1. An appropriation from the public funds of the state per capita 
of census children, said amount to be paid out by the State Superin- 
tendent upon proper warrants. Said fund should be prorated to the 
several counties with other school funds of the state. 
2. A definite library board should be established from certain 
school officials in every county, with their duties clearly defined. 
3. A definite person to have control and custody of all books in 
each district under very stringent regulation, all books in such cus- 
tody and control to be annually accounted for definite location of 
said district library. 
4. How library. funds shall be handled. 
A law incorporating in detail the above items was worked out in 
this state and passed both houses at two different sessions of our 
state Legislature, but was not favorably considered by those in 
charge. 
I am certain that a workable law for the establishing of libraries 
in the smaller units of any state is perfectly feasible, and am sure 
we will see our desires fully met at no distant date.

laboratory in teaching the science courses. That is a large subject, 
and it will be well for me at once to limit it to a part of the field. 
Consequently, I shall speak to you as a teacher of history, and shall 
talk about the subject of history, and amend the title of my paper 
accordingly. If what I have to say is true of history, it is true of 
all the social sciences and will apply to government or civics and 
to economics as well. I think it will apply also to literature, but if 
any representative of that field tells us that I am wrong and that 
literature courses do not need library facilities as much as history 
and economics, I can only hope that some one of that fraternity will 
come to my assistance and at least make him prove his case. 
In recent years our Southern schools and colleges have made won- 
derful, cheering progress. Schools are continually coming into 
existence where before there were no schools. Schools which 
formerly carried on their work only a few weeks in each year are 
coming to have longer terms. Three-year high schools are giving 
place to four-year high schools. Colleges, some of them, are ceasing 
to compete with the schools for students, and are insisting that the 
student finish his school course before coming to college. Quan- 
titively we have about reached a goal, measured by the expectant 
freshman in the magic term of fourteen or fifteen. “units,” and by 
the high school student generally as “graduation” after the com- 
pletion of his course. Now, the questions before us are those of 
quality of work. Given a school, a full school year, and a full num- 
ber of years, there still remains the problem of making all this real: 
If we have poor equipment, poor teachers, and poor methods, our 
schools with all their periods and years of work will be passing a 
depreciated educational currency, which it is our duty to retire in 
favor of a sound money that is what it pretends to be. 
So our schools are bettering their equipment and their instruction 
and their methods. The log schoolhouse is giving way to the frame 
building, and that to the edifice of brick or stone. The preparation 
of teachers, too, it is sought to place on a basis of reality. Perhaps 
most advertised of all is the improvement in methods of teaching, 
at least there seems to be a most remarkable productivity in the 
writing of books about methods, and in the summer schools that I 
have known courses in method seem to be the most eagerly sought. 
But method must assume the teacher and the equipment, though this 
rule, as I know, is in practice often reversed. Let us consider this 
point a little more carefully. 
We have to come to see, first, that a school must have a building, 
and that it ought to have a good building. Speaking relatively, this 
26
-P-A-G-E-402
   
        402 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
demand seems not hard to meet. A big handsome building appeals 
to local pride. Our cities will issue enormous bond issues for their 
school buildings when once this local pride is aroused. So our best 
high schools and many elementary schools are housed in structures 
as to which the term palatial does not seem extravagant. But a 
fine building does not of itself make a good school. 
Secondly, there is what we may call the material equipment. The 
building must be well lighted and heated, and, too, ought to be kept 
clean. There ought to be enough blackboards; there should be ade- 
quate healthful seats. These, too, are relatively easy to secure, and 
from these we may pass to athletic fields, swimming pools and hot 
lunches. All make a show; all appeal to the common sense point 
of view of our municipal authorities. In smaller places the point of 
view is the same, though resources, of course, differ. 
When we pass to what we may call the intellectual equipment we 
have to think of teachers and the special implements or tools that 
they need. The preparation of the teacher is a matter that does not 
appeal to the school board as quickly as the fine building, but the 
indefatigable work of the school men gradually establishes better 
and better standards. Then there must be text-books, and of these, 
while there is still much to be improved, we must say that they, too, 
show in their advance over the text-books of a generation ago the 
results of tireless struggle for better things. 
Nowadays teachers demand more than text-books, and the teachers 
of the natural sciences are winning their part of the fight. In this 
age of science applied to the wants of man the need of laboratories 
does not have to be left to theoretical demonstration. The places 
where it is attempted to teach chemistry and physics purely with 
the aid of a text-book and without the actual participation of the 
student in laboratory work are few in number and will soon be only 
a matter of interest to the analyst of educational methods. Even in 
the lower schools, where instruction in the sciences as such is not 
attempted, the vocational side of education in the city schools and 
the agricultural instruction in the country schools make the strong- 
est kind of appeal for support. 
Now the teachers of the subjects other than natural sciences re- 
main to be provided for, and, as I said before, I shall select for 
illustration the subject with which I am most familiar. History 
teaching, too, has been sharing in the general educational advance 
of recent years. Part of the discussion of the needs of better 
methods has come with reference to preparation for college, but the 
greater inspiration to the elevation of standards lies in the concern
-P-A-G-E-403
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 403 
for the number of boys and girls who grow up to be citizens with 
no further training than that of the school. 
There used to be some school where a history class consisted of a 
teacher, scholars and a text-book. The teacher had no special wish 
to teach history. It fell to her lot because in the general distribu- 
tion of work it had turned out that she had a little less to do than 
the other teachers, so she was given the history. There was no 
question whether she was prepared to teach history; there was the 
book—she could read English. So the teacher would keep a day or 
so ahead of the class to avoid embarrassing questions, and the stu- 
dents would “recite” what they had “learned” from the book. Mem- 
ory; or rather memorizing, was the chief intellectual discipline ob- 
tained. The kind of interrogation by which this exercise was con- 
ducted has been well satirized in the supposed question, “Who went 
where, with how many men?” 
The text-books of this former day loaned themselves to this kind 
of teaching. In deference to an inherited tradition, the chief events 
of interest to mankind were supposed to be those in which mankind 
had tried to eliminate itself, hence the prominence given to wars— 
to what John Richard Green calls “drum and trumpet” history. 
In a well-known work, quoted by Professor Bourne in his excellent 
“Teaching of History and Civics,” we are edified with the following 
information: “The struggle was continued in 528 and 524 with 
little success. But in 5382 the war was begun again and ended in 
534 with the extinction of the Burgundian kingdom.” What joy for 
the memorizer! 
Text-books of history have got away from this evil; with history 
is now a less dreary narrative of battles and treaties. History is 
seen to be more the past politics, and politics in the past we know 
to have been closely interrelated with economic questions, compar- 
able to our own. So the modern text-book is more human in that it 
touches the realities of life at so many more points than in the older 
days. But in the effort to be encyclopaedic the text-book of today 
sometimes falls into another error—that of trying to do the student’s 
thinking for him. Some of these books present to the student not 
the arid facts, indeed, of the older text-books, but alluring generali- 
zations, illustrations of “causes and effects.” So greatly does this 
characterize one well known series of histories that a wag has in- 
vented the phrase “mysterized history,” and there has been a draw- 
ing away from books of this kind for the immature reader, for if such 
judgments are learned by rote they go to make up only a better 
kind of memorization, and one can imagine a healthy boy or girl
-P-A-G-E-404
404 SOUTHERN BDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
becoming as thoroughly tired of causes and effects thus learned as 
of lists of dates. 
So up-to-date history teaching, while fully recognizing the need of 
the text-book to give continuity and connection to the work, rejects 
the procedure by text-books alone and demands that the teacher of 
history be provided with a laboratory, and that the students do 
“laboratory work.” This will not be exactly the same kind of work 
as that of the chemical laboratory, either for the teacher or the 
student, for each has methods of its own, but the demand for some- 
thing else than the text-book will be common to both. 
I shall not here elaborate the needs of the teacher in the class- 
room—the desirability of historical maps in cases of collections of 
photographs or other pictures for historical study; of the note- 
worthy development made in recent years in the making of models 
of objects that illustrate history; of the utility of the stereopticon 
and the refiectoscope—but shall speak of a greater and simpler want, 
that of books. The historical laboratory that we want first is the 
library, and the independent work that the student is to do is his 
reference and collateral reading. 
It is not my intention here to enter into a discussion of the exact 
position of history in the realm of thought. We shall leave to others 
to determine whether history is or is not a science or whether it 
is merely a form of literature. Let us assume that it has a method 
of its own, and that it has an educational value of its own, or else 
let us call it by some other name or leave it out. One writer has 
said, “the study of history should be essentially a study of logic 
which is written in concrete facts. The problem which confronts 
the teacher is to discover the practical methods by which the facts of 
history may be used as raw material for classification according to 
the laws of thought.” On this sententious dictum Professor Bourne 
wisely comments: “If this is true, the name history on the school 
curriculum should at once give way to logic in order that the pupils 
should not be under a misapprehension as to what they are study- 
ing.” (Bourne, The Teaching of History and Civics, p. 164, n.) 
So the ethical relations of history are often strongly stressed. If 
history only is a branch of ethics let us frankly classify it under that 
head. A whitewashed history that leaves out the dark spots, a jingo 
history which teaches that what our country does is always right, 
for these the historian has little respect. When it teaches the truth 
history has, of course, a high ethical value, as does any form of 
truth, and the implanting of the love of truth ought to be one of 
the highest results of history properly taught. History tells how
-P-A-G-E-405
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 405 
the world we live in came to be, not the material world only, but 
the intellectual and horal and economic and political world—in fine, 
the whole world. It ought to teach us what we ourselves are as chil- 
dren of the past; what it really means to be an American or an 
Englishman, a thirteenth century man or a twentieth century man. 
It trains the imagination within the limits of truth, and the judg- 
ment outside of the limits of the syllogism. 
The one great difference between the approach to history on the 
one hand and that to science on the other lies in the fact that the 
facts of history come to us for the most part through intermediate 
materials, and not directly, as in the observed facts of science. We 
cannot repeat the experiment of the French Revolution or vary the 
phenomena of the execution of Charles the First. Through the labor 
of many writers the knowledge of the past somehow gets into a 
modern book. To the child of one text-book that book is history. 
Certain facts are stated and certain conclusions drawn. If this work 
is well done the text-book gives the child certain information, and 
this is a valuable service. But when with discrimination and due 
pedagogic reward to the stage of progress of the student there is 
held up constantly the aim of acquiring further knowledge when it 
is made clear that on some points opinions differ, when some idea 
is given of the way in which we know what we know, when the child’s 
imagination is led to picture the past in the terms of its on expres- 
sion of itself, then we begin to teach history. 
Let me pause to anticipate an objection. It is not the business of 
the elementary or the high school student to write history or to 
discover new facts or to lose sight of the old facts in discussions of 
critical methods. Neither is that the task of school instruction in 
chemistry or physics; yet we demand laboratory work. It is to get 
away from the dogmatism of the text that we wish gradually 
to introduce a wider reading. It is to implant the interest in the 
live past and to cultivate a taste for historical literature and the 
ability to discriminate between good historical writing and poor 
historical writing. We must try to make both a full man and an 
exact man. 
Such is the program of every discussion of history and history 
teaching by those who know most about it. The various reports— 
those of the committee of seven and the committee of five as to the 
work in the high school, that of the committee of eight on teaching 
in the elementary school—it is expressed in every treatise, such as: 
that of McMurry or that of Bliss. The text-book of Dean Bliss, for 
example, on “History in the Elementary Schools” offers a bibliog- 
raphy of five hundred works.
-P-A-G-E-406

It is not the students only who need books. The teachers’ de- 
mand is equally imperative. The well trained teacher knows this 
and strives to acquire a library. The poorly trained teacher, though 
he may rest in satisfied complacency, needs books to convict him of 
his ignorance and to bring him to a better state of mind. The plea 
that teachers are already overworked and have no time for reading 
is a true and just one, but the remedy is not to dispense with books 
but to have more teachers and give them more time for study and 
self-improvement. Is not the day about due when a reasonable 
knowledge of books and of the use of them in libraries shall be made 
a requirement for certificate of all grades? 
Now let us briefly see what are the facts. 
I have recently seen two interesting letters. One is from a teacher 
in a normal school lately founded by a Southern state. He is a 
teacher not of history, but of a modern language, and I mention this 
letter just to remind my hearers that my arguments for history may 
have a wider application. This normal schools has splendid and 
imposing buildings. He writes for advice as to books for his de- 
partment, and wants to know what he ought to get with the money 
he has. How much do you suppose this fine normal school, which 
is teaching teachers to teach, has placed at his disposal? The sum 
of twenty dollars. 
This is a princely sum. The other letter which has recently come 
under my eye is from a newly elected principal of a high school in 
a county of another state. He is invited to lead in the discussion of 
history at the state high school conference, and have the special 
topic “How to Use Supplementary Reading in the Mesthing of His- 
tory.” He asks for some pointers and says: “If I could only have 
access to Hducation, The Educational Review, The Nation, The At- 
lantic, etc., for a few hours I could get some good material, but we 
have no library at all here.’ Poor man, to be ee a discussion 
of supplementary reading! 
I learn that Texas, one of the most progressive of our Southern 
states, had in 1911 245 counties. At that time 69 counties had in 
the libraries of white country schools not one volume. There were 
1310 such schools in these counties. In the 176 remaining counties 
there were 7,773 white country schools, but only 1,236 had libraries 
of any sort; 15 counties reported as having each a total of 50 
volumes or less in all the white country schools in each county; 36 
counties reported as having each a total of 50 to 150 volumes in 
the white country schools. 
There were 546 independent school districts (town and city) 
schools with 150 or more scholastics; of these 112 sieeriete reported
-P-A-G-E-407
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 407 
no school library ; 74 reported 50 volumes or less; 98 reported 50 to 
150 volumes. 
Column 12 of table 26 in Volume XI of the report of the Com- 
missioner of Education interestingly reveals two facts; first, the lack 
of attention given to answering the questions of the commissioner, 
and, second, the evidence, notwithstanding the insufficient reports, 
of the neglect of school libraries. This table mentions only one high 
school library in Alabama, that in Birmingham, as spending any 
money for library maintenance and the purchase of books. Here the 
sum of $8,182 was so expended—a splendid showing. But what of 
the rest of the states. In Arkansas, too, only one high school re- 
ports any such expenditure, and this is not separated from that of 
the expenditure for general supplies, manual training and labora- 
tory materials. The Tampa High School in Florida spent $35 for 
library maintenance and was alone its glory. I shall not continue 
the roll of the states. As I have said, the table is obviously incom- 
plete, but does not reveal the lack of interest in library matters. Is 
it well for the $308 expenses by Memphis to represent the whole 
‘expenditure in the national report of city high schools in Tennessee 
for library maintenance, when the report of the Superintendent of 
Public Instruction tells a different story? 
What is to be done? The problem of libraries, like all problems, 
must be approached sensibly. To have school libraries we must first 
have schools; to have libraries justify the cost of their institutions 
we must have teachers that can use them. To put libraries in some 
places at the present time would be only to hurt the feelings of the 
books, if they had any feelings. The point of attack must be the 
school or teacher that is ready for a library, that wants a library, 
but has none. This attack may begin from within the community, 
where some enterprising citizen or some devoted teacher takes up 
the cause and fights for it. Unquestionably one of the most hopeful 
and successful steps towards the improvement of present conditions 
has been the provisions for state aid to local school libraries, such 
as is given, for instance, in North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee. 
Public money was never better expended. The growth of libraries 
under this state assistance has been surprising and is still probably 
just in its initial stages. Another plan of most hopeful promise has 
been the establishment of traveling school libraries, such as those 
in Virginia and Kentucky or those which in Tennessee have been 
so successfully developed through the energy of Miss Skeffington. 
In 38 out of the 96 counties in Tennessee there are no less than 228 
traveling school libraries and orders are being filled for 15 special

high school libraries. This system needs some safeguards. Care 
must be taken to use the traveling library as a means to encourage 
the foundation of a permanent local school library and not as a 
substitute for it. Even after the establishment of a permanent 
library, however, the traveling library, if well chosen and constantly 
weeded out, can serve a most valuable purpose as a epee 
agency. Again, the traveling library should be kept closely in touch 
with the department of public instruction and should continue dis- 
tinctly educational, preserving a clear line of cleavage from the 
library, permanent or traveling, that is intended for the community. 
It seems to me that the traveling school library should especially 
bring to the teacher the newest books on the teaching of her sub- 
ject, and that the system should be so mobile that books requested 
by teachers might be added with comparative ease. The state asso- 
ciation of teachers of history might make good suggestions and much 
information could be obtained through the History Teachers’ Maga- 
zine; the same would apply to other subjects. 
I close, then, with the plea for the library in the interest of all 
the teachers, but especially in behalf of the history teacher, to whom, 
and to whose students, books are very meat and drink. As our re- 
sources increase, as we get better trained teachers and better oppor- 
tunities for teachers to develop their own powers, let us urge upon 
school boards, upon departments of education, upon the authorities 
of normal schools, that along with fine buildings, along with equip- 
ment for scientific purposes, along with better salaries and better 
schedules, the matter of books and of instruction in the use of them 
be given the fair and reasonable share of attention and care and 
expenditure, which, thus far, it has not had. Here is a cause where 
teacher and librarian may fight shoulder to shoulder.

MARILLA WAITE FREEMAN, MEMPHIS, TENN.    If we could only draw upon the German language we might surely 
find or frame, with plenty of hyphens and syllables, some one long 
and mighty word which would embrace all that my title seeks to 
say in its rather clumsy English. My wish is to emphasize the 
human, the personal, side of our common task rather than its purely 
technical method. The interesting thing about our work is that we 
both, the high school and the public library, deal with the same raw 
material—human lives in the making. And for a certain period we    
-P-A-G-E-409
    
JOURNAL OF PROOCHEDINGS. 409 
deal side by side with the same group of human lives. In this day 
of scientific management it seems important, therefore, that we 
should coérdinate our efforts. Our first question, then, would be, 
just what we are trying to do with our material, and the second, 
just how we shall best and most economically go at it. 
Well, as to the what, I think we shall agree that our common 
ideal is to have a share in the making of happy, useful, efficient 
human lives. It is a large ambition, but we have at our disposal 
those most potent tools of education—personality and books. If we 
use well our tools, the resulting process will be a vital thing to the 
lives which are molded by it. 
When we ask ourselves how we are going at our task of making 
education fit life, many answers present themselves. I will speak 
only of three points, and first of that which seems most obvious— 
recognition of the fundamental importance of the life career motive. 
What am I going to do with my life, is a question which every boy 
and girl must meet soon or late, a question which both teacher and 
librarian should help the boy and girl to ask and answer. The prob- 
lem of vocational guidance is one of the most widely discussed topics 
in the educational world today. It is coming to be recognized that 
in every high school there should be a trained vocational adviser, one 
who is fitted to “play the delicate and difficult part” of helping each 
pupil to find the work for which he is best fitted and then of plan- 
ning his training for efficiency in that work. Such definite voca- 
tional direction has now been undertaken in several cities, first of 
all, perhaps, in the high schools of New York and Brooklyn, where 
Mr. BE. W. Weaver of the Boys’ High School, Brooklyn, is a pioneer, 
if not the originator of the whole movement; in the Central High 
School of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and notably in the Vocation 
Bureau of Boston, which was organized for the express purpose of 
assisting graduates of the public schools “in choosing wisely the 
most appropriate employment, and in securing the same for them.” 
To prove the demand for such expert guidance in our own com- 
munities, I need only to cite a few of the requests for vocational 
help which have recently come to Goodwyn Institute Library. A 
high school graduate who wishes to support herself asks a list of 
things girls may do beside teaching and stenography; a girl who has 
taste for designing costumes, wants to know where she can train and 
how to use her gift; a mature mechanic wishes to know the best 
nearby, least expensive mechanical engineering course which will 
give him school training; a boy who loves trees, wants to know where 
he can study forestry; another, scientific farming; a high school 
 
-P-A-G-E-410

graduate, eager for a library school training, must earn some money 
first, how? a mature woman interested in social service had had some 
experience as matron of an institution, and has money for training, 
where can she train and for what? a colored girl who has saved 
money to go to the Pacific Coast, seeing in the street cars our library 
card beginning, “What do you want to know,” ventures in to ask 
which Western cities offer best opportunities for her race. 
The list could be extended indefinitely and you will see that the 
library as an informal vocation bureau might easily become an all- 
absorbing field to the librarian. Yet it is in the high school that 
this work most logically belongs, and I hope that our Southern 
schools may help to Jead this new movement toward the special voca- 
tional director. 
Meantime the teacher and the librarian must needs codperate to 
fill this need so far as lies in their power. The ideal high school will, 
of course, have vocational literature, catalogues of special schools and 
so forth, in its own library, either as a branch of the public:library, ° 
as in Newark, N. J., and many other cities, or in some way co- 
érdinated with it, perhaps its books selected and catalogued through 
the public library, and its collection reinforced by temporary loans 
from the library shelves. In the great number of smaller towns 
where this is not feasible the public library will furnish the litera- 
ture of vocational guidance to which the pupil will be directed by 
his teacher. On the part of the teacher there is opportunity for 
observation of a student’s natural bent and for help in guiding his 
education accordingly. The personal friendship and knowledge of 
the teacher may be supplemented by the library’s resources in print 
and by a warm and intelligent interest on the part of the librarian. 
The literature of vocational guidance is already large. The brief 
list which I have compiled to accompany this task is merely sug- 
gestive. (Copies distributed at the meeting.) A much fuller and 
a most helpful list is given by Mr. J: B. Davis in his “Outline of 
Work in Vocational Guidance in the Central High School of Grand 
Rapids, Michigan.” In order to reach all the pupils in the high 
school this work is carried on through the department of English. 
Brief themes and discussions form the basis of the work. Pupils are 
directed in their reading along vocational and ethical lines and are 
advised by teachers who have made a special study of vocational 
guidance. The reading list is arranged under such topics as “Ele- 
ments of Success in Life,” “Biography of Successful Men and 
Women,” “The World’s Work for Men and Women,” “Choosing a 
Vocation,” “Preparation for Life’s Work,” “Business and Social
-P-A-G-E-411
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 411 
Ethics.” This reading list was printed in the Bulletin of the Grand 
Rapids Public Library for October, 1911. Its use by pupils brings 
them into close relation with the public library and its books and 
prepares them to use the library as a sort of continuation school 
after their actual school days are over. To encourage this after- 
school habit the librarian send a printed leaflet letter (copies of this 
leaflet distributed at the meeting) to every graduate of the schools, 
especially of the night schools, under the caption, “Don’t be a quit- 
ter,” inviting him to continue his education through. the public 
library. 
“Blessed is he who has found his work,” says Carlyle, and we 
may add, blessed is he who has found his play. After we have helped 
relate education to the life work we have yet to provide for the 
margin of leisure, and if we have read our Bennett we know that 
the question of how to live on twenty-four hours a day is largely a 
question of what we do with our “spare time.” Every man needs 
to have his avocation as well as his vocation, his life interests, his 
play interests, outside of or accompanying the vital interest of his 
daily work. It does not matter so much whether it is music or 
poetry, mechanics or vegetable gardening, so long as it is a real 
interest. But it is surprising to see the number of young pecpie 
who do not even know how to find out and develop and enjoy what 
does interest them. Surely the teacher has a wonderful opportunity 
to help discover and form such tastes and the public library to foster 
them. The high school library, as a rule, can furnish only the neces- 
sary reference books, and perhaps supplementary reading. It is the 
public library which must supply the literature of recreation. The 
teacher codperating with the librarian can make the pupil feel that 
the public library has something to read about all those things which 
really interest him. In this way the “library habit” may be formed, 
which will hold the pupil after his school days are over. And the 
high school and the library which together have not somehow con- 
trived to develop the library habit—the reading habit—in these boys 
and girls have in so far failed to relate their education to life. For 
to quote Bennett again, “He who has not been ‘presented to the 
freedom’ of literature has not awakened up out of his prenatal sleep. 
He is merely not born; he can’t see; he can’t hear; he can’t feel 
in any fuli sense. He can only eat his dinner. What more than any- 
thing else annoys people who know the true function of literature 
and have profited thereby is the spectacle of so many thousands of 
individuals going about under the delusion that they are alive, when, 
as a fact, they are no nearer being alive than a bear in winter.” And

I suppose if there is anything more than another that schools and 
libraries ought to do it is to help add to the total sum of aliveness. 
And, finally, having recognized the importance of the work motive, 
the play motive, having roused these young minds to self-conscious 
| aliveness as individuals, we have then to waken the social conscious- 
| ness, the recognition of their relation as units to the whole social 
| organism. We have to rouse the social service motive; we have to 
train for citizenship. And with women suffrage so rapidly becoming 
a thing accomplished we need not differentiate as to sex, if indeed 
we should ever have done so, in the necessity of this training for 
citizenship. It is these boys and girls whose lives for a few brief, 
impressionable years touch ours who will make and administer our 
laws, who will form and act upon public opinion, and who will have 
the power to determine whether or not their city, their state, their 
country shall be good, healthful and beautiful places in which to 
live. 
I believe the first step in training for citizenship is to induce an 
attitude of intelligent curiosity toward the immediate environ- 
ment, and the next, to furnish a not too-difficult means of satisfy- 
ing that curiosity. You will recall the particulars of Edwin Clay- 
hanger’s finished education, summed up by his historian—again 
Mr. Arnold Bennett—on the day that Edwin left school. Geog- 
raphy, for example, had been one of Edwin’s strong points. “He 
was aware of the rivers of Asia in their order, and of the principal 
products of Uraguay. * * * * He could have drawn a map of 
the Orinoco River, but he could not have found (his native) Trent 
in a day’s march; he did not even know where his drinking water 
came from.” You remember the picture of Edwin, hanging over 
the canal bridge on his way home from the last day in school, 
watching one boat bringing clay, and another carrying away 
earthenware and wondering suddenly why, if the clay for making 
earthenware was not got in the Five Towns, the Five Towns had 
yet become the great seat of the manufacture. Why were not crocks 
made in the south, where the clay came from? Why should they 
choose just this place to make crocks in? He could think of no 
answer to this enigma, nor had his finished education given him 
any clue. 
To know why just crocks or plows or furniture are made in just 
our town is more important than it first sounds, and a knowledge 
of where our drinking water comes from is a first essential to good 
citizenship.

library in securing a practical knowledge of their own environment

to the school children of a city, is in operation in Newark, N. J. 
The book recently issued by the Board of Education, called “Newark 
Study,” represents probably the first thought and systematic course 
of study of a city in its own schools. The Newark Library was the 
founder of this study course for Newark children. The work began 
in the search for local material to lend to young visitors to the 
children’s room. So little was found that the library prevailed 
upon a local writer to prepare a simple history of the origin and 
development of the city. Later, short accounts were compiled of 
streets, parks, water supply, health, fire and police departments, 
schools, industries and many other factors and aspects of the city’s 
life. The Newark study stories were printed by the thousand, dis- 
tributed to the teachers and lent to the children. Now the Board 
of Education has prepared a large book containing a complete in- 
dex and manual of all this material, with directions for the formal 
courses of study in the several grades. 
The book is divided into: Part 1—Geography, a study of New- 
ark as a type of the industrial and commercial city; Part 2—Civic 
hygiene and civics; Part 3—Biographical sketches of men and 
women of Newark, and a course of study in history. The very com- 
plete and comprehensive index was prepared by the library, and 
the mass of clippings, pamphlets, books and pictures, to which it 
has many references, are gathered there for use by pupils and 
teachers. The library and the schools, thus working together, be- 
lieve that “a generation of Newarkers is growing up that will know 
more about their own town than any citizens ever knew before 
about the city in which they live. They are justified in believing 
that knowledge will bring with it faith, and that the Newark of 
ten and twenty years from now will be a city with a civic spirit, a 
city with ideals, a city that accomplishes things.” 
We cannot do things upon the Newark scale, perhaps, but we 
can all do something to make our children better citizens of the 
future, and the Newark plan may give us many hints toward a be- 
ginning. 
The great democratic opportunity for training in citizenship is 
the high school debate. For teaching pupils to think for them- 
selves, and to express their thoughts, for broadening their mental 
horizons and for arousing their interest in the great public ques- 
tions they will some day have to decide, the exercise of debate is 
unequaled. The choice of subjects for debate is largely influenced 
by the teacher. The relative merits of Napoleon and Julius Cesar 
may well be neglected for such immediate problems as (to return

to our drinking water) the arguments for and against municipal 
waterworks for the town, or the advantages and disadvantages of 
a commission form of government. Down in Memphis just now the 
boys and girls of public and private schools are debating the need 
of a new constitution for Tennessee, and the abolishment of the fee 
. system for state and county officials, the relation between crime 
and illiteracy, and best means of managing the flood waters of the 
Mississippi, that mighty trouble-maker, of which a Southern orator 
declared that God made the Mississippi River and then turned it 
loose, and no one has ever been able to contro! it since. We cannot 
doubt these boys and girls will grow into the sort of citizens who 
get things done, and mark the difference between a progressive and 
an unprogressive community. 
There are a number of debate handbooks which not only the 
public library, but even the small high school library should have 
upon its shelves as aids in choice of subjects and in method of treat- 
ment. <A brief list of the most useful of these is appended. 
It is the part of the public library, and one of its most important 
duties, to have ready for use by debaters and students, not only 
back and current numbers of the most valuable magazines indexed 
in Poole’s Index and Reader’s Guide to Periodical Literature, but 
also ephemeral leaflet and pamphlet matter on the social problems 
and public questions of the day. Much of this material may be 
obtained free of charge, or at small cost, from the United States 
Government and from various organizations. 
Two lists* may be mentioned from which the addresses of such or- 
ganizations may be secured. The first is “Social Questions of To- 
day; Selected Sources of Information, compiled by the Free Public 
Library, Newark, N. J.,” obtainable from J. A. Lapp, State Library, 
Indianapolis, for ten cents. The second, “The Library and Social 
Movements ;” a list of material obtainable free or at small expense, 
may be had from the A. L. Publishing Board, 78 East Washing- 
ton Street, Chicago, for five cents. From the addresses in these two 
lists, a splendid collection of working material on the live ques- 
tions of the day may be gathered by any library at small cost. The 
high school student who, through the codperation of teacher and 
librarian, has been brought to consciousness of these questions as 
vital subjects for study and debate, is on the way to become an in- 
telligent citizen when his school days are over. 
In this brief effort to cover so large a theme, I have perhaps not 
given sufficient prominence to the exact method and technique of

codrdination between the high school and the public library. Yet 
it has seemed to me most important today that we should recog- 
nize just what we are designing, and together working toward 
with our tools of education, in the shaping of human lives. If we 
can share and inspire the life enthusiasm for work, for play, for 
social service, without which education cannot procure the highest 
happiness or efficiency, I believe the ways and means of codpera- 
tion will shape themselves. “Education for efficiency,” says Presi- 
dent Eliot, “must not be materialistic, prosaic or utilitarian 5. it 
must be idealistic, humane and passionate, or it will not win its 
goal.” 
Women’s Department. 
The Women’s Department of the Southern Educational Associa- 
tion met in Room 209, Girls’ High School, Friday, November 29, 
1912, 2:00 p.m. One hundred and twenty-five persons present. The 
following program was carried out: 
General subject: Vital Problems—1. Are Changes Needed in the 
Curricula for Girls and: Women? Dr. Irene T. Meyers, Dean of 
Women, Transylvania University, Lexington, Ky. 
Dr. Meyers presented her paper, which was changed somewhat in 
title: “The Adaptation of the Curricula of Our Schools to 
Women and Girls.” (This paper is printed in full below.) 
The next paper on the program was by Dr. Sophonisba Brecken- 
ridge, from Department of Social Investigation, Russell Sage Foun- 
dation, Chicago, School of Civics and Philanthrophy. Dr. Brecken- 
ridge spoke extempore. The following is a digest of her most in- 
teresting and valuable talk: 
Miss Breckenridge’s paper was a plea for more freedom for the 
teacher in the doing of social work, and for a more efficient body of 
social workers to do that which the teacher cannot by the nature 
of her duties, do. 
“In my work at Chicago,” said Dr. Breckenridge, “I am often 
asked by some eager, well-trained teacher: ‘Can you tell me some 
way of getting into social work? I find that the schoolroom is 
hampering, I want to get out.’ 
“My answer must be, as you can see: ‘If you have not.found an 
opportunity to do social work in the schoolroom, where do you ex- 
pect to find it?’ 
“To which they reply: ‘As school systems are organized today, 
it is impossible for me to meet the social needs of the children 
whom I teach.’
-P-A-G-E-416
  416 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
PROBLEM UP OFTEN, 
“This problem comes up again and again. While teaching does 
give unparalleled opportunity for contact between the teacher 
and child, I can plainly see the many things which come between 
and hinder the fuilest results of this relation. 
“The plea which I am, therefore, making today is a double one. 
I ask that the teacher shall be put in the position to do everything 
possible for the child, and that an expert body of social workers be 
ready to do the thing she cannot do. The present system hinders 
the resourcefulness of the teacher. She is held down by the small- 
ness of her salary—it is so stupid the way we use seventy-five-dol- 
lar people to do fifteen-dollar work—she is restrained by technical 
work, reports and so on. It is time that the teacher should be set 
free—to use her emotional judgment and her fullest mental powers. 
Our social responsibilities are infinite—the work must be done in 
the home as well as in the school.” 
Dr. Breckenridge then took up the question of vocational educa- 
tion, bringing out the need of having an expert person to advise 
with boys and girls about their life work. 
FREE TO TRAIN CHILD. 
“The teacher,” concluded Dr. Breckenridge, “should be free to do 
the utmost with the child in the school, while the vocational ad- 
visor must do specialized work, enter into the home and find out 
what is really needed. We must build up a technique for the treat- 
ment of each individual on his merits and qualifications. 
“Therefore, what we must have is a school for social workers. 
We are in a transitional period. We must set out to equip those 
who are to do the new work. The point I make is, that the teachers 
need social workers with whom to codperate. The individal must 
be socially related to his treatment. My plea is made in behalf of 
the teacher and of the children, who are so greatly in need today of 
this double service.” 
Dean Talbot, Dean of Women, Chicago University, followed Dr. 
Breckenridge with a brief extempore talk on “The Dangers of Me- 
chanical Education.” The following is a digest: 
ACCUSTOMED TO RUT. 
“I believe,” said Dean Talbot, “that the men engaged in educa- 
tional work have made a fetish of system—and we have got to be 
yery careful not to follow them. Too much time is given these days 
to the technique of education. We are too much engrossed with
-P-A-G-E-417

the curriculum and too little concerned with the youths and young 
girls in our classes. I think the women must make an effort to 
change this attitude. It is the letter that killeth and the spirit 
which keepeth alive.” 
Dean Anna J. Hamilton, Dean of Women, State University of 
Kentucky, gave a paper on “The Qualifications of Deans of Women 
in Universities and Colleges.” She emphasized the need of a broad 
training for this work. She also emphasized the growing need for 
supervision of women, where there are large numbers, not only in 
Universities, colleges and normal schools, but in high schools also. 
She suggested there should be an assistant principal in high 
schools—a woman—who could begin this supervision work with 
younger women, and thus help to lessen the heavy responsibility of 
the dean of women in universities and colleges. 
At the close of her address, an organization was formed of the 
deans of women of the South, from universities, colleges and nor- 
mal schools. The following officers were elected: 
President, Dean Irene T. Meyers, Transylvania University, Lex- 
ington, Ky. 
Vice-President, Dean Many ©. Roark, Richmond (Ky.) Normal 
School. 
Secretary, Dean Anna J. Hamilton, Kentucky State University. 
No officers were elected for the Woman’s Department, upon the 
advice of Secretary Feagin. 
The meeting then adjourned. 
The sense of those present was that the meeting was one of profit 
and pleasure and strong in future outlook. 
Anna J. Hamitton, Secretary. 
Tae ADAPTATION OF THE CurRICULA or Our ScHooLts TO WOMEN 
AND GIRLS. 
DEAN IRENE T. MEYERS, 
Before we can discuss the adaptation of the curricula of the 
schools to the education of women, we must have some definite con- 
viction as to its aim. Personally, I like that statement by Spencer, 
that education is to fit one to live completely. I take it that this 
idea implies, in the one being educated, both personal growth and 
social efficiency, and that it applies to women equally with men. 
We paraphrase it frequently into “to fit for life,’ and then be- 
come confused by statements about vocational training, which we 
are told fits for life, and liberal training, which we are told aims 
27 -
-P-A-G-E-418
  418 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
only at broad culture. The two sorts are frequently presented to 
‘us in antithesis, the aim of one contrasted with that of the other, 
but I confess myself entirely unable to draw a line between them. 
What is broad culture for, if it also is not to fit for life? These 
vague, undefined statements do not clarify my thinking on this 
subject. I do not find than I am at all clear in my mind as to what 
is meant by vocational education. I do know that if we concen- 
trate all our energies in the schools upon making women sten- 
ographers, cooks, seamstresses, or any other sort of tradeswomen, 
we are said to be giving vociational training. I know that sim- 
ilarly, if we concentrate our energies upon making them physicians, 
nurses, teachers, lawyers, or any other sort of professional women, 
we are also said to be giving vocational training. But when we 
attempt to fit them primarily for their responsibilities as wives, 
mothers and citizens, is that also vocational training? It cer- 
tainly seems to me to be so, but if so, there is nothing very new in 
the general direction of the training. From time immemorial, 
to increase their efficiency as wives and mothers has been the ob- 
ject of women’s education. The emphasis upon their efficiency as 
citizens is, so far as I know, a modern addition. 
Moreover, in the training of a stenographer, for instance, shall 
we consider facility in shorthand writing the only object to be 
sought, because it may assure her an immediate living wage? Or 
shall we consider it also vocational to broaden her mind as far as 
possible by other studies? I can enumerate a long list that is re- 
lated at least indirectly to stenography, a mastery of which would 
help her greatly to increase her earning capacity as time goes on, 
which would also increase her capacity for happiness, aud would 
make her of more service to her fellows. I should not know where 
the so-called fitting for life ended and broad culture began. 
However, whether we consider the equipment of women to live 
intelligently, happily and helpfully in their domestic and civie re- 
lations vocational or not, these unquestionably are the relations upon 
which most emphasis must be laid in the curriculum, for the trades- 
women and the professional women, as well as the others, in addi- 
tion to being fitted for the particular wage-earning calling which 
may be theirs, must also, in most instances be primarily conceried 
with service to their families. Let us consider our curriculum then 
with reference to its adaptatien to this fundamental object. 
I must confess my confidence in the value of the old subjects for 
this purpose. I do not believe that we need new subjects so much as 
we need a new teaching of the old.

Why, for instance, should chemistry ever be a detached subject, 
related to nothing in the women’s experience, when it underlies mat- 
ters so universally interesting as food values for plants and beasts 
and man, and women have gardens and houses and husbands? 
Why should the principals of physics be illustrated by the work- 
ings of unfamiliar machinery, when they might be applied to vacuum 
cleaners, to the lighting, heating and plumbing of the dwelling? 
Why should botany and biology be used simply to stimulate and 
satisfy a student’s curiosity, laudable as this may be, when they 
might be used to illuminate and purify and dignify our physical life 
and its functions? 
Why should psychology seem to weave filmy abstractions about 
our immaterial selves, when it might throw light on the tense rela- 
tions existing between mistress and maid, on the devastations of a 
mob, on the sweet mysteries of childhood? 
Further, a continuously increasing number of people demands 
that woman take up her duties as a citizen. They believe that as 
wife and mother, all that pertains to the right management of her 
city, state and nation; all that makes for a happier, healthier, more 
intelligent life, concerns the physical and spiritual health of her 
family, and is legitimately her business, in which she cannot, with- 
out shirking, refuse to participate. 
I covet for every woman whose face is set courageously toward 
this grave future the companionship of all those great souls of the 
past and the present who have reflected and interpreted human 
society in literature. I covet for her the clarifying sweep of his- 
tory, the illumination of economics and sociology, that she may 
understand the evolution of society and its problems. I covet for 
her all that ethics can give to develop her sense of moral responsi- 
bility for society and to it. I would have the old subjects of the 
curriculum vitalized by application to modern needs and expressed 
in terms of modern life. 
Again, we shall all agree, I believe, that the wife and mother, if 
she is to stand in any other than a physical and emotional relation 
toward her family, must be mentally active, and this result is not 
to be attained by minimizing, in her school work, her expenditure 
of mental energy. We know from experience that a purposeless 
immersion in the so-called liberal studies cannot be relied upon to 
stimulate her to mental activity, but neither can the reading of 
temperatures, nor the recording of measurements, the filling out of 
formule on printed blanks, which constitutes a large part of much 
of our so-called vocational preparation, be relied upon to do it.

Personally, I do not regard the technical process of cooking as 
very valuable in this particular. Many generations of negro 
women, specialized experts, remain singularly unstirred by it if 
it has much value. On the other hand, the strong scientific foun- 
dation which should underlie it, but which rarely does, at least in 
our Southern schools, should be a vitalizing part of the curriculum. 
The fact that there are problems which arise that are not con- 
cerned simply with each day’s marketing, but relate themselves to 
general economic laws, involving the questions of trusts and monop- 
olies, of tariffs and free trade, of labor and transportation and 
other pending modern issues, cannot fail, if properly presented, to 
be a great stimulant to intellectual activity. 
Doubtless you are thinking that what I have said applies only 
to the adaptation of a college curriculum to a woman’s life, and I 
have been looking at this matter from the point of view of a college 
teacher. It is the only point of view from which I feel, even in a 
measure, qualified to speak. I turn reluctantly to the curricula 
of the secondary and elementary schools, realizing that here I can 
offer only theory. 
However, it seems to me that the same general principles ought 
to hold good in the adaptation of these curricula. And in saying 
this I am not unmindful of the perplexing fact that a small percent- 
age of those who enter the high school continue through its course, 
and that a large percentage of the elementary pupils do not enter 
it at all. 
We are told that some of them drop out because they want to 
earn money, others because they have to. JI cannot see that in 
justice to either of these classes we should permit them to shut 
themselves out from as broad a view of the world, from as intelli- 
gent a comprehension of themselves and as sympathetic a knowledge 
of their human relationships as it is possible to give them in the 
brief time they stay. It would seem to me cruel to take advantage, 
on the one hand, of youth’s mistaken judgment of educational 
values, and on the other, of the pressure of necessity, to make these 
children intellectually hewers of wood and drawers of water to the 
end of their days. We may be able to give them in a brief space 
a certain degree of industrial skill—industrially efficient we cannot 
make them—but I do not believe that we can afford to emphasize 
this acquirement at the expense of the individual’s growth, and of 
her service to the community. 
To attain this superficial industrial skill, the training must be 
narrowed, the shop method of instruction employed, and the victim

inevitably limited in her chances for development and progress. It 
is a short-sighted policy that trains for immediate independence at 
the expense of the future; that will, to place it upon a commercial 
plane, assure the present wage, but provide for nothing better ten 
years hence. 
Perhaps you know the story of the man who stammered, and who 
went to a specialist to be cured. The specialist trained him on 
“Peter Piper” until he could repeat it perfectly. “What you must 
do is to learn a specific thing, and keep on repeating it,” said the 
specialist. The result was wonderful. It was exhibited to 
admiring friends, who said, enthusiastically: “Remarkable! It’s 
all the result of specialization.” Yes,” said the man, “b-b-but I 
d-d-don’t s-s-see how I c-e-can work it into general c-c-conversation.” 
Over against my theorizing you are mentally marshalling some 
actual conditions, I do not doubt. What of the girls, you ask, 
who must work, trained to a vocation or untrained, who must leave 
the school as soon as they legally may, and whose own young hands 
must ward off from themselves starvation or worse? Certainly 
no one of us would send them out without the safeguard of what- 
ever measure of skill could be given them, but might not that skill 
be acquired in some form of continuation school, and even these 
girls have their chances to widen their horizons. 
Our school buildings are practically unused in the evenings, on 
Saturdays and during the summers, and at these times they might 
be entirely devoted to some forms of industrial training. Indeed, 
the pressure of modern conditions demands that we use less waste- 
fully our school equipment and our time. I do not therefore see 
that it is necessary for the old subjects in the curricula to make way 
before the demand for shop training. All the more would I pre- 
serve them as a balance to it. 
Moreover, I think that a high quality of common sense should be 
possessed by the people charged with the duty of providing this 
training. It is the place where superintendents are most likely 
to yield weakly to imitation, and thus cause a wicked misappropria- 
tion of money. To illustrate, conditions in large cities like 
Chicago or Atlanta, may render proper the appropriation of public 
money for certain kinds of training which would not be at all 
demanded by our largely rural Southern life. Yet we frequently 
provide the best imitation we can of what the large complex commu- 
nity has found good, and think that we thereby show progress. 
Instead, we show lack of judgment. 
Even in providing for training in cooking I think that the 
resources of the locality should be closely scrutinized. I know a

mother in a prosperous Southern community who gave her daugh- 
ter lessons in baking during one summer vacation; during another 
they made pickles and preserves, and during a third her daughter 
learned to manage the dairy. With varying degree of thorough- 
ness most of her neighbors in that community were training their 
daughters in like fashion. It is a very different condition from 
that which obtains in homes where mothers are forced to go out as 
wage-earners, where poverty presses too heavily to permit of experi- 
ment in the home kitchen. I do not believe that it is the duty of 
the state to make an elaborate provision for techical training in 
such a well-to-do community as it should in the poorer community. 
Nor do I think it good for the mothers to be relieved by the state 
of the responsibility of training their daughters in so far as they 
can. We need to protect, not obliterate, all sympathetic points of 
contact between mothers and daughters, and whenever the curricu- 
lum can be adjusted to subserve this purpose, it should be. 
To sum up: I think that the chief element in the adaptation of 
a school curriculum to women and girls, is in the teaching instead 
of in the subject; that a broadly vocational spirit should give point 
and direction to the usual arts—college studies; that a broadly cul- 
tural spirit should give vision and catholicity to the usual tech- 
nical studies; and finally, that where the needs of a community 
demand it, carefully chosen trades should be taught in the school 
buildings, but that they should be an addition to the literal and 
cultural studies and not in place of them; that those who direct and 
give form to education should be remarkable for common sense as 
wel! as equipped by training for their positions.

All the speakers were present but Dr. Fred Mutchler, Bowling 
Green, Ky., who attended the convention, but substituted in another

Mr. James Speed was called to the chair. 
Although the attendance was small, what we lacked in numbers 
was made up in enthusiasm. 
Because of some trouble with the wiring of the building, the 
stereopticon talks planned by Mr. Speen and Miss Yunker were 
given without slides.

Miss Yunker emphasized the necessity for school gardens in the 
city, a place where they are most needed. A close correlation with 
geography, arithmetic, reading, language and literature was urged. 
The making of home gardens was strongly recommended. Many 
pictures of gardens made by Louisville children on vacant lots 
and in home and school yards were shown. 
A discussion by Prof. H. F. Triplett, Beaumont, Texas, fol- 
lowed. He said that school gardens should be part of the child’s 
training. He stated that in the Central City School of Beaumont, 
floriculture is receiving much attention, and much effective, scien- 
tific work is being done in the study of soils, fertilizer, germination 
and plant growth. 
Miss Nannie Lee Frayser, Louisville, Ky., led in a discussion on 
“The Best Incentive to Civic Pride.’ She emphasized (1) the 
necessity for encouraging a sense of cleanliness; (2) a sense of 
respect for the child’s own things and those of others; (3) a fellow- 
feeling for his classmates; (4) a sense of gratitude for the many 
advantages they have. 
In her school, the children are taught the Athenian oath, and 
are encouraged to live up to it. 
Prof. Wm. R. Webb, Jr., Bell Buckle, Tenn., in endeavoring to 
stir up civic pride among the negroes of his town, stated that clean- 
liness was commended and prizes, pictures and seeds were offered 
for greatest improvement of surroundings. : 
Mr. James Speed, Louisville, Ky., said there was no more power- 
ful organ than the press in trying to make the people realize what 
the school is trying to do. That it has helped rouse Kentuckians 
to a sense of their duty toward the school question. 
Kentucky has been moved up three notches. The press has 
helped put it there. 
Prof. N. R. Baker, Montgomery, Ala., in his discussion advocated 
that in the improvement of the rural school, the yard should be like 
the home garden, the building like a residence. 
He commended the commencement exercises of a progressive 
school. Such demonstrations as (1) how to build a fire; (2) how to 
construct a book-case; (3) household drill; (4) preparations of 
vegetables raised in garden, took place in the kitchen. 
In fact, all the exercises took a decidedly practical turn. In all 
the papers, the doing, rather than so much talk about what ought 
to be done, was emphasized.

“How To Improve our Rurau ScHoors.” 
N. 2, BAKER, STATE SUPERVISOR RURAL SCHOOLS OF ALABAMA, 
Set in a large, beautiful grove of oaks, with an abundant shade 
and yet apertures among the boughs for thousands of dancing sun- 
beams, is an attractive looking building which one time was a resi- 
dence. Now it is used for the school children of a certain mill 
town in Alabama. 
The Principal’s genial “Come in” must have been pronounced 
from habit, we thought, as every available inch of space seemed 
occupied. She asked if it did not remind us of a line of the poem 
in McGuffey’s Reader which we learned as children, “We were 
crowded in the cabin.” 
Notwithstanding, the children sang beautifully, or at least lustily. 
The building was clean and every means of natural ventilation was 
employed. I measured the floors of the five rooms used as school- 
rooms. The total floor space was 1,726 square feet. Allowing 15 
square feet of floor space to the pupil (though 20 square feet would 
be better), this building would seat properly 115. Actually 312 
pupils were present. Three and sometimes four occupied one 
double desk. Such a thing as relaxing by filing or marching or 
other forms of physical exercises was impossible. The five rooms 
averaged 63 pupils each. The smallest of these, but one which 
carried its full quota was 15x18 feet in size, or large enough for 
18 pupils. This room was lighted by two windows, one of them 
obscured by a covered porch. Thus the actual available window 
space, instead of being one-sixth of the floor space, was about one- 
sixteenth; and this it was necessary to obscure with a shade for a 
part of the day when the sun shone. Therefore, 63 pupils were 
sometimes compelled to study in a light inadequate for ten. In 
another room built for 22 there were seats for 44 occupied by 58 
pupils. 
In nearly all cotton mill schools a somewhat similar condition 
exists. This is one of the problems of the South. In many cases 
these vicinities should be annexed to the adjoining cities and ade- 
quate sanitary houses built by issuing bonds. In such communi- 
ties the patrons cannot and the owners generally will not build 
adequate houses. Again, these owners and the patrons of almost 
any district do not know how to build and equip school buildings. 
It should be left absolutely to expert school architects and expe- 
rienced, intelligent school superintendents and supervisors. 
Alabama offers state aid to at least five rural school buildings 
in each county each year. It stipulates that there must be two 
 
-P-A-G-E-425
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 425 
acres of ground and that the building must be built according to 
plans and specifications furnished by the State department. These 
specifications even tell why the windows should be placed just so, 
quoting in full ten laws of fenestration. 
By means of a sanitation and decoration score card a record of 
the condition of the yard and exterior, the floor and walls of the 
interior, the water supply, the ventilation, equipment and decora- 
tion is recorded. 
By means of a school gardening report direct to the State Super- 
intendent schools are encouraged to utilized a part of this two acres 
for gardens. 
By means of a trustees’ report direct to the county superintend- 
ent they are made familiar with thirty-four points of equipment and 
essential features of an ideal school. 
Many of these points, such as (a) direction of light, (b) plans 
for improvement (c) treatment of the floor for sanitation, (d) lit- 
erary society, (e) library, etc., may never have come heretofore 
within the vision of the trustee as any integral part of a school. 
ScHoot GARDENS. 
MISS EMILIE YUNKER, LOUISVILLE, 
In dealing with the vital educational problems of today, we can 
scarcely afford to leave out the school garden. Studying nature 
from a book is uninteresting, unnatural and uneducative; studying 
nature in a garden is interesting, natural and educative. 
To strive for a clean yard, whether at home or at school, is a 
very good thing, but only a beginning. Since beauty has its moral 
effect upon the child, make the grounds as attractive as possible. 
Weedy yards are repellant; beautiful gardens pleasing and inviting. 
The old Greeks before Socrates’ time were right in their belief 
that “if children could be surrounded by masterpieces in literature 
and art, have good music, and come in contact with the beauties of 
nature, there would be no question as to their conduct. 
A garden made by a gardener is a very good thing, but one made 
by children has the greatest educational value. Every child loves 
to plant things. He craves the outdoor life, the fresh air, the sun- 
shine, the digging in the dirt the moment he begins to toddle at 
his mother’s knee. But this dirt is not dangerous. Dr. Woods 
Hutchinson says: “No dirt is more dangerous than that of bed- 
room and kitchen, and children are like cabbages in that they need 
plenty of dirt to grow in. The only clean dirt grows in the open
-P-A-G-E-426
    426 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
air. When nature’s house cleansers—the sun, the rain and the 
wind— get a fair chance at it, they will make it clean and sweet 
for plantlets, human and otherwise.” 
The children in our rural districts are doubly fortunate in that 
they do not only live in a garden, but receive instructions in agri- 
culture. Crops, besides being improved thereby, are marvelously 
increased. These boys learn that “ten bushels to an acre is more 
the fault of the soil robber than the soil; that the man counts more 
than the land; that ten times ten bushels means a good farmer and 
a useful citizen.” 
We are proud to note that four thousand boys in Kentucky grew 
an acre of corn this year. One of these raised 132 bushel on 
92-100 of an acre. Tomato clubs were organized for the girls. 
But what are we doing for the city children, many of whom live 
in congested quarters. They need the sunshine, the fresh air, the 
contact with the soil and should come in contact with nature. They 
need it for the training it offers. : 
Such a wide range of interests cannot be found in any other 
field. The school garden belongs to the city. 
In order to stimulate an interest in planting the home as well 
as the school garden, flower and vegetable seeds have been offered 
the Louisville school children for several years. As a result, 42,981 
packets were sold in 1912. To further stimulate this work, 800 
bulbs were offered to the school who showed the largest percentage 
of children who cultivated home and school gardens. Many excel- 
lent reports were received: 71 per cent of the pupils at the Normal 
School cultivated gardens, 64 per cent at the Kentucky State School 
and 63 per cent at the Longfellow School. Among the colored 
schools, Maiden Lane and South Louisville stand highest. 
But many school yards are small. There is scarcely room to 
play in, much less to plant in. It is possible, however, to place 
gardens or school farms in thickly populated districts, as New York, 
Cleveland and Philadelphia are doing. 
The work may have to be conducted on a very small scale at 
first, but that need not discourage us. As your garden grows in 
usefulness, by persevering, you may be able to secure more ground; 
if not adjoining the school, somewhere in the neighborhood. There 
are vacant lots galore—weedy, unsightly and unsanitary—which 
could be turned into gardens, clean sanitary and useful as well as 
beautiful. 
The fact that school gardens are not planted merely to grow a 
few vegetables and flowers cannot be too strongly emphasized. As 
 
-P-A-G-E-427
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 427 
the study of food plants—such as grains, nuts and fruits—and fiber 
plants—such as hemp and cotton raised in the observation plot 
correlate with geography; as measuring the plot; drawing a plan to 
scale, keeping accounts correlate with arithmetic; making of pot 
labels, markers, the digging and planting correlate with the indus- 
trial training; observations and experiences recorded correlate 
with language and reading; the study of flowers in garden, field 
and forest correlates with literature. We should make a strong 
plea for their establishment everywhere, and give school gardening 
a place in the curriculum. 
Think what a wealth of material can be furnished the art depart- 
ment! It may lead to the planting of an aboretum, and to the 
establishment of a large botanical garden, where students from all 
schools can observe and get specimens for nature and art. 
When the children learn to love the plants they see and handle, 
when they learn that beauty and freshness can be obtained at small 
cost, they will carry the idea home and make a garden there. The 
neighbors and passers-by catch the inspiration, vacant lots will be 
cultivated, a vine will be planted for a sign, and a rose for a thistle. 
No better training for good citizenship could be given than this. 
We might ultimately have conditions like those in Germany, 
where no weeds are ever seen, even by the wayside or along the rail- 
way. We might have shade trees as those in Berlin, Paris and 
Hamburg, beautifying the thoroughfares and furnishing shade for 
man and beast. The children could easily learn to plant them 
in the school nursery, and later on place them along the sidewalks. 
The garden does much more for the child than the child does 
for the garden. It develops the brain, creates nature sympathy, 
enlarges the muscle, deepens breathing, broadens the chest, stimu- 
lates activity, begets responsibility, produces thrist, awakens rever- 
ence and makes good citizens.

In the beginning of the ages of human life, perfect happiness was 
found in a garden. This happiness was negative, being uninspired 
by the life uplift that ever accompanies directive effort, conquest of 
encompassing forces, and richly compensating rewards for voli- 
tional labor. 
As in all the intervening ages, a Divinity has overruled all seem- 
ing adversities, so that the necessary overcoming effort for sur- 
 
-P-A-G-E-428

mounting them has brought invigorating power, strength and hap- 
piness to the heroic toiler, so did the so-called “curse of labor” inure 
to man’s happiness in accordance with the well-ordered plan of 
Divinity. 
As curiosity, investigative propensity and test ultimatum 
brought the fruits of knowledge to the Edenic pair, these same ele- 
ments, in their descendents, have been the touchstones that have 
brought out the latent riches of earth and air and sea as human 
needs required them. 
He who has not “earned his bread by the sweat or his face” has 
never known the supreme exquisiteness of the gustatory delights of 
the laborer’s loaf. 
The aristocrat’s boy knows nothing of the keen sense delights 
of the husbandman’s son who has helped supply the table from the 
well-tilled garden. 
An interest and a participation in life activities that give tangi- 
ble rewards for effort are essential to youth development. 
The school grist of the “Three R’s” has been the bane of every 
urchin who has experienced the irksome grind of the schoo! mill. 
Were it not for the recess delights of the playgrounds where boys 
and girls taste the delights of joyous companionships in games and 
sports, school attendance could only be secured through compulsion. 
I have read of the wonders of dry farming in the Panhadle and 
in similar sections where Pluvius seldom deigns to give his bless- 
ings, and I have heard of the enchantments of a school where chil- 
dren were entranced by the spirit uplift of the interest charged 
characters of the alphabet in their hide-and-seek types of cap and 
small, print and script forms, and of the enchanting beauties of the 
multiplication table in its interest-thralling changes; but in my 
halfscore years of farm life, and my twoscore years in school work 
as pupil, teacher and supervisor I have yet to see such resultants. 
I still sympathize with the boys who view with envy the measles- 
marked lad who glories in his school respite. I have only seen 
good results where interest larded work and practically applied 
lessons were dominant. 
The primary teacher succeeds who gives to her children lessons 
that are interpreted in child experience on the playground and in 
the home life, and who gives a play interest to all primary school

The grammar school teacher succeeds who gives a practical and

and science lessons that community phase which enables her pupils 
to carry new ideas and effective methods to society to its evident

School gardens and small tracts for experimental agriculture 
and horticulture afford variation and degrees in plant culture that 
appeal to each group of pupils according to the group maturity. 
Horticulture, as well as agriculture, is applied science of the best, 
the most practical, and the most highly educative kind. Its pres- 
ent introduction into the curricula of our public schools, under 
interested and expert supervision is the richest contribution ever 
made to our school courses. The sanitary conditions under which 
this work is conducted, the intimate connection it has with the 
pupil’s daily life, its practical value in giving social efficiency, its 
insistent demands for close observation, safe deductions and perse- 
yering activities, make it the most satisfactory preparation our 
schools afford for practical life preparation. Properly correlated 
with schoolroom work, it is only practical preparation afforded 
pupils for the fundamental industry of our country. 
Said the teacher-statesman, Garfield, “At the head of all the 
sciences and arts, at the head of civilization, and progress, stands— 
not militarism, the science that kills; not commerce, the art that 
accumulates wealth; but—agriculture, the mother of all industry 
and the maintainer of human life.” 
Rightly presented in connection with the traditional work of the 
common school, the study of plant life with plant life conditions 
becomes a priceless boon to rich and poor alike. It democratizes 
all pupils, gives tangible results to the well-directed efforts of all 
pupils alike, makes nature lovers of all chidren, gives all the health- 
bringing blessings of earth, and air, and sunshine, and inspires 
every pupil with properly exalted views of the dignity of labor. 
It tends to free society both of drones and paupers. It will 
tend to still the social discontent of today, and will bring into exist 
ence a social world where no pessimist can echo the old refrain: 
“A rich man sat himself down one night to dine; 
Rare was his food, superb his priceless wine. 
A poor man, hungry, lurked about the gate, 
And craved a crum off the rich man’s plate. 
Yet neither the rich man nor the poor ate that night; 
One had no food, and one no appetite.”

Thoughtful school people are beginning to realize that our edu- 
cational system is drifting our people away from normal life, away 
from their heritage in nature’s riches and nature’s blessings, and 
away from the natural to the artificial; away from the simple, 
wholesome, uplifting lessons of earth life to the high-keyed, neu- 
rotic, soul-racking demands of our heartless commercialism; away 
from the divinely fixed standards of physical excellency, social effi- 
ciency and altruistic activities, to the standards of man-gauged, 
dollor-success, industrial dominancy, and political ascendency. 
They are beginning to realize that the present system tends to 
give to the world young men and young women with hothouse cul- 
ture, neurotic temperament and anemic physiques, instead of giving 
to the world matured youths of sense power, sagacious culture and 
robust bodies. 
So a reaction is beginning to set in. The kindergarten is seek- 
ing to keep the sense development and the muscle growth of the 
under primary pupils in equal advancement. The primary school 
is beginning to make nature work and nature activities to precede, 
to attend, and to follow the “Three R’s.” In fact, we are begin- 
ning to use reading, writing, and spelling as expression agencies for 
nature knowledge. 
The grammar school is beginning to vitalize geography, vivify 
language, particularize arithmetic, and coordinate all with life 
activities and nature-wooing work. 
The life-giving soil, the health-freighted sunshine, and the spirit- 
exhilarating atmosphere are now being our youths’ utilized heritage 
by the wise employment of school gardens, field plants and nursery 
grounds. 
Children love the outdoor life and the touch of the soil. They 
love the grass and its eaters, the flowers and their butterfly lovers, 
the plants of the soil and the birds of the air. 
As it so aptly gives an insight into boy nature, I am constrained 
to quote from the great plant wizard of the Golden State: “Every 
child should have sand, mudpies, grasshoppers, tadpoles, frogs, 
elderberries, acorns, chestnuts, trees to climb, brooks to wade in, 
rocks to roll, animals to pet, bats, bees, butterflies and hay fields; 
and any child who has been deprived of these has been deprived of 
the best part of his education.” 
In our state, the state once described by a wee Lone Star lad as 
being the only biggest state in the United States, gardening and 
scientific farming are being taught in a great number of our schools.
-P-A-G-E-431
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 431 
Seventy-four of our public schools are cultivating gardens and 
small tracts under state aid and expert supervision; and all the 
teachers in all our public schools are required to pass an examina- 
tion in the elements of agriculture before contracting to teach. 
Scientific gardening and the principles of elementary agriculture 
are a necessary part of the curricula of all our higher educational 
institutions, including our four state normal colleges. 
While gardening is not practicable in our central city schools, 
much interest is taken in flower cluture in little plats that do not 
encroach upon playgrounds, and in window shelves arranged for ° 
favorable flowergrowth. Many of these are extremely beautiful, 
as our coast country affords climatic conditions for perennial 
blooming. 
In our central city school, floriculture is receiving much atten- 
tion, and much effective scientific work is being done in the labora- 
tory study of germination and plant growth. 
This laboratory seed germination and plant growth is conducted 
continuously throughout the school year, in connection with botany 
work. 
In one of the suburban schools of Beaumont, South Park, there 
is a garden or experimental tract of two acres cultivated by the 
boys of the grammar and high school grades under the direction 
of a specialist teacher, whose whole time is devoted to industrial 
work. The boys of this school make a laboratory study of soils 
and plant growth, mix all fertilizers from stock sulphates, phos- 
phates, nitrates, lime, potash and cottonseed meal. These are used 
with sand and silt in proportions fixed by law. Two results are 
thus secured: 
1. Pupils learn the proper proportions of the basal fertilizer 
elements for various soils and for various plants; and 
2. Fertilizers are obtained at minimum cost by the elimination 
of excessive weight in shipment, and of the costless ingredients of 
commercial fertilizers. 
While the vegetables grown on this tract are not placed on the 
market, they are taken to the pupils’ homes, or given to needy fami- 
lies. In addition to the great interest these pupils take in this 
school garden, they have become home gardeners; and parents have 
also become thereby interested in home gardens. 
As garden vegetables are grown in our coast country contipu- 
ously throughout the year, this training is having a practical and 
useful bearing in reducing the cost of living in the community.  
-P-A-G-E-432

This year this school has experimented with milo maize, Jap- 
anese sorghum, ribbon cane, Japanese millet, Spanish peanuts, soy 
beans, cow peas, potatoes, yams, melons, canteloupes, squashes, 
cushaws, cauliflowers, peppers, and most of the common garden 
products, and success has attended all their work. 
They are also growing a small nursery stock and are learning 
much of the science of seedage, of layerage, of cuttage, of buddage, 
and of graftage. 
With a touch of pedantry, these boys justify their claim to being 
students of agriculture, olericulture, floriculture and pomology. 
Anyone not acquainted with our soil and climate possibilities, 
in visiting this and other similar schools of our gulf coast country, 
would be ready to declare that this school garden was under the 
joint solicitous care of the deities—Ceres, Pomona and Vertumnus. 
Tue Best Incentive to Civic Pring. 
MISS NANNIE LEE FRAYSER, LOUISVILLE, KY. 
To‘train a pupil in a sense of civic responsibility we must begin 
with some experience within his immediate reach. Starting with his 
particular desk or table in the school room, inspire him to feel a 
sense of responsibility about keeping his own property neat and the 
floor around his seating place free from litter of any sort. 
Develop this into a sense of responsibility for doing his share in 
order that the whole room shall be kept as attractive as only clean- 
liness and orderliness can keep it. Help him to extend his efforts 
in behalf of some companion who may need his assistance in learn- 
ing lessons of order and neatness. Give him something in the 
school yard to care for. If possible, start a nursery where each 
pupil shall have his own tree. 
Have a school garden where lessons of thrift, reliability and co- 
operation may be taught. Lead him to a sense of appreciation of 
the beauty in simple things and teach him the advantage to a com- 
munity of a trim, well-kept yard with flowers, in every locality 
where space permits of yards. 
Through the cultivation of window box plants lead him to see 
the possibilities in limited surroundings and the beauty to be 
obtained from unpromising conditions. 
Teach him with full explanations the “Athenian Oath,” creating 
opportunities for him to exercise the pledges made therein by stimu- 
lating him to a sense of gratitude for all civic benefits, such as 
parks, playgrounds, swimming pools, libraries, museums, etc.

    JOURNAL OF PROOBEDINGS. 433 
“We will never bring disgrace on this our city by any act of dis- 
honesty or cowardice, nor ever desert our suffering comrades in the 
ranks. We will fight for the ideals and sacred things of our city, 
both alone and with many. We will revere and obey our city’s 
laws and strive to incite a like reverence in those above us who are 
prone to annul and set them at naught. 
“Thus we will, in every way, transmit this our city, not only not 
less, but greater, better and more beautiful than it was transmitted 
to us.” (The Athenian Oath.)

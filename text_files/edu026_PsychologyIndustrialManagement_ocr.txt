  PREFATORY NOTE 
HIS book corresponds to a German’ book, 
which I published a few months ago, under 
the title Psychologie und Wirtschaftsleben: Ein 
Beitrag zur angewandten Experimental-Psychologie 
(Leipzig: J. A. Barth). It is not a translation, 
as some parts of the German volume have been 
abbreviated or entirely omitted and other parts 
have been enlarged and supplemented. Yet the 
essential substance of the two books is identical.

INTRODUCTION

APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY 
UR aim is to sketch the outlines of a new 
science which is to intermediate between 
the modern laboratory psychology and the pro- 
blems of economics: the psychological experiment 
is systematically to be placed at the service of 
commerce and industry. So far we have only 
scattered beginnings of the new doctrine, only 
tentative efforts and disconnected attempts which 
have started, sometimes in economic, and some- 
times in psychological, quarters. The time when 
an exact psychology of business life will be pre- 
sented as a closed and perfected system lies very 
far distant. But the earlier the attention of 
wider circles is directed to its beginnings and to 
the importance and bearings of its tasks, the 
quicker and the more sound will be the develop- 
ment of this young science. What is most needed 
to-day at the beginning of the new movement are 
3

  INTRODUCTION 
clear, concrete illustrations which demonstrate 
the possibilities of the new method. In the follow- 
ing pages, accordingly, it will be my aim to ana- 
lyze the results of experiments which have actu- 
ally been carried out, experiments belonging to 
many different spheres of economic life. But these 
detached experiments ought always at least to 
point to a connected whole; the single experiments 
will, therefore, always need a general discussion 
of the principles as a background. In the interest 
of such a wider perspective we may at first enter 
into some preparatory questions of theory. They 
may serve as an introduction which is to lead 
us to the actual economic life and the present 
achievements of experimental psychology. 
It is well known that the modern psychologists 
only slowly and very reluctantly approached the 
apparently natural task of rendering useful serv- 
ice to practical life. As long as the study of the 
mind was entirely dependent upon philosophical 
or theological speculation, no help could be ex- 
pected from such endeavors to assist in the daily 
walks of life. But half a century has passed since 
the study of consciousness was switched into the 
tracks of exact scientific investigation. Five 
decades ago the psychologists began to devote 
themselves to the most minute description of the 
mental experiences and to explain the mental life 
4
-P-A-G-E-17
  
APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY 
in a way which was modeled after the pattern of 
exact natural sciences. Their aim was no longer 
to speculate about the soul, but to find the psych- 
ical elements and the constant laws which con- 
trol their connections. Psychology became exper- 
imental and physiological. For more than thirty 
years the psychologists have also had their work- 
shops. Laboratories for experimental psychology 
have grown up in all civilized countries, and the 
new method has been applied to one group of 
mental traits after another. And yet we stand be- 
fore the surprising fact that all the manifold results 
of the new science have remained book know- 
ledge, detached from any practical interests. Only 
in the last ten years do we find systematic efforts 
to apply the experimental results of psychology to 
the needs of society. 
It is clear that the reason for this late begin- 
ning is not an unwillingness of the last century to 
make theoretical knowledge serviceable to the de- 
mands of life. Every one knows, on the contrary, 
that the glorious advance of the natural sciences _ 
became at the same time a triumphal march of 
technique. Whatever was brought to light in the 
laboratories of the physicists and chemists, of the 
physiologists and pathologists, was quickly trans- 
formed into achievements of physical and chem- 
ical industry, of medicine and hygiene, of agricul-

  INTRODUCTION 
ture and mining and transportation. No realm 
of the external social life remained untouched. 
The scientists, on the other hand, felt that the 
far-reaching practical effect which came from their 
discoveries exerted a stimulating influence on the 
theoretical researches themselves. The puresearch 
for truth and knowledge was not lowered when 
the electrical waves were harnessed for wireless 
telegraphy, or the Roentgen rays were forced into 
the service of surgery. The knowledge of nature 
and the mastery of nature have always belonged 
together. 
The persistent hesitation of the psychologists 
to make similar practical use of their experimental 
results has therefore come from different causes. 
The students of mental life evidently had the feel- 
ing that quiet, undisturbed research was needed 
for the new science of psychology in order that a 
certain maturity might be reached before acontact 
with the turmoil of practical life would be advis- 
able. The sciences themselves cannot escape in- 
jury if their results are forced into the rush of the 
day before the fundamental ideas have been 
cleared up, the methods of investigation really 
tried, and an ample supply of facts collected. But 
this very justified reluctance becomes a real dan- 
ger if it grows into an instinctive fear of coming 
into contact at all with practical life. To be sure, 
6
-P-A-G-E-19
  APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY 
in any single case there may be a difference of 
opinion as to when the right time has come and 
when the inner consolidation of a new science is 
sufficiently advanced for the technical service, 
but it ought to be clear that it is not wise to wait 
until the scientists have settled all the theoretical 
problems involved. True progress in every scien- 
tific field means that the problems become mul- 
tiplied and that ever new questions keep coming 
to the surface. If the psychologists were to refrain 
from practical application until the theoretical 
results of their laboratories need no supplement, 
the time for applied psychology would never come. 
Whoever looks without prejudice on the develop- 
ment of modern psychology ought to acknowledge 
that the hesitancy which was justified in the be- 
ginning would to-day be inexcusable lack of initi- 
ative. For the sciences of the mind, too, the time 
has come when theory and practice must support 
each other. An exceedingly large mass of facts 
has been gathered, the methods have become re- 
fined and differentiated, and however much may 
still be under discussion, the ground common to all 
is ample enough to build upon. 
Another important reason for the slowness of 
practical progress was probably this. When the 
psychologists began to work with the new experi- 
mental methods, their most immediate concern 
7
-P-A-G-E-20
  INTRODUCTION 
was to get rid of mere speculation and to take 
hold of actual facts. Hence they regarded the 
natural sciences as their model, and, together 
with the experimental method which distinguishes 
scientific work, the characteristic goal of the 
sciences was accepted too. This scientific goal 
is always the attainment of general laws; and so 
it happened that in the first decades after the 
foundation of psychological laboratories the gen- 
eral laws of the mind absorbed the entire atten- 
tion and interest of the investigators. The result 
of such an attitude was, that we learned to under- 
stand the working of the typical mind, but that 
all the individual variations were almost neg- 
lected. When the various individuals differed in 
their mental behavior, these differences appeared 
almost as disturbances which the psychologists 
had to eliminate in order to find the general laws 
which hold for every mind. The studies were ac- 
cordingly confined to the general averages of 
mental experience, while the variations from such 
averages were hardly included in the scientific ac- 
count. In earlier centuries, to be sure, the interest 
of the psychological observers had been given al- 
most entirely to the rich manifoldness of human 
characters and intelligences and talents. In the 
new period of experimental work, this interest was 
taken as an indication of the unscientific fancies 
8
-P-A-G-E-21
  
APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY 
of the earlier age, in which the curious and the 
anecdotal attracted the view. The new science 
which was to seek the laws was to overcome such 
popular curiosity. In this sign experimental psy- 
chology has conquered. The fundamental laws 
of the ideas and of the attention, of the memory 
and of the will, of the feeling and of the emotions, 
have been elaborated. Yet it slowly became evi- 
dent that'such one-sidedness, however necessary it 
may have been at the beginning, would make any 
practical application impossible. In practical life 
we never have to do with what is common to all 
human beings, even when we are to influence 
large masses; we have to deal with personalities 
whose mental life is characterized by particular 
traits of nationality, or race, or vocation, or sex, 
or age, or special interests, or other features by 
which they differ from the average mind which 
the theoretical psychologist may construct as a 
type. Still more frequently we have to act with 
reference to smaller groups or to single individ- 
uals whose mental physiognomy demands care- 
ful consideration. As long as experimental psy- 
chology remained essentially a science of the 
mental laws, common to all human beings, an ad- 
justment to the practical demands of daily life 
could hardly come in question. With such gen- 
eral laws we could never have mastered the con- 
9

INTRODUCTION 
crete situations of society, because we should have 
had to leave out of view the fact that there are 
gifted and ungifted, intelligent and stupid, sensi- 
tive and obtuse, quick and slow, energetic and 
weak individuals. 
But in recent years a complete change can be 
traced in our science. Experiments which refer 
to these individual differences themselves have 
been carried on by means of the psychological 
laboratory, at first reluctantly and in tentative 
forms, but within the last ten years the move- 
ment has made rapid progress. To-day we have a 
psychology of individual variations from the point 
of view of the psychological laboratory. This 
development of schemes to compare the differ- 
ences between the individuals by the methods of 
experimental science was after all the most im- 
portant advance toward the practical application 
of psychology. The study of the individual dif- 
ferences itself is not applied psychology, but it 
is the presupposition without which applied psy- 
chology would have remained a phantom.

THE DEMANDS OF PRACTICAL LIFE 
_ in this way the progress of psy- 
chology itself and the development of 
the psychology of individual differences favored 
the growth of applied psychology, there arose 
at the same time an increasing demand in the 
* midst of practical life. Especially the teachers and 
the physicians, later the lawyers as well, looked 
for help from exact psychology. The science of 
education and instruction had always had some 
contact with the science of the mind, as the peda- 
gogues could never forget that the mental devel- 
opment of the child has to stand in the centre 
of educational thought. For a long while peda- 
gogy was still leaning on a philosophical psycho- 
logy, after that old-fashioned study of the soul had 
been given up in psychological quarters. At last, 
in the days of progressive experimental psycho- 
logy, the time came when the teachers under the 
pressure of their new needs began to inquire how 
far the modern laboratory could aid them in the 
classroom. The pedagogical psychology of mem- 
ory, of attention, of will, and of intellect was 
systematically worked up by men with practical 
11

INTRODUCTION 
school interests. We may notice in the move- 
ment a slow but most important shifting. At first 
the results of theoretical psychology were simply 
transplanted into the pedagogical field. Experi- 
ments which were carried on in the interest of 
pure theoretical science were made practical use 
of, but their application remained a mere chance 
by-product. Only slowly did the pedagogical 
problems themselves begin to determine the ex- 
perimental investigation. The methods of labora- 
tory psychology were applied for the solving of 
those problems which originated in the school ex- 
perience, and only when this point was reached 
could a truly experimental pedagogy be built ona 
psychological foundation. We stand in the midst 
of this vigorous and healthy movement, which 
has had a stimulating effect on theoretical psy- 
chology itself. 
We find a similar situation in the sphere of the 
physician. He could not pass by the new’science 
of the mind without instinctively feeling that his 
medical diagnosis and therapy could be furthered 
in many directions by the experimental method. 
Not only the psychiatrist and nerve specialist, 
but in a certain sense every physician had made 
use of a certain amount of psychology in his pro- 
fessional work. He had always had to make clear 
to himself the mental experiences of the patient, 
12    
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE DEMANDS OF PRACTICAL LIFE 
to study his pain sensations and his feelings of 
comfort, his fears and his hopes, his perceptions 
and his volitions, and to a certain degree he had 
always tried to influence the mental life of the 
patient, to work on him by suggestion and to help 
him by stimulating his mind. But as far as a real 
description and explanation of such mental ex- 
periences came in question, all remained a dilet- 
tantic semi-psychology which worked with the 
most trivial conceptions of popular thinking. The 
medical men recognized the disproportion be- 
tween the exactitude of their anatomical, physi- 
ological, and pathological observation and the 
superficiality of their self-made psychology. Thus 
the desire arose in their own medical circle to 
harmonize their psychological means of diagnosis 
and therapy with the schemes of modern scien- 
tific psychology. The physician who examines the 
sensations in a nervous disease, or the intelligence 
in a mental disease, or heals by suggestion or 
hypnotism, tries to apply the latest discoveries 
of the psychological laboratory. But here, too, 
the same development as in pedagogy can be 
traced. The physicians at first made use only of 
results which had been secured under entirely dif- 
ferent points of view, but later the experiments 
were subordinated to the special medical problems. 
Then the physician was no longer obliged simply 
13
-P-A-G-E-26
ee ee re ee ee ee ere et Meee ce es 
INTRODUCTION 
to use what he happened to find among the re- 
sults of the theoretical psychologist, but carried 
on the experiments in the service of medical pro- 
blems. The independent status of experimental 
medical psychology could be secured only by this 
development. 
In somewhat narrower limits the same may 
be said as to the problems of law. Akind of popu- 
lar psychology was naturally involved whenever 
judges or lawyers analyzed the experience on the 
witness stand or discussed the motives of crime 
or the confessions of the criminal or the social 
conditions of criminality. But when every day 
brought new discoveries in the psychological lab- 
oratory, it seemed natural to make use of the new 
methods and of the new results in the interest of 
the courtroom. The power of observation in the 
witness, the exactitude of his memory, the char- 
acter of his illusions and imagination, his suggest- 
ibility and his feeling, appeared in a new light in 
view of the experimental investigations, and the 
emotions and volitions of the criminal were under- 
stood with a new insight. Here, too, the last step 
was taken. Instead of being satisfied with experi- 
ments which the psychologist had made for his 
own purposes, the students of legal psychology 
adjusted experiments to the particular needs of 
the courtroom. Investigations were carried on to 
14  
-P-A-G-E-27
  
THE DEMANDS OF PRACTICAL LIFE 
determine the fidelity of testimony or tofind meth- 
ods for the detection of hidden thoughts and so on. 
Efforts toward the application of psychology have 
accordingly grown up in the fields of pedagogy, 
medicine, and jurisprudence, but as these studies 
naturally do not remain independent of one an- 
other, they all together form the one unified sci- 
ence of applied psychology.? 
As soon as the independence of this new science 
was felt, it was natural that new demands and new 
problems should continue to originate within its 
own limits. There must be applied psychology 
wherever the investigation of mental life can be 
madeserviceableto the tasks of civilization. Crim- 
inal law, education, medicine, certainly donot con- 
stitute the totality of civilized life. It is therefore 
the duty of the practical psychologist systemat- 
ically to examine how far other purposes of mod- 
ern society can be advanced by the new methods 
of experimental psychology. There is, for in- 
stance, already far-reaching agreement that the 
problems of artistic creation, of scientific obser- 
vation, of social reform, and many similar en- 
deavors must be acknowledged as organic parts 
of applied psychology. Only one group of pur- 
poses is so far surprisingly neglected in the realm 
of the psychological laboratory: the purposes of 
the economic life, the purposes of commerce and 
15
-P-A-G-E-28
  INTRODUCTION 
industry, of business and the market in the widest 
sense of the word. The question how far applied 
psychology can be extended in this direction is the 
topic of the following discussions.

MEANS AND ENDS 
PPLIED psychology is evidently to be 
classed with the technical sciences. It may 
be considered as psychotechnics, since we must 
recognize any science as technical if it teaches us 
to apply theoretical knowledge for the further- 
ance of human purposes. Like all technical 
sciences, applied psychology tells us what we 
ought to do if we want to reach certain ends; but 
we ought to realize at the threshold where the 
limits of such a technical science lie, as they are 
easily overlooked, with resulting confusion. We 
must understand that every technical science 
says only: you must make use of this means, if 
you wish to reach this or that particular end. But 
no technical science can decide within its limits 
whether the end itself is really a desirable one. 
The technical specialist knows how he ought to 
build a bridge or how he ought to pierce a tunnel, 
presupposing that the bridge or the tunnel is de- 
sired. But whether they are desirable or not is a 
question which does not concern the technical 
scientist, but which must be considered from 
17  
-P-A-G-E-30
INTRODUCTION 
economic or political or other points of view. 
Everywhere the engineer must know how to reach 
an end, and must leave it to others to settle 
whether the end is in itself desirable. Often the 
end may be a matter of course for every reason- 
able being. The extreme case is presented by the 
applied science of medicine, where the physician 
subordinates all his technique to the end of curing 
the patient. Yet if we are consistent we must ac- 
knowledge that all his medical knowledge can 
prescribe to him only that he proceed in a certain 
way if the long life of the patient is acknowledged 
as a desirable end. The application of anatomy, 
physiology, and pathology may just as well be used 
for the opposite end of killing a man. Whether 
it is wise to work toward long life, or whether it 
is better to kill people, is again a problem which 
lies outside the sphere of the applied sciences. 
Ethics or social philosophy or religion have to 
solve these preliminary questions. The physician 
as such has only to deal with the means which lead 
toward that goal. 
We must make the same discrimination in 
the psychotechnical field. The psychologist may 
point out the methods by which an involuntary 
confession can be secured from a defendant, but 
whether it is justifiable to extort involuntary 
confessions is a problem which does not concern 
18

         MEANS AND ENDS 
the psychologist. The lawyers or the legislators 
must decide as to the right or wrong, the legality 
or illegality, of forcing a man to show his hidden 
ideas. If such an end is desirable, the psycho- 
technical student can determine the right means, 
and that is the limit of his office. We ought to 
keep in mind that the same holds true for the 
application of psychology in economic life. Eco- 
nomic psychotechnics may serve certain ends of 
commerce and industry, but whether these ends 
are the best ones is not a care with which the 
psychologist has to be burdened. For instance, the 
end may be the selection of the most efficient la- 
borers for particular industries. The psychologist 
may develop methods in his laboratory by which 
this purpose can be fulfilled. But if some mills 
prefer another goal, —for instance, to have not the 
most efficient but the cheapest possible laborers, 
—entirely different means for the selection are 
necessary. The psychologist is, therefore, not en- 
tangled in the economic discussions of the day; it 
is not his concern to decide whether the policy 
of the trusts or the policy of the trade-unions or 
any other policy for the selection of laborers is 
the ideal one. He is confined to the statement: 
if you wish this end, then you must proceed in 
this way; but it is left to you to express your pre- 
ference among the ends. Applied psychology can, 
19
-P-A-G-E-32
i a gu hm i i a 
INTRODUCTION 
therefore, speak the language of an exact science 
in its own field, independent of economic opinions 
and debatable partisan interests. This is a neces- 
sary limitation, but in this limitation lies the | 
strength of the new science. The psychologist 
may show how a special commodity can be adver- 
tised; but whether from a social point of view it is 
desirable to reinforce the sale of these goods is no 
problem for psychotechnics. If a sociologist in- 
sists that it would be better if not so many useless 
goods were bought, and that the aim ought rather 
to be to protect the buyer than to help the seller, 
the psychologist would not object. His interest 
would only be to find the right psychological 
means to lead to this other social end. He is par- 
tisan neither of the salesman nor of the customer, 
neither of the capitalist nor of the laborer, he is 
neither Socialist nor anti-Socialist, neither high- 
tariff man nor free-trader. Here, too, of course, 
there are certain goals which are acknowledged on 
all sides, and which therefore hardly need any 
discussion, just as in the case of the physician, 
where the prolongation of life is practically ac- 
knowledged as a desirable end by every one. But 
everywhere where the aim is not perfectly a mat- 
ter of course, the psychotechnical specialist fulfills 
his task only when he is satisfied with demon- 
strating that certain psychical means serve a cer- 
20 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  
  MEANS AND ENDS 
tain end, and that they ought to be applied as 
soon as that end is accepted. 
The whole system of psychotechnical knowledge 
might be subdivided under either of the two as- 
pects. Either we might start from the various 
mental processes and ask for what end each men- 
tal factor can be practically useful and important, 
or we can begin with studying what significant 
ends are acknowledged in our society and then 
we can seek the various psychological facts which 
are needed as means for the realization of these 
ends. The first way offers many conveniences. 
There we should begin with the mental states of 
attention, memory, feeling, and so on, and should 
study how the psychological knowledge of every 
one of these mental states can render service in 
many different practical fields. The attention, 
for instance, is important in the classroom when 
the teacher tries to secure the attention of the pu- 
pils, but the judge expects the same attention from 
the jurymen in the courtroom, the artist seeks to 
stir up the attention of the spectator, the adver- 
tiser demands the attention of the newspaper 
readers. Whoever studies the characteristics of 
the mental process of attention may then be able 
to indicate how in every one of these unlike cases 
the attention can be stimulated and retained. 
Nevertheless the opposite way which starts from 
21
-P-A-G-E-34
  
  INTRODUCTION 
the tasks to be fulfilled seems more helpful and 
more fundamentally significant. The question, 
then, is what mental processes become important 
for the tasks of education, what for the purposes 
of the courtroom, what for the hospital, what for 
the church, what for politics, and so on. 
As this whole essay is to be devoted exclusively 
to the economic problems, we are obliged to 
choose the second way; that is, to arrange applied 
psychology with reference to its chief ends and 
not with reference to the various means. But the 
same question comes up in the further subdivision 
of the material. In the field of economic psycho- 
logy, too, we might ask how far the study of at- 
tention, or of perception, or of feeling, or of will, 
or of memory, and so on, can be useful for the pur- 
poses of the business man. Or here, too, we might 
begin with the consideration of the various ends 
and purposes. The ends of commerce are differ- 
ent from those of industry, those of publishing 
different from those of transportation, those of 
agriculture different from those of mining; or, in 
the field of commerce, the purposes of the retailer 
are different from those of the wholesale merchant. 
There can be no limit to such subdivisions; each 
particular industry has its own aims, and in the 
same industry a large variety of tasks are united. 
We should accordingly be led to an ample classi- 
22
-P-A-G-E-35
  MEANS AND ENDS 
fication of special economic ends with pigeonholes 
for every possible kind of business and of labor. 
The psychologist would have to find for every one 
of these ends the right mental means. This would 
be the ideal system of economic psychology. 
But we are still endlessly far from such a per- 
fect system. Modern educational psychology and 
medical psychology have reached a stage at which 
an effort for such a complete system might be 
realized, but economic psychology is still at too 
early a stage of development. It would be entirely 
artificial to-day to aim at such ideal completeness. 
If we were to construct such a complete system 
of questions, we should have no answers. In the 
present stage nothing can be seriously proposed 
but the selection of a few central purposes which 
occur in every department of business life, and a 
study of the means to reach these special ends by 
the discussion of some typical cases which may 
clearly illustrate the methods involved. 
From this point of view we select three chief 
purposes of business life, purposes which are im- 
portant in commerce and industry and every eco- 
nomic endeavor. We ask how we can find the 
men whose mental qualities make them best fit- 
ted for the work which they have to do; secondly, 
under what psychological conditions we can se- 
cure the greatest and most satisfactory output

of work from every man; and finally, how we can 
produce most completely the influences on human 
minds which are desired in the interest of business. 
In other words, we ask how to find the best possi- 
ble man, how to produce the best possible work, 
and how to secure the best possible effects.

NSTEAD of lingering over theoretical discus- 
sions, we will move straight on toward our first 
practical problem. The economic task, with re- 
ference to which we want to demonstrate the new 
psychotechnic method, is the selection of those 
personalities which by their mental qualities are 
especially fit for a particular kind of economic 
work. This problem is especially useful to show 
what the new method can do and what it cannot 
do. Whether the method is sufficiently developed 
to secure full results to-day, or whether they will 
come to-morrow, is unimportant. It is clear that 
the success of to-morrow is to be hoped for, only 
if understanding and interest in the problem is 
already alive to-day. 
When we inquire into the qualities of men, we 
use the word here in its widest meaning. It covers, 
on the one side, the mental dispositions which may 
still be quite undeveloped and which may unfold 
Q7   
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
only under the influence of special conditions in 
the surroundings; but, on the other side, it covers 
the habitual traits of the personality, the features 
of the individual temperament and character, of 
the intelligence and of the ability, of the collected 
knowledge and of the acquired experience. All 
variations of will and feeling, of perception and 
thought, of attention and emotion, of memory 
and imagination, are included here. From a 
purely psychological standpoint, quite incompar- 
able contents and functions and dispositions of 
the personality are thus thrown together, but in 
practical life we are accustomed to proceed after 
this fashion: If a man applies for a position, he is 
considered with regard to the totality of his qual- 
ities, and at first nobody cares whether the par- 
ticular feature is inherited or acquired, whether it 
is an individual chance variation or whether it is 
common to a larger group, perhaps to all mem- 
bers of a certain nationality or race. We simply 
start from the clear fact that the personalities 
which enter into the world of affairs present an 
unlimited manifoldness of talents and abilities and 
functions of the mind. From this manifoldness, 
it necessarily follows that some are more, some 
less, fit for the particular economic task. In view 
of the far-reaching division of labor in our modern 
economic life, it is impossible to avoid the ques- 
28  
-P-A-G-E-41
  
VOCATION: AND FITNESS 
tion how we can select the fit personalities and re- 
ject the unfit ones. 
How has modern society prepared itself to 
settle this social demand? In case that certain 
knowledge is indispensable for the work or that 
technical abilities must have been acquired, the 
vocation is surrounded by examinations. This is 
true of the lower as well as of the higher activ- 
ities. The direct examination is everywhere sup- 
plemented by testimonials covering the previous 
achievements, by certificates referring to the 
previous education, and in frequent cases by the 
endeavor to gain a personal impression from 
the applicant. But if we take all this together, 
the total result remains a social machinery by 
which perhaps the elimination of the entirely un- 
fit can be secured. But no one could speak of a 
really satisfactory adaptation of the manifold per- 
sonalities to the economic vocational tasks. All 
those examinations and tests and certificates re- 
fer essentially to what can be learned from with- 
out, and not to the true qualities of the mind and 
the deeper traits. The so-called impressions, too, 
are determined by the most secondary and exter- 
nal factors. Society relies instinctively on the hope 
that the natural wishes and interests will push 
every one to the place for which his dispositions, 
talents, and psychophysical gifts prepare him. 
29 
   
-P-A-G-E-42
   
    THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
In reality this confidence is entirely unfounded. 
A threefold difficulty exists. In the first place, 
young people know very little about themselves 
and their abilities. When the day comes on which 
they discover their real strong points and their 
weaknesses, it is often too late. They have usually 
been drawn into the current of a particular voca- 
tion, and have given too much energy to the 
preparation for a specific achievement to change 
the whole life-plan once more. The entire scheme 
of education gives to the individual little chance 
to find himself. A mere interest for one or another 
subject in school is influenced by many accidental 
circumstances, by the personality of the teacher 
or the methods of instruction, by suggestions of 
the surroundings and by home traditions, and 
accordingly even such a preference gives rather a 
slight final indication of the individual mental 
qualities. Moreover, such mere inclinations and 
interests cannot determine the true psychological 
fitness for a vocation. To choose a crude illustra- 
tion, a boy may think with passion of the vocation 
of a sailor, and yet may be entirely unfit for it, 
because his mind lacks the ability to discriminate 
red and green. He himself may never have dis- 
covered that he is color-blind, but when he is 
ready to turn to the sailor’s calling, the examina- 
tion of his color-sensitiveness which is demanded 
30 
   
-P-A-G-E-43
VOCATION AND FITNESS 
may have shown the disturbing mental defi- 
ciency. Similar defects may exist in a boy’s atten- 
tion or memory, judgment or feeling, thought or 
imagination, suggestibility or emotion, and they 
may remain just as undiscovered as the defect 
of color-blindness, which is characteristic of four 
per cent of the male population. All such defi- 
ciencies may be dangerous in particular callings. 
But while the vocation of the ship officer is for- 
tunately protected nowadays by such a special 
psychological examination, most other vocations 
“are unguarded against the entrance of the men- 
tally unfit individuals.— 
As the boys and girls grow up without recog- 
nizing their psychical weaknesses, the exceptional 
strength of one or another mental function too 
often remains unnoticed by them as well. They 
may find out when they are favored with a special 
talent for art or music or scholarship, but they 
hardly ever know that their attention, or their 
memory, or their will, or their intellectual appre- 
hension, or their sensory perceptions, are unusu- 
ally developed in a particular direction; yet such 
an exceptional mental disposition might be the 
cause of special success in certain vocations. But 
we may abstract from the extremes of abnormal 
deficiency and abnormal overdevelopment in 
particular functions. Between them we find the 
31 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
broad region of the average minds with their num- 
berless variations, and these variations are usually 
quite unknown to their possessors. It is often 
surprising to see how the most manifest differ- 
ences of psychical organization remain unnoticed 
by the individuals themselves. Men with a pro- 
nounced visual type of memory and men with a 
marked acoustical type may live together without 
the slightest idea that their contents of conscious- 
ness are fundamentally different from each other. 
Neither the children nor their parents nor their 
teachers burden themselves with the careful 
analysis of such actual mental qualities when the 
choice of a vocation is before them. They know 
that a boy who is completely unmusical must not 
become a musician, and that the child who cannot 
draw at all must not become a painter, just as on 
physical grounds a boy with very weak muscles 
is not fit to become a blacksmith. But as soon 
as the subtler differentiation is needed, the judg- 
ment of all concerned seems helpless and the 
psychical characteristics remain disregarded. 
A further reason for the lack of adaptation, and 
surely a most important one, lies in the fact that 
the individual usually knows only the most ex- 
ternal conditions of the vocations from which he 
chooses. The most essential requisite for a truly 
perfect adaptation, namely, a real analysis of the 
32
-P-A-G-E-45
  VOCATION AND FITNESS 
vocational demands with reference to the desir- 
able personal qualities, is so far not in existence. 
The young people generally see some superficial 
traits of the careers which seem to stand open, 
and, besides, perhaps they notice the great re- 
wards of the most successful. The inner labor, the 
inner values, and the inner difficulties and frictions 
are too often unknown to those who decide for a 
vocation, and they are unable to correlate those 
essential factors of the life-calling with all that 
nature by inheritance, and society by surround- 
ings and training, have planted and developed in 
their minds. 
In addition to this ignorance as to one’s own 
mental disposition and to the lack of understand- 
ing of the true mental requirements of the vari- 
ous social tasks comes finally the abundance of 
trivial chance influences which become decisive in 
the choice of a vocation. Vocation and marriage 
are the two most consequential decisions in life. 
In the selection of a husband or wife, too, the de- 
cision is very frequently made dependent upon 
the most superficial and trivial motives. Yet the 
social philosopher may content himself with the 
belief that even in the fugitive love desire a deeper 
instinct of nature is expressed, which may at least 
serve the biological tasks of married life. In the 
choice of a vocation, even such a belief in a bio- 
33 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
ia a a a i i a 
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
logical instinct is impossible. The choice of a vo- 
cation, determined by fugitive whims and chance 
fancies, by mere imitation, by a hope for quick 
earnings, by irresponsible recommendation, or by 
mere laziness, has no internal reason or excuse. 
Illusory ideas as to the prospects of a career, 
moreover, often falsify the whole vista; and if we 
consider all this, we can hardly be surprised that 
our total result is in many respects hardly better 
than if everything were left entirely to accident. 
Even on the height of a mental training to the 
end of adolescence, we see how the college grad- 
uates are too often led by accidental motives to 
the decision whether they shall become lawyers or 
physicians or business men, but this superficiality 
of choice of course appears much more strongly 
where the lifework is to be built upon the basis 
of a mere elementary or high school education. 
The final result corresponds exactly to these 
conditions. Everywhere, in all countries and in 
all vocations, but especially in the economic ca- 
reers, we hear the complaint that there is lack of 
really good men. Everywhere places are waiting 
for the right man, while at the same time we find 
everywhere an oversupply of mediocre aspirants. 
This, however, does not in the least imply that 
there really are not enough personalities who might 
be perfectly fit even for the highest demands of 
34
-P-A-G-E-47
    
VOCATION AND FITNESS 
the vocations; it means only that as a matter of 
course the result in the filling of positions cannot 
be satisfactory, if the placing of the individuals is 
carried on without serious regard for the personal 
mental qualities. The complaint that there is 
lack of fit human material would probably never 
entirely disappear, as with a better adjustment 
of the material, the demands would steadily in- 
crease; but it could at least be predicted with high 
probability that this lack of really fit material 
would not be felt so keenly everywhere if the 
really decisive factor for the adjustment of per- 
sonality and vocation, namely, the dispositions of 
the mind, were not so carelessly ignored. 
Society, to be sure, has a convenient means of 
correction. The individual tries, and when he is 
doing his work too badly, he loses his job, he is 
pushed out from the career which he has chosen, 
with the great probability that he will be crushed 
by the wheels of social life. It is a rare occurrence 
for the man who is a failure in his chosen voca- 
tion, and who has been thrown out of it, to happen 
to come into the career in which he can make a 
success. Social statistics show with an appalling 
clearness what a burden and what a danger to the 
social body is growing from the masses of those 
who do not succeed and who by their lack of suc- 
cess become discouraged and embittered. The 
85 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
     
    THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
social psychologist cannot resist the conviction 
that every single one could have found a place in 
which he could have achieved something of value 
for the commonwealth. The laborer, who in spite 
of his best efforts shows himself useless and clumsy 
before one machine, might perhaps have done satis- 
factory work in the next mill where the machines 
demand another type of mental reaction. His 
psychical rhythm and his inner functions would 
be able to adjust themselves to the requirements 
of the one kind of labor and not to those of the 
other. Truly the whole social body has had to pay 
a heavy penalty for not making even the faintest 
effort to settle systematically the fundamental 
problem of vocational choice, the problem of the 
psychical adaptation of the individuality. An 
improvement would lie equally in the interest of 
those who seek positions and those who have posi- 
tions to offer. The employers can hope that in all 
departments better work will be done as soon as 
better adapted individuals can be obtained; and, 
on the other hand, those who are anxious to make 
their working energies effective may expect that 
the careful selection of individual mental char- 
acters for the various tasks of the world will in- 
sure not only greater success and gain, but above 
all greater joy in the work, deeper satisfaction, and 
more harmonious unfolding of the personality.

BSERVATIONS of this kind, which refer 
to the borderland region between psycho- 
logy and social politics, are valid for all modern 
nations. Yet it is hardly a chance that the first 
efforts toward a systematic overcoming of some 
of these difficulties have been made with us in 
America. The barriers between the classes lie 
lower; here the choice of a vocation is less deter- 
mined by tradition; and it belongs to the creed 
of political democracy that just as everybody can 
be called to the highest elective offices, so every- 
body ought to be fit for any vocation in any 
sphere of life. The wandering from calling to 
calling is more frequent in America than anywhere 
else. To be sure, this has the advantage that a 
failure in one vocation does not bring with it such 
a serious injury as in Europe, but it contributes 
much to the greater danger that any one may 
jump recklessly and without preparation into 
any vocational stream. 
It is fresh in every one’s mind how during the 
last decade the economic conscience of the whole 
American nation became aroused. Up to the end 
37
-P-A-G-E-50
  
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
of the last century the people had lived with the 
secure feeling of possessing a country with inex- 
haustible treasures. The last few years brought 
the reaction, and it became increasingly clear how 
irresponsible the national attitude had been, how 
the richness of the forests and the mines and the 
rivers had been recklessly squandered without 
any thought of the future. Conservation of the 
national possessions suddenly became the battle- 
cry, and this turned the eye also to that limitless 
waste of human material, a waste going on 
everywhere in the world, but nowhere more 
widely than in the United States. The feeling 
grew that no waste of valuable possessions is so 
reckless as that which results from the distrib- 
uting of living force by chance methods instead 
of examining carefully how work and workmen 
can fit one another. While this was the emotional 
background, two significant social movements 
originated in our midst. The two movements were 
entirely independent of each other, but from 
two different starting-points they worked in one 
respect toward the same goal. They are social 
and economic movements, neither of which at 
first had anything directly to do with psycholog- 
ical questions; but both led to a point where the 
psychological turn of the problem seemed un- 
avoidable. Here begins the obligation of the psy- 
38
-P-A-G-E-51
  SCIENTIFIC VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
chologist, and the possibility of fulfilling this 
obligation will be the topic of our discussion con- 
cerning the selection of the best man. 
These two American movements which we have 
in mind are the effort to furnish to pupils leav- 
ing the school guidance in their choice of a voca- 
tion, and the nowadays still better known move- 
ment toward scientific management in commerce 
and industry. The movement toward vocational 
guidance is externally still rather modest and 
confined to very narrow circles, but it is rapidly 
spreading and is not without significant achieve- 
ments. It started in Boston. There the late Mr. 
Parsons once called a meeting of all the boys of 
his neighborhood who were to leave the element- 
ary schools at the end of the year. He wanted to 
consider with them whether they had reasonable 
plans for their future. At the well-attended meet- 
ing it became clear that the boys knew little con- 
cerning what they had to expect in practical life, 
and Parsons was able to give them, especially in 
individual discussions, much helpful informa- 
tion. They knew too little of the characteristic 
features of the vocations to which they wanted to 
devote themselves, and they had given hardly 
any attention to the question whether they had 
the necessary qualifications for the special work. 
From this germ grew a little office which was 
39
-P-A-G-E-52
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
opened in 1908, in which all Boston boys and girls 
at the time when they left school were to receive 
individual suggestions with reference to the most 
reasonable and best adjusted selection of a calling. 
There is hardly any doubt that the remarkable 
success of this modest beginning was dependent 
upon the admirable personality of the late or- 
ganizer, who recognized the individual features 
with unusual tact and acumen. But he himself 
had no doubt that such a merely impressionistic 
method could not satisfy the demands. He saw 
that a threefold advance would become necessary. 
First, it was essential to analyze the objective 
relations of the many hundred kinds of accessible 
vocations. Their economic, hygienic, technical, 
and social elements ought to be examined so that 
every boy and girl could receive reliable informa- 
tion as to the demands of the vocation and as to 
the prospects and opportunities in it. Secondly, 
it would become essential to interest the schools 
in all these complex questions of vocational 
choice, so that, by observation of individual tend- 
encies and abilities of the pupils, the teachers 
might furnish preparatory material for the work 
of the institute for vocational guidance. Thirdly, 
— and this is for us the most important point, — 
he saw that the methods had to be elaborated in 
such a way that the personal traits and disposi- 
40
-P-A-G-E-53
  
SCIENTIFIC VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
tions might be discovered with much greater 
exactitude and with much richer detail than was 
possible through what a mere call on the voca- 
tional counselor could unveil.® 
It is well known how this Boston bureau has 
stimulated a number of American cities to come 
forward with similar beginnings. The pedagog- 
ical circles have been especially aroused by the 
movement, municipal and philanthropic boards 
have at least approached this group of problems, 
two important conferences for vocational guid- 
ance have met in New York, and at various 
places the question has been discussed whether 
or not a vocational counselor might be attached 
to the schools in a position similar to that of the 
school physician. The chief progress has been 
made in the direction of collecting reliable data 
with reference to the economic and hygienic con- 
ditions of the various vocations, the demand and 
supply and the scale of wages. In short, everything 
connected with the externalities of the vocations 
has been carefully analyzed, and sufficient reliable 
material has been gained, at least regarding cer- 
tain local conditions. In the place of individual 
advice, we have thus to a certain degree obtained 
general economic investigations from which each 
can gather what he needs. It seems that some- 
times the danger of letting such offices degenerate 
41  
-P-A-G-E-54
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
into mere agencies for employment has not been 
avoided, but that is one of the perils of the first 
development. The mother institute in Boston, 
too, under its new direction emphasizes more the 
economic and hygienic side, and has set its centre 
of gravity in a systematic effort to propagate un- 
derstanding of the problems of vocational guid- 
ance and to train professional vocational counsel- 
ors in systematic courses, who are then to carry 
the interest over the land.* 
The real psychological analysis with which the 
movement began has, therefore, been somewhat 
pushed aside for a while, and the officers of those 
institutes declare frankly that they want to return 
to the mental problem only after professional psy- 
chologists have sufficiently worked out the specific 
methods for its mastery. Most counselors seem to 
feel instinctively that the core of the whole matter 
lies in the psychological examination, but they 
all agree that for this they must wait until the 
psychological laboratories can furnish them with 
really reliable means and schemes. Certainly it 
is very important, for instance, that boys with 
weak lungs be kept away from such industrial vo- 
cations as have been shown by the statistics to be 
dangerous for the lungs, or that the onrush to 
vocations be stopped where the statistics allow it 
to be foreseen that there will soon be an over- 
42
-P-A-G-E-55
SCIENTIFIC VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
supply of workers. But, after all, it remains 
much more decisive for the welfare of the com- 
munity, and for the future life happiness of those 
who leave the school, that every one turn to those 
forms of work to which his psychological traits 
are adjusted, or at least that he be kept away from 
those in which his mental qualities and disposi- 
tions would make a truly successful advance 
improbable. 
The problem accordingly has been handed over 
from the vocational counselors to the experimen- 
tal psychologists, and it is certainly in the spirit 
of the modern tendency toward applied psychol- 
ogy that the psychological laboratories undertake 
the investigation and withdraw it from the dilet- 
tantic discussion of amateur psychologists or the 
mere impressionism of the school-teachers. Even 
those early beginnings indicate clearly that the 
goal can be reached only through exact, scientific, 
experimental research, and that the mere naive 
methods — for instance, the filling-out of ques- 
tionnaires which may be quite useful in the first 
approach — cannot be sufficient for a real, per- 
sistent furtherance of economic life and of the 
masses who seek their vocations. In order to 
gain an analysis of the individual, Parsons made 
every applicant answer in writing a long series of 
questions which referred to his habits and his 
43  
-P-A-G-E-56
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
emotions, his inclinations and his expectations, his 
traits and his experiences. The psychologist, how- 
ever, can hardly be in doubt that just the mental 
qualities which ought to be most important for 
the vocational counselor can scarcely be found out 
by such methods. We have emphasized before 
that the ordinary individual knows very little of 
his own mental functions: on the whole, he knows 
them as little as he knows the muscles which he 
uses when he talks or walks. Among his ques- 
tions Parsons included such ones as: “‘Are your 
manners quiet, noisy, boisterous, deferential, or 
self-assertive? Are you thoughtful of the comfort 
of others? Do you smile naturally and easily, 
or is your face ordinarily expressionless? Are you 
frank, kindly, cordial, respectful, courteous in 
word and actions? Do you look people frankly 
in the eye? Are your inflections natural, cour- 
teous, modest, musical, or aggressive, conceited, 
pessimistic, repellent? What are your powers 
of attention, observation, memory, reason, imag- 
ination, inventiveness, thoughtfulness, receptive- 
ness, quickness, analytical power, constructive- 
ness, breadth, grasp? Can you manage people 
well? Do you know a fine picture when you see 
it? Is your will weak, yielding, vacillating, or 
firm, strong, stubborn? Do you like to be with 
people and do they like to be with you?” — and 
44
-P-A-G-E-57
  
SCIENTIFIC VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
so on. It is clear that the replies to questions of 
this kind can be of psychological value only when 
the questioner knows beforehand the mind of the 
youth, and can accordingly judge with what de- 
gree of understanding, sincerity, and ability the 
circular blanks have been filled out. But as the 
questions are put for the very purpose of revealing 
the personality, the entire effort tends to move 
in a circle. 
To break this circle, it indeed becomes neces- 
sary to emancipate one’s self from the method of 
ordinary self-observation and to replace it by 
objective experiment in the psychological lab- 
oratory. Experimentation in such a laboratory 
stands in no contrast to the method of introspec- 
tion. A contrast does exist between self-observa- 
tion and observation on children or patients or 
primitive peoples or animals. In their case the 
psychologist observes his material from with- 
out. But in the case of the typical laboratory 
experiment, everything is ultimately based on 
self-observation; only we have to do with the self- 
observation under exact conditions which the ex- 
perimenter is able to control and to vary at will. 
Even Parsons sometimes turned to little experi- 
mental inquiries in which he simplified some well- 
known methods of the laboratory in order to 
secure with the most elementary means a cer- 
45 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  
  - 
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
tain objective foundation for his mental analysis. 
For instance, he sometimes examined the mem- 
ory by reading to the boys graded sentences con- 
taining from ten to fifty words and having them 
repeat what they remembered, or he measured 
with a watch the rapidity of reading and writing, 
or he determined the sensitiveness for the dis- 
crimination of differences by asking them to make 
a point with a pencil in the centres of circles of va- 
rious sizes. But if such experimental schemes, 
even of the simplest form, are in question, it 
seems a matter of course that the plan ought to 
be prescribed by real scientists who specialize in 
the psychological field. The psychologist, for in- 
stance, surely cannot agree to a method which 
measures the-memory by such a method of hay- 
ing spoken sentences repeated and the quality 
of the memory faculty naively graded according 
to the results. He knows too well that there are 
many different kinds of memory, and would al- 
ways determine first which type of memory func- 
tions is to be examined if memory achievements 
are needed for a particular calling. 
But even. with a more exact method of experi- 
menting, such a procedure would not be sufficient 
to solve the true problem. A second step would 
still be necessary: namely, the adaptation of the 
experimental result to the special psychological 
46
-P-A-G-E-59
  
SCIENTIFIC VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
requirements of the economic activity; and this 
again presupposes an independent psychological 
analysis. Most of the previous efforts have suf- 
fered from the carelessness with which this sec- 
ond step was ignored, and the special mental re- 
quirements were treated as a matter of course 
upon which any layman could judge. In reality 
they need the most careful psychological analy- 
sis, and only if this is carried out with the means 
of scientific psychology, can a study of the abili- 
ties of the individual become serviceable to the 
demands of the market. Such a psychological 
disentangling of the requirements of the callings, 
in the interest of guidance, is attempted in the 
material which the various vocational institutes 
have prepared, but it seldom goes beyond com- 
monplaces. We read there, for instance,’ for 
the confectioner: “Boys in this industry must be 
clean, quick, and strong. The most important 
qualities desired are neatness and adaptability to 
routine’’; or for the future baker, the boy “ought 
to know how to conduct himself and to meet the 
public”’; or for the future architectural designer, 
“he must have creative ability, artistic feeling, 
and power to sketch’”’; or for the dressmaker, she 
“should have good eyesight and good sense of 
color, and an ability to use her hands readily; she 
should be able to apply herself steadily and be 
47
-P-A-G-E-60
  
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
fairly quick in her movements; neatness of person 
is also essential”; or for the stenographer, she must 
be “possessed of intelligence, good judgment, and 
common sense; must have good eyesight, good 
hearing, and a good memory; must have quick 
perception, and be able to concentrate her atten- 
tion completely on any matter in hand.” It is 
evident that all this is extremely far from any 
psychological analysis in the terms of science. 
All taken together, we may, therefore, say that 
in the movement for vocational guidance prac- 
tically nothing has been done to make modern 
experimental psychology serviceable to the new 
task. But on the one side, it has shown that this 
work of the experimental psychologist is the next 
step necessary. On the other side, it has become 
evident that in the vocation bureaus appropriate 
social agencies are existing which are ready to 
take up the results of such work, and to apply 
them for the good of the American youth and of 
commerce and industry, assoon as the experi- 
mental psychologist has developed the significant 
methods.

SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT 
EFORE we discuss some cases of such ex- 
perimental investigations, we may glance 
at that other American movement, the well- 
known systematic effort toward scientific man- 
agement which has often been interpreted in 
an expansive literature.° Enthusiastic followers 
have declared it to be the greatest advance in 
industry since the introduction of the mill system 
and of machinery. Opponents have hastily de- 
nounced it as a mistake, and have insisted that 
it proved a failure in the factories in which it has 
been introduced. A sober examination of the facts 
soon demonstrates that the truth lies in the middle. 
Those followers of Frederick W. Taylor who have 
made almost a religion out of his ideas have cer- 
tainly often exaggerated the practical applicability 
of the new theories, and their actual reforms in 
the mills have not seldom shown that the system 
is still too topheavy; that is, there are too many 
higher employees necessary in order to keep the 
works running on principles of scientific man- 
agement. On the other hand, the opposition 
which comes from certain quarters, — for instance, 
49
-P-A-G-E-62
  
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
from some trade-unions, — may be disregarded, 
as it is not directed against the claim that the effi- 
ciency can be heightened, but only against some 
social features of the scheme, such as the result- 
ing temporary reduction of the number of work- 
men. But nobody can deny that this revolu- 
tionary movement has introduced most valuable 
suggestions which the industrial world cannot 
afford to ignore, and that as soon as exaggerations 
are avoided and experience has created a broader 
foundation, the principles of the new theory will 
prove of lasting value. We shall have to discuss, 
at a later point, various special features of the 
system, especially the highly interesting motion 
study. Here we have to deal only with those tend- 
encies of the movement and with those interests 
which point toward our present problem, the 
mental analysis of the individual employees in 
order to avoid misfits. 
The approach to this problem, indeed, seems 
unavoidable for the students of scientific man- 
agement, as its goal is an organization of economic 
work by which the waste of energy will be avoided 
and the greatest increase in the efficiency of the 
industrial enterprise will be reached. The recog- 
nition that this can never be effected by a mere 
excessive driving of the workingmen belongs to 
its very presuppositions. The illusory means of 
50
-P-A-G-E-63
  
SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT 
prolongation of the working-time and similar de- 
vices by which the situation of the individual de- 
teriorates would be out of the question; on the 
contrary, the heightening of the individual’s joy 
in the work and of the personal satisfaction in 
one’s total life development belongs among the 
most important indirect agencies of the new 
scheme. This end is reached by many character- 
istic changes in the division of labor; also by a 
new division between supervisors and workers, by 
transformations of the work itself and of the tools 
and vehicles. But as a by-product of these efforts 
~ the demand necessarily arose for means by which 
the fit individuals could be found for special kinds 
of labor. The more scientific management intro- 
duced changes by which the individual achieve- 
ment often had to become rather complicated and 
difficult, the more it became necessary to study 
the skill and the endurance and the intelligence 
of the individual laborers in order to entrust these 
new difficult tasks only to the most appropriate 
men in the factories and mills. The problem of 
individual selection accordingly forced itself on 
the new efficiency engineers, and they naturally 
recognized that the really essential traits and dis- 
positions were the mental ones. In the most pro- 
gressive books of the new movement, this need of 
emphasizing the selection of workers with refer- 
51
-P-A-G-E-64
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
ence to their mental equipment comes to clear 
expression. 
Yet this is very far from a real application of 
scientific psychology to the problem at hand. 
Wherever the question of the selection of the fit 
men after psychological principles is mentioned 
in the literature of this movement, the language 
becomes vague, and the same men, who use the 
newest scientific knowledge whenever physics or 
mathematics or physiology or chemistry are in- 
volved, make hardly any attempts to introduce 
the results of science when psychology is in ques- 
tion. The clearest insight into the general situa- 
tion may be found in the most recent books by 
Emerson. He says frankly: = is psychology, 
not soil or climate, that enables a man to raise five 
times as many potatoes per acre as the average 
in his own state”;” or: “In selecting human as- 
sistants such superficialities as education, as 
physical strength, even antecedent morality, are 
not as important as the inner attitudes, procliv- 
ities, character, which after all determine the man 
or woman.” ® He also fully recognizes the ne- 
cessity of securing as early as Lsikusible the psycho- 
logical essentials. He says: “The type for the 
great newspaper is set up by linotype operators. 
Apprenticeship is rigorously limited. Some op- 
erators can never get beyond the 2500-em class, 
52 | 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT 
others with no more personal effort can set 5000 
ems. Do the employers test out applicants for 
apprenticeship so as to be sure to secure boys who 
will develop into the 5000-em class? They do not: 
they select applicants for any near reason except 
the fundamental important one of innate fit- 
ness.” ® But all this points only to the existence 
of the problem, and in reality gives not even a hint 
for its solution. The theorists of scientific manage- 
ment seem to think that the most subtle methods 
are indispensable for physical measurements, but 
for psychological inquiry nothing but a kind of 
intuition is necessary. Emerson tells how, for in- 
stance, “The competent specialist who has supple- 
mented natural gifts and good judgment by 
analysis and synthesis can perceive attitudes and 
proclivities even in the very young, much more 
readily in those semi-matured, and can with al- 
most infallible certainty point out, not only what 
work can be undertaken with fair hope of success, 
but also what slight modification or addition and 
diminution will more than double the personal 
power.” 1° The true psychological specialists 
surely ought to decline this flattering confidence. 
Far from the “almost infallible certainty,” they can 
hardly expect even a moderate amount of success 
in such directions so long as specific methods have 
not been elaborated, and so long as no way has 
53   
 
-P-A-G-E-66
- 
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
been shown to make experimental measurements 
by which such mere guesswork can be replaced 
by scientific investigation. 
The only modest effort to try a step in this 
direction toward the psychological laboratory is 
recorded by Taylor,!! who tells of Mr. S. E. 
Thompson’s work in a bicycle ball factory, where 
a hundred and twenty girls were inspecting the 
balls. They had to place a row of small polished 
steel balls on the back of the left hand and while 
they were rolled over and over in the crease be- 
tween two of the fingers placed together, they 
were minutely examined in a strong light and the 
defective balls were picked out with the aid of a 
magnet held in the right hand. The work re- 
quired the closest attention and concentration. 
The girls were working ten and a half hours a day. 
Mr. Thompson soon recognized that the quality 
most needed, beside endurance and industry, was 
a quick power of perception accompanied by 
quick responsive action. He knew that the psy- 
chological laboratory has developed methods for 
a very exact measurement of the time needed to 
react on an impression with the quickest possible 
movement; it is called the reaction-time, and is 
usually measured in thousandths of a second. He  * 
therefore considered it advisable to measure the | 
reaction-time of the girls, and to eliminate from | 
54 | |
-P-A-G-E-67
  
SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT 
service all those who showed a relatively long time 
between the stimulus and reaction. This involved 
laying off many of the most intelligent, hardest- 
working, and most trustworthy girls. Yet the 
effect was the possibility of shortening the hours 
and of reducing more and more the number of 
workers, with the final outcome that thirty-five 
girls did the work formerly done by a hundred 
and twenty, and that the accuracy of the work 
at the higher speed was two thirds greater than 
at the former slow speed. This allowed almost a 
doubling of the wages of the girls in spite of their 
shorter working-day, and at the same time a con- 
siderable reduction in the cost of the work for the 
factory. This excursion of an efficiency engineer 
into the psychological laboratory remained, how- 
ever, an entirely exceptional case. Moreover, such 
a reaction-time measurement did not demand 
any special development of new methods or any 
particular mental analysis, and this exception 
thus confirms the rule that the followers of scien- 
tific management principles have recognized the 
need of psychological inquiries, but have not 
done anything worth mentioning to apply the re- 
sults of really scientific psychology. Hence the 
situation is the same as in the field of vocational 
guidance. In both cases a vague longing for 
psychological analysis and psychological measure- 
55

ment, but in both cases so fur everything has 
remained on the level of helpless psychological 
dilettantism. It stands in striking contrast with 
the scientific seriousness with which the economic 
questions are taken up in the field of vocational 
guidance and the physical questions in the field of 
scientific management. It is, therefore, evidently 
the duty of the experimental psychologists them- 
selves to examine the ground from the point of 
view of the psychological laboratory.

  VII 
THE METHODS OF EXPERIMENTAL 
PSYCHOLOGY 
E now see clearly the psychotechnical 
problem. We have to analyze definite 
economic tasks with reference to the mental qual- 
ities which are necessary or desirable for them, and 
we have to find methods by which these mental 
qualities can be tested. We must, indeed, insist 
on it that the interests of commerce and industry 
can be helped only when both sides, the vocational 
demands and the personal function, are examined 
with equal scientific thoroughness. One aspect 
alone is unsatisfactory. It would of course be pos- 
sible to confine the examination to the individual 
mental traits, and then theoretically to determine 
for which economic tasks the presence of these 
qualities would be useful and for which tasks 
their absence or their deficiency would be fatal. 
Common sense may be sufficient to lead us a few 
steps in that direction. For instance, if we find 
by psychological examination that an individual 
is color-blind for red and green sensations, we may 
at once conclude, without any real psychological 
analysis of the vocations, that he would be unfit 
57  
-P-A-G-E-70
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
for the railroad service or the naval service, in 
which red and green signals are of importance. 
We may also decide at once that such a boy would 
be useless for all artistic work in which the nu- 
ances of colors are of consequence, or as a laborer 
in certain departments of a dyeing establishment, 
and that such a color-blind girl would not do at a 
dressmaker’s or in a millinery store. But if we 
come to the question whether such a color-blind 
individual may enter into the business of garden- 
ing, in spite of the inability to distinguish the 
strawberries in the bed or the red flowers among 
the green leaves, the first necessity, after all, 
would be to find out how far the particular de- 
mands of this vocation make the ability to dis- 
criminate color a prerequisite, and how far psy- 
chical substitutions, such as a recognition of the 
forms and of differences in the light intensity, may 
be sufficient for the practical task. Moreover, 
where not merely such mental defects, but more 
subtly shaded variations within normal limits are 
involved, it would be superficial, if only the men- 
tal states were examined and not at the same time 
the mental requirements of the vocations them- 
selves. The vocation should rather remain the 
starting-point. We must at first find out what 
demands on the mental system are made by it, and 
we must grade these demands in order to recog- 
58
-P-A-G-E-71
    EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY 
nize the more or less important ones, and, espe- 
cially for the important ones, we must then seek 
exact standards with experimental methods. 
Such an experimental investigation may pro- 
ceed according to either of two different principles. 
One way is to take the mental process which is 
demanded by the industrial work as an undivided 
whole. In this case we have to construct experi- 
mental conditions under which this total activity 
can be performed in a gradual, measurable way. 
The psychical part of the vocational work thus 
becomes schematized, and is simply rendered ex- 
perimentally on a reduced scale. The other way 
is to resolve the mental process into its compon- 
ents and to test every single elementary function 
in its isolated form. In this latter case the exam- 
ination has the advantage of having at its disposal 
all the familiar methods of experimental psycho- 
logy, while in the first case for every special voca- 
tional situation perfectly new experimental tests 
must be devised. 
Whether the one or the other method is to be 
preferred must depend upon the nature of the par- 
ticular commercial or industrial calling, and ac- 
cordingly presupposes a careful analysis of the 
special economical processes. It is, indeed, easy 
to recognize that in certain industrial activities 
a series of psychical functions is in question which 
59
-P-A-G-E-72
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
all lie side by side and which do not fuse into one 
united total process, however much they may 
influence one another. But for many industrial 
tasks just this unity is the essential condition. 
The testing of the mental elements would be in 
such cases as insufficient as if we were to test a 
machine with reference to its parts only and not 
with reference to its total united performance. 
Even in this latter case this unified function does 
not represent the total personality: it is always 
merely a segment of the whole mental life. We 
may examine with psychological methods, for 
instance, the fitness of an employee for a technical 
vocation and may test the particular complex 
unified combination of attention, imagination and 
intelligence, will and memory, which is essential 
for that special kind of labor. We may be able to 
reconstruct the conditions so completely that we 
would feel justified in predicting whether the 
individual can fulfill that technical task or not; 
and yet we may disregard entirely the question 
whether that man is honest or dishonest, whether 
he is pacific or quarrelsome; in short, whether his 
mental disposition makes him a desirable mem- 
ber of that industrial concern under other aspects. 
We best recognize the significance of these vari- 
ous methods by selecting a few concrete cases as 
illustrations and analzying them in detail. But a 
60
-P-A-G-E-73
EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY 
word of warning may be given beforehand so as 
to avoid misunderstandings. These examples do 
not stand here as reports of completed investiga- 
tions, the results of which ought to be accepted 
as conclusive parts of the new psychotechnical 
science; they are not presented as if the results 
were to be recommended like a well-tested ma- 
chine for practical purposes. Such really com- 
pleted investigations do not as yet exist in this 
field. All that can be offered is modest pioneer 
work, and just these inquiries into the mental 
qualities and their relations to the industrial vo- 
cations have attracted my attention only very re- 
cently, and therefore certainly still demand long 
continuations of the experiments in every direc- 
tion. But we may hope for satisfactory results 
the earlier, the more codperators are entering the 
field, and the more such researches are started 
in other places and in other institutions. I there- 
fore offer these early reports at the first stage of 
my research merely as stimulations, so as to de- 
monstrate the possibilities. 
As an illustration of the method of examining 
the mental process as a whole, I propose to discuss 
the case of the motormen in the electric railways. 
As an illustration of the other type, namely, of 
analyzing the activity and testing the elementary 
functions, I shall discuss the case of the employ- 
61
-P-A-G-E-74
    THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
ees in the telephone service. I select these two 
functions, as both play a practically important 
réle in the technique of modern economic life and 
as in both occupations very large numbers of in- 
dividuals are engaged in the work.

VIII 
EXPERIMENTS IN THE INTEREST OF ELECTRIC 
RAILWAY SERVICE 
HE problem of securing fit motormen for 
the electric railways was brought to my at- 
tention from without. The accidents which oc- 
curred through the fault, or at least not without 
the fault, of the motormen in street railway 
transportation have always aroused disquietude 
and even indignation in the public, and the street 
railway companies suffered much from the many 
payments of indemnity imposed by the court as 
they amounted to thirteen per cent of the gross 
earnings of some companies. Last winter the 
American Association for Labor Legislation 
called a meeting of vocational specialists to dis- 
cuss the problem of these accidents under various 
aspects. The street railways of various cities were 
represented, and economic, physiological, and 
psychological specialists took part in the general 
discussion. Much attention was given, of course, 
to the questions of fatigue and to the statistical 
results as to the number of accidents and their re- 
lation to the various hours of the day and to the 
time of labor. But there was a strong tendency 
63
-P-A-G-E-76
    THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
to recognize, as still more important than the 
mere fatigue, the whole mental constitution of the 
motormen. The ability to keep attention con- 
stant, to resist distraction by chance happenings 
on the street, and especially the always needed 
ability to foresee the possible movements of the 
pedestrians and vehicles were acknowledged as 
extremely different from man to man. The com- 
panies claimed that there are motormen who prac- 
tically never have an accident, because they feel 
beforehand even what the confused pedestrian 
and the unskilled chauffeur will do, while others 
relatively often experience accidents of all kinds 
because they do not foresee how matters will de« 
velop. They can hardly be blamed, as they were 
not careless, and yet the accidents did result from 
their personal qualities; they simply lacked the 
gift of instinctive foresight. All this turned the 
attention more and more to the possibilities of 
psychological analysis, and the Association sug- 
gested that I undertake an inquiry into this inter- 
esting problem with the means of the psycholog- 
ical laboratory. I felt the practical importance of 
the problem, considering that there are electric 
railway companies in this country which have up 
to fifty thousand accident indemnity cases a year. 
It therefore seemed to me decidedly worth while 
to undertake a laboratory investigation. 
64
-P-A-G-E-77
  ELECTRIC RAILWAY SERVICE 
It would have been quite possible to treat the 
functions of themotormen according to themethod 
which resolves the complex achievement into its 
various elements and tests every function inde- 
pendently. For instance, the stopping of the car 
as soon as the danger of an accident threatens is 
evidently effective only if the movement control- 
ling the lever is carried out with sufficient rapidity. 
We should accordingly be justified in examining 
the quickness with which the individual reacts on 
optical stimuli. If a playing child suddenly runs 
across the track of the electric railway, a differ- 
ence of a tenth of a second in the reaction-time 
may decide his fate. But I may say at once that 
I did not find characteristic differences in the 
rapidity of reaction of those motormen whom the 
company had found reliable and those who have 
frequent accidents. It seems that the slow indi- 
viduals do not remain in the service at all. Asa 
matter of course certain other indispensable sin- 
gle functions, like sharpness of vision, are exam- 
ined before the entrance into the service and so 
they cannot stand as characteristic conditions of 
good or bad service among the actual employees. 
For this reason, in the case of the motormen I 
abstracted from the study of single elementary 
functions and turned my attention to that mental 
process which after some careful observations 
65 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
seemed to me the really central one for the pro- 
blem of accidents. I found this to be a particular 
complicated act of attention by which the mani- 
foldness of objects, the pedestrians, the carriages, 
and the automobiles, are continuously observed 
with reference to their rapidity and direction in 
the quickly changing panorama of the street. 
Moving figures come from the right and from the 
left toward and across the track, and are embed- 
ded in a stream of men and vehicles which moves 
parallel to the track. In the face of such mani- 
foldness there are men whose impulses are almost 
inhibited and who instinctively desire to wait for 
the movement of the nearest objects; they would 
evidently be unfit for the service, as they would 
drive the electric car far too slowly. There are 
others who, even with the car at high speed, can 
adjust themselves for a time to the complex mov- 
ing situation, but whose attention soon lapses, and 
while they are fixating a rather distant carriage, 
may overlook a pedestrian who carelessly crosses 
the track immediately in front of their car. In 
short, we have a great variety of mental types of 
this characteristic unified activity, which may be 
understood as a particular — of atten- 
tion and imagination. 
My effort was to transplant this activity of the 
motormen into laboratory processes. And here 
66 |

ELECTRIC RAILWAY SERVICE 
I may include a remark on the methodology of 
psychological industrial experiments. One might 
naturally think that the experience of a special 
industrial undertaking would be best reproduced 
for the experiment by repeating the external con- 
ditions in a kind of miniature form. That would 
mean that we ought to test the motormen of the 
electric railway by experiments with small toy 
models of electric cars placed on the laboratory 
table. But this would be decidedly inappropri- 
ate. A reduced copy of an external apparatus may 
arouse ideas, feelings, and volitions which have 
little in common with the processes of actual life. 
The presupposition would be that the man to be 
tested for any industrial achievement would have 
to think himself into the miniature situation, 
and especially uneducated persons are often very 
unsuccessful in such efforts. This can be clearly 
seen from the experiences before naval courts, 
where it is usual to demonstrate collisions of ships 
by small ship models on the table in the court- 
room. Experience has frequently shown that 
helmsmen, who have found their course a life 
long among real vessels in the harbor and on the 
sea, become entirely confused when they are to 
demonstrate by the models the relative positions 
of the ships. Even in the naval war schools where 
the officers play at war with small model ships, 
67 
   
-P-A-G-E-80
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
a certain inner readjustment is always necessary 
for them to bring the miniature ships on the large 
table into the tactical game. On the water, for 
instance, the naval officer sees the far-distant 
ships very much smaller than those near by, 
while on the naval game table all the ships look 
equally large. On the whole, I feel inclined to 
say from my experience so far that experiments 
with small models of the actual industrial mechan- 
ism are hardly appropriate for investigations in 
the field of economic psychology. The essential 
point for the psychological experiment is not the 
external similarity of the apparatus, but exclus- 
ively the inner similarity of the mental attitude. 
The more the external mechanism with which 
or on which the action is carried out becomes 
schematized, the more the action itself will ap- 
pear in its true character. 
In the method of my experiments with the 
motormen, accordingly, I had to satisfy only two 
demands. The method of examination promised 
to be valuable if, first, it showed good results with 
reliable motormen and bad results with unrelia- 
ble ones; and, secondly, if it vividly aroused in all 
the motormen the feeling that the mental function 
which they were going through during the experi- 
ment had the greatest possible similarity with 
their experience on the front platform of the elec- 
68
-P-A-G-E-81
  
ELECTRIC RAILWAY SERVICE 
tric car. These are the true tests of a desirable ex- 
perimental method, while it is not necessary that 
the apparatus be similar to the electric car or 
that the external activities in the experiment be 
identical with their performance in the service. 
After several unsatisfactory efforts, in which I 
worked with too complicated instruments, I 
finally settled on the following arrangement of 
the experiment which seems to me to satisfy 
those two demands. 
The street is represented by a card 9 half- 
inches broad and 26 half-inches long. Two heavy 
lines half an inch apart go lengthwise through 
the centre of the card, and accordingly a space of 
4 half-inches remains on either side. The whole 
eard is divided into small half-inch squares 
which we consider as the unit. Thus there is in 
any cross-section 1 unit between the two central 
lines and 4 units on either side. Lengthwise 
there are 26 units. The 26 squares which lie be- 
tween the two heavy central lines are marked 
with the printed letters of the alphabet from A to 
Z. These two heavy central lines are to repre- 
sent an electric railway track on a street. On 
either side the 4 rows of squares are filled in an 
irregular way with black and red figures of the 
three first digits. The digit 1 always represents 
a pedestrian who moves just one step, and that 
69 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
means from one unit into the next; the digit 2 a 
horse, which moves twice as fast, that is, which 
moves 2 units; and the digit 3 an automobile 
which moves three times as fast, that is, 3 units. 
Moreover, the black digits stand for men, horses, 
and automobiles which move parallel to the track 
and cannot cross the track, and are therefore to 
be disregarded in looking out for dangers. The 
red digits, on the other hand, are the dangerous 
ones. They move from either side toward the 
track. The idea is that the man to be experi- 
mented on is to find as quickly as possible those 
points on the track which are threatened by the 
red figures, that is, those letters in the 26 track 
units at which the red figures would land, if they 
make the steps which their number indicates. A 
red digit 3 which is 4 steps from the track is to be 
disregarded, because it would not reach the 
track. A red digit 3 which is only 1 or 2 steps 
from the track is also to be disregarded, because it 
would cross beyond the track, if it took 3 steps. 
But a red 3 which is 3 units from the track, a 
red 2 which is 2 units from the track, and a red 
1 which is 1 unit from the track would land on 
the track itself; and the aim is quickly to find 
these points. The task is difficult, as the many 
black figures divert the attention, and as the red 
figures too near or too far are easily confused 
70
-P-A-G-E-83
  ELECTRIC RAILWAY SERVICE 
with those which are just at the dangerous dis- 
tance. 
As soon as this principle for the experiment was 
recognized as satisfactory, it was necessary to 
find a technical device by which a movement over 
this artificial track could be produced in such a 
way that the rapidity could be controlled by the 
subject of the experiment and at the same time 
measured. Again we had to try various forms of 
apparatus. Finally we found the following form 
most satisfactory. Twelve such cards, each pro- 
vided with a handle, lie one above another under 
a glass plate through which the upper card can 
be seen. If this highest card is withdrawn, the 
second is exposed, and from below springs press 
the remaining cards against the glass plate. The 
glass plate with the 12 cards below lies in a black 
wooden box and is completely covered by a belt 
8 inches broad made of heavy black velvet. This 
velvet belt moves over two cylinders at the front 
and the rear ends of the apparatus. In the centre 
of the belt is a window 4% inches wide and 4h inches high. If the front cylinder is turned by a 
metal crank, the velvet belt passes over the glass 
plate and the little window opening moves over 
the card with its track and figures. The whole 
breadth of the card, with its central track and its 
4 units on either side, is visible through it over 
71 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
an area of 5 units in the length direction. If the 
man to be experimented on turns the crank with 
his right hand, the window slips over the whole 
length of the card, one part of the card after an- 
other becomes visible, and then he simply has to 
call the letters of those units in the track at which 
the red figures on either side would land, if they 
took the number of steps indicated by the digit. 
At the moment the window has reached Z on the 
card, the experimenter withdraws that card and 
the next becomes visible, as a second window in 
the belt appears at the lower end when the first 
disappears at the upper end. In this way the sub- 
ject can turn his crank uninterruptedly until he 
has gone through the 12 cards. The experimenter 
notes down the numbers of the cards and the letters 
which the subject calls. Besides this, the number 
of seconds required for the whole experiment, 
from the beginning of the first card to the end of 
the twelfth, is measured with a stopwatch. This 
time is, of course, dependent upon the rapidity 
with which the crank is turned. The result of the 
experiment is accordingly expressed by three 
figures, the number of seconds, the number of 
omissions, that is, of places at which red figures 
would land on the track which were not noticed 
by the subject; and, thirdly, the number of in- 
correct places where letters were called in spite 
72 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
ELECTRIC RAILWAY SERVICE 
of the fact that no danger existed. In using the 
results, we may disregard this third figure and 
give our attention to the speed and the number of 
omissions. 
The necessary condition for carrying out the ex- 
periments with this apparatus is a careful, quiet, 
practical explanation of the device. The experi- 
ment must not under any circumstances be started 
until the subject completely understands what he 
has to do and for what he has to look out. For 
this purpose I at first always show the man one 
card outside of the apparatus and explain to him 
the differences between the black and the red 
figures, and the counting of the steps, and show 
to him in a number of cases how some red figures 
do not reach the track, how others go beyond the 
track, and how some just land in danger on the 
track. As soon as he has completely understood 
the principle, we turn to the apparatus and he 
moves the window slowly over a test card and 
tries to find the dangerous spots, and I turn his 
attention to every case in which he has omitted 
one or has given an incorrect letter. We repeat 
this slowly until he completely masters the rules 
of the game. Only then is he allowed to start 
the experiment. I have never found a man with 
whom this preparation takes more than a few 
minutes.

  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
After developing this method in the psycho- 
logical laboratory, I turned to the study of men 
actually in the service of a great electric railway 
company which supported my endeavors in the 
most cordial spirit. In accordance with my re- 
quest, the company furnished me with a number 
of the best motormen in its service, men who for 
twenty years and more had performed their du- 
ties practically without accidents, and, on the 
other hand, with a large number of motormen who 
had only just escaped dismissal and whose record 
was characterized by many more or less import- 
ant collisions or other accidents. Finally, we had 
men whose activity as motormen was neither 
especially good nor especially bad. 
The test of the method lies first in the fact that 
the tried motormen agreed that they really pass 
through the experiment with the feeling which 
they have on their car. The necessity of looking 
out in both directions, right and left, for possible 
obstacles, of distinguishing those which move 
toward the track from the many which move 
along the track, the quick discrimination among 
the various rates of rapidity, the steady forward 
movement of the observation point, the constant 
temptation to give attention to those which are 
still too far away or to those which are so near 
that they will cross the track before the approach 
74
-P-A-G-E-87
  
ELECTRIC RAILWAY SERVICE 
of the car, in short, the whole complex situation 
with its demands on attention, imagination, and 
quick adjustment, soon brings them into an atti- 
tude which they themselves feel as identical with 
that in practical life. On the other hand, the re- 
sults show a far-reaching correspondence between 
efficiency in the experiment and efficiency in the 
actual service. With a relatively small number of 
experiments this correspondence cannot be ex- 
pected to be complete, the more as a large number 
of secondary features must enter which interfere 
with an exact correlation between experiment and 
standing in the railway company. We must con- 
sider, for instance, that those men whom the com- 
pany naturally selects as models are men who 
have had twenty to thirty years of service with- 
out accidents, but consequently they are rather 
old men, who no longer have the elasticity of 
youth and are naturally less able to think them- 
selves into an artificial situation like that of such 
an experiment, and who have been for a long time 
removed from contact with book work. It is 
therefore not surprising, but only to be expected, 
that such older, model men, while doing fair work 
in the test, are yet not seldom far surpassed by 
bright, quick, young motormen who are twenty 
years younger, even though they are not yet 
ideal motormen. Moreover, the standing in the 
15 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
company often depends upon features which have 
nothing to do with the mental make-up of the 
man, while the experiment has to be confined 
to those mental conditions which favor accidents. 
It is quite possible that a man may happen to 
experience a slight collision, even though no con- 
ditions for the accident were lying in his mental 
make-up. But we may go still further. The ex- 
periment refers to those sides of his mind which 
make him able to foresee the danger points, and 
that is decidedly the most essential factor and 
the one from which most can be hoped for the 
safety of the public. But this does not exclude the 
possibility that some other mental traits may be- 
come causes of accidents. The man may be too 
daring and may like to run risks, or he may still 
need discipline, or he may not be sufficiently 
acquainted with the local conditions. Any such 
secondary factors may cause some slight acci- 
dents with the man who shows rather fair results 
in the experimental test of his foresight. Finally, 
we must not forget that some men enter into such 
tests under a certain nervous tension and there- 
fore may not show so well at the very first test 
as their mental equipment should allow. Hence 
it is decidedly desirable not to rely on the first 
test, but to repeat it. If those various interfer- 
ences are taken into account, the correspondence 
76
-P-A-G-E-89
  
ELECTRIC RAILWAY SERVICE 
between efficiency and the results of the tests is 
fairly satisfactory. It justified me in proposing 
that the experiments be continued and in regard- 
ing it as quite possible that later tests on the 
basis of this principle may be introduced at the 
employment of motormen. 
A difficulty is presented by the valuation of the 
numerical results. The mere number of omissions 
alone cannot be decisive, as it is clear that no in- 
telligent man would make any omissions if he 
should give an unlimited amount of time to it; 
for instance, if he were to spend fifteen minutes 
on those 12 cards. But this is the same thing 
as to say that a motorman would not run over 
any one if he were to drive his car one mile in an 
hour. The practical problem is to combine the 
greatest possible speed with the smallest number 
of oversights, and both factors must therefore 
be considered. The subject who makes relatively 
many mistakes but uses a very short time must 
be acknowledged to be as good as the man who 
makes fewer mistakes but takes a longer time. 
In the results which I have gathered in experi- 
ments with motormen, no one has gone through 
those 12 cards in a shorter time than 140 seconds, 
while the longest time was 427 seconds. On the 
other hand, no one of the motormen made less 
than 4 omissions, while the worst ones made 28 
V7
-P-A-G-E-90
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
omissions. I abstract from one extreme case with 
36 omissions. On the whole, we may say that the 
time fluctuates between 180 and 420, the mis- 
takes between 4 and 28. The aim is to find a for- 
mula which gives full value to both factors and 
makes the material directly comparable in the form 
of one numerical value instead of the two. If we 
were simply to add the number of seconds and the 
number of omissions, the omissions would count 
far too little, inasmuch as 10 additional omissions 
would then mean no more than 10 additional 
seconds. On the other hand, if we were to multi- 
ply the two figures the omissions would mean by 
far too much, as the transition from 4 mistakes to 
8 mistakes would then be as great a change as the 
transition from 200 to 400 seconds, that is, from 
the one extreme of time to the other. Evidently 
we balance both factors if we multiply the number 
of omissions by 10 and add them to the number 
of seconds. The variations between 4 and 28 
omissions are 24 steps, which multiplied by 10 
correspond to the 240 steps which lie between 
180 and 420 seconds. On that basis any additional 
50 seconds would be equal to 5 additional omis- 
sions. If of two men one takes 100 seconds less 
than his neighbor, he is equal to him in his ability 
to satisfy the demands of the service, if he makes 
10 mistakes more. 
78
-P-A-G-E-91
  ELECTRIC RAILWAY SERVICE 
On the basis of this calculation I find that the 
old, well-trained motormen come to a result of 
about 450, and I should consider that an average 
standard. This would mean that a man who 
uses 400 seconds would not be allowed to make 
more than 5 omissions, in 350 seconds not more 
than 10, in 300 not more than 15, in 250 not more 
than 20, under the condition that these are the 
results of the first set of experiments. Where 
there are more than 20 omissions made, mere 
quickness ought not to be allowed as a substitute. 
The man who takes 150 seconds and makes 30 
mistakes would come up to the same standard 
level of 450. Yet his characteristics would prob- 
ably not serve the interests of the service. He 
would speed up his car and would make better 
time than any one else, but would be liable to ac- 
cidents. I should consider 20 mistakes with a 
time not longer than 250 as the permissible maxi- 
mum. Among the younger motormen whom I 
examined, the best result was 290, in which 270 
seconds were used and only 2 omissions made. 
Results below 350 may be considered as very 
good. One man, for instance, carried out the ex- 
periment in 237 seconds with 11 mistakes, which 
gives the result 347. From 350 to 450 may be 
counted as fair, 450 to 550 as mediocre, and over 
550 as very poor. In the case of old men, who may 
19
-P-A-G-E-92
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
be expected to adjust themselves less easily to 
artificial experiments, the limits may be shifted. 
If the experiments are made repeatedly, the valua- 
tion of the results must be changed accordingly. 
The training of the men in literary and mathe- 
matical work or in experimentation may be con- 
sidered, as our experiments have shown that highly 
educated young people with long training in 
experimental observations can pass through the 
test much more quickly than any one of the motor- 
men could. Among the most advanced graduate 
students who do research work in my Harvard 
laboratory there was no one whose result was 
more than 275, while, as I said, among all the 
motormen there was no one whose result was less 
than 290. The best result reached was by a stu- 
dent who passed through the test in 223 seconds 
with only 1 mistake, the total therefore being 233. 
Next came a student who did it in 215 seconds 
with 3 mistakes, total, 245; then in 228 seconds 
with 2 omissions, total, 248, and so on. 
I recapitulate: With men on the educational 
level and at the age that comes in question for 
their first appointment in the service of an elec- 
tric railway company, the test proposed ought to 
be applied according to this scheme. If they make 
more than 20 mistakes, they ought to be excluded; 
if they make less then 20 mistakes, the number of 
80
-P-A-G-E-93
  ELECTRIC RAILWAY SERVICE 
omissions is to be multiplied by 10 and added to 
the number of seconds. If the sum is less than 
350, their mental fitness for the avoidance of ac- 
cidents is very high, between 350 and 450 fair, 
and more than 550 not acceptable under any 
conditions. I submit this, however, with the em- 
phasis on my previous statement that the investi- 
gation is still in its first stage, and that it will need 
a long coéperation between science and industry’ 
in order to determine the desirable modifications 
and special conditions which may become neces- 
sary in making the employment of men partly de- 
pendent upon such psychological tests. There 
can be no doubt that the experiments could be 
improved in many directions. But even in this 
first, not adequately tested, form, an experimen- 
tal investigation of this kind which demands from 
each individual hardly 10 minutes would be suf- 
ficient to exclude perhaps one fourth of those who 
are nowadays accepted into the service as motor- 
men. This 25 per cent of the applicants do not 
deserve any blame. In many other occupations 
they might render excellent service; they are 
neither careless nor reckless, and they do not act 
against instructions, but their psychical mechan- 
ism makes them unfit for that particular combina- 
tion of attention and imagination which ought to 
be demanded for the special task of the motor- 
81

  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
man. If the many thousands of injury and the 
many hundreds of death cases could be reduced 
by such a test at least to a half, then the condi- 
tions of transportation would have been improved 
more than by any alterations in the technical 
apparatus, which usually are the only objects 
of interest in the discussion of specialists. The 
whole world of industry will have to learn the 
great lesson, that of the three great factors, ma- 
terial, machine, and man, the man is not the least, 
but the most important.

EXPERIMENTS IN THE INTEREST OF 
SHIP SERVICE 
HERE the avoidance of accidents is in 
question, the test of a special experimental 
method can seldom be made dependent upon a 
comparison with practical results, as we do not 
want to wait until the candidate has brought hu- 
man life into danger. The ordinary way of reach- 
ing the goal must therefore be an indirect one in 
such cases. For the study of motormen the con- 
ditions are exceptionally favorable, as hundreds of 
thousands of accidents occur every year, but an- 
other practical example may be chosen from a field 
where it is, indeed, impossible to correlate the re- 
sults with actual misfortunes, because the danger- 
ous situations occur seldom; and nevertheless on 
account of ,their importance they demand most 
serious study. I refer to the ship service, where 
the officer on the bridge may bring thousands 
into danger by one single slip of his mind. I turn 
to this as a further concrete illustration in order 
to characterize at once the lengths to which such 
vocational studies may advance. 
_One of the largest ship companies had ap- 
83
-P-A-G-E-96
    
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
proached me — long before the disaster of the 
‘Titanic occurred — with the question whether it 
would not be possible to find psychological meth- 
ods for the elimination of such ship officers as 
would not be able to face an unexpected suddenly 
occurring complication. The director of the com- 
pany wrote to me that in his experience the real 
danger for the great ships lies in the mental dis- 
positions of the officers. They all know exactly 
what is to be done in every situation, but there 
are too many who do not react in the appropriate 
way when an unexpected combination of factors 
suddenly confronts them, such as the quick ap- 
proach of a ship in the fog. He claimed that two 
different types ought to be excluded. There are 
ship officers who know the requirements excel- 
lently, but who are almost paralyzed when the 
dangerous conditions suddenly threaten. Their 
ability for action is inhibited. In one moment 
they want to act under the stimulus of one impres- 
sion, but before the impulse is realized, some other 
perhaps rather indifferent impression forces itself 
on their minds and suggests the counteraction, 
and in this way they vacillate and remain inactive 
until it is too late to give the right order or to 
press the right button. The other type feels only 
the necessity for rapid action, and under the pres- 
sure of greatest haste, without clear thought, they 
84
-P-A-G-E-97
    SHIP SERVICE 
jump to the first decision which rushes to their 
minds. Without carefully considering the condi- 
tions really given, they explode in an action which 
they would never have chosen in a state of quiet 
deliberation. They react'on any accidental cir- 
cumstance, just as at a fire men sometimes carry 
out and save the most useless parts of their belong- 
ings. Of course, beside these two types, there is 
the third type, the desirable one, the men who in 
the unexpected situation quickly review the total- 
ity of the factors in their relative importance and 
with almost instinctive certainty immediately 
come to the same decision to which they would 
have arrived after quiet thought. The director 
of the company insisted that it would be of high- 
est importance for the ship service to discriminate 
these three types of human beings, and to make 
sure that there stand on the bridge of the ship 
only men who do not belong to those two danger- 
ous classes. He turned to me with this request, 
as he had heard of the work toward economic 
psychology in the Harvard laboratory. 
As the problem interested me, I carried on a 
long series of experiments in order to construct 
artificial conditions under which the mental pro- 
cess of decision in a complicated situation, espe- 
cially the rapidity, correctness, and constancy of 
the decision, could be made measurable. I started 
85
-P-A-G-E-98
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
from the conviction that this complex act of de- 
cision must stand in definite relation to a number 
of simpler mental functions. If, for instance, it 
stood in a clear definite relation to the process of 
association, or discrimination, or suggestibility, 
or perception, or memory, and so on, it would be 
rather easy to foresee the behavior of the individ- 
ual in the act of decision, as every one of those 
other simple mental functions could be tested by 
routine methods of the psychological laboratory. 
This consideration led me to propose ramified 
investigations concerning the psychology of de- 
cision in its relation to the elementary mental pro- 
cesses. These studies by students of the labora- 
tory are not yet completed. But I soon saw that 
they would be unfit for the solution of my prac- 
tical problem, as we recognized that these rela- 
tions between the complex act of decision and the 
elementary functions of the individual seem to 
have different form with different types of men.” 
If I was to approach the solution of the prac- 
tical problem, accordingly, I had to reproduce 
in an experimental form the act of decision under 
complex conditions. 
It seemed necessary to create a situation in 
which a number of quantitatively measurable fac- 
tors were combined without any one of them fore- 
ing itself to consciousness as the most important. 
86
-P-A-G-E-99
  SHIP SERVICE 
The subject to be experimented on then has to de- 
cide as quickly as possible which of the factors is 
the relatively strongest one. As usual, here, too, 
I began with rather complicated material and 
only slowly did I simplify the apparatus until it 
finally took an entirely inconspicuous form. But 
this is surely the most desirable outcome for test- 
ing methods which are to be applied to large num- 
bers of persons. Complicated instruments, for the 
handling of which special training is needed, are 
never so useful for practical purposes as the sim- 
ple schemes which can be easily applied. The 
form of which I finally made use is the following. I 
work with 24 cards of the size of playing-cards. 
On the upper half of every one of these cards we 
have 4 rows of 12 capital letters, namely, A, E, 
O, and U in irregular repetition. On 4 cards, one of 
these vowels appears 21 times and each of the 
three others 9 times; on 8 cards, one appears 18 
times and every one of the three others 10 times; 
on 8 cards, one appears 15 times and each of the 
others 11 times; and finally, on 4 cards one vowel 
appears 16 times, each of the three others 8 times, 
and besides them 8 different consonants are mixed 
in. The person to be tested has to distribute these 
24 cards as quickly as possible in 4 piles, in such a 
way that in the first pile are placed all cards in 
which the letter A is most frequent, in the second 
87
-P-A-G-E-100
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
those in which the letter E predominates, and so 
on. As a matter of course the result must never 
be secured by counting the letters. Any attempt 
to act against this prescription and secretly to be- 
gin counting would moreover delay the decision 
so long that the final result would be an unsatis- 
factory achievement anyhow. It would accord- 
ingly bring no advantage to the candidate. 
We measure with a stopwatch in fifths of a 
second the time for the whole process from the 
subject’s looking at the first card to his laying 
down of the last card, and, secondly, we record 
the number and the character of his mistakes, if 
cards are put into wrong piles. I have made the 
experiment with very many persons, and results 
show that those various mental traits which have 
been observed in the practical ship service come 
clearly to light under the conditions of this experi- 
ment. Some of the persons lose their heads en- 
tirely, and for many of them it is a painful activ- 
ity for which they require a long time. Even if the 
number of mistakes is not considerable, they 
themselves have the feeling that they are not 
coming to a satisfactory decision, because their 
attention is pulled hither and thither so that they 
feel an inner mental paralysis. Some chance let- 
ters stand out and appear to them to be predom- 
inant, but in the a moment the attention is 
88
-P-A-G-E-101
SHIP SERVICE 
captured by some other letters which bring the 
suggestion that they are in the majority and that 
they present the most important factor. The out- 
come is that inner state of indecision which can 
become so fatal in practical life. Other subjects 
distribute the cards in piles at a relatively high 
speed, and they do it with the subjective feeling 
that they have indeed recognized at the first 
glance the predominant group of letters. The ex- 
act measurement of the results, however, shows 
that they commit many errors which would have 
been improbable after quiet consideration. Any 
small group of letters which catches their eye 
makes on them, under the pressure of their haste, 
such a strong impression that all the other letters 
are inhibited for the moment and the wrong de- 
cision is quickly made. Finally, we find a group 
of persons who carry out the experiment rather 
quickly and at the same time with few mistakes. 
It is characteristic of them to pass through it with 
the feeling that it is an agreeable and stimulating 
mental activity. In all cases the subjects feel 
themselves under the unified impression which re- 
sults from all those 48 letters of the card together; 
and this is the reason why the qualitative mani- 
foldness of a practical life situation can be com- 
pared with these intermingled, quantitatively 
determined groups of letters.

THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
If I consider the general results of these experi- 
ments only with reference to the time-measure- 
ment, I should say that a person who completes 
the distribution of the cards in less than 80 seconds 
is quick in his decisions; from 80 to 150, moder- 
ately quick; from 150 to 250, slow and deliberate 
and rather too deliberate for situations which de- 
mand quick action; over 250 seconds, he would be- 
long among those wavering persons who hesitate 
too long in a life situation which demands deci- 
sion. The time which is needed for the mere distri- 
bution of the cards themselves plays a very small 
réle compared with the time of the whole pro- 
cess, and can be neglected. In order to determine 
this, I asked all the subjects before they made 
the real experiment to distribute 24 other cards in 
4 piles, on each of which one of the four letters, 
A, E, O, and U was printed only once. Hence no 
comparison of various factors was involved in 
this form of distribution. The average time for 
this ordinary sorting was about 20 seconds. Only 
rather quick individuals carried it out in less than 
18 and only very slow ones needed more than 25 
seconds. This maximum variation of 10 seconds 
is evidently insignificant, as the variations in 
the experiment amount to more than 200 seconds. 
But it is very characteristic that the results of 
the two experiments do not move parallel. Some 
90  
-P-A-G-E-103
  SHIP SERVICE 
persons, who are able to sort the cards on which 
only one of the 4 letters is printed very quickly, 
are rather slow when they sort the cards with the 
48 letters for which the essential factor is the act 
of comparison. In the first case the training in 
card-playing also seems to have a certain influ- 
ence, but in the second case, our real experiment 
on decision, this influence does not seem to exist. 
We have emphasized from the start that it is 
no less important to give consideration to the 
number of mistakes. A mere rapidity of distribu- 
tion with many mistakes characterizes, as we saw, 
a mental system which is just as unfit for practi- 
cal purposes as one which acts with too great slow- 
ness. But it would not have been sufficient simply 
to ask how many cards were put into wrong piles. 
The special arrangement of the cards with four 
different types of combinations was introduced 
for the purpose of discriminating among mistakes 
of unequal seriousness. When one letter appeared 
21 times and the three others only 9 times, it was 
surely much easier to make the decision than 
when the predominant letter appeared only 15 
times and the other three each 11 times. The 
easier the right decision, the graver the mistake. 
Of course the valuation of these mistakes must be 
rather arbitrary. We decided to value as 4 every 
mistake in these cards on which the predominant 
91
-P-A-G-E-104
ee ee ere 
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
letter appears 21 times; as 3, a mistake in the 
18 letter cards; as 2, a mistake in the 16 letter 
cards; and as 1, a mistake in the most difficult 
ones, the 15 letter cards. If the mistakes are cal- 
culated on this basis and are added together, a sum 
below 5 may indicate a very safe and perfectly re- 
liable ability for decision; 5 to 12, satisfactory; 
12 to 20, uncertain; and over 20, very poor. In 
order to take account of both factors, time and 
mistakes, we multiply the sum of the calculated 
mistakes by the number of seconds. If the pro- 
duct of these two figures is less than 400, it may 
be taken as a sign of perfect reliability in making 
very quick, correct decisions, in complex life situ- 
ations; 400 to 1000 indicates the limits between 
which the ability for such decisions may be con- 
sidered as normal and very satisfactory; 1000 to 
2000, not good but still adequate; 2000 to 3000, 
unreliable, and over 3000, practically absent. 
It is clear that the real proof of the value of this 
method cannot be offered. This is just the reason 
why we selected this illustration as an example of 
the particular difficulty. Wrong decisions, that is, 
cases in which the man on the bridge waits too 
long before he makes his decision and thus causes 
a collision of ships by his delay, or in which he 
tushes blindly to a decision which he himself would 
have condemned after quiet deliberation, are

rare. It would be impossible to group such men 
together for the purpose of the experiment and 
to compare their results with those of model cap- 
tains, the more as experience has shown that an 
officer may have a stainless record for many years 
and yet may finally make a wrong decision which 
shows his faulty disposition. The test of the 
method must therefore be a somewhat indirect 
one. My aim was to compare the results of the 
experiments with the experiences of the various 
individuals which they themselves reported con- 
cerning their decisions in unexpected complicated 
situations, and moreover with the judgments of 
their friends whom I asked to describe what they 
would expect from the subjects under such condi- 
tions. The personal differences in these respects 
are extremely great, and are also evident in the 
midst of small groups of persons who may have 
great similarity in their education and training 
and in many other aspects of their lives. 
Among the most advanced students of my re- 
search laboratory, for instance, all of whom have 
rather similar schooling and practically the same 
training in experimental work, the product of mis- 
takes and seconds varied between 348 and 13,335. 
That smallest value occurred in a case in which 
the time was 116 seconds and the sum of the mis- 
takes only 3, inasmuch as 8 cards of the most dif- 
93
-P-A-G-E-106
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
ficult group where the predominating letter oc- 
curred only 15 times were put in the wrong piles. 
The shortest time among my laboratory students 
was 58 seconds, but with this individual the sum 
of the mistakes, calculated on the basis of the val- 
uation agreed upon, was 18. The largest figure 
mentioned resulted in a case in which the student 
needed 381 seconds and yet made mistakes the 
sum of which amounted to 35. It is characteristic 
that the person with the smallest product felt a 
distinct joy in the experiment, while the one with 
the largest passed through painful minutes which 
put him to real organic discomfort. If we arrange 
the men simply in the order of these products, of 
course we cannot recognize the various groups, as 
those who are quick but make mistakes and those 
who make few mistakes but act slowly may be rep- 
resented by the same products. The coincidence 
of the results with the self-characterization is fre- 
quently quite surprising. Every one has at some 
time come into unexpected, suddenly arising situ- 
ations and many have received in such moments 
a very vivid impression of their own mental reac- 
tion. They know quite well that they could not 
come to a decision quickly enough, or that they 
rushed hastily to a wrong decision, or that in just 
such instants a feeling of repose and security 
came over them and that with sure instinct they 
94
-P-A-G-E-107
SHIP SERVICE 
turned in the direction which they would have 
chosen after mature thought. The results of the 
experiments in sorting the cards confirmed this 
self-observation in such frequent cases that it 
may indeed be hoped that a more extended test 
of this method will prove its practical usefulness. 
It is clear that the field is a wide one, as these dif- 
ferent types of mental dispositions must be of con- 
sequence not only in the ship service, but also to a 
certain degree in the railroad service and in many 
other industrial tasks. 
We have emphasized from the start that as a 
matter of course such a tested function, while it is 
taken in its complex unity, is nevertheless not the 
only psychophysical disposition of significance. 
This is as true for the ship officer as it was for the 
motorman of the electric car. If we were to study 
all the mental dispositions necessary or desirable 
for the ship officer, we should find many other 
qualities which are accessible to the psycholog- 
ical investigation. The captain of the ship, for 
instance, is expected to recognize the direction of 
a vessel passing in the fog by the signals of the 
foghorn. But so far no one has given any atten- 
tion to the psychological conditions of localization 
of sound, which were for a long while a much- 
studied problem of our psychological laboratories. 
We know how this localization is dependent upon 
95 
   
-P-A-G-E-108
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
the comparison of the two ears and what particu- 
lar mistakes occur from the different sensibility 
of the two ears. Yet there are to-day men on the 
bridges of the ships who hear much better with 
one ear than with the other, but who still naively 
believe that, as they hear everything very dis- 
tinctly with one ear, this normal ear is also suffi- 
cient for recognizing the direction of the sound. 
It is the same mistake which we frequently see 
among laborers whose vision has become defect- 
ive in one of their eyes, or one of whose eyes is 
temporarily bandaged. They are convinced that 
the one good eye is sufficient for their industrial 
task, because they are able to recognize every- 
thing clearly and distinctly. They do not know 
that both the eyes together are necessary in order 
- to produce that psychological combination by 
which the visual impression is projected into the 
right distance, and that in the factory they are 
always in danger of underestimating the distance 
of a wheel or some other part of the machine and 
of letting the hand slip between the wheels or 
knives. The results of experimental psychology 
will have to be introduced systematically into the 
study of the fitness of the personality from the 
lowest to the highest technical activity and from 
the simplest sensory function to the most complex 
mental achievement.

EXPERIMENTS IN THE INTEREST OF 
TELEPHONE SERVICE 
UR plan was to illustrate the possibility 
of applying psychological experiments to 
the selection of fit applicants also in cases in which 
not one characteristic mental function stands out, 
but in which a large number of relatively inde- 
pendent mental activities are in play. I choose as 
an illustration of such cases the work of the em- 
ployees at the telephone switchboard. A study 
of the psychological factors in this work is strongly 
suggested by the practical interests of the tele- 
phone companies, and may be looked on here ex- 
clusively from this point of view. The user of the 
telephone is little inclined to consider how many 
actions have to be carried out in the central office 
before the connection is made and finally broken 
again. From the moment when the speaker takes 
off the receiver to the cutting off of the connec- 
tion, fourteen separate psychophysical processes 
are necessary in the typical case, and even then 
it is presupposed that the telephone girl under- 
stood the exchange and number correctly. It isa 
common experience of the companies that these 
97
-P-A-G-E-110
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
demands cannot be satisfactorily fulfilled when a 
telephone girl has to handle more than 225 calls 
in an hour. The official statistics show that this 
figure is exceeded in not infrequent cases,’* in 
extreme cases the number may even rise beyond 
300. Moreover, in short periods of reinforced de- 
mands it may happen that for a few minutes even 
the rapidity of 10 calls in a minute is reached. 
Normally the burden is divided among the em- 
ployees in such a way that about 150 calls fall to 
each one in an hour, and that this figure is passed 
considerably only in one morning and one evening 
hour. A skillful distribution of pauses and ample 
arrangements for rest, usually together with very 
excellent hygienic conditions, make it possible 
for the fit persons to be able to carry on this work 
without over-fatigue from 8 to 9 hours a day. On 
the other hand, it is only natural that such rapid 
and yet subtle activity under such high tension, 
where especially the quick localization of the cor- 
rect hole is a difficult and yet indispensable part, 
can be carried out only by a relatively small num- 
ber of human nervous systems. The inability to 
keep attention at such a high point for a long 
while, or to perform such rapid movements, or to 
retain the numbers correctly, does'not lead to fatal 
accidents like those in the case of the unfit mo- 
tormen, but it does lead to fatigue and finally to 
98
-P-A-G-E-111
  TELEPHONE SERVICE 
a nervous breakdown of the employees and to con- 
fusion in the service. The result is that the com- 
pany is continually obliged to dismiss a consider- 
able proportion of those who have entered the 
service and who have spent some months in going 
through the training school of the company. As 
one single company, the Bell Telephone Com- 
pany, employs 16,000 operators, the problem is an 
expansive one, and it has bearing on the health of 
the employees as well as on the patience of the 
subscribers. But above all it refers to the eco- 
nomic interests of the company, inasmuch as 
every girl who satisfies the entrance conditions 
of hearing and sight, of school education and 
general personal appearance, receives some salary 
throughout the months of training in the tele- 
phone school. Since during the first half-year, 
in which the employee still works entirely under 
supervision, more than a third of those who had 
originally entered leave, partly on account of un- 
fitness and inability, partly on account of over- 
fatigue or similar reasons, the economic disadvan- 
tage to the company is evidently a very great one. 
The candidates are paid for months of mere train- 
ing, and they themselves waste their energy and 
time with practice in a kind of labor which cannot 
be serviceable to them in any other economic 
activity. Under these circumstances it is not sur-

prising that one city system approached me with 
the question whether it would not interest me 
from a scientific point of view to examine how far 
the mental fitness of the employees could be de- 
termined beforehand through experimental means. 
After carefully observing the service in the cen- 
tral office for a while, I came to the conviction 
that it would not be appropriate here to repro- 
duce the activity at the switchboard in the experi- 
ment, but that it would be more desirable to re- 
solve that whole function into its elements and to 
undertake the experimental test of a whole series 
of elementary mental dispositions. Every one 
of these mental acts can then be examined accord- 
ing to well-known laboratory methods without 
giving to the experiments any direct relation to 
the characteristic telephone operation as such. 
I carried on the first series of experiments with 
about thirty young women who a short time be- 
fore had entered into the telephone training 
school, where they are admitted only at the age 
between seventeen and twenty-three years. I 
examined them with reference to eight different 
psychophysical functions. In saying this, I ab- 
stract from all those measurements and tests which 
had somewhat anthropometric character, such 
as the measurement of the length of the fingers, 
the rapidity of breathing, the rapidity of pulse, 
100
-P-A-G-E-113
  TELEPHONE SERVICE 
the acuity of vision and of hearing, the distinct- 
ness of the pronunciation, and so on. A part of 
the psychological tests were carried on in individ- 
ual examinations, but the greater part with the 
whole class together. 
These common tests referred to memory, at- 
tention, intelligence, exactitude, and rapidity. I 
may characterize the experiments in a few words. 
The memory examination consisted of reading to 
the whole class at first two numbers of 4 digits, 
then two of 5 digits, then two of 6 digits, and so 
on up to figures of 12 digits, and demanding that 
they be written down as soon as a signal was given. 
The experiments on attention, which in this case 
of the telephone operators seemed to me espe- 
cially significant, made use of a method the prin- 
ciple of which has frequently been applied in the 
experimental psychology of individual differences 
and which I adjusted to our special needs. The 
requirement is to cross out a particular letter in a 
connected text. Every one of the thirty women 
in the classroom received the same first page of a 
newspaper of that morning. I emphasize that it 
was a new paper, as the newness of the content was 
to secure the desired distraction of the attention. 
As soon as the signal was given, each one of the 
girls had to cross out with a pencil every ‘“‘a” in 
the text for six minutes. After a certain time, a 
101
-P-A-G-E-114
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
bell signal was given and each then had to begin 
a new column. In this way we could find out, 
first, how many letters were correctly crossed out 
in those six minutes, secondly, how many letters 
were overlooked, and, thirdly, how the recogni- 
tion and the oversight were distributed in the 
various parts of the text. In every one of these 
three directions strong individual differences 
were indeed noticeable. Some persons crossed out 
many, but also overlooked many, others over- 
looked hardly any of the “a’s,” but proceeded 
very slowly so that the total number of the 
crossed-out letters was small. Moreover, it was 
found that some at first do poor work, but soon 
reach a point at which their attention remains on 
a high level; others begin with a relatively high 
achievement, but after a short time their atten- 
tion flags, and the number of crossed-out letters 
becomes smaller or the number of unnoticed, 
overlooked letters increases. Fluctuations of at- 
tention, deficiencies, and strong points can be 
discovered in much detail. 
The third test which was tried with the whole 
class referred to the intelligence of the individuals. 
Discussion of the question how to test intelligence 
in general would quickly lead us into as yet unset- 
tled controversies. It is a chapter of the psycho- 
logy of tests which, especially in the service of 
102
-P-A-G-E-115
  TELEPHONE SERVICE 
pedagogy but to a certain degree also in the serv- 
ice of medicine, has been more carefully elabor- 
ated than any other. Often it has been contested 
whether we have any right to speak of one gen- 
eral central intelligence factor, and whether this 
apparently unified activity ought not to be re- 
solved into a series of mere elementary processes. 
The newer pedagogical investigations, however, 
speak in favor of the view that besides all special 
processes, or rather, above all of them, an ability 
must be recognized which cannot be divided any 
further, and by which the individual adjusts his 
knowledge, his experiences, and his dispositions 
to the changing purposes of life. The grading of 
the pupils in a class usually expresses this differ- 
entiation of theintelligence; and while the differ- 
ences of industry or of mere memory and similar 
secondary features may sometimes interfere, it 
remains after all not difficult for an observant 
teacher to grade the pupils of his class, whom he 
knows well, according to their general intelligence. 
The psychological experiments carried on in the 
schoolroom have demonstrated that this ability 
can be tested by the measurement of some very 
simple mental activities. The best method would 
be the one which would allow the experimenter, 
on the basis of a single experiment, to grade 
the individuals in the same order in which they 
103
-P-A-G-E-116
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
appear in the record of the teacher. Among 
the various proposed schemes for this purpose 
the figures suggest that the most reliable one is the 
following method, the results of which show the 
highest agreement between the rank order based 
on the experiments and the rank order of the 
teachers.14 The experiment consists in reading 
to the pupils a long series of pairs of words of 
which the two members of the pair always logic- 
ally belong together. Later, one word of each 
pair will be read to them and they have to write 
down the word which belonged with it in the pair. 
This is not a simple experiment on memory. The 
tests have shown that if instead of logically con- 
nected words simply disconnected chance words 
are offered and reproduced, no one can keep such 
a long series of pairs in mind, while with the words 
which have related meaning, the most intelligent 
pupils can master the whole series. The very fav- 
orable results which this method had yielded in 
the classroom made me decide to try it in this case 
too. I chose for an experiment 24 pairs of words 
from the sphere of experience of the girls to be 
tested. Two further class experiments belonged 
rather to the periphery of psychology. The 
exactitude of space-perception was measured by 
demanding that each divide first the long and 
then the short edge of a folio sheet into two equal 
104
-P-A-G-E-117
  TELEPHONE SERVICE 
halves by a pencil mark. And finally, to measure 
the rapidity of movement, it was demanded that 
every one make with a pencil on the paper zigzag 
movements of a particular size during the ten 
seconds from one signal to another. 
After these class experiments I turned to indi- 
vidual tests. First, every girl had to sort a pack 
of 48 cards into 4 piles as quickly as possible. The 
time was measured in fifths of a second. The fol- 
lowing experiment which referred to the accuracy 
of movement impulses demanded that every one 
try to reach with the point of a pencil 3 different 
points on the table in the rhythm of metronome 
beats. On each of these three places a sheet of 
paper was fixed with a fine cross in the middle. 
The pencil should hit the crossing point, and the 
marks on the paper indicated how far the move- 
ment had fallen short of the goal. One of these 
movements demanded the full extension of the 
arm and the other two had to be made with half- 
bent arm. I introduced this last test because the 
hitting of the right holes in the switchboard of the 
telephone office is of great importance. The last 
individual experiment was an association test. 
I called six words like “book,” “house,” “rain,” 
and had them speak the first word which came to 
their minds. The time was measured in fifths of a 
second only, as subtler experiments, for which 
105
-P-A-G-E-118
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
hundredths of a second would have to be ‘con- 
sidered, were not needed. 
In studying the results so far as the memory 
experiments were concerned, we found that it 
would be useless to consider the figures with more 
than 10 digits. We took the results only of those 
with 8, 9, and 10 digits. There were 54 possibilities 
of mistakes. The smallest number of actual mis- 
takes was 2, the largest, 29. In the experiment on 
attention made with the crossing-out of letters, 
we found that the smallest number of correctly 
marked letters was 107, the largest number in the 
six minutes, 272; the smallest number of over- 
looked letters was 2, the largest, 135; but this last 
case of abnormal carelessness stood quite isolated. 
On the whole, the number of overlooked letters 
fluctuated between 5 and 60. If both results, 
those of the crossed-out and those of the over- 
looked letters, are brought into relation, we find 
that the best results were a case of 236 letters 
marked, with only 2 overlooked, and one of 257 
marked, with 4 overlooked. The very interesting 
details as to the various types of attention which 
we see in the distribution of mistakes over the six 
minutes were not taken into our final table. The 
word experiments by which we tested the intelli- 
gence showed that no one was able to reproduce 
more than 22 of the 24 words. The smallest num- 
106
-P-A-G-E-119
  
TELEPHONE SERVICE 
ber of words remembered was 7. The mistakes 
in the perception.of distances fluctuated between 
land 14 millimeters; the time for the sorting of 
the 48 cards, between 35 and 58 seconds; the as- 
sociation-time for the 6 associated words taken 
together was between 9 and 21 seconds. The 
pointing experiments could not be made use of in 
this first series, as it was found that quite a num- 
ber of participants were unable to perform the act 
with the rapidity demanded. 
Several ways were open to make mathematical 
use of these results. I preferred the simplest way. 
I calculated the grade of the girls for each of these 
achievements. The same candidate who stood in 
the 7th place in the memory experiment was in the 
15th place with reference to the number of letters 
marked, in the 8rd place with reference to the let- 
ters overlooked, in the 21st place with reference to 
the number of word pairs which she had grasped, 
in the 11th place with reference to the exactitude 
of space-perception, in the 16th place with refer- 
ence to the association-time, and in the 6th place 
with reference to the time of sorting. As soon as 
we had all these independent grades,we calculated 
the average and in this way ultimately gained a 
common order of grading. It is evident that this 
kind of calculation contains accidental factors, 
especially as a consequence of the fact that we 
107 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
give equal value to every one of these results. It 
might be better, for instance, to attribute a higher 
value to-the attention experiment or to the intel- 
ligence experiment. This could be done by mul- 
tiplying the results of some of these grades by 2 
or by 3, which would bring the high or low grade 
of a girl for a particular function to stronger 
influence in the final result. But in this first trial 
I contented myself with the simplest uniform 
scheme in order to exclude all arbitrariness, and 
therefore considered the mere average of all the 
grades as the expression of the experimental 
result. 
With this average rank list, we compared the 
practical results of the telephone company after 
three months had passed. These three months 
had been sufficient to secure at least a certain dis- 
crimination between the best, the average, and the 
unfit. The result of this comparison was on the 
whole satisfactory. First, the skeptical telephone 
company had mixed with the class a number of 
women who had been in the service for a long 
while and had even been selected as teachers in 
the telephone school. I did not know, in figuring 
out the results, which of the participants in the ex- 
periments these particularly gifted outsiders were. 
If the psychological experiments had brought the 
result that these individuals who stood so high 
108
-P-A-G-E-121
  TELEPHONE SERVICE 
in the estimation of the telephone company 
ranked low in the'laboratory experiment, it would 
have reflected strongly on the reliability of the 
laboratory method. The results showed, on the 
contrary, that these women who had proved most 
able in practical service stood at the top of our 
list. Correspondingly, those who stood the low- 
est in our psychological rank list had in the mean 
time been found unfit in practical service and 
had either left the company of their own accord or 
else had been eliminated. The agreement, to be 
sure, was not a perfect one. One of the list of 
women stood rather low in the psychological list, 
while the office reported that so far she had done 
fair work in the service, and two others to whom 
the psychological laboratory gave a good testi- 
monial were considered by the telephone office as 
only fair. 
But it is evident that certain disagreements 
would have occurred even with a more ideal 
method, as on the one side no final achievement 
in practical service can be given after only three 
months, and because on the other side a large 
number of secondary factors may enter which 
entirely overshadow the mere question of psycho- 
physical fitness. Poor health, for instance, may 
hinder even the most fit individual from doing 
satisfactory work, and extreme industry and ener- 
109
-P-A-G-E-122
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
getic will may for a while lead even the unfit to 
fair achievement, which, to be sure, is likely to 
be coupled with a dangerous exhaustion. The 
slight disagreements between the psychological 
results and the practical valuation, therefore, do 
not in the least speak against the significance of 
such a method. On the other hand, I emphasize 
that this first series meant only the beginning of 
the investigation, and it can hardly be expected 
that at such a first approach the best and most 
suitable methods would at once be hit upon. A 
continuation of the work will surely lead to much 
better combinations of test experiments and to 
better adjusted schemes. But it would be most 
desirable that such studies be undertaken at 
various places according to various schemes in 
order to come nearer to the solution of a problem 
which is economically important to the whole 
public and to many thousands of employees. As 
soon as methods are really perfected it would 
seem not at all impossible that by a short ex- 
periment of a few minutes thousands of appli- 
cants might be saved long months of study and 
training which are completely wasted. For us 
here the detailed analysis of this particular case 
did not mean a suggestion to use to-day in the tel- 
ephone offices of the country the special scheme 
which we applied, but it stood only as a clear, 
110

simple illustration of a method by which not the 
specific work itself is tested, but by which the in- 
dustrial work of the individual is resolved into 
a long series of parallel functions each one of 
which is tested independently. ‘The experimental 
aid which the laboratory has to supply in such 
cases is not a newly invented device, such as we 
needed in the case of the motormen, but simply 
the methods well known as so-called mental 
tests. 
The experiments with such tests by which 
single mental functions are measured approxi- 
mately in short quick examinations, has been 
much discussed in psychological circles. For a 
long while the thorough scholars remained very 
reluctant to accept such an apparently superficial 
scheme, when these tests were proposed especially 
for the pedagogical interests of the schoolroom. 
It was a time in which the scientific efforts were 
completely devoted to the general problems of the 
human mind and in which individual differences 
were very little considered. Moreover, the ques- 
tions of applied psychology still seemed so far 
distant that the true scholar instinctively took 
his standards from the methods of purely theo- 
retical research. Seen from such a point of view, it 
could not be denied that the tests were not suffi- 
cient to give us a complete scientific analysis of 
111
-P-A-G-E-124
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
the personality in its subtler structure. The theo- 
rists knew too well that if the reactions, or asso- 
ciations, or memories, or tendencies of attention, 
or emotions of a subject were measured really with 
that scientific thoroughness which is the ideal 
of research, long months of experiments would 
be needed, and little could be hoped for from 
tests to be performed in half an hour. But this 
somewhat haughty reserve which was quite justi- 
fied twenty years ago has become obsolete and 
would be meaningless to-day. On the one side 
the methods themselves have been multiplied; 
for each mental act like memory, attention, and 
so on, dozens of well-studied tests are at our dis- 
posal, which are adjusted to the finest ramifica- 
tions of the functions.!® On the other side the 
interest in individual differences and in applied 
psychology has steadily grown, and through it 
an understanding for the real meaning of the tests 
has been gained. Their value, indeed, lies exclus- 
ively in their relation to the practical problems. 
Where theoretical questions are to be answered 
and scientific studies concerning the laws and 
variations of the mind are to be undertaken, the 
long series of laboratory experiments carried on 
with patience and devotion are indispensable 
and can never be replaced by the short-cut meth- 
ods of the tests. But where practical tasks of 
112
-P-A-G-E-125
  TELEPHONE SERVICE 
pedagogy or jurisprudence or medicine, or es- 
pecially of commerce and industry, are before us, 
the method of tests ought to be sovereign. It can 
be adapted to the special situations and can suc- 
ceed perfectly, if the task is to discover the out- 
lines of the mental individuality for particular 
practical work. : 
The only real difficulty of the method lies in the 
ease with which it can be used. A device which 
presupposes complicated instruments deters the 
layman and will be used only by those who are 
well trained. Moreover, the amateur would not 
think of constructing and adapting such appara- 
tus himself. But when nothing is necessary but to 
use words or numbers or syllables or pictures, or, 
as in those experiments which we just described, 
newspapers and so on, any one feels justified in 
applying the scheme or in replacing it by a new 
apparently better one according to his caprice. 
The manifoldness of the proposed tests for special 
functions is therefore enormous to-day. What is 
needed now is surely much more that order be 
brought into this chaos of propositions, and that 
definite norms and standards be secured for cer-

variations simply be increased. 
The chief danger, moreover, lies in the fact that 
those who are not accustomed to psychological

laboratory research are easily misled. They fancy 
that such an experiment can be carried out in a 
mere mechanical way without careful study of all 
the conditions and accompanying circumstances, 
Thereby a certain crudeness of procedure may 
enter which is not at all suggested by the test 
method itself. The psychological layman too 
seldom recognizes how many other psychical 
functions may play a réle in the result of the ex- 
periment beside the one which is interesting him 
at that moment. The well-schooled laboratory 
worker almost automatically gives consideration 
to all such secondary circumstances. While his 
experiments may refer to the process of memory, 
he will yet at the same time carefully consider the 
particular situation as to the emotional setting 
of the subject, as to his attention, as to his pre- 
ceding experience, as to his intelligence, as to his 
physiological condition, and many other factors 
which may have indirect influence even on the 
simplest memory test. Hence the real perform- 
ance of the experiments ought to be undertaken 
only by those who are thoroughly familiar and 
well trained in psychological research. And they 
alone, moreover, can decide what particular form 
such an experiment ought to take in a given prac- 
tical situation. It must be left to them, for in- 
stance, to judge in which cases the mental func-

after being resolved into its components and in 
which it ought to be examined in its characteris- 
tic unity.

\ X YHILE the psychologists have to perform 
the actual labor, the representatives of 
practical life are much better able to indicate the 
points at which the psychological levers ought 
to be applied. In the past year I have sought 
contact with several hundred large concerns in 
America which belong to many different indus- 
trial realms. My time did not allow me personal 
observation in so many cases, but everywhere I 
begged for information from the leading men. I 
asked in individual letters for the particular psy- 
chological qualities which from the standpoint 
of the management seemed essential for the va- 
rious kinds of labor in their establishments. I 
always inquired to what extent consideration was 
given to such psychological points of view at the 
appointment of applicants, and asked for material 
concerning the question how far individuals who 
proved to be unfit for one kind of labor showed 
fitness at other kinds of work. The replies which 
L received from all sides varied from a few mean- 
ingless lines to long documents, which in some 
cases were composed of detailed reports from all 
the department chiefs of a particular concern.

The common fundamental turn was decidedly 
a feeling of strong interest in the formulation of 
the question, which was practically new to all of 
them. Whether the answer came from paper mills 
or machine shops, from meat-packing houses or 
from breweries, from electrical or chemical mills, 
from railroad or mining companies, from depart- 
ment stores or from publishing houses, every- 
where it was acknowledged that they had given 
hardly any conscious attention to the real psy- 
chological dispositions of their employees. They 
had of course noticed whether their men were 
industrious or lazy, honest or dishonest, skillful 
or clumsy, peaceful or quarrelsome people, but 
I had emphasized from the start in all my letters 
that such points of view were not before my mind. 
The mental qualities for which I asked were the 
psychological functions of attention, memory, 
ideas, imagination, feeling, volition, suggestibil- 
ity, ability to learn, ability to discriminate, judg- 
ment, space-sense, time-sense, and so on. It 
would lead too far here to discuss why these two 
groups of characteristics indeed belong to two 
different aspects of mental life, and why only the 
latter is strictly psychological. The way in which 
the management is accustomed to look on their 
men is the practical way of ordinary life, in which 
we try to understand our neighbor by entering 
117
-P-A-G-E-130
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
into the meaning of his mental functions and by 
seeking to grasp what his aim is. But such an in- 
terpretation of the other man’s mind is not a 
psychological analysis. It gives us the purposes of 
his inner life, but does not show us its structure 
and its component parts. We can abstract from 
interpreting and appreciating in order to describe 
the elements of the mind which in themselves have 
no meaning and no value, but which are the only 
important factors, if we are to determine psycho- 
logically what we may expect from the individual. 
While the replies to my letters showed that 
hardly any attention had so far been given to such 
problems of objective psychology in the industrial 
concerns, it became evident that the managers 
felt distinctly that here a problem was touched 
which must be of highest importance for economic 
success. From many different sides willingness 
was shown to study the problem of employment 
under the psychological aspect. As my material 
came mostly from very large establishments in 
which labor of very many different kinds is car- 
ried on side by side, of course I frequently re- 
ceived the assurance that whenever an indus- 
trious energetic man is unsuccessful in one kind 
of work, a trial is made with him in another de- 
partment, and that by such shifting the right 
place can often be found for him. Young people,

to whom, in spite of long trial and the best will, 
it seems impossible to supply certain automatic 
machines, become excellent workers at much more 
difficult labor in the same establishment. Women 
who are apparently careless and inattentive when 
they have to distribute their attention over a 
number of operations do high-class work when 
they are engaged in a single activity; and in other 
cases the opposite is reported. 
I may mention a few concrete chance illustra- 
tions. In a pencil factory the women in one de- 
partment have to grasp with one movement a 
dozen pencils, no more and no less. Some learn 
this at once without effort, and they earn high 
wages; others never can learn it in spite of re- 
peated trials. If those who fail in this depart- 
ment are transferred, for instance, to the depart- 
ment where the gold-leaf is most carefully to be 
applied to the pencils before stamping, very often 
they show great fitness in spite of the extreme 
exactitude needed for this work. To show how 
often activities which appear extremely similar 
may demand different individuals, if the work is 
based on different psychical functions, I may re- 
fer to a report from one of the largest establish- 
ments in the country. In the accounting depart- 
ment a large number of girls are occupied with 
looking over hundreds of thousands of slips from 
119
-P-A-G-E-132
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
which the weekly pay-list is compiled. Each slip 
contains six figures and small groups of twenty 
slips have to be looked through to see whether 
those six figures on each correspond. With moist- 
ened forefinger they turn up the slips one by one 
in much the same manner that a bank clerk counts 
money. A good sorter will turn up the slips so 
rapidly that a bystander is unable to read a single 
figure, and yet she will not overlook an error in 
thousands of slips. After the slips are sorted, the 
operation of obtaining the totals on each order 
number is performed with the aid of an adding 
machine. The machine operator rolls up the slips 
of the pile with the thumb of her left hand and 
transfers the amount to the proper keys of the 
machine. It has been found that the most rapid 
and accurate girls at sorting are not seldom use- 
less on the machines. They press the wrong keys 
and make errors in copying the total from the ma- 
chine indicators to the file-card. On the other 
hand, some of the best machine operators are very 
slow and inaccurate at the sorting table. Girls 
have been found very poor at the work at which 
they were first set, and very successful and effi- 
cient as soon as they had been transferred from 
the one to the other. 
Examples of this kind might be heaped up 
without end. But while the very large establish- 
120
-P-A-G-E-133
  CONTRIBUTIONS FROM MEN OF AFFAIRS 
ments demonstrate by such reports only that 
they can find somewhere a fit place for every able 
workingman if they take enough trouble to seek 
for it, after all the essential element of the reports 
remains, that successful achievement depends 
upon personal mental traits which cannot be ac- 
quired by mere good will and training. In view 
of this fact it is much more important that by far 
the majority of establishments have not such a 
great manifoldness of activities under one roof. 
The workingman who is a failure in the work 
which he undertook would usually have no op- 
portunity to show his strong sides in the same 
factory, or at least to be protected against the 
consequences of his weak points. If his achieve- 
ment is deficient in quality or quantity, he gen- 
erally loses his place and makes a new trial in 
another factory under the same accidental con- 
ditions, without any deeper insight into his 
particular psychical traits and their relation to 
special industrial activities. But even in the large 
concerns, in which many kinds of labor are needed 
side by side, it is not the rule but a rare exception 
when the individual is systematically shifted to 
the psychologically correct place. A whole com- 
bination of conditions is necessary for that. If 
his mental unfitness makes him unsuccessful in 
one place, the position for which he is fit must 
121 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
happen to be vacant. Moreover, he himself must 
like that other kind of work, and above all the 
foreman must recognize his particular fitness. 
In a few model factories in which the apprentice 
system is developed in the spirit of advanced 
sociological ideas, for instance, in the Lynn fac- 
tory of the General Electric Company, such sys- 
tematic efforts are being carried on and show fair 
results. But the regulation plan seems to be a 
haphazard lack of plan, and even the best en- 
deavors probably fall short of what may be at- 
tained by the introduction of scientific psycho- 
logical methods. So far in most factories the 
laborer who is not doing well simply loses his 
position, and by such an unfortunate experience 
he is not mentally enriched but impoverished, as 
he has lost much of his self-confidence and of his 
joy in labor. 
If this limitless waste of human material, this 
pitiable crushing of joy in the day’s work, and 
this crippling of the economic output is at last 
to be reduced, indeed nothing is more needed 
than a careful scrutiny of the various psychophy- 
sical functions involved in the work. A mere 
classification of the industrial occupations accord- 
ing to the classes of manufactured objects would 
be of no value for this need, as often a small in- 
dustrial concern may embrace occupations which 
122
-P-A-G-E-135
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM MEN OF AFFAIRS 
are based on many different psychophysical func- tions. A harvester consists of two hundred and fifty different parts, and almost every one of these parts demands a long series of manufacturing pro- cesses. Thousands of different kinds of labor are thus combined in one factory and each process 
demands for the best work particular psycho- 
physical traits, even though many of them can be carried out by quite unskilled laborers. In a large 
manufacturing establishment the manager as- sured me only recently that more than half a mil- lion different acts have to be performed in order to complete the goods of that factory. On the other hand, it evidently is proper to form larger groups in which processes are brought together 
which are similar with reference to the mental 
activity needed, while they may be dissimilar 
from the standpoint of industrial technique. 
This analysis of the special processes can be furthered best by the codperation of the experi- enced men of industry. Many of the replies which I received contained quite elaborated con- tributions to such a study of various industrial 
Processes from a psychological point of view. They sometimes covered the ground from the sim- plest activity to the subtlest and most difficult economic tasks, and this, not only with reference 
to the functions of the laborer, but also even with 
123
-P-A-G-E-136
— 
THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
reference to the function of the industrial man- 
ager. The outsider can see these psychological 
requirements of the particular occupation only in 
crude outlines. The subtler nuances of differences 
between tasks can be gained only by an intimate 
knowledge of the industry. Again I may give an 
illustration. In the case of a well-known type- 
setting machine, thousands of which are in daily 
use, I had the impression that the rapidity of 
the performance was dependent upon the quick- 
ness of the finger reaction. The managers, on 
the other hand, have found that the most es- 
sential condition for speed in the whole work 
is the ability to retain a large number of words 
in memory before they are set. The man who 
presses the keys rather slowly advances more 
rapidly than another who moves his fingers 
quickly, but must make many pauses in order to 
find his place in the manuscript and to provide 
himself with new words. 
The factors which are tobe brought into corre- 
lation are, accordingly, first, the actual experi- 
ences of the managers, secondly, the observations 
of skilled psychologists in the industrial concerns, 
thirdly, psychological and experimental investiga- 
tions with successful and unsuccessful laborers, 
and, fourthly, experimental studies of the normal 
variability. If such a programme is to be realized 
124 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  CONTRIBUTIONS FROM MEN OF AFFAIRS 
in detail, it will be necessary to discriminate care- 
fully between those mental traits of the personal- 
ity which must be accredited to a lasting inherited 
disposition and such as have been developed 
under the influences of the surroundings, by edu- 
cation and training, by bad or good stimuli from 
the community. While those acquired traits may 
have become relatively lasting dispositions, their 
transformation is, after all, possible, and the lim- 
its in which changes may be expected will have 
to be found out by exact studies. Individual psy- 
chological rhythm, attention and emotion, mem- 
ory and will energy, disposition to fatigue and to 
restoration, imagination, suggestibility and initia- 
tive, and many other features will have to be exam- 
ined in their relation to the special economic aims. 
Too much emphasis cannot be laid on another 
function as well, the experimental testing of which 
has only recently been started. I refer to the dif- 
ference in the individual ability of men to profit 
from training. If we test an individual at acertain 
point in his life with regard to a variable ability, 
our result must be dependent upon three factors, 
the original disposition for the performance, the 
original disposition for the advance by training, 
and the training itself actually passed through up 
to that moment. A small amount of antecedent 
training for the particular task together with a 
125
-P-A-G-E-138
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
high ability to profit from repetition may be a 
better reason for the appointment of a man than 
a long training with small ability to profit from 
schooling, in spite of the fact that his actual 
achievement at this time may be in the first case 
smaller than in the second. He will do less at 
first, but he promises to outrank the other man 
after a period of further training. Special experi- 
ments must be carried on and have been actually 
started to determine this plasticity of the psycho- 
physical apparatus as an independent inborn trait 
of the individual.'* 
This invasion of psychology into the field of 
economic activities is still so little advanced that 
the thought of a real distribution of the wage- 
earners among the various commercial and 
industrial positions on the basis of psychological 
tests would lead far beyond the present possi- 
bilities. Moreover, many factors would interfere 
with its being carried out consistently, even if a 
much higher stage of experimental research were 
reached. The thousands of social and local rea- 
sons which influence the choice of a vocation to- 
day would to a certain degree remain in force also 
in a period of better psychological analysis. More- 
over, the personal inclinations and interests nat- 
urally would and ought to remain the mainspring 
of economic action. This inclination, which gives 
126
-P-A-G-E-139
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM MEN OF AFFAIRS 
so much of the joy in labor, is by no means neces- 
sarily coincident with those psychophysical dispo- 
sitions which insure the most successful work. 
Political economists have found this out repeat- 
edly from their statistical inquiries. Very careful 
studies of the textile industry in Germany car- 
ried out in recent years?” yielded the result that 
the intelligent, highly trained textile laborer 
often dislikes his work the more, the more he 
shows ability for it, this ability being measured: 
by the wages the individuals earn at piecework. 
The wage and the emotional attitude were not 
seldom inversely related. Those who were able 
to produce by far more than others and accord- 
ingly earned the most were sometimes the very 
ones who hated the work, while the less skillful 
workers earned less but enjoyed the work more. 
The consulting economic psychologist will, there- 
fore, at first reasonably confine himself to warning 
the misfits at an early time. Even within these 
limits his service can be useful to both parties, the 
employers and the employees. He will only slowly 
reach the stage at which this negative warning 
may be supplemented by positive suggestions, as 
to the commercial industrial activities for which 
the psychophysical dispositions promise particu- 
lar success. 
A real assumption of responsibility for success 
127  
-P-A-G-E-140
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
of course cannot be risked by the psychologist, in- 
asmuch as the man who may be fitted for a task 
by his mental working dispositions may neverthe- 
less destroy his chances for success by secondary 
personal traits. He may be dishonest, or dissi- 
pated, or a drinker, or a fighter, or physically 
ill. Finally, we ought not to forget that all such 
efforts to adjust to one another the psycholog- 
ical traits and the requirements of the work can 
never have reference to the extreme variations 
of human traits. The exceptionally talented man 
knows anyhow where he belongs, and the excep- 
tionally untalented one will be excluded anyhow. 
The psychological aid in the selection of the fit 
refers only to the remaining four fifths of mankind 
for whom the chances of success can indeed be 
increased as soon as the psychological personal 
equation is systematically and with scientific ex- 
actitude brought into the calculation of the life 
development. How far a part of this effort will 
have to be undertaken by the school is a social 
problem which must be considered from various 
points of view. Its discussion would lead us be- 
yond the limits of our present inquiry, but it seems 
probable that the real psychological laboratory 
experiment in the service of vocational guidance 
does not belong in the schoolroom itself, but ought 
to be left to special municipal institutions.
-P-A-G-E-141

INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS 
NE point here must not be overlooked. The 
effort to discover the personal structure of 
the individual in the interest of his vocational 
chance does not always necessarily involve a di- 
rect analysis of his individuality, as material of 
some value can be gained indirectly. Such indi- 
rect knowledge of a man’s mental traits may be 
secured first of all through referring the man to 
the groups to which he belongs and inquiring into 
the characteristic traits of those groups. ; The 
psychology of human variations gives not only an 
account of the differences from person to person, 
but studies no less the psychical inequalities of the 
races, of the nations, of the ages, of the profes- 
sions, and so on. If an economic activity demands 
a combination of mental traits, we may take it 
for granted that an individual will be fit for the 
work as soon as we find out that he belongs to a 
group in which these required mental traits hab- 
itually occur. Such a judgment based on group 
psychology can of course be no more than a mere 
approach to a solution of the problem, as the psy- 
chical qualities may vary strongly in the midst of 
the group. The special individual may happen to 
129 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
   
   THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
stand at the extreme limit of the group, and the 
traits which are usually characteristic of it may be 
very little developed or entirely lacking in his spe- 
cial case. We may know that the inhabitants of a 
special country are rather alert, and yet the par- 
ticular individual with whom we have to deal may 
be clumsy and phlegmatic. The interests of econ- 
omy will, therefore, be served by such considera- 
tions of group psychology only if the employment, 
not of a single person, but of a large number, is in 
question, as it is most probable that the average 
character will show itself in a sufficient degree as 
soon as many members of the group are involved. 
Even in this case the presupposition ought to 
be that the average characteristics are found out 
with scientific exactitude by statistical and ex- 
perimental methods, and not that they are simply 
deduced from superficial impressions. I have 
found that just this race psychological diagnosis 
is frequently made in factories with great super- 
ficiality. Some of the American industrial centres 
offer extremely favorable conditions for the com- 
parative study of nationality. I have visited 
many manufacturing establishments in which al- 
most all workers are immigrants from foreign 
countries and in which up to twenty different 
nationalities are represented. The employment 
officers there easily develop some psychological 
130 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS 
  theories on the basis of which they are convinced 
that they are selecting the men with especial skill, 
knowing for each in which department he will be 
most successful. They consider it settled that for a 
particular kind of activity the Italians are the 
best, and for another, the Irish, and for a third, 
the Hungarians, and for a fourth, the Russian 
Jews. But as soon as these factory secrets have 
been revealed, you may be surprised to find that 
in the next factory a decidedly different classifica- 
tion of the wage-earners is in force. In a gigantic 
manufacturing concern, I received the definite 
information that the Swedish laborers are prefer- 
able wherever a steady eye is needed, and in an- 
other large factory on the same street I was as- 
sured that just the Swedes are unfit for such work. 
Sometimes this diversity of opinion is the result 
of different points of view. In one factory in 
which a certain industrial operation is rather dan- 
gerous, they told me that they took no southern 
Europeans, especially no Italians and Greeks, be- 
cause they are too hasty and careless in their 
movements, while they gladly filled the places 
with Irishmen. In a quite similar factory, on the 
other hand, they had a prejudice against the 
Trishmen alone for this work, because the Irish 
laborers are too willing to run a risk and to expose 
themselves to danger. Probably both psycho- 
131  
-P-A-G-E-144
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
logical observations are on the whole correct, but 
in the first factory only the one and in the second 
factory only the other was recognized. Much more 
thorough statistical inquiries than those which as 
yet exist, especially as to the actual differences of 
wages and piecework for wage-earners of various 
nationalities, would have to furnish a basis for 
such race psychological statements, until the time 
arrives when the psychological experiment comes 
to its own. 
In a similar way so far we have to rely on general 
theories of group psychology when the psycholog- 
ical differences of the sexes are to be reckoned 
with in economic interests. So long as laboratory 
methods for individual tests are not usual, the 
mental analysis of the general groups of men and 
women must form the background for indus- 
trial decisions. To be sure, it is not difficult to 
emphasize certain mental traits as characteristic 
of women in general in contrast to men in general, 
and to relate them to certain fundamental tenden- 
cies of their psychophysical organism. As soon 
as this is done, it is easy theoretically to deduce 
that certain industrial functions are excellently 
adapted to the minds of women and that certain 
others stand in striking antagonism to them. If 
the employment of large numbers is in question, 
and average values alone are involved, such a de- 
132
-P-A-G-E-145
  INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS 
cision on the basis of group psychology may be 
adequate. In most factories this vague sex psy- 
chology, to be sure, usually with a strong ad- 
mixture of wage questions, suggests for which 
machines men and for which women ought to be 
employed. But here again it is not at all im- 
probable that in the case of a particular woman the 
traditional group value may be entirely mislead- 
ing and the personality accordingly unfit for the 
place. Only the subtle psychological individual 
analysis can overcome the superficial prejudices 
of group psychology. The situation lies differently 
when problems of economic policy are before us. 
Such general policies as, for instance, colonial 
politics, or immigration politics, or politics con- 
cerned with city and rural communities, or with 
coast and mountain population, will always have 
to be based on group psychology as far as the eco- 
nomic problems are involved, inasmuch as they 
refer to the average and not to the individual 
differences. 
Finally, another indirect scheme to determine 
the personal qualities needed for economic effi- 
ciency may be suggested by the psychology of the 
typical correlations of human traits. We have 
seen that group psychology proclaims that a 
certain individual probably has certain traits be- 
cause he belongs to this or that nation or to this 
133
-P-A-G-E-146
  THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
or that otherwise well-known group. Correlation 
psychology proclaims that a particular individual 
possesses or does not possess certain traits be- 
cause he shows or does not show some other de- 
finite qualities. A correlation, for instance, which 
the commercial world often presupposes, may 
exist between individual traits and the hand-writ- 
ing. Graphologists are convinced that a certain 
loop or flourish, or the steepness or the length 
of the letters, or the position of the 7 dot, is a 
definite indication that the writer possesses cer- 
tain qualities of personality; and if just these 
qualities are essential requirements for the posi- 
tion, the impression of the handwriting in a letter 
may be taken as a sufficient basis for appoint- 
ment. The scientist has reason to look upon this 
particular case of graphological correlation with 
distrust. Yet even he may acknowledge that cer- 
tain correlations exist between the neatness, care- 
fulness, uniformity, energy, and similar features 
of the letter, and the general carefulness, steadi- 
ness, neatness, and energy of the personality. 
However, the laboratory psychologists nowa- 
days have gone far beyond such superficial claims 
for correlations of symptoms. With experimental 
and statistical methods they have gathered ample 
material which demonstrates the exact degree of 
probability with which we have a right to expect 
134
-P-A-G-E-147
    
INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS 
that certain qualities will occur together. Theo- 
retically we may take it for granted that those 
traits which are always present together or absent 
together ultimately have a common mental root. 
Yet practically they appear as two independent 
traits, and therefore it remains important to know 
that, if we can find one of them, we may be sure 
that the other will exist there too. Inasmuch as 
the one of the two traits may be easily detected, 
while the other may be hidden and can be found 
out only by long careful tests, it would be valu- 
able, indeed, for the employment manager to 
become acquainted with such correlations as the 
psychologist may discover: as soon as he becomes 
aware of the superficially noticeable symptom, 
he can foresee that the other disposition is most 
probably present. To give an illustration: in the 
interest of such measurements of correlations we 
have studied in the Harvard laboratory the vari- 
ous characteristics of attention and their mutual 
dependence.!® We found that typical connec- 
tions exist between apparently independent feat- 
ures of attention. Persons who have a rather 
expansive span of ‘attention for acoustical im- 
pressions have also a wide span for the visual 
objects. Persons whose attention is vivid and 
quick have on the whole the expansive type of at- 
tention, while those who attend slowly have a 
135 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
    THE BEST POSSIBLE MAN 
narrow field of attention, and so on. Hence the 
manifestation of one feature of attention allows 
us to presuppose without further tests that certain 
other features may be expected in the particular 
individual. 
The problem of attention, indeed, seems to 
stand quite in the centre of the field of indus- 
trial efficiency. This conviction has grown upon 
me in my observation of industrial life. The pe- 
culiar kind of attention decides more than any 
mental trait for which economic activity the indi- 
vidual is adapted. The essential point is that such 
differences of attention cannot be characterized 
as good or bad; it is not a question of the attentive 
and of the inattentive mind. One type is not bet- 
ter than another, but is simply different. Two 
workingmen, not only™equally industrious and 
capable, but also equally attentive, may yet oc- 
cupy two positions in which they are both com- 
plete failures because their attention does not fit 
the places, and both may become highly efficient 
as soon as they exchange positions. Their par- 
ticular types of attention have now found the 
right places. The one may be disposed to a strong 
concentration by which everything is inhibited

while at one point. If the one industrial activity 
demands the attentive observation of one little 
lever or one wheel at one point, while the other 
demands that half a dozen large machines be 
simultaneously supervised, all that is necessary 
is to find the man with the right type of atten- 
tion for each place. It would be utterly arbitrary 
to claim that the expansive type of attention is 
economically more or less valuable than the con- 
centrated type. Both in English and in German 
we have a long popular series of pamphlets with 
descriptions of the requirements and conditions 
for the various occupations to which a boy or a 
girl may turn, but I have nowhere found any re- 
ference to the most essential mental functions 
such as the particular kind of attention or mem- 
ory or will. These pamphlets are always cut after 
the same pattern. Where the detail refers at all 
to the mental side, it points only to particular 
knowledge which may be learned in school or 
trade or work, or to abilities which may be devel- 
oped by training. But the individual differences 
which are set by the particular conditions and 
dispositions of the mind are neglected with sur- 
prising uniformity in the vocational literature of 
all countries. The time seems ripe for at last filling 
this blank in the consciousness of the nation and 
in the institutions of the land.

E have placed our psychotechnical inter- 
est at the service of economic tasks. We 
therefore had to start from the various economic 
purposes and had to look backward, asking what 
ways might lead to these goals. All our studies 
so far were in this sense subordinated to the one 
task which ought to be the primary one in the 
economic world, and yet which has been most 
ignored. The purpose before us was to find for 
every economic occupation the best-fitted per- 
sonality, both in the interest of economic success 
and in the interest of personal development. In- 
dividual traits under this point of view become 
for us the decisive psychological factors, and ex- 
perimental psychology had to show us a method 
to determine those personal differences and their 
relation to the demands for industrial efficiency. 
This first goal may be reached with all the means 
of science, as we hope it will be in the future, or 
141
-P-A-G-E-154
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
everything may be left to unscientific, haphazard 
methods as in the past: in any case a second task 
stands before the community, namely, the securing 
of the best possible work from every man in his 
place. Indeed, the nation cannot delay the solu- 
tion of this second problem until the first has been 
solved in a satisfactory way. We might even say 
that the answer to the second question is themore 
important, the less satisfactory the answer to the 
first is. If every place in the economic world were 
filled only by those who are perfectly adapted by 
their mental traits, it would be much less difficult 
to get efficient work from every one. The fact that 
so many misfits are at work makes it such an 
urgent necessity to find ways and means by which 
the efficiency can be heightened. 
It must be acknowledged, however, that the 
problem of the best work is not quite such a clear 
one as that of the best man. From various stand- 
points a different answer may be given to the 
question which kind of work is the best. A capi- 
talistic, profit-seeking egotism may consider the 
quickest performance, or, if differences of quality 
are involved, the most skillful performance, the 
only desirable end. The social reformers, on the 
other hand, may consider the best work that which 
combines the greatest and best possible output 
with the highest possible saving of the organism 
142
-P-A-G-E-155
LEARNING AND TRAINING 
and the fullest development of the personality. 
We have emphasized from the start that the 
practical psychologist as such has not the right 
to give a decision upon problems of social civiliza- 
tion. He has to accept the economic tasks from 
the community for which he is working and his 
impartial service commences only when the goals 
have been determined. It is not his share to se- 
lect the ends, but simply to determine the means 
after the valuable ends have been chosen. As a 
psychological scientist he has not the right to en- 
ter into the arena of different social party fights. 
Yet we find after all a broad region which seems 
rather untouched by any conflict of reasonable 
opinions. A reckless capitalism on the one side 
and a feeble sentimentality on the other side may 
try to widen or to narrow the boundaries of this 
region, but taken all together, a vigorous healthy 
nation which is eagerly devoted to its work is on 
the whole in agreement as to the essential econo- 
mic demands for efficient labor. 
Experience, to be sure, shows that great changes 
in the conditions of work can never enter into the 
history of civilization without certain disturb- 
ances, and that opposition must therefore neces- 
sarily arise in certain groups even against such 
changes as are undoubtedly improvements and 
advances from the point of view of the whole na- 
143
-P-A-G-E-156
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
tion. Such dissatisfaction arose when the factory 
system was introduced, and it is only natural that 
some irritation should accompany the introduc- 
tion of psychological improvements in the methods 
of work, inasmuch as not a few wage-earners may 
at first have to lose their places because a small 
number of men will under the improved conditions 
be sufficient for the performance of tasks which 
needed many before. But the history of econo- 
mics has clearly shown that from the point of view 
of the whole community such an apparent dis- 
turbance has always been only temporary. If the 
psychologists succeed in fundamentally improving 
the conditions of labor, the increased efficiency of 
the individual will promote such an enriched and 
vivified economic life that ultimately an increase 
in the number of laborers needed will result. The 
inquiry into the possible psychological contribu- 
tions to the question of reinforced achievement 
must not be deterred by the superficial objection 
that in one or another industrial concern a dis- 
missal of wage-earners might at first result. Psy- 
chotechnics does not stand in the service of a party, 
but exclusively in the service of civilization. 
To begin at the beginning, we may start from 
the commonplace that every form of economic 
labor in the workshop and in the factory, in the 
field and in the mine, in the store and in the office, 
144
-P-A-G-E-157
  LEARNING AND TRAINING 
must first be learned. How far do the experi- 
ments of the psychologist offer suggestions for 
securing the most economic method of learning 
practical activities ? Bodily actions in the service 
of economic work are taught and learned in hun- 
dreds of thousands of places. It is evident that 
one method of teaching must reach the goal more 
quickly and more reliably than another. Some 
methods of teaching must therefore be econom- 
ically more advantageous, and yet on the whole 
the methods of teaching muscular work are es- 
sentially left to chance. It is indeed not difficult 
to observe how factory workers or artisans have 
learned the same complex motion according to en- 
tirely different methods. The result is that they 
carry out the various partial movements in a dif- 
ferent order, or with different auxiliary motions, 
or in different positions, or in a different rhythm, 
or with different emphasis, simply because they 
imitate different teachers, and because no norm, 
no certainty as to the best methods for the teach- 
ing, has been determined. But the process of 
learning is still more fluctuating and still more de- 
pendent upon chance than the process of teach- 
ing. The apprentice approaches the instruction in 
any chance way, and the beginner usually learns 
even the first steps with a psychophysical attitude 
which is left to accident. An immense waste of 
145
-P-A-G-E-158
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
energy and a quite anti-economic training in 
unfit movements is the necessary result. 
The learning of the elements of school know- 
ledge in the classroom in earlier times proceeded 
after exactly such chance methods. Any one who 
knew how to read, write, and calculate felt him- 
self prepared to pour reading, writing, and arith- 
metic into the unprotected children. Methods 
which are based on scientific examination of the 
psychophysical process of reading and writing 
were not at the disposal of the schools, and exact 
results from comparative studies of pedagogical 
methods had not been secured. The last few de- 
cades have created an entirely new foundation for 
enlightened school work. The experimental in- 
vestigations of pedagogical psychology have de- 
termined exactly how the consciousness of the 
child reacts on the various methods of teaching 
and have built up a real systematic economic 
learning. All which was left to dilettantic ca- 
price has been transformed into more or less 
definite standard forms. For instance, the old 
scheme of teaching reading by the alphabet 
method is practically eliminated from our mod- 
ern schools. It is clear that this learning of the 
names of the single letters as a starting-point for 
the reading of words was not only a wasting of 
time and energy, but an actual disturbance in the 
146
-P-A-G-E-159
  
LEARNING AND TRAINING 
development of the reading process in the older 
generation. As those names of the letters do not 
occur at all in the words to be read, but only their 
sounds, what had been learned in seeing the single 
letters had to be inhibited in pronouncing the 
whole word. It seems not too much to say that 
the learning of industrial activities on the whole 
still stands on the level of such alphabet methods, 
and this cannot be otherwise, as the real problem, 
namely, the systematic investigation of the psy- 
chophysical activities involved, has ‘never been 
brought into the psychological laboratory. 
The pedagogical experiment has shown clearly 
enough that the subjective feeling of easier or 
quicker learning may be entirely unreliable and 
misleading. If the task is to learn a page by heart, 
we may proceed after many different methods. We 
may learn very small fractions of the text, re- 
peating only a few words, or we may read whole 
paragraphs every time; we may repeat the whole 
material again and again, or we may put in long 
periods of rest after a few repetitions; we may 
frequently recite it from memory and have some 
one to prompt us; we may give our attention es- 
pecially to the meaning of the words, or merely 
to the sounds, or we may introduce any number 
of similar variations. Now the careful experi- 
ment shows that of two such methods one which 
147 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  
THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
appears to us the better and more appropriate in 
learning, perhaps even as the easier and more 
comfortable, may prove itself the less efficient one 
in the practical result. The psychology of learn- 
ing, which won its success by introducing mean- 
ingless syllables as experimental “material, has 
slowly determined the most reliable methods for 
impressing knowledge on memory. Where such 
results have once been secured, it would surely 
be a grave mistake simply to stick to the methods 
of so-called common sense and to leave it to the 
caprice of the individual teacher to decide what 
method of learning he will suggest to his pupils. 
The best method is always the only one which 
should be considered. The psychology of economic 
work must aim toward similar goals. We must 
secure a definite knowledge as to the methods by 
which a group of movements can best be learned. 
We must understand what value is to be attached 
to the repetitions and to the pauses, to the imita- 
tions and to the special combinations of! move- 
ments, to the exercise in parts of the movements, 
to the rhythm of the work, and to many similar 
influences which may shape the learning process. 
The simplest aspect, that of the mere repeti- 
tion of the movement, has frequently been ex- 
amined by psychophysicists. The real founder 
of experimental psychology, Fechner, showed the 
148
-P-A-G-E-161
  
LEARNING AND TRAINING 
way; he performed fatiguing experiments with 
lifted dumb-bells. Then came the time in which 
the laboratories began to make a record of the 
muscular activities with the help of the ergo- 
graph, an instrument with which the movements 
of the arm and the fingers can easily be registered 
on the smoked surface of a revolving drum. The 
subtlest variations of the activity, the increase 
and decrease of the psychomotor impulse, the 
mental fatigue, can be traced exactly in such 
graphic records. This psychomotor side of the 
process, and not the mere muscle activity as such, 
is indeed the essential factor which should interest 
us. The results of exercise are a training of the 
central apparatus of the brain and not of the mus- 
cular periphery. The further development of those 
experiments soon led to complex questions, which 
referred not only to the mere change in the motor 
efficiency, but to the learning of particular groups 
of movements and to the influences on the ex- 
actitude and reliability of the movements. The 
purely mental factors of the will-impulse, espe- 
cially the consciousness of the task, came into the 
foreground. These experiences of the scientists 
concerning the influences of training, the mechan- 
ization of repetition, and the automatization of 
movements have been thoroughly discussed by 
a brilliant political economist !° as an explana- 
149 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
tion of certain industrial facts, but they have 
not yet practically influenced life in the factory. 
The nearest approach from the experimental 
side to the study of the effect of training in actual 
industrial tasks may be found in certain labora- 
tory investigations which refer to the learning 
of telegraphing, typewriting, and so on. For 
instance, we have a careful study ”° of the pro- 
gress made in learning telegraphy, both as to the 
transmitting of the telegrams by the key move- 
ment and the receiving of the telegrams by the 
ear. It was found that the rapidity of trans- 
mitting increases more rapidly and more uni- 
formly than the rapidity of receiving. But while 
the curve of the latter rises more slowly and more 
irregularly, it finally reaches the greater height. 
The ability in transmitting, represented by a 
graphic record, shows an ascent which corre- 
sponds to the typical, steady curve of training. In 
the receiving curve, on the other hand, we find 
not far from the beginning a characteristic period 
during which no progress whatever can be no- 
ticed, and this is also repeated at a later stage. 
The psychological analysis shows that the in- 
crease of ability in the receiving of telegrams de- 
pends upon the development of a complex system 
of psychophysical habits. The periods in which 
the curve does not ascend represent stages of 
150
-P-A-G-E-163
  LEARNING AND TRAINING 
training in which the elementary habits are almost 
completely formed, but have not become suffi- 
ciently automatic. The attention is therefore not 
yet ready to start habits of a higher order. The lowest correlation refers to the single letters, after 
that to the syllables and words. As soon as the ap- 
prentice has reached this point, he stops, because 
he must learn to master more and more new words 
until his telegraphic vocabulary is large enough 
to make it possible for him to turn his conscious- 
ness to whole groups of words at once. Only when 
this new habit has been made automatic by a training of several months can he advance toa 
level at which whole groups of words are perceived 
as telegraphic units. A time follows in which this mastery of whole phrases advances rapidly, until 
a new period of rest comes, from which, only after 
years and often quite suddenly, a last new ascent 
can be noticed. Instead of concentrating the at- 
tention with conscious strain on single phrases, 
the operator progresses to a perfect liberty in 
which whole sentences are understood automat- 
ically. 
We also have a model experimental research 
into the psychological conditions of learning in 
the case of writing on a typewriter.”! By electrical 
connections between the typewriting machine 
and a system of levers which registered their 
151
-P-A-G-E-164
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
movements on the rotating drum of a kymo- 
graph, each striking of a key, each completion of 
a word, or of a line, could be recorded in exact 
time-relations. Each glance at the copy was also 
registered. It was found that the process of learn- 
ing consisted first of a continuous simplification of 
the cumbersome methods with which the beginner 
commences. A steady elimination of unfit move- 
ments, a selection, a reorganization, and finally, 
a combination of psychophysical acts to impulses 
of higher order, could betraced exactly. Here, too, 
the curve of learning at first rises quickly and 
then more and more slowly. Of course the usual 
fluctuations in the growth of the ability can also 
be found, and above all the irregular periods of 
rest in which the learning itself does not progress, 
for some of these so-called plateaus which lie be- 
tween the end of one ascent and the beginning of 
the next may cover a month and more. At 
the beginning we have the elementary association 
between the single letter and the position of the 
corresponding key, but soon an immediate con- 
nection between the visual impression of the 
whole syllable or the whole word and the total 
group of movements necessary to strike the keys 
for it is developed. The more the ability grows, 
the more these psychical impulses of higher order 
become organized without conscious intention. 
152
-P-A-G-E-165
  LEARNING AND TRAINING 
The study shows that this development of higher 
habits has already begun before the lower habits 
are fully settled. 
How far the special training involves at the 
same time a general training which could be of 
advantage for other kinds of labor has not yet 
been studied at all with reference to industrial tech- 
nique. There we are still completely dependent 
upon certain experiences in the field of experi- 
mental pedagogy, and upon certain statistics, for 
instance, in the textile industry. Many patient 
investigations, with every independent group of 
apparatus and machines, may be necessary before 
psychotechnics will be able to supply industry 
with reliable advice for teaching and learning. Nor 
have we the least right hastily to carry over the 
results from one group of movements to another. 
Even where superficially a certain similarity 
between the technical factors exists, the psycho- 
physical conditions may be essentially differ- 
ent. In the two cases mentioned, for instance, 
telegraphing and typewriting, the chief factor 
seems the same, as in both cases the aim is to 
make the quickest possible finger movements for 
purposes of signals; and yet it is not surprising 
that the development of the ability from the be- 
ginnings to the highest mastery is rather unlike, 
as all the movements in telegraphing are per- 
153
-P-A-G-E-166
THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
formed with the same finger, while in typewriting 
the chief trait is the organization of groups from 
the impulses to all ten fingers. At least it is cer- 
tain that learning always means far more than 
a mere facilitation of the movement by mechan- 
ical repetition, and this is true of the simplest 
handling of the tools in the workshop, of the 
movements at the machine in the factory, and of 
the most complex performances at the subtlest in- 
struments. The chief factor in the development is 
always the organization of the impulses by which 
the reactions which are at first complicated be- 
come simplified, later mechanized, and finally 
synthesized into a higher group which becomes 
subordinated to one simple psychical impulse. 
The most reliable and psychophysically most eco- 
nomic means for this organization will have to be 
studied in the economic psychological laborato- 
ries of the future for every particular technique. 
Then only can the enormous waste of psychical 
energy resulting from haphazard methods be 
brought to an end. 
A problem which is still too little considered 
in industrial life is the mutual interference of ac- 
quired technical activities. If one connected series 
of movements is well trained by practice, does it 
become less firmly fixed, if another series is stud- 
ied in which the same beginning is connected with 
154
-P-A-G-E-167
  LEARNING AND TRAINING 
another path of discharge? I approached this psy- 
chophysical question of learning by experiments 
which I carried on for a long while with variations 
of ordinary habits of daily life, asking whether a 
habit associated with a certain sensory stimulus 
can function automatically while dispositions for 
a different habit, previously acquired, remain in 
the psychophysical system. For instance, I was 
accustomed to carry my watch in my left-hand 
vest pocket. For a week I carried it in the right- 
hand pocket of my trousers and recorded every 
case in which I first automatically made the move- 
ment to the vest. After some time the movement 
to the right-hand pocket became entirely auto- 
matic. When it was sufficiently fixed, I again put 
the watch in the left-hand vest pocket and re- 
corded how often I unconsciously grasped at the 
right side when I wanted to see what time it was. 
As soon as the vest pocket movement had again 
become fixed, I went back to the right-hand trou- 
sers pocket. And so I alternated for a long while, 
always changing only after reaching complete 
automatism. But the results in this case and in 
other similar experiments which I carried on 
showed that the new automatic connection did 
not extinguish the after effects of the previous 
habit. With every new change the number of 
wrong movements became smaller and smaller, 
155 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
and finally a point was reached at which the 
dispositions for both movements were equally 
developed so that no wrong movements oc- 
curred when the watch was put into the new 
position.?? 
This problem has been followed up very re- 
cently in a valuable investigation at Columbia 
University, in which various habits of type- 
writing and of card-sorting were acquired and 
studied in their mutual interference. These very 
careful experiments also show that when two 
opposing associations are alternately practiced, 
they have an interference effect on each other, 
but that the interference grows less and less as the 
practice effect becomes greater. The interference 
effect is gradually overcome and both’ opposing 
associations become automatic, so that either of 
them can be called up independently without the 
appearance of the other. Many details of the 
research suggest that this whole group of inter- 
ference problems deserves the most careful at- 
tention by those who would practically profit 
from increased industrial efficiency. 
Finally, in the experimental study of the pro- 
blem of technical learning, we cannot ignore the 
many side influences which may hasten or delay, 
improve or disturb, the acquisition of industrial 
skill. In the Harvard laboratory, for instance, we 
156
-P-A-G-E-169
LEARNING AND TRAINING 
are at present engaged in an investigation which 
deals with the influence of feelings on the rapidity 
with which new movement codrdinations are 
mastered.*4 In order to have unlimited compar- 
able material a very simple technical performance 
is required, namely, the distribution of the 52 
playing-cards into 52 boxes. Labels on the boxes 
indicate changing combinations for the distri- 
bution to be learned. We examine, on the one 
side, the influence of feelings of comfort or of dis- 
comfort on the learning of the new habit, these 
feeling states being produced by external condi- 
tions, such as pleasant or unpleasant sounds, 
odors, and so on. On the other side we trace the 
effects of those feelings which arise during the 
learning process itself, such as feelings of satisfac- 
tion with progress, or disappointment, or discom- 
fort, or disgust or joy in the activity.

THE ADJUSTMENT OF TECHNICAL TO 
PSYCHICAL CONDITIONS 
EACHING and learning represent only the 
preliminary problem. The fundamental 
question remains, after all, how the work is to be 
done by those who have learned it in accordance 
with the customs of the economic surroundings and 
who are accordingly already educated and trained 
for it. What can be done to eliminate everything 
which diminishes and decreases efficiency, and 
what remains to be done to reinforce it. Such 
influences are evidently exerted by the external 
technical conditions, by variations of the activity 
itself, and by the play of the psychical motives 
and counter-motives. It must seem as if only this 
last factor would belong in the realm of psycho- 
logy, but the technical conditions, of which the 
machine itself is the most important part, and the 
bodily movements also have manifold relations 
to the psychical life. Only as far as these relations 
prevail has the psychologist ahy reason to study 
the problem. The purely physical and economic 
factors of technique do not interest him at all, but 
when atechnical arrangement makes a psychophy- 
158
-P-A-G-E-171
  
  THE ADJUSTMENT OF CONDITIONS 
sical achievement more difficult or more easy, it 
belongs in the sphere of the psychologist, and just 
_ this aspect of the work may become of greatest im- 
portance for the total result. In all three of these 
directions, that is, with reference to the technical, 
to the physiological, and to the purely psychical, 
the scientific management movement has pre- 
pared the way. The engineers of scientific man- 
agement recognized, at least, that no part of the 
industrial process is indifferent; even the appar- 
ently most trivial activity, the slightest move- 
ment of arm or hand or leg, became the object of 
their exact measurement. The stopwatch which 
measures every movement in fractions of a second 
has become the symbol of this new economic 
period. As long as special psychological experi- 
ments in the service of industrial psychology are 
still so exceptional, it may, indeed, be acknow- 
ledged that the practical experiments in the serv- 
ice of scientific management have come nearest 
to the solution of these special psychotechnical 
problems. 
To proceed from without toward the centre, we 
may begin our review with the physical technique 
of the working conditions and its relations to 
the mind. The history of technique shows on’ 
every page this practical adjustment of external 
labor conditions to the psychophysical necessities 
159
-P-A-G-E-172
  
THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
and psychophysical demands. No machine with 
which a human being is to work can survive in the 
struggle for technical existence, unless it is to a 
certain degree adapted to the human nerve and 
muscle system and to man’s possibilities of per- 
ception, of attention, of memory, of feeling, and 
of will. Industrial technique with its restless im- 
provements has always been subordinated to this 
postulate. Every change which made it possible 
for the workingman to secure equal effects with 
smaller effort or to secure greater or better effects 
with equal effort counted as an economic gain, 
which was welcome to the market. For instance, 
throughout the history of industry we find the 
fundamental tendency to transpose all activities 
from the great muscles to the small muscles. Any 
activity which is performed with the robust mus- 
cles of the shoulder when it can be done with the 
lower arm, or labor which is demanded from the 
muscles of the lower arm when it can just as well 
be carried out by the fingers, certainly involves 
a waste of psychophysical energy. A stronger 
psychophysical excitement is necessary in order to 
secure the innervation of the big muscles in the 
central nervoussystem. This difference in the stim- 
ulation of the various muscle groups has been of 
significant consequence for the differentiation of 
work throughout the development of mankind.®® 
160
-P-A-G-E-173
  THE ADJUSTMENT OF CONDITIONS 
Labor with the large muscles has, for these 
psychophysical reasons, never been easily com- 
bined with the subtler training of the finer mus- 
cles. Hence a social organization which obliged 
the men to give their energy to war and the hunt, 
both, in primitive life, functions of the strongest 
muscles, made it necessary for the domestic activ- 
ities, which are essentially functions of the small 
muscles, to be carried out by women. The whole 
history of the machine demonstrates this econo- 
mic tendency to make activities dependent upon 
those muscles which presuppose the smallest 
psychophysical effort. It is not only the smaller 
effort which gives economic advantage to the 
stimulation of the smaller muscles, but the no less 
important circumstance that the psychophysical 
after-effect of their central excitement exerts less 
inhibition than the after-effect of the brain excite- 
ment for the big muscles. 
But. we must not overlook another feature in 
the development of technique. The machines 
have been constantly transformed in the direc- 
tion which made it possible to secure the greatest 
help from the natural codrdination of bodily 
movements. The physiological organization and 
the psychophysical conditions of the nervous 
system make it necessary that the movement im- 
pulses flow over into motor side channels and thus 
161
-P-A-G-E-174
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
produce accessory effects without any special 
effort. If a machine is so constructed that these 
natural accessory movements must be artificially 
and intentionally suppressed, it means, on the 
one side, a waste of available psychophysical 
energy, and on the other side it demands a useless 
effort inorder to secure this inhibition. The indus- 
trial development has moved toward both the 
fructification of those side impulses and the avoid- 
ance of these inhibitions. It has adjusted itself 
practically to the natural psychical conditions. 
Ultimately it is this tendency which shaped the 
technical apparatus for the economic work until 
the muscle movements could become rhythmical. 
The rhythmical activity necessarily involves a 
psychophysical saving and this saving has been 
instinctively secured throughout the history of 
civilization. All rhythm contains a repetition 
of movement without making a real repetition of 
the psychophysical impulse necessary. In the 
_ rhythmical activity a large part of the first ex- 
citement still serves for the second, and the sec- 
ond for the third. Inhibitions fall away and the 
mere after-effect of each stimulus secures a great 
saving for the new impulse. The history of the 
machine even indicates that the newer technical 
development not only found the far-reaching 
division of labor already in the workshops of 
162
-P-A-G-E-175
  
THE ADJUSTMENT OF CONDITIONS 
earlier centuries, but a no less far-reaching rhyth- 
mization of the labor in fine adaptation to theneeds 
of the psychophysical organism, long before the 
appearance of the machines. The beginnings of 
the machine period frequently showed nothing 
but an imitation of the rhythmical movements 
of man.” To be sure, the later improvements 
of the machine have frequently destroyed that 
original rhythm of man’s movement, as the move- 
ment itself, especially in the electric machines, 
has become so quick that the subjective rhyth- 
mical experience has been lost. Moreover, the 
rhythmical horizontal and vertical movements 
were for physical reasons usually replaced by 
uniform circular movements. But even the most 
highly developed machine demands human activ- 
ity, for instance, for the supplying with material; 
and this again has opened new possibilities for the 
adjustment of technical mechanism to the eco- 
nomic demand for rhythmical muscle activity. 
The growth of technical devices has thus been 
constantly under the control of psychological de- 
mands, in spite of the absence of systematic psy- 
chological investigations. But the decisive factor 
was, indeed, that these psychological motives 
always remained in the subconsciousness of civil- 
ization. The improvements were consciously re- 
ferred to the machine as such, however much the 
163

practical success was really influenced by the de- 
gree of its adjustment to the mental conditions of 
the workingmen. The new movements of scien- 
tific management and of experimental psycho- 
logy aim toward bringing this adaptation con- 
sciously into the foreground and toward testing 
and studying systematically what technical vari- 
ations can best suit the psychophysical status of 
man. 
Those who are familiar with the achievements 
of scientific management remember that by no 
means only the complicated procedures on a high 
level are in question. The successes are often the 
most surprising where the technique is old, and 
where it might have been imagined that the ex- 
periences of many centuries would have secured 
through mere common sense the most effective 
performance. The best-known case is perhaps 
that of the masons, which one of the leaders of the 
scientific management movement has studied in 
all its details.27 The movements of the build- 
ers and the tools which they use were examined 
with scientific exactitude and slowly reshaped 
under the point of view of psychology and physi- 
ology. The total result was that after the new 
method 30 masons completed without greater 
fatigue what after the old methods it would have 
taken 100 masons to do, and that the total ex- 
164
-P-A-G-E-177
  THE ADJUSTMENT OF CONDITIONS 
pense for the building was reduced to less than a 
half in spite of the steady increase of the wages 
of the laborers. For this purpose it was necessary 
that exact measurements be made of the height 
at which the bricks were lying and of the height of 
the wall on which they must be laid, and of the 
number of bricks which should be carried to the 
masons at once. He studied how the trowel 
should be shaped and how the mortar should be 
used and how the bricks should be carried to the 
bricklayers. In short, everything which usually 
is left to tradition, to caprice, and to an economy 
which looks out only for the most immediate sav- 
ing, was on the basis of experiments of many years 
replaced by entirely new means and tools, where 
nothing was left to arbitrariness. Yet these 
changes did not demand ty invention or phys- 
ically or economically new i eas, but merely a 
more careful adaptation of the apparatus to the 
psychological energies of the masons. The new 
arrangement permitted a better organization of 
the necessary bodily movements, fatigue was 
diminished, the accessory movements were better 
fructified, fewer inhibitions were necessary, a bet- 
ter playing together of the psychical energies 
was secured. 
The students of scientific management stepped 
still lower in the scale of economic activity. There 
165

is no more ordinary productive function than 
shoveling. Yet in great establishments the shovel- 
ing of coal or of dirt may represent an econom- 
ically very important factor. It seems that up to 
the days of scientific management, no one really 
looked carefully into the technical conditions 
under which the greatest possible economic ef- 
fect might be reached. Now the act of shoveling 
was approached with the carefulness with which a 
scholar turns to any subtle process in his labora- 
tory. The brilliant originator of the scientific 
management movement, who carried out these 
investigations 2° in the great Bethlehem Steel 
Works, where hundreds of laborers had to shovel 
heavy iron ore or light ashes, found that the usual 
chance methods involve an absurd economic 
waste. The burden was sometimes so heavy that 
rapid fatigue developed and the movements be- 
came too slow, or the lifted mass was so light that 
the larger part of the laborer’s energies remained 
unused. In either case the final result of the day’s 
work must be anti-economic. He therefore tested 
with carefully graded experiments what weight en- 
sured the most favorable achievement by a strong 
healthy workingman. The aim was to find the 
weight which would secure with well-arranged 
pauses the maximum product in one day without 
over-fatigue. As soon as this weight was deter- 
166
-P-A-G-E-179
  THE ADJUSTMENT OF CONDITIONS 
mined, aspecial set of shovels had tobe constructed 
for every particular kind of material. The la- 
borers were now obliged to operate with 10 dif- 
ferent kinds of shovels, each of such a size that 
the burden always remained an average of 21 
pounds for any kind of material. The following 
step was an exact determination of the most favor- 
able rapidity and the most perfect movement of 
shoveling, the best distribution of pauses, and so 
on, and the final outcome was that only 140 men 
were needed where on the basis of the old plan 
about 500 laborers had been engaged. The aver- 
age workingman who had previously shoveled 16 
tons of material, now managed 59 tons without 
greater fatigue. The wages were raised by two 
thirds and the expenses for shoveling a ton of 
material were decreased one half. 'This calculation 
of expenses included, of course, a consideration of 
the increased cost for tools and for the salaries 
of the scientific managers. 
Whoever visits factories in which the new sys- 
tem has been introduced by real specialists must 
be surprised, indeed, by the great effects which 
often result from the better psychophysical adap- 
tation of the simplest and apparently most in- 
different tools and means. As far as the compli- 
cated machines are concerned, we are accustomed 
to a steady improvement by the efforts of the 
167
-P-A-G-E-180
THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
technicians and we notice it rather little if the 
changes in them are introduced for psychological 
instead of the usual physical reasons. But the fact 
that even the least complicated and most indif- 
ferent devices can undergo most influential im- 
provements, as soon as they are seriously studied 
from a psychological point of view, remains really 
a source for surprise. Sometimes no more is 
needed than a change in the windows or in the 
electric lamps, by which the light can fall on the 
work in a psychologically satisfactory way; some- 
times long series of experiments have to be made 
with a simple hammer or knife or table. Often 
everything must be arranged against the wishes 
of the workingmen, who feel any deviation from 
the accustomed conditions as a disturbance which 
is to be regarded with suspicion. In one concern 
I heard that the scientific manager became con- 
vinced that all the working-chairs for the women 
were too low and that the laborers therefore had 
to hold their arms in a psychophysically unfavor- 
able position during the handling of theapparatus. _ 
All were strongly opposed to the introduction of 
higher chairs. The result was that the manager 
arranged for the chairs to be raised a few milli- 
meters every evening, without the knowledge of 
the working-women, as soon as the factory was 
empty. After a few weeks the chairs had reached 
168
-P-A-G-E-181
  THE ADJUSTMENT OF CONDITIONS 
the right height without those engaged in the work 
having noticed it at all. The outcome was a de- 
cided increase of efficiency. 
But the most rational scheme will after all be 
to prepare for such arrangements of tools and 
apparatus by systematic experiments in the 
psychological laboratory. The subtlety of such 
investigations will lead far beyond the point 
which is accessible to the attempts of scientific 
management. Exact experiments on attention, 
for instance, will have to determine how the va- 
rious parts of the apparatus are to be distributed 
best in space if the laborer must keep watch for 
disturbances at various places. Only the labora- 
tory experiment can find the most favorable 
speed of the machine or can select the muscles to 
which the mind can send the most effective im- 
pulses. The construction of the machine must 
then be adapted to such results. In the Har- 
vard laboratory, for instance, a practical question 
led us to examine which fingers would allow 
the quickest alternation of key movements,” 
If any two of the ten fingers perform for ten 
seconds the quickest possible alternation of mo- 
tion, as in a trill, the experiment can demon- 
strate exactly the differences between the various 
combinations of fingers and the individual fluc- 
tuations for these differences. With an electrical 
169

THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
registration of the movements of the alternating 
fingers we studied in hundredths of a second 
the time for the motions of two hands and of 
fingers of the same hand, in order to adjust the 
keys of a certain machine to the most favorable 
impulses. 
We approach this group of problems from an- 
other side when we test the relations of various 
kinds of machines to various mental types. Psy- 
chologists have studied, for example, the various 
styles of typewriting machines.*° From a purely 
commercial point of view the merits of one or an- 
other machine are praised as if they were advan- 
tageous for every possible human being. The 
fact is that such advantages for one may be 
disadvantages for another on account of differ- 
ences in the mental disposition. One man may 
write more quickly on one, another on another 
machine. As every one knows, the chief differ- 
ence is that of the keyboard and that of the visible 
or invisible writing. Machines like the Reming- 
ton machine work with a shift key; that is, a 
special key must be pressed when capital letters 
are to be written. Other machines like the 
Oliver even demand double shifting, one key for 
the capital letters, and one for the figures, and so 
on. On the other hand, machines like the Smith 
Premier have no shift key, but a double keyboard. 
170
-P-A-G-E-183
  
THE ADJUSTMENT OF CONDITIONS 
It is evident that both the shift-key arrangement 
and the double keyboard have their particular 
psychological advantages. 
The single alphabet demands much less from 
the optical memory, and the corresponding motor 
inner attitude of consciousness is adjusted to a 
smaller number of possibilities. But the pressure 
on the shift key, which goes with the single al- 
phabet, is not only a time-wasting act; from the 
psychological point of view it is first of all a very 
strong interruption of the uniform chain of im- 
pulses. If the capital and small letters are writ- 
ten for a minute alternatingly with the greatest 
possible speed, the experiment shows that the 
number of letters for the machine with the 
double alphabet is about three times greater than 
for the machine with simple alphabet and shift 
key. Both systems accordingly have their psy- 
chological advantages and disadvantages. Hu- 
man beings of distinct visual ideational type or of 
highly developed motor type will prefer the double 
alphabet, provided, of course, that the touch sys- 
tem of writing is learned, and this will be espe- 
cially true if their inner attitude is easily disturbed 
by interruptions. But those who have a feebly 
developed optical mental centre and who have 
small ability for the development of complex 
motor habits will be more efficient on the ma- 
171 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
    
THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
chines with the single alphabet, especially if their 
nervous system is little molested by interruptions 
and thus undisturbed by the intrusion of the shift 
key act. 
In a similar way the visibility of the writing 
will be for certain individuals the most valuable 
condition for quick writing, while for others, who 
depend less upon visual support, it may mean 
rather a distraction and an interference with the 
speediest work. The visible writing attracts the 
involuntary attention, and thus forces conscious- 
ness to stick to that which has been written in- 
stead of being concentrated on that which is to 
be produced by the next writing movements. The 
operator himself is not aware of this hindrance. 
On the contrary, the public will always be in- 
clined to prefer the typewriters with visible writ- 
ing, because by a natural confusion the feeling 
arises that the production of the letter is some- 
what facilitated, when the eye is codperating, 
just as in writing with a pen we follow the lines 
of the written letter. But the situation lies differ- 
ently in the two cases. When we are writing with 
a pen, the letter grows under our eyes, while in 
the machine writing we do not see any part of 
the letter until the whole movement which pro- 
duces the single letter is finished. By such a mis- 
leading analogy many a man is led to prefer the 
172’

typewriter with visible writing, while he would 
probably secure a greater speed with a machine 
which does not tempt him to attend the completed 
letters, while his entire attention ought to belong 
to the following letters. 
These last observations point to another psy- 
chological aspect of the machine and of the whole 
technical work, namely, their relations to the 
impressions of the senses. The so-called dynamo- 
genic experiments of the psychological laboratory 
have demonstrated what a manifold influence 
flows from the sense-impressions to the will- 
impulses. If the muscle contraction of a man’s 
fist is measured, the experiment shows that the 
strongest possible pressure may be very different 
when the visual field appears in different colors, 
or tones of different pitch or different noises are 
stimulating the ear, and so on. As yet no sys- 
tematic experiments exist by which such results 
can be brought into relation to the sense-stimuli 
which reach the laborer during his technical work. 
The psychophysical effect of colors and noises has 
not been fructified at all for industrial purposes. 
The mere subjective judgment of the working- 
man himself cannot be acknowledged as reliable 
in such questions. The laborer, for instance, usu- 
ally believes that a noise to which he has become 
accustomed does not disturb him in his work, 
173
-P-A-G-E-186
ee ee Lene ne 
THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
while experimental results point strongly to the 
contrary. In a similar way the effect of colored 
windows may appear indifferent to the workmen, 
and yet may have considerable influence on his 
efficiency. Numberless performances in the fac- 
tory are reactions on certain optical or acoustical 
or tactual signals. Both the engineer and the 
workman are satisfied if such a signal is clearly 
perceivable. The psychological laboratory experi- 
ment, however, shows that the whole psycho- 
physical effect depends upon the character of the 
signal; a more intense light, a quicker change, 
a higher tone, a larger field of light, a louder noise, 
or a harder touch may produce a very different 
kind of reaction. 
With a careful time-measurement of the mo- 
tions, it can often be directly traced how purely 
technical processes in the machine itself influence 
and control the whole psychical system of im- 
pulses in the man. I observed, in a factory, for 
instance, the work at a machine which performed 
most of its functions automatically. It had to 
hammer fine grooves into small metal plates. A 
young laborer stood before every such machine, 
took from a pile, alternately from the right and 
from the left, the little plates to be serrated, 
placed them in the machine, turned a lever to 
bring the hammer into motion, and then removed 
174  
-P-A-G-E-187
  
THE ADJUSTMENT OF CONDITIONS 
the serrated plates. The speed of the work was 
dependent upon the operative, as he determined 
by his lever movement the instant at which the 
automatic serrating hammer should be released. 
The man’s activity demanded 9 independent 
movements. I found that those who worked the 
most quickly were able to carry out this labor for 
hours at a uniform rapidity of 4 to 43 seconds for 
those 9 movements. But the time-measurement 
showed that even these fastest workers were re- 
latively slow in the first 5 movements which they 
made while the machine stood quiet, and that 
they reached an astonishing quickness of move- 
ment in the 4 last actions during which at the 
same time the serrating hammer in bewildering 
rapidity was beating on the plate with sharp loud 
cracks. The hammer reinforced the energy of the 
young laborers to an effectiveness which could 
never have been attained by mere voluntary 
effort. 
Often the simplicity or complication of the 
stimulus may be decisive in importance, and this 
also holds true where the most elementary re- 
actions are involved, for instance, the mere act 
of counting which enters into many industrial 
functions. Experiments carried on in my lab- 
oratory *! have shown that the time needed to 
count a certain number of units becomes longer 
175 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
as soon as the units themselves become more 
complicated. Their inner manifoldness exerts a 
retarding influence on the eye as it moves from 
one figure to another. A certain psychical in- 
hibition arises; the mind is held back by the com- 
plexity of the impression and cannot proceed 
quickly enough to the next. Psychologically no 
less important is the demand that the external 
technical conditions so far as they influence con- 
sciousness, should remain as far as possible the 
same, if the same psychical effect is desired, be- 
cause then only can a perfectly firm connection 
between stimulus and movement be formed. In 
technical life this demand is much sinned against. 
A typical case is that of the signals for which the 
engineer on the locomotive has to watch. In the 
daytime the movable arms of the semaphore in- 
dicate by their horizontal, oblique, or vertical 
position whether the tracks are clear. At night- 
time, on the other hand, the same information 
reaches him by the different colors of the signal 
lanterns. From a psychical point of view it is 
probable that the safety of the service would be 
increased if an unchangeable connection between 
signal and movement were formed. It would be 
sufficient for that purpose if the color signals at 
night were given up and were replaced by hori- 
zontal, oblique, or vertical lines of white light or 
176
-P-A-G-E-189
  THE ADJUSTMENT OF CONDITIONS: 
rows of points. Successful experiments of this 
kind have been carried on by psychologists in the 
service of this railroad problem.*? 
The interest in all these problems of large con- 
cerns, in transportation and factory work and 
complex industries, ought not to make us over- 
look the fact that on principle the same problems 
can be found in the simplest industrial establish- 
ment. Even the housewife or the cook destroys 
economic values if daily she has to spend useless 
minutes or hours on account of arrangements in 
the household which are badly adjusted to the 
psychological conditions. She sacrifices her energy 
in vain and she wastes her means where she her- 
self is under the illusion of especial economy. 
Scientific management would perhaps be no- 
where so wholesome as in kitchen and pantry, in 
laundry and cellar, just because here the saving 
would be multiplied millionfold and the final sum 
of energy saved and of feeling values gained would 
be enormous, even if it could not be calculated 
with the exactitude with which the savings of a 
factory budget can be proven. The profusion 
of small attractive devices which automatically 
perform the economic household labor and dis- 
burden the human workers must not hide the 
fact that the chief activities are still little adjusted 
to the psychophysical conditions. The situation 
177
-P-A-G-E-190
ee 
THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
is similar to that of the masons, whose function 
has also been performed for thousands of years, 
and yet which did not find a real adaptation to 
the psychical factors until a systematic time- 
measuring study was introduced. A manufacturer 
who sells an improved pan or mixing-spoon or 
broom expects success if he brings to the market 
something the merits of which are evident and 
make the housewife anticipate a decrease of work 
or a simplification of work, but the development 
of scientific management has shown clearly that 
the most important improvements are just those 
which are deduced from scientific researches, 
without at first giving satisfaction to the laborers 
themselves, until a new habit has been formed. 
Perhaps the most frequent technical activity 
of this simple kind is sewing by hand, which is 
still entirely left to the traditions of common 
sense, and yet which is evidently dependent upon 
the interplay of many psychical factors which de- 
mand a subtle adaptation to the psychical con- 
ditions. To approach, at least, this field of human 
labor a careful investigation of the psychophysics 
of sewing has been started in my laboratory.** 
The sewing work is done, with the left hand sup- 
ported, and the right hand connected with a sys- 
tem of levers which make a graphic record of 
every movement on the smoked surface of a re-

volving drum. For instance, we begin with simple 
over and over stitches, measuring the time and 
the character of the right hand movements for 50 
. stitches under a variety of technical conditions. 
The first variation refers to the length of the 
thread. The thread itself, fixed at the needle’s 
eye, varied between 3 feet and 6 inches in length. 
Other changes refer to the voluntary speed, to 
the number of stitches, to fatigue, to external 
stimuli, to attention, to methods of training, and 
so on, but the chief interest remains centred on 
the psychical factors. We are still too much at 
the beginning already to foresee whether it will 
be possible to draw from these psychophysical 
experiments helpful conclusions. The four young 
women engaged in this laboratory research will 
later extend it to the psychological conditions of 
work with the various types of sewing-machines.

THE ECONOMY OF MOVEMENT 
HE study of the technical aspect of labor 
can nowhere be separated by a sharp de- 
marcation line from the study of the labor itself 
as a function of the individual organism. Many 
problems, indeed, extend in both directions. The 
student of industrial efficiency is, for instance, 
constantly led to the question of fatigue. He may 
consider this fatigue as a function of brain and 
muscle activity and discuss it with reference to 
the psychophysical effort, but he is equally inter- 
ested in the question of how far the apparatus 
or the machine or the accessory conditions of the 
work might be changed in order to avoid fatigue. 
The accidents of the electric street railways were 
regarded as partly related to fatigue. The prob- 
lem was accordingly how to shorten the working 
time of the motormen in the interest of the pub- 
lic, but it was soon recognized that the difficulty 
might also be approached from the mere technical 
side. Some companies introduced seats which the 
motormen can use whenever they feel fatigue 
coming and excellent results have followed this 
innovation. In our last discussions the technical 
180
-P-A-G-E-193
THE ECONOMY OF MOVEMENT 
apparatus stood in the foreground. We may now 
consider as our real topic the psychophysical ac- 
tivity. 
Here, too, the leaders of scientific management 
have secured some signal successes. Their chief 
effort in this field was directed toward the greatest 
possible achievement by eliminating all superflu- 
ous movements and by training in those move- 
ment combinations which were recognized as the 
most serviceable ones. We may return to the case 
of the masons in order to clear up the principle. 
When Gilbreth began to reform the labor of the 
mason after scientific principles, he gave his chief 
interest to the men’s motions. Every muscle 
contraction which was needed to move the brick 
from the pile in the yard to the final position in 
the wall was measured with reference to space- 
and time-relations and the necessary effort. From 
here he turned to the application of well-known 
psychophysical principles. A movement is less 
fatiguing and therefore economically most profit- 
able if it occurs in a direction in which the greatest 
possible use of gravitation can be made. If both 
hands have to act at the same time, the labor can 
be carried out most quickly and with the small- 
est effort if corresponding muscle groups are at 
work and this means if symmetrical movements 
are performed. If unequal movements have to 
181  
-P-A-G-E-194
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
be made simultaneously, the effort will become 
smaller if they are psychically bound together by 
a common unified impulse. The distance which 
has to be overcome by hands, arms, or feet must 
be brought to a minimum for each partial move- 
ment. Most important, however, is this rule. If 
a definite combination of movements has been 
determined as economically most suitable, this 
method must be applied without any exception 
from the beginning of the learning. The point is 
to train from the start those impulse combina- 
tions which can slowly lead to the quickest and 
best work. The usual method is the opposite. 
Generally the beginner learns to produce from 
the beginning work which is as good and correct 
as possible. In order to produce such qualitat- 
ively good results at an early stage, it is left to 
him to choose any groups of movements which 
happen to be convenient to him. Then these be- 
come habitual, and as soon as he tries to go on 
to quicker work, these chance habits hinder him 
in his progress. The movements which may be 
best suited for fair production by a beginner may 
be entirely unsuited for really quick work, such 
as would be expected from an experienced man. 
The laborer must replace the first habits which he 
has learned by a new set, instead of starting in the 
first place with motions which can be continued 
182
-P-A-G-E-195
THE ECONOMY OF MOVEMENT 
until the highest point of efficiency has been 
reached, even if this involves rather a poor show- 
ing at the beginning. A final maximum rapidity 
must be secured from the start by the choice of those motions which have been standardized by 
careful experiments. 
It is also psychophysically important to de- 
mand that the movements shall not be suddenly 
stopped, if that can be avoided. Any interruption 
of a movement presupposes a special effort of the 
will which absorbs energy, and after the interrup- 
tion a new start must be made of which the same 
is true. On the other hand, if chains of movements 
become habitual, the psychophysical effort will 
be reduced to the minimum, inasmuch as each 
movement finds its natural end and is not artifi- 
cially interrupted by will, and at the same time 
each movement itself becomes a stimulus for the 
next movement by its accompanying sensations. 
The traditional method, for instance, demands 
that a brick be lifted with one hand and a trowel 
with mortar by the other hand. After that the 
lifting movement is interrupted, the brick comes 
to rest in the hand of the mason until the mortar 
has been spread on and the place prepared for 
the new brick. Then only begins a new action 
with the brick. This method was fundamentally 
changed. The laborers learned to swing the brick 
183 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
with one hand from the pack to the wall and at 
the same time to distribute the mortar over the 
next brick with the other hand. This whole com- 
plex movement is of course more difficult and de- 
mands a somewhat longer period of learning, but 
as soon as it is learned an extreme saving of psy- 
chophysical energy and a correspondingly great 
economic gain is secured. The newly trained ma- 
sons are not even allowed to gather up with the 
trowel any mortar which falls to the floor, be- 
cause it was found that the loss of mortar is eco- 
nomically less important than the waste of psy- 
chophysical energy in bending down. 
Whoever has once schooled his eye to observe 
the limitless waste of human motions and psycho- 
physical efforts in social life has really no difficulty 
in perceiving all this at every step. This ability 
to recognize possible savings of impulse may be 
brought to a certain virtuosity. Gantt, one of 
the leaders of the new movement, seems to be 
such a virtuoso. When he was in London, there 
was pointed out to him in the Japanese British 
Exhibition a young girl who worked so quickly 
that there at least he would find a rhythm of 
finger movement which could not any further be

while and found that she was able to manage 24 
boxes in 40 seconds. Then he told the young girl 
that she was doing it wrongly, and that she ought 
to try a new way which he showed her. At the 
first attempt, she disposed of 24 boxes in 26 sec- 
onds and at the second trial in 20 seconds. She 
did not have to make more effort for it, but simply 
had fewer movements to make. If such economic 
gain can be secured with little exertion in the 
simplest processes, it cannot be surprising that 
in the case of more complex and more advanced 
technical work which involves highly skilled la- 
bor, a careful psychophysical study of motions 
must bring far-reaching economic improvements. 
Yet the more important steps will have to be 
guided by special experimental investigations, and 
here the psychological laboratory must undertake 
the elaboration of the details. Only the system- 
atic experiment can determine what impulses can 
be released at the least expense of energy and 
with the greatest exactitude of the motor effect. 
Investigations on the psychophysics of move- 
ment and the influences which lead toward making 
the movement too large or too small have played 
an important réle in the psychological laboratories 
for several decades. It was recognized early that 
the mistakes which are made in reproducing a 
movement may spring from two different sources. 
185 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
They result partly from an erroneous perception 
or memory of the movement carried out, and 
partly from the inability to realize the movement 
intention. One series of investigations was ac- 
cordingly devoted to the studies of those sensa- 
tions and perceptions by which we become aware 
of the actual movement. Everything which ac- 
centuates these sensations must lead to an over- 
estimation of the motion, and the outcome is that 
the movement is made too small. The concentra- 
tion of attention, therefore, has the effect of re- 
ducing the actual motion, and the same influence 
must result from any resistance which is not re- 
cognized as such and hence is not subtracted in 
the judgment of the perceiver. Another series of 
researches was concerned with the inner attitude 
which causes a certain external movement effect 
and which may lead to an unintended amount of 
movement as soon as the weight to be lifted is 
erroneously judged upon. Closely related studies, 
finally, deal with a mistake which enters when 
the movement is reproduced from memory after 
a certain time. The exactitude of a simple arm 
movement seems to increase in the first ten se- 
conds, then rapidly to decrease. The emotional 
attitude, too, is of importance for the reproduc- 
tion of amovement. I trained myself in making 
definite extensor and flexor movements of the

arm until I was able to reproduce them under nor- 
mal conditions with great exactitude. In experi- 
ments extending over many months, which were 
carried on through the changing emotional atti- 
tudes of daily life, the exact measurement showed 
that both groups of movements became too large 
in states of excitement and too small in states of 
fatigue. But in astate of satisfaction and joy the 
extensor movement became too large, the flexor 
movement too small, and vice versa, in unpleasant 
emotional states the flexor movement was too 
strong and the extensor movement too weak.** 
We have a very careful investigation into the 
relations between rapidity of movement and 
exactitude.** The subjects had to perform a 
hand movement simultaneously with the beat of 
a metronome, the beats of which varied between 
20 and 200 in the minute. In general the accuracy 
of the movement decreases as the rapidity in- 
creases, but the descent is not uniform. Motions 
in the rhythm of 40 to the minute were on the 
whole just as exact as those in the rhythm of 20, 
and, on the other hand movements in the rhythm 
of 200 almost as accurate as those of 140 to the 
minute. Thus we have a lower limit below which 
decrease of rapidity does not increase the accur- 
acy any further, and an upper limit beyond which 
a further increase of rapidity brings no addi- 
187  
-P-A-G-E-200
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
tional deterioration. The mistakes of the unskilled 
left hand increase still more rapidly than the num- 
ber of movements. If the eyes are closed, the 
rapid movements are usually too long and the slow 
ones too short. 
An investigation in the Harvard laboratory 
varied this problem in a direction which brings it 
still nearer to technical conditions of industry. 
Our central question was whether the greatest 
exactitude of rhythmical movement is secured at 
the same rapidity for different muscle groups.** 
We studied especially rhythmical movements of 
hand, foot, arm, and head, and studied them, 
moreover, under various conditions of resistance. 
The result from 340,000 measured movements 
was the demonstration that every muscle group 
has its own optimum of rapidity for the greatest 
possible accuracy and that the complexity of the 
movement and the resistance which it finds has 
most significant influence on the exactitude of the 
rhythmical achievement. If we abstract at first 
from the fluctuations around the average value 
of a particular group of movements and con- 
sider only this average itself in its relation to the 
starting movement which it is meant to imitate, 
we find characteristic tendencies toward enlarge- 
ment or reduction dependent upon the rapidity. 
The right foot, for instance, remained nearest 
188
-P-A-G-E-201
  THE ECONOMY OF MOVEMENT 
to the original movement at a rapidity of 80 
motions in the minute, while the head did the 
same at about 20. For a hand movement of 14 
centimeters, the most favorable rapidity was 120 
repetitions in the minute, while for a hand move- 
ment of 1 centimeter the average remained near- 
est to the standard at about 40 repetitions. The 
mean variation from the average is the smallest 
for the left foot at 20 to 30 movements, for the 
right at 160 to 180, for the head at 40, for the 
larger hand movement at 180, and so on. Investi- 
gations of this kind have so far not affected in- 
dustrial life in the least, but it seems hardly 
doubtful that a systematic study of the move- 
ments necessary for economic work will have to 
pass through such strictly experimental phases. 
The essential point, however, will be for the man- 
agers of the industrial concerns and the psycho- 
logical laboratory workers really to come nearer 
to each other from the start and undertake the 
work in common, not in the sense that the labora- 
tory is to emigrate to the factory, but in the bet- 
ter sense that definite questions which grow out 
of the industrial life be submitted to the scientific 
investigation of the psychologists.

EXPERIMENTS ON THE PROBLEM OF MONOTONY i 
HE systematic organization of movements 
with most careful regard to the psycho- 
physical conditions appeared to us the most mo- 
mentous aid toward the heightening of efficiency. 
But even if the superfluous, unfit, and interfering 
movement impulses were eliminated and the con- 
ditions of work completely adjusted to the de- 
mands of psychology, there would still remain 
a large number of possibilities through which pro- 
ductiveness might be greatly decreased, or at least 
kept far below the possible maximum of efficiency. 
For instance, even the best adapted labor might 
be repeated to the point of exhaustion, at which 
the workman and the work would be ruined. ; 
Fatigue and restoration accordingly demand es- 
pecial consideration. In a similar way emotions 
may be conditions of stimulation or interference, 
and no one ought to underestimate the import- 
ance of higher motives, intellectual, esthetic, and 
moral motives, in their bearing on the psycho- 
physical impulses of the laborer. If these higher 
demands are satisfied, the whole system gains a 
new tonus, and if they are disappointed, the irri-

tation of the mental machinery may do more 
harm than any break in the physical machine at 
which the man is working. In short, we must still 
look in various directions to become aware of all 
the relations between the psychological factors 
and the economic output. We may begin with 
one question which plays a large, perhaps too 
large, réle in the economic and especially in the 
popular economic literature. I refer to the pro- 
blem of monotony of labor. 
In the discourses of our time on the lights and 
shades of our modern industrial life, all seem to 
agree that the monotony of industrial labor ought 
to be entered on the debit side of the ledger of 
civilization. Since the days when factories began 
to spring up, the accusation that through the 
process of division of labor the industrial working- 
man no longer has any chance to see a whole 
product, but that he has to devote himself to the 
minutest part of a part, has remained one of the 
matter-of-course arguments. The part of a part 
which he has to cut or polish or shape in endless 
repetition without alteration cannot awake any 
real interest. This complete division of labor has 
to-day certainly gone far beyond anything which 
Adam Smith described, and therefore it now ap- 
pears undeniable that the method must create 
a mental starvation which presses down the whole 
191
-P-A-G-E-204
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
life of the laborer, deprives it of all joy in work, 
and makes the factory scheme a necessary but 
from the standpoint of psychology decidedly re- 
grettable evil. I have become more and more 
convinced that the scientific psychologist is not 
obliged to endorse this judgment of popular 
psychology. 
To be sure the problem of division of labor, as 
it appears in the subdivision of manufacture, is 
intimately connected with many other related 
questions. It quickly leads to the much larger 
question of division of labor in our general social 
structure, which is necessary for our social life 
with its vocational and professional demands, 
and which undoubtedly narrows to a certain de- 
gree every individual in the completeness of his 
human desires. No man in modern society can 
devote himself to everything for which his mind 
may long. But as a matter of course these large 
general problems of civilization lie outside of the 
realm of our present inquiry. In another direc- 
tion the problem of monotony comes very near 
to the question of fatigue. But we must see 
clearly that these two questions are not identical 
and that we may discuss monotony here without 
arguing the problem of fatigue. The frequent 
repetition of the same movement or of the same 
mental activity certainly may condition an object- 
192
-P-A-G-E-205
  
THE PROBLEM OF MONOTONY 
ive fatigue, which may interfere with the eco- 
nomic output, but this is not the real meaning 
of the problem of monotony. About fatigue we 
shall speak later. Here we are concerned exclus- 
ively with that particular psychological attitude 
which we know as subjective dislike of uniformity 
and lack of change in the work. Within these 
limits the question of monotony is, indeed, fre- 
quently misunderstood in its economic signifi- 
cance. 
Let us not forget that the outsider can hardly 
ever judge when work offers or does not offer inner 
manifoldness. If we do not know and really un- 
derstand the subject, we are entirely unable to 
discriminate the subtler inner differences. The 
shepherd knows every sheep,"though the passer- 
by has the impression that they all look alike. 
This inability to recognize the differences which 
the man at work feels distinctly shows itself even 
in the most complicated activities. The natural- 
ist is inclined to fancy that the study of a phi- 
lologist must be endlessly monotonous, and the 
philologist is convinced that it must be utterly 
tiresome to devote one’s self a life long to some 
minute questions of natural science. Only when 
one stands in the midst of the work is he aware of 
its unlimited manifoldness, and feels how every 
single case is somehow different from every other. 
193 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  
THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
In the situation of the industrial workman, the 
attention may be directed toward some small dif- 
ferences which can only be recognized after long 
familiarity with the particular field. Certainly 
this field is small, as every workman must spe- 
cialize, but whether he manufactures a whole 
machine, or only a little wheel, makes no essential 
difference in the attitude. The attraction of new- 
ness is quickly lost also in the case of the most 
complicated machine. On the other hand, the fact 
that such a machine has an independent function 
does not give an independent attraction to the 
work. Or we might rather say, as far as the work 
on a whole machine is of independent value, the 
work of perfecting the little wheel is an independ- 
ent task also and offers equal value by its own 
possibilities. Whoever has recognized the finest 
Sete her iin the single little wheels and has 
become aware of how they are produced some- 
times better, sometimes worse, sometimes more 
e quickly, sometimes more slowly, becomes as much 
interested in the perfecting of the minute part as 
another man in the manufacture of the complex 
machine. It is true that the laborer does not feel 
interest in the little wheel itself, but in the pro- 
duction of the wheel. Every new movement 
necessary for it has a perfectly new chance and 
stands in new relations, which have nothing to do 
194
-P-A-G-E-207
  THE PROBLEM OF MONOTONY 
with the repetition. As a matter of course this 
interest in the always new best possible method 
of production is still strongly increased where 
piece-wages are introduced. The laborer knows 
that the amount of his earning depends upon the 
rapidity with which he finishes faultless pro- 
ducts. Under this stimulus he is in a continuous 
race with himself, and thus has every reason to 
prefer the externally uniform and therefore per- 
fectly familiar work to another kind which may 
bring alternation, but which also brings ever new 
demands. 
For a long while I have tried to discover in 
every large factory which I have visited the par- 
ticular job which from the standpoint of the out- 
sider presents itself as the most tiresome possible. 
As soon as I found it, I had a full frank talk with 
the man or woman who performed it and earnestly 
tried to get self-observational comment. My 
chief aim was to bring out how far the mere repe- 
tition, especially when it is continued through 
years, is felt as a source of discomfort. I may 
again point to a few chance illustrations. In an 
electrical factory with many thousands of em- 
ployees I gained the impression that the prize for 
monotonous work belonged to a woman who packs 
incandescent lamps in tissue paper. She wraps 
them from morning until night, from the first 
195
-P-A-G-E-208
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
day of the year to the last, and has been doing 
that for the last 12 years. She performs this pack- 
ing process at an average rate of 13,000 lamps a 
day. The woman has reached about 50,000,000 
times for the next lamp with one hand and with 
the other to the little pile of tissue sheets and 
then performed the packing. Each lamp demands 
about 20 finger movements. As long as I watched 
her, she was able to pack 25 lamps in 42 seconds, 
and only a few times did she need as many as 44 
seconds. Every 25 lamps filled a box, and the 
closing of the box required a short time for itself. 
She evidently took pleasure in expressing herself 
fully about her occupation. She assured me that 
she found the work really interesting, and that 
she constantly felt an inner tension, thinking how 
many boxes she would be able to fill before the 
next pause. Above all, she told me that there is 
continuous variation. Sometimes she grasps the 
lamp or paper in a different way, sometimes the 
packing itself does not run smoothly, sometimes 
she feels fresher, sometimes less in the mood for 
the work, and there is always something to ob- 
serve and something to think about." 
This was the trend which I usually found. In 
some large machine works I sought for a long 
time before I found the type of labor which 
seemed to me the most monotonous. I finally 
196
-P-A-G-E-209
THE PROBLEM OF MONOTONY 
settled on a man who was feeding an automatic 
machine which was cutting holes in metal strips 
and who simply had to push the strips slowly for- 
ward; only when the strip did not reach exactly 
the right place, he could stop the automatic ma- 
chine by a lever. He made about 34,000 uniform 
movements daily and had been doing that for 
the past 14 years. But he gave me the same ac- 
count, that the work was interesting and stimu- 
lating, while he himself made the impression of 
an intelligent workingman. At the beginning, he 
reported, the work had sometimes been quite 
fatiguing, but later he began to like it more and 
more. IJ imagined that this meant that at first he 
had to do the work with full attention and that 
the complex movement had slowly become auto- 
matic, allowing him to perform it like a reflex 
movement and to turn his thoughts to other 
things. But he explained to me in full detail that 
this was not the case, that he still feels obliged to 
devote his thoughts entirely to the work at hand, 
and that he is able only under these conditions to 
bring in the daily wage which he needs for his 
family, as he is paid for every thousand holes. 
But he added especially that it is not only the 
wage which satisfies him, but that he takes de- 
cided pleasure in the activity itself. 
On the other hand, I not seldom found wage-

  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
earners, both men and women, who seemed to 
have really interesting and varied activities and 
who nevertheless complained bitterly over the 
monotonous, tiresome factory labor. I became 
more and more convinced that the feeling of 
monotony depends much less upon the particular 
kind of work than upon the special disposition of 
the individual. It cannot be denied that the 
same contrast exists in the higher classes of work. 
We find school-teachers who constantly complain 
that it is intolerably monotonous to go on teach- 
ing immature children the rudiments of know- 
ledge, while other teachers with exactly the same 
task before them are daily inspired anew by the 
manifoldness of life in the classroom. We find 
physicians who complain that one case in their 
practice is like another, and judges who despair 
because they always have to deal with the same 
petty cases, while other judges and physicians 
feel clearly that every case offers something new 
and that the repetition as such is neither con- 
spicuous nor disagreeable. We find actors who feel 
it a torture to play the same réle every evening 
for several weeks, and there are actors who, as 
one of the most famous actresses assured me after 
the four hundredth performance of her star réle, 
repeat their parts many hundred times with 
undiminished interest, because they feel that 
198

  THE PROBLEM OF MONOTONY 
they are always speaking to new audiences. It seems not impossible that this individual differ- ence might be connected with deeper-lying psy- chophysical conditions. I approached the ques- tion, to be sure, with a preconceived theory. I fancied that certain persons had a finer, subtler 
sense for differences than others and that they would recognize a manifoldness of variations 
where the others would see only uniformity. In that I silently presupposed that the perception 
of the uniformity must be something disturbing and disagreeable and the recognition of variations 
something which stimulates the mind pleasantly. 
But when I came to examine the question experi- 
mentally, I hecame convinced that such a hypo- thesis is erroneous, and if I interpret the results 
correctly, I should say that practically the oppo- site relation exists. Those who recognize the uni- formities readily are not the ones who are dis- turbed by them. 
I proceeded in the following way. To make use of a large number of subjects accustomed to intelligent self-observation, I made the first series of experiments with the regular students in my psychology lecture course in Harvard University. 
Last winter I had more than four hundred men students in psychology who all took part in that introductory series. The task which I put before 
199
-P-A-G-E-212
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
them in a number of variations was this: I used 
lists of words of which half, or one more or less 
than half, belonged to one single conceptional 
group. There were names of flowers, or cities, 
or poets, or parts of the body, or wild animals, 
and so on. The remaining words of the list, on 
the other hand, were without inner connection and 
without similarity. The similar and the dissimilar 
words were mixed. The subjects listened to such 
a list of words and then had to decide without 
counting from the mere impression whether the 
similar words were more or equally or less numer- 
ous than the dissimilar words. In other experi- 
ments the arrangement was that two different 
lists were read and that in the two lists a larger 
or smaller number of words were repeated from 
the first list. Here, too, the subjects had to decide 
from the mere impression whether the repeated 
words were in the majority or not. In every exper- 
iment the judgment referred to those words which 
belonged to the same group and which were in this 
sense uniform, or to the repeated words, and it 
had to be stated with reference to them whether 
their number was larger, equal to, or smaller than 
the different words. If all replies had been correct, 
the judgment would have been 40 per cent equal, 
30 per cent smaller, and 30 per cent larger, as 
they were arranged in perfect symmetry. As soon 
200
-P-A-G-E-213
  THE PROBLEM OF MONOTONY 
as I had the results from the students, we figured 
out for every one what number he judged equal, 
smaller, or greater. Then we divided the equal 
judgments by 2 and added half of them to the 
larger and half to the smaller judgments. In this 
way we were enabled by one figure to character- 
ize the whole tendency of the individual. We 
found that in the whole student body there was 
a tendency to underestimate the number of the 
similar or of the repeated words. The majority 
of my students had a stronger impression from 
the varying objects than from those which were 
in a certain sense equal. Yet this tendency ap- 
peared in very different degrees and for about 
a fourth of the participants the opposite tend- 
ency prevailed. They received a stronger im- 
pression from the uniform ideas. 
I had coupled with these experimental tests a 
series of questions, and had asked every subject 
to express with fullest possible self-analysis his 
practical attitude to monotony in life. Every 
one had to give an account whether in the small 
habits of life he liked variety or uniform repeti- 
tion. He was asked especially as to his prefer- 
ences for or against uniformity in the daily meals, 
daily walks, and so on. Furthermore he had to 
report how far he is inclined to stick to one kind 
of work or to alternate his work, how far he wel- 
201 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
comes the idea that vocational work may bring 
repetition, and so on. And finally I tried to bring 
the results of these self-observations into relation 
with the results of those experiments. It was 
here that the opposite of the hypothesis which I 
had presupposed suggested itself to me with sur- 
prising force. I found that just the ones who 
perceive the repetition least hate it most, and 
that those who have a strong perception of the 
uniform impressions and who overestimate their 
number are the ones who on the whole welcome 
repetition in life. 
As soon as I had reached this first experimental 
result, I began to see how it might harmonize 
with known psychological facts. Some years ago 
a Hungarian psychologist *” showed by interest- 
ing experiments that if a series of figures is ex- 
posed to the eye for a short fraction of a second, 
equal digits are seen only once, and he came to the 
conclusion that equal impressions in such a series 
inhibit each other. In the Harvard laboratory 
we varied these experiments by eliminating the 
spatial separation of those numbers. In our 
experiments the digits did not stand side by 
side, but followed one another very quickly in 
the same place.** Similar experiments we made 
with colors and so on. Here, too, we found that 
quickly succeeding equal or very similar impres- 
202
-P-A-G-E-215
} 
THE PROBLEM OF MONOTONY 
sions have a tendency to inhibit each other or to 
fuse with each other. Where such an inhibition 
occurs, we probably ought to suppose that the 
perception of the first impression exhausts the 
psychical disposition for this particular mental 
experience. The psychophysical apparatus be- 
comes for a moment unable to arouse the same 
impression once more. 
The above described new experiments suggest 
to me that this inhibition of equal or similar im- 
pressions is found unequally developed in different 
individuals. They possess a different tendency 
to temporary exhaustion of psychophysical dis- 
positions. There are evidently persons who after 
they have received an impression are unable im- 
mediately to seize the same impression again. 
Their attention and their whole inner attitude 
| fails. But there are evidently other persons for 
| whom, on the contrary, the experience of an im- 
| pression is a kind of inner preparation for arousing 
the same or a similar impression. In their case 
the psychophysical dispositions become stimu- 
lated and excited, and therefore favor the repeti- 
tion. If, as in our experiments, the task is simply 
to judge the existence of equal or similar impres- 
sions without any strain of attention, the one 
group of persons must underestimate the number 
of the equal impressions because many words are 
203  
-P-A-G-E-216
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
simply inhibited in their minds and remain neg- 
lected, the other groups of persons must from 
their mental dispositions overestimate the num- 
ber of similar words. From here we have to take 
one step more. If these two groups of persons have 
to perform a task in which it isnecessary that not 
a single member of a series of repetitions be over- 
looked, it is clear that the two groups must react 
in a very different way. Now a perfect percep- 
tion of every single member is forced on them. 
Those who grasp equal impressions easily, and 
who are prepared beforehand for every new re- 
petition by their inner dispositions, will follow 
the series without strain and will experience the 
repetition itself with true satisfaction. On the 
other hand, those in whom every impression in- 
hibits the readiness to receive a repetition, and 
whose inner energy for the same experience is ex- 
hausted, must feel it as a painful and fatiguing 
effort if they are obliged to turn their attention 
to one member after another in a uniform series. 
This mental torture is evidently the displeasure 
which such individuals call the dislike of mono- 
tony in their work. Whether this theoretical view 
is correct, we have to determine by future studies. 
In our Harvard laboratory we have now pro- 
ceeded from such preparatory mass experiments 
to subtle investigations on a small, number of 
204
-P-A-G-E-217
  THE PROBLEM OF MONOTONY 
persons well trained in psychological self-obser- 
vation with whom the conditions of the experi- 
ment can be varied in many directions.*® 
It would seem probable that such experiments 
might also win psychotechnical significance. A 
short series of tests which would have to be 
adapted to the special situations, and which for 
the simple wage-earner would have to be much 
easier than those sketched above, would allow it 
to be determined beforehand whether an indi- 
vidual will suffer from repetition in work. Even 
if we abstract from arguments of social reform and 
consider exclusively the economic significance, it 
must seem important that labor which involves 
much repetition be performed by men and women 
whose mental dispositions favor an easy grasp of 
successive uniform impressions. Experimentation 
could secure the selection of the fit workmen and 
the complaint of monotony would disappear. The 
same selection could be useful in the opposite 
direction, as many economic occupations, espe- 
cially in our time of automatic machines, de- 
mand a quick and often rhythmical transition 
from one activity to another. It is evident that 
those whose natural dispositions make every men- 
tal excitement a preparation not for the identical 
but for the contrasting stimulation will be nat- 
urally equipped for this kind of economic tasks.

ATTENTION AND FATIGUE 
HE problem of monotony may lead us on 
to other conditions through which atten- 
tion is hindered and the product of labor thereby 
decreased. The psychologist naturally first thinks 
of external distractions of attention. If he turns 
to practical studies of the actual economic life, 
he is often decidedly surprised to find how little 
regard is given to this psychophysical factor. In 
industrial establishments in which the smallest 
disturbance in the machine is at once remedied 
by a mechanic in order that the greatest possible 
economic effect may be secured, frequently no- 
body takes any interest in the most destructive 
disturbances which unnecessarily occur in the 
subtlest part of the factory mechanism, namely, 
the attention apparatus of the laborers. Such an 
interference with attention must, for instance, 
be recognized when the workingman, instead of 
devoting himself to one complex function, has to 
carry out secondary movements which appear 
to be quite easily performed and not to hinder 
him in his chief task. Often his own feeling may 
endorse this impression. Of course the individual 
206
-P-A-G-E-219

differences in this direction are very great. The 
faculty of carrying on at the same time various 
independent functions is unequally distributed 
and the experiment can show this clearly. It is 
also well known from practical life that some men 
can easily go on dictating to a stenographer while 
they are affixing their signature to several hun- 
dred circular letters, or can continue their fluent 
lecture while they are performing experimental 
demonstrations. With others such a side activity 
continually interrupts the chief function. Then 
some succeed better than others in securing a 
certain automatism of the accessory function to 
such a point that its special acts do not come to 
consciousness at all. For example, I watched a 
laborer who was constantly engaged in a com- 
plicated technical performance, and he seemed 
to give to it his full attention. Nevertheless he 
succeeded in moving a lever on an automatic 
machine which stood near by whenever a certain 
wheel had made fifty revolutions. During all his 
work he kept counting the revolutions without 
being conscious of any idea of number. A system 
of motor reactions had become organized which 
remained below the threshold of consciousness 
and which produced only at the fiftieth recur- 
rence the conscious psychical impulse to perform 
the lever movement. Yet whether the talent 
207
-P-A-G-E-220
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
for such simultaneous mastery of independent 
functions be greater or smaller and the demand 
more or less complex, in every case the principal 
action must be hampered by the side issue. To 
be sure, it may sometimes be economically more 
profitable to allow the hindrance to the chief 
work in order to save the expense of an extra man 
to do the side work. In most cases, however, such 
a consideration is not involved; it is simply an 
ignoring of the psychological situation. As the 
accessory work seems easy, its hindering influence 
on other functions is practically overlooked. 
Psychological laboratory experiments have shown 
in many different directions that simultaneous 
independent activities always disturb and in- 
hibit one another. 
We must not forget that even the conversations 
of the laborers belong in this psychophysical 
class. Where a continuous strain of attention has 
produced a state of fatigue, a short conversation 
will bring a certain relief and relaxation, and the 
words which the speaker hears in reply will pro- 
duce a general stimulation of psychical energy for 
the moment. Moreover, the mere existence of the 
social conversational intercourse will raise the 
general emotional mood, and this feeling of social 
pleasure may be the source from which may spring 
new psychophysical powers. Nevertheless the 
208

ATTENTION AND FATIGUE 
fundamental fact, after all, is that any talking 
during the labor, so far as it is not necessary for 
the work itself, surely involves a distraction of 
attention. Here, too, the individual is not con- 
scious of the effect. He feels certain that he can 
perform his task just as well, and even the piece- 
worker, who is anxious to earn as much as possible, 
is convinced that he does not retard himself by 
conversation. But the experiments which have 
been carried on in establishments with scientific 
management speak decidedly against such a sup- 
position. A tyrannical demand for silence would, 
of course, be felt as cruelty, and no suggestion 
of a jail-like discipline would be wise in the case 
of industrial labor, for evident psychological 
reasons. But various factories in rearranging 
their establishments according to the principles 
of scientific management have changed the posi- 
tions of the workmen so that conversations be- 
come more difficult or impossible. The result re- 
ported seems to be everywhere a significant 
increase of production. The individual concen- 
trates his mind on the task with an intensity 
which seems beyond his reach as long as the inner 
attitude is adjusted to social contact. The help 
which is rendered by the feeling of social codpera- 
tion, on the other hand, is not removed by the 
mere abstaining from speaking. Interesting psy-

THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
chopedagogical experiments have, indeed, demon- 
strated that working in a common room produces 
better results than isolated activity. This is 
not true of the most brilliant, somewhat nervous 
school children, who achieve in their own room 
at home more than in the classroom. But for the 
average, which almost alone is in question for 
life in the factory, the consciousness of common 
effort is a source of psychophysical reinforcement. 
This evidently remains effective when the work- 
ingmen can see one another, even if the arrange- 
ment of the seats precludes the possibility of 
chatting during the work. 
However, by far the more important cause of 
distraction of attention lies in those disturbances 
which come from without. Here again the chief 
interest ought to be attached to those interfer- 
ences which the workman himself no longer feels 
as such. In a great printing-shop a woman who 
was occupied with work which demanded her 
fullest attention was seated at her task in an 
aisle where trucking was done. Removing this 
operator to a quiet corner caused an increase of 
25 per cent in her work.‘ To be sure there are 
many such disturbances in factory life which can 
hardly be eliminated with the technical means 
of to-day. For instance, the noise of the machines, 
which in many factories makes it impossible to 
210 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
  ATTENTION AND FATIGUE 
communicate except by shouting, must be classed 
among the real psychological interferences in 
spite of the fact that the laborers themselves 
usually feel convinced that they no longer notice 
it at all. Still more disturbing are strong rhyth- 
mical sounds, such as heavy hammer blows 
which dominate the continuous noises, as they 
force on every individual consciousness a psycho- 
physical rhythm of reaction which may stand 
in strong contrast to that of a man’s own work. 
From the incessant inner struggle of the two 
rhythms, the one suggested by the labor, the 
other by the external intrusion, quick exhaustion 
becomes unavoidable. 
If it were our purpose to elaborate a real sys- 
tem of psychological economics, we should have 
to proceed here to a careful study of the influ- 
ences of fatigue on the industrial achievement. 
We should have to discuss the various kinds of 
fatigue and exhaustion, the conditions of restora- 
tion, and the whole group of related problems of 
psychophysics. But this is the one field which 
has been thoroughly ploughed over by science 
and by practical life in the course of the last dec- . 
ades. No new suggestion and no new hint of the 
importance of the problem is needed here. Our 
short discussion was planned to be confined to 
those regions which have not been worked up in 
211
-P-A-G-E-224
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
systematic investigations and for which new de- 
vices seemed desirable. Hence we do not repro- 
duce here the rich material of facts which the 
physiologists and psychophysicists have brought 
together in the last half-century, the importance 
of which for industrial labor is perfectly evident. 
Moreover, the practical applications and the in- 
sight into the social needs have transformed the 
factories themselves into one big laboratory in 
which the problem of fatigue has been studied 
by practical experiments. The problem of the 
dependence of fatigue and output upon the length 
of the working day has been tested in numberless 
places with the methods of really exact research, 
as it was easy to find out how the achievement 
of the laborers became quantitatively and qual- 
itatively changed by the shortening of the work- 
ing hours. 
When in one civilized country after another 
the exhaustingly long working days of the indus- 
trial wage-earner were shortened more and more, 
the theoretical discussions of the legislators and 
of the social reformers were soon supplemented 
by careful statistical inquiries in the factories. 
It was found that everywhere, even abstracting 
from all other cultural and social interests, a mod- 
erate shortening of the working day did not in- 
volve loss, but brought a direct gain. The Ger- 
212
-P-A-G-E-225
ATTENTION AND FATIGUE 
man pioneer in the movement for the shortening 
of the workingman’s day, Ernst Abbé, the head 
of one of the greatest German factories, wrote 
many years ago that the shortening from nine 
to eight hours, that is, a cutting-down of more 
than 10 per cent, did not involve a reduction of 
the day’s product, but.an increase, and that this 
increase did not result from any supplementary 
efforts by which the intensity of the work would 
be reinforced in an unhygienic way.*! This con- 
viction of Abbé still seems to hold true after mil- 
lions of experiments over the whole globe. But 
the problem of fatigue has forced itself on the con- 
sideration of the men of affairs from still another 
side. It has been well known for a long while how 
intimate the relations are between fatigue and in- 
dustrial accidents. The statistics of the various 
countries and of the various industries do not har- 
monize exactly, but a close connection between 
the number of accidents and the hours of the day 
can be recognized everywhere. Usually the great- 
est number of injuries occurs between ten and 
eleven o’clock in the forenoon and between three 
and four o’clock in the afternoon. The different 
distribution of the working hours, and of the 
pauses for the meals, make the various statistical 
tables somewhat incomparable. But it can be 
traced everywhere that in the first working hours 
213
-P-A-G-E-226
THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
in which fatigue does not play any considerable 
role, the number of accidents is small, and that 
this number sinks again after the long pauses. 
It is true that the number also becomes somewhat 
smaller at the end of the forenoon and of the after- 
noon period, but this seems to have its cause in 
the fact that with growing fatigue and with the 
feeling that the end of the working period is near, 
the rhythm of the activity becomes much slower, 
and with such slower movements the danger of 
accidents is greatly reduced. In a similar way the 
factories have had to give the fullest attention to 
the fatigue problem in its relation to the distribu- 
tion of pauses, and above all in its relation to the 
advisable speed of the machines, the limits of 
which are set by the fatigue of the workingmen, 
and still more of the working-women. 
The legislatures, the labor unions, and the 
manufacturers have then had this problem of fa- 
tigue constantly before their eyes.*? On the other 
hand, the psychologists and physiologists have 
continuously studied the fatigue and restoration 
of the muscle system and of the central nervous 
system, and have analyzed the facts with the 
subtlest methods. Yet, in spite of this, it cannot 
be denied that a real mutual enrichment has so 
far hardly been in question. On the contrary, the 
whole situation has again demonstrated the old 
214
-P-A-G-E-227
  ATTENTION AND FATIGUE 
experience. The mere trying and trying again in 
practical life can never reach the maximum effects 
which may be secured by systematic, scientifically 
conducted efforts. On the other side the studies 
of the theoretical scholars can never yield the 
highest values for civilization if the problems 
which offer themselves in practical life are ignored. 
The theorists have to prepare the ground, and 
in this preparatory work they must, indeed, re- 
main utterly regardless of any practical situations. 
But after that a second stage must be reached 
at which on the foundation of this neutral re- 
search special theoretical investigations are un- 
dertaken which originate from practical condi- 
tions. As long as industrial managers have no 
contact with the experiments of the laboratory 
and the experimentalists are shy of any contact 
with the industrial reality, humanity will pass 
through social suffering. The hope of mankind 
will be realized by the mutual fertilization of 
knowing and doing. 
The practical efforts of the factories have, in- 
deed, not yet reached the point at which the great- ° 
est possible achievement which can be reached 
without over-fatigue may be secured. We called 
the abbreviation of the working day an experi- 
mental scheme. The question of reducing the 
working hours is so simple that no further special 
215
-P-A-G-E-228
THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
experiments are needed. But when we come to 
the questions of the pauses at work, the speed of 
work and similar factors related to fatigue, the sit- 
uation is by far more complicated, and the often 
capricious changes in the plant have very little 
in common with a systematic experiment. Some 
well-known studies of the efficiency engineers 
clearly demonstrate the possibility of such sys- 
tematic efforts. The best-known case is probably 
Taylor’s study of the pig-iron handlers of the 
Bethlehem Steel Company. He found that the 
gang of 75 men was loading on the average about 
12} tons per man per day. When he discussed 
with various managers the question of what out- 
put would be the possible maximum, they agreed 
that under premium work, piecework, or any of 
the ordinary plans for stimulating the men, an 
output of 18 to 25 tons would be the extreme pos- 
sibility. Then he proceeded to a systematic study 
of the fatigue in its relation to the burden and of 
the best possible relation between working time 
and resting time. His first efforts to find formulas 
were unsuccessful, because he calculated only 
the actual mechanical energy exerted and found 
that some men were tired after exerting energy 
of  hp., while others seemed to be able to pro- 
duce the energy of 3 hp. without greater fatigue. 
But soon he discovered the mistake in his figures. 
216
-P-A-G-E-229
  ATTENTION AND FATIGUE 
He had considered only the actual movements, 
and had neglected the period in which the laborer 
was not moving and was not exerting energy, but 
in which a weight was pulling his arms and de- 
manding a corresponding muscular effort. As 
soon as this muscular achievement was taken into 
account, too, he found that for each particular 
weight a definite relation exists between the time 
that a man is under a heavy load and the time of 
rest. For the usual loads of 90 pounds, he found 
that a first-class laborer must not work more than 
43 per cent of the working day and must be entirely 
without load 57 per cent. If the load becomes 
lighter, the relation is changed. If the workman 
is handling a half pig weighing 46 pounds, he can 
be under load 58 per cent of the day and only has 
to rest during 42 per cent.** 
As soon as these figures were experimentally se- 
cured, Taylor selected fit men, and did not allow 
them to lift and to carry the loads as they pleased, 
but every movement was exactly prescribed by 
foremen who timed exactly the periods of work 
and rest. If he had simply promised his men a 
high premium in case they should carry more 
than the usual 12 tons a day, they would have 
burdened themselves as heavily as possible and 
would have carried the load as quickly as possible, 
thus completely exhausting themselves after three 
Q17 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
or four hours of labor. In spite of such senseless 
exaggeration of effort in the first hours, the total 
output for the day would have been relatively 
small. Now the foremen determined exactly when 
every individual should lift and move the load 
and when he should sit quietly. The result was 
that the men, without greater fatigue, were able 
to carry 47} tons a day instead of the 123 tons. 
Their wages were increased 60 per cent. Such a 
trivial illustration demonstrates very clearly the 
extreme difference between an increase of the eco- 
nomic achievement by scientific, experimental in- 
vestigation and a mere enforcing of more work by 
artificially whipping-up the mind with promises 
of extraordinary wages. Yet even such rules as the 
scientific management engineers have formed, 
may be elaborated to more lasting prescriptions 
as soon as the purely psychological factors are 
brought more into the foreground and are ap- 
proached with the careful analysis of the experi- 
mental psychologist. 
Such a systematic psychological inquiry is the 
more important for questions of fatigue, as we 
know that the subjective feeling of displeasure 
in fatigue is no reliable measure for the objective 
fatigue, that is, for the real reduction of the abil- 
ity for work. Daily experience teaches us how 
easily some people overstep the limits of normal 
218
-P-A-G-E-231
ATTENTION AND FATIGUE 
fatigue, and in extreme cases even come to a ner- 
vous breakdown because nature did not protect 
them by the timely appearance of strong fatigue 
feelings. On the other hand, we find many men 
and still more women who feel tired even after 
a small exertion, because they did not learn early 
to inhibit the superficial feelings of fatigue, or be- 
cause the sensations of fatigue have in fact a cer- 
tain abnormal intensity in their case. The ques- 
tion how far the psychophysical apparatus has 
really been exhausted by a certain effort must be 
answered with the help of objective research and 
not on the basis of mere subjective feelings. But 
such objective measurements demand systematic 
experiments in the laboratory. 
The experiments which really have been car- 
ried on in the laboratory as yet, as far as they 
' were not merely physiological, have on the whole 
been confined to so-called mental labor, and were 
essentially devoted to problems of school instruc- 
tion or medical diagnosis. We have no doubt ex- 
cellent experiments which are devoted to the 
study of the individual differences of exhaustion, 
fatigue, exhaustibility, ability to recover the lost 
energy, ability to learn from practice, and so on, 
but they are still exclusively adjusted to the needs 
of the school-teacher and of the nerve specialist 
and would hardly be immediately useful to the 
219

manager of a factory. We shall need a long care- 
ful series of investigations in order to determine 
how far those manifold results from experiments 
with memory work, thought work, writing work, 
and so on can be applied to the work which the 
industrial laborer is expected to perform.

PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCES ON THE 
WORKING POWER 
HE increase and decrease of the ability to 
do good work depends of course not only 
upon the direct fatigue from labor and the pauses 
for rest; a large variety of other factors may lead 
to fluctuations which are economically important. 
The various hours of the day, the seasons of the 
year, the atmospheric conditions of weather and 
climate, may have such influence. Some elements 
of this interplay have been cleared up in recent 
years. Just as the experiments of pedagogical 
psychology have determined the exact curve of 
efficiency during the period of an hour in school, 
so other investigations have traced the typical 
curve of psychical efficiency throughout the day 
and the year. Sociological and criminological 
statistics concerning the fluctuations in the be- 
havior of the masses, common-sense experience of 
practical life, and finally, economic statistics con- 
cerning the quantity and quality of industrial 
output in'various parts of the day and of the year, 
have supplemented one another. The systematic 
221 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
assistance of the psychological laboratory, how- 
ever, has been confined to the educational aspect 
of the problem. Psychological experiments have 
determined how the achievement of the youth in 
the schoolroom changes with the months of the 
year and the hours of the day. It seems as if it 
could not be difficult to secure here, too, a connec- 
tion between exact experiment and economic 
work. Much will have to be reduced to individual 
variations. The laboratory has already confirmed 
the experience of daily life that there are morn- 
ing workers whose strongest psychophysical effi- 
ciency comes immediately after the night’s rest, 
while the day’s work fatigues them more and 
more; and that there are evening workers who in 
the morning still remain under the after effects 
of the night’s sleep, and who slowly become 
fresher and fresher from the stimuli of the day. 
It would seem not impossible to undertake a sys- 
tematic selection of various individuals under 
this point of view, as different industrial tasks 
demand a different distribution of efficiency be- 
tween morning and night. 
Such a selection and adjustment may be eco- 
nomically still more important with reference to 
the fluctuations during the course of the year. 
Economic inquiries, for instance, have suggested 
that younger and older workingmen who ordin- 
222
-P-A-G-E-235
  
PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCES 
arily show the same efficiency become unequal 
in their ability to do good work in the spring 
months, and the economists have connected this 
inequality with sexual conditions. But other 
factors as well, especially the blood circulation of 
the organism and the resulting reactions to ex- 
ternal temperature, different gland activities, and 
so on, cause great personal differences in efficiency 
during the various seasons of the year. Inasmuch 
as we know many economic occupations in which 
the chief demand is made in one or another period 
of the year, a systematic study of these individual 
variations might be of high economic value, where 
large numbers are involved, and might contribute 
much to the individual comfort of the workers. 
But a constant relation to day and year also seems 
to exist independent of all personal variations. 
When the sun stands at its meridian, a minimum 
of efficiency is to be expected and a similar mini- 
mum is to be found at the height of summer. 
Correspondingly we have an increase of the total 
psychical efficiency in winter-time. During the 
spring-time the behavior seems, as far as the in- 
vestigations go, to be different in the intellectual 
and in the psychomotor activities. It is claimed 
that the efficiency of the intellectual functions de- 
creases as the winter recedes, but that the effi- 
ciency of psychomotor impulses increases.‘ 
223  
-P-A-G-E-236
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
The influences of the daily temperature, of the 
weather and of the seasons may be classed among 
the physical conditions of efficiency. We may 
group with them the effects of ‘nourishment, of 
stimulants, of sleep, and so on. As far as the re- 
lations between these external factors and purely 
bodily muscle work are involved, the interests 
of the psychologists are not engaged. But it is 
evident that every one of these relations also has 
its psychological aspect, and that a really scien- 
tific psychotechnical treatment of these problems 
can become possible only through the agency of 
psychological experiments. We have excellent ex- 
perimental investigations concerning the influ- 
ence of the loss of sleep on intellectual labor and 
on simple psychomotor activities. But it would 
be rather arbitrary to deduce from the results of 
those researches anything as to the effect of re- 
duction of sleep on special economic occupations. 
Yet such knowledge would be of highimportance. 
We have in the literature concerned with accidents 
in transportation numerous popular discussions 
about the destructive influence of loss of sleep on 
the attention of the locomotive engineer or of 
the helmsman or of the chauffeur, but an analysis 
of the particular psychophysical processes does 
not as yet exist and can be expected only from 
systematic experiments. Nor has the influence 
224
-P-A-G-E-237
  PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCES 
of hunger on psychotechnical activities been 
studied in a satisfactory way. 
A number of psychological investigations have 
been devoted to the study of the influence of 
alcohol on various psychical functions and in 
this field at least the strictly economic problem of 
industrial labor has sometimes been touched. We 
have the much quoted and much misinterpreted 
experiments ** which were carried on in Germany 
with typesetters. The workmen received def- 
inite quantities of heavy wine at a particular 
point in the work and the number of letters which 
they were ableto set during the following quarter- 
hours were measured and compared with their nor- 
malachievementin fifteen minutes. Thereduction 
of efficiency amounted on the average to 15 per 
cent of the output. It may be mentioned that 
the loss referred only to the quantity of the work 
and not at all to the quality. The well-known 
subjective illusory feeling of the subjects was not 
lacking; they themselves believed that the wine 
had reinforced their working power. As soon as 
such experiments are put into the service of 
economic life, they will have to be carried on 
with much more accurate adjustment to the 
special conditions, with subtler gradation of the 
stimuli, and especially with careful study of in- 
dividual factors. But at first it seems more in the 
225 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
interest of the practical task that the extremely 
complicated problem of the influence of alcohol 
be followed up by purely theoretical research in 
the laboratory in order that the effect may be re- 
solved into its various components. We must first 
find the exact facts concerning the influence of 
alcohol on elementary processes of mental life, 
such as perception, attention, memory, and so on, 
and this will slowly prepare the way for the com- 
plete economic experiment. 
At present the greatest significance for the eco- 
nomic field may be attached to those alcohol ex- 
periments which dealt with the apprehension of 
the outer world. They proved a reduction in the 
ability to grasp the impressions and a narrowing 
of the span of consciousness. The indubitable 
decrease of certain memory powers, of the acuity 
in measuring distance, of the time estimation, and 
similar psychical disturbances after alcohol, must 
evidently be of high importance for industry and 
transportation, while the well-known increase of 
the purely sensory sensibility, especially of the 
visual acuity after small doses of alcohol, hardly 
plays an important réle in practical life. The 
best-known and experimentally most studied 
effect of alcohol, the increase of motor excitability, 
also evidently has its importance for industrial 
achievements. It cannot be denied that this facil- 
226
-P-A-G-E-239
  
PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCES 
ity of the motor impulses after small doses of 
alcohol is not a real gain, which might be utilized 
economically, but is ultimately an injury to the 
apparatus, even if we abstract from the retarda- 
tion of the reaction which comes as an after-effect. 
The alcoholic facilitation, after all, reduces the 
certainty and the perfection of the reaction and 
creates conditions under which wrong, and this in 
economic life means often dangerous, motor re- 
sponses arise. The energy of the motor discharge 
suffers throughout from the alcohol. 
Some experiments which were recently carried 
‘on with reference to the influence of alcohol on 
the power of will seem to have especial signifi- 
cance for the field of economic activity. The me- 
thod applied in the experiment was the artificial 
creation of an exactly measurable resistance to 
the will-impulse directed toward a purpose. The 
experiment had to determine what power of re- 
sistance could be overcome by the will and how 
far this energy changes under the influence of 
alcohol. For this end combinations of meaning- 
less syllables were learned and repeated until they 
formed a close connection in memory. If one 
syllable was given, the mechanical tendency of 
the mind was to reproduce the next syllable in the 
memorized series. The will-intention was then 
directed toward breaking this memory type. For 
227 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
    THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
instance, it was demanded, when a syllable was 
called, that the subject should not answer with 
the next following syllable, but with a rhyming 
syllable. This will-impulse easily succeeded when 
the syllables to be learned had been repeated only 
a few times, while after a very frequent repeti- 
tion the memory connection offered a resistance 
which the simple will-intention could not break. 
The syllable which followed in the series rushed 
to the mind before the intention to seek a rhyming 
syllable could be realized. The number of repeti- 
tions thus became a measure for the power of the 
will. After carrying out these experiments at first 
under normal conditions, they were repeated while 
the subjects were under the influence of exactly 
graded doses of alcohol.‘* From such simple tasks 
the experiment was turned to more and more com- 
plex ones of similar structure. All together they 
showed clearly that the alcohol did not influence 
the ability to make the will effective and that the 
actual decrease of achievement results from a 
decrease in the ability to grasp the material. As 
long as the alcohol doses are small, this feeling of 
decreased ability stirs up a reinforcement in the 
tension of the will-impulse. This may go to such 
an extent that the increased will-effort not only 
compensates for the reduced understanding, but 
even over-compensates for it, producing an im- 
228
-P-A-G-E-241
PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCES 
provement in the mental work. But as soon as 
the alcohol doses amount to about 100 cubic 
centimeters, the increased tension of the will is 
no longer sufficient to balance the paralyzing effect 
in the understanding. Yet it must not be over- 
looked that in all these experiments only isolated 
will acts were in question which were separated 
from one another by pauses of rest. Evidently, 
however, the technical laborer is more often in a 
situation in which not isolated impulses, but a con- 
tinuous tension of the will is demanded. How far 
such an uninterrupted will-function is affected 
by alcohol has not as yet been studied with the 
exact means of the experiment. 
To be sure an obvious suggestion would be that 
the whole problem, as far as economics, and es- 
pecially industry, aré concerned, might be solved 
in a simpler way than by the performance of 
special psychological experiments, namely, by 
the complete elimination of alcohol itself from the 
life of the wage-earner. The laboratory experi- 
ment which seems to demonstrate a reduction of 
objective achievement in the case of every im- 
portant mental function merely supplements in 
exact language the appalling results indicated by 
criminal statistics, disease statistics, and inher- 
itance statistics. It seems as if the time had 
come when scientists could not with a good

conscience suggest any other remedy than the 
merciless suppression of alcohol. Indeed, there 
can be no doubt that alcohol is one of the worst 
enemies of civilized life, and it is therefore almost 
with regret that the scientist must acknowledge 
that all the psychological investigations, which 
have so often been misused in the partisan writ- 
ings of prohibitionists, are not a sufficient basis 
to justify the demand for complete abstinence. 
First, newer experiments make it very clear 
that many of the so-called effects of alcohol which 
the experiment has demonstrated are produced 
or at least heightened by influences of suggestion. 
Experiments which have been carried on in 
England for the study of that point show clearly 
that certain psychical disturbances which seem 
to result from small doses of alcohol fail to appear 
as soon as the subject does not know that he has 
taken alcohol. For that purpose it was necessary 
to eliminate the odor, and this was accomplished 
by introducing the beverages into the organism 
by a stomach pump. When by this method some- 
times water and sometimes diluted alcohol was 
given without the knowledge of the subject, the 
usual effects of small doses of alcohol did not arise. 
But another point is far more important. We may 
take it for granted that alcohol reduces the abil- 
ity for achievement as soon as such very small 
230
-P-A-G-E-243
  PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCES 
doses are exceeded. But from the standpoint of 
economic life we have no right to consider a re- 
duction of the psychical ability to produce work 
as identical with a decrease in the economic value 
of the personality. Such a view would be right 
if the influence necessarily set in at the beginning 
of the working period. But if, for instance, a 
moderate quantity of beer is introduced into the 
organism after the closing of the working day, 
it would certainly produce an artificial reduction 
of the psychical ability, and yet this decrease of 
psychophysical activity might be advantageous to 
the total economic achievement of the workingman 
in the course of the week or the year. To be sure 
the glass of beer in the evening paralyzes certain 
inhibitory centres of the brain and therefore puts 
the mind out of gear, but such a way of expressing 
it may easily be misleading, as it suggests too 
much that a real injury is done. From the point 
of view of scientific psychology, we must acknow- 
ledge that such a paralyzing effect in certain parts 
of the psychophysical system sets in with every 
act of attention and reaches its climax in sleep, 
which surely does no harm to the mind. It may 
be thoroughly advantageous for the total work 
of the normal, healthy, average workingman if 
the after effects of the motor excitement of the 
day are eliminated by a mild, short alcoholic poi- 
231  
-P-A-G-E-244

soning in the evening. It may produce that nar- 
rowing and dulling of consciousness which extin- 
guishes the cares and sorrows of the day and 
secures the night’s sleep, and through it increased 
efficiency the next morning. Systematic experi- 
ments with exact relation to the various technical 
demands must slowly bring real insight into this 
complex situation. The usual hasty generalization 
from a few experiments with alcohol for partisan 
interests is surely not justified in the present un- 
satisfactory state of knowledge.*” 
Perhaps we know still less of the influences 
which coffee, tea, tobacco, sweets, and so on exert 
on the life of the industrial worker. It will be wise 
to resolve these stimuli in daily use into their 
elements and to study the effects of each element 
in isolated form. To know, for instance, the ef- 
fects of caffein on the psychophysical activities 
does not mean to know the effects of tea or coffee, 
which contain a variety of other substances be- 
sides the caffein, substances which may be sup- 
posed to modify the effect of the caffein. Yet the 
first step must in this case be the study of the 
effects of the isolated caffein, before the total in- 
fluences of the familiar beverages can be followed 
up. An excellent investigation of this caffein 
effect on various psychological and psychomotor 
functions has recently been completed.** When 
232
-P-A-G-E-245
PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCES 
the caffein effect on tapping movements was 
studied, it was found that it works as a stimu- 
lation, sometimes preceded by a slight initial re- 
tardation. It persists from one to two hours after 
doses of from one to three grains and as long as 
four hours after doses of six grains. The steadi- 
ness test showed a slight nervousness after several 
hours after doses of from one to four grains. After 
six grains there is pronounced unsteadiness. A 
complex test in codrdination indicated that the 
effect of small amounts of caffein is a stimulation 
and that of large amounts a retardation. Cor- 
respondingly the speed of performance in type- 
writing is heightened by small doses of caffein 
and retarded by larger doses. In both cases the 
quality of the performance as measured by the 
number of errors is superior to the normal result. 
The influences of the physiological stimulants 
have many points of contact with the effects of 
social entertainment, the significance of which for 
the economic life is still rather unknown in any 
exact detail. Many factories in which the labor 
is noiseless, as in the making of cigars, have intro- 
duced gramophone music or reading aloud, and 
it is easy to understand theoretically that a cer- 
tain animating effect results, which stimulates the 
whole psychophysical activity. But only the ex- 
periment would be able to decide how this stimu- 
233 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
lation is related, for instance, to the distraction 
of attention, which is necessarily involved, or 
how it influences various periods of the work and 
various types of work, how far it is true that the 
musical key exerts an exciting or relaxing influ- 
ence, what intensity and what local position, 
what rhythm and what duration of such esthetic 
stimuli, would bring the best possible economic 
results. We all have read of the favorable effects 
which were secured in a factory when a cat was 
brought into every working-room in which wo- 
men laborers were engaged in especially fatigu- 
ing work. The cat became a living toy for the 
employees, which stimulated their social con- 
sciousness. In not a few plants the reinforced 
achievement is explained by the social means of 
entertainment which have been introduced under 
the pressure of modern philanthropic ideas. The 
lounging-rooms with the newspapers and peri- 
odicals, the clubrooms with libraries, the excur- 
sions and dances and patriotic festivities, fill up 
the reservoir of psychophysical energies. As a 
matter of course all the social movements which 
enhance the consciousness of solidarity among the 
laborers and the feeling of security as to their 
future development in their career have a similar 
effect of reinforcing the normal psychical achieve- 
ment.

PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCES 
As the strongest factor, finally, the direct 
material interest must be added to these condi- 
tions. The literature of political economy is full 
of discussions of the effect of increase of wages, 
of the payment of bonuses and premiums, of 
piece-wages, of promised pensions, and, as far as 
Europe is concerned, of state insurance. In short, 
the whole individual financial situation in its re- 
lation to the psychophysical achievement of the 
wage-earner is a favorite topic of economic in- 
quiry. We cannot participate here in these in- 
exhaustible discussions, because all these ques- 
tions are to-day still so endlessly far from the 
field of psychological experiments. Nevertheless 
we ought not to forget the experience through 
which general experimental psychology has gone 
in the last few decades. When the first experi- 
ments were undertaken in order to deal systemat- 
ically with the mental life, the friends of this new 
science and its opponents agreed, on the whole, 
in the belief that certainly only the most element- 
ary phenomena of consciousness, the sensations 
and the reactions of impulses, would be accessible 
to the new method. The opponents naturally 
compared this modest field with the great pro- 
blems of the mental totality, and therefore ridi- 
culed the new narrow task as unimportant. The 
friends, on the other hand, were eager to follow the 
235
-P-A-G-E-248
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
fresh path, because they were content to gain real 
exactitude by the experiment at least in these 
simplest questions. Yet as soon as the new in- 
dependent workshops were established for the 
young science, it was discovered that the method 
was able to open fields in which no one had antic- 
ipated its usefulness. The experiments turned to 
the problems of attention, of memory, of imag- 
ination, of feeling, of judgment, of character, of 
zesthetic experience and so on. It is not improb- 
able that the method of the economic psycholog- 
ical experiment may also quickly lead beyond the 
more elementary problems, as soon as it is syste- 
matically applied, and then it, too, may conquer 
regions of inquiry in which to-day no exact calcu- 
lation of the psychological factors seems possible. 
Tf such an advance is to be a steady one, the 
economic psychologist will emancipate himself 
from the chance question of what problems are 
at this moment important for commerce and in- 
dustry and will proceed systematically step by 
step from those results which the psychological 
laboratory has yielded under the non-economic 
points of view. Many previous psychological or 
psychophysical inquiries almost touch the pro- 
blems of industrial achievement. For instance, 
the experiments on imitation, which psycho- 
physicists have carried on in purely theoretical 
236
-P-A-G-E-249
  PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCES 
or pedagogical interests, move parallel to in- 
dustrial experiences. It is well known that the 
pacemaker plays his réle not only in the field 
of sport but also in the factory. The rhythm of 
one laborer gains controlling importance for 
the others, who instinctively imitate him. Some 
plants even have automatically working ma- 
chines with the special intention that the sharp 
rhythm of these lifeless forerunners shall produce 
an involuntary imitation in the psychophysical 
system. In a similar way many laboratory in- 
vestigations on suggestion and_ suggestibility 
point to such economic processes, and it seems 
to me that especially the studies on the influence 
of the ideas of purpose which are being under- 
taken nowadays in many psychological labora- 
tories may easily be connected with the problems 
of economic life. We know how the consciousness 
of the task to be performed has an organizing 
influence on the system of those psychophysical 
acts which lead to the goal. The experiment has 
shown under which conditions this effect can 
be reinforced and under which reduced. Peda- 
gogical experiments have also shown exactly 
what influence belongs to the consciousness of the 
approach to the end of work; the feeling of the 
nearness of the close heightens the achievement, 
even of the fatigued subject. It would not be 
237
-P-A-G-E-250
  THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK 
difficult to connect psychophysical experiments 
of this kind with the problems of the task and 
bonus system, which is nowadays so much dis- 
cussed in industrial life. The practical successes 
seem to prove that the individual can do more 
with equal effort if he does not stand before an un- 
limited mass of work of which he has to do as much 
as possible in the course of the day, but if he is 
before a definitely determined, limited task with 
the demand that he complete it in‘an exactly 
calculated time. Scientific management has made 
far-reaching use of this principle, but whether 
constant results for the various industries can be 
hoped for from such methods must again be as- 
certained by the psychological experiment. 
These hopes surely will not weaken the interest 
of the psychologist for those many psychological 
methods which lie outside of the experimental 
research. A sociologist, who himself had been a 
laborer in his earlier life, undertook in Germany 
last year an inquiry into the psychological status 
of the laborers’ achievement by the questionnaire 
method.*? He sent to 8000 workingmen in the 
mining industries, textile industries, and metal 
industries, blanks containing 26 questions, and 
received more than 5000 replies. The questions 
referred to the pleasure and interest in the work, 
to preferences, to fatigue, to the thoughts during 
238
-P-A-G-E-251
  PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCES 
the work, to the means of recreation, to the atti- 
tude toward the wages, to the emotional situa- 
tion, and so on. The 5000 answers allowed mani- 
fold classifications. The various mental types of 
men could be examined, the influence of the ma- 
chine, the attitude toward monotony, the changes 
of pleasure and interest in the work with the age 
of the laborer, the time at which fatigue becomes 
noticeable, and so on. Many psychological ele- 
ments of industrial life thus come to a sharp focus 
and the strong individual differences could not be 
brought out in a more characteristic way. Yet, 
all taken together, even such a careful investiga- 
tion on a psychostatistical basis strongly sug- 
gests that a few careful experimental investiga- 
tions could lead further than such a heaping-up 
of material gathered from men who are untrained 
in self-observation and in accurate reports, and 
above all who are accessible to any kind of sug- 
gestion and preconceived idea. The experimental 
method is certainly not the only one which can 
contribute to reforms in industrial life and the 
reinforcement of industrial efficiency, but all 
signs indicate that the future will find it the most 
productive and most reliable.

THE SATISFACTION OF ECONOMIC DEMANDS | 
VERY economic function comes in contact 
with the mental life of man, first from the 
fact that the work is produced by the psyche of 
personalities. This gave us the material for the 
first two parts of our discussion. We asked what 
mind is best fitted for the particular kind of work, 
and how the mind can be led to the best output 
of work. But it is evident that the real meaning 
of the economic process expresses itself in an en- 
tirely different contact between work and mind. 
The economic activity is separated from all other 
processes in the world, not by the fact that it 
involves labor and achievement by personalities, 
but by the fact that this labor satisfies a certain 
group of human desires which we acknowledge 
as economic. The mere performance of labor, with 
all the psychical traits of attention and fatigue 
and will-impulses and personal qualities, does not 
in itself constitute anything of economic value. 
243
-P-A-G-E-256
  THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
For instance, the sportsman who climbs a glacier 
also performs such a fatiguing activity which de- 
mands the greatest effort of attention and will; 
and yet the psychotechnics of sport do not belong 
in economic psychology, because this mountain 
climbing does not satisfy economic desires. The 
ultimate characteristic which designates an ac- 
tivity as economic is accordingly a certain effect 
on human souls. The whole whirl of the economic 
world is ultimately controlled by the purpose of 
satisfying certain psychical desires. Hence this 
psychical effect is still more fundamental for the 
economic process than its psychical origin in the 
mental conditions of the worker. The task of 
psychotechnics is accordingly to determine by 
exact psychological experiments how this mental 
effect, the satisfaction of economic desires, can 
be secured in the quickest, in the easiest, in the 
safest, in the most enduring, and in the most satis- 
factory way. 
' But we must not deceive ourselves as to the 
humiliating truth that so far not the slightest ef- 
fort has been made toward the answering of this 
central scientific question. If the inquiry into the 
psychical effects were really to be confined to this 
problem of the ultimate satisfaction of economic 
desires, scientific psychology could not contribute 
any results and could not offer anything but hopes 
244
-P-A-G-E-257
SATISFACTION OF ECONOMIC DEMANDS 
and wishes for the future. At the first glance it 
might appear as if just here a large amount of lite- 
rature exists; moreover, a literature rich in excel- 
lent investigations and ample empirical material. 
On the one side the political economists, with their 
theories of economic value and their investigations 
concerning the conditions of prices and the de- 
velopment of luxury, the calculation of economic 
values from pleasure and displeasure and many 
similar studies, have connected the economic pro- 
cesses with mental life; on the other side the 
philosophers, with their theories of value, have 
not confined themselves to the ethical and 
esthetic motives, but have gone deeply into the 
economic life too. While such studies of the econ- 
omists and of the philosophers are chiefly meant 
to serve theoretical understanding, it might seem 
easy to deduce from them technical practical 
prescriptions as well. If we know that under 
particular conditions certain demands will be 
satisfied, we draw the conclusion that we must 
realize those conditions whenever such demands 
are to be satisfied. The theoretical views of the 
economists and of the philosophers of value might 
thus be directly translated into psychotechnical 
advice. 
As soon as we look deeper into the situation, 
we must recognize that this surface impression 
245
-P-A-G-E-258
THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
is entirely misleading. Certainly whenever the 
philosophers or political economists discuss the 
problems of value and of the satisfaction of human 
demands, they are using psychological terms, but 
the whole meaning which they attach to these 
terms, feeling, emotion, will, desire, pleasure, dis- 
pleasure, joy, and pain, is essentially different 
from that which controls the causal explanations 
of scientific psychology. We cannot enter into the 
real fundamental questions here, which are too 
often carelessly ignored even in scientific quarters. 
Too often psychology is treated, even by psycho- 
logists, as if it covered every possible systematic 
treatment of inner experience, and correspond- 
ingly outsiders like the economists fancy that 
they are on psychological ground and are handling 
psychological conceptions as soon as they make 
any statements concerning the inner life. But if 
we examine the real purposes and presuppositions 
of the various sciences, we must recognize that 
the human experience can be looked on from two 
entirely different points of view. Only from one 
of the two does it present itself as psychological 
material and as a fit object for psychological 
study. From the other point of view, which is 
no less valuable and no less important for the 
understanding of our inner life, human experi- 
ence offers itself as a reality with which psychology 
246
-P-A-G-E-259
  ‘SATISFACTION OF ECONOMIC DEMANDS 
as such has nothing to do, even though it may 
be difficult to eliminate the usual psychological 
words. 
The psychologist considers human experience 
as a series of objects for consciousness. All the 
perceptions and memory ideas and imaginative 
ideas and feelings and emotions, are taken by 
him as mental objects of which consciousness 
becomes aware, and his task is to describe and to 
explain them and to find the laws for their suc- 
cession. He studies them as a naturalist studies 
the chemical elements or the stars. It makes no 
difference whether his explanation leads him to 
connect these mental contents with brain pro- 
cesses as one theory proposes, or with subcon- 
scious processes as another theory suggests. The 
entirely different aspect of inner life is the one 
which is most natural in our ordinary intercourse. 
Whenever we give an account of our inner life or 
are interested in the experience of our friends, we 
do not consider how their mental experiences as 
such objective contents of consciousness are to 
be described and explained, but we take them as 
inner actions and attitudes toward the world, and 
our aim is not to describe and to explain them but 
to interpret and to understand them. We do not 
seek their elements but their meaning, we do not 
seek their causes and effects but their inner rela- 
247
-P-A-G-E-260

tions and their inner purposes. In short, we do 
not take them at all as objects but as functions of 
the subject, and our dealing with them has no 
similarity to the method of the naturalist. 
This method of practical life in which we seek to 
express and to understand a meaning, and relate 
every will-act to its aim, is not confined to the 
mere popular aspect; it can lead to very systema- 
tic scholarly treatment. It is exactly the treat- 
ment which is fundamental in the case of all his- 
tory, for example, or of law, or of logic. That is, 
the historian makes us understand the meaning of 
a personality of the past and is really interested in 
past events only as far as human needs are to be 
interpreted. It would be pseudo-psychology, if we 
called such an account in the truly historical 
spirit a psychological description and explanation. 
The student of law interprets the meaning of the 
will of the legislator; he does not deal with the 
idea of the law as a psychological content. And 
the logician has nothing to do with the idea as a 
conscious object in the mind; he asks as to the 
inner relations of it and as to the conclusions from 
the premises. In short, wherever historical inter- 
pretations or logical deductions are needed, we 
move on in the sphere of human life as it presents 
itself from the standpoint of immediate true ex- 
perience without artificially moulding it into the 
248
-P-A-G-E-261
  SATISFACTION OF ECONOMIC DEMANDS 
conceptions of psychology. On the other hand, 
as soon as the psychological method is applied, 
this immediate life meaning of human experience 
is abandoned, and instead of it is gained the pos- 
sibility of considering the whole experience as a 
system of causes and effects. Mental life is then 
no longer what it is to us in our daily intercourse, 
because it is reconstructed for the purposes of this 
special treatment, just as the water which we 
drink is no longer our beverage if we consider it 
under the point of view of chemistry as a com- 
bination of hydrogen and oxygen. Hence we have 
not two statements one of which is true and the 
other ultimately untrue; on the contrary, both 
are true. We have a perfect right to give the value 
of truth to our experience with water as a refresh- 
ing drink, and also to the formula of the chemist. 
With a still better right we may claim that both 
kinds of mental experience are equally true. 
Hence not a word of objection is raised against 
the discussions of the historians and the philoso- 
phers, if we insist that their so-called psychology 
stands outside of the really descriptive and ex- 
planatory account of mental life, and is therefore 
not psychology in the technical sense of the 
word. 
It is this historical attitude which controls all 
the studies of the political economists. They 
249 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
speak of the will-acts of the individuals and of 
their demands and desires and satisfactions, but 
they do not describe and explain them; they want 
to interpret and understand them. They may 
analyze the motives of the laborer or of the manu- 
facturer, but those motives and impulses interest 
them not as contents of consciousness, but only 
as acts which are directed toward a goal. The aim 
toward which these point by their meaning, and 
not the elements from which they are made up 
or their causes and effects, is the substance of 
such economic studies. For such a subjective 
account of the meaning of actions the only pro- 
blem is, indeed, the correct understanding and in- 
terpretation, and the consistent psychologist who 
knows that it is not his task to interpret but to 
explain has no right to raise any questions here. 
It is, therefore, only a confusing disturbance, if 
a really psychological, causal explanation is mixed 
into the interpretation of such a system of will- 
acts and purposes. It is true we find this confusion 
in many modern works on economics. Econo- 
mists know that a scientific explanatory study of 
the human mind exists, and they have a vague 
feeling that they have no right to ignore this real 
psychology, instead of recognizing that the psy- 
chology really has nothing to do with their par- 
ticular problem. The result is that they constantly 
250 
   
-P-A-G-E-263
  
SATISFACTION OF ECONOMIC DEMANDS 
try to discuss the impulses and instincts, the 
hunger and thirst and sexual desire, and the 
higher demands for fighting and playing and ac- 
quiring, for seeking power and social influence, 
as a psychologist would discuss them, referring 
them to biological and physiological conditions 
and explaining them causally. Yet as soon as they 
come to their real problems and enter into the 
interpretation and meaning of these economic 
energies, they naturally slide back into the his- 
torical, economic point of view and discuss the 
economic relations of men without any reference 
to their psychologizing preambles. The applica- 
tion of the psychological, scientific method to the 
true economic experience is therefore not secured 
at all in this way. The demands and volitions 
which they disentangle are not the ones which the 
psychophysiologist studies, because they are left 
in their immediate form of life reality. They are 
accordingly inaccessible to the point of view of 
experimental psychology, and nothing can be ex- 
pected from such interpretative discussions of the 
economists for the psychotechnics at which the 
psychologist is aiming. Even where the political 
economists deal with the problems of value in 
exact language, nothing is gained for the kind of 
insight for which the psychologist hopes, and the 
psychologists must therefore go on with their 
251 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
own methods, if they are ever to reach a causal 
understanding of the means by which a satisfac- 
tion of the economic demands may be effected. 
So far the psychologists have not even started 
to examine these economic feelings, demands, and 
satisfactions with the means of laboratory psy- 
chology. Hence no one can say beforehand how 
it ought to be done and how to gain access to the 
important problems, inasmuch as the right formu- 
lation of the problem and the selection of the right 
method would here as everywhere be more than 
half of the solution. It must be left to the develop- 
ment of science for the right starting-point and the 
right methods to be discovered. Sometimes, to 
be sure, the experiment has at least approached 
this group of economic questions. For instance, 
the investigations of the so-called psychophysical 
law have often been brought into contact with 
the experiences of ownership and acquirement. 
The law, well known to every student of psycho- 
logy, is that the differences of intensity in two 
pairs of sensations are felt as equal, when the 
two pairs of stimuli are standing in the same re- 
lation. The difference between the intensities of 
the light sensations from 10 candles and 11 candles 
is equal to that from 50 candles and 55 candles, 
from 100 candles and 110, from 500 candles and 
550: that is, the difference of one additional can- 
252
-P-A-G-E-265
  SATISFACTION OF ECONOMIG DEMANDS 
dle between 10 and 11 appears just as great as the 
difference of 50 candles between 500 and 550. The 
psychologists have claimed thatina corresponding 
way the same feeling of difference arises when the 
amounts of possessions stand in the same relation. 
That is, the man who owns $100 feels the gain or 
loss of $1 as much as one who owns $100,000 feels 
the gain or loss of $1000. Not the absolute amount 
of the difference, but the relative value of the 
increase or decrease is the decisive influence on 
the psychological effect. Some experimental in- 
vestigations concerning feelings have also come 
near to the economic boundaries. The study of the contrast feelings and of the relativity of feel- 
ings, for instance, has points of contact with the 
economic problem of how far economic progress, 
with its stirring up and satisfying of continually 
new demands, really adds to the quantity of hu- 
man enjoyment. In other words, how far are 
those sociologists right who are convinced that 
by the technical complexity of modern life, with 
all its comforts and mechanizations, the level of 
individual life is raised, but that the oscillations 
about this average level remain the same and pro- 
duce the same amount of pleasure and pain? The 
technical advance would therefore bring no in- 
crease of human pleasure. 
We might also put into this class the meagre 
253
-P-A-G-E-266
  THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
experimental investigations concerning the mu- 
tual influence of feelings. When sound, light, and 
touch impressions, each of which, isolated, pro- 
duces a feeling of a certain degree, are combined 
with one another, the experiment can show very 
characteristic changes in the intensity of pleasure 
and displeasure. From such routine experiments 
of the laboratory it might not be difficult to come 
to more complex experiments on the mutual re- 
lations of feeling values and especially of the 
combinations of pleasure with displeasure. This 
would lead to an insight into the processes which 
are involved in the fixing of prices, as they are 
always dependent upon the pleasure in the ac- 
quisition and the displeasure in the outlay. The 
exact psychology of the future may thus very 
well determine the conditions under which the 
best effects for the satisfaction of economic de- 
mands may be secured, but our present-day science 
is still far from such an achievement: and it seems 
hardly justifiable to propose methods to-day, as it 
would be like drawing a map with detailed paths 
for a primeval forest which is still inaccessible.

WwW have said that the time has not yet 
come for discussing from the standpoint 
of experimental psychology the means to secure 
the ultimate effects of economic life, namely, the 
satisfaction of economic demands. If this were 
the only effect which had economic significance, 
this whole last part of our little book would have 
to remain a blank, as we wanted to deal here with 
the securing of the best effects after having studied 
the securing of the best man and of the best work. 
Yet these ultimate ends are certainly not the only 
mental effects which become important in the 
course of economic processes. In order to reach 
that final end of the economic movement, often 
an unlimited number of part processes distributed 
over space and time must codperate. The satis- 
faction of our thirst in a tea-room may be a trivial 
illustration of such a final effect, but it is clear 
that in order to produce this ultimate mental 
effect of satisfying the thirst, thousands of eco- 
nomic processes must have preceded. To bring 
the tea and the sugar and the lemon to the table, 
255

the porcelain cup and the silver spoon, wage- 
earners, manufacturers and laborers, exporters, 
importers, storekeepers, salesmen, and customers 
had to codperate. Among such part processes 
which serve the economic achievement are always 
many which succeed only if they produce charac- 
teristic effects in human minds. The propaganda 
which the storekeeper makes, for instance, his dis- 
play and his posters, serve the economic interplay 
by psychical effects without themselves satisfying 
any ultimate economic demand. They must at- 
tract the passer-by or impress the reader or stimu- 
late his impulse to buy, and through all this they 
reach an end which is in itself not final, as no hu- 
man desire to read advertisements exists. When 
the salesman influences the customer to buy 
something which may later help to satisfy a real 
economic demand, the art of his suggestive words 
secures a mental effect which again is in itself not 
ultimate. If the manufacturer influences his em- 
ployees to work with more attention or with 
greater industry, or if the community stirs up the 
desire for luxury or the tendency to saving, we 
have mental effects which are of economic im- 
portance without being really ultimate economic 
effects. 
As far as these effects are necessary and justi- 
fied stages leading to the ultimate satisfaction of 
256
-P-A-G-E-269
  THE EFFECTS OF ADVERTISEMENTS 
economic demands, it certainly is the duty of 
applied psychology to bring psychological experi- 
ence and exact methods into their service. We 
emphasize the necessary and justified character 
of these steps, as it is evident that psychological 
methods may be made use of also by those who 
aim toward mental effects which are unjustified 
and which are not necessary for the real satisfac- 
tion of valuable demands. Psychological laws can 
also be helpful in fraudulent undertakings or in 
advertisements for unfair competition. The psy- 
chotechnical scientist cannot be blamed if the re- 
sults of his experiments are misused for immoral 
purposes, just as the chemist is not responsible 
if chemical knowledge is aplied to the construc- 
tion of anarchistic bombs. But while psychology, 
as we have emphasized before, cannot from its 
own point of view determine the value of the end, 
the psychologist as a human being is certainly 
willing to codperate only where the soundness and 
correctness of the ends are evident from the point 
of view of social welfare. 
In order to demonstrate the principle of this 
kind of psychotechnical help with fuller detail, at 
least by one illustration, I may discuss the case 
of the advertisements, the more as this problem 
has already been taken up in a somewhat system- 
atic way by the psychological laboratories. We 
257
-P-A-G-E-270
  THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
have a number of careful experimental investiga- 
tions referring to the memory-value, the atten- 
tion-value, the suggestion-value, and other men- 
tal effects of the printed business advertisements. 
Of course this group of experimental investiga- 
tions at once suggests an objection which we can- 
not ignore. A business advertisement, as it ap- 
pears in the newspapers, is such an extremely 
trivial thing and so completely devoted to the 
egotistical desire for profit that it seems undigni- 
fied for the scientist to spend his time on such 
nothings and to shoot sparrows with his laboratory 
cannon-balls. But on the one side nothing can 
be unworthy of thorough study from a strictly 
theoretical point of view. The dirtiest chemical 
substance may become of greatest importance for 
chemistry, and the ugliest insect for zodlogy. On 
the other side, if the practical point of view of the 
applied sciences is taken, the importance of the 
inquiry may stand in direct relation to the intens- 
ity of the human demand which is to be satisfied 
by the new knowledge. Present-day society is so 
organized that the economic advertisement surely 
serves a need, and its intensity is expressed by the 
well-known fact that in every year billions are 
paid for advertising. Measured by the amount 
of expenditure, advertising has become one of the 
largest and economically most important human

industries. It is, then, not astonishing that scien- 
tists consider it worth while to examine the exact 
foundations of this industry, but it is surprising 
that this industry could reach such an enormous 
development without being guided by the spirit 
of scientific exactitude which appears a matter 
of course in every other large business. As it isa 
function of science to study the physics of incan- 
descent lamps or gas motors so as to bring the 
economically most satisfactory devices into the 
service of the community, it cannot be less im- 
portant from the standpoint of national economics 
to study scientifically the efficiency of the adver- 
tisements in order that the national means may 
in this industry, too, secure the greatest possible 
effects. It is only a secondary point that experi- 
ments of this kind are of high interest to the theo- 
retical scientist as well. For us the advertisement 
is simply an instrument constructed to satisfy 
certain human demands by its effects on the mind. 
It is a question for psychology to determine the 
conditions under which this instrument may be 
best adapted to its purpose. 
The mental effect of a well-adapted advertise- 
ment is manifold. It appeals to the memory. 
Whatever we read at the street corner, or in the 
pages of the newspaper or magazine, is not printed 
with the idea that we shall immediately turn to 
259  
-P-A-G-E-272
  THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
the store, but first of all with the expectation that 
we keep the content of the advertisement in our 
memory for a later purchase. It will therefore be 
the more valuable the more vividly it forces itself 
on the memory. But if practical books about the 
art of advertising usually presuppose that this 
influence on the memory will be proportionate to 
the effect on the attention, the psychologist can- 
not fully agree. The advertisement may attract 
the attention of the reader strongly and yet by its 
whole structure may be unfit to force on the mem- 
ory its characteristic content, especially the name 
of the firm and of the article. The pure memory- 
value is especially important, as according to a 
well-known psychological law the pleasure in 
mere recognition readily attaches itself to the rec- 
ognized object. The customer who has the choice 
among various makes and brands in the store 
may not have any idea how far one is superior to 
another, but the mere fact that one among them 
bears a name which has repeatedly approached 
his consciousness before through advertisements 
is sufficient to arouse a certain warm feeling of ac- 
quaintance, and by a transposition of feeling this 
pleasurable tone accentuates the attractiveness 
of that make and leads to its selection. This in- 
direct help through the memory-value is econom- 
ically no less important than the direct service. 
260
-P-A-G-E-273
THE EFFECTS OF ADVERTISEMENTS 
In order to produce a strong effect on memory 
the advertisement must be easily apprehensible. 
Psychological laboratory experiments with exact 
time-measurement of the grasping of various ad- 
vertisements of the same size for the same arti- 
cle, but in different formulations, demonstrated 
clearly how much easier or harder the apprehen- 
sion became through relatively small changes. 
No mistake in the construction of the advertise- 
ment causes so much waste as a grouping which 
makes the quick apperception difficult. The color, 
the type, the choice of words, every element, 
allows an experimental analysis, especially by 
means of time-measurement. If we determine 
in thousandths of a second the time needed to 
recognize the characteristic content of an adver- 
tisement, we may discriminate differences which 
would escape the naive judgment, and yet which 
in practical life are of considerable consequence, as 
the effect of a deficiency is multiplied by the 
number of readers. 
We must insist on the further demand that the 
advertisement make a vivid impression, so that it 
may influence the memory through its vividness. 
Size is naturally the most frequent condition for 
the increase of vividness, but only therelative size 
is decisive. The experiment shows that the full- 
page advertisement in a folio magazine does not 
261 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
influence the memory more than the full page in 
a quarto magazine, if the reader is for the time 
adjusted to the particular size. No less important 
than the size is the originality and the unusual 
form, the vivid color, the skillful use of empty 
spaces, the associative elements, the appeal to 
humor or to curiosity, to sympathy or to anti- 
pathy. Every emotion can help to impress the 
content of the advertisement on the involuntary 
memory. Unusual announcements concerning 
the prices or similar factors move in the same 
direction. 
Together with the question of the apprehension 
and the vividness of the impression, we must 
acknowledge the frequency of repetition as an 
equally important factor. We know from daily 
life how an indifferent advertisement can force 
itself on our mind, if it appears daily in the same 
place in the newspaper or is visible on every 
street corner. But the psychologically decisive 
factor here is not the fact of the mere repetition 
of the impression, but rather the stimulation of 
the attention which results from the repetition. 
If we remained simply passive and received the 
impression the second and third and fourth time 
with the same indifference with which we noticed 
it the first time, the mere summation would not 
be sufficient for a strong effect. But the second 
262
-P-A-G-E-275
THE EFFECTS OF ADVERTISEMENTS 
impression awakes the consciousness of recogni- 
tion, thus exciting the attention, and through it 
we now turn actively to the repeated impression 
which forces itself on our memory with increased 
vividness on account of this active personal 
reaction. 
We may consider how such factors can be 
tested by the psychotechnical experiment. Scott, 
for instance, studied the direct influence of the 
relative size of the advertisements.*° He con- 
structed a book of a hundred pages from ad- 
vertisements which had been cut from various 
magazines and which referred to many different 
articles. Fifty persons who did not know any- 
thing about the purpose of the experiment had to 
glance over the pages of the book as they would 
look though the advertising parts of a monthly. 
The time which they used for it was about ten 
minutes. As soon as they had gone through the 
hundred pages, they were asked to write down 
what they remembered. The result from this 
method was that the 50 persons mentioned on an 
average every full-page advertisement 6} times, 
every half-page less than 3 times, every fourth- 
page a little more than 1 time, and the still smaller 
advertisements only about } time. This series of 
experiments suggested accordingly that the mem- 
ory value of a fourth-page advertisement is much 
: 263 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
    
THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT: 
smaller than one fourth of the memory-value of a 
full-page advertisement, and that of an eighth- 
page again much smaller than one half of the 
psychical value of a fourth-page. The customer 
who pays for one eighth of a page receives not the 
eighth part, but hardly the twentieth part of the 
psychical influence which is produced by a full 
page. 
These experiments, which were carried on in 
various forms,demanded as a natural supplement 
a study of the effects of repetition in relation to 
size. This was the object of a series of tests which 
I carried on recently in the Harvard laboratory. 
I constructed the following material: 60 sheets 
of Bristol board in folio size were covered with 
advertisements which were cut from magazines 
the size of the “Saturday Evening Post” and 
the “ Ladies’ Home Journal.” We used advertise- 
ments ranging from full-page to twelfth-page in 
size. Every one of the 6 full-page advertisements 
which we used occurred only once, each of the 12 
half-page advertisements was given 2 times, each 
of the fourth-page size, 4 times, each of the eighth- 
page size, 8 times, and each of the twelfth-page 
size, 12 times. The repetitions were cut from 12 
copies of the magazine number. The same adver- 
tisement never occurred on the same page; every 
page, unless it was covered by a full-page adver- 
264
-P-A-G-E-277
  
THE EFFECTS OF ADVERTISEMENTS 
tisement, offered a combination of various an- 
nouncements. It is evident that by this arrange- 
ment every single advertisement occupied the 
same space, as the 8 times repeated eighth-page 
advertisement filled a full page too. Thus no one 
of the 60 announcements which we used was spa- 
tially favored above another. 
Thirty persons took part in the experiment. 
Each one had to devote himself to the 60 pages 
in such a way that every page was looked at for 
exactly 20 seconds. Between each two pages was 
a pause of 3 seconds, sufficient to allow one sheet 
to be laid aside and the next to be grasped. In 23 
minutes the whole series had been gone through, 
and immediately after that every one had to write 
down what he remembered, both the names of the 
firms and the article announced. In the cases 
where only the name or only the article was cor- 
rectly remembered, the result counted 3. We 
found great individual differences, probably not 
only because the memory of the different persons 
was different, but also because they varied in the 
degree of interest with which they looked at such 
material. The smallest number of reproductions 
was 18, of which 14 were only half remembered, 
that is, only the name or only the article, and as 
we counted these half reproductions 4, the mem- 
ory-value for this person was counted 11. The 
265
-P-A-G-E-278
    
THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
maximum reproduction was 46, of which 6 were 
half remembered. 
If these calculated values are added and the 
sum divided by the number of participants, that 
is, 30, and this finally by the number of the adver- 
tisements shown, that is, 60, we obtain the aver- 
age memory-value of a single advertisement. The 
results showed that this was 0.44. But our real 
interest referred to the distribution for the ad- 
vertisements of different size. If we make the 
same calculation, not for the totality of the ad- 
vertisements but for those of a particular size, we 
find that the memory-value for the full-page ad- 
vertisement was 0.33, for the 2 times repeated 
half-page advertisement, 0.30, for the 4 times re- 
peated fourth-page advertisement 0.49, for the 8 
times repeated eighth-page advertisement, 0.44, 
and for the 12 times repeated twelfth-page adver- 
tisement, 0.47. Hence we come to the result that 
the 4 times repeated fourth-page advertisement as 
1; times stronger memory-value than one offer- 
ing of a full-page, or the 2 times repeated half- 
page, but that this relation does not grow with a 
further reduction of the size. Two thirds of the 
subjects were men and one third women. On the 
whole, the same relation exists for both groups, 
but the climax of psychical efficiency was reached 
in the case of the men by the 4 times repeated 
266
-P-A-G-E-279
  
THE EFFECTS OF ADVERTISEMENTS 
fourth-page, in the case of the women by the 8 
times repeated eighth-page. The 4 times repeated 
fourth-page in the case of the women was 0.45, 
in the case of the men, 0.51, the 8 times repeated 
eighth-page, women, 0.53, men, 0.37. 
I am inclined to believe that the ascent of the 
curve of the memory-value from the full-page to 
the fourth-page or eighth-page would have been 
still more continuous, if the whole-page adver- 
tisements had not naturally been such as are best 
known to the American reader. The whole-page 
announcement, therefore, had a certain natural 
advantage. But when we come to another calcu- 
lation, even the effect of this advantage is lost. 
We examined the relations for the first 10 names 
and articles, which every one of the 30 persons 
wrote down. These first 10 were mostly dashed 
down quickly without special thought. They also 
included only a few half reproductions. When we 
study these 300 answers which the 30 persons 
wrote as their first 10 reproductions, and calcu- 
late from them the chances which every one of 
the 60 advertisements had for being remembered, 
we obtain the following values: The probability 
of being remembered among the first 10 was for 
the full-page advertisement, 0.5, for the half-page 
2 times repeated, 1.2, for the fourth-page 4 times 
repeated, 2.9, for the eighth-page 8 times repeated, 
267 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
    THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
2.3, and for the twelfth-page 12 times repeated, 
2.4. The superiority of repetition over mere size 
appears most impressively in this form, but we 
see again in this series that the effect decreases 
even with increased number of repetitions as 
soon as the single advertisement sinks below a 
certain relative size, so that the 12 times repeated 
twelfth-page advertisement does not possess the 
memory-value of the 4 times repeated fourth-page 
advertisement. If Scott’s experiments concern- 
ing the size and these experiments of mine con- 
cerning the repetition are right, the memory-value 
of the advertisements for economic purposes is 
dependent upon complicated conditions. A busi- 
ness man who brings out a full-page advertise- 
ment once in a paper which has 100,000 readers 
would leave the desired memory-impression on 
a larger number of individuals than if he were to 
print a fourth-page advertisement in four differ- 
ent cities in four local papers, each of which has 
100,000 readers. But if he uses the same paper in 
one town, he would produce a much greater effect 
by printing a fourth of a page four times than by 
using a full-page advertisement once only. 
As a matter of course this would hold true only 
as far as size and repetition are concerned. Many 
other factors have to be considered besides. Some 
of these could even be studied with our material. 
268
-P-A-G-E-281
  THE EFFECTS OF ADVERTISEMENTS 
We could study from our results what memory- 
value is attached to the various forms of type or 
suggestive words, what influence to illustrations, 
how far they reinforce the impressiveness and 
how far they draw away the attention from the 
name and the object, how these various factors 
influence men and women differently, and so on. 
Other questions, however, demand entirely differ- 
ent forms of experiment. We may examine the 
effects of special contrast phenomena, of unusual 
background, of irregular borders and original 
headings. The particular position of the adver- 
tisement also deserves our psychological interest. 
The magazines receive higher prices for the cover 
pages and the newspapers for advertisements 
which are surrounded by reading matter. In 
both cases obvious practical motives are decisive. 
The cover page comes into the field of vision more 
frequently. What is surrounded by reading mat- 
ter is less easily overlooked. 
But the newspaper world hardly realizes how 
much other variations of position influence the psychological effect. Starch *! made experiments 
in which he did not use real advertisements, but meaningless syllables so as to exclude the in- 
fluence of familiarity with any announcement. 
He arranged little booklets, each of 12 pages, on 
which a syllable such as lod, zan, mep, dut, yib, 
269
-P-A-G-E-282
  THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
and so on was printed in the middle of each page. 
Each of his 50 subjects glanced over the book and 
then wrote down what syllables remained in mem- 
ory. He found that the syllables which stood on 
the first and last page were remembered by 34 per- 
sons, those on the second and eleventh by about 26, 
and those on the eight other pages by an average 
of 17 persons. In the next experiment he printed 
one syllable in the middle of the upper and one 
in the middle of the lower half of each page. The 
results now showed that of those syllables which 
were remembered 54 per cent stood on the upper 
half and 46 per cent on the lower half of the page. 
Finally, he divided every page into four parts and 
printed one syllable on the middle of each fourth 
of a page. The results showed that of the remem- 
bered syllables 28 per cent stood on the left-hand 
upper fourth, 33 per cent on the right-hand upper 
fourth, 16 per cent left-hand lower, and 23 per 
cent right-hand lower. A fourth-page advertise- 
ment which is printed on the outer side of the 
upper half of the page thus probably has more 
than twice the psychological value of one which is 
printed on the inner side of the lower half. The 
economic world spends millions every year for 
advertisements on the upper right-hand side and 
millions for advertisements on the lower left-hand 
side, and is not aware that one represents twice 
270

the value of the other. These little illustrations of 
advertisement experiments may suffice to indi- 
cate how much haphazard methods are still pre- 
valent in the whole field of economic psychotech- 
nics, methods which would not be tolerated in the 
sphere of physical and chemical technology.

THE EFFECT OF DISPLAY 
F we turn from the simple newspaper adver- 
tisement to the means of propaganda in gen- 
eral, we at once stand before a question which is 
often wrongly answered. The practical handbooks 
of advertisements and means of display treat 
it as a self-evident fact that every presentation 
should be as beautiful as possible. In the first 
place, we cannot deny that the ugly and even the 
disgusting possess a strong power for attracting 
attention. Yet it is true that by a transposition of 
feelings the displeasure in the advertisement may 
easily become a displeasure in the advertised ob- 
ject. But, on the other hand, it is surely a mis- 
take to believe that pure beauty best fulfills the 
function of the advertisement. Even the drafts- 
man who draws a poster ought to give up the am- 
bition to create a perfect picture. It might have 
the power to attract attention, but it would 
hardly serve its true purpose of fixing the atten- 
tion on the article which is advertised by the 
picture. The very meaning of beauty lies in its 
self-completeness. The beautiful picture rests 
in itself and does not point beyond itself. A really 
272 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
    THE EFFECT OF DISPLAY 
beautiful landscape painting is an end in itself, 
and must not stir up the practical wish to visit 
the landscape which has stimulated the eye of the 
painter. If the display is to serve economic inter- 
ests, every line and every curve, every form and 
every color, must be subordinated to the task of 
leading to a practical resolution, and to an action, 
and yet this is exactly the opposite of the meaning 
of art. Art must inhibit action, if it is perfect. 
The artist is not to make us believe that we deal 
with a real object which suggests a practical atti- 
tude. The esthetic forms are adjusted to the main 
esthetic aim, the inhibition of practical desires. 
The display must be pleasant, tasteful, harmoni- 
ous, and suggestive, but should not be beautiful, 
if it is to fulfill its purpose in the fullest sense. It 
loses its economic value, if by its artistic quality 
it oversteps the boundaries of that middle region 
of arts and crafts. This of course stands in no 
contradiction to the requirement that the adver- 
tised article should be made to appear as beauti- 
ful as possible. The presentation of something 
beautiful is not necessarily a beautiful presenta- 
tion, just as a perfectly beautiful picture need 
not have something beautiful as its content. A 
perfect painting may be the picture of a most 
ugly person. 
We have not yet spoken of the suggestive 
273
-P-A-G-E-286
  THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
power of the means of propaganda. Every one 
knows how the influence on taste and smell, on 
social vanity, on local pride, on the gambling in- 
stinct, on the instinctive fear of diseases, and 
above all on the sexual instinct, can gain sug- 
gestive power. Everywhere among the uncritical 
masses such appeals reach individuals whose psy- 
chophysical attitudes make such influences vivid 
and overpowering. Every one knows, too, those 
often clever linguistic forms which are to aid 
the suggestion. They are to inhibit the opposing 
impulses. The mere use of the imperative, to be 
sure, has gradually become an ineffective, used- 
up pattern. It is a question for special economic 
psychotechnics to investigate how the suggestive 
strength of a form can be reinforced or weakened 
by various secondary influences. What influence, 
for example, belongs to the electric sign advertise- 
ments in which the sudden change from light to 
darkness produces strong psychophysical effects, 
and what value belongs to moving parts in the 
picture? 
The psychologist takes the same interest in 
the examples of window displays, sample dis- 
tributions, and similar vehicles of commerce by 
which the offered articles themselves and not 
their mere picture or description are to influence 
the consciousness of the prospective customer. 
274
-P-A-G-E-287
  THE EFFECT OF DISPLAY 
Here, too, every element may be isolated and may 
be brought under psychotechnical rules. The most 
external question would refer to the mere quan- 
tity of the presented material. The psychologist 
would ask how the mere mass of the offering in- 
fluences the attention, how far the feeling of 
pleasure in the fullness, how far the esthetic im- 
‘pression of repetition, how far the associative 
thought of a manifold selection, how far the mere 
spatial expansion, affects the impression. In any 
case, as soon as it is acknowledged as desirable to 
produce with certain objects the impression of 
the greatest possible number, the experimental 
psychologist stands before the concrete problem 
of how a manifoldness of things is to be distrib- 
uted so that it will not be underestimated, per- 
haps even overestimated as to quantity. Again, 
the laboratory experiment would not proceed 
with real window displays or real exhibitions, but 
would work out the principle with the simplified 
experimental means. 
An investigation in the Harvard laboratory, 
for instance, tested the influence which various 
factors have upon the estimation of a number 
of objects seen.’? The question was how far 
the form or the size or the distribution makes a 
group of objects appear larger or smaller. The 
experiment was started by showing 20 small cards 
275
-P-A-G-E-288
  THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
on a black background in comparison with another 
group of cards the number of which varied be- 
tween 17 and 23. At first the form of these little 
cards was changed: triangles, squares, and circles 
were tried. Or the color was changed: light and 
dark, saturated and unsaturated colors were 
used. Or the order was varied: sometimes the 
little cards lay in regular rows, sometimes in 
close clusters, sometimes widely distributed, 
sometimes in quite irregular fashion. Or the 
background was changed, or the surrounding 
frame, or the time of exposure, and so on. Each 
time the subjects had to estimate whether the 
second group was the larger or equal or the smaller. 
These experiments indicated that such compara- 
tive estimation was indeed influenced by every 
one of the factors mentioned. If the experiments 
show that an irregular distribution makes the 
number appear larger or a close clustering re- 
duces the apparent number, and so on, the busi- 
ness man would be quite able to profit from such 
knowledge. The jeweler who shows his rings and 
watches in his window wishes to produce with his 
small stock the impression of an ample supply. 
He lacks the psychology which might teach him 
whether he would act more wisely in having the 
rings and the watches separated, or whether he 
should mix the two, whether he ought to choose 
276
-P-A-G-E-289
THE EFFECT OF DISPLAY 
a background which is similar in color or one 
which contrasts with the pieces exhibited, 
whether he ought to present the single object in 
a special background as in a case, or to show it 
without one. He is not aware that by simple psy- 
chological illusions, it is not difficult to change 
the apparent size of an isolated object by special 
treatment, making his show-piece appear larger 
by a fitting background or intentionally making 
a dainty object appear smaller by contrasting 
surroundings. These, to be sure, are very trivial 
illustrations, but the same fundamental psycho- 
logical laws which are true for the show-window 
of the next corner store are true for the world- 
display of the nation. The point is to present : 
clearly the idea, which can be most simply ex- 
pressed in such trivial material. But it may be 
added that even in the case of the most indiffer- 
ent example a few hasty experiments with one or 
two subjects cannot yield any results of value. 
All parts of physiological psychological optics 
can contribute similar material. The questions 
of color harmony and color contrast, light inten- 
sity and mutual support of uniformly colored 
objects, of irradiation, depth and perspective, are 
significant for an effective display in the show- 
window, and the laboratory results can easily 
be translated into psychotechnical prescriptions. 
277 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
But here it is still more necessary to separate 
carefully the merely optical aspect of the impres- 
sion from its esthetic side. All that we claimed 
as to the poster is still more justified for the pre- 
sentation of the saleable objects themselves. As 
_ Soon as the display of the articles forms areal work 
of art, it must produce inhibitions in the soul of 
the spectator by which the practical economic 
desire is turned aside. Beauty here too has strong 
power of attraction, and moreover the suggestive 
power, by which it withdraws our senses from the 
chance surroundings, forces us to lose ourselves 
in the offered presentation. But just through this 
process the content of the display becomes iso- 
lated and separated from the world of our prac- 
tical interests. Our desires are brought to silence, 
we do not seek a personal relation to the things 
which we face as admiring spectators, and the 
intended economic effect is therefore eliminated. 
Whoever is to examine the psychotechnics of 
displays and exhibitions must therefore study 
the psychology of esthetic stimulation, of sug- 
gestion, of the effects of light, color, form and 
movement, of apperception and attention, and 
ought not to forget the psychology of humor and 
curiosity, of instincts and emotions. For us the 
essential point is that here too the experimental 
psychological method alone is able to lead from 
278
-P-A-G-E-291
  THE EFFECT OF DISPLAY 
mere chance arrangements founded on personal 
taste to the systematic construction which secures 
with the greatest possible certainty the greatest 
possible mental effect in the service of the econ- 
omic purpose. 
The problems of the storekeeper who arranges 
his windows, however, overlap the problems of 
the manufacturer who prepares his goods for the 
world-market, and who must from the start take 
care that the outer appearance of his goods stimu- 
late the readiness to buy. In factories in which 
these questions have been carefully considered, the 
psychological elements have always been found 
to be the most influential, but often the most 
puzzling. I received material from a number 
of industrial plants which sold the same article 
in a variety of packings. The material which 
was sent to me included all kinds of soaps and 
candies, writing-papers and breakfast foods, and 
other articles which are handled by the retailer, 
the sale of which depends upon the inclination 
and caprice of the customer in the store. For every 
one of these objects a number of external covers 
and labels were sent and with them a confidential 
report with details about their relative success. 
For instance, a certain kind of chocolate was sold under 12 different labels. One of them was 
highly successful in the whole country, and one 
279
-P-A-G-E-292
THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
other had made the same article entirely unsale- 
able. The other 10 could be graded between these 
extremes. In all 12 cases the covers were deco- 
rated with pictures of women with a scenic back- 
ground. As long as only esthetic values were 
considered, all were on nearly the same level, 
and esthetically skilled observers repeatedly ex- 
pressed their preference for some of the unsuccess- 
ful pictures over some of the successful ones. But 
as soon as. an internal relation was formed between 
the pictures and the chocolate, in the one case a 
mental harmony resulted which had strong sug- 
gestive power, in the other case a certain unrest 
and inner disturbance which necessarily had an 
inhibiting influence. The picture which was un- 
successful with the sweets would perhaps have 
been eminently successful for tobacco. From 
such elementary starting-points, the laboratory 
experiment might proceed systematically into 
spheres of economic life hitherto untouched by 
scientific methods. The psychology of the influ- 
ence of external forms on the conscious reactions 
of the masses is so far usually considered only 
when, as often happens, the most fundamental 
demands are violated; for instance, when objects 
which are to give the impression of ease are 
painted in colors which give a heavy, clumsy ap- 
pearance, or vice versa, when book-bindings are

of the title impossible for a passer-by, and many 
similar antipsychological absurdities which any 
stroll through the streets of a modern city forces

EXPERIMENTS WITH REFERENCE TO 
ILLEGAL IMITATION 
T is perhaps not without interest to turn into 
a by-path at this point of our road. All the 
illustrations which we have picked out so far 
have referred to strictly economic conditions. But 
we ought not to forget that these economic pro- 
blems of commerce and industry are everywhere 
in contact with legal interests as well. In order 
to indicate the manifoldness of problems acces- 
sible to the experimental method, we may discuss 
our last question, the question of packing and 
of labels, in this legal relation too. All the pack- 
ings, covers, labels, trademarks, and names by 
which the manufacturer tries to stimulate the 
attention, the imagination, and the suggestibility 
of the customer may easily draw a large part of 
their psychological effectiveness from without, 
as soon as they imitate the appearance of articles 
which are well introduced and favored in the 
market. If the public is familiar with and favor- 
ably inclined toward an article on account of its 
inner values or on account of its being much ad- 
282
-P-A-G-E-295
ILLEGAL IMITATION 
vertised, a similar name or a similar packing may 
offer efficient help to a rival article. The law of 
course protects the label and the deceiving imi- 
tation can be prosecuted. But no law can deter- 
mine by general conceptions the exact point at 
which the similarity becomes legally unallowable. 
This creates a situation which has given rise to 
endless difficulties in practical life. 
If everything were forbidden which by its 
similarity to an accredited article might lead to a 
possible confusion in the mind of the quite care- 
less and inattentive customer, any article once in 
the market would have a monopoly in its line. 
As soon as a typewriter or an automobile or a 
pencil or a mineral water existed, no second kind 
could have access to the market, as with a high 
degree of carelessness one economic rival may be 
taken for another, even if the new typewriter 
or the new pencil has a new form and color and 
name. On the other side, the purchaser could 
never have a feeling of security if imitations were 
considered as still legally justifiable when the 
difference is so small that it needs an intense 
mental effort and careful examination of details 
to notice it. 
The result is that the jurisdiction fluctuates be- 
tween these two extremes in a most alarming way, 
and this seems to hold true in all countries. In 
283
-P-A-G-E-296
  THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
theory: “There is substantial agreement that in- 
fringement occurs when the marks, names, la- 
bels, or packings of one trader resemble those of 
another sufficiently to make it probable that or- 
dinary purchasers, exercising no more care than 
such persons usually do in purchasing the article 
in question, will be deceived.” But it depends 
upon the trade experts and the judges to give 
meaning to such a statement in the particular 
ease, as the amount of care which purchasers 
usually exercise can be understood very differ- 
ently. Sometimes the customer is expected to 
proceed with an attention which is most subtly 
adjusted to the finest differences, and sometimes 
it is taken for granted that he is unable to notice 
even strong variations. It is clear that this un- 
certainty which disturbs the whole trade cannot 
be eliminated as long as the psychological back- 
ground has not been systematically studied. 
Mere talking about the attention of the customer, 
and his ability to decide and select, and of his ob- 
servations and his habits in the spirit of popular 
common-sense psychology, can never secure exact 
standards and definite demarcation lines. The 
question is important not only where imitations 
of morally doubtful character are in the market. 
Even the most honest manufacturer is in a cer- 
tain sense obliged to imitate his predecessors, 
284
-P-A-G-E-297
  
ILLEGAL IMITATION 
as they have directed the taste and habits of 
the public in particular directions, and as the 
product of his company would suffer unneces- 
sarily if he were to disregard this psychical at- 
titude of the prospective customers. The econo- 
mic legal situation accordingly suggests the 
question whether it would not be possible to de- 
vise methods for an exact measurement of the 
permissible similarity, and this demand for 
exactitude naturally points to the methods of 
the psychological experiment. E. S. Rogers, 
Esq., of Chicago, who has thoroughly discussed 
the legal aspect of the problem,®* first turned 
my attention to the psychological difficulty in- 
volved. 
When I approached the question in the Har- 
vard psychological laboratory, it was clear to 
me that the degree of attention and carefulness 
which the court may presuppose on the part of 
the customer can never be determined by the 
psychologist and his experimental methods. It 
would be meaningless, if we tried to discover 
by experiments a particular degree of similarity 
which every one ought to recognize or a particular 
degree of attention which would be sufficient for 
protection against fraud. Such degrees must al- 
ways remain dependent upon arbitrary decision. 
They are not settled by natural conditions, but 
285
-P-A-G-E-298
  THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
are entirely dependent upon social agreement. A 
decision outside of the realm of psychology must 
fix upon a particular degree in the scale of various 
similarity values as the limit which is not to be 
passed. The aim of the psychologist can be only 
to construct such a scale by which decisions may 
be made comparable and by which standards 
may become possible. The experiment cannot 
deduce from the study of mental phenomena 
what degrees of similarity ought to be still ad- 
missible, but it may be able to develop methods 
by which different degrees of similarity can be 
discriminated and by which a certain similarity 
value once selected can always be found again 
with objective certainty. After many fruitless 
efforts I settled on the following form of experi- 
ments, which I hope may bring us nearer to the 
attainment of the purpose. 
A group of objects is observed for a definite 
time and after a definite interval another group 
of objects is offered for comparison. This-second 
group is identical with the first in all but one of 
the objects, and this is replaced by a similar one. 
The question is how often this substitution will 
be noticed by the observers. I may give in detail 
a characterization of the set of experiments in 
which we are at present engaged. We are work- 
ing with picture postal cards, using many hun- 
286
-P-A-G-E-299
  
ILLEGAL IMITATION 
dred cards of different kinds, but for each one we 
have one or several similar cards. As postal cards 
are generally manufactured in sets, it is not diffi- 
cult to purchase pairs of pictures with any degree 
of similarity. Two cards with Christmas trees, 
or two with Easter eggs, or two with football 
players, or two with forest landscapes, and so on, 
may differ all the way from a slight variation of 
color or a hardly noticeable change in the position 
of details to variations which keep the same mo- 
tive or the same general arrangement, but after all 
make the card strikingly different. The first step 
is to determine for each pair the degree of simi- 
larity, on a percentage basis. To overcome mere 
arbitrariness, we ask thirty to forty educated per- 
sons to express the similarity value, calling iden- 
tical postal cards 100 per cent and two postal 
cards as different as a colored flower piece and a 
black picture of a street scene 0. The average 
value of these judgments is then considered as 
expressing the objective degree of similarity be- 
tween the two pictures of a pair. After securing 
such standard values, we carry on the experiments 
in the following form. Six different postal cards, 
for instance, are seen on a black background 
through the opening of a shutter which is closed 
after 5 seconds. The six may be made up of a 
landscape, a building, a head, a genre scene, and 
287
-P-A-G-E-300
  THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
so forth. After 20 seconds the same group of pos- 
tal cards is shown once more, except that one is 
replaced by a similar one, instead of one church 
another church building, or instead of a vase with 
roses a vase with pinks. If the substituted picture 
has the average similarity value of 80 per cent and 
we make the experiment with 10 persons, the sub- 
stitution may be discovered by 7 persons and re- 
main unnoticed by 8. We can now easily vary 
every one of the factors involved. If instead of 6 
cards, we take 10, it may be that only 4 out of 10 
persons, instead of 7, will discover the substitution, 
while if we take 4 cards instead of 6, perhaps 9 per- 
sons out of 10 will recognize the difference under 
these otherwise equal conditions. Only an espe- 
cially careless observer will overlook it. But in- 
stead of changing the number of objects, we may 
change the periods of exposure. If we show the 
6 cards only for 2 seconds instead of 5 seconds, 
the number of those who recognize the difference 
may sink from 7 to 5 or 4, and if we make the time 
considerably longer, we shall of course reach a 
point where all 10 will recognize the substitu- 
tion. The same holds true of the shortening or 
lengthening of the time-interval between the two 
presentations. The third variable factor is the 
similarity itself. If instead of one church, not an- 
other church, but a theatre or a skyscraper is 
288
-P-A-G-E-301
  
ILLEGAL IMITATION 
shown, that is, if the similarity value of 80 per 
cent sinks down to a similarity of 60 per cent or 
50 per cent, the number of those who recognize 
the substitution will again become larger; if, on 
the other hand, the substituted card shows the 
same church, only from a slightly different angle, 
bringing the similarity value up to 90 per cent or 
95 per cent, the number of observers who recog- 
nize the substitution may sink to 2 or 3. To make 
the experiments reliable, it is also necessary fre- 
quently to mix in cases in which no substitution 
at all is introduced. 
If these experiments are varied sufficiently and 
a large mass of material brought together, we 
must be able to secure definite formule. We may 
find that if the critical card appears among 6 
cards, is shown for 5 seconds, and the group is 
again exposed after 20 seconds, 80 per cent of the 
subjects will recognize the substitution of a similar 
card, if the degree of similarity is 30 per cent, but 
only 60 per cent will recognize it if the degree of 
similarity is '70 per cent, and only 30 per cent will 
recognize itif the degree of similarity is 90 per cent. 
These are entirely fictitious figures and are only to 
indicate the principle. If such an exact formula 
were definitely discovered, we should still be un- 
able to say from mere psychological reasoning 
what similarity value is legally permissible. If 
289 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
  THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
the rules against infringement are interpreted in 
a very rigorous spirit, it may seem desirable to 
prohibit imitations which are as little similar as 
those postal cards which were graded as 40 per 
cent in our similarity scale, and if the interpreta- 
tion is a loose one, it may appear permissible 
to have imitations on the market which are as 
strongly similar as our postal cards graded at 80 
per cent in our similarity scale. Allthis would have 
to be left to the lawmakers and to the judges. 
But what we would have gained is this. We could 
say: if our object exposed for 5 seconds in a group 
of 6 other objects is replaced after an interval of 
20 seconds by an imitation and this change is 
recognized by 8 persons among 10, the degree of 
similarity is 30 per cent and if it is recognized 
by 3 out of 10 subjects, the degree of similarity 
is 90 per cent. In short, from any percentage 
of subjects who under these conditions discovered 
the substitution, we could determine the degree 
of similarity, independent of any individual arbi- 
trariness. If such methods were accepted by the 
trade and the courts, it would only be necessary 
to agree on the percentage of similarity which 
ought to be permitted, and all uncertainty would 
disappear. There would be no wrangling of op- 
posing interests; it would be possible to find out 
whether the permitted limit were overstepped or 
290
-P-A-G-E-303
  ILLEGAL IMITATION 
not with an exactitude similar to that with which 
the weight or the chemical constitution of a trade 
commodity is examined. Certainly the experi- 
ment establishes here conditions which are very 
different from those of practical life. The cus- 
tomer who wants to buy a particular picture postal 
card which he saw once before and to whom the 
salesman offers a similar one, suggesting that it is 
the same, is facing only one card and not a group 
of six. But in practical life the card which he has 
seen was not observed with the definite intention 
of keeping the memory picture in mind, and 
months may have passed since it was seen. The 
memory “picture which the customer has in his 
consciousness when he seeks the particular card 
is much weakened by this circumstance too. We 
secure this weakening artificially by the arrange- 
ment of the experiment in placing the card in a 
group of six or ten and exposing them for a few 
seconds only. The force of attention and the cor- 
responding memory-value are by this distribu- 
tion diminished in a definite degree in the case of 
every single card. 
The investigation must include a careful study 
of the size of the groups, of the time-relations, of 
the percentage of correct answers, all under the 
point of view of greatest fitness for practical appli- 
cation. In the Harvard laboratory the research 
291

  THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
has been carried on partly with such picture 
material, partly with word material, and partly 
with concrete objects.54 Whatever the details of 
the outcome may be, we hope that the work will 
lead to results which may, indeed, make such a 
psychotechnical use possible. Its principles and 
formule might easily be adjusted to any market- 
able material. As a matter of course, if in future 
the courts were ever to accept such psychological, 
experimental methods, it would be intolerable 
dilettantism if such experiments were carried on 
by lawyers and district attorneys. It is as true 
of this economic legal question as of many other 
legal psychological problems that its introduction 
into the courtroom can become desirable only 
when psychological experts are engaged and 
called in the same way as chemical or medical ex- 
perts are invited to the court. On the other hand, 
there is surely not the slightest desire on the part 
of psychologists to be dragged into humiliating 
performances like those which not only hand- 
writing experts, but even psychiatric specialists 
have had to undergo repeatedly in sensational 
court trials. The day for the expert activity in the 
courtroom will come for the psychologist only 
when the country has attached the expert to the 
court and has eliminated the expert retained by 
the plaintiff or the defendant. But this general

practical question as to the position of the psycho- 
logist in the courtroom and as to the need of a 
psychological laboratory in connection with the 
courts would lead us too far aside.

HE effects which we have studied so far were 
produced by inanimate objects, posters or 
displays, advertisements or labels and packings. 
The economic psychotechnics of the future will 
surely study with similar methods the effects of 
the living commercial agencies. Experiments will 
trace the exact effects which the salesman or cus- 
tomer may produce. But here not even a modest 
beginning can be discovered, and it would be diffi- 
cult to mention a single example of experimental 
research. The desired psychological influences of 
the salesman are not quite dissimilar to those of 
the printed means of propaganda. Here, too, it is 
essential to turn the attention of the customer 
to different points, to awaken a vivid favorable 
impression, to emphasize the advantages of the 
goods, to throw full light on them, and finally to 
influence the will-decision either by convincing 
arguments or by persuasion and suggestion. In 
either case the point is to enhance the impulse to 
buy and to suppress the opposing ideas. Yet 
every one of these factors, when it starts from a 
man and not from a thing or paper, changes its 
294
-P-A-G-E-307
    BUYING AND SELLING 
form. The influence becomes narrower, it is di- 
rected toward a smaller number of persons; but, 
on the other hand, it gains just by the new possi- 
bility of individualization. The salesman in the 
store or the commercial traveler adjusts himself 
to the wishes, reactions, and replies of the buyer. 
Above all, when it becomes necessary to direct 
the attention to the decisive points, the personal 
agent has the possibility of developing the whole 
process through a series of stages so that the at- 
tention slowly becomes focused on one definite 
point. The salesman observes at first only the 
general limits of the interest of the customer as 
far as it is indicated by his reactions, but slowly 
he can find out in this whole field the region of 
strongest desires. As soon as he has discovered 
this narrower region in which the prospects of 
success seem to be greatest, he can systematically 
eliminate everything which distracts and scatters 
the attention. He can discover whether the psyche 
of the individual with whom he is dealing can be 
* influenced more strongly by logical arguments or 
by suggestion, and how far he may calculate on 
the pleasure instincts, on the excitement of emo- 
tions, on the impulse to imitate, on the natural 
vanity, on the desire for saving, and on the long- 
ing for luxury. In every one of these directions the 
whole play of human suggestion may be helpful. 
295

   THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
The voice may win or destroy confidence, the 
statement may by its firmness overcome counter- 
motives or by its uncertainty reinforcethem. Even 
hand or arm movements by their motor sugges- 
tion may focus the desires of the customers, while 
unskillful, erratic movements may scatter the 
attention and lead to an inner oscillation of the 
will to buy. 
At every one of these points the psychological 
experiment may find a foothold, and only through 
such methodological study can the haphazard 
proceedings of the commercial world be trans- 
formed into really economic schemes. Indeed, it 
seems nothing but chance that just this field is 
controlled by chance alone. The enormous social 
interplay of energies which are discharged in the 
selling and buying of the millions becomes utterly 
planless as soon as salesman and customer come 
into contact, and this tremendous waste of en- 
ergy cannot appear desirable for any possible 
interest of civilization. The time alone which is 
wasted by useless psychophysical operations in 
front of and behind the counter represents a 
gigantic part of the national budget. Even the 
complaints about the long working day of the 
salesgirls might be eliminated from the debit 
account of the national ledger, if the commercial 
companies could study the psychical processes in 
296 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
  BUYING AND SELLING 
selling and buying with the same carefulness with 
which they analyze all details in preparing the 
stock and fixing the prices. In the army or in the 
fire department, in the railroad service, and even 
in the factory, all necessary activities are so ar- 
ranged that as far as possible the greatest achieve- 
ment is secured by the smallest amount of energy. 
But when the hundreds of millions of customers 
in the civilized world want to satisfy their econo- 
mie demands in the stores, the whole dissolves 
into a flood of talk, because no one has taken the 
trouble to examine scientifically the psychotech- 
nics of selling and to put it ona firm psychological 
foundation. 
The idea of scientific management must be 
extended from the industrial concerns to the 
commercial establishments. The questioning and 
answering, the showing and replacing of the goods, 
the demonstrating and suggesting by the sales- 
men, must be brought into an economic system 
which saves time and energy, as has been tried 
with the laborer in the factory. Wherever eco- 
nomic processes are carried out with superfluous, 
haphazard movements, the national resources 
have to suffer a loss. The single individual can 
never find the ideal form of motion and the ideal 
process by mere instinct. A systematic investiga- 
tion is needed to determine the way to the great- 
297
-P-A-G-E-310
  THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
est saving of energy, and the result ought to be 
made a binding rule for every apprentice. How 
the smallest influences grow by summation may 
be illustrated by the experience of a large depart- 
ment store, in which the expense for delivery of 
the articles sold was felt as too large an item in 
the budget. The hundreds of saleswomen there- 
fore received the order after every sale of mod- 
erate-sized articles not to ask, as before, “May 
we send it to you?” but instead, ‘Will you take 
it with you?” Probably none of the many thou- 
sand daily customers observed the difference, the 
more as it was indifferent to most of them whether 
they took the little package home themselves or 
not. In cases in which it was inconvenient, they 
would anyhow oppose the suggestion and insist 
that the purchasebe sent tothem. Yet it is claimed 
that this hardly noticeable suggestion led to a 
considerable saving in the following year, dis- 
tinctly felt in the budget of the whole establish- 
ment. 
We must not forget, however, that the process 
of buying deserves the same psychological inter- 
est as that of selling. If psychotechnics is to be 
put into the service of a valuable economic task, 
the goal cannot possibly be to devise schemes by 
which the customer may easily be trapped. The 
purpose of science cannot be to help any one to 
298
-P-A-G-E-311
  BUYING AND SELLING 
sell articles to a man who does not need them and 
who would regret the purchase after quiet thought. 
The applied psychologist should help the prospect- 
ive buyer no less, and must protect him so that 
his true intention may become realized in the 
economic process. Otherwise through his sug- 
gestibility, the determining idea of his goal might 
fade in his consciousness and the appeal to his 
vanity or to his instincts might awaken an anti- 
economic desire which he would be too weak to 
inhibit. The salesman must know how to use 
arguments and suggestions and how to make 
them effective,*> but the customer too must 
know how to see through a misleading argument 
and how to resist mere suggestion. 
The postulate that the psychical factors in 
commercial life are to be carefully regarded is 
repeated in more complex form in the wholesale 
business and in the stock exchange. Kt is a per- 
fectly justified and consistent thought which re- 
cently led a large credit bureau to an effort to base 
its information on psychological analysis. It is 
well known that there are bureaus in which the 
ledger experiences of a large circle of companies 
in the same commercial line are collected, tabu- 
lated, and recorded, thus affording an automatic 
review of the occurrences, focusing early attention 
on doubtful accounts and pointing out weaknesses 
299 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
  THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
in the customers’ conditions, as they develop, as 
well as evidences of prosperity. The ledger experi- 
ence which a single company has with all its cus- 
tomers is tabulated without revealing its identity 
to the associates, who get reports containing it, 
and the many combined ledgers become a valu- 
able guide. Yet all such methods can show only 
actual movements in the market, and cannot al- 
low the prospects of future development to be de- 
termined, simply because they cannot take into 
account the personal equations. Only an acquaint- 
ance with the character and the temperament, 
the intelligence and the habits, the energy and 
the weakness, of the head of a firm can tell us 
whether the company, even with satisfactory 
resources, may go down, or whether, even though 
embarrassed, it may hold out. The psychological 
pioneer, therefore, aims not only toward an ex- 
change of ledger accounts, but toward a real psy- 
chological diagnosis and prognosis. If a member 
of a firm is personally known to some scores of 
business men who have had commercial dealings 
with him, and each one of them, without disclos- 
ing his identity to any one but the central bureau, 
sends to it a statement of personal impressions, a 
composite picture of the mental physiognomy

often done in the terms of popular psychology

and in a haphazard, amateurish way. The new 
plan is to arrange the questions systematically 
under the point of view of scientific descriptive 
psychology. Regular psychograms, in which the 
probability of a particular kind of behavior is to 
be determined in an exact percentage calculation, 
are to replace the traditional vagueness, as soon 
as a sufficient number of reliable answers have 
been tabulated. 
Commercial life as a whole finds its contact with 
psychology, of course, not only in the problem of 
how to secure the best mental effect. Those other 
questions which we have discussed essentially 
with reference to factory life and industrial con- 
cerns, namely, how the best man and the best 
work are to be secured, recur in the circle of com- 
mercial endeavors. It seems, indeed, most desir- 
able to devise psychological tests by which the 
ability to be a successful salesman or saleswoman 
may be determined at an early stage. The la- 
mentable shifting of the employees in all com- 
mercial spheres, with its injurious social conse- 
quences, would then be unnecessary, and both 
employers and employees would profit.More- 
over, like the selection of the men, the means of 
securing the most satisfactory work from them, 
has also so far been left entirely to common sense. 
Commercial work stands under an abundance

of varying conditions, and each may have in- 
fluences the isolated effects of which are not 
known, because they have not been studied in that 
systematic form which only the experiment can 
establish. The popular literature on this whole 
group of subjects is extensive, and in its expan- 
sion corresponds to the widespread demand for 
- real information and advice to the salesman. 
But hardly any part of the literature in the bor- 
derland regions of economics is so disappointing 
in its vagueness, emptiness, and helplessness. 
Experimental psychology has nothing with which 
to replace it to-day, but it can at least show the 
direction from which decisive help may be ex- 
pected in future.

THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMIC 
PSYCHOLOGY 
ERE we may stop. From those element- 
ary questions concerning the mental ef- 
fects, the path would quickly lead to questions 
of gravest importance. What is the mental ef- 
fect which the economic labor produces in the 
laborer himself? How do economic movements 
influence the mind of the community? How far 
do non-economic factors produce effects on the 
psychical mechanism of the economic agents? 
But it would be idle to claim to-day for exact 
psychology, with its methods of causal thought, 
regions in which so far popular psychology, with 
its methods of purposive thought, is still sovereign. 
Our aim certainly was not to review the totality 
of possible problems related to economic efficiency, 
but merely to demonstrate the principles and the 
methods of experimental economic psychology 
by a few characteristic illustrations. As all the 
examples which we selected were chosen only in 
order to make clear the characteristic point of 
view of psychotechnics, it is unimportant whether 
the particular results will stand the test of further 
303
-P-A-G-E-316
  THE BEST POSSIBLE EFFECT 
experimental investigations, or will have to be 
modified by new researches. What is needed to- 
day is not to distribute the results so far reached 
as if they were parts of a definite knowledge, but 
only to emphasize that the little which has been 
accomplished should encourage continuous effort. 
To stimulate such further work is the only pur- 
pose of this sketch. 
This further work will have to be a work of co- 
operation. The nature of this problem demands 
a relatively large number of persons for the ex- 
perimental treatment. With most experimental 
researches in our psychological laboratories, the 
number of the subjects experimented on is not 
so important as the number of experiments made 
with a few well-trained participants. But with 
the questions of applied psychology the number of 
persons plays a much more significant réle, as the 
individual differences become of greatest import- 
ance. The same problems ought therefore to be 
studied in various places, so that the results 
may beexchanged and compared. Moreover, these 
psychological economic investigations naturally 
lead beyond the possibilities of the university 
laboratories. To a certain degree this was true 
of other parts of applied psychology as well. Edu- 
cational and medical experimental psychology 
could not reach their fullest productivity until 
304
-P-A-G-E-317
FUTURE OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY 
the experiment was systematically carried into 
the schoolroom and the psychiatric clinic. But 
the classroom and the hospital are relatively ac- 
cessible places for the scientific worker, as both 
are anyhow conducted under a scientific point of 
view. The teacher and the physician can easily 
learn to perform valuable experiments with 
school children or with patients. This favorable 
condition is lacking in the workshop and the fac- 
tory, in the banks and the markets. The acade- 
mic psychologist will be able to undertake work 
there only with a very disturbing expenditure of 
time and only under exceptional conditions. If 
such experiments, for instance, with laborers in 
a factory or employees of a railway are to ad- 
vance beyond the faint first efforts of to-day and 
are really to become serviceable to the cultural 
progress of our time with effective completeness, 
they ought not to remain an accidental appendix 
to the theoretical laboratories. Either the uni- 
versities must create special laboratories for 
applied psychology or independent research in- 
stitutes must be founded which attack the new 
concrete problems under the point of view of 
national political economy. Experimental work- 
shops could be created which are really adjusted 
to the special practical needs and to which a 
sufficiently large number of persons could be 
305

drawn for the systematic researches. The ideal 
solution for the United States would be a gov- 
ernmental bureau for applied psychology, with 
special reference to the psychology of commerce 
and industry, similar to the model agricultural 
stations all over the land under the Department 
of Agriculture. 
Only when such a broad foundation has been 
secured will the time be ripe to carry the method 
systematically into the daily work. The aim 
will never be for real experimental researches to 
be performed by the foreman in the workshop or 
by the superintendent in the factory. But slowly 
a certain acknowledged system of rules and pre- 
scriptions may be worked out which may be 
used as patterns, and which will not presuppose 
any scientific knowledge, any more than an under- 
standing of the principles of electricity is neces- 
sary for one who uses the telephone. But besides 
the rigid rules which any one may apply, par- 
ticular prescriptions will be needed fitting the 
special situation. This leads to the demand for 
the large establishments to appoint profession- 
ally trained psychologists who will devote their 
services to the psychological problems of the 
special industrial plant. There are many fac- 
tories that have scores of scientifically trained 
chemists or physicists at work, but who would

FUTURE OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY 
consider it an unproductive luxury to appoint 
a scientifically schooled experimental psychologist 
to their staff. And yet his observations and re- 
searches might become economically the most 
important factor. Similar expectations might be 
justified for the large department stores and es- 
pecially for the big transportation companies. In 
smaller dimensions the same real needs exist in 
the ordinary workshop and store. It is obvious 
that the professional consulting psychologist 
would satisfy these needs most directly, and if 
such a new group of engineers were to enter into 
industrial life, very soon a further specialization 
might be expected. Some of these psychological 
engineers would devote themselves to the pro- 
blems of vocational selection and appointment; 
others would specialize on questions of advertise- 
ment and display and propaganda; a third group 
on problems of fatigue, efficiency, and recrea- 
tion; a fourth on the psychological demands for 
the arrangement of the machines; and every day 
would give rise to new divisions. Such a well- 
schooled specialist, if he spent a few hours in a 
workshop or a few days in a factory, could submit 
propositions which might refer exclusively to the 
psychological factors and yet which might be 
more important for the earning and the profit of 
the establishment than the mere buying of new 
807

machines or the mere increase in the number of 
laborers. 
No one can deny that such a transition must 
be burdened with difficult complications and even 
with dangers; and still less will any one doubt that 
it may be caricatured. One who demands that 
a chauffeur or a motorman of an electric railway 
be examined as to his psychical abilities by sys- 
tematic psychological methods, so that accidents 
may be avoided, does not necessarily demand that 
a congressman or a cabinet minister or a candi- 
date for marriage be tested too by psychological 
laboratory experiments, as the witty ones have 
proposed. And one who believes that the work 
in the factory ought to be studied with reference 
to the smallest possible expenditure of psychical 
impulses is not convinced that the same experi- 
mental methods will be necessary for the func- 
tions of eating and drinking and love-making, as 
has been suggested. 
And if it is true that difficulties and discomforts 
are to be feared during the transition period, they 
should be more than outweighed by the splendid 
betterments to be hoped for. We must not forget 
that the increase of industrial efficiency by future 
psychological adaptation and by improvement 
of the psychophysical conditions is not only in 
the interest of the employers, but still more of the

employees; their working time can be reduced, 
their wages increased, their level of life raised. 
And above all, still more important than the 
naked commercial profit on both sides, is the cul- 
tural gain which will come to the total economic 
life of the nation, as soon as every one can be 
brought to the place where his best energies may 
be unfolded and his greatest personal satisfac- 
tion secured. The economic experimental psy- 
chology offers no more inspiring idea than this 
adjustment of work and psyche by which mental 
dissatisfaction in the work, mental depression 
and discouragement, may be replaced in our 
social community by overflowing joy and perfect 
inner harmony.

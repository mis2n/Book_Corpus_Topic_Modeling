INTRODUCTION. 
— 
Dr. Paut Rapestock, the author of this work, already favor- 
ably known by several other psychological monographs, has, 
in scarcely less degree than Ribot in France or Sully in Eng- 
land, the happy faculty of absorbing the literature of a large 
scientific field and re-stating it in lucid, untechnical, and con- 
densed form. He has read widely in anthropology and morbid 
and experimental psychology, and in this work, which is here 
translated entire, he has rendered his chief service to educa- 
tion. . 
He assumes that, so far as education becomes a science, or 
teaching a profession, it will rest more entirely upon psy- 
chology. Education he regards as progressive habituation, 
and good habits as even more important than good principles. 
What makes the novice a master is the power of the brain to lay 
up earlier stimuli in the form of dispositions. Habit not only 
lays down the trunk lines of association, and thus gives direction, 
but it furnishes momentum of mind and will. We have truly 
learned, not what we can be examined on, but what has become 
second nature or habit. Memory must lapse to custom, and 
sometimes to fixed reflex action or “ will-memory,” before the 
assimilation of instruction is complete. The stages in this 
process, from the residual trace left by the first act, which is the

germ or point of departure for habitude, the excitation by 
“organic phosphorescence” or memory of all that favors, and 
the suppression of all colliding or diverting acts or impressions, 
the fusing of similars widely scattered in time and space in the 
sharpest possible focus of attention, till the raw material of 
memory is summated and gradually digested into faculty, and 
atoned in instinct and intuition, — this is the story of these 
pages. If we assume with Aristotle that the process of habitu- 
ation may be extremely accelerated by right methods, or re- 
tarded by wrong ones, or with this author that more men are 
made not only bad but ignorant by education or habit than by 
nature, the practical bearings of a work like this will not be 
underestimated. 
Habit steadies and gives strength. Harmonious ideas are 
reénforced and discordant ones fade out. Character is slowly 
defined ; tact and taste take the place of memory and labored 
consciousness, as we turn over to our automaton what express 
volition had to do before. This residuum and deposit of schools 
and books, and even of experience, is the measure and standard 
of all educational values, and is even physically transmissible 
to succeeding generations. 
Radestock does not overlook the fact that extreme habitua- 
tion is fraught with dangers. It may diminish the many-sided- 
ness of our interests, and even make the new incomprehensible 
   
       or intolerable to us. It may so conventionalize us as to weaken 
the will and enervate the feelings. This is the danger Rousseau . 
feared in urging that a child must be accustomed to nothing, | 
not even to the predominant use of the right hand, or to: 
eating and sleeping at the same place or time, etc., lest the

sphere of liberty should be interfered with. A sudden change 
of environment and habits has often proved a great stimulus to 
consciousness, and genius often manifests what I have elsewhere 
designated as zomophobia, or hatred of the usual, or a passion 
for the unwonted. This is no doubt often favorable to the rapid 
new combinations of thought that characterize genius. It is, 
however, exceptional and no doubt often morbid, and, as our 
author well observes, even genius must be habituated by educa- 
tion, and needs teachers who are not geniuses. 
Dr. Radestock is well read in the newer English psychologi- 
cal literature, and this makes his thought still more lucid to us. 
The translator and the publisher of this little book merit the 
thanks of those American teachers who are interested in the 
psychological basis of their vocation, :

CHAPTER I. 
VALUE AND LIMITS OF_EDUCATION. 
FORCE AND VALUE OF HABIT.~—- VARIOUS DEFINITIONS OF 
HABIT. 
‘HE greatest variety of opinions has been advanced, with 
regard to the value and limits of education. Some claim 
that it can do everything, while others believe that it can do 
nothing, and that the difference in the mental capacity of men 
rests only on the endowments conferred upon them by nature. 
_ The true mean between these two extremes is perhaps best 
- expressed in Lessing’s “ Education of Mankind” ; “ Education 
gives man nothing which he could not have developed from 
within himself. It gives him that which he might have devel- 
oped from within himself more quickly and easily.” 
“Education can only develop and form, not create. It can- 
not undertake to form a being into anything other than it was 
destined to be by the endowments it originally received at the 
hand of nature.” 
“Education can only develop and unfold; it cannot create 
anything new.” — X. Rosenkranz,
-P-A-G-E-10
2 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
Henry Maudsley writes: “It is self-evident that education is 
restricted within certain limits ; caused on the one hand by the 
species, on the other by individual organization. But man can 
only, in the former case, determine what is predetermined in the 
organization of the nervous system and of the bodily machinery 
in connection with it; can only in the latter case make actual 
the potentialities of the individual nature, and not every youth- 
ful citizen can be trained to become a Socrates or Shakespeare.” 
Of false education, it is true, we can still say what Resewitz 
remarked a century since, “More people are spoilt by a false 
education than ever inherited their corruption as a sad endow- 
ment from na’ 
With regard to the different degrees of ability to be taught 
and educated, evinced by various pupils, Amos Comenius says, 
in substance: “Some pupils are sharp, others dull; some soft 
and yielding, others hard and obstinate; some are naturally 
studious, while others take more pleasure in manual labor; 
whence we may speak of six different dispositions. 1. There 
are children who are ingenious, anxious to learn, tractable, and 
therefore suited above all for students; these require only an 
offer of food for wisdom ; they grow like rare plants. Care, in 
fact, is needed to prevent any over-exertion on their part, which 
is but too often followed by weariness and disgust. 2. Others 
are penetrating and slow, but withal tractable ; these need only 
to be spurred on. 3. There are children who are penetrating 
and studious, but stubborn and obstinate ; they are generally 
hated in schools, and one is inclined to give them up ; yet these 
generally grow to be the greatest men if they are correctly 
trained. 4. There are obedient and studious children who are, 
however, slow and difficult of comprehension. These must; 
follow in the tracks of the former; and that this may be possi- 
ble, we must stoop to their level, we must not place too heavy) 
burdens upon them, nor judge them harshly, but must bear with’ 
them willingly, raise them, encourage them, cheer them, that 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
VALUE AND LIMITS OF EDUCATION. 3 
they may take heart. They may reach the goal later, but will 
endure longer, as late fruits generally do. 5. Some are dull, 
troublesome, and lazy. These can also be improved, but there 
must be no obstinacy, and much skill and patience are required. 
6. There are dull ones who are by nature ill-willed, wrong- 
headed, and generally spoiled, Even here we should not lose 
hope at first. If it is, however, impossible to improve them, 
they should be left alone.” 
Flattich thinks that the human mind differs in quality, like the 
soil found in farming. 1. There is soil good on the surface and 
bad below ; 2. that bad on the surface and good below; 3. that 
good both on the surface and below; 4. that bad both on the 
surface and deep down in the ground. Minds like the first kind 
of soil learn well at first and then badly ; these are fitted for a 
knowledge of languages, history, and geography ; those of the 
second kind are suited for deep and heavy thinking, because 
they learn badly at first, and improve after awhile; those of 
the third class are fit for anything; those of the fourth, for 
nothing. 
K. Von Raumer says: “Some pupils were intelligent, quick, 
and vigorous of comprehension, decisive and confident in an- 
swering ; others were more deliberate, musing, and reflective, 
comprehending more slowly and answering with some hesitation. 
| Some had a comparatively equal liking for all studies, while 
others had a distinct predilection for certain subjects.” 
Education cannot create anything new; it can only develop 
and unfold the already existing faculties of the human mind; - 
but in this developing and unfolding lies its greatest value. 
To those who think little of it—perhaps because egotism leads 
them to ascribe to their own powers what is really the result of 
the good influence of others, while they make education and 
the effect of evil circumstances responsible for all their evil 
traits — experience will plainly show what great difference there 
is between a man who, endowed by nature with happy facultiea,

has also enjoyed the benefit of a good education, and one who, 
through want of sufficient education, has not been able to de- 
velop his faculties and employ them for the welfare of mankind, 
It is true that now and then an eminent talent will succeed, by 
ceaseless energy in conquering all obstacles, and will gain by its 
own strength the height to which others did not assist it in 
mounting ; but then it only reaches the goal with far greater 
struggles and after much longer time than if its aspirations had 
been aided from earliest youth by a careful education. For this 
it is that awakens the slumbering powers, incites them to a more 
rapid development, and finally brings them to full fruition. fa 
gives man “what he could develop from within himself more 
quickly and more easily.” 
This great end, however, is best reached by the aid of one of 
Education’s trusty servants, —the formation of habit, which 
changes functions, of whatever Kind, originally perfotried but 
slowly and with effort, into rapid and skilful actions, performed 
with dexterity and ease ; it makes study easier, and finally builds 
the bridge uniting theory with practice by changing dead knowl- 
edge into a living power. Mankind is well aware of the power 
of practice and habit, as is shown by numerous proverbs, In 
literature, finally, we shall find the importance of the formation 
of habits insisted upon, not alone by ancient and modem peda 
gogues, but by most other learned men and sages. 
I. Locke says: “As the years advance, they bring greatel 
freedom from restraint, and the boy must often be left to his 
own guidance, because no mentor can be ever at his side exe 
the one created in his own mind by sound principles and steady 
habits. It is true this is the best and safest one, and therefo 
worthy of the highest consideration ; for we must expect noth’ 
ing from precautionary maxims and good precepts, though the! 
be deeply impressed on the mind, beyond the point at whi 
practice has changed them to firm habits.” Children are not 
be taught by maxims, which continually slip from their mem
-P-A-G-E-13
VALUE AND LIMITS OF EDUCATION. 5 
Whatever we believe they must imperatively do, we .should 
strengthen them in doing by unwearied practice, whenever the 
opportunity offers, and, if possible, create opportunities there- 
for. 
Rousseau opposes in his “Emile” the saying, “Nature is 
nothing but the formation of habits.” There are many habits 
which are contrary to nature ; these, however, can exist only so 
long as the controlling force lasts; this ceasing, they vanish 
before nature breaking forth with renewed -power (naturam 
expellas furca tamen usque recurret); yet he finally arrives at 
the conclusion, “Education is certainly nothing but a forma- 
tion of habits.” : 
Even before rules and maxims are recognized, and afterwards 
simultaneously with these the mind of the child can be tumed 
by force of habit in the direction which its character will after- 
wards assume. . . 
He who early teaches children to bear what they will have to 
undergo in afterlife, who lets those rules, which are in future 
to guide their actions, guide them now, and who finally has them 
repeat these so often and so long that they no longer err, has 
accomplished not a little. 
Niemeyer thinks that: “The familiarizing of young people, 
even from their earliest years, with habits of order, cleanliness 
decency, and politeness, will not be without lasting Giecron 
their inner life. Children take their first steps towards civiliza~ 
tion in these matters, (he love for regularity is thus formed. 
Evil habits are forgotten by disus@y The more rarely evil traits 
havé an opportunity of appearing, the more the causes are re- 
moved by which they are excited, the. more they will lose in 
Strength, as physical powers relax when not exercised.” 
“A child is accustomed to an action by giving it the oppor- 
tunity to practise this one especially, and by removing any op- 
Portunities for other actions colliding with it ; thirdly, by height- 
€ning the pleasure in the action by a union of pleasant impres-

sions with the deed, and on the other hand, making the conflict. 
ing habits unpleasant by uniting them with pain. Habit almos 
invariably goes farther than precept, and the teacher must as: 
cribe most of his successes to the formation of habits. For the 
power of insight generally covers a_single case only, while thai 
of habit reaches through a whole ie) — J. G. Curiman, 
Among those habits which the spirit of the present time ren- 
ders more difficult of acquisition are those of temperance, plain 
ness, modesty, and unselfishness, Others are made easier bj 
custom, as habits of cleanliness, decency, etc. Curtman par: 
ticularly marks: 1. The formation of habits of order. Th 
acquisition of regular habits in the use of time is of almo 
greater importance than a regularity with regard to place ; abo 
all else in importance is the restriction of sleep to a certai 
quantity of time. 2, Habits of attention. 3. Habits of obedi 
ence.. 4. Breaking up of evil habits. 
Deinhardt says of the various methods by which habits 
acquired: “ (a) From its earliest infancy, the child must 
habituated to ways of cleanliness and order. (4) As soon 
the will begins to form, the habit of obedience must be incul 
cated, (¢) The correct use of the mother-tongue must 
practised until it becomes a habit. In school the habits of at 
tention and industry should be taught, while scientific educati 
leads to habits of thinking and speaking.” “Clearness and di 
tinctness, perspicuity and precision, regularity and consistency 
in all mental operations are necessary habits in sound thi

favorite habit which rules his inmost sensibilities and aspirations 
so that no power from without can turn him away from it, is 
honest indeed. : : 
(Greater strength and ease in the combination and associa- 
tion of ideas, like dexterity and skill in the movement of the 
muscles, is most easily and surely acquired by repetition, The 
more manifold and varied these repetitions are, instead of con- 
tinually going over the same beaten track, the more unre- 
stricted and unconstrained will be the acquired skill ; for which 
Teason we cannot enough recommend repetition of what has 
gone before, from a different point of view, and under other 
conditions, especially in all mental studies.” — Dr. Eisenlohr. 
Theo, Fechner in his “School of Aésthetics” points to the 
psychological value of habits and practice: What was objected 
to at first will often after several repetitions of the impression 
be endured, yea, received with decided pleasure, and. its loss 
be sadly felt. This is a sort of adaptation of our inner organ- 
ism to an attraction which is gradually called forth by the effect 
of the attraction itself. By practice many a one will lose his 
predilection for what is coarse, and in its stead train a feeling 
of refinement. 
Dr. Kussmaul, in his “ Corruption of Languages,” speaks of 
the value of the formation of habits as regards language. Com- 
Parative philology offers many instances of the importance of 
Practice and habit. ‘There are entire nations or separate parts 
of one nation to whom the pronunciation of 7 or 4 4 or ch, the 
dental #4, the diphthongs or any other letter causes great diffi- 
culty, although they have not lost the organs used in articulat- 
ing them, The association of conceptions with ideas, and their 
union with feelings and aspirations, is as much under the con- 
trol of education and habit as the co-ordination of the articu- * 
latory central stations.” Most human actions are acquired by 
Practice. “The aim of all human education is the control of 
all inborn and. acquired reflections by rational and sensible 
motives,”

   We also find many proverbs about the force and value of 
habit. In “Practiced in youth, accomplished in age,” there is| 
a distinct incentive to the early formation of habits. “ Every 
drop hollows the stone” and “ Practice makes perfect,” proclaim 
that repeated attempts will conquer all obstacles and finally 
lead to the goal. “ By habit many things grow to be part of our- 
selves (in succum et sanguinum) ‘and become second naturel 
The power of good as well as evil habits is shown in “A hool 
will early begin to bend,” while for unnatural and forced habits 
the old word still holds good, “Naturam expellas furca tamen| 
usque recurret.” = 
Let us look for a moment at the definitions of the word “ habit" 
given by some pedagogues, and differing only in the degree of| 
their inadequacy. Curtman says: € The formation of habit 
is the change of an outer or inner action into a propensity} 
The organic powers grow through practice. Their actions in 
this way become easier, skill is formed and habit also, in so far 
as an inclination to repeat the action frequently is connected, 
therewith, The action by the performance of which a habit i 
created is called habituation.” Now it is true, that every labor| 
which is not too great is accompanied by a pleasant feeling 
and the accumulation of like feelings in succeeding, which fol- 
low the practice of the same occupation, may cause a propem 
sity for that occupation; but, as Campe remarks, the ide: 
“ propensity ” and skill should be carefully kept apart althougl 
they are often mistaken for each other ; as there is often gr 
skill without any perceptible propensity, and strong propensi 
without any noticeable skill, “The galley slave has skill i 
rowing, but hardly the slightest propensity for this tiresome 
labor, and the young student of the piano often has an inclina 
tion to play although he may not have gained any skill therein.’ 
In the latter case it is true, continued practice will increase 
inclination and interest, but not so much where enforced habits 
oppose natural talents. Even here much is often gladly di

that was formerly undertaken only with disgust, for one must 
truly “ grow warm” over some work, and enjoy the pleasure it 
affords, to overcome the original aversion, This is, however, 
not always the case; on the contrary, the original aversion is 
often heightened, especially when the consciousness of com- 
pulsion, the feeling of aversion connected with that conscious- 
ness, and the contrasted conception of actual individual talent, 
unite to keep down the sense of pleasure which usually ac- 
companies all work, and to create repugnance and disgust. 
Rochester writes: “The pleasure man takes in labor is espe- 
cially dependent on the extent and the security in which he 
hopes himself to enjoy the fruits of his industry, for which 
reason the slave and the gavelman work with the greatest 
antipathy.” 
Propensity is not a general and necessary result of habit ; it 
Cannot therefore be used in the above way as a definition. 
Deinhardt defines habit as follows: f Habit, they say, is the 
Second nature, and herein the idea of habit is so clearly and 
Precisely expressed that the greatest philosopher could not 
express it better. He means by nature in general, a being 
founded in itself, the appearance and actions of which neces- 
sarily proceed from its inherent laws. The second nature is 
to him, however, the. mental that is, the intellectual and moral 
lite, which every man is called upon to form and develop from 
Within himself in the short space of mortal life apportioned to 
him” The proverb, however, says, Habit decomes second 
hature, that is, it lets many functions become second nature. 
If, as Deinhardt thinks, “ Every form which the mental being of 
man takes upon itself in the process of growth is a true one, 
Corresponding to the nature of man, only when it has the same 
Precision, firmness, and infallibility as the form of ‘a mere 
Ratural organism,” habit, it is true, can aid the intellectual and 
Moral life in acquiring this firmness ; if carried to an extreme, 
et, it will only harm, as we shall see hereafter, the

self-consciousness and spontaneity which, according to Dein 
hardt, are the essential characteristics of this “ second nature’ 
Habit itself is not this second nature, as it is found not on} 
in mankind, but also in beings of a lower order, where th 
can be no question of self-consciousness and self-determinatio 
so that these ideas should not at all enter into the definition. 
The same may be answered when Rosenkranz defines hab 
as “the identity of consciousness with the particularity of 
action or suffering.” Dumont refutes the opinion of sev 
authors, especially physiologists, who look upon habits 
“unconscious and involuntary actions in contrast to conscit 
and voluntary ones,” as many habitual processes are ¢ 
sciously performed, while others not habitual (somnambuli 
arg Jess conscious and voluntary. , 
urphy explains habit as a tendency of certain actions 
repeat themselves, or, at least by repetition to gain greater 
of action, to which Dumont remarks that the tendency may 
explained by the habit, but not the latter by the former; 
tendency (“la tendance ou le penchant”) is composed 
habit and a surplus of available power.)

OF EXTENDING SENSATIONS. 
Ir we study some of these explanations and definitions more 
closely, we shall recognize that it would be of great value here, 
if we changed Psychology, the basis of Pedagogy, into Physio- 
logical Psychology, which in the well-founded view that every 
mental process is connected with a physical one in the brain 
and nervous systern, keeps this physical process as far as possi- 
ble in view in discussing and investigating the separate psychi- 
cal functions. In doing this, we need not at all embrace the 
materialistic view which looks upon these physical processes as 
“the only things in actual existence,” and upon thought as a 
“secretion of the brain,” for every clear and calm considera- 
tion will recognize the shallowness of such views. 
Cabanis claims that the brain produces the “secretion of 
thoughts,” and his editor justly remarks, “This phrase remains 
celebrated,” for several materialists have again and again 
attempted to establish its’ currency, while L. Biichner in his 
Widely-read “ Kraft und Stoff,” characterizes thought as the 
Powerful action of the machinery of human organs, and com- 
Pares it to the effect caused by the steam-engine. But this 
view is as fallacious as the last, as it contradicts the law of the 
Preservation of forces reigning in material nature. 
Wundt says of materialism: “It does not recognize that 
inner experience has the priority of all outer knowledge, that
-P-A-G-E-20
12 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
the objects of the outer world are ideas which were developed 
within us, according to psychological laws, and that, above all, 
the conception of matter is an entirely hypothetical idea upon 
which we base the phenomena of the physical world in order 
to understand their changing forms and play.” 
Neither should we permit ourselves to take a psychical 
action for granted without any physical basis in those few 
provinces which have been so far inaccessible to the somatic 
(physiologic-psychological) methods. Accurate investigation 
has proven that much which was formerly deemed a purely 
psychical peculiarity is based upon certain physical attributes 
and processes, and is made clearer by their investigation. 
(See Note r.) 
Bain says: “There are two widely different natural phe- 
nomena, one, consciousness or mind; the other, matter or 
material order : both are intimately connected. We must study 
the being of each in its own manner to recognize the general 
laws of their union, and to follow them to the explanation of 
separate facts. The mind is destined to be a double study, to 
unite the philosopher with the naturalist.” 
We shall therefore adopt this “somatic” method.here, and 
in investigating the nature and value of the formation of habit, 
and of habit itself, glance first at the physical processes on 
which it depends. 
The external cause of sensorial impressions is the movable 
and vibratile condition of matter which directly or indirectly 
acts on the ends of the sensory nerves, and here causes an 
impression which is carried by the nerves to the brain. (See 
Note 2.) The quality of the impression depends upon the. 
manner of the vibrations, while its intensity is determined by 
their strength. 
Tt is a well-known phenomenon that the irritation of the cell 
membrane surrounding the nerves of our organ of sight com 
tinues after the sensation caused by the actual impression has

passed away (lightning). (See Note 3.) The sensations of 
sound are likewise often continued after the immediate influ- 
ence of the impression is over: the same seems to be the case 
with taste and odor impressions. 
The after-effect of impressions in the spinal cord is stronger 
even than in the peripheral ends of the nerves. 
Besides the special or particular sensory impression of the 
organs of sight, sound, smell, and taste, four kinds of motion 
under the proper circumstances will cause impressions on every 
Sensory organ. 1. Mechanical pressure or shock; 2. electri- . 
City; 3. heat vibrations ; 4. chemical actions. Each of these. 
Processes must have a certain intensity and velocity to become 
Noticeable as a sensation. Among the manifold forms of. 
motion in nature, only a few are capable of acting upon our 
Sensory organs. The impressions of every sense form a regu- 
lar series, and thereby produce the required condition for the 
similarity. of impressions. There are, however, in general no 
regular connecting links between the impressions of the various 
senses, and there remain intermediate forms of vibrations by 
which our sensory organs are not touched. Wand. 
Such forms of vibration as do not touch our senses lie be- 
tween those which impress us as sound and those we feel as 
heat. (See Note 4.) 
Our senses are only impressed by such modes.of motion in 
nature as correspond to arrangements in any one of the sensory 
organs permitting a transmission of motion, a change of the 
Physical into a physiological sensation. ‘The ear will not per- 
felve such sound waves as sound, and the eye such rays as 
light, the vibratory velocity of which exceeds a certain limit or 
descends below a fixed point. 
Now it is well known that there are individuals who in con- 
Sequence of the disposition and development of their sensory 
Srgans possess greater powers of discrimination in these de- 
Parents than others, so that they can perceive tones, colors,
-P-A-G-E-22
4 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
odor, or taste impressions as distinct and separate from each 
other, which others can no longer distinguish. They therefore 
perceive certain vibratory motions as distinct, which others are 
not able to distinguish from those near by. Further, it must 
be acknowledged that there may be organisms in which the 
dispositions belonging to man for taste and smell sensations, 
may have reached an actual development just as there may 
be, on the other hand, organisms existing which lack the 
capability that man has of receiving sound and light impres- 
sions, though they may be able to distinguish a few kinds of 
sound and light. (See Note 5.) 
If, then, we must acknowledge that there are beings which, in 
consequence of the special structure of the sensory organs, not 
only have different sensations from those of man, but also in 
certain divisions of the senses feel more or fewer impressions 
as separate and distinct than he so recognizes, we can take it 
for granted that there are those which feel motions in nature, 
that do not act upon man as sensory impressions at all, But 
then the theory is not absurd that a new, yes, even several 
and many new natural powers may be discovered for the 
perception of which man has no especial sense, but which 
are made known to him in an artistic way and by aid of the 
other senses as soon as they transform themselves into the 
respective modes of motion ; that, furthermore, this new power 
of nature—for which at the same time a new name must be | 
created — forms the, as yet unrecognized, factor in phenomena 
which until now have not been explained at all, or only very 
unsatisfactorily. (See Note 6.) 
After some time, when the sensation and conception corre- 
sponding to the outer impressions have vanished from con- 
sciousness and entered the domain of the unconscious, it would 
appear as though every sign of the physical process had also 
vanished. But there are many evidences that the impression 
did not pass away without leaving some trace, that it left a.

certain disposition in the nervous system which is not like the 
actual molecular motion, accompanying the impression, but 
facilitates its reappearance, It is impossible that the latent 
conception should be the same as the actual one, or even that 
it should consist of a less degree of the same ; at least one sign 
is wanting, — the accompanying physiological irritation. But it 
is also true that the latter is not without its after-effect in a 
purely physiological sense. 
Even in every nerve-fibre the susceptibility is heightened by 
every emotion, in case it is not too strong; that is, a changed 
condition remains by which a repetition of the same sensation 
is rendered easier. In the central nerve substance, these results 
are very similar, but of much longer duration. In all pro- 
cesses dependent upon our nervous system we notice such 
after-effects, as, in their outer appearance, we are in the habit 
of calling practice. These are especially known to us from 
the motion of members of our body.’ 
Numerous thoroughly studied experiences compel us to take 
for granted that analogous processes of practice (like that of 
the muscles) take place everywhere in the nervous system and 
its accessory organs. We must conceive the changes which 
are hereby produced in the organs as molecular deposits of 
More or less duration, which are as different from the motion 
which they render easier as the layers of chlorine and nitro- 
gen atoms in nitro-chloric-acid gas are different from the 
explosive dissolution which is quickened by it. (See Note 7.) 
“Where we have no knowledge of the true condition of the 
molecular changes, in which this practice consists, as is the case 
With the complicated structure of the nervous system, we have 
only the one general expression, which, however, has the advan- 
tage in contrast with the view of remaining material impressions, 
that it claims material after-effects, which continue at first, 
but with no practice gradually fall away, and do not consist 
in a continuation of the function itself, but in facilitating its 
Yepetition.” — Wand.

Some persons, it is true, think that the claim of physiologicat 
dispositions is a pure fiction, brought forward to gain the physi 
ological foundation of which we know nothing, for psychologi- 
cal facts of which alone we have any knowledge. To these, 
Wundt answers that it is just on their physica/ side that we may 
hope gradually to know more of the nature of those enduring 
changes, which we shortly term dispositions; while, on the 
psychical side, we must forever give up this hope, as the limit 
of consciousness is also the boundary of our inner experi- 
ence, 
A great many of these scholars look upon the change which 
remains as a material trace which is similar to the former and 
to-be-repeated act, but of less force ; but Wundt remarks that 
conceptions are not eternal beings, but functions; and that 
the remaining after-effects are to be thought of as functional 
dispositions. He attempts to explain the difference in the 
following way: An eye which has long looked into glaring 
light will retain an impression in the image left on the retina, 
but an eye which often compares great distances in space 
gains an increasing power in sight-measuring. The retained 
image is a remaining trace ; the skill in measuring, a functional 
disposition ; the cell membrane, and muscles of the practised 
eye may possibly be fashioned in just the same way as those of 
the unpractised one; and yet the one has a stronger disposi 
tion than the other. 
Not only the peripheral ends of the sensory nerves retain 
such physiological dispositions, but we have a right to regard 
this power to retain as a general attribute of the whole nervous 
system, especially in the central division of the brain and spinal 
cord. 
Luys says a sensation, during its transmission by the nerves, 
is not equally great everywhere, but grows like an avalanche 
‘the more it approaches the central parts. He calls this 
quality which the nervous system has of retaining impressions
-P-A-G-E-25
PSYCHOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 17 
of former sensations, “organic phosphorescence,” and com- 
pares it with the properties of so-called phosphorescent bodies, 
which, after they have been touched by rays of light, still send 
forth a brilliant glow even after the source of the falling light 
has disappeared. (See Note 8.) 
Others look upon this power of the nervous system as a. 
universal function of all organic matter, of which function 
transmission. is only a special form, 
Hensen thinks: “Memory is not a change of the molecular 
arrangements of central parts, — nerve-cells, — because if it 
were, the rapid production of the substance of our body would 
very soon destroy all such trace-formations.” 
Ribot defines descent in the following way: “Heredity is 
that law of Biology by virtue of which all those beings en- 
dowed with life tend to repeat themselves in their descend- 
ants ; it gives to the species what personal identity is for the 
individual.” 
Charles Darwin and his followers attempted to show that 
actions of animals and of men, engendered by natural or arti- 
ficial training, became fixed as habits, and then, like all enduring 
Physical and psychical qualities, were transmitted to others, 
and thereby became inborn instincts and dispositions which, 
under the continued influence of constant natural laws, grew in 
force and strength. 
Even though we think that decided clear conceptions and 
complete psycho-physical processes are not themselves trans- 
nitted, but only a disposition for them which facilitates their 
Tepetition, yet it admits of no doubt that heredity, one form of 
the described “universal function of matter,” is of immense 
importance because it transmits to the individual the residuum 
of the psycho-physical development of all preceding genera- 
tions as dispositions. 
This disposition remaining in the nervous system from previous 
Sensations is changed again into an actual sensation, by the
-P-A-G-E-26
18 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
return of an impression or conception which preceded or fol- 
lowed the former function; in the reproduced form it appears 
as a renewed function of consciousness, which recognizes it as 
identical with the former in “ memory.” 
Aside from external impressions, and those engendered in 
the sensory organs as well as in the rest of the organism 
(general sensations), other impressions (so-called “ automatic 
sensations”), in which the nerve-centres themselves form the 
point of issue, may cause a function. The best known actions 
which are caused by automatic sensations are involuntary and 
instinctive motions. But without doubt still other processes 
dependent on the nervous system — secretions, interceptions 
of motion, etc. are sometimes occasioned by the same kind of 
sensation. According to this, we give the name “automatic 
sensations” to all those external motions which are caused by 
internal irritation of the motory central division. Luys writes: 
“Especially during sleep, when the sensory organs are more 
unsusceptible to external impressions, the internal sensations 
originating in the blood remain active, and automatic sensa- 
tions, together with the functionary dispositions loosened by 
them, cause the imaginative conceptions of dreams. In patho- 
logic conditions they are the cause of vague ideas and delirium 
as well as forced actions in the motory department.” Wundt 
classifies impressions according to their physical origin, in the 
following manner : ~

irritation. irritation.

v 
This after-effect of impressions, and the continuance of con- 
eeptional functions as functional dispositions, is of the greatest 
importance for all psychical life. Without the existence of 
external sensory organs, no conceptions would be formed ; 
without that fortunate condition of the central organs, which 
renders the recall of former sensory impressions possible, there 
could be no connection between our impressions and concep- 
tions. It is only through this that consciousness gains that 
continuity which distinguishes us from beings of a day by 
tendering it possible in the steady flow of mental processes to 
descend once more into this flow. For this reason we infer a 
Present consciousness in the gradual succession of beings from 
the after-effect of past impressions. This only will show us 
whether that union of impressions, characteristic to all con- 
sciousness, has been preserved to a certain degree. For in 
every case “the ability to connect ideas and conceptions ” 
Serves us as “the scale of consciousness.” As soon as we our- 
selves only meagerly introduce impressions into the continuity 
of our conceptions, or subsequently can only imperfectly remem- 
ber them because of their incomplete connection, we ascribe it to 
a less degree of consciousness during the special time. Among 
the lowest classes of animals, which evidently retain only the 
inmediately preceding impression, and earlier ones in rare 
instances, when they have been often repeated, we also infer 
an imperfect consciousness. In the mind of man, however, 
Conceptions long since vanished, with the exception of those 
Teceived in the first two years of existence, may, under favor- 
able conditions, be renewed, especially when they were very 
intense, and intimately connected with the affections, or had 
Sften been received and practised, though an unlimited space 
of time has passed since their first impression. 
Plato says in several places, “The impressions which man 
Teceives in childhood are the most important, as they are more 
easily impressed, and that which is learnt in youth is always
-P-A-G-E-28
20 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
retained best. What is practised from youth up gradually 
forms part of the character ; wherefore we should imitate only 
the good, and nothing bad.” 
In youth the senses should be especially exercised, the limit 
of view extended, and the views of objects be impressed upon 
the child distinctly and minutely. 
With regard to the combination and separation of ideas, 
that is, the actual mental labor, however, Alexander Bain and 
Spencer justly remark that the brain of children grows and 
gains in ability only gradually. Tasks which the child could 
not perform at all, or only with great difficulty, will be very 
easy a few years later. The child should, therefore, not have 
the abstract, but the concrete, offered it for its reception. It 
should receive no complicated and complete conception before 
it has gained possession of the simple elements which compose 
that conception, Spencer says: “As the simplest elements 
must be mastered, and as their conquest, let it take place when 
it will, takes up time, it will prove an economy to devote the 
first stage of childhood, during which no other mental labor is 
possible, to their perfect appropriation in all their modifica- 
tions. We will not overlook the fact that temper, as well as 
health, receives a favorable development from the continued 
satisfaction which results from the proper provision of these 
impressions, which every child so anxiously appropriates.” 
In the development of every faculty, strongly contrasting 
impressions are the first to be distinguished, — tones of re- 
markable difference in force and pitch ; colors least related to 
each other; objects most unlike in firmness or the combina- 
tion of their parts. The advance to more closely allied im- ; 
pressions should take place only very slowly. 
Luys says: “The brain-cells of very small children have . 
their distinct histologic character. They are soft, gray of 
color, and in a manner pliant. In their dynamic relation they 
are properly in a virgin state, as they have not as yet been 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
PSYCHOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 21 
exposed to any concussions ; and we may truly say that senso- 
rial sensations which reach the as yet unconnected cells must 
make an impression more easily, because the ability of reten- 
tion has not yet been proven.” The brain-substance of small 
children is disposed in an especially high degree to receive 
impressions, 
Where the ability of the nervous element to retain traces of 
the external impressions touching it has risen to a high degree, 
and is in permanent action, the resulting vibration in a manner 
calls forth an unconquerable erethism. This causes many 
Pathologic phenomena; in other cases this ability is abnor- 
tally small, and a partial or total failing of memory is the con- 
Sequence, 
The power of memory, especially the mere mechanical 
action of it, is strongest in childhood and youth; it decreases 
™ manhood, and still more in old age. And yet, even in 
Youth, a mild, not remarkable impression, is rarely retained if it 
only occurred once ; it must be repeated in order to remain true 
and lasting, Experiment also shows that a single sensation 
wll not visibly change the sensibility of the nerves, therefore 
it leaves no lasting impression. It is only when the sensation 
been often repeated in certain intervals, that a marked and 
ing change, a heightened sensibility, appears. Impressions 
Sccurting too often, however, and without the proper intervals, 
4 well as excessive sensations, cause a weakening of the ner- 
Yous system.’ On studying the general laws of the central 
fanctions, Wundt stated practice as the fifth main principle: 
Every element becomes more suited to a certain function the 
rit is led by external conditions to exercise it. The fre- 
Pent repetition of the same impression greatly facilitates the 
"ception of a similar one, and the repetition of various sensa- 
tions in a certain sphere of the nervous system renders possible 
the distinction of the finest differences in the force and quality 
W the seceived impressions. This causes the acuteness of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
22 HABIT IN EDUCATION, 
sensory organs of so many barbaric races, which has very 
frequently been mentioned in works of travel and psychology; 
also the great ability of painters to distinguish colors, or musi- 
cians, sounds. The frequent performance of a function lessens 
the amount of exertion necessary for a similar or more difficult 
one. The scholar who has pursued a thought often, and viewed 
it from various aspects, is enabled to comprehend a similar one 
more quickly, and pursue it farther, while a layman would find 
it impossible to grasp the same thought, or would succeed only 
after great labor. On the other hand, a workman who uses 
the powers of his nervous system mostly in physical force, will 
without difficulty, perform a physical labor to which a scholar 
would succumb.” 
The impressions and the dispositions resulting therefrom ae 
not restricted to that part of the nervous system which wa 
immediately excited, but they extend to neighboring division 
and enter into combination with each other. Very strong vand 
often repeated impressions will also excite more distant parts 
as the central portions of the spinal cord and brain are cor 
nected with each other by numerous nerve-fibres, and form 4 
complete union. Dispositions in more or less removed parts 
are released, and thus the function begins also in those pars 
not directly affected by the sensation. 
Wundt says: “After the sensation has taken place, primarily 
at the irritated point, it influences the neighboring parts, wher 
the existing molecular action now also partly changes into sel | 
sorial activity.” He distinguishes four ways in the extension of 
sensations: 1. Combination of sensific with sensitive fibre 
(sympathetic sensations). 2. Combination of sensitive with 
motor fibres (reflex motion). 3. Combination of sensitive 
with secretory fibres (reflector secretion). 4. Combination d 
sensitive and intercepting fibres (reflex interceptions). Finallj, 
the sensitive central organs may be connected with each othe 
which causes the automatic or reflexive sensation to extend # 
neighboring nerve-cells, and call forth sympathetic sensations.  
-P-A-G-E-31
PSYCHOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 23 
Sympathetic sensation and co-emotion in the spinal cord: 
both phenomena happen, without doubt, when the sensation 
spreads so far in the gray substance that not only the fibres of 
the normal course of transmission, but also further longitudinal — 
fibres of the front or rear divisions of the brain are innervated: 
In this way arise sympathetic sensations and co-emotions of 
various sorts. Shakespeare says : — 
“For let our finger ache, and it endues 
Our other healthful members ev’n to that sense 
Of pain.” 
_ And all who were ever troubled with toothache know that it 
is often difficult to localize the pain in a certain tooth, as sym- 
pathy causes a greater part of the teeth to appear sick and to 
cause pain, Just as well known is the sympathetic movement 
of the fingers, which the beginner in piano-playing can only

Such fibres as arise on different sides, and at unequal height,

tions, Inritation of the sensitive parts of the brain intercepts 
the reflex motions ; the removal of certain parts of the brain 
temoves the interception. With many narcotic poisons,

counteracted by the interception of the brain.

THE conception called forth by some incident will not 
remain isolated, but awakens a large number of other thought 
and memories, and their action continues ; finally it is inter 
cepted by another strong impression, and by the connections 
surrounding the latter led into other paths. . 
Kussmaul thinks that when the union of the functions of 
separate parts which are caused by a single impression is only, 
loose, it will grow firmer, often inseparable, by its repetition 
“Tt seems just as if impressions that repeatedly transfer them! 
selves from one point to another put aside obstructions on 
connecting paths, and make the way freer, smoother, and mor: 
traversible.” . 
According to Wundt, “there are positive and negative oF 
intercepting powers in the nerves. The former arise when the 
loose chemical combinations of the nervous elements are 
converted into firmer ones ; the latter, when firm combinations 
are changed to loose connections. 
“The balance between positive and negative molecular work 
brings forth the stationary condition of the nerve in whl.

neither its temperature changes nor any external action is per- 
formed... Through the influences of the impression the negative 
as well as the positive molecular work of the nerve is enlarged, 
External labor, muscular twitching, or irritation of the ganglia- 
cells, can be caused by the impression, only when it continually 
accelerates the positive molecular action in a greater degree 
than the negative.... After the twitching has ceased there 
will for some time be a surplus of positive molecular action, 
which appears in the strengthened effect of a second impres- 
sion. , Of the entire amount of positive molecular action which 
is set free by the irritation of the nerve, no doubt only a portion 
is changed into exciting effects, or, as we generally term it, 
appears in arousing actions ; another part may change to heat ; © 
a third, to stored-up (negative) action. The arousing action is 
only partly used in releasing external effects of irritation, mus- 
cular twitching, or irritation of the ganglia-cells, as a heightened 
imtability exists during and after convulsive motion, A newly 
approaching impression will, therefore, always find a surplus of 
aousing action. Should no new irritation take place, this 
surplus most likely changes to heat.” “Even in the periph- 
trl nerves the intercepting powers gradually decrease if an 
Mpression is repeatedly made upon them; at first, so long

it will awaken the others connected with it. If we view a lané 
scape with attention, and afterwards picture a single feature o 
it to ourselves in memory, the others will also immediately appest 
with more or less clearness. Luys says: “Ifa certain group 
of brain-cells are simultaneously subject to a course of sensorid 
impressions, a mysterious band will immediately enclose thi 
whole group so that they almost seem to form a union.” No# 
any sensation need only strike the sight, hearing, or smell, and 
in consequence of this mysterious union the other simultaneot 
impressions will immediately be reawakened as “ recollections" 
He designates this as “a powerful instrument for the education 
of the mind and the methodic development of its abilities”! 
because man can thereby attach “ series of recollections, serid! 
of conceptions, of experimental facts, and of scientific principle 
to the first recollection.” What is true regarding the inte

follow in the path of the first impression. The very first im- 
pression vibrates within us like a dim, faint echo of the past, 
and brings about the sensations of automatic life ; continually 
interposing, always the same, it invariably comes forward in the 
shape of unconscious recollections, causing regular rhythmical 
motions in which unmistakable traces of the first impression are 
revealed, 
Wundt distinguishes a double form of practice. In the first 
place, a certain separate movement, which may be more or less 
complicated, may be rendered easier by practice. This is direct 
Practice. The invariable consequence of it is that the practised 
Parts also grow more skilful in the execution of other relative 
motions. Secondly, practice may consist of the combined ex- 
ercise of different motions, which are executed by different 
Parts simultaneously or successively. This is the indirect prac- 
{ce or mutual drill. The invariable consequence of this is that 
the various motions practised together will combine more and 
More intimately, even involuntarily, with each other. Current 
examples of such combined practice are the motions of the 
ams, hands, and feet in certain mechanical performances, such 
as climbing, swimming, spinning, weaving, etc. These various 
forms of physiological practice show a complete analogy with 
the psychological forms of association. ‘There as well as here 
We find two cases: a certain emotion facilitates the occurrence 
Of a similar or related emotion, and various emotions practised 
together remain united in simultaneous or successive order, ac- 
cording to the method pursued in practising them. If to this 
‘unmistakable analogy we add the supposition developed before, 
that every conception is accompanied by a central physiologic 
Seusation, we are forced to the conclusion that every psychical 
@oclation of conceptions is accompanied by a corresponding 
Physiological association of the central innervation proceedings. 
Charles Darwin also speaks of the fact that actions, sensations, 
and feelings which happen simultaneously or in close succession

strive to combine and intermingle, and in such a way that if anj 
one of them is in future offered to the soul, the others are in 
clined to be re-awakened. Herbert Spencer says, in the preface 
to his study of sociology: “As soon as two conceptions, often 
repeated in a certain order, become united in that order, and a 
soon as muscular movements which it was at first difficult to 
combine in the proper manner, even when special attention wat 
directed thereto, grow easy by practice and finally automatic, 
this repeated generation of a certain action renders this action 
comparatively easy by aid of the sensations calling it forth.” 
Darwin hereon founds his first main principle of the expres 
sion movements, “the principle of appropriately associated’ 
habits.” Certain complicated actions are in certain conditions 
of the mind of direct or indirect use in facilitating or satisfying 
certain sensations, wishes, etc. ; and as soon as the same mental 
condition is occasioned, in however weak a way, an inclinatiot- 
to execute the same motions will be there in consequence of 
the power of habit and association, though in this case they art 
not of the least value. “All actions of consciousness appear 0 
be continually striving to combine with past and simultaneous | 
actions.” — Wundi. 
Herbart had previously placed the persistence of the wil 
parallel to the persistence of conceptions, and had spoken of & 
“ memory of the will.”

upon habitude as a result of the association of ideas. This is, 
however, mistaking the effect for the cause. He sees the close 
Telation, even the identity, between both phenomena, habitude, 
and the association of ideas as well as motions. He recognizes 
that the one phenomenon is more general, and the other only 
akind or particularity of the same ; but he-does not notice that 
association of ideas or motions is only one of the most fre- 
(uent and remarkable forms of habitude.

This definition, it is true, does not entirely correspond with | 
that of Deinhardt and Rosenkranz, but it is nevertheless not 
wholly wanting in advocates. In’ the last century the peda 
gogue Resewitz wrote: “ Like a machine, which, if continually 
turned in the same manner and moved by the same driving- 
spring, receives a decided inclination and disposition ‘to this 
mode of motion, the human soul receives a decided inclination 
and propensity for those modes of expression and feeling to 
which it has grown accustomed by repeated similar practices.” 
The physician Dr. Kussmaul says in later days: “ If we often 
combine a certain feeling or conception with a motion, the 
latter will finally take place involuntarily as soon as that feeling 
or that conception is called forth, and vice versa, Certain 
notes recall certain words to our mind, or the words, the notes, 
and we sing, or whistle, them lowly to ourselves. That bond 
which the practice of our central organs knits between various 
stations of feeling, conception, and motion, we cal] habitude. 
Stations, which are in the habit of corresponding, answer each 
other’s dispatches very promptly, while those of others are not 
answered. at all or only with hesitation and doubt.” Wundt |     
  remarks: “Many phenomena (especially the influence of 
practice on combined motions) prove that when a sensation 38 
frequently carried through the ganglia-cells in a certain direc 
tion this direction will in future cases when impressions touch

the same cells be pre-eminently disposed to act as conduct ” ; 
and at another place: “External association (according to 
co-existence in space and succession in time) rests upon a 
habit formed by repeated practice. As soon as conceptions, 
which may be without any internal connection, are repeatedly 
offered to our mind in external combination, there will be an 
inclination to renew them in the same connection. We may 
hence term the principle which is at the bottom of this form of 
associations the one of associated practice, by which we already 
show in this name that it is only a special adaptation of the 
law of Practice so all-important in all psycho-physical transac- tions,” 
Ravisson says: “ Habitude is not only a state ; it is a disposi- 
tion, avirtue. Habitude has the greater force when the change 
which has produced it continues or is often repeated.” The 
first action alone, which is preceded by no other and repeats 
Ro other, whatever may be its origin, owes nothing to habit. 
On the contrary, to it habit owes its existence. It possesses 
Primarily the power of preparing, animating, facilitating, 
those actions which follow it. “Repetition only strengthens 
habitude ; for an act even when it has not been completed more 
than a single time leaves a disposition which is the point for the 
of habit But if this first accomplishment did not 
Cteate the habitude, thousands of repetitions cannot call it 
forth, for the repetition produces little more than an accumula- 
tion, and to that accumulation every act, even the first, must 
have contributed in a certain measure.” Dumont cites Aris- 
tolle, who says that some individuals derive a stronger habit 
fom a single impression than others from oft-repeated ones. 
€ impressions themselves also have different results (as we 
Temember some we received only once more vividly than others 
Which often met our view). Habits need not be active all the 
time to retain vitality, but can éxist in a latent condition ; hence 
their intermission, their interruption. If the continuing dispo-

sition shall again be turned into a function by a new impression, 
the nerves must possess the necessary energy through a sufli- 
cient inflow of matter. Memory is dependent on the strength. 
of the blood and the energy of its circulation; he who, tired 
out by long mental labor, cannot: recall many conceptions, 
should wait until the nerves by an influx of matter have regained 
the energy necessary to perform their function. 
Lemoine claims that inorganic bodies cannot acquire any 
habit, but thinks that the acclimation of plants is nothing more 
than the acquirement of habits useful or pleasant to man 
Trees will accustom themselves to another soil, to another 
climate. Leon Dumont joins Auguste Comte, who connects 
Habit with the Law of Indolence ruling in the inorganic world; 
every body once modified would remain in that condition for- 
ever if it were not disturbed or changed in its individuality by 
some power. 
Tito Vignola and Herbert Spencer explain the same principle. 
This ability (of memory), which is founded on a universal co® 
mic law, is confirmed and strengthened by repetition, which thus 
engenders the habit, even in bodies of the inorganic world. 
Thus the periods themselves which are mirrored in all cosmi¢ | 
facts, as well as the habits of circling nature, may in part be 
ascribed, according to a forcible expression of Alighieri, to this 
inner peculiarity of things by virtue of which they retain and 
repeat the modifications, the acts, the processes, begun within of 
introduced into them. Leon Dumont attempts to illustrate the 
presence of habit in the inorganic world, and defines it 4 
follows: “ Habitude in a force is its manner of reacting oD 
other forces, a manner of reacting which results even in the 
same action which the other forces before exercised on it.” 
If we now proceed to investigate what results in general fo 
low habit and habitude, we shall find about the following :—

teg.the attainment of certain aims, but it also puts a an economic 
and practically regulated use of the motory, “muscles i in place of 
the formerly 1 unregulated and useless Waste of power and. explo- 
sive Cruptions. 
“"Ritssmaul writes: “The sprawling and kicking of the active 
child gradually change into grasping, seizing of objects, walking, 
etc,, the babbling, hissing, to the articulated word. Only the 
Hottentots and Kaffirs have permanently adopted the smack- 
ing sounds into their alphabet.” The age of youth excels 
in great activity of the imaginative power, and with regard to 
motion :- ever restless, the growing child cannot sit quiet for 
any length of time ; it runs and jumps about aimlessly. Herein 
much power is wasted, which in early years the child may not 
know how to apply better, but which in school he must change 
into attention and intellectual activity. It is impossible to 
Perform heavy physical labor, and think deeply at the same 
time, Just as an intense thought necessarily interrupts every 
outer physical action, a leap will disturb every order of 
thoughts. The vital power consumed in a leap is lost to 
the train of psycho-physical motion necessary to thought ; 
and the mind has neither the power to continue the course 
8s before, notwithstanding the loss, nor to replace the loss 
from its own perfection of power. We can, it is true, divide 
the vital power at the disposal of our will, but it always has 
its maximum, and that can only be used for one kind of 
activity in the proportion in which the others rest. Just as we 
Test one arm to employ the greatest possible power in the other, 
80 we must Jet all parts of our body rest to use the highest 
Possible power in our mind ; and wice versa, the mental activity 
Must rest as much as possible to perform movements of the 
Steatest power possible with our limbs. Hence, we see the 
deep thinker as quiet as possible, and one who runs and lifts 
burdens never at the same time in deep thought. The two 
Modes of work are opposed to each other and cannot be simul-

34 HABIT IN. EDUCATION. 
taneously pursued, The same relation which exists between 
the psycho-physical and purely physical activity also exists 
between the various divisions of the psycho-physical actions. 
To be lost in the view of an external object and think deeply 
at the same time is impossible; one cannot see and hear 
attentively at the same time. To thoroughly do one, we must 
abstain from the other; and as the attention is divided, itis 
weakened for the separate objects. “The vital power used in 
splitting wood is not only quantitatively similar to the vita 
power consumed in thinking, but they may even be inter- 
changed.” — Fechner, 
The child should therefore learn aN sit still, and save its 
power; it must be accustomed to be passive in order to have 
the power for a decided active exertion at the proper time. 
The youth will sometimes revel in fantastic, impracticable ideals, 
and the maiden often show great sentimentalism. Habitude 
should save both from useless waste of intellectual power, 80 
that it may in the latter case be used beneficially in practical 
life, and in the former be devoted to the execution of valuable 
and practicable ideas. The youth, perhaps even the mat, 
grows dissatisfied with the existing conditions of the world; ia 
hasty and thoughtless love of liberty he attempts to break 
through the barriers which public law has raised, and widen 
the field of his activity. Habitude must here exercise its bene- 
ficial influence from the earliest years; the boy must learn to 
look upon obedience to his parents and teacher as a ster 
necessity, that he may gain reverence for authority and learn to 
bow to it even when in future this authority is no longer repre 
sented by parents and teachers, but by other persons, and by 
existing laws and ordinances, ‘The child shall be accustomed 
to obey without a murmur, that the adult may not use up his 
best strength in a thoughtless strife against circumstances and 
his own self, but know how to use his power within the set 
bounds in a beneficial way.
-P-A-G-E-43
PROPERLY ASSOCIATED HABITS. 35 
Lazarus, in his “ Lectures on Pedagogy,” says: “The motto 
‘mens sana in corpore sano’ is frequently misused ; for there 
have been many great scholars and sages who uttered very 
sound thoughts, and yet had a feeble body. The greatest part 
of the power of the nervous system is here used for the intel- 
lectual function.” Haller and Arneman furthermore found many 
cases where not only in an ailment of small parts, but even in 
widespread diseases of the brain, the psychical functions remain 
undisturbed in consequence of the vicariate of other parts of 
the brain. Every one, however, who suffers from a feeble body 
must exercise a certain energy to conquer the pressure of phys- 
ical pain, and this power which he uses in a negative way could 
be used with more benefit in positive, useful action, It has 
also been proven that in cases of apparently undisturbed 
mental functions, during brain disease, like those mentioned 
above, these actions were of shorter duration. 
The distinction between negative and positive use of power 
may, however, be extended to the ethic-social life. In every 
Private enterprise, a large part of the attention, in every state, 
an important part of judicial and police labor, is caused simply 
by the dishonesty of many persons. Could this be put aside, 
and every one be fully trusted, it would be possible to devote 
fx more power and time to positively useful works. 
, Neither should the boy weaken his power by dividing it, even 
in the pursuit of lawful ends. With perfect justice Lotze in his 
Medical psychology points to the two principal dangers, —a 
too great limitation and a too great enlargement of the circle 
of impressions and actions. It is true, a broad education and 
Wide activity have an inestimable value ; it is, however, univer- 
uly known that really great things are only accomplished by 
Concentration, For which reason man should early be accus- 
tomed to place limits for himself, not to make his sphere. of 
Usefulness too small, neither to extend it immeasurably, but to 
“oncentrate his energy, especially upon those actions which are
-P-A-G-E-44
36 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
best suited to his talents, and which are placed in his way by 
external circumstances or inner self-consecration. He dare 
not thoughtlessly spring from one decision to another, now take 
up this work, now that; but he should steadily follow the plan 
once adopted, and firmly execute it with concentrated power.” 
Lazarus, in his “ Lectures on Pedagogy,” speaks of the psychol- 
ogy of indolence, and points out the following facts. (1) Lazi- 
ness is often not dread of labor in general, but of some especial 
labor; there are people who are always very busy, and do 
everything except just that which they should do, (2) The 
putting off from to-day to to-morrow; many letters are not 
written because the paper was not in the usual place, etc. 
(3) Dread of the beginning; when the work is once begun, 
it is continued with a certain delight. (4) Diligence of idle- 
ness. Many children go to work with quick energy, not from 
a special love for it, but to get through with it and back to 
their play as soon as possible. We find similar incidents 
among adults. Plutarch mentions that many soldiers in Otho’s 
army, foremost among them the Pretorians, pressed forth to 
battle, less from actual bravery and courage than a desire that 
the war should soon end, and they be at liberty in the shortest 
possible time to revel in the pleasures of the capital. 
We said above that with regard to the functions of motion, 
habitude was useful in causing a union of separate parts. Ina 
few cases it must, however, separate the natural connection to 
prevent a useless exercise of power. The sympathetic motions 
can, and must, occasionally be set aside by practice and habi- 
tude. The child must be accustomed to give one impressiot 
time to take root, and not follow it immediately by a corre- 
sponding action, that it may not pass away with that action into 
air. Lazarus also says: “Deep thinking requires time; it is 
therefore a great pedagogical mistake if teachers—-as is now 
generally done — urge their pupils to answer rapidly, and praise 
those who immediately have an answer ready. This caused
-P-A-G-E-45
PROPERLY ASSOCIATED HABITS. 37 
everything to be lowered to a mere effort of mechanical memory. 
The pupils should be given time for individual contemplation, 
for deep and energetic thought-labor.” This is, however, only 
telatively true. The theorist, it is true, must lay less stress upon 
rapidity than on the profundity of thought; in practical life, 
however, rapidity of decision and immediate application of the 
knowledge gained are of immense value ; and schools have to 
educate not only theoretical thinkers, but also energetic, practi- 
cal men, 
Kussmaul is right when he says: “All human education 
aims at the control of inborn and acquired reflexes by sensible 
and rational motives.” : 
( Hasrrupe srRENGTHENS Power.}— Every member of the

side, as is frequently successfully done, in case the ability to 
write is lost by an injury to one of the hands.” — Xussmavk, 
Wundt, in his study of the general laws of central functions, 
points to the fact that the fifth main principle, that of “prac 
tice,” is especially effective in connection with the fourth, that 
of “localized functions,” as well as the third, the “ substituting 
functions”; this explains the fact that when certain parts are 
injured or degenerated, the vicariate of others will only begit 
slowly and gradually. 
In the same way the acuteness of sensation of some barbaric 
races mentioned above, the ability of painters to distinguish 
color, of musicians sounds, as well as the skill of any artist, is 
only possible by unremitting practice from youth on, It is well 
known how Demosthenes, by stubborn practice, conquered the 
drawbacks of a feeble body and a defective organ, and becamt 
a great orator. Even those unfortunate ones who are debarred 
from one or more sensory fields may, by practice and conced 
tration of power, accomplish astonishing performances by the 
aid of those senses left them, The deaf, mute, and blind Laua 
Bridgman reached a comparatively high grade of intelligenct | 
by the untiring practice of her sense of touch. If now We 
turn from these unfortunate ones to the “ favorites of the gods” 
who, as geniuses endowed by nature with glorious gifts, ha 
erected for themselves monuments, lasting to the end of timé 
by their imperishable works in science and art, we shall recog 
nize that the talent, it is true, was the condition of their gre# 
deeds, but that these men would never have reached so high# 
point if they had not developed and enlarged their talent by | 
    steady practice from early youth. 
Thus, aside from the manifold dispositions of the brain, th | 
finer structure of a sensory organ may often determme a certaid 
talent in music and painting, because the ease of its functiol 
creates a desire to perform it further, and thus leads to skill aod 
talent. |

PROPERLY ASSOCIATED HABITS, 39 
Yes, in all intellectual actions habit strengthens by a concen- 
tration of power. By a repetition of the conceptions, it offers 
mana clearer picture of the external real world. Pestalozzi, in 
his essay, “ How Gertrude teaches her children,” says: “ Chil- 
dren in their earliest years need a psychological guidance to a 
national view of things. We should restrict ourselves in the de- 
velopment of their mind: (1) To widen continually the circle 
of their conceptions. (2) To impress upon them, firmly and. 
distinctly, the conceptions brought to their consciousness. (3) 
To give them an ample knowledge of speech for all with which 
tature and art have made them acquainted. The preparations 
for the development of our powers are principally confined to 
Placing before us in a smaller circle, and in a regular series, 
what nature presents to us at greater distances and in tangled 
relations, and bringing it closer to our five senses, in relations 
Which facilitate and strengthen our outer and inner receptivity 
for all impressions, and raise and enlarge our senses themselves, 
daily presenting to them the objects of the world in greater 
mumbers, more durably, and more correctly.” Spencer says: 
If the education of the senses has been neglected, all later 
ducation has about it something sleepy, blurred, insufficient, 
Which itis impossible ever to make good again. The man, busy 
M practical life, in art and science, needs his own power of ob- 
Sevation, for which reason it should be already developed in 
the child. Object lessons should not only be given in a way 
Satirely different from the one generally'used, but should also 
| beextended to a much larger circle of objects, and be continued 
‘oa much later age than is now done. They should not be 
Confined to the contents of a house, but include all that fields, 
Woods, quarries, and the seashore offer. They should not cease 
With early childhood, but be continued during youth in a way 
Yhich gradually and imperceptibly leads to the investigation of 
the naturalist and the scientist.”

which, in consequence of the limits of our discursive thinking

developed. Lazarus says: “ As the gods of the Epicureay 
dwell in the space between the worlds, so the thoughts live le 
tween the separate elements, that is, in their combination’ 
True! but before this combination can be made, and th 
thought be shown a dwelling-place, the elements for the uni 
must have been gained by experience and study. The acquired 
material, it is true, need not always be “examinable” in orde 
to be used and consumed, but it is of the greatest important 
in practical life always to have experience and knowledge # 
hand. Many great minds, as Leibnitz, Lessing, Kant, At 
totle, and others, distinguished themselves by extensive pos: 
tive knowledge, and showed that it agrees very well with a pot 
erful mental activity and productivity. Leibnitz even took 
“Clearness in words, usefulness in matter” for his motto, al 
sought in every way to make practical use of his learning al 
thoughts. J. B. Meyer thinks the scientist, as well as the poth 
needs the power of imagination; and Wundt remarks that 
neither imagination nor mental power alone, but a union 
both, produces talent and genius, Bain, in “Mind aad 
Body,” speaks of the number of impressions man can beats 
memory. Memory shows great individual differences, W 
were formerly classified in a very superficial way after their ob 
jects; they distinguished a word, number, fact, memory, 
It is, however, better to take the number and energy of the ine 
pressions into consideration, and call the memory (1) comp 
hensive, when the number of impressions at its command 
large ; (2) faithful, when it reproduces the impressions for* 
long time, and in but little changed aspect; (3) quick, wh 
it can rapidly reproduce impressions. (A faithful and @ i 
memory are but rarely found united in high degrees.) Farther 
more, we distinguish according to the processes active in 
reproduction, (2) mechanical memories, which rest on 
association of ideas ; and (4) logical, which depend on the log 
cal union of impressions. ‘The former is specially active ‘

youth in memorizing, and of value in learning languages, etc., in 
the main, in appropriating matter. Later in life this grows 
weaker, and the logical memory takes its place; this is active 
in the study of scientists and preachers. The excellence of 
memory in children has often been termed the first measure of 
talent, . 
Attentive transcription is a great aid to memory, as by the 
distinct placing of every separate element in writing, the entire 
seties of perceptions is strengthened and confirmed ; while of 
hasty taking of notes we may still say as of old, the discovery 
of writing harmed memory. ‘The so-called “Mnemonics,” or 
atof memory, which is said to have been discovered by the 
Greck Simonides, and found especial honor during the middle 
ages, has a decidedly bad effect, as it burdens the memory with 
‘co many unnecessary minor impressions. Waitz adds that 
pupil is accustomed by mnemonics to view and mark 
fverything according to chance external combinations; he 
es or weakens his sense and interest for the comprehension 
of the internal connection, forms more or less mechanical 
'ggtepations from the masses of his thoughts, and is thereby 
led to the path of polymathy, where thoroughness is valued 
‘cording to the accumulated masses, and man feels content

Wundt treats of the various methods of the combination of 
conceptions. I, Associative combinations : among which he not 
only classes those of conceptions following upon each other, but 
also those in general which are produced by any relations of the 
conceptions to each other, without the immediate co-working of 
the apperception (active attention). He distinguishes : 1. Sim- 
ultaneous association. 4, Associative synthesis. The composi-

ments. In intense synthesis a number of similar sensations

similar sensations unite. . A conception of some space through

synthesis, that is, a union of impressions following one another, 
in which the latter no longer exist in the new conception pro- 
duced by their union. (See Note 9.) From a blending of ideas 
arise the shifting and condensing of impressions. In the blend- 
ing processes, every new element which is admitted eliminates 
some of earlier date ; in the agglutinative unions the old ele- 
ments are retained, though new ones are added. Condensa- 
tion of ideas is often followed by the reverse process, viz., 
the analysis of the produced collective impressions into a series 
of successive ideas; the dissolving of ideas: this may take 
place in the same or any other order as that in which the blend- 
ing of the separate elements proceeded. A dissolution ‘takes 
place, especially where the union of elements has become so 
close that they can no longer be distinctly perceived sepa- 
rately, (See Note 10.) C, The ideas, 2, The successive 
combination of thoughts: 4, the simple; 2, the compound 
Processes of thought. 
Oft-repeated elements stand out more prominently in the 
separate impressions ; those which accord well with each other 
remain, and are strengthened; the incongruous ones are 
smoothed over and blurred; thus schematic conceptions and 
ideas are produced. Wundt defines “a conception,” accord- 
ing to its psychological development, as “the complete blend- 
ing, through active apperception, of a ruling single impression 
with a series of conpected impressions.” Since the time of 
Socrates, thinking in conceptions has justly been looked upon 
as an ideal, as it permits man, notwithstanding the narrowness 
of his consciousness, to gather a number of phenomena in his 
conscious mind by a few such “ representative concepts.” 
Practice makes the master of intellectual activity, and causes 
thinking to become easy, so that many things, as chess, and 
heavy literature, which cause others great effort, offer recrea- 
tion to the practised thinker, just as the peasant boy, used to 
hard labor, looks upon bowling as a recreation. Fechner says,
-P-A-G-E-54
46 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
* according to the measure in which the mind grasps higher rela- 
tions, it feels a stronger need of employing them, and is more 
easily bored when they must be missed.” Special dispositions, 
but still oftener, frequently repeated mental functions, produce 
distinct habits of thought; the objects are viewed in a certain 
way, the conceptions combined in a certain manner, and thus 
artifices of thought are developed. “Just as surely as every 
one possesses peculiarities of physical action which distinguish 
him from his fellow-men, he possesses peculiarities of mental 
activity which give their distinct character to his conceptions. 
There are artifices of thought as well as those of muscular 
movement. There is an acquired mental skill for recognizing 
things from an especial point, as well as a physical dexterity 
for developing distinct directions of bodily power. And there 
are intellectual perversities which are called forth by a certain 
treatment of the mind as there are certain incurable physical 
awkwardnesses which result from certain daily-repeated ac- 
tions.” People who have an especial faculty for the accumula- 
tion of perceptions rarely care to generalize, while persons 
inclined to generalize are generally such as mostly use the 
thoughts of others, and who themselves observe, less from an 
interest in special facts, than from the wish to make use of 
these facts. This contrast may be followed in yet narrower 
limits between general and special thinking. Those who are 
inclined to far-reaching speculations rarely pursue with success 
investigations which have to be confirmed by separate truths, 
while the scientific specialist generally has but little inclination 
to busy himself with wide points of view. This will suffice to 
make plain that. formal habits of thought have their source in 
special forms of mental action, and that every one’s habits of 
thought influence his judgment of every question placed before 
him. . It will also seem clear that, in proportion as the ques- 
tion is involved and many-sided, the habits of thought must 
form a more important factor in their effect on the conclusion 
reached.

THE INTELLECT. 47 
Wundt, in his lecture on psychology, speaks of the various 
forms of talent resulting from a combination of imagination 
and intellect, and proposes the following table : —

tion; 4, mathematician, 
preponderance of an: 
alyzing intellect. 
Often several of these forms will be united in one mind, but 
rarely the higher or highest grades of each. Even as regards 
intuitive imagination, in which the separate impressions possess 
great liveliness and sensible vivacity, and combining imagina- 
tion, in which the union of the separate elements is more 
prominent, “a development in both directions to any great 
degree is very rare, for the greater the sensational strength of 
the separate imaginative conceptions is, the more difficult will 
it be for the perception to change quickly from one to an- 
other.” Still more is this the case in a union of imagination 
and intellectual disposition. “Those talents especially are 
rarely united which imply an opposite course of the imagina- 
tion as well as of the intellect, such as the observing and the 
speculative, the inventive and the analyzing talent.” Goethe 
possessed the first and second of the above forms, but he was 
an enemy of all speculation, especially mathematics ; the math- 
ematician Gauss combined the third and fourth, but he lacked

48 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
the power of observation ; in the same way most philosophers 
are bad observers. Great talent is mostly one-sided, as in 
consequence of the early interest in a certain direction, power 
concentrates itself more and more in that direction, and the 
other branches are thus developed less.

EDUCATION. 
“ Hasrrupe is of no less importance to the will than to the 
intellect. Herbart justly draws a parall \between/,the per- 
sistency of impressions, and speaks of a\memory of thé will.” 
He investigates its importance in the formation of firm prin- 
ciples and character, and says: “This much is certain, a person 
whose will, like the impressions of the’ memory, does not 
without effort appear the same whenever the cause is renewed 
—who must come back to. his former resolve by contemplation 
—will have great trouble in forming his character. And it is 
because this natural perseverance of the will is not often, found 
in children, that training has so much to do in forming it.” 
Kern says: “Training must supplement the disposition with 
regard to the memory of the will.” Herbert Spencer writes : 
“Not by precept, though it be daily heard; not by example, 
unless it be followed; but only through action, which is often 
called forth by the relative feeling, can a moral habit be formed. 
The more frequently the conscious will has brought the con- 
ception-process into a certain direction, and led it to a distinct 
action, the less power will he need to do it again; the more 
easily will man -pursue the same course in his thoughts and 
actions.” Leon Dumont says: “The will has two forms: its 
action is either an inner one, and points to conceptions and
-P-A-G-E-58
50 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
their union (apperception) ; or an external one, and - produces 
physical motion. The former is the original one, and precedes 
the other.” Wundt writes: “Under favorable conditions the 
two forms, that is, the apperception of an impression and the re- 
acting motion, take place at the same time. By saving power 
and strengthening the intellect and will-efforts, habit aids us in 
reaching the appointed goal with greater ease, be it in deep 
theoretic thinking or in the energetic actions of practical life.” 
Less favorable is the influence of habit —as we shall see 
more minutely later on — upon the emotions. But even here 
it is not without value: with regard to the higher, aesthetic feel- 
lings, habit causes a liking for coarseness gradually to recede, 
and an appreciation of the finer and more delicate shades to 
take its place, as the relations of an educated ideal life, which 
permit the true appreciation of a work of art, are only gained 
by oft-repeated impressions. Religious feeling must often be 
strengthened in the belief and joyous tristin the providence of 
God, and thus be practised before Religion can become the real 
comforter in all woes of life, and can give and confirm inner 
peace, the moral feelings receive their true strength only by the 
repeated view of goodness and personal good actions. 
Habitude, by a repetition of impressions and the actions fol- 
lowing them! as reaction, exercises a greatinfluence on the entire 
psychical life. Aside from the already mentioned favorable effect 
which habit has in giving the continued satisfaction of success by 
a summing up of the separate feelings in every mental and phy- 
sical labor, the constancy ruling within it lends to the whole 
being and actions of man an individual stamp. All physical 
actions have their certain pyschical reflex, which, by its frequent 
repetition, becomes a condition, and the peculiarities of the 
repeated thought, emotion, and will form themselves into abid- 
ing characteristic qualities.

self. On the other hand, good examples in Life and History 
have a vast influence on the soul of the child as the rage for 
imitation in every direction is strongest in early youth. Parents 
and teachers should therefore take care that—as Plato and 
Plutarch justly observe — they themselves as well as the sur- 
rounding company set the child a good example. It is true this 
is not always possible in consequence of various circumstances, 
for what Niemeyer once said still holds good: “If among 
the lower classes the children are left to themselves, and must 
carry on their games in summer on the grass, in winter in court 
and hall, because the parents are busy in the field, in the work- 
shop, and about the house; the children of the upper classes 
must depart from the presence of their parents, because these 
have to fulfil their day’s labor in the assemblies, at the dinners 
and suppers, at balls, in the theatres, and at court. The nur- 
series of the higher classes are the meeting-places of nurses and 
servants ; in the most favorable cases these are uneducated and 
stupid, in less favorable ones they are coarse and corrupt people. 
The mother herself is often kept from her children by the claims 
of society. “Those families are therefore justly to be considered 
fortunate in which intelligent, unpretending women, educational 
assistants, or even older sisters, can at such times share the care 
with the mother, and employ the little ones in the proper way.” 
Rousseau puts to every father the demand to educate his son 
himself, so that “hired persons” may not gain the love of his 
child. He likewise speaks of the importance of keeping all 
impure impressions at a distance. “It. is very desirable that 
the child should never receive any impure impressions from its 
surroundings, as these impressions, even when they are after- 
wards kept down by an energetic will, suddenly reappear in 
moments when the will is, or can be, less effective, and with
-P-A-G-E-60
52 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
morally good persons just in the same measure in which they 
were formerly suppressed.” 
Association is of as much value, especially in youth, to the 
intellectual as to the moral life. Goethe truly says in “Truth 
and Fiction”: “The academic life, even if we cannot praise 
our actual diligence, offers endless privileges of education in 
every way, because we are ever surrounded by men who possess 
science or are in search of it, so that, though it may be uncon- 
sciously, we gain some nourishment in such an atmosphere.” 
Personal intercourse with the tutors especially offers this mental 
food in great quantities, a fact which even now is not duly 
appreciated by the students. 
Rousseau speaks of the benefit derived from intercourse with 
prominent intellectual men in Paris: “Far more is learned 
from an intercourse with the authors than from their books. 
And even the authors are not the ones from whom most is 
learned ; it is the spirit of the society which develops a thinking 
brain, and widens the mental horizon as much as possible.” 
It is well known of what advantage the intercourse and good 
example of a refined society, in which we dare not “indulge 
our inclinations,” is to the formation of good manners. Man 
easily adopts the manners of those with whom he frequently 
associates, particularly when he honors and loves them; and 
what was formerly but a strange example confronting him, 
gradually and imperceptibly becomes his own thought and 
action. Zhe habitude of personal action, however, has a far 
greater effect than the good precepts of others. 
The family, the parental home in which the man was born 
and spends his infancy, is where he receives these repeated 
impressions! There is a vast difference between a man who 
was raised in a thoroughly moral family, and one who spent his 
youth among people of looser morals, even criminals. The son 
of a professor receives manifold, imperceptible impressions 
even in childhood, which facilitate and hasten his intellectual
-P-A-G-E-61
\rae WILL. 53 
development; he ean reach the appointed goal quicker, and 
with less effort, than the child of persons whose intellect is less 
developed, who must gradually outgrow the opinions and views 
adopted in childhood, and conquer the bad influence of his 
surroundings by inherent power. The child of parents occu- 
pying a high social position will, aside from the influence of 
inheritance, be early advised by parents and teachers, of all the 
requirements of social life, and thus soon and easily acquires 
the assurance and firmness. of fine manners; while, he who 
grew up with another class, and spent his childhood among 
uneducated, even rough people, will, notwithstanding all his 
later efforts to make these social forms his own, be exposed to 
many slights and bitter insults, and sometimes experience in 
his own life the truth of “ Naturam expellas furca tamen usque 
recurret”! As the moral, intellectual, and social state of the 
family is of vast importance, so also the love of order, harmony, 
and industry, etc., reigning there will exercise a great influence 
on the child. Plato, in several of his works, shows that the best 
training for boys and youths does not consist of precepts and 
rules, but in letting them continually see some one do that which 
he admonishes others to do; he points to the fact that those 
Persian kings who were born on the throne became unfit for 
tulers in consequence of their effiminate training, while others, 
like Cyrus and Darius, who did not receive this effeminate 
education, excelled as powerful monarchs. Wealth, he says, 
exercises an injurious influence on the soul; and too great 
poverty drives through discomfort to shamelessness ; that 
amount of wealth which neither entices to flattery nor compels 
want is the most desirable in his opinion. 
Goethe says: “Children, as aspiring natures, generally 
choose at home the example of him who seems to live and 
enjoy life most. They see in a father who makes himself com- 
fortable the distinct rule according to which they must arrange 
their habits; and because they gain this insight early, their
-P-A-G-E-62
54 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
wishes and desires mostly grow in great disproportion to the 
powers of the house.\'They soon find themselves limited on 
every side; the more so as every new generation makes new 
demands; and parents, on the other hand, would prefer to 
grant their children only what they themselves enjoyed in 
former times, when every one was content to live in a more 
temperate and simple manner. Subordinates obey no one more 
readily than him who rules without feeling bound by his own 
commands.” Waitz says: “Where the external relations render 
the fulfilment of almost every wish possible, where many per- 
sons are always occupied with a child, one of whom will cer- 
tainly grant what the other refuses, where they are only anxious 
to keep the child merry and friendly for the present moment, 
it will not learn to subordinate its desires to a higher power, for 
it wants the experience that there is such a power, which 
demands subjection without fail; and in consequence hereof, 
it will fall an easy prey to the chance play of sensual desires, 
and the inner discord they occasion.” YW Waitz also shows. that 
the order or disorder prevailing in the house are unconsciously 
transferred by the child to the mental and moral state of the 
world. Not unjustly has poverty been termed the school of 
great men, only it must not be too severe so that it may not 
depress the courage of man, harm his character, render the 
education of his faculties impossible, and cause him to perish. 
If this is not the case, narrow circumstances serve to encourage 
children to strive to attain something by their own exertions, 
and thus strengthen their energy. The literature of ancient as 
well as modern times is teeming with proofs of this fact, and if 
we wanted to mention all those who, in more practical fields 
arose from limited conditions, their name would be legion ! ! In

should remain unexpressed. If it, however, comes out more 
or less strongly, its cause is often not taken into consideration 
enough in judging such people. 
The number of members in the family, the age and sex 
of the other inmates, the religion and the occupation of the 
father, exercise a great influence. The children very often 
enter the saine occupation as their father, because they early 
become accustomed to this circle of thought. The daily busi- 
ness of the parents is often spoken about, and the child there- 
fore early grows acquainted with all the impressions connected 
therewith ; it imitates those occupations, and learns to love 
them, even before it is able to understand their object. The 
conditions among which it grows up decide whether in its 
imagination it exercises as a soldier, or busies itself with books 
like a scholar, begins this or that occupation, etc. — Waits. 
The influence of the mother on the soul of the child has 
justly been dwelt upon to a great extent in prose and poetry, 
and Pestalozzi remarks: “The picture of its mother, which 
accompanies it everywhere, becomes itself the conscience of 
the child.” Of greatest importance is the choice of playmates 
and friends, also the association with schoolmates and univer- 
sity students, etc. Waitz writes: “Thus obstinacy and per- 
verseness are more easily cured by schoolmates than even by 
parents and teachers, as the former oppose him who appears 
quarrelsome and moody with nothing but simple inattention ; 
they do not concern themselves about him, and therefore gen- 
erally see him among themselves again in a short time, led 
back by his social wants. Vanity and conceit also remain 
unheeded, or are compelled to withdraw in shame and hide 
before the ridicule of their companions. Power finds its 
master, and is thereby saved from self-deception. Awkward- 
ness is laughed at and thus forced to attention and effort. 
Indolence is spurred on, effeminacy forced to deny itself. 
Diffidence is encouraged to come forth. Security of physical
-P-A-G-E-64
56 HABIT IN EDUCATION, 
health, rapid and versatile progress in knowledge, but especially 
an understanding of self, and a power of self-control in thought 
and action, the individual can only acquire by a life in com- 
pany with others.” 
This good influence of associates, therefore, forms the 
principal advantage of school-education in contrast to home 
education, Pestalozzi pointed out the prominent fact: 
“Father’s and mother’s punishments rarely make a bad im- 
pression. A wholly different effect is produced by the punish- 
ment of school and other teachers. While in the family love 
rules, in school the legitimacy of law comes to the front. The 
advantages which private education offers, the consideration of 
individuality, and the rapid progress of intelligence do not 
balance the advantages which a school-education offers. The 
continual supervision in the former is not always useful; it 
may even be harmful.” Bain remarks: “The presence of a 
large assembly exercises an electric influence on the individual 
and arouses it, Every effort in presence of a visitor is hereby 
changed and deepened in its character. This is effected in 
class instruction, and the drilling of large masses of soldiers, 
because all strive to reach the general level.” 
Not only the persons among whom the child spends the first 
years of its life, but the entire outer environment and material 
relations in which these years are spent, are by the frequent 
repetition of certain impressions of vast importance for its 
intellectual development. The condition should not vary too 
much so that it may occasion the reproduction of the same 
wishes. They should furthermore be simple enough for the 
child to see through them, and determine whether any new 
relations are introduced, or merely old ones involved. Fre- 
quent change of the condition of life is injurious to proper 
training as well as to the consolidation of a train of thoughts. 
Jean Paul writes in his autobiography: “Truly there is even a 
greater misfortune than to be at the capital, and that is, to be
-P-A-G-E-65
THE WILL. 57 
carried, as the child of noble parents, for years through foreign 
cities and among strange people, and to know no other home 
than the coach.” Lazarus shows that by far the greatest num- 
ber of Roman authors who afterwards attained celebrity were 
not bom in Rome itself; he thinks the cause of their greatness 
may be found in the impressions of their early youth ; the child 
in the country has simpler but oft-repeated impressions ; hence 
they endure longer and the psychical actions become more 
concentrated while the rapidly changing and varying impres- 
sions of the metropolis are more volatile, remain a less time 
themselves, and yet render the inner concentration more diffi- 
cult. Lazarus speaks of a “Tempo of Thinking,” and points 
out that people who perform physical labor slowly, also think 
slowly ; that, furthermore, country people who are known for 
the clumsiness of their thoughts excel in a firmness of will, and 
are principally the ones who in battle “stand as a wall.” (On 
the other hand, the peculiarities of many important talents, the 
rapid change of motives for actions as well as thoughts, may be 
explained by the great variability of physical life in general. 
Every one has the faults of his virtues!) Too great unwield- 
iness is, however, useless and harmful in life; to many peas- 
ant boys the years of military drill are of great advantage in 
lessening the clumsiness of their movements and carriage, as 
well as of their thoughts. 
We may, indeed, find that the large intercourse and the 
varied impressions of the metropolis mostly educate quick 
children who are always ready with an answer, show no diffi- 
dence, and always appear self-conscious in conversation, but 
who, later on, excel less in concentration of thoughts, and that 
a quick superficiality is considered by them of more value than 
great depth of thought. Do not many scientists withdraw from 
the noise and whirl of the large city into solitude if they wish 
to finish a work requiring clear, sharp, and concentrated 
thought? It is true, we must remember that practical life also
-P-A-G-E-66
58 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
requires presence of mind and quick readiness. Kern justly 
remarks that “regularity of life should not degenerate into 
monotony, simplicity into want.” Lotze writes: “Monotony 
ag well as a continual change of impressions provokes a dis- 
turbance of the train of thoughts, desolation and dreamlike 
stupor in the former ; psychical vertigo and want of control in 
the latter case.” If concentration has been taught in youth, a 
change of the surroundings will prove very beneficial, even 
necessary ; it is well known what benefit a mature youth or 
man derives from travelling, which causes him to recognize 
other conditions than those prevailing at home, and thus gives 
him a survey of life and strengthens his character and energy. 
“Man must issue forth into hostile life,” for a talent may be 
formed in “solitude,” but a character only in “the rush of the 
world.” — Zasso and Antonio. 
“ A noble man cannot in narrow bounds 
His wisdom gain. Home and the distant world 
Must influence him. Fame and reproach 
He there must learn to bear with calm. Self and 
Others is he taught to know full well. No 
Longer will solitude gently soothe him. 
Enemies will not, friends dare not, spare him. 
Thus while struggling, the youth gains his power, 
Feels what he is, and feels himself a man.” 
Locke, however, truly remarks that travelling into foreign lands 
will be of great use to a man only when he is familiar enough 
with the affairs of his native land to be able to exchange origi- 
nal opinions and personal experience with the people he 
meets, and to compare and combine the new impressions with 
those already acquired.

of the chosen vocation bring man impressions which by fre- 
quent repetition grow and give him an indivi@--" -----  ™

well as the circumstances surrounding these, exercised a dis- 
tinct psychical refiex, which in consequence of the repetition 
gradually became a characteristic quality. The mercurial bar- 
ber -has different characteristic qualities from the butcher or 
cooper or smith. Lazarus even thinks that the volatileness, the 
inclination to busy themselves with politics, and other qualities 
which tailors show, may be explained by the fact that they have 
light and rapid work which occupies only their hands and dur- 
ing which they can speak and sing, while the shoemaker, who, 
in consequence of his labor with wire and frequent drawing and 
stretching of the leather, can talk less and only think — inclines 
more to mystic and philosophic reflections. The dancing-mas- 
ter and artist differ in character from the silent thinker. The 
farmer and laborer accustomed to physical labor, as well as the 
merchant who moves mostly in practical life, have a different 
view of life, and look upon everything from a more practical 
standpoint than the teacher or scholar who is accustomed to 
indulge in profound thoughts and reflections and speculations 
about the value of his ideal mental possessions. The lawyer 
who by his business remains in more frequent intercourse with 
the outer world is generally, like the officer, a better social com- 
panion than the theoretical thinker who spends most of his time 
in study over his books. He who would care to write a psy- 
chological investigation of the peculiarities of military character 
could not only show that the dexterity of the officer in social 
forms is connected with the precision and rapidity of move- 
ment acquired in his official activity, but also that the strong 
class-feeling, aside from the influence of inheritance and sur- 
roundings, is largely due to the erect carriage, to the close-fit- 
ting dress — which with the body also holds the soul together. 
Every one can easily observe how much freer and braver he 
will feel while walking erect in the open air than while at work 
in his study or office. Fechner attempts to show us that an 
imitation of the physical expression of a foreign mental condi-
-P-A-G-E-68
60 HABIT IN EDUCATION, 
tion will teach us to understand the latter much better than a 
mere view of this expression. 
The repetition of certain actions and functions caused by 
habit is what, next to the degree of education, creates the opin- 
ion of rank, and causes the different classes to have different 
views of the world and life in general. The same will also be 
seen in the history of nations. At all times there were distinct 
national characters which were caused in part by the influence 
of climate and nature in general, by the degree of enlightenment, 
etc., but principally by the habits continued through many 
generations. The Athenian, cherishing arts and science and the 
ideals of life, thought differently from the Spartan, who espe-

difference between the impressions and the whole psychical life 
of the sexes is caused partially by distinct physical impressions 
by the earlier or later development, but also by the difference 
of position in life and social intercourse as well as all the expe- 
riences called forth thereby. Women have a greater inclination 
for the concrete than men because they are more dependent 
upon it from youth up. ‘Girls gather less mental store than 
boys, and use it more rapidly but with less diversity and divis- 
ion.) Spencer goes even farther, and explains characteristic 
peculiarities of women in the Darwinian way, by saying that in 
former times the women possessing these particular qualities in 
greater degrees than others found more approval and were 
chosen for the propagation of the species, whence these qualities 
were transmitted by inheritance, and during a continuance of 
the favorable circumstances were brought to greater promi- 
nence, 
It is plain that under otherwise similar circumstances, among 
women who lived by the favor of the men, those who succeeded 
best in pleasing were most likely the ones who remained alive. 
And, if we take into consideration the prevailing transmission 
of habits on one side, it will lead in a series of generations to 
the effect that a special striving after praise, and the ability of 
developing the whole nature for this purpose, appears as a dis- 
tinctly feminine trait. In a similar way, the wives of cruel 
savages under like circumstances must have had an easy time 
in proportion to their ability to hide their feelings.... In 
some cases, again, the arts of persuasion enabled woman to 
protect herself and children, where a lack of these arts would 
have caused her to disappear early. A further ability may be’ 
called the power of quickly distinguishing the volatile feelings 
of those surrounding her. A woman who, in barbarous times, 
could immediately detect the rising passion of her wild husband 
by the tone of voice, a slight motion, or the expression of his 
face, probably escaped dangers which a woman less able to

‘understand the natural language of emotion was obliged to 
endure. From the continued practice of this ability, and the 
success of those possessing it, we may infer that it took root as 
a distinctly feminine trait.... The effect which the show of 
power, of whatever kind, by men, has on the affections of 
women, is widely discussed by Spencer. He thinks that 
among women of unequal taste, those who were charmed by 
manly, physical, or mental power, and married men able to 
protect them, enjoyed longer life than those pleased with 
“weaker men. To this inevitable admiration for power may be 
ascribed the fact which has caused so much discussion: that 
women generally care more for men who maltreat them if the 
rudeness is accompanied by physical power, than for weaker 
men who treat them well. With the progress. of culture, the 
admiration for physical power gradually changed into that for 
mental power in every field, and from this developed the feeling 
of reverence in viewing all that which betrays conspicuous 
power or ability, —the respect for authority, etc. In this way 
we can also explain the inconsistency pf women, their skill in 
quickly turning any action SEOMET hay, and giving to their 
own expressions, as well as those of others, a meaning suitable 
to the time, but often entirely different from the origial one 
For, as they could well use these little aids in reconciling their 
angry husbands, these qualities have gradually been inherited 
and strengthened, and thus grown the lasting possession of the 
sex. What in social life we call “custom” is nothing more 
than the habit-of-action of a large majority continued for 
several generations, :

Ir, now, we examine the various habits, we shall find that, 
according to our definition, there are as many different kinds 
as there are physical and mental functions. We might, perhaps, 
divide them into I. Physiologic dispositions and their com- 
bination in sensific parts of the nervous system; therefore, 
habits of action: (1) the senses, (2) the memory, (3) the 
intellect, the association of ideas, (4) the will as controller of 
the impressions. IJ. Dispositions and their combinations in 
motory centres, therefore, practices of voluntary and involun- 
tary motions. These could again be divided either according 
to the organs which they affected: (1) organs of speech, (2) 
arms, hands, and fingers, (3) legs and feet ;— or according to 
the centres in which they originated: (1) spinal cord, (2) 
brain, III. A union of both the truly mental (intellectual) 
and the motific functions (combination of sensitive with motory 
parts). Biran and Rosenkranz distinguish active and passive 
habits ; the former strengthen the spontaneity, the latter change 
the organism itself by impressions received, and bring it into 
accordance with them. To consider them all would carry us 
too far and beyond the limits set for this work, we dare not 
even here splinter our strength, and must try to economize. 
Therefore we will take up only those habits which are of special 
importance in actual education. ~

suppress its emotions; this inability education must do away 
with ; it should not be permitted to become permanent, as it 
has unfortunately done in many cases, as is eviriced by the

undisturbed. A strong and unexpected emotion lengthens — 
as has been shown by experiment — the time of reaction, that 
is, the duration of the nervous process which takes place 
between the reception of an impression and the reaction that 
follows it, by checking the activity of the will. It is the same 
phenomenon which, in a stronger degree, is characterized as 
terror. —~- Wund?. 
Exner, however, states that the time of reaction may be 
shortened by practice. The length of the apperception of 
complex impressions is greatly diminished by continued prac- 
tice. To prevent the ability to become active from degenerat- 
ing into officiousness it must be combined with modesty and 
humility.

Admonitions and reproofs often lose their aim by being too 
long, for the child in the meantime entertains other thoughts or 
picks up especial points against which it chances to be opposed, 
and in its mind delivers a speech of defence by which it is 
finally entirely convinced of its right. Lazarus mentions a case 
in which a father attempted to explain the outrage of its be- 
havior to a child that had been making a noise during its 
mother’s sickness. The child listened attentively to the long, 
well-set speech and at its end said to his father, “Say that 
again”; the sound of the speech had pleased the child, not- 
withstanding it had not understood anything of its import or taken 
it to heart at all, A similar result of lengthy speeches has often 
been noticed among uncivilized nations though the language 
was unintelligible to the hearers, yes, even if it had no log- 
ical sense. We shall find parallel to most observations in 
the nursery, in the mental life of uncultivated people, and the 
psychological studies made at both places are complementary.

It has been truly observed that Kant’s morals, by the rigid

and independence of the moral demands greatly advanced the 
training of men in Prussia, and thus assisted in the stern politi- 
cal regeneration of Germany. 
Hence the sense for propriety and a refined bearing should 
tarly be impressed upon the child. Although we can give the

reasons for its laws in general, this often can not’ be done with 
distinct cases. Though we do not place so much value on a 
refined bearing as Locke who aimed at the education of an 
aristocrat, though we would train the pupil rather to deep, 
clear, and precise thinking and energetic action, than form 
him into a society dandy or hollow talker, yet the ability oi 
never-lacking tact in our intercourse with various persons, and 
not offending by bad manners, is of some importance. We do 
not mean to say that the child should be invited to parties and 
soirees, and that it must forever be in the company of older 
persons. The former renders the child unaccustomed to hard 
work, lessens its pleasure in action, and permits a fondness for 
a mere life of pleasure to develop very early ; the latter makes 
the child precocious and spoils its pleasures of youth. Con- 
tinued supervision—as Herbart already showed—is not of 
much use. Companions and schoolmates during the time for 
recreation often have a better influence on the mental develop- 
ment of the child than the teachers with their steady admoni-

sought for by others as companion, whence he gradually adopts 
the good or evil qualities of the hermit, viz. patience, modesty, 
resignation, or sensitiveness, suspiciousness, pleasure at the 
misfortunes of others, etc. Even among grown persons the 
gteater or less ease of which they are conscious in their move- 
ments determines whether or not they feel at home in society, 
how far they will give up to it, or treat it with reserve, how 
much of what it offers they will receive, with what degree of 
pleasure they seek society, and, what is most important, what 
society this is. Luys connects the fineness of psychical feeling 
with the fineness of the skin and the touch-impressions thus 
received. It is well known that women in general, but partic- 
ularly those leading a life of leisure and not using their hands 
for rough work, have a fine, tender and sensitive skin ; the sen- 
sory nerves are more exposed and open to all external irritation. 
Touch and feeling are continually in a state of vibrating tension, 
and thus the mind receives numberless perceptions and touch- 
recognitions which usually remain entirely unnoticed by man. 
Hence in women of refined society, but also in men having a 
sensitive skin, the development and expression of mental abil- 
ities keeps step with the development and fineness of the sensi- 
bility of the skin. Fine feeling becomes almost a second sight, 
so that the mind feels and sees fine shades of difference which 
remain hidden from most men. On this is founded the im- 
portant moral feeling known as soul-feeling. With individuals 
of tender, éasily-irritated skin, whose sensorium like a drawn 
string is ready to begin vibrating on the slightest shock, it is 
characteristically developed. Compare with these the work- 
man who handles his heavy tools and bears burdens: with 
him the skin is thick, and between the network of sensory nerves 
and the bodies affecting them lie dense epithelial layers. 
Study the intellectual and moral sensibility here, and you will 
find that there is none of that delicate feeling which lends a 
peculiar character to the mental bearing of individuals with a 
e skin,

beginning the Child has no- active, but only passive attention, 
that is, in the rapid change of the manifold impressions and

first used and gradually transformed into active attention, which 
is able to choose among the impressions and received concep- 
tions, leave the strongest unnoticed at times, and firmly fix in 
its place a weaker conception, which has more or less connec- 
tion with others, or which, even without these connections, is 
required at the given moment. Waitz says: “The child origi- 
nally possesses no power by which it can give its train of thoughts 
a certain direction, retain it in such an one, or turn it away 
therefrom ; it is led on entirely by the external impressions on 
the one hand, and by the associations and reproductions, 
which are joined to a perception of external things and its 
bodily condition, on the other.” e her can _therefo

directed to this fixture, — that we may hope to save it from dis-

conceptions, to the depth and concentration of logical thoughts.

of pupils renders a continual direct instruction of each one 
impossible, the pupil should be accustomed to follow the 
indirect instruction with a lively attention, and thus collect the

tering, which we at least think to comprehend. The cele- 
brated pedagogue, T. Ziller, studied the importance of interest , 
very minutely, and declares that instruction must particularly’ 
awaken and develop a wide and many-sided interest in the 
objects taught and the mental labor, while the separate particles 
received may occasionally, without harm, fall a prey to forgetful-

    , be it physical or mental, and at present 
valued more or less highly in the world; but that idleness is 
not only the root of all evil, — for in “an idle way labors the evil 
spirit,’— but is besides unworthy of every man whom God 
endowed with a healthy body and mind. Spencer remarks: 
“The opinion that it is honorable to do nothing but seek 
pleasure, and in a certain sense dishonorable to spend life in 
providing others with the means of this pleasure, though con- 
siderably weakened, still holds ground.” He points to the fact 
that there is something low in being a mere consumer. But as 
the ideas of honor vary among different nations, and at different 
times, he thinks that “those of our contemporaries, who glory in 
consuming much, and producing nothing; and who concern 
themselves little about the welfare of their fellow-men so long 
as these provide them with good meals, soft beds, and pleasant 
* 4s, will be looked upon with amazement by people of 
mes, who live under higher social forms.” This change 
about honor is not only possible but very probable.

that they must be turned back, and the ladies submit to long

European nations. Now we see how members of the land- 
owning class enter into business; and even the sons of peers

teling that people of their position have public duties to

itely idle among them are considered blameworthy. “If 
xfinement of the ideas of honor is further developed, they 
Spencer thinks, “in future be amazed that there should 
ever have been persons who thought it admirable to enjoy with- 
out working, to the cost of those who work without enjoying.” 
Roscher says: ‘The higher culture rises the more honorable 
is labor, while barbaric nations despise it as slavish. And if 
every one would experience the delight of life, if he will prove 
the truth of the saying, ‘after ended labor we rest well,’ he 
must learn that labor is not only sweet, and may also turn very 
bitter; but that the joy at its completion is the highest and, 
according to the view of some, the ov/y sensual one which has 
no admixture of disgust.” ‘Epicureanism fails because it 
leaves important parts of man’s nature unpractised ; it neglects 
the satisfaction resulting from successful labor, and it lacks the 
gratifying consciousness of services done to others. Egotistical 
enjoyments, when continually searched, grow weak ; while the . 
desire for them is satiated in a much shorter time than our 
waking life gives us, thus leaving us times that are either empty 
or spent in efforts to attain enjoyment after the desire for it has 
ceased. They also grow weak from want of that broad contrast 
which arises when half of life is spent in active labor. The 
negative causes of dissatisfaction are connected with the positive 
cause alluded to,—the absence of that content won by successful 
labor, One of the most solid and lasting pleasures is the feeling 
of personal worth, which is continually refreshed in our con- 
sciousness by successful action; while an idle life is deprived 
in a great part of its hopes by the absence of this. Finally, the 
neglect of labor for others, or such labor as is felt to be in some 
way useful to others, brings with it the allied evils, —-a want of 
certain not easily drained positive enjoyments of the highest

kind and a further craving for egotistical pleasures which then 
again leads to satiety."—Volkmann. Spencer says: “He to 
whom life offers earnest work, interspersed with joyous holidays 
for recreation, will feel no ennui, and will not easily fall into 
pessimistic views or despair. The work should, . therefore, not 
be made too easy; it should not always be play for the child, 
although some weak parents may wish this, and some very 
respected pedagogues may attempt to set it up as a principle.” 
[Humanitarianism views study as a serious business. which 
“accustoms the apprentice by early vigorous action to diligence 
and industry.” Philanthropism wants to render study easy in 
every way so that the apprentice will take pleasure in the busi- 
ness, and thereby awaken and foster an inclination to work in 
him.] Industry should furthermore not be confined to too 
small a space, and practise certain psychical functions to the 
detriment of others which are neglected ; but it should strive 
after harmonic development of the entire man. It has been 
said, that at present a broad education.and a lively interest in 
various directions should early be implanted by instruction, as 
in consequence of the partition of labor, the later proiession 
requires a condensation ; and that the youth should already be 
introduced into the higher ideal world as preparation for a 
distinct vocation, the cares and worries of which leave little 
time for this after a while. But in order that this real mental 
interest may be awakened and fostered, the pupil should not 
be accustomed to learn and practise new things only, but to 
arrange what was formerly received, unite it with the present, 
and thereby gain new combinations as well as view clearly the 
connection of the separate parts with the whole. In this way, 
man is often first taught to recognize what corresponds best to 
his faculties, and towards which he must principally tum his 
power. 
Kern develops the following forms of instruction from the 
demands mentioned above. Instruction shall (1) arrange and
-P-A-G-E-83
SPECIAL HABITS.~ 75 
rectify the conceptional comparisons already belonging to the 
child ; (2) widen the circle of its conception by (a) creating 
new ideas, (4) forming new relations between those already 
present. From this follows, (1) the explanatory instruction, 
first of all, which must prepare the way for the later stages, 
and form.a basis forthem. It divides the ideas already existing 
into their separate parts, and renders them clearer. Herbart 
thinks it particularly meritorious, but very difficult for the 
teacher “to find the ‘entirely simple,’ and dissect his own 
thoughts into their elements,” and thus offer the child clear and 
comprehensible instruction. (2) The objective and developing 
instruction, 
., Amos Comenius required a flawless succession of instructions ; 
also Pestalozzi. The latter thinks we should begin with the 
easiest, and by successive progress add only a little to what has 
been fully learned. This produces confidence in the beginning 
of study, and keeps alive the consciousness of power, so that 
the children need only be guided, not driven. Like the house 
on a rock, the little new must be founded on what has formerly 
been acquired. The house, however, falls if the connection ~ 
between it and the rocks is moved but a few lines. Jacotot laid 
reat stress in his “ensignment universal” on the following : 
The representation of the new should be joined to what has 
been recognized, seen, comprehended ; one must learn to com- 
prehend one book, and then refer all that is read, heard, or 
learned to that ; and it will also be understood. 
A boy whose entire mental powers are developed and enlarged 
as much as possible under the same conditions, who is accus- 
tomed to compare all that he daily learns with what he knew 
the day before, and watch whether this comparison will not 
cause him to discover things which had not been told him; 
who is continually led to look from one science into another ; 
who is taught to rise as easily from the special to the general 
as to descend again from the general to the special —- that boy

will grow to be a genius, or we cannot grow to be anything in 
this world. Plato remarked that the discovery of new rela- 
tions between what has been acquired characterized the truly 
philosophic faculty, and enabled one to comprehend the gen- 
eral, eternal ideas, In these cases the habitude of concen- 
tration and a broad education can well proceed along side of 
each other. 
In the development of the mental powers, the school should 
not neglect the body, but should foster separate and fine’ 
motific functions during the hours for general instruction, and 
complex and stronger ones outside of these periods. As the 
child practises and strengthens certain muscle-groups by crawl- 
ing and walking, gymnastics will strengthen the whole organ- 
ism. In connection with this, gymnastic excursions and gen- 
eral games as well as private walks of single students, will

limbs and physical grace in general are greatly favored, which

so highly as an important factor in the education of xaAoyé-yabia ; 
and Jahn told his contemporaries that gymnastics was a “ matter 
concerning all mankind, which belonged everywhere, where 
mortal man inhabited the world,” just as Fichte calls it a vital 
part of education. 
As far as the hours of instruction are concerned, the organs 
of speech are practised in a natural and manifold way in speak- 
ing, reading, and singing; the hand, in writing and drawing; 
and the fingers, in playing on instruments, and in needlework. 
With writing and drawing may be combined a continuance of 
the habitude for cleanliness and neatness, while the eesthetic 
sense for regularity and beauty must be awakened and fostered.

Before its entrance into school the child has been accustomed 
to articulate the sounds of its mother tongue correctly, and to 
use them correctly ; the school must continue this practice, and 
complete the verbal instruction in language by written applica- 
tions. 
Rousseau opposes the too early persuasion of children to 
speak. He thinks the gveazes¢ harm caused by a hasty attempt 
to make children speak, zs mo¢, that our conversations and 
words have no meaning whatever for them, but that they con- 
nect an entirely different meaning with them without our know- 
ing it. This generally produces the surprises which speeches 
of children cause us, by our giving to them a meaning which 
the children had not at all connected with them. Lazarus 
points to the fact that it is specially harmful if the child from 
. the first hears two languages and speaks them itself, for it can- 
not then enter deeply enough into either. The higher instruc- 
tion must proceed in the same way with the study of foreign 
languages ; the rules of grammar are not only to be studied 
but their use taught and practised by verbal and written exer- 
cises. In arithmetic habitude should make the use of the 
multiplication table, and the advantages of some operations in 
higher mathematics, the appliance of some particular rules in 
complicated, proofs, a “second nature.” As elementary geom- 
etry, by the comprehension and construction of the elements 
of space, at first practises the observing powers of the child, so 
the natural sciences must primarily give to the soul of the child 
clear impressions of natural bodies ; afterwards the instruction in 
natural science should lead by comparison, discrimination, and 
abstraction to the deduction of natural laws from separate phe- 
nomena. Geography no less than natural science should begin 
with what is most familiar, and proceed to what is foreign and 
less known. But the place most familiar to the child is its 
home. On the one hand, the paternal house, with the apple- 
tree in the garden on which the finches sing, is the first ground
-P-A-G-E-86
78. HABIT IN- EDUCATION. 
to the environs of which man is bound with bonds of steel, and 
from which the wider affinities of the family, the community, 
the race, extend to form by a close union of bonds, the great 
whole, the nation. On the other hand, as Kern well says: “In 
the mental life of the boy his home forms the standard by 
which he measures foreign places. He compares the size of 
other cities with the size of his native city or those lying near his 
native home. His ideas of rivers and seas are formed after the 
streams and ponds of his native land; he places the hills and 
mountains of his immediate surroundings in thought, one upon 
the other, to picture to himself the mountains of foreign lands. 
A winter landscape gives him the first sketch for the picture he 
makes of the Polar regions. Zhe general geographical ideas are 
not gained by explanations such as are collected in the introduc- 
tions to geographical hand-books, but by abstractions from the 
separate ideas and conceptions that he has gained by immediate 
observation. The boy will understand a map only when he 
has previously been taught to recognize the points in a carto- 
graphic representation of what he has actually seen.” Lazarus 
would, therefore, like to see four maps in every school. 1. A 
plan of the village or city; 2. the county; 3. the state or 
country ; 4. the grand division of the earth. The child should 
hunt in the first plan the street, perhaps even the house in - 
which it lives, in order to accustom itself to the cartographic 
representation. “Then,” says Lazarus, “it should familiarize 
itself with the idea that on the second map, the street can no 
longer be seen, and the city is only marked by a large, and in the 
third, by a very small circle, and disappears entirely from the 
last where the whole state takes up but a very small part. The 
pupil should also learn that the cities, countries, and nations, 
even the grand divisions and their inhabitants, are no longer 
isolated but connected with each other by commerce, so that 
the products of a European state are consumed in America, 
India, or China; and vice versa, he should furthermore gain
-P-A-G-E-87

some knowledge of the relations of private property, grounds and 
houses ; to state property, roads, and land, and water-ways, etc.” 
Instruction in history, like that in religion, has the special 
purpose of assisting in the education of the feelings, as it awak- 
ens and fosters the sense for the high and ideal as well as for 
the moral feelings. Ancient history, by the number of sublime 
examples, by the simplicity and transparency of its relations, 
which have so often been held up to view, offers the best oppor- 
tunity for this. But the pupil must even here accustom himself 
to study, that he may gain insight by inculcation and frequent 
repetition ; only by a mastery of the material will he gain an 
insight into the connection of a separate event with a larger 
period, and into the relationship of this period to the whole pre- 
vious development.; thus he will recognize in how many ways 
and in which directions humanity has progressed, on what the 
present state of culture of his country and all the inhabitants 
of earth is based, and he will then be able later to form a con- 
ception of what its purpose and use really are. The influence 
of great examples in historical instruction was especially dwelt 
on by Montaigne. Herbert Spencer thinks that history, as now 
taught, has only a conventional, that is, no actual, value, as it 
amounts to a mere accumulation, in the memory, of numbers 
and dead facts from which no principles for the guidance of 
actions at the present time could be deducted. He demands 
in its place a “ Natural History of Society,” that is, a mention 
of all those facts which help us to understand the growth and 
organization process of a nation. He would have taught de- 
velopment, combination, principles, methods, prejudices, or vices 
of the government; formation of the church rule, its actions 
and omissions as well as its relations to the state ; a synopsis of 
.the commercial system ; state of esthetic culture as evinced by 
architecture, painting, etc. The child should be taught that 
these are members of a whole, and how the different phases of 
tulture blend one into the other. This descriptive sociology
-P-A-G-E-88
80 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
should be based on psychology, as it is made up of the actions 
of separate beings, and can be understood only by the aid of 
psychology. . Lazarus draws attention to the fact that formerly 
historical instruction included only a history of wars and bat- 
tles, but that in the lately opened path we have been obliged to 
go farther, and give more history of the mental culture. 
Spencer and Bain especially write against the linguistic- 
humanistic education of the present time ; they would introduce 
in its place a scientific education, because it is of more use in 
practical life. Spencer says that grammar is the philosophy of 
language, and therefore, as it consists of the abstract, should be 
taught Zas¢ instead of first, — proceeding from the general prin- 
ciple that the concrete should be taught first, and then the 
abstract.. Spencer and Wyse would not begin in mathematics 
with the general abstractions of lines and surfaces, but produce 
them for observation in real objects containing surfaces and lines ; 
then have them copied, and so on,

CONNECTION BETWEEN INTELLECT AND EMOTION. — LYING. 
As both school and life should make morality so much of a. 
habitude and second nature that in single actions no struggle, 
not even a thought of what is to be done, will be necessary, but 
that man will immediately do the right and good thing, so 
school instruction, particularly in the intellectual direction, 
should habituate to “thinking and speaking” by producing 
clearness and plainness, decision and firmness, order and cohe- 
rence in all mental operations. The sense of truth grown into 
a habit, and the habitual practice of a thorough method of 
observation and judgment, form the only true and developed 
theoretical education. 
Bad habits injure as much as good ones benefit, Education 
should, therefore, combine the positive acquirement of good 
habits and the negative work of not practising bad habits, and 
prevent the spoiling of the child by not permitting its wishes 
and wants to be fulfilled the moment they are expressed. 
The child should be weaned of all bad peculiarities, pas- 
sions, and emotions, —laziness, inactivity, fickleness, and weak- 
ness of will, quarrelsomeness, and selfishness, vanity, obstinacy, 
and wilfulness, anger, and revengefulness. [E. M. Arndt 
places perverseness almost out of the sphere of imputability, 
by looking upon it as an inborn ailment, resulting from the 
unfortunate disposition of the parents, or conventional mar- 
riages without love.] This can best be done by removing the 
causes and incentives; the more rarely evil traits find an 
opportunity of appearing and gaining strength, the more they
-P-A-G-E-90
82 HABIT IN EDUCATION, 
will lose in power, just as physical powers grow weaker when 
they are not practised. Where the removal of the incentives 
or the setting aside of all opportunities for its expression is 
impossible, a diversion of the attention of the child to more 
harmless objects, especially games, will often be very beneficial. 
In later years a bad inclination is conquered more easily by 
the introduction of an opposing stronger passion than by mere 
instruction ; for, though we can refute and conquer thoughts 
by thoughts, they are powerless against feelings as well as 
against the education of the energy of personal will. It is, 
however, an exaggeration when Herbert Spencer says: “He 
who would hope to give a knowledge of geometry by lessons 
in Latin, or expect to gain practice in drawing by the expres-_ 
sive playing of a sonata, would be considered ready for a lunatic 
asylum ; and yet he would scarcely be more irrational than 
those who hope to engender better feelings by schooling the 
mental faculties.” Three psychical foundation processes, 
formerly called “ soul-powers,”” — thinking, feeling, will, —con- 
tinually influence each other; as the feelings and interest, the 
wishes and inclinations, exercise their effect on the will and 
thoughts, so the education of the intelligence is of vast impor- 
tance for the emotional life. The finer zsthetic moral and 
religious feelings are only possible with a high development of 
ideas. 
The fostering of a sense af honor and shame may here sup- 
presS many evil inclinations} Many qualities which we do not 
approve have been produced by a former false education, and 
can easily be removed by avoiding the mistakes of this false 
method, taking the influences on the organism of nature, the 
season and time of day, the individual natural disposition, and 
momentary state of the pupil, into consideration, and making 
our preparations and rules of conduct accordingly. Further- 
more, we should attempt to keep up the good humor of the 
pupil during every occupation, and to produce a pleasant
-P-A-G-E-91
MORAL HABITS. 83 
change between exertion and recreation during the lesson, 
between absorption and recollection. In the upper classes of 
high institutions the pupils must often be broken of the habits 
of card-playing, and other student-like bearing and actions, 
with great severity. The fiercest and most obstinate fight, how- 
ever, which education has to carry on is that against lying, from 
earliest childhood to the upper classes of gymnasiums and real- 
schools, Waitz speaks of the evil psychological results of the suc- 
cessful lie: “If, in consequence of the transgression of a com- 
mand, conscience has been awakened, it will be almost entirely 
silenced by the successful lie, for the transgression seems 
obviated thereby, as it has become invisible. Herein is the 
great danger of the lie: it permits the transgression, which it 
withdrew from discovery, to appear less great and important, 
as the feared results thereof are now happily turned away, and 
in this way it dulls the conscience in general.” The pupil 
should here be made occasionally to feel, with great sever- 
ity, the severe consequences of lying, beside the reprimand- 
ing words about the disgrace of it. Basedow thought lying 
should be caused to result in misfortune to the children them- 
selves, that by this misfortune they may be diverted therefrom ; 
they should also be accustomed not to feel ashamed of the 
confession. With half-grown boys and young men, however, 
who are not habitual liars, it will have a very good effect to teach 
them to look upon a lie as something terrible, by evidences of 
confidence, and in this way to brand it silently as dishonorable 
cowardice, and deserving of shame. Most lies are not the 
result of an inclination thereto, or of natural villany, but of 
the effort to withdraw from a momentary difficulty ; they are 
used by children to avoid smaller or larger punishments, with- 
out their valuing the truth in the same way in which we must. 
They look upon language as a supply of means to reach their 
purpose. But what we should see to is, that when questioned 
about what took place, they tell the truth.
-P-A-G-E-92
84 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
Jean Paul is not far wrong when he says: “In the first five 
years our children say no true word and no lying one; they 
only talk. Their speaking is a loud thinking; but as often 
one-half of a thought is yes, and the other no, and they (un- 
like us) utter both, they appear to lie, while they only speak to 
themselves. Furthermore, they enjoy playing with the art of 
speech new to them; thus they often speak nonsense, only to 
listen to their own knowledge of language.” Children give 
their imaginative ideas a reality, and do not know how to dis- 
tinguish subjective thinking and objective reality; they are 
involuntary poets. Ruegg says: “Already in the second year 
of life—- more frequently in later ones—the child will drink 
comfortably from an empty cup, eat out of an empty dish, and 
gladly share these meals with those around him. It can feed 
birds which are not present, and not even represented by any- 
thing, and it will often grow excited, and sad, or angry, when 
some one walks over the place and drives the imagined birds 
away.” These phenomena of child-life are also found among 
uncultivated barbaric races Tyler tells of a woman in Van 
Diemen’s Land who addressed four or five stones as though 
they were her distant relatives. 
The imaginative conceptions of children appear particularly 
in their play, and there receive the privileges of reality. A boot- 
jack, a foot-stool, becomes a horse on which the child rides, a 
doll which it sings to sleep. If, therefore, there is in their play 
acertain danger, the inability to distinguish subjective and ob- 
jective facts, which actual life must remove, this is, nevertheless, 
of pedagogical importance in forming the imagination and 
changing passive imagination, which devotes itself more to 
the impressions received from without and the change of the 
encited ideas, into active imagination, which creates these 
conceptions itself, and makes a selection between those offer- 
ing themselves. If the playthings of children are, however, to 
accomplish this latter object, they should not consist, as is
-P-A-G-E-93
RN, 
a MORAL HABITS. 85 
mostly the case at present, of already finished copies of real 
forms and objects, which leave no room for the imagination 5 
but they should contain rough pieces of wood, building-blocks, 
etc,, which the child must form into something, either imitat- 
ing objects it has seen, or inventing new ones, and thus exer- 
cising his imagination. We may, indeed, often observe that 
the child will much rather play with the old, roughly-fashioned 
horse and the shapeless doll, than with elegant new toys, which 
are very similar to the real objects they represent; it can 
make something out of the former, but not out of the latter. 
Furthermore, the plays of children should not be systematized ; 
they should give the individual an opportunity for the distinct 
development of its fancy. 
Rousseau also shows that the mania children sometimes have 
for destroying things does not arise from ill temper, but from 
the lively desire for action, the wish to change the condition of 
things ; they sometimes break their toys in consequence of a 
craving of their imagination to see what is in or behind them. 
Neither do they lie from natural badness, but allow themselves 
to be carried away by the interest of their story, and give a 
reality to suddenly arising conceptions, and thus mingle truth 
and fiction, Jean Paul tells of a girl who often pictured visions 
of the Christ-child to him, and told him what it had done and 
said, while when directly questioned, the girl always spoke the 
truth, Iwas myself told by a lady who now writes very good 
poems, and therefore possesses a lively imagination, that when 
a child she related stories to her friends and relatives, which she 
said were dreams of the preceding night, the separate ideas of 
which, however, did not appear until she began to relate them. 
This was not a wicked propensity “ to bind up upon others,” but 
the pleasure in relating and “composing.” And there may be 
many such young poetesses ; girls have many small stratagems 
at their command, and are especially strong in “ fibbing.” Such 
things should not be condemned as ill-natured lies, but neither
-P-A-G-E-94
56 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
should they be smiled at and permitted to reach their purpose ; 
boasting and exaggerations by children should be met with 
solemn silence. Especially the parents themselves and others 
about the child should not accustom it to lying by making use of 
social lies. Education should not treat this fancying habit of 
children too severely as a lie, but gradually break them of it.

Enucation should also prevent the spoiling of children. No 
one should be accustomed too much, still less entirely, to the 
use of one function, so that the ability to perform it will not 
grow into a necessity and the power of free personal decision 
will not be lost, and it will not be difficult to change or modify 
it as soon as circumstances should require this. In this regard, 
if for habitude we make use of its extreme degree, Rousseau is 
not far wrong when he says: “The only habit which a child 
should be permitted to acquire is this, that it habituate itself to 
nothing in particular.” “We should not carry it oftener on one 
arm than on the other; not accustom it to give one hand in 
preference to the other or use it oftener; always to eat, sleep, 
and be active at the same hour, or to be able to remain alone 
neither by day nor night. Help the child from afar to assume 
the rule of personal liberty and, the use of its power by leaving 
its natural habits to the body, by bringing the child to be always 
master of itself and always to follow only its own will as soon as 
it shall have one.” But this too close accustoming to one habit 
is particularly hurtful to the emotional life. It is true, as Rous- 
seau and many others have likewise taught, that in educational 
matters one age shall not be sacrificed to a following one, nor 
its pleasures curtailed, but each should keep its joy, and the
-P-A-G-E-96
88 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
child should retain cheerfulness and joy in life and labor not- 
withstanding all exertion. Lazarus therefore looks upon every 
labor imposed as a punishment, as a pedagogical mistake, since 
it spoils the child’s pleasure in work in general. Every act of 
the pedagogue should be not only a means for the better ac- 
complishment of the following one, nor alone self-sufficient, but 
both together. The child should be given time for recreation 
and play, free choice in the variety of the latter, and by this 
means its pleasure in play. Lazarus here shows a fault of the 
kindergarten system, which otherwise has so many good points. 
It does not let the child have a free choice of the play, but 
forces it to join in, though it be only by a stern glance. The 
adult should mix as little as possible with the play of the child, 
and leave it mostly.to its own resources and ideas. But it 
should not be accustomed too much to material enjoyments, 
that is, spoiled. It should find appreciation for good work, but 
it should not be rewarded by sensual joys, or compensated for 
every exertion; it should learn by-and-by to look upon the 
feeling of satisfaction which follows every labor that has been 
well done, as the best and only reward. Not until education 
has found an opportunity of drawing the pupil’s attention to 
his better self by deeply impressive approval (not exactly 
praise) will it work well. Censure will not find willing ears 
until it has ceased to stand alone as a minus quantity; let it 
threaten to demolish, in part, approval already gained, and the 
effect will be much greater. ‘Thus, he only will feel the pres- 
sure of self-reproach who has gained some self-respect, and is 
afraid of losing it. The pupil who is only censured will grow 
ill-humored when the teacher will not take him as he is. Fen- 
elon, the tutor of the princes of France, only succeeded in 
curing his princely pupil of his ugly traits by not withholding 
approval of his good qualities, and encouraging him in their 
exercise. Fenelon justly observed that the tutor should attempt 
less to gain the fear than the love of his pupils, as man will
-P-A-G-E-97
EXTREME HABITUATION. 89 
easily adopt the manners and thoughts of those he loves. 
Time devoted to play should not be offered too often and in 
too large quantities. Herbart says it requires but little to 
please children in various ways when great temperance is the 
daily habit, and Lazarus truly remarks: “ Man should be accus- 
tomed to enjoyment of life, but not to a life of enjoyment.” 
The spoiling of a child by frequent, unnecessary pleasures, by 
artificial enjoyments which do not include somewhat of labor 
and practice, is detrimental, because the dulness of sensitive 
feeling which is engendered thereby does away with many 
small aids to discipline, which can be used with good result by 
children not thus spoiled. Very early the crying of children 
should not be hushed every time by all sorts of quieting meas- 
ures and small pleasures, only that the mother and all others 
present may not be disturbed. Rousseau says: “So long as 
the child cries I do not go to it at all, but I return to it the 
moment it ceases. Soon it will call me by being quiet, or per- 
haps uttering only a single cry.” Children determine the mean- 
ing of their cries by their visible effects; they have no other 
test. A child will rarely cry if it is alone, no matter how 
severely it has hurt itself, unless it hopes to be heard. If the 
child sees that we are greatly worried about it, and console and 
pity it, it will deem itself lost; but if we make no great 
ado about it, it-will soon forget the pain. Wilfulness is often 
trained into older-children by granting that which should be 
denied, through weakness, or a desire to have rest from the 
pleadings of the child. 
Thus have we arrived at the last stage of our investigation, 
which concerns the injuriousness of habituation when carried 
to the extreme. We saw that not only bad habits, but all 
which were carried to the extreme, have an injurious effect, 
especially on the emotions. This latter point we will look at a 
little closer. 
Feeling is “the manner in which consciousness or self-con-
-P-A-G-E-98
go HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
sciousness every moment reacts on what is taking place within.” 
The conception itself always expresses only the immediate 
reciprocal effect of a connection of consciousness with the 
external world. The emotions, however, picture the manner 
in which the consciousness, by reason of its entire condition, 
its lasting and momentary inclinations, receives the reciprocal 
effect. . . . Wundleband says: “ Every conception is in a cer- 
tain relation to the whole psychical system in which it appears, 
and this relation is expressed in the accompanying emotion. 
We can, in general, distinguish three theories concerning the 
emotions, among which there are, however, manifold connec- 
tions and mediations: 1. The emotions are a special action 
of the faculty of perception, a dark perceptive power. 2. The 
emotions proceed from a reciprocal action of the conceptions. 
3- The emotions are the condition in which the soul is placed 
by its conceptions and perceptions.” This view is very ancient, 
and can be found expressed in the old theory of the soul’s pow- 
ers. A distinct peculiarity of emotional life is that it continu- 
ally vibrates between the opposites of pleasure and displeasure, 
and is heightened in intensity by the contrast. A person who 
has been sick feels more comfort on the return of his health 
than one who rejoices in steady good health. Preceding sor- 
row causes joy, and vice versa, former happiness, present mis- 
fortune, and pain, to be felt far more keenly. The hatred 
which develops from the change of former love is the most 
severe. Campe explains the phenomena, that things which 
formerly impressed us with decided displeasure, then grew 
bearable and indifferent, finally even pleasant, or, that what was 
formerly pleasant may gradually have an unpleasant effect, 
because the contrast, which was very strong in the beginning, 
grows weaker after some time. As an example of the former 
case he mentions that. galley-slaves do not feel their terrible fate 
as much after ten years as on the first day, and in proof of: the 
latter he cites Shakespeare’s,.“ If the entire year consisted of
-P-A-G-E-99
EXTREME HABITUATION. gt 
holy play-days, celebrations would be as noxious as labor.” 
Pleasures, of whatever kind, are subject to the motto, “ variatio 
delectat.” Sensual, as well as higher emotions, require a change, 
if they shall continue in their original strength. If this change 
is not offered, the reaction of consciousness on the inner action, 
the emotion, will grow weaker in proportion to the frequency of 
its repetition in a similar manner; and will finally change to 
the exact opposite ; we lose the interest in things which always 
bring us the same impressions ; they grow indifferent, tiresome, 
and finally excite disgust and repugnance ; the highest joy and 
the strongest passion are weakened by time, and we gradually 
grow accustomed to the pain which was at first very severe. 
The pedagogue must bear this fact in mind. The pupil 
should be granted a change, not only from exertion to recrea- 
tion, “concentration and recollection,” but also in the manner 
of his recreation and play as well as the mode of his exertion. 
The time devoted to a certain subject of instruction, a single 
work, cannot be abnormally lengthened. The pupil should not 
do now this, now that, and thus weaken his powers, but neither 
should the instruction and the repetition be made tiresome to 
him ; his interest must be continually kept alive by an illumi- 
nation of different points of the same subject. “To be tire- 
some is the greatest crime of the instructor.” 
Every conception has, so to say, a maximum of clearness for 
each separate person; if we attempt to retain it in conscious- 
ness long after it has reached this point, we. must use great 
exertion, and may not succeed after all. On the contrary, a 
condition will be produced which permits just those concep- 
tions contrasting to the former ones to arise. _— 
The same is shown in the mental life of nations and man- 
kind. When an idea has reached the highest point of its 
power, and rules the separate minds, taking up a great deal of 
their attention, the antithetical one will gradually appear, grow 
in strength and develop its greatest power when the first has
-P-A-G-E-100
g2 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
decayed and outlived itself. In after ages it may again appear. 
K. Schmid, in speaking of the difference between modern 
enlightenment and that of former times, remarks: “ One ex- 
treme calls forth the other. ‘The religious mental powers draw 
too firmly and too much in the same direction during the 
period of the abstract theological view of the world and educa- 
tion ; they awaken the similarly one-sided thinking powers, and 
these now assume the judgment-seat to inquire how they may 
be justified by the former existence of science, and what has 
been historically developed, and is actually present in general. 
The mind criticises the existing religion, and before this criti- 
cism the positive truths of the latter are dissolved into general 
intellectual expressions,” 
Habit dulls the feeling for rewards, and still mote 2 that for 
punishments ; the teacher should therefore see that he does 
not use too strict measures in the beginning, but according to 
circumstances, make use of admonitions, threats, and mild 
reproofs, and only when these are of no avail employ sterner 
punishments to insure a gradation to himself. Waitz says: 
“We should never use a stronger measure when we can get 
along with a weaker one.” But he advises severe measures 
from the beginning when it is intended to obviate the bad 
results of a former too lenient training. : 
Physical punishments were particularly in vogue before the 
Reformation. Thomas Platter; in his autobiography, gives a 
sad description of this fact. Even some time after the Refor- 
mation the motto “He who loves his child should punish it” 
was generally followed. In the last century, when the philan- 
thropists who received their name from their desire to make 
instruction easy for the pupils, arose, the schoolmaster Hauberle 
in a small city of Swabia made a note of the punishments he 
had inflicted during an activity of 52 years. He-gave 911,527 
strokes with a cane, 124,010 cuts with a rattan, 20,989 cuts on 
fingers and hands with the ruler, 136,715 strokes with his hand,
-P-A-G-E-101
EXTREME HABITUATION. 93 
10,235 strokes on the mouth, 7,905 boxes on the ear, 1,115,800 
punches of the head, and 22,763 extras with Bible, catechism, 
hymn-book, and grammar ; 777 times he had boys kneel on peas, 
and 613 times on three-cornered pieces of wood ; 5,001 had to 
wear the dunce-cap, and 1,707 hold up the rattan; 800,000 of 
the cuts with the cane were given for Latin vocables, and 76,000 
of the rattan strokes for biblical texts and verses from the 
hymnal. He made use of about 3,000 invectives and words of 
abuse, of which his native tongue supplied about two-thirds, and 
one-third were due to his own invention. On the other hand, 
we have the words of “ Walther von der Wogelweide,” “ No one 
can train the child with the rod”; and Amos Comenius’s 
remark, “Blows and strokes have not the power to bring love 
for the sciences into the heads of children, but may often cause 
a disgust for them.” Bain says: “Pain is a waste of brain 
power, while the work of the student requires the highest form 
of this power. Whatever the punishment accomplishes is at 
the cost of a great loss of power, which loss increases when the 
punisliment is looked. upon with actual fear. Every one has 
perhaps met with cases in which a pupil was rendered wholly 
unfit to finish the given work by fear.” 
The moral feeling, the conscience, is often like the emotions 
and the feelings of honor weakened by habit, as the latter 
causes greater negligence in the examination of motives. The 
higher esthetic feeling needs change. Works of art must be 
viewed from various points, if the enjoyment of them is to 
remain the same, Religious instruction is destined to 
offer man the highest things and touch the mind in all its 
depths: to gain this the teacher should take into consideration 
not only the influence of the hours of the day, and the disposi- 
tion of the pupil, and therefore choose a proper time when the 
mental functions have not grown weary by many preceding 
hours of study; but the hours of instruction should not occur 
too frequently. The instruction in religion should compare to
-P-A-G-E-102
94 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
the other lessons as Sunday to the week days. Teacher and 
pupil must approach it with a solemn feeling. The feeling of 
solemnity and elevation can, however, at least with children, 
only be deep and continue in the same intensity for some time, 
when its repetition does not take place too often. Nothing can 
affect us with solemnity which has in any way become a habit ; 
not every day can be a Sabbath; only the unusual retains the 
power of taking entire possession of the soul. Lessing says in 
one of his works: “Only that will impress us as miraculous, a 
conception of which appears but rarely in the chain of our 
ideas. Ona diligent student of the Bible the greatest miracle 
which is described in the Scriptures will no longer make the 
same impression as it did the first time he heard or read it. ... 
The miracle remains the same, but our frame of mind changes 
when we think it over too often.” This is not contradictory to 
what has been said before: the adult will find the more sup- 
ports for his religious belief, the oftener he has experienced the 
love, wisdom, and omnipotence of his Creator in his own life. 
The new physiologic-psychology has shown the importance of 
the so-called psycho-physical law. ‘This shows that the strength 
of the emotion does not increase in the same measure as the 
external irritation, but that mathematically expressed, the emo- 
tions grow like the logarithms when the irritations increase in 
their intensity like the figures, or that the emotion grows like 
the logarithm of the irritation, This law is of great importance 
not only for the impressions of the senses, but also for the 
emotions and the will. Already in the last century, Daniel 
Bernouille and Laplace remarked that the inner feeling of hap- 
piness, which Laplace calls “fortune morale,” is proportional 
to the logarithm of external possessions, “fortune physique,” 
or in other words, that the satisfaction grows in arithmetical 
progression, when the possession is increased in geometrical 
progression ; viz., a man who owns $1,000 and gains $100 
more has the same feeling of satisfaction which another wha
-P-A-G-E-103
EE 
Le 
NR a 
an ea EXTREME HABITUATION. 95 
owns only $100 and gains $10 more, feels. If this feeling is 
not retained by a corresponding increase in the same intensity, 
or strengthened, a craving for it will grow to a strong power and 
seek satisfaction. In the same way in which this is the case 
with the external material possessions it will also happen with 
ambition, the mental possession we have in the souls of others 
(the “enlarging of self-confidence in and through others”). 
The craving for honor and renown grows in increasing degrees 
the more man has already accomplished. 
In the description of characters such as Napoleon I., too 
little regard is often paid to the fact that these phenomena are 
based on a psychological law. A man who rose so high must 
find it. difficult, even impossible, to control the unmeas- 
ured growth of the craving for honor and ambition. In the 
same way, his contempt of mankind which is so often mentioned, 
is explained to a large degree by his descent, his disposition as 
a cold and abstract-thinking mathematician ; furthermore, by 
the time of his rising, the French Revolution; and finally, by 
his whole life, which, on innumerable battle-fields, hardened 
him, and rendered him insensible to the sufferings of man, 
Even Spencer, although he particularly says that the emotions 
and hate prevent correct judgment, and gives a chapter the 
special heading “The Prejudices of Patriotism,” does not 
seem to be free from such prejudices when he pictures Napo- 
leon I, as dark as he does in his “Introduction to the Study 
of Sociology.” 
Doubtless these phenomena deserve the attention of the 
pedagogue. The wishes of the pupils are to be turned aside 
in many ways, and diversion should be offered them by a change 
of the conceptions, so that the desire bound to a narrow space. 
will not grow with too great rapidity. Kem says: “ Every 
conception may be followed by a desire. The more change 
there is in the world of ideas, the more will one desire supplant 
another ; the more the circle of thoughts is widened, the larger
-P-A-G-E-104
96 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
also will be the range of desire; and the oftener a certain 
desire returns, the more foundation will the idea with which it 
is connected gain, and the stronger will it therefore grow. If 
it is not suppressed by another desire or by conceptions which 
are more powerful than those on which it depends, it will not 
cease until it has been satisfied.” 
The child should, therefore, not be spoiled by material enjoy- 
ments, because his wishes widen and grow in the same propor- 
tion in which they are satisfied. The better pupils should 
early be protected against immeasurable ambition and egotism. 
As oft-repeated desires and strong passions grow to an immense 
Strength, and can, as is well known, “ put things éz/ man’s 
head,” so the conceptions connected with them will grow to 
“fixed ideas” which continually increase in possession of the 
domain of consciousness, and finally lead to complete insanity. 
Aside from these pathological phenomena every extreme 
habituation has a very harmful influence on the intellectual life 
by narrowing the circle of conceptions, allowing man to grow 
rusty in the old relations and views, and making a pedant of 
him. Firm, rigid lines are formed wherever a small number 
of conceptions return uniformly in greater degrees of clearness. 
Hence arises that stiff pedantry which threatens schoolmen, 
chancery clerks, etc., especially when aided by the melancholy 
or phlegmatic temperament found here quite as often as it is 
rare among artists and practitioners of every kind, whose 
vocations press them on to ever-new combinations. Women 
are less liable to pedantry than men. 
The union of the conceptions of words, and the designations 
of objects, is especially close, so that to many it seems identical. 
For those who know only their mother tongue it must seem 
almost incomprehensible how the object which is not only 
called bread, but actually 7s bread, can be called differently in 
another language. The habits of thought, which otherwise, as 
attifices, are of great advantage to the rapidity of the intellectual
-P-A-G-E-105
EXTREME HABITUATION. 97 
functions, can also lead to extreme one-sidedness and cause 
manifold disappointments. Thus the mathematician will some- 
times treat everything after the method of his science. “In 
handling questions that the concrete sciences offer, he recog- 
nizes only a few of the factors, quietly gives these a positiveness 
which they do not possess, and proceeds in a mathematical way 
by drawing positive decisions from these premises as though 
they were specific and sufficient.” — Herbert Spencer. 
He who never left his native home, who never had an op- 
portunity of recognizing “many men’s minds,” remains bound 
in the conceptional range of his parents and ancestors. Among 
the higher classes the views concerning social rank which 
are developed by inheritance, education, condition, and habit, 
grow to rank-prejudices if the pupil is not early enough ac- 
quainted with a wider outlook. Not only instruction, but even 
stern measures of discipline, are sometimes needed to conquer 
such rank-prejudices. Bain investigates the “Law of Rel- 
ativeness,” which is of value to the emotions (effect of contrast) 
as well as to the mind, and the most distinct characteristic 
feature of which is the dependence of the intensity of conscious- 
ness on the grade of transitions from one impression to another. 
While Hobbs remarks, “It is a/mos¢ immaterial to a person 
whether he always perceives the same object or nothing,” Bain 
thinks he should have said whody, for it is a well-known fact 
that an unchanged impression on our senses, if lasting any length 
of time, has the same influence as none at all. ‘A change of the 
impression,” he says, “is necessary if we shall grow’ conscious 
of it.” The feeling of heat is no absolute, independent, self- 
subsisting condition of the mind, but the consequence of a 
transition from cold; the perception of light is dependent on a 
transition from darkness or shade into light. To use a common 
example, a watch-maker is not conscious of the uninterrupted 
ticking of his watches ; but if they suddenly all stopped, he would 
become aware of the pause. In exertions of mind and body
-P-A-G-E-106
98 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
the ability is greatest immediately after the condition of rest. 
The power is at its height when the renewed nerves start afresh, 
and sinks the more we approach the point of exhaustion. 
From this hypothesis we may picture to ourselves that, when 
all the parts of the brain are in perfect equilibrium and constantly 
remain on the same height, when none begin to grow stronger 
or weaker, consciousness or feeling will be zero, the mind will be 
at rest. A disturbance of this condition awakens consciousness 
for a time; a further interruption gives it a new impulse, and so 
on: besides, the variety of the impressions influencing the mind 
in a waking condition will prevent perfect equilibrium from 
again taking place. In unison with this is the nature of the 
mind, so rich in changes; the line of consciousness may be 
more easily likened to a series of explosions than a quiet, steady 
stream. The fact that we generally retain the impression of 
rest is only due to the excitement’s being so unimportant and 
temperate ; as soon as the intensity of feeling increases, the ex- 
plosive character becomes very prominent. 
The mind begins to work by distinguishing. The conscious- 
ness of difference is the beginning of every mental activity. Zo 
receive a new impression ts to notice changes. Man has a power 
of distinguishing more or less fineness in sight, sounds, smell, 
taste, and touch impressions. Here is the deepest cause of the 
inequality in intellectual powers, as well as the variety in the 
directions of taste. The fineness and tenderness in the feeling 
of difference is the measure for the variety and number of our 
first impressions, and therefore of our treasured memories. A 
too long continuation of the same impression is followed by a 
weakening of consciousness; and monotony, as is well known, 
has a stupefying effect. Everything new and strange will awaken 
our attention and our interest more than the habitual impres- 
sions which we received from the old accustomed conditions ; 
the logical thinking-power and energy are hereby challenged to 
activity and fired on, Inversely logical processes of thought
-P-A-G-E-107
EXTREME HABITUATION. 99 
which took place frequently grow to associated ones in which 
the will is less active. Actions which were formerly performed 
with the conscious will are gradually transformed by habit into 
reflex motions, become fixed, and are in this form transmitted 
as dispositions to later generations. Habit is its own worst 
enemy, because old habits oppose the introduction of new ones. 
Extreme habituation also has a detrimental effect on the will- 
activity, because it permits it to come forward less, and changes 
all thoughts and actions into mechanical ones, robs man of his 
free self-determination, and makes a slave of him. A servile 
education can, in the most favorable cases, only create a series 
of good, steady habits, which themselves, aside from the fact 
that “hey are only means for morality and not this itself, \eave 
men in the lurch in extraordinary cases and a prey to perplex- 
ing indecision. 
Now, undoubtedly, mechanism in thought and action is not 
to be absolutely rejected. Power is saved by many mechanically 
executed functions which may be of use in other directions. 
Wundt therefore describes it as an important aid which the 
associations give to the logical thought-processes performed 
with conscious will, by forming on the one hand the preparation 
for apperceptive union (what is uniformly united in time and 
space will with pre-eminent ease also be united in the function 
of judgment), and on the other hand by taking the place of 
these processes after they have repeatedly happened. Further- 
more, certain purposes are reached by mechanism as well as by 
the conscious will-action ; yes, sometimes more easily and surely, 
because reflection. does not disturb them by coming between, 
causing delay, or leading astray by mistakes. Finally, man is 
often brought to himself and led to conscious, energetic thought 
and action by labors which he at first performed mechanically. 
Educators and teachers should, however, favor mere mechan- 
ism as little in all other psycho-physical processes as in the 
thoughtless memorizing of that which the pupil has not
-P-A-G-E-108
100 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
understood and comprehended. Lazarus points out that even 
in teaching writing and reading, all that is written or read 
should contain nothing incomprehensible to the child. He 
thinks, “No conception should enter the head that is not 
understood.” Roschow writes, “ Only the comprehension of 
what is taught renders instruction useful.” Daily experience 
teaches us that we generally think least about what we formerly 
~ adopted mechanically ; that, therefore, what is thoughtlessly 
acquired in most cases receives no further thought.

Has not all education this one purpose, that the pupil shall 
do consciously, and with free self-decision, what moral instruc- 
tion impresses upon him, what in the beginning, however, 
he does only by compulsion from parents or teachers, as well 
as from habit? Education should create a will which harmo- 
nizes with the insight determined by the moral ideas. The intel- 
ligence formed by instruction should not be an idle one, but 
should pass into the will, and therefore education does not 
want a will so much as @ will proceeding from the moral intelli- 
gence. ‘Education must enable the youth to enjoy the liberty 
of self-decision.” Spencer demands the -personal action of 
the pupil in contrast to mere reproductive reception during the 
| time of instruction; the child itself shall learn to observe. 
Montaigne and Rousseau demanded, above all, independent 
judgment of the pupil. The former said: “The bees gather 
sweets from the flowers here and there, but they make honey 
thereof which is entirely their own; it is neither thyme nor 
gentian.. In the same way the pupil will change and transform 
f that which he borrows from others, and make therefrom a work 
wholly his own. The man shall not retain the jurare in verba 
| magistri as the main principles of his thoughts and quiet himself 
with the se dixi¢, but shall understand how to form an inde- 
pendent judgment for himself!’ It is true the animal by aid of 
its instinct easily and surely performs useful actions, and the 
man proceeding in a mere mechanical way often reaches the 
2
-P-A-G-E-110
Io2- HABIT IN EDUCATION, 
goal more quickly than he who attempts to gain a perfect com- 
prehension of the causes and consequences of his actions by 
reflections. It may be true, for example, that the laborer would 
not perform his labor better and quicker than he now does if he 
knew exactly how his psycho-physical organism, his nerves, 
muscles, etc., were acting, what value his action has for mankind 
in general, and the state in particular and what place the results 
of his labor occupy in the commerce of the world, but it is sim- 
ply more worthy of a man to know why, how, and wherefore 
he thinks and does this, or allows that process to go on. Most 
persons will here perhaps be reminded of Schiller’s words :—~ 
“ We must despise the idle man 
‘Who never thinks of how he deals; 
For this is still what graces man, 
For which alone his mind expands, 
That in his inmost heart he feels 
What he created with his hands.” 
The conceptions of the cause, the means, and the reason, 
need not be clear in the mind during the function itself, and 
man need not render to himself an account of every minute 
particular of his actions every moment of his life. .After the 
plan has once been thoroughly considered and adopted, reflec- 
tion should no longer interrupt the action. But these concep- 
tions should always remain on the outskirts of consciousness and 
be ready to be raised to clear consciousness on any inducement ; 
while we use the mechanism of the body and the mental 
processes to reach our object quickly and easily. 
If, now, we finally consider the culmination of all human men- 
tal action, Genius, we shall find that here also habitude may 
have fatal results. If the practitioner needs in every action 
ever new combinations and different ways of employing the 
acquired knowledge which habit does not give him, Genius is 
also distinguished by the rapid and unusual combination of the 
various elements of the mental matter which outer and inner
-P-A-G-E-111
a ee HABIT AND FREE WILL, - 103 
experience have given it. All clever remarks and humor, as 
well as their results, depend on the newness and the uncom- 
monness of the unionof separate elements of experience. The 
difference betwee.u'these and the action of genius is, however, 
determined by the lower or higher degree of value which they 
have for things universally, the progress of culture in a nation, 
and mankind generally. It is the newness and originality of 
such combinations which distinguish the mentally conspicuous 
from the “en gross’? men who habitually form only the same or 
slightly modified combinations as education and life have taught 
them and as the general custom seems to be. “Thoughts live 
very close together” in the minds of genius and can easily enter 
into combination. And this ease in changing and combining is 
prevented by habit, which appoints to every conception its dis- 
tinct dwelling-place in a larger community. 
Where conceptions are directed by lines to certain places 
and courses, that free mobility on which their combination into 
new forms rests is excluded. The mental or habitual firmness 
of the lines destroys the fluidity which lends its charm to the 
rising conceptions. To this may be added, that lines which 
are frequently reproduced unchanged, finally lead their links 
past us so rapidly that an investigation of their condition is no 
Jonger possible ; and we are as much at a loss to comprehend 
the action after it has passed by as before it began. The close 
blending of lines of this order almost deprives them of their 
individual character, and renders them similar to impressions of 
the whole, in which all is simultaneously seen, or heard, or felt. 
And yet education can do a great deal for genius ; and the 
formation of its habits is of the utmost importance. 
Comenius says: “Genius is most in need of discipline and 
education, for it is like a fertile soil, which, unnurtured and 
uncared for, bears the most weeds, the most thorns.” 
We evidently go too far when we deny to education all good 
influence on the minds of genius, as Christman declares ; gen-
-P-A-G-E-112
104 HABIT IN -EDUCATION}., 
iuses generally have teachers who possess rjo genius themselves ; 
or, as Lichtenberg says: “If education ;succeeded in wholly 
forming the children under its influence. we should soon have 
no more great men.” It is true, that the. ‘disposition which 
education is unable to create must have existed before, and 
that by aid of this the pupil may outstrip his master ; but it is 
likewise known that a want of good education causes the finest 
talents to become weak, and is the cause of the misfortune of 
so many geniuses. 
Education accustoms the genius to diligence, by which alone 
he may hope to develop the powers slumbering within him ; it 
teaches him to beware of scattering his powers, and to concen- 
trate his actions in those fields to which his eminent talents 
particularly point ; but it does not confine him to these exclu- 
sively, and gives him a manifold interest; it forms in him the 
disposition for order and regularity, “the serious guidance of 
life.” In consequence of the rapid “tempo of thinking,” the 
easy mobility of the conceptions, the genius is often in danger 
of too great mental variability and distraction, of too rapid 
changes in the motives for actions, and in these themselves, in 
feelings and wishes whereby a moral character is rendered more 
difficult of attainment, sometimes even impossible. 
An attempt to bring the fundamental disposition into a steady 
relation with the separate feelings and passing moods leads to 
the contrast between comfortable and ingenious natures. The 
character of cheerfulness is the result of a firm, almost anxious 
hold on a certain fundamental disposition, which generally con- 
tains a medium share of seriousness and humor, and all the 
local tones of the separate feelings and moods are pitched 
according to this fundamental tone ; while in ingenious natures, 
the fundamental disposition seems to be abandoned. to the 
power of momentary humor and even strong single feelings. 
The one makes age comfortable or peevish ; the other explains 
the flood and ebb tide of joy great as the heavens, and grief
-P-A-G-E-113
7 HABIT AND FREE WILL, 105 
dark as the grave in youthfully animated hearts. A cheerful, 
comfortable disposition impresses us with a certain cordiality, 
while the variability of genius appears youthful ; both are want- 
ing in reverence for separate feelings, and when combined with 
maturity, they appear almost abnormal. In so far as good 
nature consists in keeping the disposition pure and clear, it 
forms the complement to a character bent on the purity of 
demeanor ; the restlessness of genius finds more than a mere 
complement in a life ruled by the passions. 
It should be remembered that the development and retention 
of a moral character — when it has not by education from early 
youth become a habit-— requires effort, but that geniuses use 
their greatest power in intellectual labor. Enhanced mental 
efforts cause certain reactions which explain many things. — 
Shakespeare's and Fielding’s Wild Tavern Life. Jurgen and 
Bona Meyer. 
Education enables the youth to control himself, and by habit 
to acquire firm principles for the basis of his character. ‘The 
man of conspicuous mental capacity is destined to create some- 
thing new, and raise education generally to a higher level ; he is, 
therefore, in advance of his contemporaries, and often not under- 
stood by them. The following expression of Lessing’s is well 
known: “To be considered a great mind for half a century 
after one’s death is but a poor proof that such is actually the 
case; but to be thought so through centuries is a proof not to 
be gainsaid. The contrary is likewise true, That a writer 
is not read by his contemporaries and their grandchildren is a 
misfortune, but not yet a proof against his worth; only when 
the grandchildren of the grandchildren should never care to 
read his works, then is it true that he never deserved to be 
read.” 
The consciousness of a man’s worth comes into conflict with 
external circumstances which do not offer him the necessary 
encouragement or the opportunity to carry out his reform ideas ;
-P-A-G-E-114
106 HABIT IN EDUCATION, 
thus great irritation is apt to be engendered against any contra- 
diction he may meet with; also undue exaltation and an over- 
valuing of his own personal worth. 
Rein, in speaking of Pestalozzi, remarks that the fault of all 
autodidactics has ever been one-sidedness, and an over-valuing 
of that, which left to their own resources, they discovered with 
great labor; stern misfortunes, together with the consciousness 
of pure will, render a rough tone more pardonable ; great cele- 
brity and praise from every side are apt to make men irritable 
towards rare contradiction. Genius will eastly adopt the ten- 
dency to bitterness and variance with life in general, which 
feeling only very rarely rises to the nature of humor. The latter 
has incorrectly been termed the height of true genius, and 
cultivated as such, while in reality it is only a decay, an arrest 
of true genius, and represents only a passing stage within it. 
In the rash impulsiveness of youth a genius will attempt to 
break through the bounds set him, and thoughtlessly battle 
against necessity ; where he is deprived of the opportunity to 
do this, the discord within him leads to bitterness, despair, yes, 
even to an over-clouding of the mind, insanity. 
The similarity between genius and insanity has often been 
pointed out: des extremes se touchent; the mentally deranged 
and the sick person are in nearly related conditions. 
Maudsley studied not only the similarity between genius and 
insanity, as well as other eccentric dispositions, but also the 
relations in which they appear to each other in heredity “ 
to say, a deeper investigation will bring the result tha 
inspirations, decided evidences of a talent, or even« _ 
often proceed from individuals who come from a family in 
which there was a certain predisposition to insanity. Such 
persons can take up and develop additional ideas which a 
sober brain would never have found, and by the aid of this 
side-light discover unsuspected relations. The person endowed 
with a temperament disposed to insanity may, according to
-P-A-G-E-115
HABIT AND FREE WILL. 107 
circumstances, either grow actually insane or give to the world 
new ideas and deeds. We may observe that one member of 
a family, because he entered a congenial field of labor, will go 
through life undisturbed, while another member of the same 
family falls into hopeless insanity because he is less fortunately 
placed. It frequently happens that some members of a family 
are actually insane, while others excel by an eccentric character 
or are conspicuous for some time by an excited restless demean- 
or, which afterwards changes into insanity.... The disposition 
to insanity is led to break forth into actual mental derangement 
by physical pain, the pressure of external conditions, and mental 
excitement of any kind. Maudsley even points out the close 
relation between a disposition for insanity and an inclination 
towards crime; he shows that criminals are often descended 
from families in which insanity or some other form of neurosis 
is at home, and that there have been cases in which one mem- 
ber of a family became insane while another member grew into 
a spendthrift, a worthless fellow, yes, even a criminal. He 
looks upon crime in such cases as a kind of fontanelle by which 
the unhealthy inclinations of the criminal find vent: such 
individuals would become insane if they did not turn criminals, 
and they only keep free of insanity by becoming criminals. 
A proper and good education is the only bulwark against 
such dangers; it gives the genius a feeling of respect for 
authority and reigning circumstances ; it teaches him to submit 
to necessity where the strife cannot benefit mankind, but will 
only bring himself unmeasured harm ; it enables him to remain 
passive, but also to become active the moment his action may 
be useful. By preparing the way for self-discipline it gives him 
the greatest aid in the strife with himself and life in general, 
retains the clearness and health of his thoughts, and develops 
the morality of his character. 
Maudsley and many others call our attention to the following 
fact. The education of the intelligence and the character may
-P-A-G-E-116
108 HABIT IN EDUCATION. 
conquer the inherited predisposition for insanity, and prevent 
crimes from taking place, by training and disciplining the 
“insane temper.”... If we carefully give to the will the 
power of ruling our thoughts and feelings, we create within 
ourselves a power which assures us of continued mental health. 
The power of the will will even aid frequently in remedying a 
disturbance but just begun. Returning health in mental disease 
is always announced by an increase of will-power, and a recov- 
ery of complete health is possible when the derangement is not: 
caused by organic changes, but is only functional. 
Concerning the relation of separate ingenious actions to the 
mental activity of the masses, Lazarus is no doubt right when 
he says : “ Ingenious tact finds many things that science seeks 
in vain. But the time has come, and is well prepared, for an 
advance from ingenious tact to methodical discipline, and a 
transformation of the sporadic labors of genius into the work 
of a special, conscious, continuing, and uniformly rising science. 
«+. Though the genius retain his exclusive position, he can- 
not procure a general currency for his ideas unless he finds men 
who will take the trouble to accustom the present and future 
generations to the reception and development of these ideas.” 
The true greatness of prominent men does not consist in their 
being praised and flattered by their contemporaries and pos- 
terity, in their celebrated name resounding through the land, 
but in the fact that future generations — particularly the edu- 
cated classes — receive their ideas and make them their own, 
The man of great mental capacity, prominent above others, 
scatters his thoughts abroad ; but it is the business of the edu- 
cators and teachers to lighten the soil and prepare the ground, 
that the seed of ideas may be received and bear good fruit. 
Beside the restlessly progressive power creating new things 
must be another which protects it from excesses, keeps it in 
bounds, and by quiet steady Jabor lets mankind in general 
recognize the value of the good the former has created, without 
entirely overthrowing the existing order of things.

HABIT AND FREE WILL. — 109 
Many a one who expressed new and original ideas lacked 
the power of realizing them and practically applying the ‘rules 
he himself gave (Rousseau, Pestalozzi, etc.). Genius in art and 
science is little adapted to practical business. Though the 
poet J. Von Zedlitz claims that nothing great is accomplished 
in this world without enthusiasm, the words of Jean Paul, who 
says, “Only the whole is created by enthusiasm ; its parts are 
developed by calm thought,” are no less true! Reform ideas 
will find a willing reception only when genius does not want 
practical men who realize his thoughts in calm, steady action ; 
when a restraining and calm power accompanies the one regard- 
lessly assaulting existing affairs. Thus the impetuous Luther 
found a true friend and assistant in the calm Melanchthon, who, 
with his usual clearness, perspicuity, and knowledge, gave the 
world-moving ideas of the Reformation their dogmatic expres- 
sion, and in theology as well as philosophy became the “teacher 
of Germany.” 
Maudsley truly remarks that “the ideal world of man is 
ruled by antagonistic powers as well a8 the course appointed to 
the planets: 4 centrifugal or revolutionary power gives the ex- 
pansive impulse to new ideas, a. centripetal or conservative power 
appears in the restraining habit, and the result of these contrasts 
determines the direction in which the mental development pro- 
gresses.” 
When the formation of habits is used in the proper way, 
if it is not carried to the extreme by contracting the limits of 
conceptions favoring mere mechanism, and -weakening the 
emotions, but teaches how the danger of distraction may be 
avoided, a concentration of power united with varied and mani- 
fold interests be acquired, how man may retain his free self-deci- 
sion and develop his character, how the feeling of happiness is 
increased by the regularity of work and recreation, — it will be 
the main aid of education in giving man or mankind “what he 
might have developed from within himself more easily and 
quickly.”

Pyrnacoras knew that if the strings of a musical instrument 
were of the same quality, of equal tension, but of unequal 
length, their lengths must be in the proportion of 1: 2, of 2:35 
or 3:4, in order to produce the perfect consonances of octave, 
treble, or quarte. In modern times, the relations 4:5 and 
5:6 have been added, but without the ability of stating the 
reason why just these proportions bring forth these consonances, 
Musicians as well as philosophers and physicists have mostly 
rested content with the answer, that the human soul could, in 
some way unknown to us, find out the numerical relations of 
sound-vibrations, and that it felt an especial pleasure in viewing 
simple and easily scanned relations. The excellent work of 
Helmholtz brought the explanation: The physiologic-physical 
investigation shows that two sounds can only be felt simultane- 
ously in the ear without disturbing each other in their outflow 
if they stand in certain positive interval-relations one to the 
other, — the well-known intervals of the musical consonances. 
Helmholtz further showed that the upper tones appear far more 
frequently, and are of greater importance than was hitherto 
believed, and that they actually determine the shade of the 
sound of various instruments.

Periodical vibrations of the air, for instance, amounting from 
16 to 36,000 in a second, affect us as sound, and by aid of our
-P-A-G-E-120
112 APPENDIX. 
external organs of hearing and our nerves we perceive a musical 
sound if the vibrations are regular; a noise, if irregular ; and, 
according as the vibrations are slow or more rapid, we perceive 
deep or high tones. 
Vibrations of the air, averaging 450-785 billions a second, 
which strike our organ of vision, are perceived as light or color: 
red, 450; yellow, 526; green, 589; blue, 640; indigo, 722; 
violet, according to the number of vibrations. Between the 
impressions caused by sound and by light are those produced 
by the changes of temperature. They begin far above the 
upper limit of the former, and extend beyond the lower limit of 
the latter.

Plateau counts the average length of sight-sensations as 32- 
35 seconds, and claims that it increases in direct proportion 
with the intensity of the impression, for which reason the retinal- 
after-images of brightly illuminated objects are of comparatively ‘ 
long duration. This continuance of the sensation causes two 
impressions, which follow each other very rapidly, to intermingle 
with each other, and to be perceived as a:single, longer sensa- 
tion, — thus a glowing coal, swinging on a cord in a circle will 
appear as a fiery ring. A revolving disc on which the colors of 
the spectrum are painted will appear white because all colors 
intermingle, and the resulting impression is the simple white. 
Lazarus says: “ For several minutes after the first impression 
has passed, a copy of the same color will remain; when the 
sensation, however, lasts longer, so that the nerves grow tired, a 
complementary retinal-after-image will follow the one of like 
color (complementary colors are those which, when mixed in 
due proportion, produce white) ; as, red and greenish-blue, 
orange and blue, yellow and indigo, greenish-yellow and violet. 
With red impressions, the secondary picture is blue-green ; for 
violet, greenish-yellow ; for green, purple; for white. light, it is
-P-A-G-E-121

black, while on the other hand, a black object on light ground 
produces a white picture. The complementary retinal-after- 
image is either positive, when it is seen in comparatively equal 
or even greater brightness than the original impression, or nega- 
tive, when it is seen with less brightness ; the latter is the more 
general.” 
{ 
Note 4. ' 
The example of a swinging stick is often used in explaining 
this. Ifin a dark room we could swing a stick to and fro at 
any rate we pleased, we should find that at first, with slow 
motion, we noticed no effect, then perhaps a draft; if the 
motion were quickened to about 20 vibrations a second, we 
should hear a deep tone, which, up to 36,000 vibrations, would 
become higher and higher, going through the entire scale. 
Then, fora time we would receive no impressions ; later still, 
warmth ; when the celerity reached 450 billion vibrations in a 
second, light, and one after another the different spectral colors, 
— red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The rays 
beyond violet, which were first discovered by their chemical 
action, are not visible generally, or at least affect our eye much 
less than the others ; they can, however, be rendered visible in an 
artificial way by the exclusion of all other light. ~ Helmholtz, 
The rays at the other end of the spectrum, usually invisible, 
may be perceived by the exclusion of the brighter, generally 
visible light. At the red end, in fact, the sun-spectrum reaches 
farther than can be discerned by the eye. Up to the present 
time it has only been possible to make these over-red rays 
perceivable by their heat-effect; and they have therefore been 
termed dark-heat rays. 
Electricity and magnetism, finally, are, according to the view 
of highly celebrated naturalists of the present day, also vibratory 
motions of great velocity. (Electricity, longitudinal; mag- 
netism, revolving ; while light is a transverse mode of motion.)
-P-A-G-E-122
114 APPENDIX. 
The difference between the transverse motion of light and the 
longitudinal vibrations of electricity would also explain the fact 
why transparent objects, which allow rays of light to pass 
through, do not transmit electricity ; and inversely, why the best 
conductors of electricity are opaque. We possess no separate 
sense by which we can feel the electric and magnetic phenom- 
ena separately. Electricity is perceived by man as light or heat ; 
as soon as led through bodies, it changes into the motions of 
light or heat. 
Nore 5. 
With the lowest Protozoics, light very likely acts only as heat. 
On the other hand, we must be in doubt whether some forma- 
tions connected with the organs of touch in animals are to be 
reckoned with the usual organs of touch, or whether they trans- 
mit special sense-impressions which the specific conditions of 
the life of the animal possessing them call forth. In this suppo- 
sition, goblet-shaped formations found in the skin of fishes have 
indeed been counted a sixth sense ; invariably found on animals 
living in the water, they may transmit impressions which 
change with the flow of water or its chemical condition. — 
Wundt. , 
The impressions of higher organisms are caused by a differ- 
entiation of originally similar sensory sensations. The functions 
of the sense of feeling, the touch, temperature, and general 
sensations, appear here as the common source of development. 
The general organ of touch is perfected by the development of 
special touch apparatus ; from it arise specific sensory instru- 
ments, perhaps in connection with certain cilicious cells which 
appear among some lower animals as a special outfit of certain 
parts of the skin. For the continuation of the smell and taste 
cells are ciliates which, by virtue of position and condition, are 
eminently susceptible to certain modes of impression. Other 
tells of the skin are, by deposits of pigment and cuticular for-

‘mations, pre-eminently open to the photo-chemical effect of 
light, and the reception of light-impressions. — Wundit.

As electricity was present in nature from the beginning, but 
only came to be recognized in its entire breadth by man since 
the end of the last century, it might prove the same with as yet 
undiscovered powers of nature. 
If now, however, those who practise spiritualism and hypno- 
tism or animal magnetism raised the opinion that here was such 
a new, natural power which was somewhat related to magnetism, 
investigation has, concerning the former, made it very probable ; 
and. concerning the latter, positively certain that the legerde- 
main tricks of spiritualism, as well as the seemingly miraculous 
facts of hypnotism, can be explained by the already discovered 
natural laws, and that those travelling artists, who practise these 
so-called sciences, have not discovered or made known a new 
natural power. 
When Prof. Ulrici, in Halle, in 1879, published his essay, 
“So-called Spiritualism a Scientific Question,” in which he, 
basing the phenomena of spiritualism, not upon a new power of 
nature, but upon spirits and the souls of the departed, drew 
great arguments from it for the belief in the immortality of the 
soul, W. Wundt published “Spiritualism a So-called Scientific 
Question,” in which he shows with masterly skill that Ulrici is 
indeed right when he, like all who have studied this subject, 
claims that the spirit-apparitions do not point to a new power 
in nature, but without doubt to voluntary actions of intelligent 
beings; but that the claim of an interference on the part of 
departed spirits annuls the laws of nature, and injures the 
Prevailing causality by the introduction of an occasional and 
lawlessly acting supernatural cause ; while on the other hand it 
Jeads to unworthy and actually materialistic conceptions with 
regard to these spirits. _ ~

‘116 APPENDIX. 
Animal magnetism appeared when, at the end of the last 
century, the discovery of magnetism set all minds in motion. 
Mesmer performed his magical animal-magnetic cures under 
many intentional and unintentional illusions ; and the literature 
about somnambulism and animal magnetism became very volu- 
minous, while many experiments were made concerning it by 
scientific men. These proved that this was not at all a new 
natural power, which certain persons controlled, but that every 
man could by practise gain the power of producing the hypnotic 
condition by even and uniform impressions on the senses 
(which also call forth the usual condition of sleep) ; that, 
furthermore, this hypnotic condition is, so to speak, an artificial 
somnambulism, and consists of a partial interception of con- 
sciousness, and still more of the will.

If, in the explosive dissolution, we say there is a disposition 
towards dissolution in the atomic union, we do not mean 
thereby to explain the phenomenon, but only to intimate in a 
short way the connection between the grouping of the atoms 
in the union and the explosive dissolution caused by slight 
external causes,

We know from later investigations in Physics, that. ether- 
vibrations in the form of light-waves reverberate for a longer or 
shorter time in phosphorescent bodies, and can outlast the 
creating agency. Still more positive were the results obtained 
by Niepce de Saint Victor in his investigations concerning the 
dynamic properties of light ; he could show that light-vibrations 
may be collected, so to say, on a piece of paper, and retained 
as silent vibrations for more or less time, to break forth again 
under the influence of an awakening agency. Copper plates 
were first exposed to the sun, then kept in the dark, and

several months after their insulation it was still possible by 
special functionary agents to call forth traces of the continued 
photographic influence of the sun on the surface of the copper 
plates,

Agglutination is especially perceptible in the study of lan- 
guage ; in the word-combinations, vai/-road, servant-man, lead- 
pencil, we find the process exemplified. In earlier stages of 
development, language showed even more such agglutinations. 
Science even calls an entire class of languages of the present 
time agglutinative languages ; these include most of the Asiatic 
and Polynesian dialects. Some of these dialects, however, no 
longer show the pure agglutination. 
Our present language offers some examples of the blending 
process in the formation of words. 
In the development of language, most of the agglutinative 
combinations gradually change to blended unions, as the ele- 
ments are more closely knit together, and thereby lose their 
independence.

In the development of language it is best shown in the 
Romance languages in contrast to the blending and condensa- 
tion of the Latin: Latin emavi, French j’ai aimé.

  PREFACE 
Educational writers and lecturers have long emphasized 
the importance and necessity ot a distinct aim for every 
class recitation. Their contentions for general and specific 
recitation aims are in this day deemed axiomatic to 
effective teaching. Recent years have noted a strong 
movement culminating in a more fruitful realization of 
specific recitation aims than ever before. This present 
departure in educational practice owes its life to the 
advent and proper use of mental and educational tests. 
Their use makes possible diagnosis—general and analytic 
—of classroom results and corrective methods for the 
improvement of the same, culminating in diagnostic 
testing and remedial teaching. The hope of such culmina- 
tion is the theme of this book. 
“Diagnostic Testing and Remedial Teaching” was 
developed from lectures adapted for a brief course in 
mental and educational measurements, designed to 
acquaint teachers and prospective teachers with some of 
the commonly used tests and scales to the extent that 
they may be intelligently applied in a rural or grade 
classroom. Testing should culminate in the proper choice 
of appropriate teaching methods. Corrective methods 
have been stressed in this work on the thesis that they 
can best be selected only after class strengths and weak- 
nesses are revealed by diagnostic instruments. 
The language and presentation of materials in this book 
are simplified in order to place the content within the 
easy understanding of such rural and grade teachers who 
are not acquainted with tests. The content is sufficiently

concrete to be thoroughly practical, being illustrated with 
results reached through tests of and experiments with 
1275 elementary school, parochial school and high school 
pupils and teachers. The approach to the subject of 
diagnostic testing and remedial teaching is designed 
to be as useful for the superintendent as for the teacher 
herself. It is hoped that the elementary character of 
this volume will meet the needs of teachers’ reading 
circles interested in using and applying mental and edu- 
cational tests and scales. 
As it is impossible to write a modern book on science 
without repeated consultation and use of scientific dis- 
coveries made by many research students, so it is im- 
possible to incorporate in a book late advances in 
education except by numerous references to recent edu- 
cational discoveries. The author wishes, hereby, to 
acknowledge gratefully the use of most valuable material 
gleaned from many sources, and the use of educational 
and mental tests and scales of numerous authors. He is 
especially obligated to Gray, Horn, and Monroe for their 
contributions in the Yearbooks of the National Society 
for the Study of Education and to Courtis for contribu- 
tions in spelling. 
Such success as this work may attain is due also to 
the cooperation of county superintendents, and notably 
to the helpful attitude of Superintendent Glenn 
(Aberdeen) and many of his teachers and principals. 
The inspiration culminating in this volume had its 
inception at the University of Wisconsin where the author 
studied educational measurements under Dr. Elliott and 
the Binet-Simon Mental Tests under Dr. O’Shea.

INTRODUCTION 
The forces that have been responsible for changes in 
the theory of education have been numerous and varied. 
Many of them have apparently been external to the edu- 
cational system. It is a fact well known to every student 
of the history of education that new subjects of study, 
for example, have been introduced largely because of 
forces and pressures that lie outside the schools. It is 
also true that many of the newer and more modern devices 
and agencies of education, such as medical examination, 
dental clinics, playground instruction, gardening, and the 
like, have found their way into school practice, not 
because the school teachers of the country urgently 
insisted upon their introduction but rather because of 
the influence of certain groups not in any way directly 
or intimately connected with the schools. Practically all 
of the shifts and changes in the materials and in the 
administrative practices of education thus far represent 
society’s efforts to adjust the schools to its needs. 
Educational progress has not moved forward in one 
continuous unbroken line. On the contrary, it has been 
zigzag, due to variations in the emphasis of the various 
factors that play upon the school. The pressures that 
have the dominant influence upon education in one gen- 
eration are seldom those that dominate in the next genera- 
tion. Each new pressure usually develops an impelling 
public opinion which registers itself finally in some cur-

x INTRODUCTION 
ricular change or in some modification of administrative 
procedure. 
In addition to those sanctions that have been primarily 
responsible for the enrichment of the curriculum and the 
introduction of new types of administrative units there 
has been another guarantee of educational progress, a 
guarantee indigenous to American soil. It is the funda- 
mental principle that we shall provide as nearly free and 
equal educational privileges and opportunities as is 
possible. While this ideal has not been fully realized, 
it has nevertheless been more responsible than any other 
single factor for the enactment of compulsory education 
laws, requiring attendance at school during certain ages. 
The upper age limit provided by this law is being gradu- 
ally raised in many of the states. Society recognizes that 
its problems have grown increasingly more numerous and 
complex and that an intelligent understanding of them is 
imperative if democratic institutions are to survive. For 
this reason, compulsory education laws have been enacted. 
If democracy rests upon an intelligent citizenry, then 
those capable of profiting by education must go to school. 
If democracy’s problems grow more intricate, complex 
and difficult of solution, then education must be revamped 
to provide the training necessary for their solution; and 
if a revamping and reorganization of the materials of 
education is not enough to provide the training necessary 
for the intelligent disposition of democracy’s problems, 
then more training must be provided. This is what has 
been done in the past, and it is what must be done in 
the future. 
When the iron grip of law had forced all or practically 
all types of mind into school—the dependent, the de- 
linquent, the anemic, the tubercular, the weak, the slow,

the precocious, as well as the normal child,—the teachers 
suddenly found themselves face to face with a new set 
of problems. Hitherto the student population had been 
largely a selected population, and the curriculum had been 
uniform and required of all. Now the teachers began to 
welcome as well as to search for new types of materials 
to interest, ie., to attract and hold new types of mind. 
They were, therefore, not wholly antagonistic to or un- 
sympathetic with the demands of society that new mate- 
rials should be included to satisfy new social demands. 
And they also began to pay an increasing amount of 
attention to the technique of instruction for they began 
to recognize that different methods as well as variation 
in materials were necessary to appeal to the wide range 
of abilities represented in the student body. 
Out of these three sets of conditions, the enrichment 
and modification of materials to serve the new types of 
mind now in school, the discovery of individual differ- 
ences, and the variation of the technique of instruction to 
stimulate the various types of mind, there gradually 
emerged the beginnings of a new science, the science of 
education. Its origin cannot be attributed wholly to the 
factors we have just enumerated, but they were by far 
the most impelling ones operating in the field of educa- 
tion. Scientific method had been applied to many fields 
before it was applied to education. When first applied 
to education, it concerned itself chiefly with matters of 
cost, retardation, elimination, acceleration, failure by 
subjects and grades, the mobility of students, the salary, 
training and experience of teachers. A little later it began 
to direct its activities to the diagnosis of mentality and 
the progress and achievement of children in school. 
The scientific movement in education was not always  
-P-A-G-E-12
xii INTRODUCTION 
welcomed by teachers or laymen. Many of the “studies” 
were ridiculed and the authors were sometimes regarded 
with contempt. This attitude on the part of the un- 
informed was, however, not new to science. Every im- 
portant advance and discovery of science has had to win 
its way in the face of stiff opposition. While this has 
sometimes delayed progress here and there, opposition on 
the whole, where it has not been too blind, has been 
beneficial. It has meant that science has been forced to 
prove its case. 
It has been so in education. At first the contributions 
of the scientists in education were questioned, scrutinized, 
criticized and less than half welcome, but the students 
of educational problems refused to be discouraged. 
Methodically, patiently, with almost unending drudgery, 
serious minded and well trained men and women persisted 
in applying the methods and instruments of science to 
educational problems. The technique of investigation 
was refined and made more accurate. The number of 
studies increased enormously. They touched every field 
and phase of education, including the status of students 
at various stages of their advancement, the classification 
of students on the basis of their varying abilities, and 
their achievements in various subjects of study. 
Gradually but certainly, the mass effect of hundreds of 
these technical investigations became so powerful that it 
could not be withstood. Only one more question ap- 
parently remained to be answered. There were those who 
said, “Now, that you have discovered new instruments 
and measures of education, how can they actually be 
applied, ie., can the classroom teacher and the admin- 
istrator make use of them in their daily work?” Many 
illustrations of their actual and possible use have been

given in the literature on education. Almost no books 
dealing with their every-day application to the school- 
room have appeared. 
But we need wait no longer, for this manuscript covers 
this matter in a comprehensive manner. This final ques- 
tion which so many have asked, the author answers. The 
book is not a book on statistics. It is not an attempt to 
interest teachers in devising new instruments of measure- 
ment. It is not an historical review of the science of 
education. It is a definite attempt to apply what has 
been worked out scientifically to the daily work of the 
school, and in such a clear, concrete and suggestive 
manner that no teacher can fail to use it. Every detail 
of the manuscript has been tested by experience. The 
things advocated will work. It is a challenge to every 
teacher interested in improving himself and in advancing 
the cause of education.

DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND 
REMEDIAL TEACHING 
CHAPTER I 
DIAGNOSING CLASSROOM WORK 
Questions 
1. When you mark papers in arithmetic, are the marks correct and. 
reliable? 
2. Which elementary school subjects, if any, are easiest to grade 
with precision? Why? 
3. What standards are used in the business world for measuring 
commercial products? Should standards be used in the educational 
world for measuring educational products? Why? 
4, Examinations should reveal to the instructor weaknesses 1n her 
teaching. Do they reveal whether her methods are well chosen? Why? 
5. A reputable medical practitioner diagnoses his patient, then pre- 
scribes remedies to meet a known pathological condition. Is there an 
analogy between medical treatment and effective group and individual 
teaching in the classroom? Explain. 
6. Justify or disprove that “In the absence of educational tests, most 
teaching from the standpoint of methodology could not help being 
other than imitative of the patent-medicine-vender style of relieving 
sickness.” 
Problem: A teacher marks fourth grade arithmetic 
papers. Are those marks correct and reliable? 
Experiments at Teachers’ Institutes: (a) Walworth 
County, South Dakota. Let the following material, 
gathered from teachers, help answer the question. At 
a teachers’ institute held in Walworth County, South

In this experiment the teachers were shown the list as 
it would come to them in the form of a paper turned in 
at the close of a spelling recitation. They were asked to 
grade this paper on the basis of 100 per cent for a perfect 
paper. This spelling paper received the grades immedi- 
ately following:

There was no intimation given the institute of how to 
grade or what to do, except to mark the spelling paper 
on the basis of 100 per cent, still the grades ranged from 
20 per cent through 80 per cent. Fourteen teachers 
marked this paper 20 per cent, 2 marked it 25 per cent, 
4 marked it 30 per cent, 16 marked it 40 per cent, and so 
on. Among the sixty-six teachers who marked it there 
was decided disagreement as to its percentage value. 
It was suggested by some present that some other sub- 
ject than spelling would be easier to grade. Therefore, 
two problems in arithmetic were given this same group of

teachers to mark. Each teacher marked the problems 
given below.

Example 2 was added audibly thiswise: 7 and 3 equals 
10; 10 and 5 equals 15; 15 and 4 equals 18. Sixty-eight 
teachers graded the above examples with these results:

On the above simple arithmetic exercise 7 teachers 
graded the paper 35 per cent; 10 graded it 40; others 
graded it 45, 50, 60, 65, 70, 80 and 90 per cent. The 
range ' in grading the spelling was 20 per cent through 80 
per cent and that in grading the arithmetic was 35 per 
cent through 90 per cent. 
(b) Dodge County, Wisconsin. As a further proof of 
the unreliability of marking, a study in grading penman- 
ship was made in 1916 by the author at a Wisconsin 
Teachers’ Institute. A sample of penmanship was con-

the highest mark, the extremes, and is read a range of 20 per cent 
through 80 per cent. In this illustration the range covers 60 points,

tributed for this purpose by one of the seventh grade 
students. This sample was duplicated in every detail to 
be like the original. One duplicate was handed each 
teacher attending the institute and also the instructors. 
Teachers and instructors were directed to grade the 
paper on the basis of 100 per cent. No further directions 
were given the institute. The graded papers were 
collected. 
All but ten of the teachers deemed it necessary in grad- 
ing the paper to indicate from which school grade this 
sample was presented. The distribution of the sample by 
school grades irrespective of the per cent value is indi- 
cated in Table III.

To locate the paper in a particular school grade im- 
plies that a 40 per cent paper in grade four is different 
from a 40 per cent paper in grade six or any other grade. 
There is a significance in this belief which does not con- 
cern us in this part of a discussion on diagnostic teaching. 
The point is this, Table III indicates that not even a fair 
number of teachers adjudge one paper as belonging to 
but one certain grade. Six teachers classed the penman- 
ship sample as second grade work, none as third grade 
work, six as fourth grade work, 24 as fifth grade work, 
some as sixth, seventh, and eighth grade work and 38 
teachers classed it as a high school effort. Ten teachers

did not deem it necessary to indicate any grade when 
evaluating the writing. 
These samples of penmanship were rearranged on a 
percentage basis. The percentage grades attached to the 
papers and the number of persons marking the papers 
a given percentage, appear in Table IV. 
The duplicates of one and the same pupil’s penman- 
ship were graded 50 per cent by three teachers, 70 per 
cent by twelve teachers, up to 95 by twenty-seven 
teachers. The range here being from 50 per cent through 
95 per cent, covers forty-five of one hundred points, or 
almost one-half of the distance from 0 to 100.

(c) Edmunds County, South Dakota. Another trial 
at the reliability of grading papers was made at a 
teachers’ institute in Edmunds County, South Dakota, 
in 1918. The membership at this meeting of teachers, 
was given mimeographed copies of two questions and 
answers in history used in the common school examina- 
tion the preceding spring. The questions and answers 
are here reproduced. 
Unrrep Srares History 
“J, Explain the Monroe Doctrine. What caused the President to 
make such a declaration? 
The Monroe Doctrine was a declaration made by President Monroe 
in his Message to Congress in 1823, in which he declared: 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
1. That the United States would not allow any European power 
to plant any new colonies on the American continent. 
2. That we resolved to let the affairs of the old world alone. 
3. That we determined that they in return should not meddle 
with the affairs of our country. 
It means that we consider ‘America is for Americans.’ 
Several South American countries and Mexico had declared them- 
selves republics, independent of Spain. This greatly displeased 
some of the European kings and the Czar of Russia as they wanted 
to gain more territory in America, so they formed an alliance to 
force these countries again under the rule of Spain. This was a 
thing that did not appeal to us so President Monroe made this 
declaration. 
2. What were the causes of the Mexican War? The Civil War? 
Spanish-American War? 
The causes of the Mexican War were the dispute over the boundary 
line, the invasion of Texas by Santa Anna, and the death of 
Crockett at the Alamo. 
Civil War was caused by the Southern States holding slaves which 
was against the law of humanity. 
The Spanish-American was caused by Spain’s brutal treatment of 
the Cubans and the sinking of the battleship Maine which was 
blamed to Spain, and several other causes. Spain was beaten 
everywhere in a short time. The United States acquired the Philip- 
pines and freed Cuba.” 
The two questions were marked on the scale of 20. 
Table V gives the result of this experiment. The 
lowest mark was 12, which was given by six teachers, the 
next higher was 15, which was given by eighteen teachers, 
and so on with a perfect mark given the paper by six 
teachers. On a 100 per cent scale this gives a range of 
60 to 100 per cent.

  DIAGNOSING CLASSROOM WORK 7 
Thus far, this study on the reliability of grading re- 
veals that in spelling, arithmetic, penmanship, and his- 
tory there apparently is a great difference in the opinion 
of teachers as to what is a poor, good or excellent piece 
of school work. 
(d) Normal School Classes. Each quarter of the 
school year and in each summer session, the author gives 
a course in educational measurements. The normal 
school classes in measurements, consisting of students 
fresh from the high school and of teachers whose experi- 
ence extends over a number of years, are given papers to 
grade when they study the variability in the grades they 
assign to class papers as that shown in Tables I to V 
on the preceding pages. In a study of penmanship 
one class gave grades covering a range of 35 per cent to 95 
per cent; a third class, in grading a composition, covered 
a range of 35 per cent to 95 per cent. 
Investigation by Starch and Elliott—Professors Starch 
and Elliott, both of the University of Wisconsin at the 
time the study was made, published the results of an 
experiment in the “Reliability of the Grading of High 
School Work in English” (15a).1_ They had concluded 
that the grading system used in marking examination 
papers is not reliable. This conclusion raised objections 
among teachers. There were those who said that a more 
exact study such as mathematics would be evaluated with 
more uniformity by teachers. Therefore, Professors 
Elliott and Starch directed another study, this one on 
grading mathematics (15b). They obtained a geometry 
final examination paper submitted by a student to his 
teacher. This paper was reproduced, and sent to one

schools show large ranges, from 25 through 88 in the 
one instance and from 39 through 88 in the other. 
The conclusion drawn by the authors on the reliability 
of grading papers in English and mathematics are: “The 
investigation shows the extremely wide variation of the 
grades even more forcibly than our study of English 
marks.” “. .. an alarming fact is the wide range of the 
distribution.” “Our investigation shows that the marks 
of this particular geometry paper vary even more widely 
than the marks of the English paper used in the former 
study.” 
A third study of the problem of reliability of grading 
was conducted in 1913. This one was on the grading of 
history (15c). In this study the same general plan was 
pursued as that employed by Starch and Elliott in their 
previous studies and they arrived at the same general 
conclusions previously reached; namely, 1. “. . . marks 
assigned to the same paper by different teachers vary 
enormously ...” 2. “The variability or unreliability of 
marks is as great in one subject as in another.” 3. “The 
immense variability of marks tends obviously to cast 
considerable discredit upon the fairness and accuracy of 
our present methods of evaluating the quality of work 
in school.” 
Table VI is a summary of the range in the grades 
given by teachers on papers submitted to them for eval- 
uation. In the first item the lowest grade given to 
the spelling paper at the Walworth County Teachers’ 
Institute was 20 per cent and the highest grade was 80 
per cent. The difference between the lowest and the 
highest grades given this spelling paper is 60, repre- 
senting a range of 60. The other nine items are inter- 
preted in the same way. Item 3 shows a range of 45

while possibly it should be more, owing to the fact that 
the lowest per cent was given to a paper which the re- 
spondent marked “6th grade.” Doubtless, this might be 
overcome at the other end of the scale, for some papers 
were marked 100. 
The grades in Item 4 were on the basis of 20 per cent 
for a correct paper, but two questions being given. The 
grades on these two questions were resolved to a basis 
of 100 per cent for a perfect paper, so as to afford a 
common basis for comparison in Table VI. The average 
of the lowest grades given to the ten papers by 530 
different persons, all teachers or prospective teachers, was 
36.6 per cent, the median for low score. The median for 
high score on the items in this table was 92.5 with a 
consequent average range of 55.9 per cent points. This 
means that 530 teachers in marking ten sets of papers 
differed in their opinion of what the papers are worth to 
the extent of 56 points.

By way of conclusion it may be said:— 
1. That the usual methods of grading written class 
work or examinations show great variation in grading; 
hence, grades are not a reliable means of evaluating the 
written school product. 
2. That while the present system of grading is con- 
venient from the administrative standpoint, it must be 
supplemented by a better system. 
3. That variation in grading is entirely independent of 
where the grading is done, by whom it is done, or what 
subjects or subject-matter are graded. 
The above conclusions are arrived at through a com- 
parison of grades given by many teachers to a few 
papers. 
Problem: If teachers in school A grade pupils this’ 
year and other teachers in school B grade the same pupils 
next year, will the grades of the two groups of teachers 
agree or differ? Why? 
Finkelstein’s Investigation —Dr. Starch (14) reports a 
study made by Finkelstein in answer to this question. 
Finkelstein compares the marks given by two instructors 
to the same group of students. One instructor taught 
the class during the first semester and the other taught 
it during the second semester. Finkelstein’s distribution 
of the marks given by the two instructors is given below:

  12 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
Deerborn’s Study.—Dearborn reports a study made of 
the marks given by the same instructors in the same 
college. Some of these instructors gave ten times as 
many A’s as others did and less than one-tenth as many 
F’s (failures). 
Foster’s Study—‘Foster found in the elementary 
courses at Harvard that A’s were thirty-five times as 
common in Greek as in English (16).” 
Carter’s Investigation—Carter (3) compared the arith- 
metic marks of eighth grade pupils from three Milwaukee 
ward schools with the freshman algebra marks in the 
high school. He concludes thus: “When the rank of the 
pupils in arithmetic was compared with their rank in 
algebra, it was found that a greater per cent of school B 
(the school which gave the lowest marks) excelled in 
maintaining their original rank or increasing it. In fact 
there was a complete reversal of things from what the 
absolute marks might indicate.” Stated otherwise, two 
sets of measures of these pupils showed differences rather 
than agreement. 
Kelly’s Investigation—Kelly (9) made an extensive 
study of the reliability of teacher’s marks. One of the 
investigations consisted of a comparison of the marks of 
the sixth grade classes in four ward schools in Hacken- 
sack, New Jersey, and their marks obtained from de- 
partment teachers in a seventh grade in the same city. 
The two sets of compared marks were, therefore, given 
by two different groups of teachers. Regarding this in- 
vestigation, Kelly concludes as follows: “This means 
that for work which the teacher in school ‘C’ (one of 
the ward schools) would give a mark of ‘G’ (good) in 
language, penmanship, or history, the teacher in school 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  
  DIAGNOSING CLASSROOM WORK 13 
‘D’ (another ward school) would give less than a mark 
of ‘F’ (fair).” 
Another still more interesting investigation is recorded 
by Kelly (9). According to this experiment six fifth 
grade teachers gave a uniform examination to their 
pupils. Each teacher graded her set of papers, kept a 
record of her grades but did not record any marks on the 
examination papers. One teacher who had not seen the 
papers, prepared a definite and systematic plan for mark- 
ing them. The teachers who had marked the papers 
regraded them, using as their guide the new system. 
Each paper thus received two grades from the same 
teacher, the first grade being given on the basis of no 
special plan and the second on the basis of a systematic 
plan uniform for all the teachers. The first group of 
marks, obtained under no definite plan, when compared 
with the “judge” agreed in 5.5 per cent of the cases; but 
the second group of marks obtained under a systematic 
plan, when compared with the “judge” agreed in 63.5 
per cent of the cases. 
Problem: A natural or normal distribution of marks 
should give (14) : 
7%  ’s or excellents 
24% B’s or superiors 
38% C's or averages 
24% D’s or inferiors 
7%  £E’s or unsatisfactories 
Are the examination marks given by a teacher to her 
class distributed in the same way? 
Johnson’s Investigation—Johnson (7), Principal of the 
University High School of the University of Chicago, 
made an investigation which answers this question.

a long stretch of the imagination can we suppose that
-P-A-G-E-33
    
DIAGNOSING CLASSROOM WORK 15 
teachers’ marks generally distribute according to the nor- 
mal graph of distribution. 
Traditional Marking System.—Recent commentators on 
our traditional grading are unanimous in their opinion 
that it is unreliable and in need of improvement. One 
such comment is here reproduced (16): 
When a student received 70 as the official rating of his work for a 
year in English composition, or elementary chemistry, or the history 
of England, neither he nor we knew what it was 70 of, or whether it 
was really 60, or 70, or 80 of it. Clearly defined units of measure and 
instruments by which to count them were lacking* 
The present condition at its best is shocking. The average correla- 
tion between the grades given in a subject and a student’s real achieve- 
ment in it is, in even the best American colleges, almost certainly 
not over 80, which means that the official ratings are six-tenths as 
erroneous as would be the case if the grades were assigned at random 
by a child as in a lottery. If 900 students pass and 100 fail by the 
official ratings in a subject, there is every reason to believe that nearly 
half of those who failed really did better than some of those who 
passed? 
Problem: Why is there such great difference of opin- 
ton among conscientious teachers on the value of school 
marks? 
First, there is an absence of uniformity in examina- 
tions. However, such uniformity as arises from state 
controlled examinations as those given in New York and 
some other states, will not correct the difficulty. It seems 
highly probable that examinations can be standardized to 
the extent that more uniform results than those obtained 
at present will be obtained. In this connection it is 
worth noting what the investigations of Courtis will 
reveal to the teaching world (5). 
Secondly, questions devised by a teacher and not 
*P. 373. 
*P. 375. 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  16 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
standardized have unequal values (10). This is evident 
from the fact that some of the questions are correctly 
answered by most of the pupils and other questions are 
correctly answered by but a few. Nevertheless, the 
teacher adjudges a correct answer to each question as 
being worth 10 per cent or 20 per cent as the case may be. 
Thirdly, the teacher is not a good judge of the difficulty 
of a question. Its wording partly determines its diffi- 
culty to the pupil. Some forms of wording are harder of 
comprehension than others. Comin (4) made an inves- 
tigation supporting this contention. 
Time Element in Examinations.—This determines qual- 
ity of grades. Some teachers expect that all the examina- 
tion questions be answered during a given period of time 
and mark on that assumption. Others insist that no 
pupil will be penalized if he answers at least the average 
number of questions answered by the class. 
Standards Vary.—The standards by which papers are 
graded differ with teachers. There are almost as many 
standards as there are individual teachers. Some 
teachers discount the mark in arithmetic for poor spell- 
ing, others do not; some discount the arithmetic mark 
for poor English. Others penalize the English grade for 
poor English in other subjects. Neatness, arrangement, 
punctuation, conciseness of answer, elaborateness of an- 
swer, are some elements of standards used, in different 
degrees, by teachers. From the standpoint of perfection, 
not all teachers agree to the value which should be given 
a problem in arithmetic worked by the correct method 
but having an incorrect answer. Again, while some 
teachers mark correct a spelling word, others mark it 
wrong. Subjective standards should be eliminated from 
school work. They cause retardation, disinterestedness,
-P-A-G-E-35
  DIAGNOSING CLASSROOM WORK 17 
disobedience, and withdrawal from school (17). They 
leave us with no accurate unit of measuring school 
products. 
Question: Do we need to use educational tests for 
measuring purposes? 
The above facts and conclusions suggest the need of 
placing in the hands of the teacher some other measuring 
instrument, than examinations, for evaluating school 
work, This instrument should be relatively certain in 
securing uniformity of grades on a given piece of work. 
It should permit of attaining results with reasonable 
speed. Educators have claimed that examinations should 
disclose special weaknesses of the class as a whole, and 
of the individual members of a class, but they are found 
wanting in this respect. 
The claim is made that educational tests are an objec- 
tive measure of school systems and of school work (1), 
(18). The extensive use made in recent years of mental 
and educational tests corroborates the advantages accru- 
ing from employing them in school work. 
Why Use Tests?—Reasons from standpoint of: 
I. Large educational unit, as a state: 
1. Tests enable educators to make comparisons be- 
tween work done by rural and city schools. 
2. They make possible comparisons of work done by 
two or more states. 
II, Superintendent and supervisor: 
1. Tests determine scientifically how much time 
should be apportioned to each subject.
-P-A-G-E-36

  DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
They single out the ward schools which are most 
needy of supervisory assistance. 
They single out the weakest teachers and others 
of the teaching staff who are most in need of 
expert supervisory help. 
Tests are an instrument which measures the 
progress of respective schools within a system. 
III, Teachers: 
1. Tests are a relatively absolute determinative of 
2. the merit of teaching quality. 
This paragraph from Judd elaborates, in part, 
the above point: 
It may be unscientific to prophesy about the remoter 
social consequences of such a movement as we are dis- 
cussing (the use of educational and mental tests), but 
certain final observations may serve to show why the advo- 
cates of measurement in education are unlimitedly opti- 
mistic. The time is rapidly passing when the reformer 
can praise his new devices and offer as the reason for his 
satisfaction, his personal observation of what was accom- 
plished. The superintendent who reports to his board on 
the basis of mere opinion is rapidly becoming a relic of 
an earlier and unscientific age. There are indications that 
even the principals of elementary schools are beginning to 
study their schools by exact methods and are basing their 
supervision on the results of their measurements of what 
teachers accomplish. A social change of this kind is ade- 
quate justification for any movement and a sufficient 
guarantee for its continuance. 
Tests are a protection to the faithful teacher. 
Teachers with agreeable personalities but me- 
diocre abilities will not be over-rated on the 
quality of results obtained. Conscientious 
teachers of marked ability will be discovered 
despite personal handicaps.

IV. Adjudging efficient methods: 
Only in recent years is effort being made to de- 
termine the qualitative value of method. Certain 
methods should be chosen because they have been 
proven superior to other methods in use. The sub- 
ject of general methods must largely yield place to 
one of specific methods. Class weaknesses are of a 
specific character as are the weaknesses of groups 
and individuals within a class. To correct such 
specific weaknesses there should be chosen specific 
methods which possess latent possibilities, when cor- 
rectly used, to correct such known weaknesses. A 
few methods have been evaluated with this idea in 
view but not many studies have been maue in this 
direction.* 
V. The Class Group: 
1. Tests disclose whether a class is up to standard 
when received by the new teacher. 
2. They disclose promptly and exactly how much 
progress a class makes from term to term. 
8. They disclose the strong, weak, and average 
groups within the class. 
4. Some tests diagnose the special weaknesses and 
strengths of such class groups, thus paving the 
way for remedial teaching. 
5. They disclose whether a teacher is conserving 
the brain power of the class or is letting it go 
to waste.

Reading in the Dubuque Schools.

  DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
VI. The Individual Pupil: 
1. Tests determine promptly and conclusively 
whether a pupil is making progress and how 
much. ; 
2. They are an absolute instrument in determining 
quickly and reliably promotion, retention, and 
reclassification of the individual pupil. 
8. They exhibit the extent to which a child utilizes 
his mental talents and map out for the teacher 
the possible need of pupil direction and cor- 
rective teaching. 
4. They make possible intelligent individual in- 
struction. The new attitude on this point is 
well voiced by Davis! (6) in this language: 
“Individual learning rather than mass teaching 
now holds recognition,’ also “smaller groups 
make possible more vital education”; and adopt 
“method to specific pupil needs.” 
VII. Further Uses: 
Educational tests, when correctly used, insure 
uniformity of grades on a given piece of work; they 
do not entail a prohibitive amount of work; they: 
are as speedy as examinations in most cases; and 
best of all, they possess a diagnostic value far in 
excess of what can be expected of an examination. 
Educational tests point out criteria by which to 
arrive at methods most useful to a particular class. 
In ordinary school practice teachers have conscien- 
tiously sought out the best methods to employ in 
teaching their classes. In some instances these 
eee
-P-A-G-E-39
DIAGNOSING CLASSROOM WORK 21 
methods were selected discriminately but in the 
main the choice was through trial and error and 
usually the method possessed no value directable 
at a particular class fault. A method is appropriate 
in so far as it meets a known pathological class- 
room condition. To illustrate, a pupil adds this 
column of figures by counting out the full value 
of each digit, leaving dots in his tracks. A diag- 
nosis of this adding exercise points out that .2. 
(a) the combinations are not well learned, :4: 
(b) that while the child may know the 2 plus :3. 
4 combination, he needs drill on the 12 plus :5:. 
2 type of addition. Therefore, to improve —— 
column addition as here performed, methods 14 
must be chosen to satisfy weaknesses shown in 
points (a) and (b). 
What Kind of Drill and Special Help Should Be Given in 
Teaching Long Division or Reading?—Certain develop- 
mental work must be done first. This is general in char- 
acter for which any well established method should be 
used, but there are groups in a class in long division, one 
group making mistakes in multiplication, another in sub- 
traction, and a third in skipping a figure in bringing down 
the next figure of the partial dividend. After the devel- 
opmental teaching is finished not any one method should 
be employed in teaching arithmetic in this class. There 
being several types of weakness, the teacher should use 
many points of attack. A separate method will attempt 
to correct each type of weakness and each pupil will be 
placed in the proper group according to his special dif- 
ficulty in long division. A fuller discussion of what 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
22 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
methods should be employed in remedying these three 
types of errors, will appear in Chapter X. 
In selecting drill material in reading, methods can be 
determined by a wise manipulation of reading tests. A 
pupil may read with apparent fluency but with very 
little understanding. Without an educational test, a 
teacher may surmise correctly that comprehension in 
reading is unsatisfactory, but nothing else will help her 
to know better the degree of comprehension of the class 
than an educational test. Knowing exactly how poorly 
the child understands what he reads, the teacher knows 
what kind of drill to give, and how much of it. She will, 
therefore, choose reading material and methods which 
will improve the comprehension of the child or group 
showing such a weakness. How to discover weaknesses 
in reading and what methods should be used to correct 
them will be discussed in Chapter IX, Diagnosis in 
Reading. 
Test Limitations—It is not claimed that the work in 
every subject can be diagnosed through the use of edu- 
cational tests, but this is the case because educational 
testing is a relatively new idea and satisfactory tests 
have not been devised for use in every school subject. 
Some educators claim that teaching can be diagnosed 
without using tests. Some diagnosis is possible without 
tests but specific and exact diagnosis is not possible. 
The following chapters bear witness to this fact. 
Patent-medicine Teaching—In the absence of educa- 
tional tests, most teaching from the standpoint of 
methodology could not help being other than imitative 
of the patent-medicine-vender style of relieving sickness. 
The vender sells a medicine for which are claimed numer- 
ous virtues. It possesses the power, according to his 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
  DIAGNOSING CLASSROOM WORK 23 
disposition, to cure any of a dozen ailments. We, as 
teachers, have discovered that a class is poor in addition 
and so we drill, drill, drill on addition, supposing that 
mere drill will correct class, group, and individual dif- 
ficulties. Mere drill may be a good patent-medicine but 
to make any teaching a prescription, the specific ailment 
must be diagnosed and then a specific remedy, properly 
chosen, should be used as a corrective. 
Ballou (2) says, “Finally, it should be emphasized 
that standard tests are for diagnostic purposes: they 
show the abilities and needs of children. Recently one 
teacher said: ‘My class has taken the Courtis tests in 
arithmetic twice each year for three years and I do not 
see that it has done them any good!’ On investigation 
it was found that this teacher had made no effort what- 
soever to use the information furnished by the tests as 
a basis for correcting the many weaknesses shown among 
her pupils. There is no special magic in standard tests 
which will work any educational miracles upon pupils 
who take them. The teacher must be made to realize 
that the results from the tests are for her information. 
Unless she is shown how to make use of them, and is will- 
ing to do so, standard testing is not worth while. On the 
one hand, if the teacher is willing and intelligent, the in- 
formation derived from standard tests is of the greatest 
service, for it enables her to reach desired goals by the 
most direct path, with the least expenditure of energy 
and labor on her part and with the greatest benefit to the 
children.” 
Diagnostic teaching implies the absence of random 
teaching. It implies that methods are chosen by the 
teacher with the full knowledge that they are effective in 
making the class strong in comprehension in reading, or  
-P-A-G-E-42
  24 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
in developing reasoning power in arithmetic, or in de- 
veloping greater powers in punctuation, or in building a 
needed vocabulary. This kind of teaching-to-the-point 
where a known specific class, or group, or individual 
weakness exists, economizes the teacher’s and the child’s 
time and effort in the schoolroom. There is still a pre- 
vailing sentiment that teaching is a general activity 
which can be entered into by persons poorly prepared, 
and re-entered upon by others, successfully, after a lapse 
of years, without becoming acquainted with the new con- 
tributions to education. When education becomes a 
science, as it is becoming, the general public will not 
question with a feeling of competence, the schoolroom 
procedure of a ‘teacher any more zealously than that 
public would now question the findings of an engineer 
in the construction of a massive building, nor would an 
ex-teacher, after the lapse of several years, feel competent 
to enter a schoolroom and teach successfully without 
further preparation, any more than a retired physician 
should think of resuming the practice of medicine until 
he had posted himself on the progress in the science of 
his vocation since his temporary. retirement. Diagnostic 
teaching is scientific work. Effective teaching bears also 
the stamp of the master. To prescribe requires scientific 
knowledge and insight; to apply the remedy effectively 
calls forth the artist. 
How Far Is Diagnosis Possible?—This is a pertinent 
question and at once practical or else all we say about 
education as a science is mere theory not transfusible 
into practice. Diagnosis is most possible in such subjects 
of study in the elementary and secondary schools as 
already have developed for them reliable and easily 
usable educational tests. There is no question today 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  DIAGNOSING CLASSROOM WORK 25 
about the usability of tests developed for spelling, writ- 
ing, reading, arithmetic, and algebra. While not so well 
developed from the practical standpoint, there are edu- 
cational tests which can serve as partial guides in diag- 
nosing the teaching of language, geography, history, 
Latin, physics and other subjects. 
Educational tests were almost derided by some school 
men not more than six years ago. Mentality tests were 
a foreign language to most teachers five years ago. We 
now have a perfect combined mental-educational survey 
test through the effective use of which school teaching 
and administration will be made more effective than ever 
before (12, 18).

possible to mark it. Compare the grades. Do they agree or difier? 
Why? 
2. What is meant by range?

than others? What subjects were graded by different groups of teachers 
in the studies discussed in this chapter? In which subjects was there 
greatest agreement on the grades given, if there was agreement at all? 
4, Suppose you grade a geography paper today, then after a lapse 
of time grade the same paper again. Would you, if you had forgotten 
the first mark, be likely to duplicate that first mark? 
5. A pupil’s paper in arithmetic is marked 80 per cent. Two weeks 
later an irate parent presents the same paper and asks for a regrading. 
If you had forgotten the first grade, without consulting the records, 
could you expect to regrade the paper as it was marked before? How 
would you explain to the parent this difference in the two grades, both 
conscientiously given?

  CHAPTER II 
MEDIAN—HOW TO FIND IT 
Questions 
1. The farmer uses the bushel for measuring grain. What definite, 
well-known standard of measurement does the teacher use in measuring 
number work, reading, or composition? 
2. How much measureable produce has the teacher of a reading 
class if the grades of the pupils range from 50 per cent to 95 per cent? 
3. When she knows that some quantity of educational produce is at 
hand, with what educational unit of measure can she determine the 
exact amount of class product? 
Commercial and Educational Yardsticks—In diagnosing 
the work of any class through the use of educational 
tests, one of the first steps to take consists of comparing 
the class work with some standard. The commercial 
world employs a variety of standards with which to meas- 
ure produce. The grocer weighs sugar, using as a stand- 
ard the pound; the saleslady measures cloth, using as a 
standard the yard; the coal dealer weighs coal, using as 
a standard the ton; the farmer measures grain, using as a 
standard the bushel; the surveyor measures distances, 
using as a standard the rod, chain, or mile. Other com- 
mercial standards used are the pint, quart, gram, liter, 
and meter. The value of these standards is known to 
the customer and therefore can be used effectively in 
measuring what he buys. In measuring certain educa- 
tional products there too must be a standard correspond- 
28
-P-A-G-E-47
  THE MEDIAN 29 
ing to the many commercial standards. It is not for us 
here to question how educational standards are obtained. 
Their development is intricate. The brevity of this work 
will not warrant going into the matter. Tests exist. We 
have educational tests to measure the quality of writing, 
also the speed; to measure second, third, fourth, or any 
grade ability in spelling; to measure accuracy and speed 
in arithmetic. There are still other definite standards 
with which to compare educational products, using such 
standards as educational yardsticks. 
A commercial product as sugar or vinegar, cannot be 
measured unless we have a definite amount of either of 
them. An educational product cannot be measured un- 
less we have a definite amount of such product to meas- 
ure. We cannot measure comprehension, for instance, 
unless there is a definite amount of comprehension to 
measure. If teachers would measure they must, there- 
fore, have standards with which to compare and also 
definite amounts of educational produce to measure. 
Research studies in education supply them with stand- 
ards. The teachers must supply the definite quantities 
of the produce for measurement in classroom achieve- 
ment. 
How May Classroom Results be Presented for Measure- 
ment?—The teacher must first get the average of her 
class work. If the comprehension of members of a class 
in reading is recorded as 35, 40, 60, 38, 40, 35, 55, ete., the 
average of this class in comprehension is obtained by 
adding the several scores and then dividing by the num- 
ber of pupils in the class. This procedure gives a class 
average but it will not invariably give the pivotal point 
midway between the lowest and highest achievement 
in the class. 
   
-P-A-G-E-48
  30 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
This computation gives an average of 42.6 in 
comprehension. This is one way of finding an 
6 average but it is not as reliable as it should be. 
60 A more reliable average is obtainable. It is 
38 called a median. 
In finding a median we try to locate the 
fe middle point of a number of marks. If nine 
3g men stand in a row as in Fig. 1 then the man 
55 at the middle is the fifth man from the left end 
as also he is from the right end. The fifth man 
8)341 in the group in Fig. 1 is at the median point. 
Should we arrange eleven boys in a row, the 
42.6 sixth boy from either end is at the central or 
“ median point. If we arrange thirteen composi- 
tion papers in the increasing order of their 
value, as in Fig. 2, then the paper at the center, the 
seventh paper marked 75 per cent, is at the central or 
median point.

If there is an even number of pupils in the class then 
the median is still the central point but we need make 
allowance for an extra half not really represented by a 
particular pupil. To illustrate, suppose that 14 pupils 
receive grades on samples of penmanship. We arrange 
the papers in the order of their quality as in Fig. 3.

There is no central point as when we illustrate with an 
odd number of pupils. The central point or median is 
between the 8th and 9th pupils, representing a per cent 
between 65 and 68, in this instance. 
In Fig. 3 the central point, however, is affected by the 
presence of 2-50 per cent, 2-60 per cent, and 2-70 per 
cent marks. In such an instance, to get the central 
point, or median, correctly, it is necessary first to arrange 
the papers in the order of their value. Suppose 15 pupils 
receive grades in arithmetic as follows: 50, 85, 92, 85, 
69, 88, 76, 83, 93, 76, 80, 64, 63, 76, 82. To find the me- 
dian we first rearrange the grades in the order of their 
numerical value thus: 50, 54, 63, 65, 69, 76, 76, 76, 80, 
82, 85, 87, 88, 92, 93. 
What Shall We Do with These Grades to Get the Median? 
—tThe next step is to put the grades into a table placing 
all the number of times that a per cent occurs into one 
part of the table, and all the number of times that an- 
other per cent occurs into another part of the table. There 
are several tables possible. Table VIII illustrates one 
possibility. In this table there are ten steps: one step is 
from 0 through 9.9, another step from 10 through 19.9, 
another step is from 20 through 29.9, and so on. Each 
step in Table V has the same size. The size of the lowest 
step from 0 through 9.9 units appears to be 9.9 units, 
but in practice we call this a step of 10 units. The size 
of step 10 through 19.9 also appears to be 9.9 units, but 
practically this is a step of 10 units. All the other steps 
in this table are 10 units in size. Table VIII is a Dis-

tribution Table. The idea of a distribution table can be 
further clarified by thinking of it as a stairway. Each 
tread of this stairway represents a step. Of these there 
are ten in number. Hach riser in the stairway represents 
the size of the step. Each riser or step consists of ten 
units.

How to Place the Per Cent in the Distribution Table— 
Now that the distribution is completed the next necessary 
procedure is to place the proper number of scores re- 
ceived by the pupils in the arithmetic class (see p. 31) 
opposite the proper step in the table. 
None of the pupils in the arithmetic class mentioned 
on page 31 received a mark between 0-9.9 so 0 is written 
opposite this step under the frequencies (Fre.). Fre- 
quencies means the number of pupils who get the 15 
grades in arithmetic. No pupils received a mark between 
10-19.9 so 0 is written opposite the second step. For the 
same reason 0 is written in the frequencies column.

    opposite the 3rd, 4th, and 5th steps. One pupil is marked 
50 per cent and another 54 per cent. Both of these per 
cents fall in the step 50-59.9, therefore, since two pupils 
were marked between 50 per cent and 59.9 per cent, we 
write 2 in the frequencies column opposite the sixth step 
representing the number of times there are per cents be- 
tween 50-59.9. One pupil is marked 63, another 65 per 
cent, and a third 69 per cent. Each of these three per 
cents fall into the step 60-69.9 per cent, so we write 3 into 
the frequencies column opposite 60-69.9 or the seventh 
step, counting from the bottom up. Three students are 
marked each 76 per cent so we write 3 in the frequencies 
column opposite the next higher step. Five students 
receive grades between 80-89.9 so we write 5 in the fre- 
quencies column opposite the 80-89.9 step. One student 
gets 92 per cent on his arithmetic paper and a second a 
grade of 93 per cent. Since there are 2 frequencies in the 
90-100 step, we write 2 in the frequencies column oppo- 
site the highest step. 
We next add the frequencies, giving in this instance a
-P-A-G-E-52
  34 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
total of 15. The number of frequencies is always the 
same as the number of papers marked and recorded by 
the teacher. All the above work is necessary and pre- 
liminary to finding the median. 
Finding the Median.—(a) We define the median as the 
central one of a number of papers. This is the half way 
point between the end papers when all papers are ar- 
ranged in increasing order of percentage value. To get 
near the central point, we divide the number of papers, 
in this instance 15 (Table IX) by 2. The central point 
is the 7.5 paper. But in finding the median (M) we 
want to find the percentage grade of the pupil’s paper at 
the central point. To get this we count the frequencies 
in the frequencies column, beginning at the bottom, but 
we may not count beyond ¥% the sum of the frequencies, 
that is, not beyond 7.5. The greatest sum we get is 2 
and 3 or 5 frequencies (see Table IX, also Problem 1, 
part b). If we counted the next three frequencies, we 
would get 8, or more than the middle point which is 
7.5. For convenience of checking work, we draw a line 
above the last frequency added, and we place the sum 
obtained, at the end of this line. (See Table IX.) But 
the last 3 frequencies added are opposite the 60-69.9 
per cent step. In other words the median of the class is 
at least 70 per cent, hence, we write it down in our cal- 
culation (Problem 1, part e). As yet we have ac- 
counted for but 5 papers; these are the sum of the 2 and 
3 frequencies. We must account for 7.5 papers to get 
the median point. So we must account for 2.5 papers 
more, or part a less part b. There are 3 papers marked 
70-79.9 per cent and of these we may count but 2.5 (part 
¢ in the Problem).

In other words we count 2.5 of the 3 papers or eS 
papers in this step (see Problem, part d). The size of 
each step in the distribution is 10 or 10 per cent of the 
entire 100 points or 100 per cent in the table, so we count 
2.5 upward, or add aE OS 10 per cent or 8.3 per cent (Prob- 
lem, part d). We have already counted upward 70 per 
cent or an estimated median (Est. M.) of 70 (part e). 
We count up 8.3 more, the correction (cor.), hence, 
the correction is added to the estimated median, the sum 
thus obtained giving the true median (T. M.) of 78.3. 
Putting it another way the median ability of this arith- 
metic class is 78.3 per cent. 
(b) There are two other types of problems we fre- 
quently meet in finding the median. In each type make 
first a distribution table, then record the frequencies as 
in Table IX. Table X illustrates a type of problem in 
which the median is obtained without the need of mak- 
ing a correction. No correction need be made because 
the half sum of the frequencies falls between two fre- 
quencies. The half sum is 16. Adding the frequencies, 
beginning at the bottom of the frequencies column, we   
 
-P-A-G-E-54

stop adding after the 4 frequencies opposite the step 
40-49.9 for we get then the half sum with no more “points

  THE MEDIAN 37 
The half sum is 19. This places the estimated median 
at 50. The correct supposition to make is that since one- 
half of the frequencies fall above the 0 frequency and 
the other half below the 0 frequency, that the mid-point 
is in the middle of the step with 0 frequencies. The size 
of this step (50-59.9) being 10, the mid-point of the step 
is % X 10 or 5 (Table XI, b), hence 5 is the correction 
added to the estimated median of 50, giving 55 for the 
true median. 
In finding the median it is just as correct to count 
downward from above, estimating the median, and then 
making the correction, but this procedure requires sub- 
tracting the correction to get the T. M. However, to 
avoid the confusion of learning the two ways, only the 
one fully explained, will be used in all work here given.

  38 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
steps are used. For instance, let us find the median of 
the arithmetic class whose grades appear on page 31, 
Fig. 3, using steps of 5 in the distribution table. 
There are 2 frequencies in the 50-54.9 step, one pupil 
received 50 per cent and another 54 per cent. No pupil 
was marked from 55-59.9 per cent, hence 0 frequencies 
are recorded opposite this step. One pupil received a 
grade between 60-64.9 per cent, hence 1 frequency is 
recorded in this step. Two pupils receive grades between 
65-69.9 per cent, none receive grades in the next step. 
There are three pupils marked 76, so 3 frequencies are 
recorded opposite the next step. One pupil received a 
grade of 80 per cent and, while practically 79.9 is re- 
garded as 80, in order to avoid recording 80 in two dif- 
ferent steps, and thus recording one pupil twice, we 
designate one step as 75-79.9 which excludes all 80 per 
cent marks and brings the 80 per cent in the 80-84.9 
step. This practice is followed whether we make a dis- 
tribution table in steps of 2.5 or 10. Recording the 
remaining frequencies should now be understood. 
The method of finding the estimated median (Est. M.) 
and the true median (T. M.) on the same data, for ex- 
ample the same class in arithmetic, is the same; but when 
steps of 10 are used in finding the median we get 78.3 as 
the central point (Problem 1, page 35), whereas the 
central point is 79.16 when a step of 5 is used in the 
distribution table (see Table XII). The smaller the step 
the more accurate is the median. 
(d) Using the same data let us illustrate how to find 
the median when the frequency table is in steps of 2.5. 
In using educational tests sometimes the author of 
the test devises his own frequency table. This is the 
case in using the Monroe Silent Reading Test. Since the
-P-A-G-E-57
  THE MEDIAN 39 
Monroe Standardized Silent Reading Test Revised is 
used in this work, it is unnecessary to elaborate this 
point except to say that when in any test the steps are 
not uniform the size of the step must be computed in 
finding the median.

All educational tests which have been perfected use 
some standard to represent the accomplishment of each 
grade for which the test is devised. This standard is the 
educational yardstick with which the teacher or super- 
intendent measures the class. A comparison is possible 
only when the class median is known, after which it can 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  40 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
be determined whether the class is below, measures up to, 
or is above the standard of accomplishment. How such 
comparisons are made and the use that is made of 
them by the classroom teacher are parts of succeeding 
chapters.

In using educational tests, as in making studies in 
economics, statistics, or engineering, an effective way of 
representing results, is by appealing to the eye. It is, 
therefore, necessary to give a brief treatment of graphs, 
discussing such of them as are of greatest help in an 
elementary use of schoolroom tests. 
Value of Graphs in School Work—In measuring the 
school product the graph is valuable from both the 
pupil’s and the teacher’s standpoint. A graph can more 
42
-P-A-G-E-61
  
GRAPHIC REPRESENTATIONS 43 
tangibly show the pupil’s ability at various periods of the 
year than grades such as 80 per cent, 85 per cent, B 
or A. As a matter of fact, school grades obtained by a 
pupil are, in the first place, unreliable and, in the second 
place, they are not on the same phase of school work. 
They are, therefore, of no value to the pupil or the 
teacher to show progress or retrogression. While not 
always used to show the progress of a class or a pupil, 
graphs may be so used with satisfactory results. Then, 
too, educational tests which employ graphs in represent- 
ing results are always on the same phases of a subject of 
study. To graph the accomplishment of an arithmetic 
class in September, again in January, and to compare 
these results with the standards for those months, gives 
the class an objective goal to work for. An individual’s 
work can be graphed periodically and compared with the 
class medians and the standards. In this way a tangible 
motive can be supplied which can be made very 
stimulating. 
Graphing the school product is even more serviceable 
from the teacher’s point of view. The graph yields a 
tangible comparison of this year’s fourth grade in Sep- 
tember, January and April with another fourth grade in 
the same school last year, or with the fourth grade in 
your school and that in an adjoining school. The teacher 
can use the graph to show clearly the progress of her 
class from one season to another. 
The superintendent can use graphs to show not only 
the progress of classes in a particular grade over a period 
of one year but also the progress that the same grade is 
making in the fundamental subjects in each successive 
year in the elementary grades. The graph shows data 
which enables him to justify the retention of the strong

teacher in his corps. Truly most of these things could

(a) Bar graph. One kind of graph is represented by a 
straight line, drawn either vertically or horizontally. In 
Graph V a vertical line is used. This graph credits to 
Farmer A 300 bushels of wheat in the elevator; Farmer 
B, 400 bushels; Farmer C, 150 bushels; and so on.

Sometimes it is more convenient to use rectangles in 
graphic representation. Rectangles, like lines, may be 
used vertically or horizontally. 
By using rectangles and shading a part of them, bank 
deposits for each month are recorded as are also the 
totals. (Graph VII.) A straight line graph would make 
the triple record for each depositor impossible in one 
graph. Graph VII could easily be used to record, for 
instance, the speed in arithmetic in each of two weeks

and the total problems worked by each pupil in the class 
in that time. As Graph VI employs a different way of 
depicting the same idea that Graph I shows, so another 
graph, using horizontal rectangles, could be constructed 
to depict Graph VII. 
(b) Line Graph or Frequency Polygon. A combination 
of rectangles adjacent to each other gives still another 
form of graph (Graph VIII). Graph VIII shows that 
four pupils each were marked 50 per cent; five 55 per 
cent; two 60 per cent; one 65 per cent; etc. The same idea 
could be graphed with less labor by using only the top 
lines and parts of the sides of the rectangles as in Graph

How to Make a Graph after Forms of Graphs V and VI— 
One more point needs to be made clear in the use of 
educational tests, viz: how to make a graph from given 
data. 
Problem: Twelve pupils in a spelling class are marked, 
50, 52, 55, 58, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, and 100.

through the twelve in the class. We may designate the 
pupils on the base line. On the vertical line at the left 
we may record the possible per cents from 0 to 100. 
Since pupil 1 gets a mark of 50 per cent, we draw a line 
from 1 parallel to the line at the left, making this line

score is 52 per cent, is drawn from the base line at 2, 
parallel to the other two lines, and as high as 52 per cent. 
By following this procedure all the pupils are graphed 
as in Graph XIII. 
There is so much similarity between Graphs V and VI 
that no illustration is necessary to show how Graph VI 
is made.

regular intervals and label the intervals 2, 4, 6, ete., up 
to the largest number of pupils in one grade, but no

represents girls. After the same principle draw a rec-

length of any rectangle represents all the pupils in the

that the rectangles are placed adjacent to each other. To

MENTALITY AND TEACHING 
Questions 
1. To what extent should height of pupils determine the grade into 
which they are placed? Weight? Age? Health? Mentality? 
2. To what extent should height of pupils determine how long they 
should be retained in a grade? Weight? Age? Health? Mentality? 
3. Should a pupil be promoted ahead of his fellows during the 
course of the year? If so, on what conditions? 
4. Should mentality be a determining factor in prompting irregular 
promotions? Why? 
5. Is it possible to measure definitely a pupil’s mental ability? 
6. Should a pupil with average mental ability spend eight years in 
completing eight years’ work? Why? Should a pupil of very high 
mental ability spend eight years in completing the eight years of the 
elementary school? Why? 
7. Should every child be required to spend a year in the kinder- 
garten? Why? 
8. One board of education rules that no child may enter the kinder- 
garten before the age of five; another rules that no child may enter 
the kindergarten before the mental age of five. Which is the better 
regulation? Why? Are both rulings practicable? 
Individual Differences in Children.—Select one hundred 
nine-year-old children. In this group you locate decided 
differences in several respects. The group shows much 
variation in height, the shortest children being, perhaps, 
three feet high and the tallest about four and one-half 
feet high. The group discloses an equal variation in 
weight covering a range from about fifty-five pounds to 
one hundred thirty pounds. There is represented within 
this group an equally great difference in agility of move-

mendous differences in the mentality that exists in chil- 
dren of the same chronological age.” 1 
Graph XV shows that although chronologically 9 years 
old, but 48 of these 159 children had a mental age of 9 
years. The mental age of one nine-year-old child was 
six years; that of 17 children was 7 years; of 64 children 
was 8 years. Twenty-one children in this group had a 
mental age of 10 years, and 8 of them a mental age of

11 years. An unselected group of twelve-year-old chil- 
dren, chronologically, would reveal equally large differ- 
ences in mental age. Groups of unselected children of 
any other chronological age would reveal such differences 
in mental ages as tabulated below. The chronological 
age of a child or of a group of children is no criteria by 
which to judge the native mental capacity or mental age 
of such child or children.

ee ee eee eee alae rae belief (TT ees (LL ebay CT eat TTT sa Thirty pupils are promoted from Grade IV to Grade 
V. Is not the fact that they are classified in a single 
grade proof that all have nearly the same mental age? 
An affirmative answer to this question has been gener- 
ally assumed in educational practice and for the most 
part we still labor under it in school administration, 
supervision, and teaching. Studies have been made 
which illuminate the question, leaving no room for doubt. 
See Table XVI. 
This table means that 4 first grade children had a 
mental age of 3 years; 22, a mental age of 4 years; 31, 
a mental age of 5 years, etc. The results for the fifth

and ninth grades are read in the same way. Clearly, 
then, there is great difference in the mental ability of 
children in any one grade and it matters not whether it 
is in the primary, intermediate, or the junior high school 
department. - 
Homogeneous Grouping of Children. —To overcome in a 
single grade the heterogeneous grouping of children from 
the standpoint of mentality, various administrative de- 
vices have been employed with varying degrees of suc- 
cess. Two of these devices, teachers’ estimates of pupils’ 
work and mentality tests, stand out prominently. Sev- 
eral questions are at once raised by using such devices. 
First, is homogeneous grouping of children desirable? 
Second, if desirable, cannot homogeneity be obtained 
through teachers’ estimates of pupils’ work independ- 
ently of mentality tests? Both of these questions will 
be answered in the sections immediately following. 
(a) Terman on Grouping: Great strides are yearly 
made in the uses to which mental tests are put, however; 
even as far back as 1916 Terman (15) recommended 
using mentality tests for classification of children. He 
writes,! “Indeed, it would be desirable to make all pro- 
motions on the basis chiefly of intellectual ability. 
Hitherto the school has had to rely on tests of informa- 
tion because reliable tests of intelligence have not until 
recently been available. As trained Binet examiners 
become more plentiful, the information standard will 
have to give way to the criterion which asks merely that 
the child shall be able to do the work of the next higher 
grade. The brief intelligence test is not only more en- 
lightening than the examination, it is also more hygienic. 
The school examination is often for the child a source 
* Pages 16-17.
-P-A-G-E-77
  MENTALITY AND TEACHING 59 
of worry and anxiety; the mental test is an interesting 
and pleasant experience.” 
(b) Dr. Martha Adler’s (1) experiments were con- 
ducted with a view to determining how and to what 
extent mental tests can be used as a basis for the classi- 
fication of school children. She lays down two theses.* 
“Subject-matter increases in importance as the child 
advances,—in fact, we are too much bound by a curric- 
ulum, and classifications, gradations and groupings are 
made with reference to it, rather than with reference to 
the pupils. What we need is something which will in- 
crease the importance of the child’s individuality.” 
“Our premise was that pupils of advanced intelligence 
should not only make more rapid progress than those of 
younger mental age, but that methods of instruction 
should be adapted to mental maturity.” 
Two experiments were made by Dr. Adler. The first 
was with seventy first grade boys who were about to 
begin the second half of first grade work. Dr. God- 
dard’s 1911 revision of the Binet-Simon tests was used 
for testing these boys. Thirty-five of the children who 
tested highest were classified in the advanced section. 
The other pupils were classified in the regular section. 
The methods of teaching were adapted to the mental 
abilities of the two class groups. 
The results of the first experiment are promising. “In 
the work in arithmetic it was noted that a much shorter 
period was needed by the pupils of the advanced group 
for objective work, and it was not a difficult task for 
them to acquire the more advanced work.” 
* Page 23. 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  60 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
At the end of the term, “eighteen (pupils) have al- 
ready completed the first half of the second year’s work, 
and are ready to begin the second half of the second 
year’s work. They have therefore gained six months 
during their first school year.” A 
Dr. Adler concludes: “The Binet Tests form an excel- 
lent basis for the classification of young pupils. 
“That this basis also serves as a guide in adopting 
methods of teaching to mental abilities. That greater 
uniformity of mental ability in a given class is secured 
thereby, and that a classification based on test results 
enables a large percentage of mentally mature pupils to 
advance rapidly.” 
Dr. Adler’s second experiment will be discussed under 
homogeneous classification of fourth grade pupils. 
(c) Dr. Judd on Traditional Promotion. Dr. Judd 
(7) criticizes adversely the traditional method of promo- 
tion into the first grade. He says,’ “Furthermore, it is 
complained by a large number of the primary teachers 
that the arbitrary method of promotion out of the kin- 
dergarten, which depends on the arrival of the sixth 
birthday rather than on any real achievement on the 
part of the child, is far from satisfactory because it brings 
up from the kindergarten the immature and the mature 
alike. . . . Evidently, if the complaints of these teachers 
are to be met there must be a thoroughgoing revision of 
the relations between the kindergarten and the first 
grade.” 
(d) The Davis investigation (4) was conducted at 
Jackson, Michigan, where Miss Davis serves as director 
of measurements and special education. Under her 
direction the Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon tests 
*Page 167.

was used on an “elaborate scale for controlling the admis- 
sion of pupils from the kindergarten to the low-first 
grade.” Accordingly the director and the kindergarten 
teachers administered the tests to 420 prospective candi- 
dates for admission to the 1-B grade.

* Of these 24, 10 were absent one month or more in all. 
Table XVII summarizes the results of Miss Davis’ in- 
vestigation. She adds that * “there exists a positive corre- 
spondence between mental age and success in the primary 
work. EHighty-one per cent of those who had attained 
a mental age of six or more at entrance were promoted 
at the end of the semester, whereas only fifty-nine per 
cent of those who had attained a mental age of from 
5:8 to 6:0 were promoted, while all seven of the pupils 
whose mental age was less than 5:8 at entrance failed in 
their primary work. In the future it will be our policy 
to limit entrance to the first grade, in so far as feasible, 
to pupils who have attained a mental age of 6.” 
A part of the final paragraph of Miss Davis’ article 
reads, “In conclusion it may be said that the use of 
*Page 141. 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  62 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
intelligence tests in the classification of pupils in this 
school system has received the hearty support of the 
teachers, . . .” 
(e) Dr. Adler’s experiment with fourth grade boys 
(1) is further evidence proving that mentality tests 
should be used in determining the classification of chil- 
dren in the grades. Portions of several tests were used 
in testing the mentality of this group of fourth grade 
boys. On the basis of the test results over a third of 
the pupils were placed into the advanced section and 
the remainder of the group constituted the regular sec- 
tion. Methods were adapted to suit the needs of the two 
class groups. 
The results of this experiment are complimentary to 
scientific school supervision and teaching. At the end 
of one year “Twenty-two of the thirty-five (advanced 
group) pupils are ready to begin the second half of the 
fifth grade work. Thirteen of the pupils begin the regu- 
lar fifth grade work, though several of these will prob- 
ably be able to catch up with the advanced pupils before 
the end of the term. One pupil who was absent because 
of contagion will be retarded.” 
Dr. Adler further adds that, “As a result of the work 
thus far concluded we are convinced that mental tests, 
combining both individual and class, form an excellent 
basis for the classification of pupils of middle grades. 
That advanced and rapid work can be done by pupils 
who test high mentally, and that high grade habits of 
study can be inculcated in them.” 
(f) Callihan’s (2) experiment in the use of intelligence 
tests as a basis for proper grouping and promotion of 
school children was tried on seventh grade pupils in 
May. The Illinois Survey, except the arithmetic part
-P-A-G-E-81
  
MENTALITY AND TEACHING 63 
of same, was used to determine the mentality of these 
285 pupils. On the basis of the test results the pupils 
were classified and placed in homogeneous groups as 
eighth graders the succeeding fall. A course of study 
was worked out for each of the groups in the eight rooms 
to which these children were assigned in a central 
building. 
After six months’ trial under this new system of classi- 
fication Callihan remarks, “It has been necessary thus 
far to make only five transfers, three of which were pro- 
motions and two were demotions, a fact which is very 
good evidence of the reliability of intelligence tests as 
a means of grouping pupils on the basis of ability.” 
The May test was checked by a second one given the 
following October, “the results placing the rooms in 
exactly the same order as they were placed by the first 
test.” 
The more advanced groups economized time by cover- 
ing ground faster than the slower ones. 
Quoting from the original article: “We are firm be- 
lievers in an enriched curriculum in the first six grades 
to give those pupils of superior intelligence a broader 
and deeper foundation for future work, but after the 
sixth grade we should afford the opportunity to those 
who are able to complete the last six years in less than 
that time. If pupils in Room B (an advanced group) 
continue to progress, as we believe they will, they should 
complete the last five years of their elementary and sec- 
ondary school work in four years.” 
(g) The Glass investigation concerned itself with this 
Problem: Which are more reliable with large numbers of children 
for purposes of classification, teacher’s estimates of pupils’ work or 
an objective standard based on mentality tests? 
   
-P-A-G-E-82
  64 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
To solve this problem Glass (5) used parts of three 
mentality tests for purposes of classification, namely, 
Chassell-Thorndike Graded Opposites Tests, Pintner 
Survey Scale, and the Otis Group Intelligence Tests. 
There was no difficulty in administering these for he 
reports these developments: “(1) There was no con- 
fusion in giving the tests; they were apparently as easily 
and naturally carried out as lesson tests by the classroom 
teacher. (2) Never more than one period was required. 
(3) There was no protest from teachers, pupils, or parents. 
(4) Pupils eagerly responded to tests. (5) There was no 
serious strain or excitement evident. (6) Teachers looked 
upon the tests as good exercises in concentration and 
attention in addition to their primary purpose. 
“At the end of the term a comparison was made of 
the test scores and teachers’ ratings covering the work 
of the half-year. The comparison showed a satisfactory 
general correlation with a small percentage of disagree- 
ment... .” 
The investigation became so promising that “The 
decision was reached to try the mental tests as the 
sole basis of classification of entering Grade VII B 
pupils . . .” with two objectives: first, the correlation 
of results from tests with school estimates; second, cor- 
relation with junior high school teachers’ estimates. In 
studying these objectives Glass states, “The correlation 
of test scores with junior high school estimates is very 
high . . .” and also “The correlation of test results and 
teachers’ ratings warranted the further use of tests as 
the primary method of selection.” 
In his final conclusion Glass expresses himself in 
accord with the idea of using mental tests for purposes 
of classification in the grammar grades on grounds that

their use makes possible a recognition of individual 
differences, makes possible curriculum adaptations to 
such differences and thus assures individual justice and 
an educational square deal. 
The above group of experiments and investigations 
corroborate Pintner (11) in this statement, “The com- 
parison of one pupil with another in reference to mental 
ability is the important thing because the chief practical 
value is the grouping of children into more or less 
homogeneous groups with reference to their mental 
ability. The more alike in general ability the pupils in 
any one class are, the easier and more effective will be 
the teaching of that group.” 
(h) Wood’s study was made with a failure class in 
algebra. (18) The class was given the Binet-Simon 
mentality tests. The intelligence quotients thus ob- 
tained and the class grades of the pupils in this group 
were compared and the author of this study reports 
that, “. .. there is a positive relation (+.6775 to 
+.993) between the algebraic ability of this class and 
their general intelligence.” Wood further adds, “Since 
there is a close relation between general intelligence and 
ability to learn algebra, it seems reasonable to conclude 
that the general intelligence of each pupil should be 
determined before he is required to take the subject. 
If he is clearly below normal in general intelligence, he 
should be prohibited from taking algebra unless there 
should be good reasons to the contrary.” 
(i) Dr. Briggs’ attempt at homogeneous grouping of 
junior high school pupils was made in 1915 at the Speyer 
experimental junior high school. A part of this experi- 
ment is reported by Trabue (16). Dr. Briggs is exten- 
*Page 161.
-P-A-G-E-84
  66 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
sively quoted in this excellent article and a few extracts, 
pertinent to our discussion, are here reproduced. Dr. 
Briggs says, “In fact, if I had to rely on the rank given 
a boy after two hours of testing or on the judgment of 
the average teacher who had him in class for five months, 
I should with little hesitation choose the results of the 
tests.” Dr. Briggs heartily recommends homogeneous 
grouping of pupils and comments as follows on the plan: 
“Tn no single instance have we felt that a pupil lost 
anything material by his classification; in the great 
majority of cases, the pupils were happier in their work 
and made better progress than they otherwise could have 
done. Some saved a year in their secondary school edu- 
cation, some a half-year, and some nothing at all; but 
none who remained a full two years (the elimination 
was very small) failed to be certified by their teachers 
as satisfactorily doing a full two year’s work. Gratifying 
results have been manifest in the teachers themselves: 
their work has been more interesting, they have had less 
strain, and they have felt better satisfied with the results 
than under the usual organization. All of them have 
testified that they never wish to return to a plan whereby 
the classification is fortuitous and the expected progress 
uniform.” 
Objections to homogeneous grouping —Among objectors 
Dr. Holmes (6), dean of the Harvard graduate school 
of education, points to the danger of skipping a grade or 
doing the work of two grades in one year. He believes 
that children will be promoted on the basis of mentality 
without reference to physical development and social 
maturity and also that children will be pushed through 
the course of study at the expense of enrichment and 
differentiation of school work. He believes that before 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
MENTALITY AND TEACHING 67 
making extra promotions the whole child should be taken 
into account and not mentality only. Health, com- 
panionship, and happy participation in the activities of 
his companions are considerations which should all be 
taken into account in dealing with every individual case. 
Almost all that Dr. Holmes says should be taken very 
seriously. 
Some Objections Answered.—In a homogeneous class are 
not pupils denied the opportunity to develop leader- 
ship as compared with such opportunity in an unselected 
group? If any such opportunity is denied it extends 
to the class-room only and ceases on the playground, in 
social organizations, and elsewhere outside of the class- 
room. Trabue (16) claims “that the rivalry for the 
leadership of one’s peers is keener than for the leadership 
of a miscellaneous group.” 
Do the slower pupils need the presence of the brighter 
ones as a stimulus? There is no absolute uniformity in 
a homogeneous group of children nor are the children 
in such a group so far removed from one another that 
the brightest are beyond the mental vision of the less 
gifted. 
Do the hard working pupils break down from over- 
work? It is urged by some that they do; but it is claimed 
by others that “break down” is caused by “late hours,” 
“social life” and other interests extraneous to school life. 
Intelligence Testing and Guidance.—Tests of intelligence 
can be used for purposes of guidance both educational 
and vocational. 
(a) Educational Guidance. Proctor (14) directed an 
experiment through which he tried to discover the prac- 
ticability of using intelligence tests for educational 
guidance and grouping of high school pupils according 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
68 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
to ability. Among other important observations made 
by Proctor on the basis of mental test results given in 
some California high schools, he summarizes in part as 
follows:1 “The possibility of predicting the success of 
high school pupils in their school tasks is illustrated 
by the record of elimination from the group of 107 
tested.” This elimination is discussed and he continues 
thus, “Even a rough mental diagnosis such as could 
have been secured by using one or more simple group 
tests, if applied at the beginning of the school year 
1916-17, would have enabled the advisers of that group 
of high school pupils to help them plan their courses 
of study to much greater advantage.” He showed that 
fewer educationally guided pupils leave school to go to 
work than those who receive no guidance, and that they 
fail less frequently. 
(b) Vocational Guidance. Kelly (8) recommends? 
that specialized tests be used for purposes of vocational 
guidance and such tests of course are necessary for 
guidance of a positive character. Mental tests, however, 
can be used negatively. Occupational intelligence stand- 
ards have been established through the use of mental 
tests given to vast numbers of soldiers during the World 
War. From such tests the table on the following page 
was compiled. 
Another compilation, more inclusive and differently 
arranged than this table, is submitted by Platt (18). 
See Graph XVI. 
With occupational intelligence standards established 
for many occupations in which men mostly engage, it 
should be relatively easy to give boys helpful aid in

The black horizontal lines show the scope of intelligence employed 
in certain occupations. The perpendicular mark shows the average

first results. Suppose the mental test results of the boy 
reveal low average ability and the boy aspires to be a 
civil engineer. Engineering is beyond his grasp, and he 
should be guided into the choice of some occupation, 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  MENTALITY AND TEACHING 71 
mental success in which is realizable by those persons 
with a low average intelligence. By consulting Graph XVI 
we see that his success in life is better assured by choos- 
ing from the occupations at the head of the list. On 
the other hand is a boy with a superior intelligence who 
chooses to be a blacksmith. His choice is poorly made 
and his instructors should guide him to choose from 
occupations like engineering (civil, electrical, etc.) or 
medicine. As there is no wisdom in choosing an occupa- 
tion beyond one’s mental grasp so there is poor judgment 
in choosing one which entails the waste of rich mental 
resources. 
Mental Tests Not Only Criteria for Guidance—As an edu- 
cational test should not be the only standard upon which 
promotions and classification of pupils are made, so 
mental tests should not be the exclusive ground upon 
which a child’s occupational fitness is determined. 
Intelligence Tests, Why Use Them?—The foregoing dis- 
cussion has largely answered the question. A brief 
summary is here attempted to show what some investi- 
gators and educators think of tests of mental ability. 
Callihan and Adler and others believe that tests make 
possible a prescription of full work for each individual 
in a class. Adler, Glass, Lippmann and Proctor believe 
in the reliability of tests for the classification of pupils. 
Terman recommends tests that the superior, average and 
the inferior children may be discovered. Lyman (9) 
sees their usefulness in promoting work in “opportunity” 
classes. Callihan, Glass, Pintner, Wilson and Hoke see 
in tests helps contributing to a scientific administration 
of minimal and enriched curricula. Adler and others 
utilize tests in suggesting diagnostic methods and saving 
the time of pupils. Briggs claims that results obtained  
-P-A-G-E-90
  72 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
from the use of mental tests are prompt and reliable. 
It may be added that mental tests are useful in a broad 
way, to determine vocational guidance. The combined 
mental-educational test, like Pintner’s Survey, reveals 
to the teacher whether the pupil’s mentality is conserved 
or wasted. 
Group and Individual Mental Tests. 
Binet-Simon Tests. A great service was rendered the 
educational world when, in 1904, Binet and Simon sub- 
mitted their mentality tests for use that the feebleminded 
might be scientifically designated and segregated accord- 
ing to requirements of legislation enacted in France. 
The original Binet-Simon Mentality Tests were revised 
and adapted by H. H. Goddard. Terman made a revision 
which is generally accepted as the best American revision 
of the Binet-Simon Tests. Though these tests are 
excellent they are not much used by teachers for two 
reasons: (1) a high degree of skill is needed to admin- 
ister them correctly and (2) the tests can be given to 
but one pupil at a time, the duration for giving the tests 
requiring about 30 to 90 minutes. These facts do not 
make the Binet-Simon tests practicable for class room 
purposes. However, in doubtful instances, the Terman 
Revision of the Binet-Simon Tests should be used. 
Group Mentality Tests. A more desirable test for 
school purposes than the individual test is one which 
can be given at the same time to a grade or several grades. 
Such a test is a group test. Several standardized group 
mentality tests have been devised to date. These are 
devised for grades 1 to 3, or 3 to 8, or 7 to 12, ete. 
The Detroit Kindergarten Test (21) is an individual 
test, that is, it is given to one pupil at a time. Such 
a test is desirable, inasmuch as children in the kinder-
-P-A-G-E-91
  MENTALITY AND TEACHING 73 
garten cannot take directions as a group sufficiently 
well to warrant using a group test with them. This test 
consists of eight parts. The first page provides blanks 
for data, such as school, date of test, etc. The complete 
test record is also transcribed to blank spaces on page 
one. The balance of the test pamphlet is devoted to 
pictures about which the child answers questions by 
pointing, or in some other way designating the answer. 
No writing is necessary on the pupil’s part. There is no 
time limit to this examination. A pupil completes the 
test in approximately ten minutes. 
The same general directions should be followed in 
using tests on kindergarten children as are suggested 
for other tests. The specific directions are: 
“1, Examiner should fill in required date in the heading before giv- 
ing the test. 
2. Mark with ordinary lead pencil whatever objects or object the 
pupil points to (except as noted later in Test 7). Do not allow the 
pupil to do the marking. 
8. Unless absolutely unavoidable, have no one present besides ex- 
aminer and pupil. 
4. Follow the printed directions under Test Procedure exactly. 
Repeat if necessary. 
5. Proceed with the test in a natural tone of voice and in a leisurely 
manner. Avoid being hurried by the pupil. 
6. Hold the book so that only one page shows. Best results are 
obtained when the examiner keeps the lower items on a page covered 
while those above are being given. 
7. A friendly and codperative attitude can be established with the 
child by asking if he would not like to look at some pictures.” 
Test Procedure. This should be followed implicitly. 
A part of the test follows: 
“The bold face type shows the directions that the 
teacher gives the pupil; remarks to the teacher are in 
parenthesis.

full in the “Manual of Directions.” The key to the

INSTRUCTIONS FoR TABULATION oF Resuuts. It is sug- 
gested that the examiner make a class record sheet on 
which can be entered information as follows: pupil’s 
name, age in years and months, the scores in various 
tests, and the total score. These data will be helpful in 
interpreting and using results. 
INTERPRETATION AND UsE or Resutts. The median 
score is 18. “. . . pupils making a score of about 12 
points or less will be placed in a slow-moving section and 
will, if necessary, remain longer than the traditional 
time in the kindergarten. Those making a score of 
about 23 points or higher will, if feasible, be advanced 
to the first grade more quickly than the traditional 
time would permit. The remaining central group will 
probably proceed at a rate which has been considered 
normal.” 
The authors of the test suggest that, “The score in 
this test or any other test should never be followed 
blindly. It should be used tentatively to indicate the 
group to which the pupil appears to belong. It is merely
-P-A-G-E-93
  MENTALITY AND TEACHING 75 
a starting point for further personal observation upon 
the part of the teacher, and any pupil should be given 
a trial in a different section if he shows evidence of 
belonging there.” 
Detroit Kindergarten Test in Practice. —This test was 
given to four groups of kindergarten children! with 
results as recorded in the table on the following page. 
In Table XIX (p. 76) pupil 4 was rated as best by the 
teacher in a group of five children. The same pupil 
received the best score on the Detroit test which was 26. 
Under the column labeled “Interpretation” the 1— 
means that the child’s ability is such as will necessitate 
his staying in the kindergarten less than one year. 
Pupil 2 in this group was rated as second best of two 
pupils both of which were rated as second best (2a, 2b). 
The test placed pupil 2 in the fourth place among these 
five pupils, receiving a score of 19 in the Detroit tests. 
Since 1 in the interpretation column appears after his 
number he should remain in the kindergarten a full year. 
The interpretation column designates whether the child 
should remain in the kindergarten less than a year 
(1 —) a full year (1), or more than a year (1+). Of 
the first twelve children, seven are eligible to promotion 
to grade one before the close of the school year; of the 
next twelve, eight are eligible to promotion before the 
close of the school year; of the last ten, five are eligible 
to an early promotion. Promotions should not be made 
on the basis of mentality only and the preceding recom- 
mendations would be modified by other considerations

such as health of the child and reasonable industry. 
After irregular promotions are made the child should 
by the quality of his work prove his right to retention 
in the grade to which he was promoted. 
The Pressey Primary Classification Test (26) is a group 
mentality test devised for the purpose of classifying 
children in grades one and two. The child in following 
the examiner’s directions is not required to do any writ- 
ing. Pencils are needed to cross out the answer. The 
procedure with each test is sufficiently illustrated that 
the pupils may know exactly what is expected of them. 
No time limit is required for Test 1 but the three suc- 
ceeding tests limit the pupils to two minutes to each 
test. Directions for giving the test are simple and they 
should be carefully followed by the examiner. Directions 
for scoring the test papers are also very explicit. 
Interpretation of test results.—“In studying the results 
the teacher should first note (1) the standing of the 
class as a whole; she should compare the median of her 
class with the grade norms. This will show her whether 
her class is, as a whole, unusually intelligent or dull. The 
teacher should now consider (2) the comparative stand- 
ing of the individual children in the class; special help 
should be given the unusually dull and the special oppor- 
tunity (as for double promotion) to the exceptionally 
bright if, after careful consideration of their cases, such 
special treatment seems warranted. Or, section divisions 
may be made on the basis of test results.” 
Test Norms.—“The norms presented below are based 
on approximately 1000 pupils to a grade or age and 
should be reliable. The testing on which these norms 
are based was done in May.

(It should be remembered in using these norms that 
22 is the norm for 51% years, not 5, etc., for the other 
ages, since in making the tabulations age at last birthday 
was used.) 
Children in primary grades find it difficult to take 
directions intelligently and to obey them without error. 
This is especially important in giving mental tests. A 
misunderstood direction militates strongly against ob- 
taining reliable results. Possibilities against errors in 
results can be avoided by testing small groups, say of 
eight to twelve pupils at a time, though the writer has 
tested successfully as many as thirty second grade chil- 
dren at a time. 
Kingsbury Primary Group Intelligence Scale (24).— 
This scale was devised by F. A. Kingsbury. As its name 
implies, this scale is intended for use with a group of 
children. It is devised for grades one to four, inclusive. 
It consists of four parts, namely, right answers, opposites, 
completion, and form. The first page of this scale pro- 
vides blanks for the usual data called for in tests. In 
addition, space is provided for the pupil’s score, mental 
and chronological ages and the (I. Q.) intelligence 
quotient. Chronological age means age in years and 
months from the time of birth. The mental age is the 
mentality of a child. Mental age may be above average, 
average or below average. It is scientifically determined 
through the application of a mentality test and is ex-
-P-A-G-E-97
  MENTALITY AND TEACHING 79 
pressed in years and months, so we say that a child’s 
mental age is five years and two months or ten years 
and eight months. Rarely are the chronological and 
mental ages equal. The chronological age of a boy may 
be eight years and two months whereas his mental age 
may be nine years and one month. The ratio between 
the mental age and chronological age is designated as the 
intelligence quotient, I. Q. To obtain the intelligence 
quotient the ages are first resolved to months. To find 
the intelligence quotient of the boy mentioned in the 
illustration divide his mental age of 109 months by the 
chronological age of 98 months. His intelligence quotient 
is 111+. The decimal point is disregarded in stating 
an intelligence quotient. 
The Kingsbury Scale requires the use of a pamphlet of 
instructions. “The examiner should familiarize himself 
thoroughly with these instructions before giving the test. 
It is extremely important that the time allowance for 
each test be rigidly observed. Do not allow one second 
of variation in the time. Failure to keep time allow- 
ance with precision destroys the possibility of comparison 
of scores with any other groups, and may invalidate 
comparison within the group itself, by allowing slow 
children to continue and catch up after quick children 
have finished, thus concealing differences which really 
exist. Don’t expect pupils to get through in the time 
allowed, or even to get far along. The time has pur- 
posely been made so short that very few third grade 
children can finish parts II, III and IV in the time 
allowed.” (241) 
The instructions couched in simple language are very

specific and no trouble need be experienced in under- 
standing them. 
The face of the class record sheet contains a distri- 
bution table and directions for distributing the scores. 
The reverse side is filled with important help in find- 
ing mental ages and intelligence quotients. 
Age standards for translating point scores into mental ages. 
Age in Years Median Point Score 
  Quoting again, “If the pupil’s point score is 22, his 
mental age is 6% years; if his point score is 46, his 
mental age is 814 years. Since the increase in the score 
for the 714 year old group over the 6% year old group 
is 12 points, one may consider within this interval that 
an increase of one point means an increase of one month 
in mental age. Therefore, a pupil having a score of 28 
would be 6% years, plus 6 months or 7 years old men- 
tally. The same statement applies to the interval 
between the ages of 744 and 8%. It does not apply 
between 814 and 91% since the increase for this interval 
is only 10 points.” In determining mental age between 
46 and 56 point scores an increase of 5/6 of a point equals 
one month. There are no available data for translating 
point scores below 22 or above 56 into corresponding 
mental ages.

In this test several of the pupils, numbered 21 to 26, 
inclusive, obtained point scores beyond 56. Since these 
scores are too high for comparative purposes it was 
necessary to subject these pupils to a mental test de- 
signed for older children. Therefore, pupils 21 to 26 
were retested with the Illinois General Intelligence Scale, 
with results as tabulated below:

  The median point score of the pupils in Table XX is 
52. The tentative standard for Grade III is 47. The 
class as a whole is correctly classified from the standpoint 
of mentality considering the point scores only. Several 
pupils, numbered 21-26, obtained point scores entitling 
them, if other conditions were favorable, to classification 
as fourth graders since they received point scores of 60 
to 69. The median fourth grade point score is 58. How- 
ever, in Table XX pupils 21-26 found the test too easy 
being adapted to children of lesser ability and the I. Q.’s 
of these pupils appear unusually high. This observation 
was checked up by giving them the Illinois General 
Intelligence Scale which is designed for pupils in grades 
three to eight inclusive. Their efforts are recorded in 
Table XXI.

vised in Forms 1 and 2, each of equal difficulty, The

test sheets contain blanks for data, such as name, age, 
etc., also for the scores on each test, the (M. A.) mental 
age, and (I. Q.) intelligence quotient. Full directions to 
pupils are printed on each page preceding the respective 
test for which they are intended. The several tests are 
on analogies, arithmetic problems, sentences, vocabulary, 
substitution, verbal ingenuity, arithmetical ingenuity, 
and synonym and antonym. Correct answers to each 
test are printed on the edges of an answer card making 
the answers to each exercise exactly match each part of 
the test. 
“Except in Tests 4 and 7, the pupil’s score is the num- 
ber of exercises he has done correctly.” In Test 4, the 
number right divided by 4 is the score; in Test 7, the 
difference between the rights and wrongs is the score. 
The sum of the scores on all the exercises is the point 
score. The point score is of no immediate consequence 
but it must be determined in order to find the intelligence 
quotient (I. Q.). 
The mental age and the intelligence quotient of each 
pupil can be solved by the examiner but to avoid many 
calculations the authors of the scale submit a table in 
the Teacher’s Handbook! through the use of which the 
examiner can tell at a glance the mental age, the intelli- 
gence quotient or the coefficient of brightness (C. B.) of 
each pupil taking the test. The use of this table is clearly 
explained.

From the standpoint of classification it is significant 
that the older pupils, chronologically, are not as well 
fitted for promotion as are some of the younger children 
who have a high intelligence quotient. Note the next

  The differences between the two sections of this third 
grade will be discussed in another chapter. 
Terman Group Test of Mental Ability (27) is used with 
grades seven to twelve inclusive, and it may be used 
with first year college students. The test consists of ten 
parts as follows: (1) information, (2) best answer, 
(3) word meaning, (4) logical selection, (5) arithmetic, 
(6) sentence meaning, (7) analogies, (8) mixed sen- 
tences, (9) classification, (10) number series. The 
author of this test is known for the Terman Revision of 
the Binet-Simon Mentality Test. 
The Terman Group Test is reduced in size so the 
student’s power rather than speed is tested, hence, for 
economy of time in procedure the test is arranged so it 
can be given to a class in thirty-five minutes. The pupil 
does very little writing. A Manual of Directions and a 
scoring key accompany the test. The directions are 
simple and can be mastered in a short time. 
Giving the Tests—Before giving the tests the printed 
directions should be carefully studied in order that the 
personal factor may be reduced to a minimum. Cer- 
tain general directions are recommended for observance 
such as not allowing the use of pens, impressing the  
-P-A-G-E-104
  86 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
pupils with the test as an ordinary event, restricting ask- 
ing of questions, following directions verbatim, allowing 
no supplementary explanations or remarks of any kind, 
and rigid adherence to time limits. There are specific 
directions which should be followed verbatim. These 
constitute the test procedure.? 
Scoring the tests is simplified by the use of keys. The 
keys for test Form A are different from the keys for 
test Form B. These keys are printed on a large sheet 
of paper and should be detached from each other before 
use. The directions for using the key to Test 1, Infor- 
mation, are printed on the reverse side of the key. By 
observing these and matching the answers on the key 
with those submitted by the pupil, the scoring is done 
with ease and facility. At the bottom of each key are 
brief directions for counting “number right” and the 
score, which is entered in the place provided for it in 
a table on the first page of the test. The total score of 
the ten items in the Terman Group Test is the percentile 
score. 
Grade standards for August, based on over 30,600 tests, 
are submitted. 
. Grade 7 8 9 10 11 12

The standard is the median percentile score by grades 
regarding which Terman says, “. . . attention is called 
to the fact that a pupil’s percentile rank within his grade 
is not an accurate index of brightness, since it does not 
take age into account.” No age percentile values are 
available but the author of the test offers for use a table 
of mental age equivalents given below.

  Finding the I. Q—After the test is given and scored 
the percentile score is obtained. This score with the use 
of Table XXIV enables the examiner to find the mental 
age of the child. With these data and the chronological 
age of the pupil it is possible to find the intelligence 
quotient. For solving I. Q. see the Kingsbury Primary 
Group Test. 
Using Results of Test—Terman, Otis, Buckingham, 
Monroe and others are agreed that mental ability should 
be the fundamental basis for all grading, classification, 
and promotion of students. Their significant views are 
worthy of serious consideration. “The purpose of 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
88 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
(mental) tests is to make a difference in the educational 
treatment of the pupils, not to gratify a mere idle curi- 
osity regarding their intellectual status.” 
Terman Group Test in Practice—This group mental 
test was given to an algebra class. From the test results 
were derived the mental and chronological ages of all the 
students in the class, also their intelligence quotients. 
The class was also given the Hotz Algebra test. The 
examination grades earned by students in algebra in their 
final examination were obtained from the mathematics 
teacher in charge of the class. This information regard-

ing the mental and academic ability of the class was 
assembled in tabular form, Table XXV. 
Question: Which affects algebraic ability more mate- 
rially, the chronological age or the I. Q. of students? 
Information obtained from the Terman test results, 
the Hotz test results and the teacher’s final examination 
grades was arranged in order according to the descending 
value of the intelligence quotient of the members in the 
class. Evidently the first half of the students in Table 
XXV have a higher I. Q. than those in the last half (see 
Table XXVI), their median I. Q. being 17.75 higher. 
They obtain a higher median score on the Hotz test than 
the latter group and also a higher examination average. 
The last thirteen students received lower median marks

except that their median chronological age is three 
months greater. Table XXVI indicates that within a class, 
ability to perform work in algebra does not rise and fall 
with an increase or drop in chronological age, if the class 
is of high school age. The main measurable factor 
denoting the kind of work which can be expected of 
students is their mentality as measured by the I. Q. 
Industry certainly is another factor, however, of little 
consequence if talent is wanting. 
The younger students got better grades than the older 
ones by approximately 11 per cent. There were but two 
exceptions to this statement. (See students 23, 29, 
Table XXV.) It is probable that with proper encourage- 
ment, and their desire to forge ahead, five students in 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  90 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
this class could complete the fifteen hour algebra credits 
in about seven months. To this end they should be given 
at least as much special help as the poor students get. 
Farmers do not cultivate swamps intensively and their 
richest lands but scantily; miners do not forsake rich 
veins to spend a major part of their time on low yielding 
veins. Public schools should not neglect the poorer 
students but surely they should give due emphasis to 
cultivating especial ability. 
Otis Group Intelligence Scale—(25) This is one of the 
first scales devised for measuring the intelligence of 
groups of students. This scale, like most others, tests 
general, not specific, mental ability. Though it may dis- 
cover geniuses, it does not presume to designate the 
particular field in which they excel; nor is this necessary 
for general public school purposes. 
The Primary Examination of this scale, prepared for 
grades from the kindergarten through the fourth, inclu- 
sive, is published in Forms A and B. The Advanced 
Examination, prepared for grades five to twelve inclusive, 
and even beyond to include university students, is also 
distributed in Forms A and B. The two forms for each 
examination serve several purposes. Coaching for the 
tests is thereby more readily eliminated. Retesting of 
a pupil or a class is made possible shortly after the first 
test is given, without impairing the results of the second 
test. 
Description of Otis Scale—(a) Primary Examination. 
The front page of this examination pamphlet contains 
blank spaces for necessary information, such as, name, 
age, grade, etc., of the examinee. The lower part of this

  centile Rank (P. R.). The exercises in the Primary 
Examination require the use of a pencil to mark the 
answers but neither spelling of words nor writing of 
sentences is required of children. 
(b) Advanced Examination. The blanks for pre- 
liminary data on the first page of this pamphlet are 
almost identical with those on the Primary Examina- 
tion. The pupil is subjected to ten tests in the Advanced 
Examination. Very little writing is required in answer- 
ing the directions of the examiner giving these tests. 
Administration and Scoring.—Full directions for giving 
the Otis Scale, Forms A, B, are published in a “Manual 
of Directions for Primary and Advanced Examinations” 
(1921 Revision). The scoring of the scale in either form 
is also fully explained in this manual. 
Norms.—The norms with which the products of the 
examinations are measured are very complete. Their

nature is disclosed in Table XXVII. The norm for the 
Advanced Examination is devised after the same general 
lan. 
: National Intelligence Tests. —(19), (23) During the 
World War over 1,000,000 mental tests were given to 
the American soldiers with a view to determining more 
reliably their fitness for various fields of war service. 
The general success of the Army Alpha Intelligence Ex- 
amination led to a movement which hoped to adapt the 
method of the army examination to the examination of 
school children. A committee of five prominent educa- 
tors, Messrs. Haggerty, Terman, Thorndike, Whipple 
and Yerkes, was detailed for this work. 
The aim of this committee was “to produce in a single 
pamphlet an arrangement of tests that could be applied 
to any child in the elementary school who could read 
well enough to participate in a group examination.” 
This pamphlet, known as the National Intelligence Tests, 
is devised for use in grades three to eight, inclusive. 
The items within each test vary in difficulty so that some 
can be answered by all the pupils and others by only 
a few. 
In order that no prospective examinee can prepare 
for the National Intelligence Test by coaching, the test 
is devised in two scales, A and B, each of equal difficulty 
and either of which may be used. Further forms of each 
test are in preparation. At this writing there are on 
the market two forms, Form 1 and Form 2 of each scale, 
making in all four examinations advertised as available 
for use. Other forms are in process of completion. In 
commenting on the futility of coaching in preparation 
for the taking of this test Whipple (19) says, “. . . if 
*Page 20.
-P-A-G-E-111
  
MENTALITY AND TEACHING 93 
we suppose that our five experimentally equalized forms 
of each scale are in print and that a prospective examinee 
should really sit down to prepare himself in advance to 
cope with any form that might be put before him, he 
would have to drill himself on the following: 
1. 80 examples in arithmetic. 
100 sentence completions. 
120 logical selections. 
200 synonym-antonyms. 
40 symbol-digit associations (which conflict with one another). 
110 arithmetical computations, 
200 pieces of information. 
200 vocabulary items. 
160 analogies. 
250 same-or-different comparisons.” PL WAS ou ie ge bo _ 
Administration and Scoring.—With very little study in 
test giving teachers can learn how to give the National 
Intelligence Tests. They can be given within a single 
forty-minute period. Each test is preceded by a fore- 
exercise, the working of which acquaints the examinee 
with the nature of the next succeeding exercise. Scor- 
ing is facilitated by the fact that a minimum of writing 
is entailed in the responses. A Manual of Directions, 
together with supplement to same, contain full instruc- 
tions for giving the test and for scoring the results. 
For the latter purpose a stencil and a key are also 
supplied.

EDUCATIONAL SURVEY SCALES 
Questions 
1. Should mental age be considered in classifying pupils by grades? 
2. What appear to you to be the quickest means of determining 
whether your class is well graded? 
3. One fourth grade has a lower median in reading than a corre- 
sponding grade in a nearby school. Which grade is better taught? 
Why do you think so? 
4. Given two classes in the same grade. One class has a high men- 
tality median, the other a low median. Teacher A obtains average 
academic results from the former class and teacher B, slightly lower 
than average results from the latter class. Which is the better teacher? 
Educational Survey Fields—The words, educational 
survey, convey to mind an elaborate investigation -em- 
bodying suggestive and constructive policies for the 
betterment of the surveyed field. A variety of surveys 
have been made in public schools. Dr. Foght directed 
state and provincial surveys in Alabama, South Dakota, 
Saskatchewan, and elsewhere. Dr. Allen directed a 
survey of the University of Wisconsin; Dr. Hanus, the 
New York School Inquiry of 1911-1913; Dr. Judd, the 
Cleveland Survey. Men like E. C. Elliott, Strayer, 
Thorndike and others have directed or assisted in mak- 
ing school surveys. Many cities—Gary, Binghamton, 
Paterson, Boise, Memphis and others—have been sur- 
veyed. 
The survey field concerning us here is that which 
includes the one room rural school and the single room 
96 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
SURVEY SCALES 97 
of a village or city school system. It would be proper 
in making such a survey to evaluate the room. For this 
purpose the writer devised score cards some years ago, 
one for the evaluation of a rural school (4e), and one 
for the evaluation of a single room in a city school 
system (4d). Each of these cards distributes the total 
possible room perfection among one thousand points. 
Other fields than the school room might be surveyed, 
such as the school community, school finances, and school 
population. However, from the viewpoint of diagnostic 
teaching these aspects of school survey are less conse- 
quential than the quality of instruction as revealed in 
the teaching product, therefore, the product will engage 
our especial attention. 
Age-grade Census.—The teacher should use some gen- 
eral measure by which to determine whether her pupils 
are well graded from the chronological standpoint. For 
this purpose she can construct an age-grade table which 
gives a full census of her pupils. This table gives, by 
chronological ages only, the pupils in her room who are 
retarded, accelerated and at standard. Such a table is 
presented on page 98. 
Table XXVIII gives the ages of pupils in the several 
grades of an elementary school. The age at which chil- 
dren are generally admitted into grade one is six years; 
and, if the progress from grade to grade is normal, at 
seven years of age the child should be in grade two, at 
eight in grade three, and so on. In many studies of 
age-grade distributions, six years is interpreted to in- 
clude the five and seven year olds; seven years, to include 
six and eight year olds, etc. Of course, the more lenient 
the interpretation the fewer overage and underage chil- 
dren will be reported in a school; and, at the same time,

  there will be a relatively a a of children whose 
progress is reported as normal. Adhering to a rigid 
interpretation of what constitutes pupil progress, pupils 
within the squares in Table XXVIII constitute the 
normal group. All numbers below the square and in 
the same column represent retarded pupils; numbers 
above the square stand for accelerated pupils. There- 
fore, of the 32 pupils in grade one, 11 are making normal 
progress; 4 are accelerated one year; 9 are retarded one 
year; 5 are retarded two years; 3 are retarded three 
years. An age-grade census shows at a glance the num- 
ber of accelerated normal and retarded pupils in a grade 
or a school system, as well as the total enrollment by 
chronological ages and grades. All children retarded two 
or more years should become a matter of especial concern 
to the teacher and to the superintendent. 
Retardation in Wisconsin.—A study of overage-children

(8) was made by the State Department of Education in 
Wisconsin. The results were surprising and no doubt are 
duplicated by many states if the figures were available 
for comparison. The Wisconsin study discloses “overage 
in grades in the schools—(exclusive of rural schools) for 
the year 1913-1914” as follows:

With such appalling numbers of overage children, the 
problem of retardation is a serious one. As a remedy 
for overage, Miss Rankin suggests good instruction, good 
attendance, good discipline, individual instruction, 
summer, or vacation schools, ungraded rooms, good 
supervision, health supervision, reasonable sized classes, 
flexible system of promotion, codperation between home 
and school, revision of course of study (in some cases), 
and willingness on teacher’s part to promote. 
A most important remedy for diminishing the overage 
and underage school population is the abolition of pupil 
classification by chronological age, and a substitution 
therefor of classification by mental age or intelligence 
quotient. The writer prefers classification by the I. Q.,

by chronological age. It is maintained that in general 
a pupil can do the work of the grade corresponding to 
his mental age or I. Q. (1, 2, 9) and this fact justifies the 
new basis of classification.
-P-A-G-E-119
SURVEY SCALES 101 
Intelligence Quotient—Grade Census.— As Table 
XXVIII shows at a glance the number of overage and 
underage, a similar table can be made to show the intelli- 
gence of pupils, their school grade, and the correctness or 
incorrectness of their classification as compared with 
their intelligence quotient. See Table XXX. The tabula- 
tion shows that of the 30 pupils in grade three, 1 has an 
I. Q. of 69, 1 an I. Q. of 107 and the other 28 pupils have 
I. Q.’s ranging between these numbers. The classifica- 
tion is made after the Illinois Examination stand- 
ard (3).1 
Mental-educational Survey—An age-grade census and 
an I. Q.-age census are surveys of great value. In using 
the same pupils are classified on the basis of age or 
intelligence only. Such classifications are relatively 
imperfect because they are relatively incomplete. They 
need to be supplemented with a more specific device 
which is at the same time a truer index of the work done 
in the school as based upon the mental ability of the 
child and the quality of his school product. This truer 
indicator is a mental-educational survey. Two mental 
educational surveys have been devised to date—one the 
Pintner Non-Language Mental and Educational Survey 
Tests (6), another the Illinois Examination I and II (3). 
Pintner Non-Language Mental and Educational Survey 
Tests——(6) The outstanding feature of this survey test 
is the discovery of wasted intelligence in the classroom 
with consequent possibility of utilizing it. Dr. Pintner 
suggests that a child should do work in school appropri- 
ate to his mental capacity. He says, “We have a right 
to expect that: 
*Page 29, Teachers Handbook. 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  102 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
The very bright child should do very good work for his 
age. 
The bright child should do good work for his age. 
The normal child should do average work for his age. 
The backward child should do poor work for his age. 
The dull child should do very poor work for his age. 
Pintner makes possible the discovery of wasted intelli- 
gence through a double measurement of each child. The 
class is measured for educational ability, also for mental 
ability. The educational results are manipulated so as 
to reduce them to an index. The index is expressed 
numerically, the highest education index is 100. The 
mental findings are also reduced to an index which 
does not exceed 100. The indices, both expressed in 
equal numerical terms, are thus made easily comparable. 
If a child receives a higher educational than mental 
index, he represents a type of pupil that utilizes to 
advantage his schoolroom opportunities; if his mental 
index is well above the educational index, he may exert 
himself to greater activity. The conservation of mental 
resources is thus made possible through the reduction 
of mental ability and educational effort to a common 
numerical standard on the basis of 100 points. 
A technical discussion of the background for such 
comparisons is fully given elsewhere (7). Occasionally, 
an attack is made upon this method of comparing results, 
the claim being that highly important conclusions regard- 
ing children should not be made merely on the basis of 
comparing numbers representing indices. In the first 
place, it is not recommended that important conclusions 
be made from the results obtained by studying mental 
and educational ability only to the exclusion of other
-P-A-G-E-121
  SURVEY SCALES 103 
considerations. In the next place, no more important 
results are reached through the use of indices than are 
reached by physicians in diagnosing patient’s ailments 
through the use of numerical results indicated on a 
clinical thermometer. The clinical thermometer still 
remains the physician’s necessary diagnostic instrument. 
Description of Pintner Survey Tests—The Pintner 
Combined Mental and Educational Survey Tests con- 
sist of two parts, namely the Non-Language Mental 
Test and the Educational Tests. The Non-Language 
Mental Test consists of six exercises designed to measure 
the child’s mentality. The Educational Survey Tests 
consist of tests in vocabulary, arithmetic, reading, lan- 
guage, grammar and punctuation, geography and history. 
The arithmetic is taken from the Woody arithmetic tests; 
the reading, from the Kelley and the Thorndike reading 
tests; the language, from the Trabue Completion 
Tests; the punctuation and grammar, from the Starch’s 
punctuation and grammar tests; the geography, from 
the Hahn-Lackey Geography Scale; and the history, 
from the Von Wagenen History Tests. 
Using the Tests—The Pintner Combined Mental 
Educational Survey Tests are standardized for grades 
three to eight, inclusive. They can be administered to 
one or several grades at a time. This makes them 
especially useful for use in rural schools or in rooms 
housing several grades. The time for giving both tests 
is one hour. At the option of the examiner the mental 
phase of the test may be given at one time and the 
educational phase at another time. However, the tests 
should not be given more than five days apart. Full 
directions for administering the tests are printed in the 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  104 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
Manual of Directions (6). This Manual also contains 
directions for scoring which are very simple. 
Evaluating Results—After the educational test is 
marked, the examiner obtains an educational score which, 
through the use of Table I in the Manual of Directions, is 
resolved into an educational index. This index is desig- 
nated numerically from 1 to 100. Next the mental test- 
results are marked, the total marks giving rise to a mental 
score. The mental score, through the use of Table II 
in the Manual of Directions, is resolved into a mental 
index. The indices, mental and educational, are recorded 
in blanks provided for that purpose on the first page of 
the Non-Language Test. The mental index, designated 
numerically from 1 to 100, is subtracted from the educa- 
tional index. This difference value enables the examiner 
to interpret the child’s work by using the following table:

  If a child has an educational index between 40 and 59, 
we say he is doing average educational work for his age, 
or in other words he belongs among the middle fifty 
per cent of children of that age. If his mental index is 
between 60 and 79, he is mentally bright, ie., belongs 
to the upper 23 per cent of children. Since his educa- 
tional index is exceeded by the mental index we not only 
know that further exertion on the child’s part is possible 
but also know how much more exertion can fairly be

expected through the use of the subsequent table. See 
Table XXXII. 
Difference Ratings—The remainder obtained by sub- 
tracting the mental index from the educational index 
gives plus or minus differences. A frequency distribution 
of 4303 cases gives a fivefold grouping of differences

  “The difference (6) between the educational and 
mental indices shows us the relation between the mental 
ability and educational attainment of the child. A plus 
difference shows that the child is doing better work than 
children of his mentality usually accomplish. Such 
children are doing well—better than average—regardless 
of how low their educational index may be. Do not 
push them harder. They are making more than average 
use of the mental ability they possess. A minus differ- 
ence shows that a child is not doing as good work 
educationally as he is capable of doing as judged by 
his mentality. Differences from -++ 8 through 0 to —8 
are probably not very significant. Fifty per cent of our 
cases fall between these two points. All children with 
minus differences greater than — 8 should be carefully 
studied to see why they are not doing work more nearly 
commensurate with their ability. They may be very 
bright or normal or dull children mentally, but they are 
all alike in that they are not working up to capacity. 
The reasons for this may be laziness, lack of interest,

poor teaching, grade misplacement, lack of stimulus at 
home, and the like. These are the cases where we have 
wasted intelligence. Study them carefully. Eliminate 
this waste from your school system. Organize coaching 
classes. These children have mental ability that is not 
being used. It will pay to put it to use.” + 
“Practical (6) Suggestions in the Use of Survey Results. 
—When school or classes or individual children show a 
high minus difference, investigate. There is waste of in- 
telligence. Conserve it. : 
Establish a coaching teacher for all children showing 
a Difference of — 9 and above. 
Skip all children to the next higher grade who show a 
Mental Index of 80 or higher together with an Educa- 
tional Index Grade of 80 or higher, because these indices 
show that the child has good native ability and is also 
doing splendid work for the grade he is studying. 
Consider seriously for acceleration or skipping all 
children whose Mental Index is 60 to 79 and whose Edu- 
cational Index Grade is also above 60, because these 
children have good native ability and are also doing 
good work for the grade they are studying. 
Divide your classes if possible more evenly in regard 
to mental and educational ability. 
Do not force the child of poor native ability too much. 
He is the most industrious and accelerated pupil in our 
schools to-day. 
Accelerate and skip the bright child freely. He is the 
laziest and most retarded pupil in our schools to-day.” ?

making reclassifications of pupils. While occasionally

—The Pintner Survey tests were administered by the 
writer with the assistance of practice teachers under his 
supervision, in codperation with the critic teachers, to the 
pupils of the Urban Practice School of the State 
Teachers College (Aberdeen) at the opening of the 1922 
summer session. The tests were scored, the indices of 
the pupils were then estimated and the median indices, 
both educational and mental, were figured. The result- 
ing figures are tabulated below:

  These figures are represented in Graph XVII. Since the 
dots are medians a small difference of even 3 or 4 is 
significant. 
Grades IV and V show marked differences which de- 
note to the respective teachers of these grades that much 
more effort can be obtained from each of these grades 
than is being realized. Speaking of these two grades as 
wholes the teachers can expect of them better prepara- 
tion and give to them longer assignments. It would be 
meet to study the individual differences between the 
mental and educational indices of each member of 
grades IV and V in order to determine a more specific 
procedure. Such diagnosis is left to a later discussion 
in this chapter. The above study suggests a possible 
procedure for a superintendent or supervising principal 
to observe in his work.

show positive differences; grades V and VI show negative 
differences. Very: small differences, either positive or 
negative, in comparing class medians of mental and 
educational indices, need be of little concern to either 
the grade teacher or the supervisor. Negative differences 
exceeding three should be studied and the cause there- 
fore ascertained. The differences for grades VI and VII 
are pronounced and call for careful diagnosis of these 
grades with a view to taking remedial steps. 
Diagnostic and Remedial Measures for Grade VI—This 
grade has a — 6.04 difference. It is, therefore, not con- 
serving fully the mental ability of the pupils enrolled. 
The class is large, consisting of forty pupils. The teacher 
divides her time between this large group of pupils and 
the fifth grade. Insufficient help is partly responsible 
for the minus difference. A graphic representation of 
this grade will further assist in locating the exact status 
of the pupils in this class. 
Let us examine Graph XIX on the following page. 
Table XXXII, page 105, intimates that —8 to +8 
differences include the pupils who reasonably live up to 
their mental ability. Such pupils ordinarily constitute 
53.5 per cent of the entire class. The pupils included 
between the broken lines running almost parallel to each 
other and diagonally across Graph XIX are doing aver- 
age work commensurate with their mental ability. A 
second and large group of pupils are located on the minus 
side of the broken line. A third group, consisting of 
four pupils, live up to high expectations of their ability. 
In a further diagnosis of these three groups it is neces- 
sary to bear in mind the practical suggestions and 
caution discussed previously (p. 106). 
Average Group.—These pupils should be studied under

    112 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
three divisions, the first consisting of pupils who fall at 
or below 40 in mental and educational indices. Of such 
there are three in number. They are doing poor work 
since their mental and educational indices are at or 
below 40. (Table XXXI.) Unless physical conditions, 
’ such as poor eyesight or undernourishment, interfere 
with their progress, but little more can be expected of 
them than what they are doing. Special coaching, were 
there time for it, would bring meagre results. 
A second division of the average group consists of 
those pupils whose mental and educational indices are 
between 40 and 59. (Table XXXI.) These pupils are 
doing average work for their mental ability and average 
work for the grade wherein they are classified. They 
constitute no particular problem. 
A third division within the average group in this class 
consists of four pupils whose indices are above 59 and 
below 80. These are bright pupils doing good work for 
this grade and should be encouraged, for some of these 
may become fit candidates for acceleration or skipping. 
The advisability of skipping is discussed in the chapter 
on mentality. 
Minus-differences Group—This includes the pupils 
whose minus differences are above —8. They consist 
of 16 pupils and constitute 40 per cent of the class. 
This is a large number and corrective measures wisely 
applied here will materially raise the class standard. 
These pupils will be discussed under two divisions. 
Each division should be urged to greater academic effort. 
These pupils have the mental ability to deliver decidedly 
better work. Some may lack in health. To the extent 
that they do, they are fit subjects about which to consult 
the county nurse. Some are lazy and ambitionless. 
These should be taught industrious habits and should
-P-A-G-E-131
SURVEY SCALES 113 
be spurred with an ambition to excel for which their 
ability will give proper rewards. Incentives can be very 
profitably used. Consultation with the parents of this 
group of pupils will bring further desirable results. 
The first division of these pupils, whose indices range 
between 40 and 59, inclusive, can, with one exception, 
IK, improve their work materially. These ten should 
be rigidly held to assignments. They show ability in 
certain subjects and weakness in others. This fact sug- 
gests remedial procedure. 
The second division includes four pupils whose indices 
range between 60 and 79. The same corrective measures 
should be used upon them as on the first division. They 
have more at stake, inasmuch as exertion on their part 
would probably make them eligible to extra promotion. 
While one feature of the corrective measures to use 
with this group is more efficient academic instruction, 
another is the injection of ambition to excellence in work. 
Plus-difference Group.—This is a small group working 
to full capacity, perhaps. Other conditions, like health, 
strength, industry being favorable, at least one of these 
pupils, EA, is entitled to extra promotion since he meas- 
ures up to the highest expectations of academic work. 
The remaining three of this group need no urging from 
the teacher. 
A diagnosis of grade VII would follow the same gen- 
eral principles, although conclusions and remedial 
measures would be different from those which were 
drawn for grade VI.

by grades, then scored and the educational and mental 
indices were noted in the blank spaces assigned for that 
purpose. The test results of seventeen children who 
reported for both tests were graphed. See Graph XX. 
When there are but few pupils in each grade, as is likely 
to be the case in a rural school, one graph will do for 
all the grades. The numbers above pupils’ initials desig- 
nate the grade in which the pupil is classified. 
Diagnosis and Remedial Measures.—In presenting this 
phase of the Pintner test-results heretofore, no complete 
analysis was attempted in discussing data obtained from 
the Urban Practice and the Sacred Heart Schools. The 
diagnosis was partial, in each instance, so that each 
analytic feature might stand out more prominently 
because of its isolation. The previously used diagnostic 
and remedial measures will not be employed in observing 
results from the Campus School. Still a third type of 
diagnosis is possible. 
Problem: Judging from mental and educational re- 
sults only, are the pupils in this rural school well 
classified? 
By comparing the educational index of each child with 
Table XXX of the Pintner Manual of Directions, we 
measure the children by the grade standards. These 
comparisons yield the results tabulated below. 
Pupil 2 is eligible for promotion into grade IV in 
which she could do strong work as is indicated by the 
plus sign. Pupils 9 and 13 are also qualified for promo- 
tion. One sixth grade pupil, 16, will do good work in 
grade VII. Three eighth grade pupils, 12, 16, 14, are a 
grade ahead of where they belong. Pupil 17 is almost 
eligible to promotion into grade IX.

should be used in analyzing the condition of any single 
grade. The presentation was made in separate steps so 
as to simplify the work for an amateur in testing. 
Criticism of Pintner Survey Tests.—It would be highly 
desirable if standards were established in each of the 
subjects for each grade to which this survey test is 
administered. This would give us standards in arith- 
metic for each grade from III to VIII inclusive. It 
would give like standards on the vocabulary, reading, 
geography, history, grammar and punctuation and the 
composition completion tests. Such standards would 
yield even greater possibilities of diagnostic and remedial 
measures attainable from the Pintner Tests. Neverthe-

less, it appears that the Pintner Tests are the best single 
test now on the market for all around purposes. 
The Illinois Examination I and II.—(3). Examination I 
is designed for grades III, IV and V; Examination II, 
for grades VI, VII and VIII. Each Examination con- 
sists of a mental and an educational feature. The 
mental feature consists of seven sets of exercises; the 
educational feature includes the Monroe’s Standardized 
Silent Reading Tests (Revised) and Monroe’s General 
Survey Scale in Arithmetic. The child’s achievement 
is interpreted in terms of both mental and educational 
efforts. The Illinois Examination I and II, like the 
Pintner Survey Tests, is appropriate for use in both 
rural and city schools; however, they cannot be as con- 
veniently administered. “The Group Intelligence Scale 
is the same for all grades. Consequently, it may be 
given to an entire room regardless of the grade to which 
the pupils belong. The silent reading tests are different 
but the directions and the time limits are the same; 
consequently, they may be given to the entire room 
regardless of the grade to which the pupils belong. The 
arithmetic tests, however, are different and the instruc- 
tions, particularly the time limits, are different. Conse- 
quently, pupils belonging to grades VI, VII, VIII must 
be tested separately in arithmetic from those belonging 
to grades III, IV, and V.”* (3) 
Monroe’s Standardized Silent Reading Test, Revised.— 
This test is fully discussed in the chapter, “Diagnosis 
in Reading.” 
Monroe’s General Survey Scale in Arithmetic—This 
scale is discussed in the chapter, “Diagnosis in Arith- 
metic.”

  118 DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES 
The idea of combining these two educational tests with 
the mentality test is to resolve the academic ability of 
pupils into a numerical unit—achievement quotient 
(A. Q.)—so that the comparisons of pupil accomplish- 
ment will be made on an identical unit, and with com- 
parative ease. 
Question: How can we obtain the achievement 
quotient? 
To get the achievement quotient it is necessary to 
observe steps as follows: 
1. Administer the Illinois General Intelligence Scale. 
2. Administer the Monroe Reading Test, Revised, if working for 
an A. Q. in reading or administer the Monroe General Survey Scale 
in arithmetic if working for an A. Q. in arithmetic. 
Using the Illinois General Intelligence Scale. (38) 
Full directions for giving the scale are printed in a 
Teacher’s Handbook. Each test in this scale is marked. 
The sum of the marks earned in the intelligence tests 
give a total known as the “point score,” P. S. The 
point score, in itself, is of no consequence but it is indis- 
pensable in obtaining the mental age and the intelligence 
quotient, I. Q., of the examinee. A simple formula, 
at 88. ea aie M.A., enables the teacher to obtain the 
mental age. However, to avoid much simple calculation, 
Table I in the Teacher’s Handbook! can be used. For 
a pupil to whom was given the intelligence scale, we 
have the point score; and this, through the use of 
Table I, gives the mental age and the intelligence quo- 
tient of that child.

the problem above stated is to obtain the achievement

the achievement quotient. The arithmetic score is 
obtained from the Monroe Arithmetic Scale. The

on intelligence (see Table XXXV). Through a correct 
use of Table II, Teacher’s Handbook,? we obtain the 
achievement age and achievement quotient. The data

The standard achievement quotients for the several 
grades are printed in the Teacher’s Handbook. A com- 
parison can be made with these after the median A. Q. 
for the above class is figured. 
Problem: Given two fourth grades, one in school A, the 
other in school B. Which teacher does better work in 
arithmetic? 
It is impossible to tell on the basis of the arithmetic 
medians only, which does better work, because such 
median takes no account of the mental ability of each 
class. A comparison should be made of the mentality 
and of the arithmetic achievement quotient of the two 
classes in schools A and B. 
Graphs XXI and XXII show this comparison. The 
children in grade IV of school A have a low median 
intelligence but their median achievement is at 97 + in 
arithmetic, whereas the children in school B have a 
higher intelligence quotient than those in school A. 
Since their mentality is higher their achievement should 
be likewise higher. Evidently, then, the teacher in 
school A is superior in arithmetic instruction. 
To Compare the Effectiveness of Methods.—In compar- 
ing methods in reading the reading test is administered

equal ability is chosen for the experiment. One specific 
method should be used in teaching section A; and 
another method in teaching section B. The problem to 
solve will read, “Given a teacher with two sections from 
the same grade with approximately equal ability. She 
- uses a different method with each section. Which 
method brings better results?”

Illinois Examination in Practice—In the chapter on

bined results of the reading and intelligence tests are 
reproduced on the following page.

three types of pupils from the standpoint of the effort 
they exert in reading. One type consists of the very hard 
workers. We recognize these by their I. Q. and A. Q. 
The higher the average A. Q. above 100, the harder the 
worker and vice versa. Pupils 1, 4, 6, 9, 11 are very hard 
workers. Such of these whose I. Q. is below 100 are 
exerting themselves about as much as they should. 
These are pupils 9 and 11. Pupils whose average A. Q. 
is 95-101 are doing only their share of work if their I. Q.

do better in reading. Though pupils 12, 13 have low 
I. Q.’s, their A. Q.’s are high for them and they can 
hardly be urged on to much greater effort. 
By consulting the standards in reading and the scores 
of pupils 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 in this reading test, it would be 
advisable to promote these five to grade IV in reading

Problem: Which of the sections in grade III does 
better work, A or B? 
There are two factors which determine an answer to 
this question, first the median I. Q., and second the 
median A. Q. of each section. In Tables XX XVIII and

purposes these medians and the standards for grade III 
are shown in Graphs XXIII and XXIV, given on page 
125. 
The median intelligence of Section B is higher than 
that of Section A. The former section should have a 
higher A. Q., that is, it should do better work since it 
possesses a higher mental average. Section B, however, 
has a much lower A. Q. than Section A, which means 
that it, having ability to do the better work, is really 
doing the inferior work. Manifestly then, Section B is 
not fully realizing its opportunity. The pupils in the 
two sections should be reclassified, some to the next 
higher grade and several more should be resectioned, if 
the administration desires homogeneous groups in each 
section of this grade III reading class.

  CHAPTER VI 
DIAGNOSIS IN SPELLING 
Questions 
1. Is it advisable to test pupils on spelling words before teaching 
the words to a class? Why? 
2. A word when first seen by the pupil should be correctly spelled 
to facilitate good spelling. This is the belief of some spelling students. 
If your answer to “1” above, invites many misspellings, what justifica- 
tion is there for testing first and thereafter teaching the correct spell- 
ing of the misspelled words? 
3. At the average rate of two new words a day the pupil should 
learn to spell in seven years 2520 words. Why do elementary schools 
fail to turn out good spellers when but little new work need be done 
daily? 
4. Which words, peculiar to the study of citizenship, history, arith- 
metic, reading, and other school subjects, should be taught in the 
spelling class? 
5. Which of these should be taught as a part of the subject from 
which they are chosen? 
6. Should child’s grade in citizenship, hygiene, geography, or other 
subject, be penalized for misspellings in that subject? Why? 
Minimal Spelling Lists—Studies made by Ayres, 
Courtis, Cook and O’Shea, Horn, Pryor, and others, con- 
firm a belief, now well grounded, that the aim of the 
elementary school in teaching spelling should be to 
teach the spelling of comparatively few words. They 
suggest the teaching of a minimal list of words, this to 
be supplemented (7) by a further well chosen list. 
These studies, on the whole, preclude the thought of 
teaching from 4000 to 5000 words to pupils in the first 
eight grades. Teaching such a large number of words 
was the educational order of the day, until recently. 
128
-P-A-G-E-147
SPELLING 129 
Economy of time in education sanctions teaching to a 
100 per cent perfection of spelling ability, a small num- 
ber of common words used over and over again by all 
who write (12),1 and a reasonable command over other 
words (a supplementary list) which find their way into a 
child’s written vocabulary. 
Ayres’ Spelling List—The best list of the 1000 most 
commonly used words was prepared by Ayres, which 
he arranged in the form of a spelling scale, commonly 
known as the Ayres Measuring Scale for Ability in 
Spelling (1). 
The 1000 words of the Ayres Scale are arranged in 
twenty-six columns, the words in Column A being easiest; 
those in Column B being as much more difficult than 
those in Column A as those in Column C are more diffi- 
cult than those in Column B, etc. The words in Column 
Z are most difficult. Thus the steps in spelling difficulty 
are increasingly greater in each column toward the end 
of the scale. The degree of difficulty of each column is 
different for each grade. The words in Column K (see 
scale) should be spelled with average accuracies of 58 
per cent by a second grade, 79 per cent by a third grade, 
92 per cent by a fourth grade, ete. 
Limits of Groups.—Limits are as follows: “50 means 
from 46 through 54 per cent; 58 means from 55 through 
62 per cent; 66 means from 63 through 69 per cent; 73 
means from 70 through 76 per cent”; and so on. 
“By means of these groupings a child’s spelling ability 
may be located in terms of grades. Thus, if a child were 
given a 20 word spelling test from the words of Column O 
and he spelled 15 words, or 75 per cent of them, cor- 
rectly, it would be proper to say that he showed a fourth 
*Page 56. 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  130 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
grade spelling ability. If he spelled correctly 17 words, 
or 85 per cent, he would show fifth grade ability, and 
so on.” + 
Giving a Test—It is recommended that 20 to 25 words 
be used in giving a test. These should be selected from 
one column for a single test. There is no objection, in 
retesting the same grade, to use words from another 
column. To test a particular grade, such words should 
be chosen as can be spelled by the pupils with a 65 to 
75 per cent degree of correctness. A grade is not really 
tested by a column of words which is too easy. Since the 
words were arranged in columns on the basis of column 
spelling, any test with the Ayres’ Scale should be given 
in that way only. The contextual method of giving 
the words should not be used. The words should be 
distinctly pronounced, defined or used in a sentence only 
when there is fair doubt which word of two is intended. 
Thus, in pronouncing “their,” a sentence or definition 
should make clear that the class is not being asked to 
spell “there.” If there is difficulty in understanding a 
word it should be used in a simple sentence. The pupils 
should be given sufficient time to spell each word before 
proceeding to the next. 
Scoring the Papers.—After the test is given the papers 
are collected, the incorrectly spelled words are marked, 
and the correct scores are recorded. In the upper grades, 
the pupils may assist in marking the papers, under the 
examiner’s direction. However, papers marked by pupils 
should be rechecked by the examiner. The median score 
of the class should next be figured. The median affords 
a basis of comparison with the standard on the scale. 
A uniformity of standard should be employed in mark- 
*Quoted from Ayres Scale.
-P-A-G-E-149
  SPELLING 131 
ing the words. Bearing in mind that good spelling is a 
habituated and automatic process, it is suggested that the 
word should be correctly spelled upon first effort. This 
means that (a) no erasures, (b) no crossing out of 
letters, (¢) no rewriting of the entire word, (d) no patch- 
ing, are permissible. Evidence of these should be proof 
of misspelling, the same as if a letter is omitted from, 
or a wrong letter or letters are inserted in the word. 
(e) Also too much time should not elapse between the 
words when pronounced by the examiner. 
A further illustration will make scoring of papers clear. 
Suppose we desire to test a third grade class. The words 
should be of 65-75 per cent difficulty, hence, the words 
from Column K, L, or M, may be used. Twenty or 
twenty-five words from Column L should be given the 
class to spell. After the papers are graded, the class 
median is compared with the third grade standard for 
this column. The standard is 73 per cent, which means 
70 through 76 per cent. 
Interpretation of Results——(a) Class as Whole. The 
class as a whole may be above, at or below the standard. 
If the class is well above standard, the total amount of 
time which is being devoted to spelling may be dimin- 
ished. If the class is at standard, the amount of time 
devoted to spelling should remain unchanged. If the 
class is below standard the time allowance for the class 
should not be increased, but special work employed 
to bring the class to a better spelling ability. How this 
may be done will be discussed later. 
(b) Individual Difficulties. Whatever may be the 
median of class accomplishment, there are in each class 
some pupils who are distinctly below standard. A test 
of twenty or twenty-five words is a good index of class 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
           132 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
but not of individual ability. By giving a list of fifty 
words to the backward pupils, the teacher may determine 
quite closely the spelling difficulty of each of them. 
This should be supplemented by further diagnosis upon 
the basis of which should be determined remedial 
measures. 
Advantages in Using the Scale—In giving a test to the 
class, followed by another after an interval of about 
three months, the progress of the class as a whole can 
be noted. Supplementary tests to individual pupils will, 
when followed by subsequent tests, give evidence of 
individual progress. Such measures are desirable in order 
to motivate the children’s work and to assist the teacher 
in stressing work where stress belongs. The use of the 
scale discloses weaknesses which make diagnosis possible 
so that remedial measures can be determined. 
Ayres’ Scale a Course of Study—Dr. Ayres realizes 
that as pupils become more able to spell his list of 1000 
words his scale ceases, in that proportion, to serve as a 
measure of spelling ability. There can be no harm in 
this fact for the ultimate end is that children learn how 
to spell the most commonly used words in the English 
vocabulary. Dr. Ayres says, “Probably the scale will 
have served its greatest usefulness in any locality when 
the school children have mastered these 1000 words so 
thoroughly that the scale has become quite useless as a 
measuring instrument.” 
Detroit Course of Study.—Courtis devised “A Tentative 
Course of Study in Spelling” for the Detroit Public 
Schools. (7). This course consists of drill words, sup- 
plementary words, and selected words. The drill words, 
1000 in number, include only those of the Ayres’ scale 
and are arranged by grades. Two hundred fifty are
-P-A-G-E-151
    SPELLING 133 
listed for grade II, A and B; 180 for grade III, A and 
B; 180 for grade IV, A and B, 130 for grade V, A and 
B; and 120 for each of the succeeding grades. 
A Supplementary list of words are “those frequently 
missed by children as proved by tabulation of the mis- 
spellings found in children’s compositions. In the main 
they are taken from the list compiled by the Bureau of 
Research and Efficiency of Kansas City, Missouri, and 
are based upon the mistakes found in 49,797 composi- 
tions.” From this list only such words are recommended 
for selection as in the judgment of the teacher are most 
necessary. The selected words are those chosen by the 
teacher from various subjects of study as geography, 
hygiene, citizenship, etc. 
It is recommended that the Courtis distribution, by 
grades, of the Ayres 1000 words in the Detroit Course in 
Spelling, be made the first basis of corrective work in 
improving spelling.

Test Before Teaching.—Ritter and Horn (22) revealed 
that there is 75 per cent waste of the time of a class in 
spelling by requiring each child to study the spelling 
of every word in a spelling list. The inevitable conclu- 
sion from the standpoint of method is to test pupils on 
a list of words before teaching them to a class. In prac- 
tice this means that grade II B (or grade II A in first 
Semester) should be given to spell all the words of the 
Ayres’ scale listed by Courtis for each one-half year. 
Pryor and Pittman recommend this practice in teaching 
spelling. (20)! This test should be given before the 
pupils receive any instruction on such list. Since the list 
includes 140 words, the test may consist of about 25 
words at a time. The results obtained from a series 
of such tests should constitute the basis of spelling work. 
In practice it would seem best to dispose of each group 
of 25 words before proceeding with the next group. The 
results with the Ayres list of words as graded by Courtis 
should be cumulative, and not only within the grade 
*Pages 39 to 42.
-P-A-G-E-153
  SPELLING 135 
but also from year to year. Barring exceptional children 
then, a second grade should spell with 100 per cent ability 
all the Ayres words of the first grade and of the second 
grade, as far as the class has advanced. A third grade 
class should spell perfectly the first and second grade 
words of the Ayres graded list and eventually all of the 
third grade list, and so on. 
Dean Suhrie believes that not until in the fourth grade 
should children be tested before the common words are 
taught. This seems an altogether reasonable point of 
view and should be very seriously entertained. At any 
rate before the beginning of the second grade a child’s 
spelling content is so limited that it may be presumed 
that most words, if first tested, will be misspelled. Prac- 
tice will determine whether this is also true of spelling 
ability of the Ayres list in grades II and III. 
What Shall We Do with the Results?—Given a third 
grade which is to be subjected to a test on the first 
twenty-five words of the Ayres graded list. How shall 
we proceed? The pupils should be informed that they 
are about to write spelling words which have not been 
studied in class. They should be encouraged to do their 
best, though no pupil will likely spell correctly all of the 
words. After the papers are marked a tabulation of the

  136 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
test list should be made to show which are the easy and 
which the difficult words for the class and for the indi- 
vidual pupil. A part of such tabulation is given for 
illustrative purposes. (See page 135.) 
This table gives the teacher three types of words: 
the first, which is correctly spelled by all the pupils; 
the second, which is incorrectly spelled by all the pupils; 
and, a third, which is spelled correctly by some and mis- 
spelled by others. 
Words Correctly Spelled by All.—The words “about,” 
“ago,” “camp,” are correctly spelled by all the pupils 
taking the test. Except for review purposes such words 
need no further teaching. Without testing first, the 
teacher would waste valuable time in trying to teach 
such words, though the pupils already know how to spell 
them. Whether there is danger in requiring a child to 
write a word before learning how to spell it is discussed 
elsewhere. 
Words Incorrectly Spelled by All—The words “catch” 
and “child” are incorrectly spelled by each member of the 
class and should, therefore, be taught to all the pupils. 
Needless to say that out of the 130 words listed for grade 
III, many words would be correctly spelled by all and 
more words would be misspelled by all than are indicated 
in the above illustrative table. 
Words Correctly Spelled by Some.—Some words will be 
incorrectly spelled by certain pupils and correctly by 
others. It is probable that any words which are mis- 
spelled by more than 60 per cent of the class should be 
taught to the class as a whole. What should be done 
with the remaining words spelled correctly by some 
pupils? It is very certain that such words could be 
taught profitably to the group of students that misspelled 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
   SPELLING 137 
them. For this purpose the class might be grouped after 
the plan of groups suggested for corrective work, fol- 
lowing the Woody Arithmetic Scales. There still will 
remain a few students, who, because their spelling is very 
imperfect, will need drill on and teaching of difficult 
words which have not been taught them through the 
above plans. For such students their remaining difficult 
words should be written on their individual spelling lists. 
The individual lists of drill words may be taught the 
poorer pupils by the bright ones under the immediate 
direction of the teacher, in so far as she cannot do the 
teaching herself. 
Causes of Poor Spelling —Poor spelling may arise from 
several causes. To know these and to discover them in 
pupils places the teacher in a position to do effective 
remedial work. Hollingworth (10) made a psychological 
examination of poor spellers. 
It reveals that (a) “Poor spelling may be due to 
sensory defects, either of the ear or the eye.” There- 
fore, the teacher should make certain whether her poor 
spellers have poor vision or hearing. A discovery of 
sensory defects should be followed with proper remedies. 
(b) “The quality, of general intelligence must be de- 
termined.” The assumption here made is that pupils 
with low mentality cannot successfully compete in spell- 
ing with pupils of high mentality. Studies made by 
Horn and Prosser and reported in the Highteenth Year- 
book,t Part II, tend to disprove this. Horn admits 
positive correlations (63, 100) between general ability 
and spelling ability and adds, “but a year’s teaching of 
a sixth-grade class in which pupils of superior, average, 
and inferior intelligence (as measured by the Stanford 
*Page 64. 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  188 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
revision) had the same learning practice, showed that 
the children of inferior intelligence (not feeble-minded) 
profited as much from this training as children of more 
than average intelligence.” Horn admits the experiment 
is not conclusive and questions whether poor showing, 
according to various spelling surveys, of children of in- 
ferior intelligence, is not due in part to inferior methods 
of learning. 
(c) Faulty pronunciation is partially responsible for 
poor spelling. “Which,” “farther,” “went” are spelled 
w-i-t-c-h, f-u-r-t-h-e-r, w-h-e-n-t because the child spells 
what he pronounces. The cause of such mispronuncia- 
tion is varied. It may be due to poor teaching, to home 
and community standards, to phonetic spelling, as 
o-f-e-n for “often,” to associates, to poor hearing, to 
wrong organic control in mouth and throat. Kallom (15) 
discusses mispronunciation as a cause of misspelling, at 
some length. 
(d) Incorrect visual perception is another cause of 
poor spelling. Among poor spellers errors follow certain 
laws due to weaknesses in visual perception. Thus some 
children show weakness in spelling correctly the last 
halves of words, spelling correctly the first halves; or 
weaknesses in noting the position of the vowels, locating 
correctly, the consonants. 
(e) Failure to retain is responsible for misspelling. 
Some children learn to spell correctly a number of words 
but, in a few days, are unable to spell these words cor- 
rectly again. Their memory span is unusually short for 
hard or long words. Their difficulty may be overcome 
through an emphasis upon small units as syllabication, 
prefixes, suffixes and other structures of words. Pupils 
+ Pages 398-401.
-P-A-G-E-157
  SPELLING 139 
with short memory spans should receive frequent drills 
on words. 
’ (f) One cause of misspelling now generally obviated is 
a knowledge of the meaning of words. If spelling words 
are intelligently chosen by the teacher, there should be 
no great trouble in requiring of pupils the meaning of 
words. The teacher should remember that a child knows 
the meaning of a word if it is used intelligently in a 
sentence. A dictionary definition need not necessarily 
be required. 
Poor penmanship, lapses in writing words, change from 
a foreign to the American language also cause misspell- 
ings. To learn correct spelling children must form as 
many specific bonds as there are words. This is a matter 
of work involving tedious drudgery. 
Exemption from Spelling —If at the beginning of grade 
VII a pupil can spell correctly all the words of Ayres’ 
Scale and additional supplementary words suggested in 
the Courtis Tentative Course, or all the 1505 words of 
the Buckingham Extension of the Ayres’ Scale or all 
the Ayres 1000 words and of Pryor’s Minimal Spelling 
List and the “100 Spelling Demons,” it seems unneces- 
sary for such child to remain in any spelling class, and 
should on this basis be automatically excused from 
school work in spelling thereafter. However, such child 
should be subjected to periodic tests on the words in the 
Buckingham Extension of the Ayres’ Scale and the “100 
Spelling Demons” to rejustify his right to this exemption 
from a spelling class. 
Jones’ “100 Spelling Demons.”—Dr. Jones (13) made an 
investigation into the spelling difficulties of children in 
the elementary schools and listed the 100 commonly 
used words which prove most difficult in these schools,

Pryor’s Suggested Minimal Spelling List.—This list was 
prepared as a summary of twelve spelling lists “that have 
been developed by investigators who have studied” the 
question of developing spelling lists. The Pryor Minimal 
List is too long to be here included, but it may be con- 
sulted in either of two available works. (19, 20) 2 
Buckingham’s Extension of Ayres’s Spelling Scale— 
This scale is, as its name implies, an extension of the 
Ayres’ Measuring Scale for Ability in Spelling. To the 
Ayres list of 1000 most commonly used words selected 
from correspondence, literary selections, Sunday news- 
* Pages 77-84 or 85-95.
-P-A-G-E-159
  SPELLING 141 
papers, and short business letters, Buckingham adds 505 
words according to agreements among spelling books. 
His scale of 1505 words is used in the same way as the 
Ayres’ Scale is used. However, it is preferable to the 
Ayres’ Scale for measuring the spelling ability of upper 
grade pupils because more words are added to the harder 
end of the scale. 
Courtis Timed Sentence Tests—S. A. Courtis (7) sug- 
gests timed sentence tests for use in initial and final test- 
ing of spelling abilities, in grades III to VIII inclusive, a 
pair of tests for each half year. A timed sentence test 
is the best test of spelling ability inasmuch as spelling 
accomplishments on written work most nearly approxi- 
mate actual life spelling conditions. Also, column spell- 
ing ability is a less accurate test than the dictation test 
because it is easier, hence, a less correct measure. Here 
are reproduced the tests for grade III. 
For the remaining tests see the excellent course of 
study in spelling suggested by Courtis (7).2

Directions for Giving Tests—‘Ask the children to lay 
their pens down and listen. Next, read the test through 
slowly. Then have them take their pens and get ready 
to write. When the seconds hand of your watch reaches 
60, dictate the first sentence. When the seconds hand 
reaches the position shown by the figures in the parenthe- 
sis before the second sentence, dictate the second sen- 
tence, and so on. You will need to practice giving the 
test once or twice before giving it to the class.” 
Scoring the Test—Count as misspelled any of the test . 
words that are illegible, omitted, changed, or incorrectly 
spelled. Do not count off for poor writing or failure to 
dot i’s or cross t’s. 
Games in Teaching Spelling—The teaching of spelling 
to pupils, especially to those who find the subject diffi- 
cult, can be motivated through the use of games. Many 
games are used, such as, baseball, “I am thinking of a 
word,” and so on. Courtis (7) suggests the following: 
. Syllable Game. 
Jumbled Letter Game. 
. Initial Game. 
. Rhyming Game. Powe

Principles of Method in Teaching Spelling —Certain 
principles of method in the teaching of spelling have been 
summarized in an excellent contribution made by Horn 
(12). Some of these are: 
1. Do not depend solely upon the incidental teaching of spelling. 
2. Rules cannot replace direct instruction in spelling, even in the 
ease of words covered by them. Horn says, “In the light of present 
evidence one seems to be justified in recommending that the teaching 
of rules be abandoned until more conclusive evidence is presented to 
show that the time spent in teaching them is as productive of efficiency 
as the same amount of time spent in teaching the words directly.” 
Dr. Cook (5) made an investigation into the teaching of spelling 
by rule. He concludes his study with the following words, “The 
writer does not believe that a single rule which he tested demonstrated 
its efficiency, except (that words in ze substitute for them y before ing). 
It is at least evident that rules for spelling do not teach themselves; 
that if teachers do not insist upon their being learned they will be 
neglected; that they cannot be taught once and then dismissed from 
attention like an event in history; that thoroughness of digestion 
demands that they be given in widely separated doses, and that they 
must be introduced, if at all, in the elementary school during the habit 
forming period, while the pupil still spells reflectively rather than 
automatically. The presumption is even then against a favorable out- 
come, except with a superior teacher.” * 
Thus it appears that learning to spell by rule is about as effective 
in producing good spellers as learning to speak by rule is fruitful in 
producing linguistic artists. 
8. Pupil should learn to spell those words which he needs to spell 
and no others. 
4. Words commonly used in correspondence should be taught early 
before elimination of pupils becomes serious. 
5. Those words needed in other subjects should be taught in appro- 
priate grades. The spelling of words like divisor, percentage; or 
Gettysburg, proclamation, reconstruction, etc., might best be taught 
on certain days in connection with subjects from which they are chosen, 
* Page 325,
-P-A-G-E-162
  144 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
6. On the whole but few words should be taught in each spelling 
lesson. 
7. The daily spelling period should be short, not longer than fifteen 
minutes. 
8. The recitation period should be a learning period. The spelling 
period should be a directed study period only, a part of which is 
devoted to testing for results. 
9. Test all words before teaching. By observing this principle 
approximately 75 per cent of the time of the class will be saved. 
10. Better provision should be made for individual instruction in 
spelling. 
11. Regarding point 9, bear in mind that “Contrary to what is often 
said, initial errors made on preliminary tests do not persist.” 
The point has often been raised that the first written impression of 
a word should be in its correct form. In answer to this it is proven 
that, “The resulting feeling of dissatisfaction at having missed the 
word, plus the concentrated attack on remedying the exact difficulty, 
more than outweighs any disadvantages arising from the initial mis- 
spelling.” (Green, Horn and McBrown, Ritter and Horn.) 
It is further urged that by testing before teaching spelling words, 
wrong habits are formed. Such an argument is humorous to say the 
least. A habit is formed only after numerous repetitions of the same 
act. If a pupil writes a word in a preliminary test, misspells it, then 
finds it in his spelling assignment and has to learn it before the recita- 
tion convenes, and subsequently is drilled and reviewed on that word, 
surely one misspelling cannot constitute a habit; neither can the one 
conscious error withstand subsequent teaching of the word. 
12. Each child should give special attention to those words which 
are repeatedly missed by him. 
Each pupil has his “spelling demons” which should constitute a part 
of his individual spelling test. 
13. Methods which are suitable for the good speller are apparently 
also suitable for the poor speller. 
14. Emphasis in presenting the word should be upon visual imagery. 
15. Correct pronunciation of a word is a very important factor in 
learning to spell it. 
16. Stress on syllabication of words is an important element in 
learning to spell. However, syllabication can be overdone. In so far 
as a knowledge of syllabication is needed to divide correctly words at 
the ends of sentences, it should be taught; except for this, according 
to Hollingworth (10),* syllabication should be stressed mainly with 
such pupils whose failure to retain is due to a short memory span, 
*Page 129.
-P-A-G-E-163
  
   SPELLING 145 
and not all pupils are thus afflicted, so wholesale syllabication should 
not be required grade for grade, or in any one grade. 
17. For class instruction “it does not seem to be worth while to call 
attention to any portion of the word by writing that portion of the 
word in colored crayon, or by any other device.” This is so because 
for most words there is no one predominating error. A corollary to 
this principle is that for individual instruction, it -is feasible to use 
marking devices which emphasize the difficulty in the word. Kal- 
lom (15)? reproduces 101 misspellings of the word “superintendent” 
explaining that the causes of misspelling are not located entirely in 
any special part of the word. He observes that the greatest difficulty 
is inherent in the middle of the word. Dean Suhrie insists that an 
appreciable number of certain words contain specific difficulties to 
most pupils who misspell such words. He considers this fact of enough 
importance to stress it in his speller and teacher’s manual accom- 
panying the same. 
18. Writing the word aids in learning it. 
19. There should be provision for review drill periods. 
20. It is important that each pupil be taught how to spell. 
How to Learn to Spell a Word.—(a) The following direc- 
tions have been used by pupils in the University Ele- 
mentary School at the State University of Iowa. 
“1, The first step in learning to spell a word is to pronounce it 
correctly. If you do not know how to pronounce a word, look up the 
pronunciation in the dictionary. When you are certain that you know 
how the word is pronounced, pronounce it, enunciating each syllable 
distinctly and looking closely at each syllable as you say it. 
2. Close your eyes and try to recall how the word looks, syllable 
by syllable, as you pronounce it in a whisper. In pronouncing the 
word be sure to enunciate the syllables carefully. 
3. Open your eyes to make sure that you were able to recall the 
correct spelling. 
4. Look at the word again, enunciating the syllables distinctly. 
5. Recall again, with closed eyes, how the word looked. 
6. Check again with the correct form. This recall (as in 2 and 5) 
should be repeated at least three times, and oftener if you have diffi- 
culty in recalling the correct form of the word. 
7. When you feel sure that you have learned the word, write it 
without looking at the book, and then check with the correct form. 
*Page 405.
-P-A-G-E-164
  
  146 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
8. Repeat this two or more times without looking either at the 
book or at your previous attempts. 
9. If you miss the word on either of these trials, you should copy 
it in your spelling notebook, since it probably is especially difficult 
for you.” 
Horn expresses the following factors as rules in teach- 
ing spelling: 
1. Test all words before teaching. 
2. Let each child work only on the words difficult for him and 
provide him with a definite method of learning them. 
3. Provide for vigorous reviews. 
4. Show the pupil his progress daily, weekly, monthly and yearly. 
5. Keep up the interest.

DIAGNOSIS IN WRITING 
Questions 
1. Which is the most legible handwriting, vertical, semi-vertical or 
slant? 
2. Can you mention scientific experiments in proof of your answer 
to the above? 
3. Compare three samples of perfect penmanship in which is used 
the same slant. Do these samples show the writer’s individuality? - 
4. In what phases of the business world is uniformity of penmanship 
desirable? In which phases of it is individuality preferable? 
5. Longhand penmanship is a slow way of recording ideas. Would 
shorthand penmanship economize time? Illustrate your answer. 
6. Much and rapid note taking in the high school and the college 
tend to break penmanship habits long forming in the grades. Is there 
any practical way of overcoming this neutralization of the penmanship 
in the grades? 
Place of Penmanship.—It is probable that undue em- 
phasis is being placed upon the teaching of penmanship 
in the public schools. The public has been clamoring 
for a high degree of penmanship ability; and, at the 
same time, private business is expending money on type- 
writers for use in abstract offices, register of deeds 
offices, banks, stores, real estate and insurance offices, 
and other places of business. Private individuals find 
the typewriter a convenience and manufacturing firms 
are placing on the market small, portable machines for 
the use of the traveling public. 
On the other hand, many teachers are so enthused 
with the teaching of penmanship that they take more 
pride in displaying samples of handwriting than in dis- 
149
-P-A-G-E-168
  
  150 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
playing the health records of their grade and results in 
health instruction for their pupils. Constantly, with but 
few exceptions, specific attention to the regular teaching 
of citizenship in every grade of the elementary school 
is neglected and, in the meantime, penmanship is daily 
given a place on most school programs. 
Life situations place exactions upon people in such a 
way that the customary longhand penmanship should 
be supplemented by some instrument of greater facility 
in recording ideas than one which, for speed of execution 
and representations of ideas, is but an imitation of the 
“ox-team” method of accomplishing results. What 
lawyer, newspaper reporter, secretary of a public or any 
meeting, traveling man, high school or university student 
or professor, or other busy person in the stress of life, 
but has felt repeatedly his shortcoming by not know- 
ing shorthand? In our scheme to teach recording and 
transcribing ideas, the schools should find a place for 
teaching shorthand penmanship above grade VI in the 
elementary school. In grade VII and for the year that 
follows, as in the preceding grades, longhand penmanship 
should be taught, nevertheless. 
Possibility of Measuring Penmanship.—Some studies in 
the measurement of penmanship have gone into the 
matter at considerable detail, taking into account shape, 
slant, and detailed structure of letters (4). Analytic 
handwriting scales are less useful in the hands of 
amateurs than less pretentious instruments. Since the 
business and social demands of life stress speed and 
legibility of writing, provision for testing same should 
be made in a measuring scale. One of the earlier at- 
tempts at measuring handwriting was made in 1912 (1). 
It took into account three possible slants of penman-
-P-A-G-E-169
WRITING 151 
ship—vertical, semi-vertical, and slant—and attempted 
to evaluate the quality of each. This scale would prove 
very useful were it standardized for speed as well. No 
experiments, known to the writer, have proven that a 
slant system of penmanship is more legible and speedy 
of execution than the semi-slant or the vertical systems. 
In the elementary grades semi-vertical penmanship is 
very popular with teachers. 
The Thorndike Scale—Dr. E. L. Thorndike gave to the 
educational world the first handwriting scale. It is 
based upon beauty, legibility, and general merit of pen- 
manship. Values, to specimens of penmanship in this 
scale, were assigned by competent judges. Like the 
Ayres’, it is a general scale, and is not so generally known 
by classroom teachers. 
Ayres’ Measuring Scale for Handwriting (2).—This is a 
uni-slant scale consisting of eight samples of hand- 
writing. This scale is known as the “Gettysburg 
Edition” to distinguish it from the “Three Slant Edition” 
and the adult handwriting scale. The samples of pen- 
manship for the “Gettysburg Edition” were obtained by 
having pupils write the first part of the Gettysburg 
Address. The samples so obtained were arranged by 
competent judges in order of their quality. After sev- 
eral revisions the scale was presented in its final form. 
It is self-explanatory and very simple. Directions for 
securing samples, and for scoring are printed thereon. 
(See Scale.) 
Scoring Samples——The samples of penmanship are 
scored for speed and quality. More advanced pupils 
can assist in scoring for speed. For this purpose the 
key may be transcribed on the blackboard. It is here 
reproduced:

152 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
“Four 4 score 9 and 12 seven 17 years 22 ago 25 our 
28 fathers 35 brought 42 forth 47 upon 51 this 55 con- 
tinent 64 a 65 new 68 nation 74 conceived 83 in

sition 120 that 124 all 127 men 130 are 133 created 140

a 163 great 168 civil 173 war 176 testing 183 whether 
190 that 194 nation 200 or 202 any 205 nation 211 so

a 260 great 265 battlefield 276 of 278 that 282 war 285.” 
Ayres gives the following directions for scoring 
quality: 
“To score samples slide each specimen along the scale 
until a writing of the same quality is found. The num- 
ber at the top of the scale above this shows the value of 
the writing being measured. Disregard differences in 
style, but try to find on the scale the quality correspond- 
ing with that of the sample being scored. With practice 
the scorer will develop the ability to recognize qualities 
more rapidly and with increasing accuracy. If the scor- 
ing is done twice, the results will be considerably more 
accurate than if done only once. The procedure may be 
as follows: Score samples and distribute them in piles 
with all the 20’s in one pile, all the 30’s in another, and 
so on. Mark these values on the backs of the papers, 
then shuffle the samples and score them a second time. 
Finally make careful decisions to overcome any disagree- 
ments in the two scorings.” 
Illustrating Use of Scale—To explain further use of 
this scale let us assume that a fourth grade class was 
measured for ability in penmanship with results as tabu- 
lated (Table XL).

below:

Rate ccssceixens es 32 44 56 64 70 76 80 
The quality is not recorded for any grade in terms 
of per cents. The number for rate represents the number 
of letters a child should write per minute. The child’s 
handwriting is estimated in terms of both rate and 
quality. The papers have been scored and the results 
noted in Table XL. The standards are reproduced in 
Table XLI. Since a graphic representation assists diag- 
nosis, Table XL is graphed for that purpose. 
Constructing the Graph.—Since the lowest mark (Table 
XL) for rate is 42 and the highest is 65 we represent on 
the vertical line at the left, numbers a trifle below and 
above these -two scores, indicating the rate by fives. 
Since the lowest quality mark (Table XL) is 25 and the 
highest 60, the numbers along the bottom, horizontal 
line of the graph are chosen to include these low and 
high scores for quality. Next the results of the test are 
recorded. Pupil 1, scoring a rate of 44 and a quality 
of 50, is located at the intersection of those lines. His 
position is indicated by a dot, the number 1 being placed .

above it. Pupil 2, scoring a rate of 60 and a quality of 
25, is located at the intersection of those lines. His 
position is indicated by a dot, the number 2 being 
placed above it. In like manner the other ten pupils 
are located on the graph. 
The object of Graph XX’V is to show, with the use of 
medians, (a) how the class compares with the standards 
in rate and quality, (b) how individual pupils compare

with the standards, (c) and how these facts help in diag- 
nosing the class condition. 
The medians for this grade are, for rate 55, for quality 
46.6. For convenience of distinction from the standards, 
they are represented with broken lines on the graph. 
The standards (see Table XLI) are represented with con- 
tinuous lines. The standards in the graph intersect at 
right angles, as do the medians. 
Interpreting Graph XXV.—The standard and median 
for rate are parallel to each other and almost coincide, 
which means that the class, as a whole, is virtually at 
standard. By following the vertical lines through the 
middle of the graph we again note that the standard
-P-A-G-E-173
  WRITING 155 
and the median for quality almost coincide, meaning that 
the class, as a whole, is at standard in quality of hand- 
writing. All pupils to the right of the middle vertical 
line are above standard in quality of handwriting; all 
to the left of this line are below standard in quality of 
handwriting. The farther that pupils are away from this 
line to the right the more superior is their quality; the 
farther they are to the left the more inferior is their 
quality of penmanship. All pupils above the continu- 
ous horizontal line are above standard in rate; those 
below are below standard in rate. 
(a) Class Divisions. The intersecting medians divide 
the class into four divisions. Division I includes pupils 
above standard in both rate and quality of handwriting; 
Division II, pupils above standard in quality and below 
standard in rate; Division III, below standard in both 
rate and quality; Division IV, above standard in rate 
and below in quality. 
(b) Special Groups. Within the four divisions are 
possible special groups of children. One such group 
consists of pupils far in advance of their grade; another, 
of pupils far below their grade in quality and rate of 
handwriting. 
Remedial Measures—After the class is tested and the 
results are graphed, and the graph is interpreted, how 
can the teacher use such interpretations to improve her 
teaching? 
(a) Class.—The class as a whole is at standard in rate 
of handwriting, but there remains much for the teacher 
to do in improving rate, for pupils 4, 6, 11, 7, 10, and 1 
are below standard in rate. As a whole, the class is at 
standard in quality of handwriting but pupils 8, 4, 11, 
10, and 2 are below standard. Briefly, though the class
-P-A-G-E-174
  156 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
medians almost coincide with the standards, with the 
above fourth grade this is of little consequence inas- 
much as the range of the class extends in rate and 
quality below and above the abilities of fourth graders. 
Remedial measures applied to the class as a whole are 
less effective than those applied to class groups. 
(b) Groups.—For freedom of administration and in- 
struction it is best to minimize the number of class 
groups. Division I constitutes a group, Group I, which 
needs no special help in improving its penmanship. 
Within this group are two pupils, 9, 12, whose welfare 
will be discussed under the caption of “special group,” 
later. Group II, consisting of Divisions II and III, lacks 
in rate of writing. On the basis of their common weak- 
ness, certain days of the week, say, Monday and Tues- 
day, should be devoted to increasing their rate of writing. 
Methods appropriate for this purpose should be used. A 
few such methods will be discussed later in this chap- 
ter. Group III, Divisions III and IV, show deficiency 
in quality of handwriting. On the basis of this common 
weakness, certain days of the week, say Wednesday and 
Thursday, should be devoted to improving quality of 
handwriting of this group. Appropriate methods for 
developing quality of handwriting should now be used. 
Mention of a few such methods will be made later. 
(c) Special Groups——Graph XXV shows pupils who 
represent two types of needs. One such type is in Division 
I and consists of pupils far ahead of their grade in pen- 
manship ability. By consulting Roman numerals at top 
and right of the graph, pupil 9 is above grade V in rate 
and above grade VII in quality of writing. (The Roman 
numerals are located at points representing ends of lines 
which if extended would designate respective grade
-P-A-G-E-175
  
WRITING 157 
standards in rate and quality of handwriting.) This 
pupil might be promoted to grade V in penmanship for 
he exceeds the fifth grade standard in both phases of 
penmanship. With proper attention to an increase in 
his rate pupil 12 may be disposed of in the same way: 
A second type of pupil is found in Division III. He 
belongs to the extreme opposite of type one; his rate 
and quality of handwriting are below or a little above 
the third grade standard. Pupils 10 and 11 belong to 
this backward type. They may be demoted; however, 
such practice is unpopular with teachers and it arouses 
the parents and even the community. Such pupils 
should be accorded very special attention. The causes 
of their weaknesses are varied and should be discovered, 
if possible. Muscular coérdination may be poor owing 
to youth. Carelessness may be the underlying cause. 
If the child uses a mixed slant, uniformity of slant 
should be stressed; if some letters are too large for the 
others, uniformity in size should be worked for; if 
letters in words are unevenly spaced, the teaching should 
eradicate such fault. Good models from the teacher, 
with intelligent practice by the child to correct a defect 
known to him, will help. At best, in most cases, such 
children will not become excellent penmen. 
Children in special classes are entitled to their share 
of attention in acquiring this tool subject. Such atten- 
tion should be directed toward the remedial teaching 
exacted by superior or inferior abilities. However, no 
teacher is bound to yield an undue portion of her time 
to such pupils, out of justice to the entire class. 
Diagnostic Handwriting Scales—To assist the teacher 
in diagnosing the defects in very poor writing either of 
two scales will be found useful.
-P-A-G-E-176
158 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
(a) Freeman’s Scale (4). This is a fusion of five 
scales into one which take into account five characteris- 
tics of penmanship, namely, slant, alignment, quality 
of line, letter formation, and spacing. 
(b) Gray’s Score Card (6). This analytical card is 
more complicated than the above. It assigns a perfect 
score to nine characteristics of handwriting. Heaviness, 
slant, size, alignment, spacing of lines, spacing of words, 
spacing of letters, neatness, and formation of letters 
constitute these characteristics. The perfect scores for 
the characteristics vary from 3 to 26. On the Gray score 
card are blanks for the child’s possible score. 
Manipulation of Class—After a diagnosis is made and 
remedial measures are chosen, how can the class be 
manipulated to the greatest advantage? For conven- 
ience the class should be reseated by groups, assigning 
to the special group, and Groups I, II, and III certain 
seats. This arrangement will assist the teacher in locating 
readily each needy group. On the days that she stresses 
rate, Group II will receive the major part of the time, 
and methods emphasizing progress in rate will be em- 
ployed; when quality of writing is the paramount aim, 
Group III will receive attention, and methods empha- 
sizing legibility will be useful. On all four days the 
special group will get time for its particular needs. 
The fifth day of the week may be devoted to general 
drill for the entire class or for the development of new 
work or for both. 
Correctives. 
(a) For Rate. Asa necessary preliminary for improv- 
ing rate, proper attention must be devoted to such 
matters as position of the body, the hand, the manner 
in which the paper is kept on the desk, and the manner
-P-A-G-E-177
  WRITING 159 
in which the pen is held. A corrective for slow rate 
is suggested by Monroe. It consists of writing the sen- 
tence, “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,” 
in a prescribed time limit as given herewith: 
“Highth grade pupils should write this 1 times in 4 minutes.

Sixth « « “ eee 
Fifth « “« “« Ee gt gay cee

Third “« « “ CRS Bia. a. Oe eM 
Second“ «“ “ i ee 
The idea is to drill the needy pupils on this sentence, 
containing all the letters of the alphabet, until the pupils 
can write it with the speed set above in the table. 
Using the Ayres’ standards the teacher can devise 
reasonably accurate assignments for fostering speed. 
For grade IV the rate standard is 56 letters per minute. 
The pupils should be expected to write the letter “a,” in 
groups of five, every five seconds, the teacher counting 
“1, 2, 3, 4, 5” for each group of letters written below. 
aaaaa aaaaa aaaaa aaaaa 
The next drill may be on the letter “c,” the pupils’ speci- 
mens consisting of fifty-six eee in 60 seconds as 
follows: 
ccccee ccece cccce eccee 
Another drill may be had in writing “n.” After sufficient 
practice the letters may be combined into words, as 
“can.” The pupils’ specimen paper would contain lines 
as below: 
can can can can can can 
With “can” for a practice copy the children should write 
the word eighteen times in 60 seconds, or fifty-four 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  160 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
letters, being two letters short of the standard, 56. The 
child begins to write “can” when the teacher says “1”; 
begins the word a second time when the teacher says 
“2”: a third time when she says “3”; and so on. The 
teacher should time herself in order to say a number at 
the beginning of each three second interval. 
The same principle may be applied to the writing of 
words in sentences. Such sentences can be devised by 
the teacher. To illustrate, the sentence below will serve. 
7 12 16 21 25 32 
I pledge hands, head, heart tomy country; one 
42 53 60 
country, one language, one flag. 
The teacher should instruct the children to write the 
sentence as fast as she dictates it. She will begin when 
the seconds hand is at 60, say “hands” when it is at 7, 
say “head” when it arrives at 12, say “heart” when it 
arrives at 16, and so on to the end. This exercise re- 
quires the writing of one letter per second, which is a 
trifle faster than the standard. 
(b) For Quality. To improve this phase of writing it 
may be necessary for a time, to pay little heed to rate. 
Position of body, hands and so on, are first preliminaries 
to stress. An analysis of defects in quality is desirable, 
on the basis of which analysis, correctives should be 
made. According to the nature of his defect the child 
should be made conscious of the error he is being drilled 
to eradicate. If slant lacks uniformity, drill on the 
up-and-down stroke should be given; if size of letters 
lacks uniformity, drill on letters, as m, n, o, or kh, should 
help. Poor spacing can be corrected through drill on

progressive motion required in writing short words, as 
“can,” and later longer words, as “should.” 
Motivation—The penmanship lessons should be moti- 
vated. A few motivating devices follow.

The discussions arising from the choice of such stand- 
ard should be distinctly profitable. Standards for dis- 
cussions should be sought for in the characteristics found 
in the diagnostic scales, presented on previous pages of 
this work. 
(d) Charts and graphs denoting class and individual 
progress are effective for purposes of motivation. A 
graph like that on page 154 is useful. Graph XXVI may 
be used to denote class or individual progress. Though 
this graph is devised to show a record of rate it can be 
adapted to show a record of quality. 
Another simple graph for motivation is shown on page 
162. The teacher may devise other kinds of graphs for 
motivation of penmanship. 
(e) Automatic exemption from the penmanship class 
should be encouraged beyond the sixth grade, after the 
same method suggested for automatic exemption in 
spelling. 
Principles of Method.—(5b) In teaching penmanship 
due regard must be had for proper position of body, arms, 
hand and paper, and slope of writing. A proper writing 
movement should be observed. Experience shows that 
daily practice periods of ten to fifteen minutes accom- 
plish the best results. Counting is a useful device for 
securing movement and speed. The teacher should strive 
for a “simple style of writing, of medium slant (60-70) 
and no flourishes are to be preferred.” Writing drills 
should be motivated with objective devices.

CHAPTER VIII 
DIAGNOSIS IN COMPOSITION 
Questions 
1. Is it possible to detect accurately the story value of a composi- 
tion? If so, how? 
2. What methods might be used to improve the story value of 
compositions? 
8. Would it be practicable to tabulate the typical errors made by 
pupils in capitalization, punctuation, and so on, and, on the basis of 
such tabulation, teach correctives for such specific class errors? If so, 
how would you proceed? 
4, A meagre vocabulary is often the cause of poor composition work. 
How would you go about building up children’s vocabularies? 
Value of English Composition—The conventional 
usages of society require an extensive use of written 
language. For the rank and file of humanity the letter 
is a form of composition which will ever remain popular 
and necessary. For this reason, at least, and there are 
other reasons, all people should learn to present their 
thoughts in well-constructed written form. 
Written Composition Hard to Rate.——It is difficult to 
rate written compositions because so many separate 
elements enter into their structure. Then, too, compo- 
sitions are written in several types of discourse, namely, 
narration, description, argumentation and exposition. 
There is more possibility of error in adjudging a compo- 
sition than a less complex product, such as a sample of 
penmanship. Despite these difficulties some effective 
165

  166 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
scales for measuring quality of compositions have been 
devised. 
Nassau County Supplement to the Hillegas Scale—(3) 
The Hillegas Scale for the Measurement of Quality in 
English Composition by Young People was the pioneer 
effort in composition scale construction. This scale was 
extended by Thorndike to include measuring specimens 
from grades IV to XII. This extension, a thoroughly 
useful one for measuring merit only, is known as Thorn- 
dike’s Extension of the Hillegas Scale for the Measure- 
ment of Quality in English Composition by Young 
People. Trabue devised the Nassau County Supplement 
to the Hillegas Scale. It consists of ten samples of 
composition arranged in the order of their quality. The 
first seven of those compositions, values 0 to 6.0, were 
written by children in the elementary grades. The last 
three compositions, values 7.2, 8.0 and 9.0, were selected 
from compositions which were published by Dr. Thorn- 
dike in his Extension of the Hillegas Scale. In measur- 
ing compositions with this scale the teacher is directed 
to, “Compare the quality of (their) compositions with 
the quality of the samples on the scale. Assign to your 
composition the numerical value of that evaluated 
sample which most nearly equals it in merit.” 
Willing Scale for Measuring Written Composition —(12) 
This scale of eight compositions is graded in steps of 
equal difficulty upon a theme on which the class is tested. 
The scale also contains full directions for use and stand- 
ard scores. The composition at the lowest end of the 
scale represents the poorest effort and the one at the 
right end of the scale the best effort. The other compo- 
sitions represent quality of effort by the position in 
which they are placed with reference to the best or the
-P-A-G-E-185
COMPOSITION 167 
poorest compositions in the scale. Each composition is 
rated for “story value” and “form value.” In brief, 
“story value’ means thought content and arrangement 
of ideas. These values numerically are designated as 20, 
30, 40, 50 through 90. “Form value” takes cognizance of 
errors in spelling, punctuation, and syntax. 
The several compositions in the Willing Scale are here 
reproduced:

My antie had her barn trown down last week and had all her 
chickens killed from a storm. Whitch happened at twelve oclock at 
night. She had 30 chickens and one horse the horse was saved he 
ran over to our house and claped on the dor whit his feet. When we 
saw him my father took him in the barn where he slepped the night 
with our horse. When our antie told us about the accident we were 
very sorry the next night all my anties things were frozen. The storm 
blew terrible the next morning and I could not go to school so I had 
to stay home the whole week.

One time mother and father were going to take sister and I for a 
long ride thanksgiving. We had to go 60 miles to get there, When 
sister and I herd about it we were very glad. It was a very cold trip. 
We four all went in a one seated automobile. Dady drove and mother 
held me and sister sat on the top the top was down. Mother could 
not hold sister for she was two heavy. When we got there they had 
a hot fire ready for us and a goose dinner. We were there over night. 
In the morning it was hot out. This was on a farm. Sister and I got 
to go horseback riding. It was lots of funs. They had children. The 
children were very nice. Our trip home was very cold. When we got 
home it had snod.

One time when mother, some girl friends and myself were staying 
up in the mountains. An awful storm came up. At the we were way 
up the mountain. The lightning flashed and the thunder roared. We 
were very frightened for the cabin we were staying at was at the foot 
of the mountain. We didn’t have our coats with us for it was very 
warm when we started. There were a few pine trees near us so we 
ran under them. They didn’t do much good for the rain came down 
in torrents. The rain came down so hard that it uprooted one of the 
trees. Finely it began to slack a little, So we thought we would try 
and go back. About half way down the mountain was a little hut. 
We started and when got about half way down it began to rain all 
the harder. We didn’t know what to do for this time there wasn’t 
any trees to get under. We decided to go on for the nearest shelter 
was the hut. Finely we got there cold and wet to the skin.

When I was in Michegan I had an exciting thing happen or rather 
saw it, it was when the big steamship plying between Chicago and 
Muskegon was sunk about 7 o’clock in the evening. It caught on fire

with a load of cattle and products from the market on board, one of 
the lifeboats carrying some of the people who were on board landed 
at our pier. The “Whaleback” steamer which goes between Chicago 
and Muskegon was two hours later in coming than the freighter and 
was stopped to clear up the wreckage. all of the cattle and products 
and an immense cargo of coal were lost, but there were only two 
people lost. the ship tried hard to get to port with her cargoe but, 
could not reach it. The next morning we found planks, and parts of 
the wreck on the beach. Our cottage was at the top of a cliff and it 
was just one hundred feet to the lake from our cottage, we had a 
beautiful view, and the sight of the fire on the horizon was a beau- 
tiful sight (though it was pitiful).

Near our ranch in Fort Logan there was a chicken ranch. One day 
my sister and I went up to the chicken ranch on our horses. Coming 
back there was a road leading from our house to the main road and 
along this road were half rotted stumps. On every one of these stumps 
what do you think we saw. We saw snakes! snakes! snakes! I sup- 
pose these snakes were shedding their skins, they were of every color, 
shape, and size. But when sister and I saw these snakes we whipped 
our horses into a gallop and away we went just as hard as we could 
go. When we got to the house we went in, and mamma couldn’t 
get us out of the house that day. I was so scared that I believe I 
dreamed about snakes for a month.

The most exciting experience of my life happened when I was five 
years of age. I was riding my tricycle on the top of our high terrace. 
Beside the curbing below, stood a vegetable wagon and a horse. Sud- 
denly I got too near the top of the terrace. The front wheel of my 
tricycle slipped over and down I went, lickety-split, under the horse 
standing by the curbing. I had quite a high tricycle and the handle- 
bars scraped the horse’s stomach, making him kick and plunge in a 
very alarming manner. I was directly under him during this, but 
finally rolled over out of his way and scrambled up. I looked at my 
hands! Most of the first finger and part of the thumb of my left

hand were missing. The horse had stepped on them. I had endured 
no sensation of pain before this, but now my mangled hand began 
to hurt terribly. I was hurried to the hospital and operated on, and 
now you would hardly notice one of my fingers is missing. I certainly 
have good cause to congratulate myself on my good fortune in escap- 
ing with as little injury to myself as I did, for I might have been 
terribly mangled in my head or body.

Standards for Values—The general standards for 
“form and story values” are: 
Story 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 
Form 30 23 17 14 11 8 5 O 
Directions for Using Scale (12).—In using this compo- 
sition scale, these directions should be followed carefully 
because the compositions of the scale were written by 
school children who followed these same directions. 
Securing Compositions—1. The teacher should make 
certain that all pupils are provided with good pen points 
and ink, or well-sharpened pencils, if pencils are to be 
used. Have distributed to each pupil two sheets of 
theme paper (approximately 814x11). It is best to 
use theme paper which has printed at the top the sug- 
gested list of topics. If paper of this kind is not used, 
the teacher must write the following list of topics on the 
blackboard: 
An Exciting Experience. 
A storm. In the mountains. 
An accident. On the ice. 
An errand at night. On the water. 
A wonderful story. A runaway. 
An unexpected meeting. 
In the woods.
-P-A-G-E-189
       COMPOSITION 171 
2. The teacher should then say to the pupils: “I want 
you to write me a story. It is to be a story about some 
exciting experience that you have had, or about some- 
thing very interesting that has happened to you. If 
nothing of the sort has ever happened to you, then tell 
me of an exciting experience someone you know has had. 
You may even make up a story of this kind, if you have 
to, though I believe you will do better, on the whole, 
with a real one. I am going to give you about twenty 
minutes in which to write. You are to write on both 
sides of the paper, to do all the work yourselves, and 
to ask no questions at all after you begin. You may 
make whatever corrections you wish between the lines. 
There will be no time to rewrite your story. 
“The general subject, together with some suggestions, 
is printed at the top of the paper on which you are to 
write. (I have written the general subject on the black- 
board, together with some suggestions.) You do not 
have to write on any of these topics unless you want to; 
they are merely to help out in case you cannot think of 
an exciting experience yourself. You may begin now as 
soon as you wish.” 
8. Allow opportunity for asking questions and make 
an effort to put the children at ease. Allow full twenty 
minutes for the actual writing. At the end of this time 
say to the pupils: 
“You are to have four or five minutes in which to 
finish your stories, make corrections and count the num- 
ber of words written. Write this number at the end of 
your story, write also your name, age and grade.” 
At the end of five minutes collect the papers. 
It is important that the pupils be not allowed to cor- 
rect their compositions, except such corrections as they    
-P-A-G-E-190
  172 DFAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
may make during this period of four or five minutes. 
The teacher must remember that it is this type of com- 
position which was used in making the scale and estab- 
lishing the standards. 
4, In rating the compositions by means of the scale, 
two qualities are recognized: (1) “story value,” and 
(2) “form value.” The composition should be rated for 
“story value’ first. 
Rating for “Story Value.’—Read the compositions, 
neglecting all errors of grammar, punctuation, capitaliza- 
tion, and spelling, and keeping in mind only the value 
of the story which the pupil is telling. As the compo- 
sitions are read, sort them into piles, placing in one pile 
those which most nearly resemble in “story value” com- 
position 20 of the scale; in another pile those which 
most nearly resemble composition 30; in another pile 
those which most nearly resemble composition 40; and 
so on for the other ‘compositions. 
After this is done, compare the compositions in each 
pile with each other, in order to make sure that the rating 
has been done correctly. Make any adjustments which 
you think should be made. Mark each composition with 
the value of the scale composition which it most nearly 
resembles. In case you believe that the true “story 
value” of the pupil’s composition lies between that of 
two of the scale compositions, the interpolated marks, 
25, 35, etc., may be used. 
Rating for “Form Value.”—After the compositions have 
been rated for “story value,” carefully mark all errors in 
grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and _ spelling. 
Count these errors and multiply the total by 100. Divide 
this number by the number of words in the composition. 
This quotient is the index of the “form value.”

       COMPOSITION 173 
The quotient found, as directed above, and the “story 
value” of the composition constitute the pupil’s score. 
These scores are valuable to the teacher. They show 
the standing of each pupil in two respects. They tell the 
teacher whether the pupil needs to give attention to the 
“form” of his writing (grammar, punctuation, capitaliza- 
tion, and spelling) or to the “story value,” or to both. 
Recording the Score—Frequently the teacher or the 
superintendent will wish to know the standing of the class 
as a whole and how it compares with other classes of a 
similar grade. To do this the scores should be tabulated 
as follows, using the class record sheet which is furnished 
with this scale. 
Sort the compositions for a class into piles according 
to their “story value.” (By a class we mean the pupils 
who belong to the same grade and who recite together. . 
If a teacher has a class composed of pupils belonging to 
two grades—say some belonging to 5A and some belong- 
ing to 6B—it will be necessary to make two tabulations. ) 
If interpolated values have been used, they should be 
grouped according to the explanation of the scale value, 
which is given at the top of the scale. 
Take the compositions whose “story value” is 20. 
These are to be listed in the first column of the table in 
the space which corresponds to their “form value.” For 
example, in the first space of this column record the 
number of these compositions whose “form value” is 
between’0 and 2.9; in the second space record the num- 
ber of compositions whose “form value” is between 8 and 
5.9; in the third space record the number of compositions 
whose “form value” is between 6 and 8.9, etc. After the 
compositions in each pile have been recorded in this way,
-P-A-G-E-192
       174 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
the number of compositions recorded on each line should 
be counted and the total entered in the total column. 
The same should be done for the compositions entered 
in each column. 
Using the Willing Scale in Schoolroom Practice. 
Problem: Given a sixth grade of fourteen pupils. What 
is their composition writing ability? What remedial 
measures shall I use to perfect the work of the weak 
students? 
First of all, administer the Willing Scale according 
to the directions reproduced on a previous page. 
In rating compositions for form value it is best to 
count certain types of mistakes. While the teacher is at 
liberty to choose types of mistakes, unless she has in 
mind specific ones, it is suggested that those counted in 
the Gary Survey be employed. This survey counted 
the mistakes here reproduced. 
(a) In capitalization. 
1. Failure to begin a sentence with a capital 
letter. 
2. Failure to capitalize a proper noun. 
8. The capitalization of common nouns. 
(b) In punctuation. 
1. Failure to place a period at the end of a 
sentence. 
2. Failure to place a question mark at the end 
of a question. 
8. Failure to enclose a direct quotation in quo- 
tation marks. 
(c) In syntax. 
1. The use of the wrong case form, as “me and 
him went.”   
-P-A-G-E-193
        
    
                
          
            COMPOSITION 175 
2. The use of one word in place of another, as 
‘Gt would (have) of been.” 
3. Lack of agreement of noun and pronoun, as 
“the pieces were about the size—and it 
break.” 
4, Lack of agreement between subject and verb, 
as “they was.” 
5. Use of the wrong tense form, as “seen” for “saw.” 
6. Use of double negative. 
7. Confusion of dependent and independent 
clauses. 
8. Omission of words essential to the thought, 
or the addition of irrelevant words, as 
“began to chase after (a rabbit, omitted). 
I was a fright to go myself.” 
   Recording the Score—To explain how the scores are 
recorded let us assume that this sixth grade class received 
marks as follows: 
   
       
       
       
            
    Pupil 1 ..2..3.-4 6:36.27 87.9 10, 14,1243 914 
Story value .. 60 45 75 70 80 75 60 65 70 75 80 70 60 65 
Form value .. 9 15 7 6 5 6 12 8 8 7 4 5 10 9            
   How to Enter Scores on Class Record Sheet.—Pupil one 
receives 60 for story value. Find column marked 60. 
His form value score is 9. Find the horizontal column 
9 to 11.9, into which are entered all the 9 “form value” 
scores. By running one finger down column 60 and 
another finger across column 9 the two intersect in a 
certain square. Into the square, at this intersection, is 
recorded one, representing one score of form and story 
values just given. Pupil 2 gets a story value of 45. The
-P-A-G-E-194
176 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
value of 50 is 45-54.9, hence, a story value of 45 is en- 
tered in the 50 column. Pupil 2 gets a form value of 15. 
At the intersection of the 15 and 50 columns the scorer 
enters a score for pupil 2. In like manner all the other 
scores are recorded.

It is very important that the above values be kept in 
mind in interpreting the story value scores assigned to 
each composition and in recording the scores.

Class Median—The class accomplishments in medians 
are not difficult to estimate; but, because of the unusual 
form of the score card, the distributions are here given 
in full.

   It is possible to solve for the median by using the data 
as set down in the score card but care must be exercised 
to count the frequencies from the lowest steps in the 
distributions. The median could as correctly be solved 
by counting frequencies from the upper end of the dis- 
tribution but since this procedure was not developed in 
an early chapter it is best not to attempt the change 
here. 
Standards. Effective comparisons of class accomplish- 
ment cannot be made without standards. The Five 
Kansas Cities standard is used in diagnosing this class. 
It will be noticed that the Five Kansas Cities standard 
is more rigid than the Denver standard. 
Class Diagnosis—Having solved the medians for 
“story value” and “form value” and observed the stand- 
ards for the same, we are prepared to take the next step

  in diagnosing the class results. Employing the principle 
used in the chapter on penmanship we graph the class 
accomplishment. 
The standards, solid lines in Graph XXVIII, divide the 
class into four sections. The class medians fall below 
both standards, consequently the class is weak in both 
“form” and “story” values in composition work. Only 
one pupil, 11, is above standard in both phases of compo- 
sition work. Division I consists of pupils above standard 
in “story value” and below standard in “form value.” 
There are no pupils in this division; however, pupils 
3, 5, 6, 10 are located on the standard. Division II in- 
cludes pupils above standard in both “form” and “story” 
values. Division III consists of pupils who are above 
standard in “form value” but below standard in “story 
value.” In this class there are no representatives from 
Division III. Division IV includes pupils below standard 
in both “form” and “story” values. 
It must be borne in mind that the lower numbers for 
“form value” on the graph indicate high perfection and 
larger numbers as 11, 13, 15, etc., indicate weakness in 
“form value.” This fact accounts for an interpretation 
of the graph in a way not before employed.

Remedial Measures.—One pupil, 11, is above standard; 
pupils 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12 are almost at standard. These 
require no remedial help. The remainder of the class 
constitute the problem which the teacher must: solve. 
Pupil 2 is doing work which is at standard in the grade 
below where he is classified. It might do him more good 
to be demoted to grade five than to remain where he is.

His remedial treatment in grade six should be like that 
accorded to pupils 1, 7, 8, 9, 13, and 14, all of whom are 
below standard in “form value” and “story value.” 
Corrective Work for ‘Story Value’—Remedial work 
should correlate for the improvement of both composition 
values; however, best results will accrue from setting  
-P-A-G-E-198
  180 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
aside certain periods weekly for perfecting “form value” 
and other periods weekly for perfecting “story value.” 
Low story value is the outcome of several neglects by 
teachers, one of the most outstanding being too little or 
ineffective oral composition work. The themes for oral 
composition should be topics which bear a vital signifi- 
cance to the child. 
Suggestive general topics are listed below: 
1. Tell stories of incidents that happen in the classroom. 
2. Reproduce stories read or heard. 
3. Relate interesting incidents—fire, trip, accident, etc. 
4. One minute talks on current events. 
5. Debates (short). 
6. Discuss newspaper cartoons. 
7. Discuss works of art. 
8. Relate original stories based on imagination, pictures, trips, etc. 
9. Geography, history, health, citizenship topics. 
10. Tell how to play a game. 
11. Give directions to follow in testing milk, preparing ground for 
corn planting, in raising chicks, making an apron, or game board, 
working a problem, etc. 
Some works of art which can be used in sixth grade 
oral or written composition are here suggested. 
Plowing—Bonheur. 
Alexander and Diogenes—Landseer. 
The Old Shepherd’s Chief Mourner—Landseer. 
Sir Galahad—Watts. 
Repose in Egypt—Van Dyck. 
Angel Heads—Reynolds. 
The Boy Lincoln—E. Johnson. 
The Torn Hat—Sully. 
Vagabond Musicians—Mazzine. 
The Windmill—Ruysdall. 
Signing of the Declaration of Independence—Trumbull. 
In emphasizing facility of expression, either oral or 
written, a fundamental need to have in mind constantly

is that “The school makes the mistake of thinking it can 
correct bad habits of speech by the application of the 
rules of grammar. The ability to talk correctly comes 
from practice and not from the study of rules.” 
Sheridan in “Speaking and Writing English” empha- 
sizes the observance of the succeeding points in effective 
oral expression. ” 
1. Much opportunity for free self-expression. 
2. Constant attention to matters of voice, enunciation, pronunciation, 
and inflection. 
8. The training of children, by constant themes, to compose oral 
paragraphs upon simple themes, and the development through 
these of some elementary skill in selecting, arranging, and ex- 
pressing their ideas. 
4, Unremitting efforts in all grades to eliminate the common errors 
of speech. 
No piece of oral composition work should be attempted 
without the assistance of some questions, or outlines 
which serve as a guide to the child. 
In grade six two. recitations may profitably be spent 
in preparing a class division for the third day’s work 
in oral composition. 
Written Work.—Written compositions should always 
be preceded by oral work and when written products are 
required the necessary steps for oral composition teach- 
ing should first be observed. 
(a) Letter writing, in all grades, is a practical project. 
After the form of the letter is taught this work should be 
amply motivated. Motivating assignments like those 
listed below are useful. 
1. Write a letter to the superintendent asking for more frequent 
fire drills. 
2. Write a letter to the school board asking them to finance the 
laying out of a tennis court.
-P-A-G-E-200
182 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
3. Write an open letter to the newspaper asking the district to pro- 
vide some playground apparatus. 
4, Write a letter to Mr. asking permission to visit his pure- 
bred stock farm. 
Write a letter to the county agricultural agent inviting him to 
talk to the school on care of chickens. 
Write a letter to a railroad or steamship company asking for 
material to illustrate geography lessons. 
. Write a letter to the county nurse requesting her to talk to the 
school on care of the body. 
. Write a letter to some grade in another state describing an 
industry, as wheat raising in your locality, asking in return for a 
description of some industry in the state of the addressee, as 
coal mining, peach raising, and so on.   
on Do 
Many other subjects might become the themes of real 
letters. Upon receipt of responses letters should follow 
in which acknowledgment is made of the service rendered. 
(b) School journals are a source of delight to children. 
These may be printed, but often printing is impossible, 
in which case the completed edition should be read to 
the school by the children. Later, the issue should be 
posted for an indefinite period. Such journal should 
include compositions of varied types. There should be 
on its pages several news items of general and also local 
character; a number of editorials on topics of immediate 
interest to the pupils; advertisements announcing the 
sale of homemade candy, pigs, snowshoes, a second hand 
rifle, a hunting dog, a sled, a Shetland pony, and other 
items of likely interest to children. A lost-and-found 
column would interest the children. Humor of the school 
room and playground might be included in the publica- 
tion. Another feature of the paper should be a con- 
tinuous story. 
(c) Booklets prepared for classes in citizenship, health, 
history and other subjects, motivate language work. 
The covers should be designed and completed in the  
-P-A-G-E-201
     COMPOSITION 183 
drawing class. Booklets may be illustrated with original 
illustrations or with appropriate clippings from catalogs 
and other sources. In the upper grades simple graphs 
may be used to elaborate the content of the composition. 
(d) Written diaries may be personal or those of great 
men or women. These furnish opportunity not only for 
written expression but also for historical and biographi- 
cal studies. Diaries may be of inanimate things as well 
as of persons. Assignments may be varied, as illustrated 
below: 
1. Make believe you are George Washington; write what he probably 
would have written in telling of his early boyhood. 
2. Play that you are Abraham Lincoln; write what you think he 
would have written on “Books I Like to Read and When I 
Read.” 
3. “I am a bushel of wheat; what happens to me before I am cut 
into bread?” 
4. “I am a puppy (bird dog, water spaniel, deer hound, or rat ter- 
rier). Tell of my adventures until I am full grown.” 
5. “I am a (canary bird, prairie chicken, grouse, partridge or quail) ; 
what did I see happen between spring and winter?” 
Dramatization may be employed for composition pur- 
poses by having children adapt passages for readers. 
Later, such adaptation should be dramatized by the 
class. Certain passages from diaries serve well for 
dramatization. 
Posters are used effectively for conducting citizenship, 
health, English-week and other campaigns. The content 
of such posters can be developed in the composition class. 
Poster subjects appropriate for various purposes are 
listed below: 
1. For citizenship. 
a. “One Flag.” (Picture of flag.) 
b. (Map of United States.) “Fight for Her.”   
 
-P-A-G-E-202

c. “100 Per Cent Americans.” (Picture of children saluting the 
American flag.) 
“Justice Rules the Land.” (Picture of Justice or the scales.) 
“Vote for Those Who Have Character and Fitness for Office.” 
(Picture of ballot box.) 
“Patriots Vote (picture); Slackers Do Not” (picture). 
. “The President Votes, Why Not Dad?” 
. “Obey the Law.” 
“Civic Virtues: Honesty, Obedience, Truthfulness.” (This 
may be the subject of several posters, there being many civic 
virtues.) (Pictures of Lincoln, Washington, etc.) 
2. For health. 
“Drink Milk.” (Picture.) 
“Fresh Air.” (Picture ventilated room.) 
“What Should I Eat?” (Pictures eggs, milk and so on.) 
“Why Not Use This?” (Picture of tooth brush.)

tion.)

Composition Problems.—When it is possible assign the 
composition as a problem. A number of problems have 
been listed above, which, when performed, make moti- 
vated projects, as diaries, journals, dramatization. A 
further extension of problem assignments is listed below: 
1. “I am a bank messenger. I was dispatched to deliver a bag of 
money to the treasurer of a lumber company. As I crossed the 
track in sight of the lumber company’s office, a man stopped me 
at the point of his gun. My faithful bull dog came upon the 
scene.” (Finish the story.) 
*Page 185.

2. A beautiful day—an auto ride—rough stretch of road down the 
hill—high grade below—brake would not work. (Finish the 
story.) 
3. Entered the corral to feed stock—an angry bull—my own riding 
horse nearby. What happened? 
4, Filled the heater with coal—closed it immediately—went to bed. 
What happened? 
Vocabulary—(7) A meagre vocabulary is often the 
cause of poor composition work. The teacher should use 
vocabulary building devices. Vocabulary studies may 
include: 
1. Words individually selected owing to some personal preference 
as. antlered, nodding, crested, allwise, fluttered, radiant, prancing, 
ete. 
2. Groups of words from literary selections. Lists should be made 
by the pupils in their composition books, such as old fashioned 
country-seat, unassuming boy, fingers wandered idly, noisy keys, 
crimson twilight, cheap attire, threadbare sail, embattled farmers, 
hermit souls, solitary way, pathless coast, boundless sky. 
3. Synonyms. Ask, beg, beseech; persuade, entice, urge; pretty, 
beautiful, charming. 
4. Other exercises: 
a. Write lists of words commonly used by a farmer, butcher, 
dressmaker, conductor, cook, engineer. 
b. Write words descriptive of a prairie, sunset, mountain, giant, 
ride, Christmas, vacation, etc. 
The above list of corrective devices is merely sug- 
gestive. 
Remedial Suggestions for Form Value—Form value 
in the Willing Scale includes mistakes in spelling, punc- 
tuation, and syntax. Remedial work for improving 
spelling was discussed in a preceding chapter. 
(a) Punctuation. Dr. Starch (8a) devised a punctua- 
tion scale. It consists of ten steps of four sentences each. 
Though this scale is not devised to indicate which rules 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  186 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
of punctuation are violated, there would be no especial 
difficulty in resolving it into a diagnostic scale from this 
standpoint. With its use the teacher can recognize the 
type errors which the pupils make in punctuation. Un- 
fortunately the scale is standardized only for grade 
seven and above. 
In the absence of a diagnostic test for punctuation 
the teacher can list the typical punctuation errors of 
each pupil, combine them, and drill the class in such 
as are common to the class, and leave for individual 
and group instruction those which are peculiar to indi- 
viduals and groups within the class. 
(b) Syntax. According to Meek (4) most of the 
errors to correct deal with incorrect uses of verbs, pro- 
nouns, and colloquialisms. The type errors noted in the 
Gary Survey, and reproduced on a preceding page, may 
constitute the chief basis of remedial work in improving 
syntax. For this purpose not rules but drill on correct 
forms will be most effective. Games and posters are 
good devices which the teacher may use. 
1. Game to habituate correct use of pronouns. A 
child leaves the room. Teacher or pupil designates one 
pupil as “It,” and gives him a crayon or button, which 
article is placed in the open palm of some child. Palms 
are then closed, children raise heads and open their 
eyes. The child from the outside is admitted, he saying, 
“Have you the crayon?” (pointing). Pupil answers, “It 
is not I; it is she (he).” This continues until the hidden 
object is found. 
2. Posters, bearing sentences like, “It is she,” “He 
and I went,” “It would have been,” “They were,” “I 
saw him,” should be displayed for assistance in correcting 
poor syntax.

  CHAPTER IX 
DIAGNOSIS IN READING 
Questions 
1. In daily life which is used more, oral or silent reading? 
2. A teacher who does not believe in tests says, “I can find weak- 
nesses in my reading class without the use of educational tests.” Can 
she? If so, about how long will it take to discover such weaknesses? 
3. Another teacher uses standardized reading tests which disclose 
class and individual weaknesses. How long does it take her to discover 
these? Which discoveries are more accurate, reliable, and immediate? 
4, Effective silent reading is measurable for rate and comprehension 
of the passages read. Without the use of a standardized test, how can 
a teacher discover the speed with which a pupil reads or how well 
he understands what is read? 
5. What are the standards by which a teacher can judge whether 
she uses effective methods in reading? 
6. Is it possible to select specific reading methods to correct specific 
reading weaknesses? Justify your answer. 
Oral and Silent Reading—It was not many years ago 
when oral reading was stressed more than silent reading. 
The educational philosophy of today considers this an 
error. In the first two grades of the elementary school 
no more emphasis now is placed on silent reading than 
on oral but in the grammar grades we today emphasize 
silent reading. Silent reading receives gradually more 
attention with each succeeding grade above the second. 
The increased stress in silent reading grows out of the 
life situations of one time elementary school students. 
Actual life situations call for but little oral reading. In 
the home we read aloud:infrequently. The greater part 
189
-P-A-G-E-208
190 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
of each daily paper is read in silence, as are books, maga- 
zine articles, and continued stories. To every page of 
oral reading in out of school life, there are read dozens 
of pages silently. Since silent reading serves us so exten- 
sively, one large problem of the school is to develop 
speedy, understanding readers. There must be found 
ways of doing this and ways of testing progress in speed 
and understanding. 
Advent of Tests——After the idea of absolute measure- 
ment was introduced into education, scientific studies in 
this field yielded measures with which to study accurately 
class room work. These studies are in the form of tests 
and scales. Numerous tests and scales have been devised 
with which teaching and supervision can be made really 
effective. To make the teaching of reading more effec- 
tive than it was before the advent of educational tests, 
Professor Monroe devised his Standardized Tests in 
Silent Reading. These tests are based on the new 
philosophy of teaching reading. When used on a class 
they disclose the speed in reading and the understanding 
of the printed page. They record two sets of scores for 
the class and the individual, namely rate scores and com- 
prehension scores. Doctors Haggerty, Gray, Starch, 
Thorndike, Dean Fordyce, Miss Burgess, and others, have 
contributed to this field of educational research. 
General and Diagnostic Tests.—To a certain extent, all 
tests enable an examiner to disclose class weaknesses 
through test results; however, some tests assist so 
materially in pointing out the strengths and weaknesses 
of a class that such are classed as diagnostic to distin- 
guish them from the less diagnostic or general test. 
Thus, Monroe’s Standardized Silent Reading Test, Re- 
vised, may disclose that nine pupils rank low in both 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
READING 191 
rate and comprehension in reading, but this test does 
not disclose the special weaknesses responsible for low 
rate and comprehension. Supplementary tests and a 
further study of these children will reveal the exact 
difficulties. Subsequent tests are usually chosen for their 
distinctly diagnostic character. 
Problem: J wish to give the Monroe Standardized 
Silent Reading Test, Revised, in order to discover the 
rate and comprehension of my reading class. How shall 
I proceed? 
Procure Material—The Monroe Tests, Revised, can be 
had from various distributors. (See Appendix.) These 
tests are devised in Forms 1, 2, and 3. Form 1 may be 
used at one time of the year and Form 2 at another. All 
forms in this test are of equal difficulty. The advantage 
of more than one form lies in the fact that the same 
material need not be used with the same pupils in the 
span of a few months. Test I in either form is used in 
Grades 3, 4, and 5; Test II, in Grades 6, 7, and 8; Test 
III, in Grades 9, 10, 11, and 12. 
Directions in Using Tests—(a) General. There are 
certain general directions which should be observed in 
using tests. (1) Follow the printed directions on the test 
implicitly. Do no more nor less than the directions re- 
quire. Ifa time limit of 4 minutes is allowed, this means 
4 minutes exactly, not even five or ten seconds overtime 
are permissible. (2) Know the test before giving it. 
Study it carefully. (3) To give the test correctly give it 
first to a friend for practice purposes. (4) Do not give 
a test too soon after or before exciting events occur. A 
test given soon before or after an examination, a play, 
a celebration which interests the children, is likely to 
bring unfair results. During the test and just before,
-P-A-G-E-210
  192 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
keep the children at ease. (5) Most tests should be given 
about three times a year; they should be given at least 
twice. The second and the third tests are given to 
enable the teacher to estimate the progress of the class. 
The end of September, the middle of January, and the 
middle of April, are suitable times to administer the 
tests. However, if tests are given twice a year, the Janu- 
ary test should be omitted. For distinctly diagnostic 
purposes, necessity requires administering a test at any 
time. 
(b) Specific. These vary with each kind of test given. 
Accompanying each test are explicit directions on using 
the tests. The Monroe Standardized Silent Reading 
Tests Revised contain directions and instructions for 
using the tests, on the front page. The page and the 
test are reproduced on succeeding pages. 
In giving the test it is well to put down the exact 
time at the expiration of the 4 minutes allowed for the 
test; if testing begins at 9:20, then put down 9:24 as 
the time limit. In using a stop watch this is unnecessary. 
Immediately the time expires pencils are placed on the 
desk. The papers are then collected. 
The examiner next scores the papers. There are two 
scores, one for rate of reading, the other for compre- 
hension. The rate values, designated by figures, are 
indicated at the left hand side of the exercises which the 
pupil did correctly and represents also the number of the 
exercise. 
Directions for Scoring Test Papers.—These directions 
appear on the reverse side of the Class Record Sheet 
which is used with the Monroe Silent Reading Test, 
Revised. The correct answers to the exercises are printed 
beneath the directions for scoring the test papers.

(a) Marking Papers. Suppose that the pupil under- 
lined “swan” in Exercise 1; that the pupil underlined 
“grandmother” in Exercise 2; that the pupil underlined 
“happy” in Exercise 3; that the pupil underlined “tree” 
in Exercise 4; and that the pupil underlined “hay” in 
Exercise 5. 
The correct answers submitted by Monroe for Test 1, 
Form 1, are: 
1. swan 7. mother 13. wet 
2. grandmother 8. butterfly 14. insects 
3. happy 9. cross 15. foolish 
4. roof 10. earth 16. spring 
5. hay 11. unhappy 17. severe 
6. dog 12. autumn 
Comparing the answer submitted by the pupil to 
Exercise 1 with the correct answer given by Monroe, 
results in a correct mark for Exercise 1. Comparing the 
pupil’s answer to 2 with the Monroe answer, results in a 
correct mark for Exercise 2. Making similar comparisons 
with the pupil’s answers to Exercises 3, 4, and 5 and the 
correct answers supplied by Monroe, results in a correct 
mark for Exercises 3 and 5 and an incorrect answer 
to Exercise 4. Should all the exercises in Test 1 be 
answered by the child, they would all be marked as were 
the few above. 
(b) Rate. First, let us estimate the rate of reading. 
Since the pupil read Exercise 5, the supposition is that 
all the exercises to the sixth were read, so the rate value 
of this pupil’s work is the accumulated total of Exercise 
5 or 243. If the pupil answered the first ten exercises 
only, the rate value would be the accumulated total of 
Exercise 10 or 500, even if several of the exercises had 
been incorrectly answered. We assume that every exer-
-P-A-G-E-216
  198 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
cise read helps to determine the total rate value regardless 
of the correctness of the answers. In this instance the 
accumulated totals are: 
Exercise Total Accumulated 
1 45 
  The rate value of this pupil is 243 words read in 4 
minutes. Since comparisons are made on the basis of 
words read per minute, then we divide the accumulated 
total by 4 to get the rate. The rate of this pupil per 
minute is 60.7. The division computations may be 
avoided by using Table XLIV. In this table accumulated 
totals (A. T.) are written in the left hand column. At 
a glance, without repeated division the teacher using the 
Monroe Silent Reading Test Revised can get the rate. 
Thus, if the accumulated total is 140, we run down the 
first column to 140 and the next number across from it, 
or 35, is the rate; if the accumulated total is 344 the rate 
is 86, and so on. 
In the upper right hand corner of the first page of the 
Monroe Silent Reading Test Revised is a blank space 
wherein is written the rate score, in this instance 60.7.

Following the same principle, mark all the exercises 
of the pupils taking the test. Let us presume that 10 
pupils in grade V took the test with results recorded in 
the upper right hand corner of each paper, and that the 
pupil’s results are as written in Table XLV. The next 
step consists of finding the median.

supplies one on the Class Record Sheet. The sheet is 
reproduced on page 201.

across the distribution table for rate, at 137, to represent 
graphically the standard, and mark this “S.” Draw 
another horizontal line to represent the median and 
mark it “M.” These lines represent the actual accom-

data from the upper right hand corner of each paper 
after the papers were arranged in the order of their 
comprehension scores, the smallest score at the top. The 
proper order of the pupils’ papers is given in Table 
XLVII. 
The median for comprehension is next recorded 
graphically as was done with the median for rate. The 
standard for comprehension is also designated in the 
distribution table. 
It is of prime importance in using tests to interpret 
results. Later on in this chapter due attention will be 
given to interpreting test results. 
Starch Reading Tests—(23) The educational philoso- 
phy underlying the Starch Silent Reading Tests is 
practically the same as that underlying the Monroe Re- 
vised Reading Tests. However, a very commendable 
feature of the Starch test is emphasis upon testing para- 
graph reading. In public school work evidences of ability 
in reading must, in the very nature of things, be judged 
by a speedy and an understanding perusal of paragraph 
upon paragraph of assigned readings, required for 
history, geography, hygiene, and other subjects. It has 
been observed that good reading of classic literature is 
no proof of a passable reading of mathematics, science, 
history, and so on. To date no tests have been devised   
-P-A-G-E-222
   
    204 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
which measure a pupil’s reading ability in these fields. 
A want of such tests is felt. But a test of ability to 
understand paragraph content is eminently desirable. 
While emphasizing this, Dr. Starch stresses speed and 
comprehension in reading. The tests are read silently 
for 30 seconds. On the basis of the time element and 
the number of words read in that time the administrator 
of the test can determine the number of words read by 
the pupil in one second. This gives the speed. Imme- 
diately after reading for 30 seconds the pupil is instructed 
to reproduce on the reverse side of the test what he has 
read. The material reproduced on the reverse side of the 
test paper ¢yves the comprehension score. Dr. Starch’s 
tests consist of nine passages so selected experimentally 
that each succeeding one is a step more difficult than the 
preceding one. The tests are numbered 1 to 9. Test 1 
is intended for Grade 1, Test 2 for Grade 2, and so on, 
except that for high school use, tests 8 and 9 or 7 and 9 
may be used. Several of the tests follow. (Pages 205-6.) 
Directions for Using Tests—(a) General. The same 
general instructions should be observed in using the 
Starch tests as are outlined for using the Monroe tests. 
(b) Specific Instructions. The directions may be given 
to the children as follows: 
(This is an elaboration of the directions as suggested 
by Dr. Starch.) “Children, I hold in my hand some 
blanks on one side of which is printed a short story (or 
part of story, as the case may be). I shall hand these 
stories to you, the printed side down. By having you 
read these stories I shall try to find out how fast you can 
read and how well you understand what you read. After 
you get these stories do not turn them over until I tell 
you to do so. You will be given exactly one-half a

Once upon a time, there lived a very rich man, and a king be- 
sides, whose name was Midas; and he had a little daughter, 
whom nobody but myself ever heard of, and whose name I either 
never knew, or have entirely forgotten. So, because I love odd 
names for little girls, I choose to call her Marygold. 
This. King Midas was fonder of gold than anything else in the 
world. He valued his royal crown chiefly because it was com- 
posed of that precious metal. If he loved anything better, or 
half so well, it was the one little maiden who played so merrily 
around her father’s footstool. But the more Midas loved his 
daughter, the more did he desire and seek for wealth. He 
thought, foolish man! that the best thing he could possibly do 
for his dear child would be to give her the immensest pile of yel- 
low, glistening coin, that had ever been heaped together since 
the world was made. Thus, he gave all his thoughts and all his 
time to this one purpose. If ever he happened to gaze for an 
instant at the goldtinted clouds of sunset, he wished that they 
were real gold, and that they could be squeezed safely into his 
strong box. When little Marygold ran to meet him, with 3 
bunch of buttercups and dandelions, he used to say, ‘‘Poh, poh, 
child! If these flowers were as golden as they look, they would 
be worth the plucking!’’ 
And yet, in his earlier days, before he was so entirely pos- 
sessed of this insane desire for riches, King Midas had shown 
8 great taste for flowers.

In a secluded and mountainous part of Stiria there was in old 
time a valley of the most surprising and luxuriant fertility. It 
was surrounded on all sides by steep and rocky mountains, ris- 
ing into peaks which were always covered with snow, and from 
which a number of torrents descended in constant cataracts 
One of these fell westward over the face of a crag so high that, 
when the sun had set to everything else, and all below was dark- 
ness, his beams still shone full upon this waterfall, so that it 
looked like a shower of gold. It was, therefore, called by the 
people of the neighborhood, the Golden River. It was strange 
that norie of these streams fell into the valley itself. They all 
descended on the other side of the mountains, and wound away 
through broad plains and past populous cities. But the clouds 
were drawn so constantly to the snowy hills, and rested so softly 
in the circular hollow, that in time of drought and heat, when 
all the country round was burnt up, there was still rain in the 
little valley; and its crops were so heavy and its hay so high, 
and its apples so red, and its grapes so blue, and its wine so 
tich, and its honey so sweet, that it was a marvel to everyone 
who beheld it, and was commonly called the Treasure Valley. 
The whole of this little valley belonged to three brothers 
ealled Schwartz, Hans and Gluck. Schwartz and Hans, the 
two elder brothers, were very ugly men, with overhanging 
eyebrows and small dull eyes.

minute to read as much of the story as you can finish 
in that time. Perhaps you cannot read the entire story 
in 30 seconds but read all that you can. Do not read 
anything over again but read as fast as you can and try 
to remember what you read. You will begin to read 
when I say, “Turn papers, start.” When I say “Stop” 
then draw a line in the same way as I show on the black- 
board, after the last word you read. (The line here 
referred to is a vertical one after the last word read.) 
After you have read for 30 seconds I shall ask you to 
write on the blank side of the paper what you remember 
of the story. Have you any questions to ask about what 
you should do?” At this point answer such questions 
as pertain to the directions. These questions being 
answered and all pencils being in readiness, distribute 
the papers to the pupils, face down, the top of the test 
being farther away from the pupil so that after the blank 
is turned over, it will be in position for immediate read- 
ing. The directions may now continue thus, the teacher 
holding watch in hand to allow only 30 seconds for the 
reading: “Turn papers, start.” At the end of 30 
seconds exactly, say “Stop, draw line after last word 
you read. Put pencils down. Now, turn the paper 
over as it was when first placed on your desk. Write 
what you remember of the story. For this you have as 
much time as you need.” In the reproduction note care- 
fully that the pupils do not copy from one another, that 
they do not exchange ideas, or that they do not consult 
the face of the blank. After they have finished the re- 
production require them to fill in name, grade, etc., at 
the bottom of the story. 
On the next day repeat the test in the same manner, 
but use the blank of the next grade below yours, that

The teacher now has in her possession papers from 
two days’ work, two papers from each pupil. Sort the 
papers so each pupil’s efforts immediately follow each 
other in the pile. 
Instructions for Scoring the Test-Speed—The tests 
score for two elements in reading, speed and compre- 
hension. To economize time, let the teacher take a blank 
of each kind used and let her number all the words from 
the beginning to the end of the blank. This she may 
use as a “key” for speed. Her “key” will look like this 
sample. 
“Key.”—“In 1 a 2 secluded 3 and 4 mountainous 5 part 
6 of 7 Stiria 8 there 9 was 10 in 11 old 12 times 13 a 14 
valley 15 of 16 the 17 most 18 surprising 19 and 20

on 26 all 27 sides 28 by 29 steep 30 and 31 rocky 32 
mountains, 33 rising 34 into 35 peaks 36 which 37 were 
38 always 39 covered 40 with 41 snow 42, and 43 from 
44 which 45 a 46 number 47 of 48 torrents 49 descended 
50 in 51 constant 52 cataracts 53.” This “key” may be 
extended to suit the examiner’s needs. 
Using “Key.”—By comparing the pupils’ paper with the 
key, and observing the position of the vertical line on 
this paper, the teacher can immediately tell how many 
words the child had read. To facilitate future work, 
let the teacher record this speed in the upper right hand 
corner of the test thus: ‘“S-82,” which means that the 
child’s speed is 82 words in 30 seconds. By consulting 
Table XLVIII, since the speed total is 82 words, his 
speed per second is 2.73 words. Write 2.73 after “S-82.”

Table XLVIII, which may be used to save much simple

that point and ends with 153 words. It may be easily 
extended to any desired length. The table is interpreted 
thus: If the pupil reads 10 words in 30 seconds he reads 
.33 words per second; if 11 words in 30 seconds, he reads 
.36 words per second; if 23 words in 30 seconds, he reads 
.76 words per second; if 40 words in 30 seconds, he reads 
1.33 words per second; and so on. 
Having scored the first paper for speed, score the 
second in the same way. Suppose that the score on the 
second reads “S-78-2.60.” The score for speed of this 
pupil is the average of 2.73 and 2.60 or 2.66 words read 
per second. The average for speed should be re- 
corded on one of the blanks submitted, perhaps thus: 
“Ave.-2.66.” All the other papers are marked for speed 
in the same way. 
Starch Standards.—These were derived from tests made 
of approximately 6,000 children and are reproduced 
below. These are standards for ends of respective years. 
Since the standard for the third grade in May is 2.1, the 
standard of a fourth grade in the early fall is 2.1; since 
the standard of a fifth grade at the end of the year is 
2.8, the standard of a sixth grade in September is 2.5; 
etc. The other standards in speed and in comprehension 
are interpreted in the same way.

Comprehension—Let us go back again, now to study 
comprehension. Each test referred to previously has a 
story reproduced on the reverse side. From this repro- 
duction is obtained the comprehension of each child. 
“Comprehension is determined by counting the number

of words written which correctly reproduce the thought. 
The written account is carefully read, and all words 
which either reproduce the ideas of the test passage in- 
correctly or repeat ideas previously recorded are crossed 
out. The remaining words are counted and are used as 
the index of comprehension. The average of the two 
tests per pupil is taken as the final score. On an aver- 
age about 7 per cent of the words written need to be 
discarded (23).1 
Suppose the pupil reproduced Test No. 3 in these 
words: 
“Abe ran home. He ran slowly. He wore a suit and 
coonskin cap with a tassel. He carried home a book 
when he ran home slowly.” Since the child repeats in 
the last sentence, some words are crossed out, giving him 
a comprehension of 21 words written. Immediately 
below the speed score, this comprehension score should 
be recorded thus, “C-21.” On the second paper sub- 
mitted by this pupil, should be recorded, after it is 
determined, the comprehension value of that paper. If 
the comprehension scores on the two papers are “C-21” 
and “C-23,” the child’s final score is the average or

For purposes of further illustration, let us assume that 
the average scores in comprehension for this third grade 
are as recorded on page 213. 
The median in comprehension is 21.25; the standard is 
24, hence the class is below standard in comprehension 
in reading. 
Having made comparison with the standards in speed 
and comprehension, we are at the point where diagnostic 
and remedial measures would logically follow, but these 
are deferred until later.

and Sigma 3 (grades V-XII). Sigma 2 (grades III-VIII) 
is in preparation. 
(a) Sigma 1 combines a reading test with an intelli- 
gence test. It is composed of two parts with a prelim- 
inary fore-exercise to each of them. The pupil is not 
required to do any writing; all answers are indicated with 
lines or simple marks. Sigma 1 can be very easily 
administered. Directions for giving the test are fully 
printed in the “Manual of Directions.” The scoring is 
simplified through the use of an answer card, or 
“Scoring Key.” The standards are based on the results 
of testing 6000 children in seven large cities of the east 
and middle west. The grade and age standards are 
reproduced below.

measure of present achievement.” + 
(b) Sigma 3. Some reading tests measure a child on 
ability to read sentences only; others to read paragraphs. 
Haggerty’s Sigma 3 combines these desirable test fea- 
tures and adds a vocabulary feature. This makes a very 
desirable combination for measuring reading ability. 
Sigma 3 consists of three tests, each of which is preceded 
by a fore-exercise for practice purposes that the child 
may be briefly coached before undertaking the test. The 
vocabulary test, Test 1, consists of fifty well chosen 
words, the definition for each of which is to be indicated 
by underlining the proper words in parenthesis. The 
sentence test, Test 2, consists of numerous sentences, 
each of which is answerable by underlining “Yes” or 
“No.” Paragraph reading, Test 3, consists of paragraphs, 
all except one, chosen from widely used school readers. 
Sigma 3 is easy to administer, and through the use of 
a “key” also easy to score.

appears on the following pages. 
Accompanying Test 1 is a list of printed questions, 
the answers to which constitute the quality (compre-

The Burgess Scale for Measuring Ability in Silent Read- 
ing (5) consists of four picture supplements, P. 8. 1, 2, 3, 
and 4 of equal difficulty, any one of which may be used 
for testing purposes. Each picture supplement consists 
of twenty illustrated paragraphs. The examinee is re- 
quired to follow the directions of the paragraph by 
adding to or indicating in some way on the picture his 
answer. The things which the child is asked to do are 
always simple. Any crudeness in drawings is overlooked 
for the Burgess Scale is not an exercise in art. The 
vocabulary employed in the supplements is that of 
ordinary newspaper English. “The scale calls for reading 
with careful attention to details, and the pupil is required 
to read each paragraph well enough to follow its instruc- 
tions correctly.”

  218 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
“Giving the Tests. 1. See that each child has a pencil and that the 
teacher has a watch. 2. Distribute scales, face down. 3. Have chil- 
dren write on backs of sheets their names, grade, and date. 4. Tell 
children they are to have a test in reading. Hold scale up and explain 
that each paragraph tells them to do something to the picture above 
it with their pencils. They must read carefully, to make sure just 
what they are to do. They are to read and mark the paragraphs in 
order, starting at the top and working down, through the first, second, 
third, and so on. They must do as many as they can in five minutes. 
5. Make sure that the pupils understand, then tell them to turn 
papers over and begin. Allow exactly five minutes. Collect papers. 
“Marking the Papers. Count every paragraph correct in which the 
marking, no matter how crude it may be, exactly follows instructions. 
Count every paragraph wrong in which the marking does not exactly 
follow instructions. Remember this is a test of reading, not of draw- 
ing. The pupil’s score is the number of paragraphs correctly marked. 
Write this number at the top of the paper. 
“Giving Credit. The credit to be assigned in each grade for each 
number of paragraphs correctly marked is shown in the table (below). 
A third grade child having ten paragraphs right should be marked 80, 
a fourth grade child having seven right, 50, and so on. Credits in 
table are for February 1. To adjust for other periods add or subtract 
from each child’s mark as follows:

Narcissus* 
Once upon a time, long, long ago, there lived in 
a far-away land, called Greece, a young shepherd 
named Narcissus. All day long he minded his 
sheep on the hills of Greece, and drove them from 
place to place to find the very best pasture. One 
day the sheep stopped to drink from a little 
stream. The water in this stream was so clear 
that it was like a great looking-glass, and reflected 
everything that leaned over it. Now it happened 
that while Narcissus was waiting for the sheep to 
drink, he chanced to see his own face in this 
wonderful stream. He had never seen his likeness 
before, and he was so pleased with the pretty 
picture that he looked, and looked, and looked at 
it in the water, and forgot all about his sheep. 
The sheep waited for a long time near the stream, 
but at last they wandered away without the shep- 
herd and were lost. Jupiter, the great god of

that country, was very angry with Narcissus for 
forgetting his sheep, and made up his mind to 
punish him. So when Narcissus had looked at 
himself long enough and turned to go after his 
flock, he found that his feet had taken root in 
the earth. He could not move from the side of 
the stream. He could not lift his head, but must 
keep it bent down as when he was looking at the 
reflection of his face in the water. Little by little, 
he changed into the flower that we know so well, 
the Narcissus. Now do you see why it is that we 
find this dainty flower growing on the bank of a 
stream and always with its pretty head hung 
down? (Now turn the paper over and lay it down

Gray’s Oral Reading Paragraphs constitute an individ-

They not only measure oral reading ability but also dis- 
close types of weaknesses needing correction. These 
paragraphs are designed for use in grades I to VIII.

The first page of the test contains blanks for the child 
to fill out and also “Directions to the Teacher” which 
are: “Each child should be tested apart from the others 
in a room by himself. Give him an unused folder. Take 
another folder and fill in the above blanks before begin- 
ning the reading. As the child reads, record his efforts, 
using the marks presented on the class record sheet, and 
following the directions printed there as accurately as 
possible.” On the remaining pages are printed the 
twelve paragraphs. A few of them are here reproduced.

Once there lived a king and a queen in a large palace. But the 
king and queen were not happy. There were no little children in the 
house or garden. One day they found a poor little boy and girl at 
their door. They took them into the beautiful palace and made them 
their own. The king and queen were then happy.

  DIRECTIONS FOR oa GRAY’S ORAL READING 
EST 
1. Each pupil should be tested individually ina quiet place, 
free from distraction; and where other pupils to be tested will 
not hear the reading. 
2. Hand the pupil a copy of the standardized paragraphs 
and give the foltowing directions: “I should like for you to read. 
some of these paragraphs for me. Begin with the first paragraph 
when I say ‘Begin’. Stop at the end of each paragraph until I 
say ‘Next’. If you should find some hard words, read them as 
best you can without help and continue reading.” Pupils above 
the fourth grade should begin with paragraph 4. If two or more 
errors are made in this paragraph, ask the pupil to read the pre- 
ceding paragraphs also. In case pupils in the first two grades 
hesitate several seconds: on a difficult word, pronounce it for the 
pupil and mark‘ it as mispronounced. 
3. While the pupil is reading, record :(a) the time required. 
to read each paragraph, and (b) the errors made. 
(a) Note the exact second at which the pupil begins and 
completes the reading of a paragraph. Record the number of 
seconds required in the margin to the right of the paragraph. 
(b) The following paragraph illustrates the character of 
errors and the method of recording them. 
The sun pierced into my large.windows. It was the opening of October, 
and aga was Ga dazzling blue. I looked out of my window Gnd)down 
the street. Thg white housefof-the long, s@uight street were most painful 
to the eyes. The clear‘atmosphere allowed full piay tothe swp’s brightness. 
If a word is wholly mispronounced, underline -it as in the, 
case of.“Atmosphere.” If a portion of a word is mispronounced, 
mark appropriately as indicated above: “pierced” pronounced in. 
two syllables, sounding long a in “dazzling,” omitting thes in 
“houses” or the a? from “almost,” or the r in “straight.” Omitted 
words aré marked as im the case of “of” and “and”; substitutions 
as in the case of “many” for “my”; insertions as in the case of 
“clear”; and repetitions as in the case of “to the sun’s.” Two or 
more words should be repeated to count as a repetition. 
It is very difficult to record the exact nature of each error} 
Do this as nearly as you'can. In all cases where you are unable 
to define clearly the specific character of the error, underline the 
word or portion of the word mispronounced. Be sure you put 
down a mark for each error.» In.case you are not sure that an 
error was made, give the pupil the benefit of the doubt. If the 
pupil has a slight foreign accent, distinguish carefully between 
this difficulty- and real errors.

DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING OUT SCORE SHEET FOR 
GRAY’S ORAL READING TEST* 
1. Use one score sheet for each grade. Score the results for 
each paragraph through the use of the following table (Table I). 
The numbers in the left-hand column refer to the number of 
seconds required to read a paragraph. The numbers in the 
horizontal line at the top of the table refer to the number of 
errors made in reading. , The numbers in the horizontal line to 
the.right of “40 or more” mean that if a paragraph is read.in 40 
or more seconds with no errors a credit of 4 is given; with 1. 
error, a credit of 4; with 2 errors, a-credit of 3; with 3 errors; 
a credit of 2; etc.

To find the score for a given paragraph note the time required 
to read it and the number of.errors made. For illustration, par>’ 
agraph 1 may be read by pupil A in 34 seconds with 3 errors: 
«In-the left-hand column of Table I find the intervai con- 
taining 34 seconds. Evidently it is the interval 30-39. 
Follow the horizontal line of numbers to the right of 30-39 
to the column which represents 3 errors. The score indicated 
there is 2. 
Enter this score on the Score Sheet in the column for para- 
graph 1, opposite the reader’s name. 
The score for each paragraph. should be determined and 
entered in the same way. Make no entry on the Score Sheet if 
the score is 0. 
2. Proceed as follows to find the average class score: 
(a) Find the sum of the scores for each paragraph and enter 
each total at the foot of the appropriate column on the Score

Sheet. 
(b) Enter these total scores in column t of Table II (see 
below) and opposite the proper paragraph numbers. 
(c) The value or credit given for successful reading of each 
paragraph after the first is the same no matter what grade the 
pupils belong to. These values are printed in column 2 of Table 
II. But paragraph 1 has different values according to grade. 
Using the data to the right of Table II, enter the grade value for 
paragraph 1 in the blank space left for it at the top in column 
Thus, if scores are being made for Grade_I, the proper value 
to enteris.55; if for Grade II, 35; etc.

3. Individual scores may be found as follows: 
(a) Construct tables like Table II. 
(b). Enter paragraph ‘scores in column 2. 
(c) Proceed as in (c) and (d) above. 
(d) Divide the sum of the products by 4. The result is the 
individual score. 
(e) The average class score may be found by finding the 
average of the individual scores. 
*Because the maximum score for each paragraph is 4. If 
each pupil scored “4” the class score would be the sum of the

Illustrating How to Fill Score Sheet.—To further illus- 
trate the correct use of the Gray Oral Reading Test, let 
us suppose that it is given to six pupils in grade IV. 
According to the directions the teacher makes a record 
of the length of time required by a pupil to read each 
paragraph. She also designates the errors and the total 
number of them. A hypothetical fourth grade class gets

Problem: To find scores for each paragraph and enter 
them on a record sheet. 
Agnes read Test 4 in 21 seconds without making any 
errors; she read Test 5 in 22 seconds, making one error, 
and so on. Gladys read as follows: the fourth in 23 sec- 
onds with one error; the fifth in 24 seconds with two 
errors, and so on. Test 10 was not attempted because 
each of the pupils made seven or more errors in Tests 
8 and 9. 
In making score sheet records, observe directions for 
making out score sheet, Part 1. Since Agnes made no 
errors in reading Test 4 in 21 seconds, according to 
Table 1 of directions, we enter 4 under paragraph 4, 
opposite her name. Since she read Test 5 in 22 seconds 
with 1 error, according to Table 1, her score is 4, which 
is entered opposite her name on the class record sheet. 
In like manner scores for paragraphs 6 and 7 are deter- 
mined. No score is entered for paragraphs 8 or 9 for the 
score on each is 0, and directions forbid entering 0 scores. 
Following the directions, Gladys makes scores which 
are entered on the record sheet. Burton, Avis, Myrtie, 
Claire, also earn scores which are properly recorded. 
Now, we are in possession of data which enables finding 
the average class score. 
To Find Average Class Score——Since paragraph 4 was 
answered with a resulting score of 4, or practical per- 
fection, the presumption is that the preceding three 
paragraphs receive a perfect score each. Adding the 
scores of the six pupils, for the first paragraph, yields a 
total of 24. Similar additions of scores on the other 
paragraphs yield total scores of 24, 24, 24, 21, 20, and 15 
for paragraphs 2 to 7. 
The total scores are now entered in Table II, column 1

The values or credits for reading successfully each

grade the pupil belongs. These values are printed in 
column 2 Table II of directions. The values for para- 
graph 1 are printed at the right of Table II. They are 
also given above at the right. Paragraph 1 is assigned 
a value of 25 for the fourth grade. 
To get the product of the score and value, data needed 
in column 3, we perform the necessary multiplications 
opposite paragraphs 1 to 7 and record the products in 
column 3. 
The average ¢lass score is next obtained. First add 
the products in column 3. In this instance their sum is 
1240. Then divide this by 4 times the number of pupils 
in the class.

How to Find Individual Scores.—Since one of the main 
reasons for administering the Gray Oral Reading Test 
is to diagnose special difficulties of individual pupils, 
it is important that the teacher knows how to score 
individuals in a class. For this purpose use a table like 
the one on page 228. The paragraph scores earned by 
Agnes are recorded in column 1 opposite the paragraphs 
she read, and which entitled her to a score above 0. On 
the first six paragraphs her score is 4; on paragraph 7 
her score is 3. No 0 scores are recorded. The products 
of the score and value are next recorded and added. 
The average pupil score is obtained by dividing the total 
product by four times the number of pupils. The test 
results of the above pupil are tabulated below:

Gray’s Test being diagnostic ind individual, it is pref- 
erable to use it not on the class as a whole, but upon 
the members who evidence low reading ability and are 
a drag on the progress of the class. Through use of the 
test, a pupil’s errors of mispronunciation, entire or 
partial omissions, substitutions, insertions, and repeti- 
tions, are located. Knowledge of such weaknesses makes 
possible the use of special correctives by the teacher.

    USING TESTS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Let us assemble all the above academic discourse about 
tests and diagnosis with a view to application on real 
schoolroom conditions. 
Monroe Reading Test, Revised—This test was adminis- 
tered to 37 pupils in Grade III, Garfield School, Aber- 
deen, South Dakota.1' After collecting the papers they 
were evaluated for both rate and comprehension. The 
class record sheet was then filled for rate and comprehen- 
sion scores of Sections A and B of the class. Medians 
were obtained as follows:

and a comprehension of 7, hence her name is written into 
the graph at the dot, which is the intersection of these 
two values. In the same way, from the data on each 
paper submitted by the pupils, were located all the pupils 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  234 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
represented in Graph XXX. The medians and standards 
were next appropriately represented. 
Interpreting Results—The standards, medians, and 
correct location of each pupil, as indicated in the graph, 
disclose the ability of the class as a whole, and of the 
individual members of the class. The standards divide 
the graph into four rectangles. The upper right hand 
rectangle includes children of Division I, which group is 
above standard in both rate and comprehension in read- 
ing; the lower right hand rectangle includes the children 
of Division II, which group is above standard in rate 
but below standard in comprehension in reading. The 
pupils in Division III are below standard in both rate 
and comprehension, and those of Division IV are below 
standard in rate and above standard in comprehension. 
Remedial Measures.—(a) Administrative. The reading 
ability of this class can now be diagnosed from the stand- 
point of administration and corrective teaching. Admin- 
istratively, some pupils are in line for promotion ahead 
of their fellows, some may be in danger of demotion, 
most of them need special help from their teacher, and 
some are fit candidates to enroll, temporarily, in the 
opportunity room. 
(b) Supplementary and Library Reading. Certainly 
the entire class needs encouragement to do a maximum 
amount of reading. This reading should be done from 
the text, in part. Supplementary reading should be 
encouraged. The reading of well selected library books 
suitable for a third grade will be a great help. The 
public library should codperate with the teacher in pro- 
moting library reading. In most branches of study, pub- 
lic library books give academic information which aptly 
supplements the text book. Since the pupils get credit
-P-A-G-E-253
     READING 235 
for mastering the contents of text books, which include 
some academic knowledge, these same children should 
get some credit for mastering academic knowledge ob- 
tained from other sources, such as library books. 
Library Scheme.—One scheme for accrediting Library 
reading, which had been employed by the writer through 
a period of half a dozen years, is here suggested. It 
accredits for merit of reading and for amount of reading. 
Under this plan the child selects any book from an 
accepted list submitted to the pupils by the teacher. 
These books may be supplied from the ‘school and the 
city libraries, and kept in some appropriate place in the 
schoolroom. The pupil, having read the book, reports 
on it to the teacher. To economize time the teacher may 
ask for reports on specific points, to satisfy herself that 
the book was intelligently read from cover to cover. She 
should always encourage the pupils to select some best 
passages which they will read to the class. Reading to 
the class will give a real audience and the pupil con- 
tributes something unfamiliar to the rest of the class, 
* thus motivating reading. The pupil may select to read 
a passage representing dramatization, humor, picture 
conveyed, excellent English, or other type of interest. 
The teacher should assure herself that such passage will 
be well read by assigning this chosen material, with its 
setting, as a reading lesson for the child. 
How much credit should a pupil receive for reading a 
book? According to this scheme the amount of credit is 
based upon merit of the report and the number of pages 
read. Credit is expressed in per cent and is determined 
by using the standard explained on page 236. 
Per cents will be added to final standings in reading, 
history, geography, citizenship, or other subjects for     
  
-P-A-G-E-254
     
    236 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
which the report is made, and such per cents will be 
determined as follows: 
Grades 2,3,4 5,6 Jr. H.8. 
Per Cent Pages Pages Pages 
To To 100 To 125 
se. 76-125 101-150 126-175 
... Above 125 151-200 176-250 
Dy cick sce sols Above 201 Above 250 
  No credit is given to any student for one and the same 
book a second time. 
If the report on any book has quality as follows, then 
multiply thus: 
Quality pane 94-100%) by 12 
« 86-93%) “ 10 “ at “ 78-85%) “ & 
g Dae 4# 70-77%) “ 6 
How to use the above: In grade 5 a pupil reads a 125- 
page book with a B quality of report, hence, the per cent 
mark is: 
1.0 X 15% or 15% 
A seventh grade pupil reads a 180 page book, giving 
a report worth C. What per cent is he entitled to? 
8 X 1.75% or 1.4%. 
Under this plan the per cent earned is added to the 
regular examination grade in reading. It may be added 
to the final grade, if so desired. If a geographical reader 
is the subject of the report, the credit is added to the 
geography grade; if a book on historical fiction, the 
credit is added to the history grade; if on citizenship, the 
credit is added to the citizenship grade; and so on. 
Library lists of suitable books for children’s reading, 
are not difficult to obtain. In the above experiment,
-P-A-G-E-255
READING 237 
books were selected from a list made by the State 
Librarian of the Department of Education. The list is 
known as the Young People’s Reading Circle Books. 
(31) Another excellent list appears in a study made to 
determine which library and supplementary books are 
most used by schools in the elementary grades. (20) 
Librarians also have lists from which choice may be 
made. 
Gullfoile’s Scheme.—Another scheme for encouraging 
library reading excellent in character is one used in an 
elementary school by a teacher who set out to improve 
the reading ability of her class after tests disclosed the 
weakness of her pupils. (14) The scheme is briefly 
reproduced. 
1. A committee of the class and the teacher selected 
the library books. 
2. Sixty volumes were kept in the room at one time. 
3. For recitation purposes the class was divided into 
two groups, one consisting of the poor readers who gen- 
erally read aloud, and the other of better readers, who 
read silently from any book of their choice. A part of 
the plan is given verbatim. 
“The forty-five minute period in which each class 
worked with the teacher, was divided into two parts. 
The group spent fifteen minutes in the preparation of 
stories to be read aloud. Each child made his own selec- 
tion and, the responsibility for that story lay with him. 
During the fifteen minutes study period, he must ask 
all necessary questions, make sure of his pronunciation 
and get the thought of his story. 
“The selection must be a short story, a poem, a play, 
or a chapter from a book. It had to be short (limited 
to 5 minutes when read aloud), new, (nothing from the 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  
  238 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
text book, or any book previously studied by the class), 
interesting (if the class did not enjoy it they told the 
reader so before he got far), and perfectly prepared (the 
pupil might read what he liked during the silent reading 
time but when reading aloud to the class he had to use 
material that was not too hard for him). 
“After fifteen minutes of preparation—each child at 
work on his own story, the teacher giving such attention 
as was required, the children closed their books. The 
teacher chose one pupil after another to read his story 
aloud to the group. Each one had to qualify as a good 
listener before he was permitted to read aloud; but as 
the children grew in power to read a story enjoyably, the 
interest became spontaneous. In the larger group pro- 
vision was made for each child to read at least once a 
week. In the smaller group each one read at least twice 
a week.” 
It is clear that the two schemes for using library books 
in the classroom, may be combined and adapted to local 
needs. 
(c) Group Teaching. On the whole, extensive read- 
ing, encouraged through the use of supplementary and 
library books, papers and magazines, does not meet 
squarely, enough of the reading difficulties of a class, 
which fact is disclosed by the use of educational tests, 
hence, further corrective recommendations are needed. 
The pupils’ abilities in the third grade reading here under 
diagnosis need be subjected to further interpretation. 
Graph XXX reveals four divisions of pupils with 
strengths and weaknesses as previously outlined. 
Group I. Division I, constituting Group I, include 
pupils ahead of their grade in rate and comprehension. 
All of these should do the required daily work. They
-P-A-G-E-257
   READING 239 
should prepare a maximum of special assignments on 
their library and supplementary reading, according to 
the plans above discussed. The reading time of this 
group might be profitably employed in extra work upon 
other school subjects which they find difficult. Some 
members of the group, such as Irma, Lela, Mary, Charles, 
are fit candidates for promotion to grade IV in reading. 
The reading standard for grade IV is 7.2 in comprehen- 
sion and 121 in rate. Each pupil should merit such pro- 
motion contingent to several conditions. First, in being 
advanced, the pupil should “skip” no required work in the 
third or fourth grades. This work can be made up by the 
child under the teacher’s direction, whether it be re- 
quired text book readings, memory work, and so on. 
Another important consideration is that the child’s 
health warrants the physical strain of an irregular pro- 
motion. Before promotion the parent and the child 
should consent to the change. Such consent, in the 
writer’s experience, has never been found to stand in the 
way of a promotion. 
While all needed preparation, incident to an irregular 
promotion, may be left in the teacher’s hands, a most 
logical place in larger school systems in which to do such 
work, is the opportunity room. An opportunity room is 
not Yor backward children only, as is so often supposed. 
It is ‘an intermediary which offers opportunity to all 
deserving of special help, be that help to those who are 
backward or who forge ahead of their grade. Democratic 
education is duty bound to offer opportunities to all who 
are needy of help. Brain conservation and encourage- 
ment of the promising who have wealthy mental re- 
sources is as good an educational policy as one which 
purports to cultivate intensively where wealth is absent. 
      
  
-P-A-G-E-258
     
   240 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
Equal opportunity means opportunity to the strong as 
well as to the weak. From the standpoint of finance 
the returns from cultivating brain wealth should no 
longer be neglected. The opportunity room, often called 
an “ungraded room” should never be labelled the room 
for backward children; it is, as the name implies, a class 
room for all to progress as fast as a flexible system will 
permit them to advance. It seems needless to say that 
only most superior teachers are competent to take charge 
of such a room. 
Group II. Below standard in comprehension. The 
pupils in Divisions II and III are below standard in 
comprehension in reading. On certain days of the week, 
these divisions, including six pupils, Ramona, Nora, 
Ralph, Mae, Orie, and Carol, should be subjected to 
teaching that employs methods which especially stress 
understanding of passages read. For improving the com- 
prehension of pupils in grades II to IV and to some 
extent in grade V, largely the same types of drill and 
special methods will be found useful. A number of 
principles of method (12) with illustrations and explana- 
tions of same are here reproduced. Their observance in 
the classroom should assist in raising the comprehension 
abilities of the six pupils named above. 
1. Difficult reading material is not conducive to good 
comprehension, hence, well chosen reading, just hard 
enough or a little below that of third grade ability, should 
be used. For a third grade class the latter half of well 
graded second readers and the first third of third grade 
readers should contain suitable material. 
2. The child should know that the content of the 
reading lesson will be reproduced. This will lead him to 
seek out the pertinent facts of the lessons. An assign-    
-P-A-G-E-259
  READING 241 
ment invoking reproduction of content should be made. 
The teacher should not say, “You will be expected to 
tell the story of what you study.” Such assignment is no 
challenge to effort. Here are submitted a few assign- 
ments the preparation of which requires study for content. 
Assignment 1. “Write out and bring to class five (or 
some other number of) good questions on the lesson.” 
Assignment 2. “In ten sentences (or any suitable num- 
ber) write, briefly, the story of the lesson.” 
Assignment 3. “Make a drawing of the picture in this 
story.” 
Assignment 4. “What persons are mentioned in the 
story? Which do you like best? Why?” 
Assignment 5. “Change the story of the lesson to nar- 
rative form.” 
The teacher will need to explain and illustrate what 
she expects the pupils to do. 
8. Ability to make judgments concerning what is read 
is essential to comprehension. Group III should find 
answers to given thought provoking questions on the 
lesson. Many reading books include such questions in 
the teacher’s helps, but the teacher will often need to 
supplement them. Summaries of lessons are thought 
provoking, so these should be required. A good question 
can be made by one who understands, so pupils should 
be required to bring to class a few questions of their 
making, on the subject matter in the lesson. In addition 
to the contribution under 2 above, further judgment 
evoking questions may be assigned. “How would you 
make the story end?” “Why not make Jack a big, 
rather than a little boy?” “Would you make a South 
Dakota prairie the scene of this story? Why?” Such  
-P-A-G-E-260
  242 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
questions should be devised by the teacher and required 
as a part of the assignment. 
4, Elements on which meaning depends should be em= 
phasized. This may be promoted through use of topic 
sentences. In lower grades the requirement may be made 
by asking for one sentence which tells briefly all that a 
certain paragraph tells at length. 
Pupils should be required to read chosen sentences 
with a specific expression. To illustrate, the child reads, 
“The apple fell to the ground.” The teacher says, “The 
ball fell to the ground.” Child says, “No, the apple fell 
to the ground.” Teacher, “Say the sentence so you tell 
what the apple did?” Child, “The apple fell to the 
ground.” Teacher, “Say it so you tell where it fell.” 
Child, “The apple fell to the ground.” 
The children should be encouraged to select especially 
interesting passages of the lesson. The chooser should 
read the part he selects. 
5. Rapid readers usually comprehend better than slow 
readers, so, if a class is up to standard in rate, some work 
on speed is desirable, but pupils should not be urged to 
read with a rapidity which destroys effectiveness. When 
it is discovered, urge pupils to read at their marginal 
effective rate. This can be discovered by timing the 
pupil on, say four lines of reading, on successive days, 
taking the average and determining the average per line. 
From these data the time limit of this pupil, for a five, 
ten, or twenty line paragraph, can easily be figured. 
6. Knowing context meaning of words promotes com- 
prehension, therefore, the context meaning of words 
should be required. A mere definition of words is not 
necessary to ascertain what the child knows about con- 
text meanings. Explanations of meaning, or illustrations
-P-A-G-E-261
READING 243 
of same, or using words in intelligent sentences, answer 
the purpose. 
7. Dramatization of lessons or of passages read, is 
based on understanding; therefore, lessons which lend 
themselves to such purposes, should be dramatized. 
Also select a story not in narrative form as, “How 
Arthur Was Made King.”? Require an adaptation so 
that dramatization of the story will be possible. Such 
adaptation may be done in class, the teacher acting as 
scribe, and the pupils suggesting the adaptation. 
8. Various methods of motivation have been sug- 
gested (3). The suggestions made by Briggs and Coff- 
man are specific and useful. Judd recommends the use 
of catalogs from business and publishing houses for mo- 
tivating reading. Postal card views of parks, mountains, 
buildings, historical spots, and so on, may be utilized for 
making reading more effective. Reading of advertise- 
ments of local merchants in the local weekly paper will 
motivate class work. Employing simple graphic devices 
previously illustrated, the progress of the class should be 
graphed. Such graphs should be displayed to the view 
of pupils. A simple graph can be explained so the pupils 
know by their position on it how they stand in rate and 
comprehension. For example, say, “Those who are 
closest to the corner near 1 are best in speed of reading 
and in knowing what they read” and so on. Sometimes 
the course of study in a subject lends itself for display 
that children may see what should be accomplished in a 
given grade. All persons working for a purpose dislike 
to be blinded to the goal they seek. If the goal can be

ball yield little interest to the onlookers who are igno- 
rant 6f the purpose of the team in making a touchdown or 
a “run.” Onlookers, ignorant of the goals sought in games, 
make poor rooters. Children root for their work at 
times, by saying, “I hate school.” To make them root 
by helping them see the goal would produce a positive 
type of enthusiasm resulting in such words as, “I like 
school work” or “we have a good teacher.” 
9. Children may be required to reproduce, in action, 
the thoughts in a lesson, paragraph or sentence. Sup- 
pose they read from “Wynken, Blynken and Nod.” 
“Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes, 
And Nod is a little head, 
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies 
Is a wee one’s trundle bed; 
So shut your eyes while mother sings 
Of wonderful sights that be, 
And you shall see the beautiful things 
As you rock on the mighty sea 
Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three, 
Wynken 
Blynken 
And Nod.” (Field) 
The teacher reading line five may say, “Do what it 
says in this story,” and again, “Do what the fishermen 
say here” (reading the last three lines). 
Children may be required to reproduce in drawings, as 
crude as they may be, the picture conveyed by part of a 
lesson, as in, “Why Do Bells of Christmas Ring?” 
: “Once a lovely shining star, 
Seen by shepherds from afar, 
Gently moved until its light 
Made a manger’s cradle bright. 
There a darling baby lay, 
Pillowed soft upon the hay; 
And its mother sung and smiled 
‘This is Christ, the Holy Child’”
-P-A-G-E-263
  READING 245 
Again this sentence from the life of Louisa M. Alcott, 
“Tost! Lost! <A little girl lost,’ cried a man, ringing 
a large bell.” A part of the group may dramatize this 
and others draw on the board or paper the picture con- 
veyed by the sentence. 
Then, too, the teacher may draw what the class sug- 
gests to her from a description in their reading lesson, as 
from a paragraph in “The Daisy” by Hans C. Anderson. 
The paragraph follows: 
“Out in the country, close by the road-side, there was 
a country house. You yourself have certainly seen it. 
In front of it was a little garden of flowers. Close by it, 
by the ditch in the beautiful green grass, grew a little 
daisy. The sun showed warmly and brightly upon the 
splendid garden flower and so it grew from hour to hour.” 
10. Expository reading material may be used for de- 
veloping comprehension. Such reading may consist of 
several kinds of expositions. Directions explaining a new 
game may be written upon the blackboard. These 
should serve as a reading lesson. The group should study 
this until the individual can tell how to play the game. 
The blackboard material may be on construction work; 
such as how to make a new book. The group should be 
required to follow the directions. In this way the 
teacher can test the comprehension of the expository 
reading material. 
11. Vocabulary Studies. Uncomprehending readers 
sometimes have poor vocabularies. Several methods can 
help in vocabulary building and drill. The pupils may 
be required to use correctly, in sentences, the new and 
the important words of the lesson. The vocabulary 
studies may be divided into two or three word-groups, 
and the pupils be asked to make sentences each contain-  
-P-A-G-E-264
  246 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
ing two or more words from a list of new, important 
words in the lesson. To illustrate the last suggestion, 
suppose the pupils read, 
“Tue CHasp” 
“The antlered monarch of the waste 
Sprung from his heathery couch in haste. 
But, ere his fleet career he took, 
The dew drops from his flanks he shook; 
Like crested leader proud and high, 
Tossed his beamed frontlet to the sky; 
A moment snuffed the tainted gale, 
A moment listened to the cry, 
That thickened as the chase drew nigh.” (Scott) 
The teacher directs the class to make sentences each 
of which contains two of the words in this list. 
antlered leader 
waste dale 
couch moment 
flanks fleet 
Another variation of emphasizing vocabulary study is 
possible through exercises which require pupils to make 
lists of words suggested by other words, such as street- 
car, circus, band, flag, lake, prairie, hotel, farm, ranch, 
and so on. : 
Also, pupils may be asked to make lists of words used 
mostly by persons engaged in certain trades or occupa- 
tions. Thus, the pupil should make lists of words used 
by a blacksmith, a mother, a farmer, a janitor, an 
engineer, and others. 
12. Arithmetic, history, geography and other subjects 
contain material which may be used in the reading class 
for purposes of thought getting. Problems in arithmetic 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
  READING 247 
are particularly good for this purpose, but no attempt 
should be made to solve them. 
13. A few remedial exercises for low comprehension 
are here reproduced, verbatim. (29) ? 
(a) “Expose a paragraph of reasonable difficulty on 
the board for a few seconds. Have the pupils read 
silently and then have them answer questions revealing 
their comprehension of the content of the paragraph. 
(b) “Expose another paragraph, one of directions, on 
the blackboard for a few seconds and permit the children 
to follow them out as soon as they get the thought. 
(c) “Expose a word picture, briefly, and permit the 
children to draw what they get from the brief exposure. 
Emphasize the time factor in order to show children the 
relative rates of reading. 
(d) “Let a child begin to read at any point in the 
story. The child who discovers the place first will con- 
tinue the reading. 
(e) “Questions and directions on the board will lead 
to a study of thoughtful interpretation. For example. 
‘In which speech is John angry?’ ‘Is he slightly vexed 
or very angry?’ ‘Show by your reading what you think 
he is.’” 
14. Monotones. Monotones should read many plays 
and dialogues. In such reading they should omit the 
names of the characters and indicate the same by a 
change in the voice of the speaker. Dramatization par- 
taken in by monotonous readers, will lead to effective 
understanding and expression. Of course, not all mono- 
tones are low in comprehension. 
Group IIT, composed of pupils in Division III and IV, 
is below standard in rate of reading. Some suitable

248 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
methods very useful in stressing speed are here sub- 
mitted. No attempt is made to give these in the order 
of their importance. It is desirable to have ample 
variety of devices all useful in correcting one special type 
of reading weakness. 
1. In the first place stimulate speed through a liberal 
inducement to use supplementary readers and library 
books. This was discussed earlier in the chapter. 
2. The eyes of the reader should take in a large unit 
at a fixation. Slow reading invariably results, in part, 
from small fixation units. Large fixation units should 
be encouraged in slow readers. To illustrate, the chil- 
dren are studying the first part of the “Cradle Song.” 
Crapia Sona 
“The twinkling stars, that stud the skies 
Throughout the quiet night, 
Are only precious little eyes 
Of babies fair and bright; 
For when the babies are asleep, 
An angel comes and takes 
Their little eyes to guard and keep 
Until the morning breaks.” 
To promote speed on this passage there may be flash 
eard or blackboard work on phrases and passages in the 
poem. The passages may consist of “the twinkling 
stars,” “throughout the quiet night,” “when babies are 
asleep,” “an angel comes,” “and takes their little eyes.” 
From subsequent parts of this poem are usable such 
passages as “those little eyes divine,” “We know you,” 
“an angel hovers near,” “sweet nature’s hushaby.” 
In the above illustration, only parts of the poem 
were suggested for flash card drill. An entire paragraph 
may be subjected to flash card drills. Take the following 
from “Old Mother West Wind.”
-P-A-G-E-267
   READING 249 
(“When she reached) (the Green Meadows) (Old 
Mother West Wind) (opened her bag,) (turned it upside 
down) (and shook it.) (Out tumbled) (all the Merry 
Little Breezes) (and began to spin) (round and round) 
(for very joy,) (for you see) (they were to play) (in the 
Green Meadows) (all day long) (until Old Mother West 
Wind) (should come back at night) (and take them all) 
(to their home behind the Purple Hills.”) 
A flash card should be made for passages, each paren- 
thetical group denoting words which may constitute a 
card. Occasional drill of this character will increase 
the eye-span with consequent faster reading. 
A passage may be selected by the teacher, from the 
reading lesson, written upon the blackboard so each line 
constitutes a passage, and the children be required to 
read it with expression and speed. Part of the para- 
graph from “Old Mother West Wind” so reproduced on 
the blackboard would appear as given below: 
“When she reached 
the Green Meadows 
Old Mother West Wind 
opened her bag, 
turned it upside down 
and shook it. 
Out tumbled 
all the Merry Little Breezes 
and began to spin 
round and round 
for very joy, 
for you see 
they were to play,” 
(and so on). 
Ultimately, the children, having gained the idea of 
phrasing, might be assigned phrasing a paragraph in 
their lesson, and then be required to read it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
250 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
8. Easy reading material facilitates rate, hence, diffi- 
cult reading books should be avoided. A third grade 
may profitably read from the last third of second readers. 
When the class has access to supplementary books, have 
them read the first half of one third reader and of 
another, and so on, until all available third readers are 
used, then use the books over again beginning with 
stories in the last two thirds of the readers. 
4. Choose interesting reading material. Most readers 
are replete in interesting reading matter, but what is 
interesting to one child is not necessarily so to another, 
hence the children’s special interests should not be 
overlooked. One child loves a cradle song; another, 
biography; a third, bear stories; others still prefer 
descriptive material from catalogues about toy machines, 
electrical apparatus, games and so on. According to 
individual interests, passages from Popular Mechanics, 
Sunday school papers, newspaper clippings, will make 
acceptable assignments. Incidentally, spontaneously 
chosen reading by children will place the teacher in a 
position of advisory censorship. 
5. Use numerous readers. This is analogous to point 
1 above, but needs special mention. With several 
readers at hand the first part of each book, say a third, 
should be read, to be followed by the first third of a 
second book, and so on until all readers have been read 
in part. After reading the first part of the last text begin 
reading the second third portion of the first book, then of 
the second book, etce., until the second third of all the 
texts have been read. This done finish the last part of 
each book. 
6. Rate is increased by decreasing lip movement. 
Pupils should be taught not to move their lips when
-P-A-G-E-269
  READING 251 
reading. The teacher may say, “Read this part of the 
lesson and keep the lips shut tight.” 
7. Rapid reading increases with increasing visual per- 
ception of words, hence the teacher should drill on word 
recognition. Flash cards should be used for this purpose. 
The teacher can make the flash cards. Cards may vary 
in size, but 3” x 5” cards are about right. The back of 
the cards should contain the words in small script, writ- 
ten in the upper right hand corner. The teacher can 
then tell, without turning the card, what the child sees 
on the face of it. 
8. “Skimming” increases rate but may markedly de- 
crease comprehension. “Skimming” and intelligent rapid 
reading are distinct from one another; the former must 
be discouraged. 
9. Silent reading exercises, executed under prescribed 
time limits, eliminate slow reading; therefore, drill pupils 
to read selections in a prescribed, reasonable time limit 
set by the teacher. She may say, “When you finish, 
raise your hand”; or, “Who can read most lines in one 
minute?” The number of lines read by each child 
should be counted and briefly commented upon. The 
pupils may be encouraged to race, the end of the para- 
graph constituting the goal. i 
10. Work in rate should be motivated through graphs. 
Motivating graphs have been suggested in this and other 
chapters. The following graph on page 252 pictures the 
goal and distance the child has advanced toward it. With 
a little explanation the meaning of it can be made clear.

Because the Monroe Revised Tests in Reading are 
used in grades III and above, it is impossible to deter- 
mine, on the basis of Monroe Standards, how the three 
pupils, above mentioned, compare with second grade 
pupils. There is a possible comparison of these pupils 
with the Gray Oral Reading Standards. These are sub- 
mitted, together with the average scores of the three 
pupils.

3. Carol 46    Clearly, then, Orie and Mae, third graders, are far 
below Gray’s Oral Reading Standard for grade I, and 
they commit many errors in silent as in oral reading. 
Carol exceeds the third grade oral reading standard, and 
corrective work should bring her up to the average of 
her grade. What can be done with Orie and Mae is 
problematical. 
(a) Remedial Work. By noting the predominating 
errors of each child, proper remedies can be surmised. 
Orie: Errors—insertions, substitutions, and omissions. 
One corrective is slow reading, but she is already slow, so 
easy subject matter should be used, even to the extent 
of ultimate demotion to grade II in reading, if she does 
not improve. Also drill on words, phrases, and rhetori- 
cal units will correct, in some measure, the errors. Such 
drills have been discussed previously in this chapter 
(pages 248 and 249). When possible, drills should be 
motivated through games. Some games for developing
-P-A-G-E-273

“comprehension from which Orie should profit are given 
fully in an excellent article by Hoover (15) on motivated 
drill in silent reading. He suggests the use of “Action 
Cards” which are primarily simple commands or requests 
to be performed by the child. Set B consists of “Lan- 
guage Response Cards” response to which is made 
through the medium of spoken or written words. Set C 
consists of “Pretense Cards” which require the child to 
pretend that he is doing some particular thing. Set D 
is a group of “One Word Response Cards”; responses are 
made by using any of following words: Yes, No, Right, 
Wrong. 
The contents of a few cards of each set are here re-

overcome halting require her to read, without pauses, 
short, complete sentences. It should be noted that she 
seems to have no special trouble in pronunciation. Also 
drill on words, phrases, and rhetorical units, will help to 
correct her errors. The insertions were not of such char- 
acter as to necessitate especial correction and may disap- 
pear after halting and repeating are overcome. She seems 
to have a poor reading foundation. This should be gradu- 
ally strengthened. Mae and Orie seem to be fit candi- 
dates for the opportunity room. Mae and Orie are 
graded high and could work better in grade II, but Mae

    258 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
A number of pupils in Division III who are very deficient 
in rate and comprehension constitute a special group, 
each member of which should be the recipient of very 
special, individual, remedial treatment. 
Remedial measures for Section 3B are like those sug- 
gested for Groups I, II, III in Section A. (See preceding 
pages. ) 
(a) Special Group. Virtually, Elroy in Division I, 
constitutes a special group in that he possesses excep- 
tional reading ability, which should be recognized by 
promotion. 
For a more complete diagnosis of the weakest pupils 
in Division III, the Gray’s Oral Reading Paragraphs 
were administered to Ed, Myrtie, Lee, John and Dorothy. 
The results of this test are given below. 
The average individual scores of these children and 
the third grade standard are as follows:

teacher. Correctives: Easy reading; call attention to 
errors using individual card plan suggested later; give 
varied drill on mispronounced words and on those sub- 
stituted. 
The nature of the troublesome words suggests that 
Dorothy’s perception is “slip-shod.” Identity of sound 
or form brings immediate reaction, but of the wrong sort. 
Clearer visual perception will eliminate some of her 
trouble. In giving Dorothy word drills the teacher 
should frequently ask, “Is the picture of the word very 
clear before you pronounce it?” Only after such clarity 
is ascertained may the word be pronounced. 
John—Substitution. From an examination of his 
paper we note that the trouble arises from poor English, 
reading what he pictures in imagination rather than the 
exact words on the page, and possible carelessness. 
These bad habits in his reading should be broken by 
attending to each individual fault. 
Lee—Mispronunciation and substitution. For correc- 
tive see above. 
Myrtie—Mispronunciation of the types correctable 
through more phonic drill. 
Ed—Substitutes—boy (dog), pen (pig), so (she), 
pig (dog), same (small), puss (pussy), till (tail). 
An interesting type of substitution in which the form 
of word, a letter in it, or sound of the initial part, sug- 
gests some word more or less like the image. Word drills 
on the image and the substituted word will correct this 
evil. The pupil seems classified above his virtual grade. 
The teacher of this grade offers the following cor- 
rectives: 
“Five to ten minutes of daily individual training in 
oral reading of easy nature. Keep record of individual

The accomplishment of this class can be represented 
in graphic form after the style of Graph XXXI. On the 
basis of such representation, however, not here repro- 
duced, the pupils in the class were assigned to Groups 
I, II, and IJI and a special group consisting of several 
very poor readers and one other child, Edith, who is very 
superior in reading. 
Remedial Measures—Many of these are so similar in 
principle to those previously discussed that they warrant 
brevity in discussion. 
(a) Library reading should be utilized with such pupils 
as are in need of corrective help. Schemes for using 
a library have been discussed on previous pages. They 
may be adapted for upper grade work. 
(b) Group I. Except Edith, Irene, and Orin the pupils 
of Division I, while above standard, are not eligible to 
consideration for speedy promotion. They should not be 
held back by the class in their reading. Extensive read- 
ing privileges may be accorded them. Library books, 
magazines, choice literature suited to their abilities 
should engage some of their reading time. 
(ce) Group II, composed of Divisions II and III, both 
weak in comprehension, includes two thirds of the pupils 
in this class. 
Remedial Teaching—Some corrective methods helpful 
in improving comprehension are here submitted. They 
are adapted from similar exercises suggested for use 
with the upper primary and the lower intermediate 
grades. The following adaptations are designed for 
grades V to VIII, inclusive. 
1. Difficult reading material is destructive to produc- 
tion of understanding, hence, reading material should 
be well chosen. Text books are usually well graded but 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  262 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
difficult supplementary reading may be erroneously 
recommended for class use. 
2. The children should know that the content of the 
reading lesson will be reproduced. This will lead them 
to seek out the pertinent facts of the lesson. For a fuller 
discussion of this principle see 2, page 241. 
8. Ability to make judgments concerning content of 
lesson is essential to comprehension. Read again 8, 
page 241. Attempt to assign “problem” as well as mere 
fact questions. To illustrate “problem” assignment ques- 
tions, consider the selection, “The Star-Spangled Ban- 
ner.”1 The selection begins with an excellent setting, 
giving pupils the circumstances which Key experienced 
before being inspired to create his lasting production. 
The poem follows this explanation. Having studied the 
selection have pupils discuss problems, such as: 
Problem 1: The United States recently emerged from 
the Great War in which Canada was one of our allies. 
The countries now are staunch friends. The “Star- 
Spangled Banner” is our national anthem. Does the 
song include war-like passages? If so, which ones? 
Should or should not the song be treated as history 
rather than as an expression of patriotism? 
Problem 2: Had you been in Key’s place of tem- 
porary confinement on board an enemy warship, and had 
witnessed as he did, the night battle, which of his senti- 
ments would you have included in the song; which would 
you now omit; which new ones would you add? 
4, Elements on which meaning depends should be 
emphasized. This may be promoted through the use of 
topic sentences, also of outlines. Require pupils to select 
especially interesting passages, interesting for choice of 
*Searson and Martin, Studies in Reading, Book 8. Pages 19-24. 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
   READING 263 
words, beautiful English expression, beautiful thought, 
humor or other sentiment. Require him to read this 
selection to the class. Such material may be chosen 
from the Current Events, a daily paper, a juvenile maga- 
zine, a catalogue, a circular or pamphlet advertising or 
describing scenery along railroad or ocean routes, library 
books, and other varied sources. Always bear in mind 
that in strengthening comprehension we work for com- 
prehension and not for the perusal of literature which has 
stood the test of severe literary critics. The pupil in 
reading to the class such passage of his choice has a real 
audience. He may be required to explain briefly the 
reason for his choice. 
Meaning is clarified through pertinent historical set- 
ting or properly selected life history of the author, how- 
ever, clarified only in so far as the author’s biography 
bears relevantly upon the studied selection. To illustrate 
“The Old Oaken Bucket” may be used as follows: 
The poem “The Old Oaken Bucket” was written about a real oaken 
bucket. The author of the poem, Samuel Woodworth, spent his boy- 
hood days in the places he describes in the poem. This was in the 
town of Greenbush, Massachusetts. There is now a movement on foot 
by the people of that part of the country to restore “the old oaken 
bucket,” “the mill,” and other things mentioned in the poem, to their 
original form. 
The old mill, dilapidated and leaning in helpless fashion against an 
old ice house, is still in its original position. Its roof only has been 
kept shingled and a sign has been placed on its side indicating that it 
was built in 1640. Inside it is pretty well gone, but in one corner 
is the old stone with which the miller of ancient times used to grind 
corn brought in by farmers. Opposite the mill is the “widespreading 
pond,” a pretty sheet of water from which used to rush the “cataract,” 
that furnished the power for the running of the mill. In ancient days 
only a rude bridge spanned the space between the mill and the pond, 
but modern demands led the state to take a small section from the 
pond and build the state road between these two historic spots. 
In the pond opposite some changes have been made, the “rock where 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  
  264 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
the cataract fell” having been moved to another portion of the pond, 
probably to make the State road more secure against spring freshets. 
“The widespreading pond” is still there unsmirched and in all its ancient 
form, reeds surrounding it and trees and bushes lining it. 
Many tourists and automobile parties search out the old well and 
the mill and the pond, and recall to their minds the touching homesick 
feeling that must have engrossed the boy Woodworth in the big city 
of New York and far removed from the loved scenes of his childhood. 
As he writes in the poem: 
“And now far removed from the loved situation, 
The tear of regret will intrusively swell.” 
“The cot of my father and the dairy house nigh it,” still is in exist- 
ence and is the mecca of many tourists who visit this historic region. 
The house and the well are situated about a quarter of a mile from the 
mill on a side road. Samuel Woodworth was born in this house in 
1785 and spent his boyhood as a farm youth in this district. 
Not far from the old mill, within a stone’s throw, perhaps, is the site 
of the old blockhouse, the scene of the last battle in Massachusetts 
in King Phillip’s war, and across the street from this site stands the 
oldest brick house in Scituate, its walls filled with brick and stone as a 
protection against the bullets of the Indians. 
“The Old Oaken Bucket” is said to have been written in 1817. The 
family were then living in Duane Street, New York City. The poet 
came home to dinner one very hot day, having walked from his office 
in Wall Street. He drank a glass of water from the pump, exclaiming 
as he placed the glass on the table: “This is very refreshing, but how 
much more refreshing would it be to take a good long draught 
this warm day from the old oaken bucket I left hanging in my father’s 
well at home!” His wife at once suggested that he write a poem on the 
subject, and, under the inspiration of the moment, he sat down and 
poured from the depths of his heart the beautiful lines that have im- 
mortalized the name of Samuel Woodworth* 
5. Rapid readers usually comprehend better than slow 
readers. (Reread suggestions, page 242, No. 5.) 
6. Knowing context meaning of words promotes com- 
prehension. In addition to demanding meaning of words 
in the usual way the following procedure is suggested.”

  READING 265 
This drill will test your ability to recognize easily, 
relationship between words. Beginning on the first line 
of your paper, write the figures 1 to 7 below each other. 
Note these seven lines of words. 
1. Tire, rubber (wagon, circle, house, brush, 
bricks). 
2. Tailor, clothes (baker, store, city, ship, 
bread). 
. Fire, heat (knife, candle, burn, light, wood). 
. Sailor, sea (book, sing, soldier, fight, land). 
. Gun, bullet (bow, horse, shoot, arrow, fly). 
. Young, quick (old, fast, grow, father, slow). 
. Apple, tree (oranges, south, grape, vine, 
sweet). 
Look again at line 1. The relationship of words in 
that line reads “Tire is to rubber as house is to bricks.” 
Therefore, on your paper after 1 write “Tire, rubber, 
house, bricks.” 
Look at line 2. The correct relationship here is, 
“Tailor is to clothes as baker is to bread.” Therefore, 
on your paper after 2 write, “Tailor, clothes, baker, 
bread.” 
Write 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 in the same way. 
In addition, comprehension in higher grades necessi- 
tates an understanding of groups of words, such as the 
following selected from “Horatius”: 
NO 
ob 
“the great house of Tarquin” 
“trysting day” 
“summon his array” 
“sent up her tale of men” 
“the rock Tarpeian” 
“Fathers of the City.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  266 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
7. Dramatization promotes comprehension. (Read 7, 
p. 243.) 
The teacher may select a passage lending itself well 
for dramatization but not in form for immediate use as, 
The Sardinian Drummer Boy from “The Heart of a Boy.” 
The captain folded the paper and said Drasquelees 
“Drummer.” 
The drummer put his hand to his visor. 
“Have you courage?” asked the captain. 
The boy’s eyes flashed, “Yes, Signor Cap- 
tain,” he answered. 
“Look down there,” said the captain, pushing 
him to the window. 
Pupils should be required to write the above passage, 
making it suitable for dramatization. Below is one pos- 
sible arrangement which might be expected of the pupil. 
Captain: (Folding paper, looking at boy fixedly) 
“Drummer!” 
Drummer: (Saluting) 
Captain: “Have you courage?” 
Drummer: (With flashing eyes) “Yes, Signor Captain.” 
Captain: (To boy) “Look down there” (pushing boy 
to window). 
8. Motivating methods should be employed by the 
teacher. (Reread carefully 8, page 243.) 
9. Pupils may be required to reproduce in action the 
thoughts in a lesson which they prepare for dramatiza- 
tion. The above passage in No. 7 would serve the pur- 
pose. 
Parts of “Hiawatha” may be prepared for dramatiza- 
tion. This can also be done with “The Siege of Troy” 
(from “Myths of Old Greece’) with the poem by 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
  
READING 267 
Campbell, “Lord Ullin’s Daughter,” and other reading 
selections. 
The children may be asked to reproduce in drawing 
certain words, phrases, and longer passages such as: 
“Somewhat back from the village street 
Stands the old fashioned country seat.” 
or 
“T sprang to the stirrup and Joris and he. 
I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three; 
‘Good speed!’ cried the watch, as the gatebolts he drew; 
‘Speed’ echoed the wall to us galloping thru; 
Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest, 
And into the midnight we galloped abreast.” 
(Browning) 
The teacher draws and the pupils should be asked to 
find passages in the lesson which the drawing illustrates. 
Sometimes a painting may be used in lieu of the drawing. 
The Perry Pictures and others like them may be used. 
(Reread 9, pages 244 and 245.) 
10. Expository reading material may be used for fos- 
tering comprehension. (Read 10, page 245.) For older 
children such material should represent their interests. 
Girls may read directions on how to make a button-hole, 
to make fudge, to wash dishes, to make gravy, to knit, 
and so on; boys, how to connect two dry cells, to plane 
end of a board, to raise the flag at half-mast, to make a 
fly trap, and so on. There are some expositions interest- 
ing to boys and girls, as to “open” a new book, to collect 
compositions, to salute the American flag, to observe a 
flag raising, etc. The group, when practicable, should 
follow the directions to give proof of understanding. 
11. Vocabulary studies. (Read 11, page 245.) 
12. Teach pupils to grasp the thought of passages in 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
  268 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
hygiene, geography, history, arithmetic and other sub- 
jects. Inability to do this is sometimes responsible for 
poor scholarship even though the pupil appears to read 
well from the reading text book. 
Group III, composed of Divisions III and IV, is slow 
in rate of reading. 
Remedial teaching of this group follows the same 
general lines employed in discussing a similar group 
under grade III. However, the principles of method 
must be adapted for older pupils. 
1. Stimulate speed through use of library books and 
supplementary readers. 
2. Develop in pupils ability to grasp large fixation 
units. Flash cards are not as practicable in upper as in 
lower grades for large unit fixation, but the blackboard 
can be used. The group may be required to write, occa- 
sionally, a portion of the lesson, enclosing in parentheses 
such groups of words as to them constitute natural fixa- 
tions. They should then read what the parentheses 
indicate. The following is an illustration. 
Concorp Hymn 
(By the rude bridge) (that arched the flood) 
(Their flag to April’s breeze unfurled,) 
(Here once the embattled farmers stood,) 
(And fired the shot) (heard round the world). 
Prose lends itself to similar treatment. Two possible 
groupings are given for the same passage. 
Grouping one: 
“(The Indians) (of our ‘American Sahara’) an com- 
pelled) (by circumstances) (to overcome conditions) 
(not encountered) (by their brothers) (of the plains) 
(and mountains).” 
Grouping two:
-P-A-G-E-287
  READING 269 
“(The Indians of our ‘American Sahara’) (are com- 
pelled by circumstances) (to overcome conditions) (not 
encountered) (by their brothers of the plains and moun- 
tains).” 
3. Select easy reading material in working for speed. 
4, Choose interesting material. What interests one 
child will not interest another. Indian stories, selections 
about dogs, motors, how to make things with tools, etc., 
will interest boys. On the whole girls will find more 
interest in selections about flowers, quiet scenery, etc. 
Certainly there is much reading material of common in- 
terest to both boys and girls. 
5. Use numerous readers and supplementary material. 
6. If any lip movement is used, eradicate it. 
7. Silent reading for speed should be encouraged. 
(See pages 241, 244.) 
8. Motivation of speedy silent reading should be 
attempted by the teacher. (See 10, page 245.) 
(d) Special group. Very superior and very inferior 
pupils in reading belong with this group. 
The very superior pupils are entitled to serious con- 
sideration. It is fair to presume that out of their number 
will be developed many leaders of national life. Since 
education presumes to develop leaders, this group should 
constitute fertile soil in which to work, a soil not to be 
neglected or passed by with the foolish statement, “The 
bright children, because of their very ability, will look 
after themselves,” but a teacher who permits them to do 
so is either ignorant of the issue which she faces or is 
willfully negligent of a great duty. On the basis of 
comparing the right of one child with that of another, 
the very bright pupil is entitled to at least as much time, 
thought and planning as is the very dull child! 
   
-P-A-G-E-288
  270 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
Edith possesses reading ability at least one grade in 
advance of her own. A part of her reading period could 
be more profitably employed in some other subject. 
Better still, she might be promoted in reading into the 
grade next above. Promotion by subjects in the upper 
elementary grades and the junior high school is no differ- 
ent in principle from promotion by subject in a high 
school organized on the 8-4 plan. The remaining pupils 
of this group, who are located in Division I, are strong 
in rate of reading but only a trifle above standard in 
comprehension. With some special help, at least Orin 
and Irene, and possibly Reo might hope for promotion 
in reading ahead of the class. Principles controlling 
promotion of pupils irregularly are the same for all 
grades. 
Very inferior pupils in Division III need more assist- 
ance than that accorded to them in Groups II and III. 
Their efforts need further diagnosis for the purpose of 
discovering the errors which make them the poorest 
readers in the group. Such a diagnosis is recommended 
through the use of the Gray Oral Reading Paragraphs. 
Only a few of the very poor readers of the special 
group are here reported, a sufficient number to illustrate 
the procedure.

2. May 49 
3. Alvin 49

Roy—Up to the difficult passages he exhibits no errors.

fied.

sensitive to criticism. Judicious praise and encourage- 
ment to beget confidence will help. Should do much 
easy reading. 
Alger—A careless reader. He says “once” for one, “in 
the bird-room” for “in my bird-room,” “every” for “ever.” 
In oral reading the teacher should hold him for exactly 
each word with the hope that habits of exactness will 
transfer to silent reading and help his comprehension. 
Question: Will diagnosis and remedial teaching im- 
prove quality of reading? The presumption of this 
entire chapter and of the entire volume is in the affirma- 
tive to the question. Experimental evidence supports 
the presumption. 
(a) Dr. Gray (11) reports a study of individual diffi- 
culties in silent reading in the fourth, fifth, and sixth 
grades. He reports in such study the case of a fourth 
grade pupil who very materially profited through diag- 
nostic testing and remedial teaching. In his study he 
reports the progress of a fifth grade pupil who was 
subjected to diagnostic testing and remedial teaching. 
The amount of progress is reported below:

trol experiment with approximately 1200 public school 
pupils in 40 classes and 18 elementary schools in 9 cities

so subjected, as recorded below.

DIAGNOSIS IN ARITHMETIC 
Questions 
1. How would you do group teaching in arithmetic? 
2. In teaching long division, on what basis would you make class 
groups? 
3. Diagnosis of arithmetical abilities discloses not only group but 
individual weaknesses. Is it practicable to give individual help in 
arithmetic during the regular class period? 
4. How can arithmetic tests show group and individual weaknesses? 
5. What are some outstanding errors committed by pupils in solving 
exercises in the fundamental operations? 
6. Real diagnosis consists in ascertaining the psychological process 
underlying the errors in the solution of problems. Apply this to the 
problem and its answer as here submitted. z

One of the most important tool subjects in the elemen- 
tary school is arithmetic. Much study was given this 
subject and for it were developed the first educational 
tests used. Of these first tests none have come into 
such prominence as the Courtis Tests. These are still 
extensively used. Later, arithmetic tests of a diagnostic 
character were devised. We shall study some of the 
diagnostic tests in arithmetic.

paper, with ample space for the insertion of answers. 
In each series the scales are on the fundamental opera- 
tions. A distinctive feature of these scales is that all 
types of problems are included in each of the operations. 
Thus, the Addition Scale contains exercises on single 
digit, two digit, and three digit columns; exercises on 
addition of mixed numbers, fractions, and so on. The 
exercises in this scale are in accord with daily practice 
in arithmetical computations. They cover all phases of 
addition taught in most progressive courses in elementary 
arithmetic. The exercises in this operation cover work 
which is, with a few exceptions, true to the demands of 
daily life. The scales in the other three operations con- 
tain exercises in accord with daily practices in the use of 
arithmetic; they cover all phases of the operations taught 
in progressive arithmetic courses of study. The scales 
in Series B contain some of the exercises of Series A, 
so chosen as to represent nearly equal steps in difficulty 
from one exercise to the next succeeding one. Each exer- 
cise in Series B retains the same number as it has in the 
Series A Scale. However, the second series has approxi- 
mately one-half the number of problems as the first, so 
only 10 minutes are allowed in giving Series B Scales.

280 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
General Directions——The same general directions, with 
adaptations to arithmetic work, are followed in giving 
the Woody Arithmetic Scales as were prescribed for 
observance in reading. 
Specific Directions—The same test is given to all chil- 
dren in the different grades and to all the children in 
one class or room at the same time. This scale can be 
easily given to all the pupils in a rural school at the 
same time. Woody recommends that the scales be used 
as follows: 
Grades 2-8 in addition and subtraction, and 
Grades 3-8 in multiplication and division. 
The scales may or may not be given in immediate 
succession, depending upon the amount of time at the 
teacher’s disposal. Further directions follow: 
. “Clear the desks, provide each pupil with a sharpened pencil, and 
a ‘One of these sheets will be laid on your desk face down. Leave 
it oe until I tell you to turn ite 
. “Have the pupils in the front seats distribute the tests. Then 
ot ‘Get your pencils. Turn the sheet and answer the question on 
top.’ (The number of questions to be answered can be determined by 
the one giving the tests. It will take less time and cause less con- 
fusion if the one giving the tests will repeat the question and tell the 
children what to write. For example, say, “The first line asks, “What 
is your name? Write your name,”’ etc.)” 
3. “When all desired information has been secured, then say, with- 
out specially stressing any portion thereof, ‘Every problem on the 
sheet which I have given you is an addition problem, an “and prob- 
lem.” Work as many of these problems as you can and be sure that 
you get them right. Do all of your work on this sheet of paper and 
don’t ask anybody any questions. Begin.’” 
4. “For each scale in Series B, allow ten minutes. See that all 
children quit work when the signal ‘Stop’ is given. Most of the 
children will have finished before that time. Those who have not, in 
all probability have done all they can; at least they have taken as 
much time as it takes the average class to complete the test.”
-P-A-G-E-299
ARITHMETIC 281 
The only variation of procedure in giving any of the 
other tests is the substitution in the formula of specific 
directions of the expressions “subtraction or take away 
problems,” “multiplication or ‘times problems,’” and 
“division or ‘into problems’ ” for the expression “addition 
or ‘and problems.’ ” 
How to Score the Tests—‘In scoring the tests the 
standard for marking a problem correctly is absolute 
accuracy, and, wherever possible, reduction to its lowest 
terms, .. . only those answers should be accepted as 
correct which are found in Table LXIII.” “A few incor- 
rect answers are also listed in order to offer less chance 
for variation in the scoring of results.” 
The tests having been given the papers are marked, 
using the answers as printed in Table LXIII for checking 
purposes. The results of each pupil are then recorded on a 
score sheet as in Table LXV. It is not necessary in using 
Series B to determine the per cent of pupils getting each 
problem. 
How to Determine the Class Score—There are two 
methods for determining the class score. The first one 
suggested by Woody is intended for use especially with 
Series A tests. This method (22), while more accurate 
than the one here described, is rather involved for 
elementary uses and for that reason Series A scales are 
omitted from this study. 
The second method was devised especially for Series B. 
By this method the median number of problems solved 
correctly is taken as the measure of the achievement of 
any class. 
Upon examining the paper submitted by one of the 
children we make entries on the score sheet showing 
which of the problems that child solved correctly and

which incorrectly. If this pupil solved correctly numbers 
1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 19, 21, 22, 24, then some appropriate 
mark, as C, is placed in the score sheet under the numbers 
of these problems, opposite his name. Since he missed 
numbers 13, 16, 20, 23, 30, 33, 36, 38, then a mark, as O, 
is placed under these numbers opposite his name on the 
score sheet to show in which problems he failed. At the 
right of the score sheet is indicated the number of prob- 
lems solved correctly by this pupil. In a similar way 
the accomplishments of all the pupils are entered on the 
score sheet, and the total for rights is recorded. On this 
score sheet we now have the necessary data for finding 
the median and the general and special weaknesses of 
the class. This datum may be resolved into a problem 
which follows: 
Problem: The score sheet represents that one pupil 
solved correctly 18 exercises; 2 pupils, 17; 3, 16; 2, 15; 
4, 14; 6, 185.6,42;.8, 115-810 +1, 9; 0, 851,.7.) Whae

We make a frequency distribution table and solve for 
the median. 
The next step requires a comparison of the class 
accomplishment with the grade standard. The Woody 
standards in the fundamental operations are submitted 
in Table LXIV.

The addition standard for grade four is 12.3; the 
median 13.5. 
Diagnostic and remedial work will be attempted later; 
however, one point needs to be made here. Woody states 
that in order to prevent variations in results, a few of 
the answers are intentionally incorrect. Upon examining 
the score sheet for the exercises incorrectly solved by 
the class, the teacher should be certain that the exercise 
is really wrong. The only way to ascertain this is by 
working the doubtful exercise. 
Administering Woody Tests in Public Schools—The 
Woody Tests Series B were administered to grade 7B.* 
Directions were strictly followed. Since the pupils are 
sufficiently advanced they were asked to exchange and 
to mark the papers, as the examiner read the answers. 
The correct score was marked in the upper right hand 
corner of each paper. If a median of the number of 
problems solved were desired, and nothing more, then

ber, 1921.

no tabulation of this class would be necessary. However, 
we need to know which problems were easy—which 
difficult. To gather all this information a table is made 
from which pertinent data are obtainable. A part of such 
table for this class of 32 pupils is given for illustrative 
purposes.

The figures at the extreme right stand for number of 
problems solved correctly by each pupil; those at the 
bottom, for the number of times each problem was 
missed. The figures at the right supply the data for 
obtaining the median, which for this class in Addition 
is 16.4. The accomplishments of this 7B class in the 
other fundamental operations were recorded in tables 
like the above and medians were obtained. The class 
medians and standards are:

Since the class medians are so close to the standards, 
the probability is that this class will exceed the medians 
by the close of the school year.

28 Since exercises 22, 24, 30, 36 are hard for 
63 about 30% of the class, drill on these 
95 should extend to such pupils only who find 
169 them difficult. This invites a grouping of 
22 the class for drill in addition, for not the 
33 same pupils find difficulty with each of 
36 these exercises. 1.01 By consulting data in Table LXV pupils 
oe 1, 12, 16, 24, 27, and 32 miss six to eight 
a out of nineteen exercises, similar to types 
’ 22, 23, 24, 30, 33, 36, and 38. These pupils 
AAD constitute another group to which should 
18 be given special drills on these types, ex- 
56 cept type 38. In like manner the other 
difficulties of this class can be determined. 
To illustrate further, in subtraction the 
class finds special trouble with exercises 25, 
27, and 31.
-P-A-G-E-305
ARITHMETIC 287 
(a) Addition. Table LXVI shows that many in the 
class find addition exercises 22, 24,. 30, 33, 36, and 38 
difficult. Exercises 33 and 38 were missed by nineteen 
and twenty-three pupils respectively, so such types may 
profitably be given the class for drill. Exercise 33 is long 
column addition. Exercise 38 typifies an exercise not 
commonly met with in the business world and it is doubt- 
ful that much drill on this type is desirable.

It is not the difficulty but the form of the exercise in 
31 which is troublesome. In the practices of daily life 
this form is so infrequently met with that but little, 
if any, time should be spent on it. Exercise 25 was 
worked incorrectly by seventeen pupils with type errors as

Corrective drill on seeing need of drawing line through 
7 and writing 6 above it, then completing the operation. 
Other types of errors were noted in the pupils’ work, 
but the foregoing serve sufficiently to illustrate the man- 
ner of doing corrective work from data submitted in 
Table LXVI and an examination of the test papers. The 
results obtained from testing the pupils in ability to 
subtract indicate the need of group work in order to 
secure better individual and class results in subtraction. 
Exercise 27 in subtraction consists of work in denom- 
inate numbers. Table LXVI indicates that seventeen 
pupils solved the exercise incorrectly. An examination of 
these incorrect efforts reveals several typical errors com- 
mitted by the children. Corrective work should be based 
upon the type errors noted by the teacher. 
(c) Multiplication. In this operation minor difficulties 
are immediately apparent by consulting the class score 
sheet. Exercises 33, 35, 37, and 38 were incorrectly solved 
by many pupils. Exercise 33, 2144 x 31,—= , when 
incorrectly worked, showed no types of errors. Each 
individual apparently had a special difficulty, as the 
papers disclose. Individual help on this type of problem 
is necessary, after giving this group of fifteen who could 
not work it, general help. The needs of the pupils in 
working the other difficult exercises could be learned 
partly from a study of the answers and the work on 
the test papers. 
Certain pupils had difficulty with a large number of 
the multiplication exercises. These should receive indi- 
vidual help on the troublesome work and might be 
coached, in part, by pupil-teachers who could assist 
under direction of the teacher in charge of the room.
-P-A-G-E-307
  ARITHMETIC 289 
(d) Division. In division we find the need of apply- 
ing the same procedure as above. Short division, finding 
fractional part of a number, division of decimals, division 
of fraction by whole number, division of decimals by 
mixed numbers, and division of denominate numbers 
are the especial difficulties of the class. Five to ten 
minute drills on easy problems, involving one difficulty 
at a time, should precede each day’s work until such 
problems can be solved. 
However, “real diagnosis consists in ascertaining the 
psychological process underlying the errors in the solu- 
tions of the problems.” (22) 1 In effective group and 
individual teaching the underlying processes responsible 
for the errors must be sought for by the teacher. 
Errors inherent in number work assist the teacher in 
diagnosing difficulties. Several studies of such errors 
have been made. 
(a) Gist’s investigation (8) was directed at a study of 
errors committed by children in one of the Seattle 
schools. Gist reduces the frequency of error to a per-

Anderson and his teachers then made a summary of 
the division difficulties of their seventh and eighth 
grade pupils. The summary follows: 
1. The assumption that the first integer of the divisor 
may be used always as a trial divisor. 
2. The trial-and-error method of finding quotient. 
8. Ignorance of multiplication tables. 
4, Carrying wrong number when multiplying. 
5. Borrowing in subtraction.

  292 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
6. Ignorance of value of cipher. 
7. Forgetting to place integers in quotient. 
Information divulged by the above summaries and 
investigations can be adapted for the remedial teaching 
of Grade VIIB, the test results of which are recorded 
on earlier pages. 
Knowing the specific type errors committed by pupils, 
these errors should be psychologically diagnosed. They 
will probably fall under any one of the principles of 
method summarized by Monroe. These principles are a 
summary of scientific investigations (11f) conducted by 
numerous scholars. 
Principles of Method. 
1. “In borrowing, it is better to increase the sub- 
trahend by one than to decrease the minuend.” There 
may be some doubt as to the correctness of this principle 
since the experiment was performed on adults. 
2. “The Austrian, or multiplicative method of division 
is superior to the direct association method in the initial 
stages of learning.” 
In an experimental study Mead and Sears (10) con- 
clude thus: 
“There is not the same possible confusion, then, in 
teaching division by the shortened multiplication process 
as there may be in teaching subtraction by addition.” 
Monroe says, “Teachers should expect the Austrian 
methods to disappear when the pupil is sufficiently 
advanced.” ' 
Briefly then, studies indicate that in the early stages 
of division teaching, the pupil should be expected to solve 
exercises like the following:
-P-A-G-E-311
ARITHMETIC 293 
4 Bee x5 5) 20 5X ?=20, ete. 
In later stages of division teaching this procedure should 
be eliminated. For corrective purposes, however, some 
pupils poor in arithmetic may need just such drills. 
8. “The Austrian method of placing the decimal point 
in the division of decimals is more efficient than the 
traditional method.” 
Traditional method: “There are as many places in 
the quotient as those in the dividend exceed those in the 
divisor.” 
Austrian method: “First render the divisor an integer 
by multiplying both the dividend and the divisor by 10 
or some power of 10. Then proceed as with integral 
divisors.” 
To illustrate the two methods, several exercises rep- 
resenting types of problems in division of decimals are 
given at the left and they are solved in part, by each 
method.

errors by Gist, Theisen, and Anderson is listed on pre- 
ceding pages. 
5. “Pupils should be taught to use an abbreviated 
phraseology.” 
To illustrate, when adding 3, 5, 8, 6, pupils should not 
think, “8 and 5 are 8; 8 and 8 are 16; 16 and 6 are 22”; 
but to think, “3, 8, 16, 22, write 22.” 
396 In subtraction the pupils should not be per- 
—254 mitted to say, “4 from 6 is 2, put down 2; 5 
— from 9 is 4, put down 4; 2 from 8 is 1, put 
down 1.” Economy of time in education requires a 
shorter way, such as, “4 from 6, 2, write 2; 5 from 9, 4, 
write 4; 2 from 3, 1, write 1.” 
The principle of economical phraseology should be 
employed in multiplication and division and in the state- 
ment of steps in arithmetical problems. Such practices 
lead to higher rates and accuracies in the operations of 
arithmetic. 
6. “After the initial stage of practice, drill upon the 
fundamental combinations should be given by means of 
examples.” 
Up to a certain point, then, drill on the tables is in 
order, but when the “law of diminishing returns” in drill 
work begins to operate, then drill on such combinations 
should come as they occur in examples. Monroe draws 
this conclusion from the studies of Courtis, Mead & 
Sears, Browne, and Arnett and from our present concept 
of the doctrine of formal discipline. 
7. “Practice periods should be from 10 to 15 minutes.” 
For practice purposes short, snappy drill periods have 
been the traditional belief. This has been borne out by 
Monroe’s conclusions. Kinkley suggests a much shorter 
period of practice.

9. “In the operations of arithmetic emphasis should 
be placed upon rapid work rather than upon accuracy.” 
This conclusion, reached by Monroe, is substantiated 
by studies made by Thorndike, Tukaya, Wimmer, and 
Monroe himself. Some pupils are exceptions to this 
principle but, on the whole, greater emphasis should be 
placed upon the speed of operations and accuracy will 
come with speed.

10. Group instruction is necessary for meeting group 
needs of children. Group instruction may need to be 
supplemented by individual instruction. 
11. “Arithmetical abilities are specific, and explicit 
training must be provided for each one.” 
Incidentally, this is another proof that the doctrine 
of formal discipline should not be made the basis for 
the choice of methods. To quote comment on 11. 
“Numerous studies have demonstrated that arithmetical 
abilities are specific, ie., that pupils may have, and 
frequently do have ability to do one type of example 
without possessing an equivalent degree of ability to do 
even a closely related type of example. For example,
-P-A-G-E-315
  ARITHMETIC 297 
Beers found that practice in adding columns of 10 digits 
did not materially affect the ability to add columns of 
20 digits. This means that in order properly to equip 
pupils to do all types of examples, drill must be provided 
upon each type.” (The italics are not Monroe’s.) 
12. Diagnostic and remedial instruction are necessary. 
13. Arithmetical study and practice which is motivated 
by “practical” problems produces results superior to those 
secured by using the problems in the textbook. This 
principle points to the value of the “problem” method 
in arithmetic. Some of the newer texts on the market 
are introducing such “problems,” 
Illustrations of “problems”: 
(1) Your mother keeps 50 chickens. During the past year did 
they pay for their upkeep? What was her gain or loss in 
dollars and cents? 
(2) Last year your father sowed 100A. of wheat. Did he make or 
lose on the investment, how much? 
(3) Jones deposits $8000 in a bank at 4 per cent interest. Brown 
invests $8000 in a good farm which he rents to a tenant. Under 
present farming conditions which man invests more wisely? 
Which man gets larger returns per year; how much larger? 
Monroe Standardized General Survey Scale in Arithme- 
tic—(1la) This scale is printed in Forms 1, 2, and 3, and 
in each form there are scales I and II. Scale I in each 
form is used with grades 3, 4, and 5 and scale II with 
grades 6, 7, and 8. Scale I is of equal difficulty in each 
form though it consists of different exercises. Scale II 
likewise is of equal difficulty in each form and consists of 
different exercises. At the option of the teacher, then, no 
form need be used a second time in the same year. No 
mistake can be made in repeating the same form, say in 
grade III, since the tests are used several months apart.

Directions for Administering Tests—(a) General. The 
same general directions should be observed in using these 
tests as have been presented heretofore for general 
observance. 
(b) Specific. Since the time limit is very short, 30 
seconds for some tests, a stop watch is desirable but an 
ordinary watch with a second hand will do. If the latter 
is used note carefully the beginning of each test and 
promptly at the close of the time period stop all work. 
“Do not pause between tests. As soon as time is called 
on one test and the attention of the pupils has been 
secured, begin with the directions for the next.” 
After necessary explanations are made to the children 
the tests should be distributed by monitors. The ex- 
aminer should not distribute the papers himself. First, 
require that the blanks, name, sex, etc., be filled by the 
children. In the third grade, part of this may need to be 
done by the teacher but at least require that each child’s 
name is written into the proper blank. While the blanks 
are being filled the examiner should be careful not to 
allow any of the pupils to work any of the tests. 
Ask pupils to raise their right hands after the blanks 
are filled, resting the hand on the elbow, to avoid fatigue. 
This position of the hand should be maintained between 
each test. 
(c) To be Read to Pupils. “Do not do any of the ex- 
amples until I tell you to begin work. When the signal 
to begin is given do as many of the examples as you can 
in the time allowed. Do not check your work but try 
to have each example right the first time you do it. 
Try each example once and then pass on to the next. 
Do all of your work on the test paper.”

  302 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
For tests 5, 6, and 7 directions make clear what should 
be done. In test 7 the answer is given with the excep- 
tion of the decimal point. The answer should be written 
in the proper position and the decimal point in its proper 
place. Ciphers should be placed before or after the 
answers whenever they are necessary. 
Directions for Scoring—A pupil’s score is based upon 
the number of examples he does correctly. For some 
tests the number of examples right is his score. In 
other tests the number right is to be multiplied or di- 
vided by a certain number in order to obtain the pupil’s 
score. This is done in order to give each test the proper 
weight in the total score. When such a reduction of 
the number of examples is required it is indicated at 
the top of the tests in the place where the score is to be 
written. 
After the scores for each test have been entered they 
are added, and their sum, which is the pupil’s total score, 
is to be written in the upper right hand corner of the 
first page. In Scale II a correction of 16 is also added 
to form the corrected score. This addition is necessary 
in order to make the score on Scale II comparable with 
the scores on Scale I.

Standards have been derived for Form 1 and they may 
be used with Form 2; however, more perfect standards 
for the latter form are in preparation. 
“These standards are based‘upon tests which were for 
the most part given early in the school year. The returns 
are about equally distributed between rural and city 
schools.” 
Monroe’s Standardized General Survey Scale in Arith- 
metic in the Public Schools.—This arithmetic test, Scale I, 
Form 1, was administered to a third grade enrolling 38 
children. The directions explained above were observed 
in giving the tests. At the conclusion of Test 8 the 
papers were collected; all the exercises worked were 
marked correct or incorrect, with the use of the printed 
answers which appear on pages 6-8 of the Teacher’s 
Handbook. Next the number of rights in each test was 
recorded in the proper blank and the necessary operation 
was performed as suggested on the blank. This answer, 
together with other answers in each of the eight tests, 
were added, which sum was entered in the upper right 
hand corner of the front page of the child’s paper. This 
sum constitutes the pupil’s score. The scores were then 
arranged in a distribution table, here included, and the 
median was estimated. 
Interpreting Results—The distribution table reveals a 
large range of results, scores ranging from 2 to 21, in- 
clusive. This fact at once reveals the need of reclassifi- 
cation of pupils, also the need of group and individual 
teaching. A well classified and well taught class covers 
a small range. This class, as a whole, is a little below 
the January standard. Five of the pupils seemed to mis- 
understand what was expected of them; one not trying 
Test 1, three not trying Test 2, and one adding instead

directions it is probable that the median of the class 
would have reached the standard. 
Groups (a) Superior. One pupil, Howard, earned a 
score of 21.3. Since grade IV standard is 25, he is 
entitled to promotion into the fourth grade arithmetic 
class. 
(b) Average. Twenty-three pupils are at or above 
the average. These are holding their own and need no 
especial help. A few of the better pupils in this group 
may be made to profit from the enriched curriculum. 
(c) Special. Of the 38 pupils in this class, 14, approxi- 
mately one-third, fall below the average ability of the

Howard, Bertha, Ralph, Clara, Loraine, Theodore, Ethel,

  ARITHMETIC 305 
Alice, Mame, should receive especial help with simple 
addition sums. On at least one day in the week they 
should constitute a group when such sums are drilled 
upon. ‘These drills should be motivated with various 
devices, and methods, such as the following: 
1. Drill cards containing type problems, as, 
8 2 i, 3 2 5 4 2 
0 5 2 5 9 1 3 2 
These cards, made from heavy paper, should each con- 
tain about 20 drill problems per card. The pupils 
should copy the problems and work them. Work for 
speed by noting who finishes first or who works most of 
them in a period of time as 5 or 10 minutes. 
2. Flash cards may be used for drill purposes. 
Face of Card Rear of Card 
6 
a 
For the teacher’s convenience the rear of the card 
should bear the answer. 
3. Distribute perception cards among children. Name 
a number, such as 10; and those having cards whose sum 
is 10 go forward and place the cards on the blackboard 
ledge. Then another number is named, and the game 
continues as before. 
4, Draw a picture of a wagon on the blackboard. Fill 
the wagon with bales of hay, or cakes of ice, or some- 
thing else familiar to the children. Write a number 
combination in each bale. Ask children to help pull the 
load. Maybe one horse can pull it and maybe a team 
will be necessary. If one child can name all the combi- 
nations correctly, he (the horse) has drawn the load. 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
    306 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
Similar games consist of packing a lunch basket for a 
picnic, packing a trunk to go away on a visit, picking 
apples from a tree, and so on. 
5. Have children walk across a pond on stones drawn 
on the blackboard. Upon the stones write a number of 
combinations. If a child can give correct results to all 
the combinations he has crossed the pond. If an error 
is made he has fallen into the water. 
6. Draw a railroad track on the board. Let the chil- 
dren take a trip from Superior to Chicago. The train 
stops at many stations. A combination is written at 
each station. The conductor must call out all the 
stations (name answers to all combinations); see how 
many can be conductor for a whole trip. 
7. Climbing the ladder. (Smith.) The teacher draws 
a ladder on the blackboard, placing a number combina- 
tion on each step. The pupil begins at the bottom and 
climbs as far as he is able. When he makes a mistake 
or does not answer with reasonable promptness, he falls 
off and another takes place. The successive combina- 
tions when the table of 3’s is being learned might be 
2 plus 3, 3 plus 4, 3 plus 5, 3 plus 4, 5 plus 3, 3 plus 6. 
8. Make lists of all the combinations that make given 
numbers. Children enjoy doing this. 
9. “I’m thinking of a number.” Let one child stand 
before the class and think of a number, say between 1 
and 12. The other children try to guess it by asking 
questions, as: “Are you thinking 2 plus 4?” He 
answers: “I am not thinking of 6.” When the correct 
answer is guessed, he says: “Yes, it is 7” (or whatever 
the number may be). The child who guesses the correct 
number has the next turn to be it. 
10. Place upon the board a row of combinations:
-P-A-G-E-325

6 8 9 7 1 8 4 5 7 
4 2 3 4 3 2 5 2 3 
oe — = ex Som _ _— _ — etc. 
Two children are sent to the board. One begins at one 
end and the other at the other end. At the word “Start” 
they begin to write results as rapidly as they can. Count 
to see which wrote the larger number of results correctly. 
This stimulates children to work rapidly. Boys might 
race with girls or one row with another. 
Many other games might be submitted as corrective 
devices. Since it is established experimentally that speed 
in number work begets accuracy, therefore, games when 
used should move with vigor. 
(d) Individual Diagnosis. Since a number of the 
pupils in this third grade class are distinctly low in addi- 
tion ability, thirteen in number, their individual weak- 
nesses should be sought. Observance of their working 
procedure will reveal to the teacher individual difficulties, 
which being recognized should point in the direction 
that remedial teaching should assume. 
Courtis (6) enumerates a number of individual diffi- 
culties, some of which are mentioned below. 
1. Child’s movements very slow, difficult, steady. 
2. Child’s movements rapid, variable—symptoms of 
nervous strain. 
3. Child counts on fingers, or makes dots with pencil. 
4. Child’s habits good, work steady, answers wrong. 
Monroe (11e) + discusses at length methods with which 
to correct these difficulties. 
The pupils, by being required to do a few exercises 
orally, will disclose their types of difficulties further.

308 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
They may use wasteful methods, the correction for which 
is the teaching of an abbreviated phraseology. 
Diagnosing Results in Other Operations.—This 3rd grade 
attained a median of four rights in the subtraction exer- 
cises of Test 2. Nineteen of the pupils, a half, fall below 
the median. These constitute a group which should 
receive treatment and corrective help after the plan 
explained for use with the group low on Test 1 in 
addition. 
The weaknesses of the pupils in the other tests, so far 
as the course of study requires that the fundamental 
operations be taught in grade III, can be diagnosed as 
illustrated with Tests 1, 2. 
Principles of Method (11f).—Certain principles of 
method in arithmetic were listed on previous pages in 
this chapter; others especially pertinent to lower grades 
are given below. 
1. “The child should understand the meaning of the 
combinations he is answering.” 
“Experimental evidence shows that logical or mean- 
ingful material is memorized more quickly and with less 
effort than material which has no meaning.” It is impor- 
tant that the meaning of the operation be understood. 
The child may develop a few of the combinations but he 
should not be required to develop all of them. 
2. Not all of the combinations are equally difficult. 
Drill on the difficult ones particularly. The degree of 
difficulty of a combination to any one child is an “indi- 
vidual peculiarity,” hence, class drills must provide for 
individual practice. 
3. In column addition, grouping digits to make 10 or 
some other convenient number is not helpful. A variety 
of procedure in grouping should be encouraged.
-P-A-G-E-327

4. “The Austrian, or additive, method of subtraction 
is not superior to the take-away method.” Neither 
method is yet proven to be superior to the other.

CHAPTER XI 
DIAGNOSIS IN GEOGRAPHY 
Questions 
1. Which should be stressed more in the teaching of geography, 
memory for geographical facts or thinking ability in geography? 
2. To what extent can the problem-project method be used in teach- 
ing geography? In which grades can it best be used? 
3. Why is diagnosis in geography more difficult than in reading or 
arithmetic? 
Courtis Standard Supervisory Tests in Geography.—(4) 
These tests concern locational geography of cities and 
states in our Country. The nature of the tests is revealed 
through a study of the directions accompanying them. 
For that reason the first page of the test is reproduced on 
the following page, with the exercise on the location of 
cities. An answer card facilitates scoring. 
Hahn-Lackey Geography Scale——(6) The most complete 
scale for measuring geographical abilities is the Hahn- 
Lackey Scale for Measuring Ability of Children in 
Geography in Grades 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The scale consists 
of 224 geography questions, graded according to diffi- 
culty. The questions are arranged by difficulty into 24 
steps or columns. The steps are designated with the 
letters of the alphabet. The scale can be put to several 
uses, some of which according to Hahn and Lackey are: 
1. To measure a pupil’s ‘ability in geography for his promotion or 
classification.

Parts of three columns of the scale are appended on 
the following page. 
Directions for giving the tests are reproduced verbatim 
from the scale. 
1. Do not impose a time limit. 
2. Select from four to ten exercises from the list given in any one 
column. Write your selection of exercises for the test on the black- 
board and proceed as in an ordinary school examination. 
3. Give the following instructions to the pupils taking the test: “You 
will be given enough time to answer as many of these exercises as you 
can. Kindly read each exercise carefully to get its exact meaning, 
then write the best answer you can in the fewest words. Complete 
sentences are not necessary; words or phrases will do. You are not 
expected to be able to answer all the exercises. Some of them were 
made difficult on purpose; but if you can answer the difficult ones, 
the credit due you will be that much greater. At any rate, please 
try hard to answer every exercise. Ask no questions about any of the 
exercises in the test. If your teachers should permit you to ask ques- 
tions and then answer them for you, it would defeat the purpose of 
the test and your answers could not be used.” 
4. In scoring answers to exercises consisting of two or more parts, 
give credit for each part answered correctly. In general, give credit 
for an answer that clearly indicates a knowledge of the idea involved 
in the exercise, Copies of directions indicating specifically what to

teachers. According to directions the papers of 102 
children were marked with the use of the key. Since

  (a) Results from Problem Method. The instructor of 
the pupils represented, Table LX XII, is an enthusiast 
in the problem method of teaching geography. In her 
classes the median results on both types of questions in 
both grades considerably exceeds the standard. The 
problem method of teaching while not neglecting fact 
emphasizes the thought and relationship content of 
geography, which raises two questions regarding this 
method of instruction, namely, (1) Is factual geography 
neglected with use of the problem method? (2) Is the 
thought content realized? 
In answer to question (1) it is clear that factual geog- 
raphy is efficiently taught through use of the problem 
method, for the median on fact questions in grade VI 
exceeds the standard by 3.7 per cent and the median in 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
  320 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
grade VII falls at .6 per cent below the standard (Table 
LXXII). 
Answering question (2) the content side of geography 
is more than realized through use of the problem method 
of instruction. The grade VI median is 13 per cent above 
the grade standard and the grade VII median is 9 per 
cent above the standard. 
(b) Results from Traditional Method. The instructor 
of pupils in Table LX XIII employed the traditional 
method almost exclusively. By consulting the table we 
note that the medians for fact and thought questions 
combined, in grades 6A, 6B, 7A, 7B in each instance 
but one, fall short of the class standard. Section 7A, 
wherein the median exceeds the standard by 2.5 per cent, 
had been taught quite considerably through use of the 
problem method. 
The traditional method emphasizes factual geography 
and obviously we expect to obtain high medians from 
the fact question results. These expectations are not 
fulfilled for the medians on fact questions in the four 
classes are below standard. Grade VII produces a 
better showing than grade VI because, according to the 
disposition of the principal, that grade had been taught 
geography the previous year through the problem 
method. 
While emphasizing fact, does the traditional method 
enhance thought? The median results for thought are 
not only exceeded by the standards but also they are 
lower than the fact medians. (See Table LXXIII.) 
The problem method of teaching geography is superior 
to the traditional method in that: 
1. It secures better general results.
-P-A-G-E-339
GEOGRAPHY 321 
2. It gives proper prominence to teaching factual 
geography. 
3. It secures superior thought and relationship content. 
4. It does not, as does the traditional method, empha- 
size one aspect of the work at the expense of another. 
Problems in Geography.—A problem should be so far 
related to the apperceptive mass of the child that he may 
use it in his attack but the problem should also involve 
the securing of additional information. A problem if 
rightly approached will make pupils think as well as 
memorize; will make them gather information from the 
textbooks, encyclopedias, library books, tables, graphs, 
pictures, mathematical calculations, maps, magazines, 
newspapers and other sources; will make them study 
minor problems; will make them enter into projects; 
will make them correlate work with literature, history 
and current events; will make them enter into debates. 
A number of problems devised by students in the 
author’s classes in methods of teaching have been re- 
vised by him and are here submitted for use in teaching 
geography. The list includes several types of prob- 
lems, namely, those on teaching foreign countries, on 
teaching the United States as a whole, on teaching the 
United States by industries, by sections, by cities, and by 
regions. 
(a) Problems on Foreign Countries. 
1. praziz—Brazil, a country nearly as large as the 
United States and known to European countries for over 
400 years, has a population only one fourth as large as 
that of the United States and is just beginning to take 
a prominent part in international affairs. Why is this 
so? 
2. BRITISH ISLANDS—Though a small group, the British 
 
-P-A-G-E-340
  
322 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
Islands are the heart of a great world kingdom. What 
geographic factors contribute to this influence? 
3. Russt1a—Although Russia is about as large as all 
the other countries of Europe combined and has a popu- 
lation about twice that of any other European country, 
it ranks very low in civilization and progress. How does 
geography explain this? 
4, russ1A—Russia is such a large country that she 
should be one of the leading nations of the world. Why 
does she not lead? 
5. GERMANY—What geographic factors made it hard 
to overcome Germany in the World War? 
6. FRANCE—Suppose that France is shut off from all 
the rest of the world. Could she support herself over a 
long period of years if she added no new territory to her 
domains? 
7. JApAN—Japan is spread out over a thousand small 
islands. A century ago she was a weak, heathen nation. 
Today Japan is one of the world powers. From the 
standpoint of what we learn in geography, how can 
Japan’s great progress be explained? 
(b) United States as a Whole. 
1. The United States is able to supply my home with 
almost everything that it needs, requiring to import but 
a little from foreign lands and being able to spare many 
of her products, sending them abroad. Why is this so? 
2. Inside of one hundred and fifty years the United 
States has become one of the leading nations of the 
world. Millions of people from the corners of the earth 
have migrated to this country. How does geography 
account for this wealth and strength in our country? 
(c) United States Taught Through Major Industries. 
1, Agriculture is the most important industry in the
-P-A-G-E-341
GEOGRAPHY 323 
United States. This was brought home to us forcefully 
during the recent war; we found out then that without 
the help of the farmers we could not have won the war. 
Why should this great army of workers in agriculture 
be so important? 
2. MinnRALS—One of the reasons why the United 
States has become a world power is due to her abundance 
of all kinds of minerals. How are minerals instrumental 
in making our country powerful? 
3. ForEsts—The primeval forests in the United States 
were among the most valuable in the world; they covered 
vast areas and furnished us with a great variety of woods. 
Let us try to find out how our forests have helped us to 
become a great country. 
4, risHinc—The United States fishing grounds not 
only supply our country with fish but we also export 
millions of dollars’ worth of fish every year. How has 
this fact helped our country to become great? 
5. MINING—The mines in the United States are among 
the greatest in the world. How does our mineral wealth 
help our national development? 
6. corron—Why does the United States produce so 
much more cotton than other countries? 
7. LUMBERING—Why is lumbering carried on exten- 
sively near the Great Lakes? How does this compare 
with the amount of lumbering carried on elsewhere in 
the United States? 
8. meat—Why is meat packing an important industry 
in the United States? 
9. commEeRceE—How great a part do the railroads of 
the United States play in our domestic commerce in 
comparison with our waterways? 
10. commerce—America has ranked among the great- 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
324 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
est commercial nations of the world. Why has it been 
possible for us to attain this position? 
11. commerce—Why do America’s great railroad lines 
run almost exclusively east and west? 
12. rormstry—The wood crops of the United States 
give employment to more persons than any other indus- 
try except agriculture; and the lumber, furniture and 
other kinds of businesses depending upon wood crops, 
employ more capital and produce a larger value of prod- 
ucts than any other manufacturing industry. How can 
we explain this great importance of lumbering? 
13. stock RAISING—Why is stock raising a most exten- 
sive industry just east of the Rocky Mountains? 
14. TRANSPORTATION—The transportation of goods is 
one of the greatest industries in this country. Show how 
this explains the distribution of our population? 
15. LUMBERING—Lumbering is an important industry 
all over the United States. Why has it become so 
important? 
16. wHEAtT—The north central part of the United 
States supplies wheat enough to feed us and to send 
much of it to other countries. What facts are responsible 
for this wealth of supply? 
17. coau—The United States produced over 500,- 
000,000 tons of coal in 1910. This is one third of the 
world’s coal output. How does coal mining influence 
our country geographically? 
18. MANUFACTURING—The northern and northeastern 
parts of the United States are great manufacturing re- 
gions. How has this come about? 
(d) United States Through Regional Teaching. 
1. ppsprts—Of what importance is the fact that one- 
fifth of this country is a desert?
-P-A-G-E-343
GEOGRAPHY 325 
2. East and west of the Rockies—What effect do the 
Rocky Mountains in this country have upon the regions 
on either side of it? 
3. Why is stock raising the most extensive industry 
just east of the Rocky Mountains? 
4, The entire western third of North and South Da- 
kota, Nebraska, and Kansas, as well as the Great Plains 
farther west, are given over mainly to ranching. Why 
is ranching so extensive here? 
(e) United States—Study of Outstanding Cities. 
1. Compare the merits of San Francisco Bay with 
Puget Sound. Which city, San Francisco or Seattle, has 
the best chance to become more influential in world 
commerce? 
2. Pittsburgh is situated in the plateau section of the 
Appalachian Highland. It has become a city of great 
importance. How has this come about? 
8. Boston is the chief trade center of Massachusetts 
and the largest city of the state. Near Boston are 
many cotton, woolen, leather and rubber factories. This 
city is one-seventh the size of New York, still it ranks 
about the third among our American cities in foreign 
commerce. Why is Boston a world port in America? 
4. Chicago—What conditions have caused Chicago to 
become the second city in size in this country?

States. What facts have caused it to experience such 
wonderful growth? 
6. New York—What has made New York the me- 
tropolis of America?

9. New Orleans—Why is New Orleans a local and 
world trade center? 
10. New York is the largest city in the United States. 
Why is not Aberdeen just as large and just as important? 
(f) United States—Sectional Studies. 
1. ceNTRAL states—The greater portion of these states 
consists of fertile prairies. Immense crops of grain are 
grown here. The grass lands support millions of cattle, 
horses, and sheep. Here soft and hard wood forests are 
extensive. How do Americans utilize these resources? 
2. MIDLAND ATLANTIC—Why are the Middle Atlantic 
States termed the “Gateway of the Nation”? 
3. SOUTHERN sEcTION—The Southern section has al- 
most as many resources as the Middle Atlantic, still it is 
slower in its development. How does geography explain 
this? Is this development still sluggish? 
4. NEW ENGLAND AND SOUTHERN sTATES—Geographi- 
cally the New England section is more advanced than the 
Southern Section. How can we explain this? 
(g) Miscellaneous. 
Irrication—The plains of Montana and South Dakota 
have more rainfall than the plateaus between the Rocky 
Mountains and the Cascades in Oregon and the Sierra 
Nevada in California. The soil in both localities is of 
equal fertility and the soil in the plains of Montana and 
eastern South Dakota holds moisture better. Why 
do farmers in the western plateaus have such abundant 
crops?

so strongly in this respect? In what ways has the climate 
influenced different sections of the United States? 
Untirep Stares—Scenic—Why are the Rocky Mountains 
called the “Wonderland of America’? 
Unirep States Poputation—(a) Draw a straight line 
from Omaha to New York City. Most of our population

north and south of it. Why do so many people live here? 
(b) The transportation of goods is one of the greatest 
industries in the United States. How does this affect the 
distribution of our population? 
Review—Many of these problems are in the nature of 
review work. 
Outlines for studying problems should be made by the 
pupils and the teacher working jointly. It is advisable 
for the teacher to have her outline prepared in advance 
of the time she helps the pupils with theirs. Making of 
the joint outline involves discussion of geographical 
facts from the standpoint of their value, their relative 
importance, and their organization. The outline should 
be so devised as to answer the problem under discussion. 
An outline for teacher’s use on one of the preceding prob- 
lems is here submitted.

CHAPTER XII 
DIAGNOSIS IN HISTORY 
Question 
1. The work of a history class is analyzed through the use of a diag- 
nostic test. The class shows weakness in: 
a. Ability to give cause and effect relations, 
b, Ability to think deductively, 
c. Ability to organize related events into large movements. 
How would you proceed in correcting these weaknesses? 
History tests and scales have been devised by Bell and 
McCullum, Hahn, Harlan, Starch, Von Wagenen and 
others. The Bell and McCullum tests emphasize measur- 
ing the factual phase of history instruction. Their use 
will, therefore, reveal the extent to which facts have 
been taught by the teacher and memorized by the pupil, 
and the effectiveness of traditional history teaching. If 
the chief purposes of history teaching in the elementary 
school are realized, then the Bell-McCullum test cannot 
be effectively used inasmuch as it fails to test pupils’ 
intelligence with respect to the more crucial activities, 
conditions and problems of present-day life. 
The Von Wagenen American History Scale consists 
of an information, a thought, and a character judging 
scale. The information scale, though extensive, confines 
its questions to the past rather than the present genera- 
tion. The thought scale is a desirable contribution to 
335
-P-A-G-E-354
  336 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
the testing of historic knowledge and ability. A few of 
the thought questions are here reproduced. 
“1. Before the steamboats were made people used to travel on the 
ocean in sailboats. Steamboats were not made until a long, long time 
after the European people came to make their homes in America. How 
do you think these early European settlers came to America? 
“3. A hundred years ago it took a letter several days to go from 
New York to Boston. To-day it takes only a few hours. Why do you 
think it took letters so much longer to go from New York to Boston 100 
years ago than it does to-day? 
“22. At the close of the Revolutionary War many of the people 
in America were driven from their homes by official acts of a new 
state government, their property was taken, and they were deprived 
of the right to vote or to hold public offices. How can you account 
for such action?” 
The character judging tests, fifteen in all, are a new 
feature in scale construction, one which should be 
encouraged ; however, to make them more valuable, choice 
of questions should be made from more recent American 
history. 
Harlan Test of Information in American History —The 
exercises in this test are based upon a study made by 
Bagley and Rugg (1) of the contents of twenty-three 
commonly used American history text books. To secure 
uniformity of results a scoring key is supplied with the 
tests. On the basis of much experimentation, Harlan 
submits tentative standard scores. The median scores 
for end-of-the-year tests are 
7th grade 8th grade 
56 86 
Several of the exercises in the Harlan test are repro- 
duced on the following page.

338 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
The scales are a complete test of the whole subject of 
history and are definitely standardized. They are so 
extensive that they can be used many times without 
repeating a single exercise. They test important and 
essential subject matter, the subject matter that six of 
the modern authors of American history texts treat in 
common. 
The diagnostic possibilities of the scales are presented 
by their author in this language. 
“They are diagnostic. They test the following history 
abilities: 
. The ability to give time relations. 
. The ability to give place relations. 
. The ability to give cause and effect relations. 
The ability to think inductively in history. 
The ability to think deductively. 
The ability to see the interrelations between the past and the 
present. 
. The ability to make historical comparisons and judgments. 
The ability to organize related events into large movements. 
. Memory ability. 
Compensation ability.” Seen gaRene _ 
Directions for administering and scoring are printed 
in full on the scales. They almost reproduce word for 
word the directions for using and scoring the Hahn- 
Lackey geography scales. May standards only are sub- 
mitted for comparing the history abilities of children. 
Portions of scales, parts of columns, M, O, R, and S 
are reproduced on the opposite page.

atlases, magazines, and other relevant material in pre- 
paring the examination problem. One suitable examina- 
tion problem may be stated thus: “Summarize gains 
made in human liberty by the American people from 
1607 to 1922.”

Subsidiary Problems—A major problem reveals sub- 
sidiary problems, the teaching of which partly reviews 
facts already taught and also involves the teaching of 
new historical material. One such subsidiary problem 
arising out of the theme on growth of human liberty 
is here stated. 
Subsidiary Problem: “The acquisition of human lib- 
erties engrossed efforts that began with the earliest 
inception of our country and are still in progress. Is this 
continuous effort to gain liberty worth the price we pay 
for it?” 
A. Theme—Price paid for human liberty. 
B. Outline of study. 
1. In Revolutionary War—price. 
1) In cost of human life. 
Pivotal battles—Lexington, Concord, Bunker 
Hill, Trenton, Valley Forge, Saratoga, 
Yorktown. 
2) In efforts of leaders and others. 
Washington, Franklin, Morris, Allen, Paine, 
LaFayette, etc. 
Rank and file of citizenry, women. 
8) In financial output. 
Morris, Hamilton’s measures, Whiskey Re- 
bellion, poverty. 
4) In general suffering. 
2. In War of 1812 for economic independence— 
price. 
1) In property destroyed by enemy. 
2) In human life. 
8) In cash.

8. In civic strife bitterness, as 
1) Webster and Calhoun. 
2) Lincoln and Douglas. 
3) Kansas border warfare. 
4) John Brown’s Raid. 
4. In Civil War—price. 
1) Over 700,000 lives. 
2) Pivotal battles on land and sea, as Merrimac 
and Monitor, Bull Run, Vicksburg, Gettys- 
burg, Grant’s final campaign, ete. 
3) Money—Over $6,000,000,000 plus pensions. 
Confederate debt never paid. 
4) Efforts of leaders and rank and file of citizens. 
5) Property destruction, crippling of southern 
industries. 
6) Foreign difficulties—Alabama Claims, Maxi- 
milian affair. 
5. In World War—price. 
1) Suffering humanity. 
2) Staggering national debts. 
3) Human life. 
4) Destruction of property. 
5) Setback to progress of civilization. 
Problem Examination—Considering the price paid for 
human liberty, what thoughts are suggested by the sing- 
ing of: 
“My country! ’tis of thee, 
Sweet land of liberty, 
Of thee I sing: 
Land where my fathers died! 
Land of the pilgrims’ pride! 
From every mountain side 
Let freedom ring!’”

CHAPTER XIII 
DIAGNOSIS IN HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Questions 
1. Secondary school students are more mature than elementary 
school students. Can they profit from diagnostic testing and remedial 
teaching? If so, how? 
2. Are group and individual teaching in the high school productive 
of effective results? 
3. Is it desirable to make all students devote a full year to a year 
subject, like algebra? If not, under what conditions would you pro- 
mote irregularly the extra bright pupils? 
High School Tests.—Several tests have been devised for 
measuring pupils’ abilities in the acquisition of high 
school subjects. Tests have been devised for pur- 
poses of measuring pupil accomplishments in algebra, 
geometry, physics, Latin, ancient history and reading, 
very satisfactorily. We shall, owing to the limitations 
of this chapter, confine our discussion to a study of 
algebra and high school reading. 
Algebra Tests. Hotz, Monroe, Rugg and Clark have 
devised serviceable algebra tests. The Rugg and Clark 
tests are rather difficult but useful for diagnostic pur- 
poses. The Monroe tests assume that the equation is 
the crucial feature of algebra testing. 
The Hotz First Year Algebra Scales (3) represent five 
different phases of algebraic teaching, namely: 
1. Addition and Subtraction. 
2. Multiplication and Division.

Two of the Hotz Scales are designed to test the 
achievement of students in the fundamental operations, 
two of them test the ability of students in handling the 
instruments of quantitative thinking and the last is com- 
posed of typical problems in first year algebra. 
“Two series of each scale are offered—Series A and 
Series B. Series B is the long one and contains from 
eleven to twenty-five exercises in each scale. Series A is 
shorter and contains from eight to twelve exercises in

each scale. It is composed of exercises taken from 
Series B. It covers just as wide a range of difficulty 
and has the added advantage of having the intervals 
between successive exercises or problems approximately 
equal.” 
Professor Hotz recommends Series A when the testing

time is limited and if the purpose of the test is primarily 
the determination of degrees of attainment. Series B, 
because it contains a more complete and richer variety 
of exercises, is preferable for diagnostic purposes. 
Obviously there are inroads on the time of the class 
if all the scales are given every three months, hence, 
using only a limited number of them is the forced option 
of the instructor. In such a case the Equation and

HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 349 
Formula Scale is recommended for initial and the Prob- 
lem Scale for secondary choice. 
When to Use the Scale——Evidently the scales cannot be 
used until a class has studied algebra for some time. 
Since the comparative standards are for 3, 6, and 9 
months’ intervals, the scales should be given as nearly 
as possible at the termination of each three-month 
interval.

  Directions for Using Scales—‘“While the test sheets are 
being distributed, ask the students to wait for all direc- 
tions before they do anything at all with the tests. 
When all are ready say to the class, ‘Write your name in 
the first blank space. In the next blank space to your 
right tell how old you are. Give this in full years to 
your nearest birthday.’ Fill remaining blanks. 
“After the sheets are properly headed, say to the class: 
   
-P-A-G-E-368
  350 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
‘The exercises on this sheet are in addition and subtrac- 
tion (collection of terms), (multiplication and division, 
equation and formula, graphs, problems, as the case may 
be). Work directly on these sheets. Take the exercises 
in the order in which they are given. Work as many as 
you possibly can and be sure you get them right. If 
you come to one you cannot do, leave it out and pass 
on to the next.’ 
“In the Multiplication-Division test all answers must 
be reduced to their simplest forms. For the graph Scale, 
let the students use ruler. 
“For the Problem Scale add: ‘In all the problems 
which call for the equation, e.g., No. 4, simply state the 
equation which will solve the problem. That is, if you 
were given this problem: A coat and hat cost $30.00, 
the coat cost five times as much as the hat, find the cost 
of each. The equation would be, X + 5X = $80.00.’ 
(Then write the equation on the board.) 
“Although the exercises and problems may be worked 
on scratch paper, it is desirable to have all work on the 
test sheets.”

Hotz Scales in Practice.1 To illustrate the class room 
use of the Hotz Algebra Scales, Series B, and the conse- 
quent diagnosis of class abilities the Addition and Sub- 
traction Scale, Series B, was administered to a pre-normal 
school class of high school grade. The class consisted of 
10 freshmen, 10 sophomores, 5 juniors, 3 seniors, and 1 
post graduate, a total of 29 students. The test results 
are given in the class record card on the opposite page. 
The table is interpreted thus: Pupil 1, a postgraduate 
(pg), worked correctly Exercises 1-7, 9, 10, 12-15, and 
20; failed on Exercises 8, 11, 16-19 and had no time to 
work 21. She solved 14 exercises correctly. Pupil 2, 
fourth year high school, solved correctly Exercises 1-10 
and 12-14, failed on 11, time expired after the solution 
of Exercise 14. She worked correctly 13 exercises. The 
last line at the bottom denotes that Exercises 1, 2, 3, 4, 
being incorrectly solved 3, 3, 2 and 2 times, were easy 
for the class, whereas Exercise 5 was solved 11 times in- 
correctly by 29 students. X denotes exercises not 
attempted, which designation was used on exercises up 
2Mrs. Townsend, assistant professor in mathematics at the State 
Teachers College, kindly permitted the administration of this test to 
her class in December, 1921.

pared with the standard, is 
Medians: as aos. 5.8%, 10.25 
Gtanidard eo. ssa. ck eae ss 9.70 
Interpreting Results——The class median exceeds the 
standard for the three-month group. By consulting 
Table LXXVII, Exercises 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 show diffi- 
culty. Such difficulties arise out of two causes, first, 
Exercises 5, 6 are hard for a backward group of students; 
second, Exercises 8, 9, and 10 are difficult, because the 
class had not completed, up to the time the test was 
administered, all algebra work involved in type Exer- 
cises 8, 9, and 10. 
Remedial Teaching —On certain days of the week time 
should be set aside for corrective teaching. Possibly 
one-half of the class period may be devoted to this aim 
of the recitation. 
(a) Group I. Exercise 5, solving for the unknown in, 
7x—x+6—4= is difficult for students 6, 9, 11, 
18, 15, 16, 17, 20, 24, 26, and 28. They constitute one- 
third of the class enrollment. Call them Group I. 
While the remaining students may be given a few prob- 
lems which enrich the algebra course, Group I should 
receive special explanations and drill on exercises ex- 
emplified in the difficult type, ie., Exercise 5. Experi- 
mentally, it is proven that mathematical difficulties are 
specific and individual, which fact implies that one type 
of exercise involves different difficulties to a group of 
students. This fact precludes thought of general drill 
on Exercise 5 and implies a diagnosis of special difficulties 
with this exercise and consequent remedial teaching. 
On examination of the test papers of students in 
Group I, we learn that: 
 
-P-A-G-E-375
  HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 357 
1. Nine respondents did not combine “6 — 4.” 
2. Two made combination obtaining — 2. 
3. One did not combine x’s. 
4, Eight upon combining x’s obtained 8x. 
Remedial teaching should be based upon these obser- 
vations, such teaching further implying a regrouping 
of Group I. In this group most of the students failed 
to realize three facts. It must be made clear that 
7x — x is not to be treated as if the quantities 7x and 
— x are superimposed above each other, then changing 
sign of “—x” and adding. Eight students made this 
error and got “8x” as the answer. All the students ex- 
cept three did not know what to do with “6—4.” This 
seems unbelievable but their answers indicate that they 
could not solve this part of the equation or that they 
deemed it of no consequence. This error in judgment 
must be corrected. A third error needing correction is 
that algebraically terms can be added or subtracted and 
the results recorded even if all the addends have not the 
same name. Two of the addends, 7x, — x, in this exer- 
cise have the same name, namely, x, and their sum is 
6x; the other addends, 6, — 4, have no name, and their 
sum is 2. Since addends whose sums have different 
names cannot be combined under one name, their sums 
can be combined with the plus sign between them, giv- 
ing for answer 6x plus 2. The above points can be made 
clear by requiring the students to find the sum of 7 
rings, —1 ring, 6, and —4. Adding the “rings” gives 
“6 rings” for an answer; adding the nameless digits gives 
2 for an answer. We cannot further combine “6 rings” 
and “2” but we may indicate the desired operation by 
writing the partial answers in a horizontal line and ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
358 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
pressing between them the further operation desired, 
thus, 6 rings plus 2. 
(b) Group IJ. This group found difficulty with Exer- 
cise 8, requiring combination of terms, and reads 20x — 
(10x + 5x) = . This exercise was difficult for 
students 1, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, and 20, of which 
students 13, 15, 16, and 20 had trouble with Exercise 5. 
An examination into the work of each student in Group 
II discloses that the main difficulty is with removing 
parenthesis and changing signs when the quantity in 
parentheses is preceded by a — sign. 
Two members of this group reasoned that the — sign 
preceding the parenthesis is also changed when the 
parentheses are removed, hence, their logical answer was 
35x. In Ex. 8, a binomial, 10x + 5x, is to be subtracted 
from a monomial 20x. If the quantities are superim- 
posed above each other, then the signs of the subtrahend 
changed, and the proper operations performed, the 
student will see that the exercise looks thus: 
20x 
—10x plus 5x 
10x — 5x 
The combination of 10x — 5x may next be made. After 
this fact is clear the shorter and more direct step may 
be required, lest the work remain on a very elementary 
basis, and this is not desirable. 
By analyzing the other answers to Exercise 8, further 
diagnosis of exact difficulties with proper correctives can 
be made after methods of suggestion given above. 
(c) Other Groups. In a similar way the difficulties of 
other pupils can be diagnosed for purposes of remedial 
teaching. 
 
-P-A-G-E-377
  HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 359 
(d) Individual Students. (1) Wax. A few students, 
11, 18, 16, 19, 20, 24, and 26, are very weak in addition 
and subtraction, none solving correctly more than six 
exercises out of a required 9.7, the standard. These 
individuals, according to the group plan of instruction, 
will be recipients of special help. Some may need further 
individual assistance. 
(2) Strong. Several of the students possess consid- 
erable ability in algebra. These are of two types, those 
who have worked a large number of problems, missing 
some, and attaining the median in addition and subtrac- 
tion of the “six-month group,” also those who have 
worked more than the average number of problems cor- 
rectly, without a single error up to the point beyond 
which they received no instruction in addition and 
subtraction. Students 1, 2, 5, and 29 belong to the first 
type. Each of these solved at least thirteen problems 
correctly. Students 4, 8, 12, 22, 23, and 25 belong to the 
second type. These ten students are, in all probability, 
able to cover the ground fast enough to complete the 
nine months’ course in six months, if they possess like 
ability in the other phases of algebra work. This sug- 
gestion raises the question of getting fifteen hours’ credit 
for doing six months work, the answer to which is 
simple. If at the end of six or seven months’ time any 
of the strong students can pass a satisfactory examina- 
tion, covering all essential phases of nine months’ work, 
they should be given fifteen hours’ credit earned through 
six or seven months’ class attendance and a fair but com- 
prehensive examination. Such a practice may have the 
disadvantage of creating exceptions to a system. How- 
ever, a system does not exist for the sake of itself. It 
exists for the child; and if its violation does good to the
-P-A-G-E-378
  
  360 DIAGNOSIS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
meritorious with no loss to anyone, the system, if demo- 
cratic and flexible, should not be made to operate so as 
to discourage ability. Educators have accused the 
elementary school of employing a lock-step system. The 
accusation is just. The high school is not entirely free 
of this guilt. A decided advantage of extending promo- 
tion to the worthy consists in capitalizing brains and 
exertion. These students under a flexible, democratic 
system of promotion would be ready to take advanced 
work in mathematics the last three months, or some 
other course, the last quarter of the school year, thus 
economizing the time and money of the student and of 
the institution. 
High School Reading.—Various tests have been devised 
with which to measure high school reading ability. 
Monroe’s Standardized Silent Reading Tests, Revised, 
are standardized for high school as well as for elementary 
grades. These tests measure rate and comprehension in 
the reading of sentences and short paragraphs. Though 
easily administered and scored, they do not meet the 
high school reading situation in that reading ability in 
secondary education counts mostly in terms of the 
ability to comprehend numerous readings from texts 
and references, all of which are couched in lengthy para- 
graphs. In some respects ideal tests of junior and 
senior high school reading ability should reveal abilities 
to understand elementary scientific literature as that 
contained in hygiene, general science, and biology; they 
should reveal abilities to understand elementary, mathe- 
matical language such as is found in junior high school 
arithmetic, algebra and senior high school geometry; 
they should reveal abilities to understand passages from 
the field of history, as ancient, modern, and American; 
 
-P-A-G-E-379
HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 361 
nor should the field of English proper be neglected in 
such tests. In the absence of such tests, paragraph- 
reading tests designed for high school use will serve 
a general purpose, at least. 
Haggerty Reading Examination, Sigma 3——(1) This ex- 
amination was discussed in the chapter on reading. It 
will serve in diagnosing some possible causes of strong 
and weak scholarship through a test of two contributory 
causes of efficient work, namely, vocabulary and para- 
graph reading achievements. Both achievements are of 
a general character, however. 
Haggerty Examination, Sigma 3, in Practice—This test 
was administered to junior and senior high school pupils 
in a small town school system.t The median test results 
are recorded in Table LX XVIII.

  The Haggerty tests are not supplied with standards 
for vocabulary nor paragraph-reading abilities. In lieu 
of such standards the median vocabulary and paragraph 
reading abilities of all pupils in grades VII, VIII and IX, 
will be used for purposes of comparison with the possible 
score,

Diagnosis and remedial teaching might be discussed 
from the standpoint of reading after the plan employed 
in Chapter IX. It is, however, planned here to give 
another version of the possible use of reading test-results 
for diagnostic and remedial purposes. It is recognized 
that Sigma 3 is not a measure of specific reading abilities 
in mathematics, history, and so on; nevertheless, the 
Haggerty Examination will reveal, in part, an answer to 
the question propounded by teachers in the school system 
tested, namely, “Why are many of our students deficient 
in scholarship?” Evidently, there are numerous reasons 
which explain unsatisfactory scholarship, one of which 
is revealed through inefficient reading. 
By consulting Table LXXVIII we find all grades, 
except the eighth, below the Haggerty standard. Table 
LXXIX reveals that the vocabulary and paragraph- 
reading abilities of the pupils are distinctly below the 
possible scores. Further, one-half of the pupils are below 
the median point in the above abilities. Such weak- 
nesses suggest one point of attack upon the issue of 
improving the scholarship. 
Remedial measures in the light of a single test are 
but partial. They suggest the necessity of vocabulary 
building exercises, also of teaching children how to read 
paragraphs intelligently for content. Experimentally, it 
is demonstrated that single reading of paragraphs or
-P-A-G-E-381
   HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 363 
longer passages is less effective than a single reading 
with note taking or single reading with outlining. It 
is also demonstrated that reading assignments based 
upon questions and problems are fruitful of good work. 
With these facts in mind the method of assignment in 
history, science, and so on, should be changed to conform 
with experimental conclusions. Such changes will affect 
results in most high school subjects offered in the course 
of study. The above diagnosis and remedial measures 
are partial but they illustrate how a reading test can be 
used for remedial purposes in improving academic work 
in the high school.

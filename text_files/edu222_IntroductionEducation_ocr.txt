PREFACE 
The school is a social institution, whose function is to 
bridge the gap between the child and society. Hence, the 
professional preparation of teachers must involve a study 
of at least four predominant factors in education: the 
teacher, the child, the subject-matter, and society. 
The purpose of this book is to introduce the ‘pre-service 
teacher and the unprepared in-service teacher to the prob- 
lems of education, and to meet the needs of an introduc- 
tory course to the study of education, which is required 
of practically all students entering teacher-training insti- 
tutions. The text is in the nature of a survey course in 
the field of education. It aims to do for the student what 
the survey courses in literature and the general, science 
courses do for students in those fields. Through a study 
such as this text offers, the student becomes acquainted 
with the various theories current in the field of education, 
the major problems to be solved, present-day practices and 
systems, and the history of modern education. Thus he 
is enabled to get a certain perspective, a point of view, 
which will render him much more intelligent toward the 
more detailed studies to be taken up as he continues ‘his 
training. 
Furthermore, this text not only introduces the student 
to the vast field of education, but, by means of the bibliog- 
raphies following the chapters, it makes possible more 
intensive investigation of the subjects but briefly discussed

in the text. At Colorado State Teachers College this 
course is described in the yearbook as follows: 
Ed. 1. An InvRopuction 10 THE Srupy or Epucation— 
Required of all first year students. 
This course aims to introduce the student to the study of edu- 
cation. It aims to do for education what general science does for 
the later study of specialized subjects in science. The course 
deals with teaching as a profession, the child as an object of 
study, the curriculum, the necessity for good methods, the public 
school organization, educators of the past and present, and many 
other major problems that are met in the field of education. The 
purpose of the course is to orient the student in the great field 
of education and prepare him for the specialized study to come 
later. ; 
In preparing this book the authors have kept con- 
stantly in mind the lack of perspective and: experience 
which characterizes the pre-service teacher, and the in- 
service teacher who lacks professional background. They 
have attempted to express the thought simply and con- 
eretely for beginning students in teacher-training colleges 
and for groups of teachers working together in reading 
circles and study groups. 
Having specially in mind the needs of the instructor in 
assigning supplementary reading, of the student who may 
desire further independent reading, and of those individ- 
uals and groups who may be carrying on study by them- 
selves, the authors have presented at the end of chapters a 
full bibliography of books relative to subjects discussed in 
each chapter. Specific chapters with specific titles indicat- 
ing the material included are listed as an aid in directing 
the student to the particular material which he may desire. 
The questions and problems following the chapters are of 
such nature as to bring out the important principles dis- 
cussed.

PREFACE vii 
The chapters have been grouped into natural units. 
The first three chapters, which make up Part One, con- 
cern the teacher. Part Two deals with the child; Part 
Three with the teaching process; Part Four with the 
organization of the school and the curriculum; and Part 
Five with democracy and the public schools. The in- 
structor will find these units of work valuable in laying 
out his plans, reviewing after study, and giving examina- 
tions. Each part closes with a brief summary of the mate- 
rial discussed, aimed to emphasize the important points 
brought out and to serve as a transition to the next part. 
The pictures included in the book are of living edu- 
eators. This is contrary to usual custom. However, the 
authors wish the beginning student to know about some 
of the men who are making educational history today. 
A set of true-false examination questions has been 
worked out for use with the book. These questions will 
be sent to any instructor who is using the book as a class 
text, and may be secured for student use at moderate cost. 
The authors make no claim for originality in much of 
the material presented, as the very nature of the book 
makes it impossible. They are under obligation to many 
sources and individuals for a large part of the material, 
and to these they have given proper acknowledgment. For 
much of the point of view they are indebted to those 
eminent teachers whose names appear on the dedicatory 
page. 
This book has been taught in manuscript form to 650 
Teachers College freshmen by six different teachers. The. . 
authors are under obligation to these teachers for many 
valuable suggestions incorporated in the book. These 
teachers are: Helen C. Davis, Sonora T. Metsker, Roger 
Q. Mitchell, Clark M. Frasier, Earle U. Rugg, and W. H.

INDIVIDUAL EFFICIENCY IN TEACHING 
Tue TEACHER—THE CHILDREN’s GUIDE 
The teacher may be compared to a guide accompanying 
tourists through new and strange lands, for the teacher 
guides children through such new and | sa! lands as 
arithmetic, history, geography, literature. 
The usefulness of a guide to tourists will depend upon 
his ability to select worth-while places or objects of interest 
and to describe and explain them in such a way as to 
bring out their true worth and significance. A guide may 
be merely of the type of the professional auto driver who 
takes a party-of tourists on a three-day trip through the 
Rocky Mountain National Park. This kind of guide will 
be able to point out the important peaks, give the names 
of the peculiar rock formations, and tell something of the 
animal and plant life. The tourists who travel with him 
will doubtless have a certain knowledge of the points of 
interest, will be able to describe a few of the wild flowers, 
and perhaps give some facts about the animal life. 
The same tourists might take a three-day trip through 
the same park with a naturalist of the ability of the late 
Enos Mills as a guide, or with a geologist who was eager 
to have people know and understand his mountains. Un- 
der such guidance the tourists would gain more than mere 
information: they would gain inspiration and lasting inter- 
est; they would leave eager to return and learn more of the 
place.

  2 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
To the same extent that guides are of small or great 
value to the tourists, so are teachers of little or of real 
help to the children whose efforts they try to direct. 
The road to knowledge and truth is not always plain and easy. 
Children see no familiar landmarks, and it is easy for them to 
get lost and become discouraged. Confidence in their teacher 
and his ability to bring them out all right in the end is their 
strong support. But what if they see him constantly falter and 
blunder ?* 
One writer describes the teacher as: 
ate leader, an inspirer, a guide of children. He helps them 
to short-circuit their learning processes and perfect the methods 
of meeting their needs. He introduces them to new forms of ex- 
perience that they might not hit upon by chance. He sees to it 
that in living fuller and richer lives, they are also becoming 
better equipped to play their part in the larger world of human 
interests and activities.” 
No doubt we would all agree that: 
The most important element in education is the teacher. It is 
true that the right education requires a variety of subject-matter. 
It is likewise true that selection of subject-matter and reflection 
on method are not only useful but indispensable. But the teacher 
must breathe life into the dead bones, and it is the teacher’s task 
to create and foster the spirit of open-minded inquiry, the attitude 
of sympathetic yet critical interest in all matters of human con- 
cern, which is the finest fruit of education.* 
It is evident, then, that the task of the teacher is not an 
easy one. The job iso longer one for amateurs. What 
sort of people should be designated to perform this social 
function? What training should be required of them? 
What qualities should they possess?

INDIVIDUAL EFFICIENCY IN TEACHING 3 
Wuar Pupits THINK or TEACHERS 
One source of information as to the qualities teachers 
should possess is to be found in pupils’ answers to such 
questions as, “In thinking over the teachers who have 
been or still are most helpful to you, tell the qualities in 
them which make the strongest appeal to you.” In a 
study of 550 high-school boys and girls, the following 
qualities were emphasized : patienee, willingness—to—help, 
kindness, clearness, firmness, sense, of humor, cheerfulness 
and leasaniness, sincerity, sympathy, and ability to make 
work interesting. This study shows that from the view- 
point of pupils the personal and social qualities of the 
teacher assume a large proportion. 
‘Another interesting insight into pupils’ estimate of 
teachers is given in the following editorial taken from a 
high-school paper: 
The Many Kinds of Teachers 
One necessity of modern life, which comes in assorted colors, 
is the teacher. There are green teachers, yellow teachers, blue 
teachers, gray teachers, and white teachers., Green teachers are 
usually young and just out of s¢hool.-They remember their own 
school ‘days, the farewell to freedom for nine long months, and 
"so are very sympathetic, but they also remember the stern old 
masters of their school days and so they often assume an at- 
tempted sternness. When ordering a teacher it is best not to 
order a green teacher unless one understands human nature and 
knows that beneath her pretended sternness she is really sympa- 
thetic. 
Yellow teachers are afraid to displease_anyone. They are 
easy to “bluff” and can be persuaded to give you any grade. 
Their classes can easily persuade them not to give long assign- 
ments and can convince them that tests are inadvisable. If you 
wish to bluff your way thru school, lay in a good supply of 
yellow teachers.

  4 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
Blue teachers are the teachers who think the world a cruel 
place ‘because they have to endure our charming company all 
day. They are eternally reminding us that we have six or seven 
teachers to prepare lessons for, while they have to inject knowl- 
edge into about 100 heads, dense or otherwise. We have no way 
to rid ourselves of this melancholy feeling and must therefore 
suffer in silence. When. ordering, avoid blue teachers. 
Next to blue teachers, gray teachers are the worst. They look 
upon every new student with suspicion. They seem to think we 
come to school just to cause them grief. Believing that “turn 
about is fair play,” they cause all the trouble they can, even 
when we don’t deserve it. Next to blue teachers, avoid the gray 
ones. 
Last comes the teacher the whole school loves—the white 
teacher. She requires study, but is fair in everything. She 
understands the boys and girls she has to do with. She knows 
when to overlook an unprepared lesson, and yet one cannot 
“bluff” her. She understands the mischievousness and restless- 
ness of a student and does not look upon it as meanness. She 
treats the pupil as a friend, not as some inferior being, into 
whom she is to batter, beat, and pound knowledge. If possible, 
when picking a teacher pick a white one. This is rather diffi- 
geult because of the demand, but you will find almost every school 
is fortunate in having what the whole school loves—the white 
teacher.

Wart Scuoot Men THINK or TEACHERS. 
Several studies have been made to determine the essen- 
tial characteristics and qualifications of a good teacher 
from the viewpoint of superintendents, supervisors, and 
principals. Most of these studies have been carried on 
by means of a questionnaire. One method is to discover 
the qualities of merit in teachers by making out a list of 
desirable characteristics and having school men in the 
various parts of the country rank these in order of impor- 
tance. A similar method is used to discover the important 
causes of failures among teachers.

Ruediger and Strayer’ used the following items in order 
to determine the qualities of merit in teachers: 
1. Experience in years. 
2. General teaching merit._— 
3. Health. co 
4. Personal appearance. 
5. Initiative or originality> 
6. Strength of personality. 
7. Teaching skill; method.— 
8. Control, or ability to keep order. ~~ - 
9. Ability to carry out suggestions. 
10, Accord between teacher and pupil. ~ 
11. Progressive scholarship or studiousness. 
12. Social factor outside of school. —— 
This list emphasizes five major factors: -expertence,—— 
health, professional-training, scholarship, and personality> 
The social virtues do not appear to occupy as prominent 
a place as in the study made by Engleman on pupils’ 
estimate of teachers. 
By means of a questionnaire,? one writer attempted to 
discover the type of preparation needed on the part of 
teachers. He groups the replies under five general ‘heads: 
  1. A better knowledge of subject-matter. 
2. Advanced study in the science of teaching. 
3. Experience in student teaching under close supervision. 
4, More knowledge of pupils, more sympathy with them; 
knowing how to “teach pupils instead_of subjects” ; less speciali- 
zation. 
5. More “experience” with life; a richer personality; the 
culture that comes from travel and contact with people—espe- 
cially with those outside the teaching profession. 
This list also includes three of the major factors men- 
tioned by Ruediger and Strayer—namely, scholarship, pro- 
fessionaltraining, and personality.

This table lists weakness of discipline as fourth in order of 
importance, outranked by poor instruction, weakness of 
personality, and lack of interest. 
In another report? on the study of causes of failure 
among elementary school teachers, we find “poor disci- 
pline” as the most important of ten causes of failure, 
judged from the frequency with which it was mentioned 
by superintendents in answer to the questionnaire. The 
ability to discipline is perhaps the most emphasized char- 
acteristic of a teacher. Ruediger and Strayer, in the study 
cited above, found the highest relation was between teach- 
ing skill and the ability to keep order. Buellesfield lists 
weakness in discipline as the chief cause of failure; and 
lack of judgment, deficient scholarship, and poor methods, 
in the order named. These results show beyond a reason- 
able doubt that there is a close relationship between wéak-

-P-A-G-E-20
2 8 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
‘ness of discipline and weak personality. From these 
studies we are perhaps justified in concluding that individ- 
ual efficiency in teaching depends on at least three major 
factors: personality, scholarship, and professional training. 
| TracHina PERSONALITY 
Fundamental qualities of teaching personality. Presi- 
dent McKenney, of the Michigan State Normal College, 
has admirably analyzed the fundamental qualities in the 
teacher’s personality as follows: sympathy, sincerity, jus- 
tice, dynamic knéwledge, good breeding, and id¢alism.* 
Through sympathy the teacher is able to put himself 
in the child’s place, to get his point of view and to see 
things as they really are. We all love people who are 
sympathetic and who can understand us. Sympathy 
enables the teacher to make allowance for childish igno- 
rance, thoughtlessness, and failings. Sincerity implies 
high moral standards and singleness of motive. When the 
teacher is sincere, children have no reason for suspicion 
or doubt. They have no difficulty in discovering the 
teacher who is “two-faced,” and once they “find out,” 
then that teacher’s usefulness is at an end. No teacher 
ean ever be successful in pretending to know more than 
he actually does. Justice implies a “square deal,” the 
willingness to look at all sides of the problem, to take 
into consideration all foreseeable consequences before pass- 
ing judgment. A keen sense of justice makes impossible 
snap judgments; it enables us to look before we leap. 
All normal children are very quick to respond to the ideal 
of justice, and to be the “teacher’s pet” is to be ostracized 
from child society. 
Dynamic knowledge means facts organized and closely 
related to life. It refers to ideas that “get somewhere.” 
4Quoted by Miller, L., in Hducation for the Needs of Life, page 326.

  WILLIAM CHANDLER BAGLEY 
William Chandler Bagley has made a positive 
contribution to education through his books and 
writings. He has done much toward placing 
teaching and the preparation of teaching upon 
a dignified, professional basis. He is one of 
the leading authorities on the professional 
preparation of teachers.

INDIVIDUAL EFFICIENCY IN TEACHING 9 
It is the ability to act_in new and novel situations, to do 
the right thing at the right time. The dynamic knowledge 
in the teacher arouses in the pupil a keen desire and a 
high aspiration for learning. Good breeding implies a 
keen sensitiveness to the finer things of life. Does it 
make any real difference whether a man eats with his 
knife or with his fork ; whether he raises his hat to a lady; 
whether he rises when a lady enters the room; whether 
a lady says “thank you” upon being given a seat in a 
street car? As a matter of fact, it is a sensitiveness to 
these little finer immaterial things of life, the require- 
ments of polite society, that we all admire and respect. 
Good breeding prompts the teacher to respect the rights 
of children just the same as those of adults in matters of 
social relationship. And in those inevitable contacts with 
the home of the pupil, the teacher will find that angry 
and ignorant parents and parents of ill will are more 
likely to be favorably influenced by the teacher of whose 
personality good breeding is a vital part. 
The work of the teacher is one that demands a large 
amount of idealism. It is absolutely necessary that 
teachers should develop a high code of ethics, for teaching 
touches child life at more points perhaps than does any 
other form of human activity. The wide-reaching impor- 
tance of teaching brings with it the fullest opportunity 
for service. To inspire the oncoming generation to think 
rightly and to act honorably, and to raise the level of 
thinking and living is the big job of teachers of today. 
The teacher must therefore believe that, to education “all 
things are possible.” This does not mean that he will 
“ignore individual differences or original capacities, but it 
does mean that the true teacher, filled with high idealism, 
will never give up hope that every pupil under his diree- 
tion can make some worth-while achievement, even though  
-P-A-G-E-24
  10 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
it may be relatively small and insignificant. The function 
of the teacher is not to create brains but to prevent a 
lamentable waste of them. 
Investigate the cases of teachers who have been leaders 
and inspiring examples in any school or community, and 
you will find that their reputations are the result of patient 
building with the ideal of a desire ever to deal fairly, 
liberally, and considerately. Their envied names stand 
for dependability, honor, service, and success, A real 
teacher is a leader in intellectual and moral standards. 
Whatever the inspiring teacher says or does is a beacon 
light guiding children to walk in the same path of upright- 
ness. The aims and ideals of such a one are an inspiration 
to all; and as respect for him grows, he not only increases 
his influence and service, but reaps for himself rewards 
of happiness and success. 
“ Good example must ever come from those who are 
superior in intelligence, for they are the ones who must 
take the leadership for the better things of life.) If we 
teachers conduct ourselves according to the highest ideals, 
_we necessarily inspire others to follow our example. Thus 
we influence and foster human advancement and better- 
ment. To render this kind of honorable service is to add 
to the world’s welfare and to our own happiness. 
Can personality be developed? The following list' of 
ten qualities (in order of their frequency) represents the 
composite judgment of 100 experienced school men as to 
the composition of the “teaching personality” : 
1. Sympathy. _6. “Enthusiasm. 
2. ‘Personal appearance. — 7. Scholarship. — 
3. “Address. — 8. ‘Vitality. — 
4, Sincerity. 9. » Fairness. 
5. Optimism. 10. ‘Reserve or dignity. —

In commenting on these results, Bagley says: 
The important result of this study is the evidence that it offers 
against the fatalistic notion that the important factors in the 
teacher’s personality are not improvable through the discipline 
of experience and training. There are undoubtedly some indi- 
viduals who could never improve their manner of meeting people 
(their “address’”’), and there are others perhaps who could never 
make their “personal appearance” more attractive. Still others, 
it is clear, are natural pessimists, and neither experience nor 
training nor inspiration could transform their gloom and oppres- 
sion into “optimism” and “enthusiasm.” Still others are nat- 
urally undignified and can have no commanding influence over 
their fellows. They lack “reserve” and can never create it. Some, 
too, are naturally unfair, or weak in vitality, or deficient in 
sympathy. But after all acknowledgment has been made to the 
fatalists, it must still be admitted that most individuals can 
change and improve these various qualities. Knowing what fac- 
toys “count” in a teaching personality, the beginning teacher, 
under wise supervision, may adopt measures that will work what 
might seem at the outset to be little less than a miracle of trans- 
formation.t 
There is rather clear evidence that both experience and 
training have a positive effect in improving the “teaching 
ersonality.” 
\V war of improving personality. The fundamental 
principles underlying the growth of personality may be 
summed up as follows: the desire for self-improvement, 
self-examination, focusing upon ideals, and the selection 
of a favorable environment. 
A strong desire for self-improvement is a dynamic force 
in life. Most of us are suffering from a feeling of self- 
satisfaction. We are prone to set up higher standards of 
conduct for others than we have for ourselves. Desire 
for self-improvement depends upon self-examination, as 
there will be no desire for improvement until there is

some definite consciousness of defect. This is where self- 
examination and self-criticism play the leading role. At 
more or less regular intervals we should take ourselves 
away from the “noisy world” and analyze ourselves to 
find out just why we are not accomplishing what we 
should. In our hurried and crowded lives we all need 
an occasional hour of solitude which gives us a chance, as 
it were, to stand face to face with ourselves. 
Having, then, the desire for growth, the next step is the 
discovery of our own weak points. Self-examination and 
self-criticism discover the direction in which improvement 
is desirable, but growth will not’ come through criticism 
alone. Mere criticism and fault-finding with one’s self 
may lead to nothing but discouragement. Real growth 
comes through focusing our attention upon the ideal which 
is the goal in the opposite direction of our defect. 
A favorable environment will do much for a teacher in 
developing an interest in the work and in the improvement 
of the work. A favorable environment is likewise abso- 
lutely necessary for emotional peace and the absence of 
worry. The selection of a favorable environment is always 
partly under our control, at least to the extent that we can 
almost always choose the companionship of right people and 
right books. Teachers need a broad and varied contact 
with people, especially with those outside the profession. 
Thus we see that there are at least three factors neces- 
sary for improying the teaching personality: ,the desire 
to improve, the ability to improve, and a knowledge of 
how to improve.’ No teacher is a failure through choice. 
Most teachers-have the desire and the ability to improve, 
but lack a knowledge of how to improve. Some few 
teachers have the desire, ability, and knowledge, but still 
fail to improve because of laziness, timidity, or worry. 
In discussing the general psychological factors and condi-

tions of improvement, Thorndike lists several which apply 
equally well to improving the teaching personality: inter- 
est in the work, interest in improvement, an active inquir- 
ing attitude, acceptance of the work as significant to the 
worker’s wants, the absence of irrelevant emotional excite- 
ment, and the absence of worry.’ ee 
Broap ScHousARSHIP 
Every teacher should know more than he teaches. The 
youngest pupil in kindergarten knows enough to appre- 
ciate the fact that no one should attempt to teach what 
he does not understand. Adequate scholarship for the 
preparation of teaching should go beyond the subjects to 
"be taught and take account of those subjects which are 
related to them. - This is absolutely: necessary in order 
to know what to emphasize and what to neglect in the 
subjects to be taught. For example, a rich background 
in literature, history, and related subjects is ache 
good material_in eccctae aces types of | el and 
in properly i ting them. Adequate scholarship 
makes possible a breadth of view and a keen apprecia- 
tion of the things we are doing. 
We all learn what things are by finding out what they 
mean to other people. 
    By taking heed of what others are doing, the child gains a 
mastery of the means for the expression of the capacity for 
which he is endowed by nature: the meaning of a hammer is 
understood when we grasp the purpose of the carpenter to drive 
nails; the meaning of a spade when we perceive that the soil in 
the garden is to be loosened and turned over; the meaning of * 
pencil and paper when we understand their relation to writing 
and drawing.”

  14 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
This is a fundamental principle, and its truth places a 
real responsibility upon every teacher. Geography, for 
example, will mean to the child just exactly what it means 
to the teacher, and unless the teacher has a broad knowledge 
and a keen appreciation of the subject, it will be impossible 
for the child to gain much from a study of geography. 
PROFESSIONAL TRAINING 
The third essential of good teaching is professional 
training. Professional training includes the study of the 
sciences which lie back of educational theory (psychology, 
sociology, biology) and those subjects having to do directly 
with the problems and technique of teaching. Such train- 
ing gives method a scientific foundation by a study of the 
laws of learning and the original nature of the child. 
It gives direction and power to the work of the teacher 
through knowledge of the aims and ideals of educational 
leaders in the past, of the aims of education today, and by 
providing a sound philosophy of education. Furthermore, 
through professional training, student teaching and di- 
rected observation are provided. These are based upon 
the theory that the best method of imparting the skill and 
technical knowledge needed in any vocation is the actual 
participation in the activity being learned. Through stu- 
dent teaching, pre-service teachers, under close supervi- 
sion of training teachers, come into direct contact with 
the important phases of the teaching process, and through 
directed observation they see expert teaching in many 
different subjects. The vast majority of teachers need 
professional training because it gives direction to their 
teaching, helps them master the technique of teaching, 
and gives them an instrument by which they can criticise 
their work and develop the stimulus to self-improvement.

Functions of a teacher-training institution. The fune- 
tions of a teacher-training institution are: to make it pos- 
sible for teachers and prospective teachers (1) to gain a 
thorough knowledge and appreciation of subject-matter as 
a means of interpreting life more fully; (2) to gain a 
thorough knowledge of educational biology and psychology 
that they may understand and appreciate the nature of the 
child, and the laws of learning upon which the principles 
of method are based; (3) to gain real insight into a sound 
philosophy of education which determines the educational 
ideals and aims; (4). to'understand an educational sociol- 
ogy which reveals the school as a social institution and the 
child as a vital part of the social environment; (5) to 
acquire the technique of_teaching through closely super- 
vised student teaching and directed observation; (6) to 
feel themselves as a vital and necessary part of the school 
organization through a working knowledge of the adminis- 
tration and organization of the public school system. 
Fundamental information for the teacher. There are 
certain facts and principles which teachers should know, 
regardless of whether they are in the elementary or sec- 
ondary school, whether they are supervisors, principals, or 
superintendents. Below is an attempt to list the minimum 
essentials that every teacher should master. There will 
be an overlapping among these; a certain amount is 
necessary to establish proper relationship between the 
various subjects. A certain amount of overlapping is a 
good thing, as it serves as a “warming-up” period for an 
attack on the new problem. No attempt is made to list 
these essentials in order of importance. 
1. Knowledge of the child—individual differences in . 
comprehension and speed of learning, ‘in previous training, 
in mental age, ability, interest, and sex. 
2. An intelligent conception of what the minds of the

6. The organization of public education—units of ad- 
ministration and methods of control. 
7. A knowledge of the relation of subject-matter to 
the needs of the child and the needs of society—the relat- 
ing of subject-matter to the aims and functions of 
education. 
8. The various ways of presenting subject-matter, the 
various~ types of classroom procedure—inductive and* 
deductive, object, socialized, appreciation, drill, review. 
~9. A knowledge of the problem of the control of the 
behavior and conduct of pupils in school—understanding 
of proper standards of conduct according to the age of 
pupils and school conditions; understanding of rational 
measures of discipline that are adequate to maintain the 
standards set up.

among school children, and of the methods of preventing 
and detecting them.

THE TEACHER’S PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION 
Tue NeEep ror A PHILOsoPpHY x 
Every individual has a ‘philosophy of life. He may be 
an optimist and see the bright side of life.. He may be a 
pessimist and look on the dark side of life. He may be 
too busy to think of life in terms of good or bad. He 
may judge the value of everything in terms of money. He 
may value things on the basis of the amount of happiness 
they give to others. No matter how a man thinks of life a 
and values, his thoughts constitute his philosophy. Every 
teacher has a philosophy of life and, added to this, he 
should have a definite philosophy of education. They will 
include the way he looks at life and education, and the 
terms in which he judges values. 
Every teacher should strive to have a right scale of 
values. The teacher who works for mere money, or to have 
something to do, or because he is trained to do nothing 
else has the wrong way of thinking about his work.‘ Every 
teacher should feel that education is the greatest work 
in the world. There is no other occupation that has as 
much to do with determining the future of the nation. 
-The combined efforts of the teachers can build up the 
wrong ideals in a nation, and they can also build up the 
right ideals. ‘The teacher must think about his work in) 
terms of the greatness and of the sacredness of the tas 
to be done. This must be the basis of his philosophy of

life. A teacher must also love children and see the bright 
side of life. “If he does not, the children in his care will 
not get the greatest good out of childhood. 
It is not enough for a teacher to have a right philosophy 
of life and an adequate conception of the bigness of his 
work. He must also have the right philosophy of edu- 
eation. What is education? Why should children go to 
school? What should a teacher hope to accomplish? 
What is the function of subject-matter? These are some 
of the questions that can be answered only by a teacher 
who has the right philosophy of education. 
Through the ages those interested in the training of chil- 
dren have answered the above questions in many different 
ways. Different philosophies have been developed as man’s 
attitude toward education has changed. Even at the pres- 
ent time many different philosophies of education exist. 
The private school that rests its claim for fame on the num- 
ber of its graduates that pass college entrance examina- 
tions has a philosophy of education vastly different from 
the school that counts its greatness in terms of the useful 
citizens it has produced.

John Dewey is generally considered to be America’s 
greatest educational philosopher. His teachings form the 
basis of the most advanced thought and practices in the 
best American schools today. Dewey’s philosophy is con- 
cerned with public education in a democracy. If Amer- 
ica is to continue as the world’s greatest democracy, we 
must have education that is democratic in its thinking and 
in its practices. A short explanation of Dewey’s ”~ 
losophy is here given. 
Education is life” Many educators have believed that 
the child existed for the sake of the man or the woman 
that was to be, and that education should be prep   
-P-A-G-E-35
  
THE TEACHER’S PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION 21 
for the adult life to come later. This is not true. Educa- 
tion is life. It is a continuous process from the beginning 
to the end of life both in and out of school. Dea! with the 
child each day as an individual with real problexs to 
sclve and a real life to live, and when the child reaches 
maturity he will be more able to deal with the adult prob- 
lems that will then confront him. 
Education is growth. When a child grows from what 
he is one day into what he is the next day, the great 
process of education is taking place. As long as growth 
continues, education is taking place. It is the function of 
the school and the teacher to see that this growth con- 
tinues day by day. If growth is a constant process during 
school life, then it will continue after the child leaves 
school. ‘Growth that begins in school and continues 
throughout life is the great goal of modern education. 
Reading is a good example of this. It is not enough for 
a child to learn the mechanics of reading ; he must be given 
ample opportunity to read and to enjoy good literature. 
He must form good library habits. He must learn to know 
worth-while literature. Knowing how to read is value- 
less unless a child learns what to read. If the school 
accomplishes this, the individual as an adult will continue 
to read good literature. This is true education. 
Education is a social process. Education in America 
must be education for democracy. If education is life 
and growth, then it must be life within a social group. 
It was believed at one time that education was best accom- 
plished in a quiet place where the learner was uninter- 
rupted. It may be true that learning takes place under 
such conditions, but education is much more than learn- 
ing. It is living. Schools must be democratic commu- 
nities wherein children live natural, democratic lives with 
their companions and grow into adulthood with good cit- 
izenship a part of their experience. In sharp contrast

to this method is the one which would have children learn 
the rules for good citizenship. These rules may be taught 
» in a non-democratie school by a teacher who is an auto- 
erat. The difference between the results of the two meth- 
ods is that in the first case the children, through experience, 
are good citizens, while by the second method, through 
knowledge, they merely know how to be good citizens. 
Education is the continuous reconstruction of experi- 
ence. (The activities of each day are based on past 
experience,) Every day of a child’s life is conditioned 
upon vious days. However, if education is evel, 
some new element is also added. When the new experi- 
ence is added to the old, it is all reorganized in the light 
of the new experiences. This forms a new basis for experi- 
ences to come later. The “reconstruction or reorganization 
of experience which adds to the meaning of experience, 
and which increases ability to direct the course of sub- 
sequent experience,” is, according to Dewey, education. 
The above are the essential points,of a good philosophy 
of education. If-a teacher-knows that education ip a 
present activity and not a product to be striven for, that 
it is life and growth in a social environment, he ee 
drop from his teaching many common bad practices. 
The remainder of this chapter will take up some impor 
tant educational theories in the light of Dewey’s philosophy. 
OrnEeR THEORIES OF EpucaTION 
Education as preparation. This is an old idea of edu- 
eation. In America it is closely related to the history of 
the development of our schools. The college was estab- 
lished first, and then the secondary school was established 
to prepare for the college. Later, the elementary school 
began to prepare children for the secondary school. Each

THE TEACHER’S PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION 23 
school had a set of entrance examinations, and it was 
the function of the lower to prepare pupils to pass these 
examinations for the next higher. 
The philosophy of John Dewey condemns such an idea 
of education. If education is life and growth, then a child 
does not go to school today so that he may be prepared to 
go to school tomorrow; but he goes to school today in order 
that he may live to the fullest today. 
People who believe in education as preparation not only 
think that each school is a preparation for the school 
above, but that each part of the school is a preparation for 
adult life. Children are constantly told that they must 
do this and must not do that, because they will need this 
and will not need that when they become adults. This is a 
very bad: philosophy of education. Children live proverb- 
ially in the present. It is difficult to get a young child 
to do an uninteresting task because it will help him to 
do something when he becomes an adult. 
The old idea that we should test all educational values 
by future needs results in procrastination. When a 
child is assigned a certain problem and told that he 
must accomplish it because it will help him when he grows 
up, he will naturally think that because it will be a long 
time before he is grown up, he will have a long time: to 
do the problem. However, if a real problem is assigned 
to a pupil and he sees the connection between the problem 
and his present life, he will do the problem now and not 
some time between now and adult life. When you take 
away from children the immediate appeal of work, it is 
necessary for the teacher-to~substitute-artificial means—in 
order to‘accomplish his end. Threats, bribes, and punish- 
ments are very common as a means of compelling children 
to work when the work has no meaning to them except 
preparation for adult life. 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
24 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
> 
It is not necessary to go to the opposite extreme bnd 
say that education should not prepare for adult life, but 
‘it is wrong to consider preparation for the adult life as 
the end of education. -If a child grows and lives to the 
fullest today, he will be able to live better and grow 
better tomorrow, and when he becomes an adult he will be 
prepared to live to the fullest as an adult. This is, in 
truth, preparation for the future. But the child does not 
know he is preparing for the future, and he does each 
task of each day for the joy of doing the day’s work well. 
Education as unfolding. Some educators believe that 
education is a process of unfolding. Like education as 
preparation, this theory sets a distant goal for education. 
But these educators believe that, instead of simply driving 
children forward to that goal by bribes, threats, or any 
other means invented by the ingenuity of a teacher, a child 
should unfold toward this goal. (his idea is based on the 
belief that a child innately Jhas the possibilities of develop- 
ment to a certain goal, and that it is the teacher’s business, 
\by skillful questioning and careful leading, to draw them 
out of the child. This philosophy is not as bad as the idea 
of education as ‘a preparation for adult life, but it does 
have all of the bad features of education which aims at a 
distant goal. It does not have the bad teaching practices 
which come from driving on toward this goal. It does, 
however, have bad teaching practices, because tec 
attempt to draw out from pupils things that are not there. 
Education as unfolding is not a common ‘Goctrine in 
education. However, there are a few people who still 
hold to this view. : | 
Education as formal discipline. The-doctrine of formal 
discipline teaches that subjects are not taught for their 
‘own intrinsic value, but for ‘the mechanical effect they 
have on the mind>* When a child goes to school and studies,

THE TEACHER’S PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION 25 
he does not do this primarily in order to learn, but to have 
his imagination, memory, will, and other “faculties” 
trained. This doctrine is based on the old “faculty” 
psychology. This psychology taught that the mind is made 
up of a group of separate faculties, each of which could 
be trained through exercise. A parallel was often drawn 
between the mental and the physical. The muscles of the 
arm can be trained through exercise; therefore the fiber 
of the will can be trained through exercise. The same 
thing was believed of all so-called mental faculties. 
Many subjects that are now in the curriculum of the 
publie schools are there because of their so-called disciplin- 
ary value. Every subject in the school curriculum was 
put there originally for some real purpose. For example, 
Latin and Greek were first put in for their trade value. 
But, as their trade value disappeared, they were kept in 
because they were thought to have this so-called disciplin- 
ary value. <A child is often told that if he studies Latin it 
will train his mind to do certain other pieces of mental 
work, The same value is also claimed for other subjects 
which have little practical value, and an attempt is made 
to justify them on the basis of formal discipline. 
The idea of formal discipline has been a factor in the 
educational field for many years and is still held by a 
few educators. However, the tendency of today is de- 
cidedly away from formal discipline. The present-day 
psychology does not lend itself to the ideas of formal 
discipline. Modern psychologists do not believe that the 
mind is composed of a group of faculties. The modern 
view holds that the mind is not divided into parts, but 
that it functions in various manners. When a man wills 
to do a thing, it is the whole mind that does it and not 
a “faculty” called will. A man may think, remember, 
love, and will, and it is still the same man and the same
-P-A-G-E-42
    26 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
mind that is functioning. Furthermore, experimental evi- 
dence is very much against the doctrine of formal disci- 
pline. Experiments that have been carried out in past years 
have shown quite conclusively that so-called formal dis- 
cipline does not exist. It is interesting from the teacher’s 
standpoint to think straight on this subject. Ifa teacher 
follows the philosophy of John Dewey and believes that 
education is life and growth, he cannot believe in the 
doctrine of formal discipline. He will teach his pupils so 
that they will live and grow to the fullest, and he will not 
worry about developing some mythical faculty. 
Education as recapitulation. A group of educators 
led by the late G. Stanley Hall have believed that educa- 
tion should be a living over or recapitulation of the his- 
tory of the race. This theory is known in édueation as the 
eulture-epoch theory. It finds its basis in human embryol- 
ogy. These psychologists believe that the individual lives 
over again the history of the race from the time the cells 
unite to form the individual until the end of the period of 
childhood. Various studies have been made which tend 
to show that the human infant passes through these stages 
of race development before birth. This may or may not 
be true. For those interested in education it is not of 
particular importance to know whether it is true or not. 
Educators are interested only in the conscious, living, 
breathing child after birth. 
The believer in this theory would study race_history 
and pattern the education of the childafter the develop- 
ment of the race. There are many objections to this belief 
in education. In the first place, it leads_backward-instead 
of forward in the search for subject-matter and methods. 
Furthermore, according to this theory it is not necessary 
to study the individual child. It is necessary only to study > 
the history of the race if we wish to know what educa-

iomtih child should be given. Finally, the culture-epoch 
theory neglects to take into account the short-ceuts of 
nature, It is not necessary for the child to go through all 
the stages of development of the race, because the indi- 
vidual can find many valuable short-cuts to the same mate- 
rial. Most of the leading psychologists and philosophers 
of the day are much opposed to the culture-epoch theory. 
The teacher will get many more hints as to the education 
of children by studying children and their daily needs 
than he can from attempting to study the remote history 
of the race. 
Education as acquiring knowledge. To the believers 
in the “education as acquiring knowledge” theory, to be 
educated is only to know. The educated man ofthe past 
might shut himself away from his fellowman and live a 
nion-social life so long as he was gaining more knowledge. 
Today the emphasis of education is not on knowing, but 
on doing. | According to Dewey’s idea of education, a 
man may know everything there is to know in the world 
and still not be educated. It is true that knowledge is a 
necessary part of education. Man does his work in life 
better if he has command of certain facts. But the true 
aim is knowledge for the sake of doing and not for the sake 
of knowing. ‘ 
If knowledge is the primary aim of education, then 
subject-matter becomes supreme. It matters not how a 
teacher teaches children so long as they get the necessary 
knowledge. Punishment, bribing, and other forms of 
inducing children to study are very common with teachers 
who believe that knowledge is the end of education. 
Knowledge is still supreme in those secondary schools 
whose chief function is to prepare students for college. 
The element that is stressed during the whole four years of 
work in these schools is the knowledge that will be neces-

sary to pass an entrance examination. Such a school is 
not educating children, but is hindering the natural process 
of life and growth. 
Motivation in education. Why does a child study? 
Why does he learn to read and write? How ean a teacher 
get her children to learn the multiplication tables? The 
child must have some motive. It has been suggested that 
when the goal is in the distance and when knowledge is 
the end of education, punishment, bribes, prizes, and other 
external stimuli are often given to the children in order 
to urge them on to do good work. There has grown up 
in education an idea which is called “motivation,” which 
means that the child is given a motive for doing the neces- 
sary school work. Is motivation a good or a bad thing in 
education? The answer depends on how motivation is 
used. When the motive is external to the activity, motiva- 
tion is bad. If a teacher wishes to have her children do a 
certain piece of work and offers them prizes for doing it, 
the motivation is bad. An example of this might be the 
giving of a prize for learning the multiplication tables or 
learning to spell long lists of words. ' Prizes of all kinds 
are examples of false motives. 
Good motivation obtains when the motive for doing the 
act lies within the act. In the case of writing, a child 
may wish to learn to write so that he may send a letter to 
his mother. He will practice his writing then because it 
has an intrinsic value to him. This idea, of course, moti- 
vates the learning. This is an example of good motivation. 
In every case, whether in school or out, it is easy to decide 
whether a motive is good or not. If the motive is within 
the act and if satisfaction is the natural result of the act, 
it is a good motive. If the motive is something that is 
external to the act and is offered to the child in order 
to get him to do the act, then the motive is bad.

Subject-matter and method. There has been much 
discussion in education as to the relative values of subject- 
matter and method. Such a discussion will do very little 
good, because no school is_possible-without both’ subject- 
matter and method. In the old schools subject-matter was 
supreme. This was particularly true when education was 
thought of as preparation for college or when knowledge 
was the end in education. When education and life are 
synonymous, when the process of education is conceived 
of as a process of growth and development, method has a 
much more important place. Method, at the present time, 
holds a more important place than subject-matter. It will 
always be necessary to have subject-matter in the schools, 
and this subject-matter should be presented by_the best 
method in order that children may live and grow to the 
fullest. 
Logical versus psychological. Another discussion com- 
mon in the educational field is that of the psychological 
versus the logical method of presenting subject-matter to 
children. ‘The old school favored the logical method, while 
the newer school favors the psychological method. A good 
example may be taken from geography. If geography is 
taught logically, the child first learns that the world is a 
sphere and that it is made up of continents and oceans. 
He then learns the names of the continents and oceans and 
later divides the continents, learning the names of the 
various countries. By this process of logical division he 
will finally arrive at the smallest division of the country, 
and the last thing to be studied will be home geography. 
The psychological method is just the opposite. It is 
also in harmony with the philosophy of education which 
has been explained in this chapter. If education is life, 
then geography should start where children have life con- 
tacts with geographical material. This, of course, will be

at home. Geography that is taught by the psychological 
method will start with the home surroundings and gradu- 
ally, through relationships, move to the state and to other 
parts of the country. It is always best to start a new piece 
of work by finding out the present contact the children 
have with the field. This helps to make the work more 
real and life-like. 
ENVIRONMENT OF EDUCATION 
Environment is an important factor in all life. Whether 
it be plant or animal life, the type and the amount of 
growth are dependent upon environment. When we con- 
ceive of education as life, environment becomes a very 
important factor in education. As long as education is 
conceived of as knowledge-getting, environment has noth- 
ing to do with the process. But, as soon as an education is 
conceived of as living and growing, the environment be- 
comes the greatest single factor. 
In America, where children live in a democracy, if they 
are to know how to live, we should surround them with a 
democratic environment in the schoolroom. No matter 
what we wish to have children become or accomplish, we 
ean do ‘the things best by controlling the environment of 
the child. Take music for example. Under the old ideas of 
education the child learned names of composers and dates 
of compositions and learned to recognize by memory cer- 
tain compositions when they were heard. In all of this, 
knowledge was the chief aim, and environment had very 
little value. But appreciation of good musie should be an 
important factor in the life of the child. In the elemen- 
tary schools an attempt is made to develop in the child 
a love for good music and an ability to sing many simple 
songs. From the standpoint of environment, this is aecom- 
plished today by surrounding the child with good music
-P-A-G-E-47

and giving him ample opportunity to sing good cong ey 
‘The same thing is true with art. Today the child is sur- Poe “Ss 
rounded by beautiful pictures and artistic surroundings 
in order to develop his appreciation. Environment is a 
better teacher than books. 
Questions and Problems 
1. Why is it important that the teacher have the right way 
of thinking about her work? 
2. Why is education so necessary in a democracy? 
3. What, according to Dewey, are the important factors of 
education? ., 
4. What harm may result from teaching children the rules 
for citizenship? 
5. What are the bad teaching practices that result from the 
belief in education as unfolding? 
6. What are the shortcomings of formal discipline as an 
educational guide? 
7. How may. one determine whether motivation is good or 
bad? 
8. Make a list of examples of good motivation. 
9. What is the relation between subject-matter and method? 
10. Give examples to show the logical and psychological 
method of presenting subject-matter.

matter of learning facts. Teaching reading, writing, and 
arithmetic is a small part of the work of the teacher. The 
“sehool should serve every member of the community, and 
its influence should be felt every day of the year. (hite

training cannot be done in an ordinary class with a book. 
‘Pupils must be good citizens in school in order to be good

old “birch rod” method does not train for citizenship. A 
school gives this training only when the children have a

PREAMBLE 
We, the pupils of Maria Mitchell School, in order to make 
Maria Mitchell a better school and to make our pupils better 
citizens and to enable them to take intelligent part in ecommu- 
nity life, do ordain and establish this constitution for the Maria 
Mitchell School. 
CONSTITUTION 
Article I 
LEGISLATIVE POWER 
Section 1 
The Legislative power shall be vested in a Congress which 
shall consist of two eighth grades and two representatives from 
the Seven A grade. 
Section 2 
The Congress shall meet regularly Wednesday or Friday 
afternoon of each week. 
Section 3 
A person is entitled to hold not more than one office at a time. 
Section 4 
Each Congressman is entitled to one vote only. 
  
1The material for this discussion was very kindly furnished by Mrs. Mar- 
garet Mendenhall Smith, principal of the Mitchell School.

Section 5 
Any law passed by Congress cannot go into effect until it bears 
the President’s signature. If vetoed by him, it shall go back to 
the Congress where it must have a two-thirds majority of votes 
to pass over the President’s veto. 
Section 6 
Clause a. The Congress shall have power to plan entertain- 
ments for the Seventh and Highth grades of the Maria Mitchell 
School. 
Clause b. The Congress shall have power to levy and collect 
all fines in the Seventh and Highth grades. 
Section 7 
The Vice-president shall have power to appoint: two standing 
committees—a committee of finance and a committee of ways and 
means, each committee to consist of three members. 
Section 8 
The “Eight A” pupils of the school shall be known as the 
Senators and the “Hight B” pupils shall be known as the Repre- 
sentatives. 
Article II deals with executive powers; Article III, 
judicial powers; Article IV, bills and resolutions; Article 
V, general provisions; Article VI, revenue; and Article 
VII, ratifications and amendments. 
This constitution forms the basis for some very efficient 
training in good citizenship. The children discuss and leg- 
islate on problems of interest to students. Many schools 
have set up legislative bodies which have failed because 
they have discussed problems of interest to adults and of 
no immediate concern to the pupils. A seventh grade 
“Senate” discussing the popular election of United States 
senators has no real problem to solve. But the same group 
discussing means of fire protection in the school building 
has a real problem.

Section 1. That milk be provided for the Maria Mitchell 
School. 
Section 2. That this milk be taken care of by the Domestic 
Science teacher assisted by the pupils. 
Section 3. That this milk be paid for by the pupils. 
Section 4. (Emergency clause, Section 4.) 
In the opinion of Congress an emergency exists, and this bill 
shall go into effect immediately after its passage. 
The Committee of Ways and Means approves this bill and 
recommends its passage.

The Mitchell School has become a vital part of its com- 
munity in Denver. The school is filled with life problems. 
The parents come in great numbers when anything of 
special interest is offered. The children live natural lives, 
they attract the community to the school, and the training 
they get makes them better citizens. 
Tue TEACHER AND THE COMMUNITY 
When a teacher is employed in a public school, he should 
become a vital element in the life of the community. Many 
teachers, in the past, have maintained a different point of 
view. They have held themselves aloof from the political, 
religious, and social life of the community. They believed 
that this aloofness added dignity to their position and
-P-A-G-E-53
  
TEACHER, SCHOOL, AND COMMUNITY 37 
value to their work. School officials are not looking for 
this type of teacher today. Such a teacher does not by 
this attitude add to his usefulness, but rather detracts from 
his value. The best teachers of today enter heartily into 
the-activities-ofthe community in which they serve. 
In the early days of the American public schools the 
teacher “boarded ’round.” He lived for a time with one 
family and then with another until he had lived with the 
parents of all children_in school. If a family had two 
children the teacher stayed twice as long with them as 
with a family that had but one child in school. The teacher 
was compelled to put up with very bad conditions, but he 
became very well acquainted with the parents in the 
district. 
The aloofness later assumed by some teachers was a 
natural reaction against ‘‘boarding ’round.” Of course, 
a teacher should not be compelled to live with the parents 
of the children he teaches. However, he can and should 
become a vital element in the life of his community by liy- 
ing in that community and being a good citizen. He should 
be interested in all good causes and active in their support. 
The teachers of America have contributed much toward 
clean politics and the advancement of righteousness in 
political and social life. A teacher must consider himself 
a part of every worth-while-undertaking-in-the-commu- 
nity. This is but doing what every wide-awake, live citizen 
should do. But this is not all. A teacher who teaches 
during the regular school day and lives the life of a 
progressive citizen may still miss many opportunities for 
bringing the school and the community closer together. 
He must be actively engaged in some school-community 
codperative enterprise. The successful school system of 
today must give as much attention to these activities as to 
the teaching of the three R’s.

  33 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
We hear much these days about “selling” the schools to 
the community. This is a poor expression and may give a 
wrong impression of what is meant. In the best sense it 
means bringing the schcols and community into closer 
touch by telling the community about the schools, and by 
bringing the schools into the homes. This can be best done 
through some of the organizations and methods given be- 
low. Every organization that has real value and that 
causes the schools’ and the homes to come closer together 
should be encouraged. 
There are a great many organizations that help to accom- 
plish the purpose set forth. It is possible to mention only 
the most important in this chapter. 
CHANNELS OF ScHooL-CommuNITy AcTIvITY 
The Parent-Teacher Association. The greatest organiza- 
tion for bringing the parents and the teachers into closer 
touch is the Parent-Teacher Association. No school should 
be without its P. T. A. When parents and teachers come 
together at regular intervals and have a professional and 
social hour together, much good results. The P. T. A. not 
only brings the schools and the community closer together, 
but it helps to better school conditions. If a school system 
wishes to start a health crusade, get better salaries for 
teachers, or do anything to improve the schools, the P. T. A. 
is of great assistance. Every good cause which will help 
the schools is backed by this organization. In the city of 
Denver the campaign that has been carried on in recent 
years to renovate the schools, build better buildings, and 
raise the salaries of the teachers was backed at every step 
by a very efficient Parent-Teacher Association. <A local 
association must not become purely social or purely profes- 
sional. The organization that maintains a balance between 
the two with both elements present at every meeting pros-

pers best. The teachers must always participate fully in 
the activities of the P. T. A. If the teachers lose interest 
and drop out, the parents may also lose interest, and the 
organization becomes ineffective. 
The visiting teacher. The compulsory attendance laws 
afford an excellent means for codperation between the 
teachers and the parents. These laws are often the basis 
of trouble because they are not wisely administered. Every 
state has some sort of compulsory school attendance law. 
Where there is such a law, means must be provided for its 
enforcement. In the past these laws have been enforced in 
most states by the city police departments, and. even where 
special attendance officers have been appointed by the 
school system, they have been made special members of the 
police force. The idea is an old one. Compulsory attend- 
ance is a matter of law. A child who is not attending 
school is breaking a law, and the best way to deal with 
such a case is to send an officer of the law after the child. 
By this means he may be frightened into going to school, 
or pressure may be brought to bear on his parents by 
bringing them into court and fining them. 
But this method has little to recommend it. Today, pro- 
gressive school systems have replaced the police or attend- 
ance officer with a visiting teacher. If a child is not in 
school, instead of sending an officer of the law after him, a 
sympathetic member of the teaching staff is sent to the 
home to inquire concerning the cause. Many times she 
discovers that the parents—did-not know of the child’s 
absence. If an officer of the law goes to a home he arouses 
opposition. If a visiting teacher who knows her work goes 
to the home, she immediately makes a bond between the 
home and the school, and together they solve the problem. 
In the future, the enforcing of the compulsory attendance 
law in that home is much easier, and the schools have

won a friend. A school that handles its attendance work 
in this manner is “selling” the schools to the community. 
Americanization of foreign-born. The school that con- 
fines its efforts to the children of legal school age, during 
regular school hours, misses a great opportunity for serv- 
ice in the community. This is particularly true of schools 
that are located in foreign districts of the city or country. 
Large numbers of immigrants come to America and settle 
in groups where it is possible for them to maintain their 
old language and customs. The children of these parents 
come to the American public school. Here they are taught 
the English language and the habits, customs, and ideals 
of the American people. However, the task is made very 
difficult by parents who do not understand American ideals 
or the American schools. A child of foreign parents who 
has five hours in the American schools and the remainder 
of the time at home with the language, habits, and ideals 
of a foreign country finds it difficult to become a real 
American citizen. The only possible solution of the prob- 
lem is to bring these parents into the schools and Ameri- 
canize them. 
The mothers can be formed into a Mothers’ Chib with 
afternoon meetings. This has been _done-successfully in 
many cities. At these meetings they can be taught much 
about the American way of doing things. The fathers 
and mothers can both be brought into night classes. In 
these classes they can be taught to speak and read English. 
They can also be taught American government and Ameri- 
ean ideals. Night schools may also teach trades and pre- 
pare the adult students to hold better positions. In com- 
menting on the work done in Denver the “School Review,” 
official paper of the Denver schools, said: 
The attempt is made at all these centers to make these people 
feel thoroughly at home. Either by the adjacent school and 
 
-P-A-G-E-57

community organization, or by patriotic societie# entertaining 
programs are given, the purpose of such, of course, being to 
increase knowledge of the land about to become theirs, and to 
secure confidence on their part that they will be cordially helped 
in their every effort to meet fully the requirements of the 
naturalization law. 
The great value in the work explained above is not that 
the foreign born are taught to read and write English. It 
is that they are made to appreciate the public schools, and 
to understand something about America. The children of 
school age learn not only the ordinary school subjects, but 
in many schools are taught how to live. The Webster 
School in Denver, made up of southern Italians, does this 
type of work. <A part of this school’s equipment is a small, 
fully furnished apartment. Every boy and girl in this 
school is given a thorough course in home training. This 
school has a wonderful influence on the children, and 
through the children it reaches every home in the com- 
munity. 
Playgrounds. In the ordinary school the child is free 
from his work about 3:00 or 3:45 in the afternoon. The 
present tendency is to Iéngthen the school day and vary the 
school program, giving one or more_play periods-during 
the day. , However, in most schools the children are free 
, from’ school several hours each day. In good neighbor- 
hoods no thought need be taken of this time, because the 
children are properly cared for at home. In many other 
districts the children have no place to go. The number of 
families where both parents work is increasing rapidly. 
In some city school districts the number has reached as 
high as 50 per cent. Most of these children spend the 
after-school time on the street learnjng habits that are 
bad and doing much to overcome the good influence of the 
school. These children should be provided with play- 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  42 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
grounds by the school. These grounds, if well equipped 
and properly supervised, may do a world of good in the 
type of community just described. This work belongs to 
the school. No other agency is prepared to handle it ade- 
quately. The school that does not assume this responsibility 
is shirking its duty. The teacher who thinks that respon- 
sibility ceases at 3:15 will never be a true teacher. 
Community centers. The school building should be the 
heart of every community. It is the most logical commu- 
nity center. It is the property of all the people and should 
be used by all the people. 
Many other organizations have attempted to build up 
community centers. The community-church movement is 
admirable, but at best can only bring together those of one 
religious faith. The grange in the country and many like 
organizations in the cities attempt to bring communities 
together. They have done much, but only for those who 
choose to become members. In the public schools it is pos- 
sible to bring together all people regardless of age, sex, or 
religious belief. 
The school building should be open and busy evenings as 
well as during the day. Some schools have swimming 
pools, gymnasiums, libraries, and club rooms. These should 
be as free and open to the public at night as they are to 
the children during the day. Edueation is not a product 
but a process. Education should be a continuous process 
that goes on as long as life lasts. If this is true, and if 
the function of the school is to educate, then the school 
should appeal to all of the people of the community. The 
school should have something to offer to every man, woman, 
and child that will help each of them to make the most 
of life. The open school for everybody is the ideal toward 
which all teachers should strive.
-P-A-G-E-59
  TEACHER, SCHOOL, AND COMMUNITY 43 
School exhibits. All parents are interested in the doings 
of their children. A display of the work done by the chil- 
dren in manual training, art, domestic science, writing, etc., 
never fails to attract interest. Some school systems have 
“school fairs” where the children demonstrate work of all 
kinds. Other schools have exhibits at the county fairs held 
in their own town or in a neighboring town. These are of 
value if a large number of patrons attend the fair, and if 
a conspicuous place is given over to the exhibits. In some 
fairs the school exhibits are given a very small and incon- 
spicuous place. It is better to have no display than to 
have one that compares unfavorably with others. Exhibits 
held at the schoolhouse are of great value because they bring 
the parents to the schools. 
In a number of schools, Evansville, Indiana, Syracuse, 
New York, New Trier Township High School, Kenilworth, 
Illinois, and others, the following scheme has been carried 
out with highly satisfactory results: The school program 
was so arranged that the morning session began at two 
o’clock in the afternoon and lasted until approximately 
dinner time; the afternoon session began at eight o’clock 
in the evening. Parents were urged to attend, with most 
gratifying results, the hours being particularly convenient 
for the fathers. 
There is one danger in exhibits and fairs. Children 
should not strive consciously to prepare one good specimen 
of work for this purpose. The specimens shown should 
be selected from their regular work. 
School clubs. Production clubs are of special value in 
school life. Most of these are run in connection with the 
agriculture department for the boys and the home econom- 
ies department for the girls. Probably the most valuable 
for the boys are the clubs that work with baby beef, poul-

try, corn, or pigs. In each of these organizations the mem- 
bers do the actual work involved, acting under the advice 
of a county club leader, or of the agriculture teacher. 
Meetings are held regularly and matters pertaining to 
their problems are discussed. This work is of real educa- 
tional value to pupils. It also interests the parents in the 
work of the school. 
Girls are most interested in canning clubs, although many 
girls belong to clubs that specialize in needlework, poultry, 
and gardens. The girl who does a scientific piece of can- 
ning in school is not only learning something useful, but 
she may be the means of teaching her mother better meth- 
ods of canning. It is not necessary for the teacher to 
know all the details of organizing and conducting these 
clubs. In most parts of the United States the teacher 
will find county club leaders who are paid to build up 
these organizations for the schools. If there is no leader, 
the teacher can get the necessary information from the 
State Agriculture College, or the State Department of 
Education. 
There are also many non-production clubs that are of 
value. Some are formed in connection with special sub- 
jects like art, music, or history. In addition to these there 
are many valuable organizations of a more general nature 
like debating clubs, current event clubs, literary societies, 
and class organizations. All such groups are of value only 
when they are under the very careful supervision of the 
teacher in charge. 
Boy Scouts. From the standpoint of educational value, 
one of the best organizations for boys is the Boy Scouts. 
Dean James E. Russell, Teachers College, Columbia, has 
said, “I regard the Scout Movement as one of the most 
valuable educational agencies of this generation.” 
P. P. Claxton, former United States Commissioner of
-P-A-G-E-61
  TEACHER, SCHOOL, AND COMMUNITY 45 
Education, emphasized the educational value of the Boy 
Scouts, as follows: 
Years of experience and steadily increasing accomplishments 
have tested and demonstrated the value of the work of the Boy 
Scouts of America for boys of the early adolescent period coy- 
ered by the junior high school, and I commend to the teachers, 
principals, and directors of schools of this grade their program 
as a most effective supplementary agency for strengthening the 
work of the schools. 
In reporting favorably regarding the granting of a 
charter to the organization, the House Judiciary Commit- 
tee paid this tribute to the worth of Boy Scout work: 
The Boy Scout movement is intended to supplement and enlarge 
established modern educational facilities in activities in the great 
and healthful out of doors, where may be the better developed 
physical strength and endurance, self-reliance, and the powers of 
initiative and resourcefulness, all for the purpose of establishing 
through the boys of today the very highest type of American 
citizenship. 
It tends to conserve the moral, intellectual, and physical life of 
the coming generation, and in its immediate results does much to 
reduce the problem of juvenile delinquency in the cities. 
No young man should go into the teaching profession 
without knowing how to organize and conduct a-Boy-Scout 
troop. Every normal boy is fascinated by the scout pro- 
gram. The moral value to the boy who learns to do a 
good turn daily and not to accept pay for it is very great. 
The health and cleanliness lessons in body and mind are 
invaluable. Scout ideals fill the boy with the desire to be 
areal man. No man is more idolized by boys than a suc- 
cessful scoutmaster. 
Scout troops should always be tied up with the schools. 
A church scout troop does a great work, but it brings 
together only boys of one religious faith. A public-school 
scout troop. with boys of all churches belonging is more 
educational. Furthermore, the scout program brings the
-P-A-G-E-62
46 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
school closer to the parents. If a boy’s teacher or princi- 
pal is a scoutmaster and if the schoolhouse is the scout 
meeting place, it adds interest to the school. 
Camp Fire Girls and Girl Scouts. What the Boy Scout 
program does for the boys, the program of the Girl Seouts 
and the Camp Fire Girls does for the girls. All of the 
claims made for the scout work for boys ean as logically be 
made for the work of these two organizations. The teacher 
must see in these movements a wonderful means of getting 
into closer touch with the adolescent girl and her parents. 
The Camp: Fire Girls’ camps and the Girl Scout troops 
should be run in connection with the public schools in 
order to be of greatest value both to the girls and to the 
schools. No young woman teacher can afford to start 
teaching girls of this age without knowing how to organize 
and carry on this kind of work. The educational possibili- 
ties of these movements are very great. 
School athletics. School athletics may become a great 
good or do a great harm to a school from the standpoint 
of interesting the community in the schools. School ath- 
letics have been severely criticised during the past few 
years. Many parents believe that they are stressed too 
much. When a schoolboy can talk of nothing but the 
team, the parents get a wrong conception of the schools. 
On the other hand, there is nothing easier than getting a 
community interested in a school team. Where everything 
else fails as a means of bringing parents to the schoolhouse, 
the basketball team will do it. 
From the standpoint of physical exercise it is best to have 
games that all the children can play, but from the stand- 
point of community interest, an inter-school game is more 
valuable. The wise school is the one that gives every child 
a chance to participate in games, but at the same time has 
a team made up of the best to represent the school. If 
properly handled by a wise group of teachers school ath-
-P-A-G-E-63
TEACHER, SCHOOL, AND COMMUNITY 47 
letics will win many friends for the schools and make no 
enemies. Contests, particularly in the track events, even 
between one-room country schools, always attract interest. 
Games between elementary schools as well as between high 
schools attract a large interest in the city system, and 
help to build up a pride and a spirit of loyalty that are 
most beneficial. 
School papers. If your school has a printing room, as 
many schools now have, the task of publishing a school 
paper is made easier. Where there is no printing press, 
children make successful papers even when they must be 
typed or written out with pen and ink. When the paper is 
typed or written out, it is necessary to have a limited edi- 
tion, and the children take turns in carrying a copy home. 
Many schools have had great success with such a paper. 
The children love to make a newspaper better than any- 
thing else. It affords almost limitless possibilities for cor- 
relation with the regular school work. The paper when 
made by the children should not be used as a propaganda 
sheet. It functions best when it is written entirely by the 
children and is merely a happy means of interesting the 
parents in the schools. 
School savings. The schools took on many extra fune- 
tions during the World War. Many who had not been in- 
terested in the schools suddenly became interested because 
of the large number of things they were doing with such 
great success. The school gardens, school savings, and 
Red Cross work were a few of the things that the schools 
were doing for the community. Since the war ended the 
schools have dropped ‘many of the functions that they 
assumed at that time. One that has not been dropped en- 
tirely and should not be dropped is the school savings. 
Americans are very much in need of thrift lessons. The 
thrift of the war period has largely passed away. Good 
work can be done with the children, and through the chil-
-P-A-G-E-64
  48 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
dren the parents may be reached. Probably the plan for 
school savings is the best agency for teaching thrift. In 
hundreds of schools a certain part of one day each week is 
set aside for the purpose of banking. The children bring 
their money, as small an amount as they wish, and deposit 
it in the bank. It is not necessary for the school to be 
responsible for the money; it should be handled through 
local banks. The child learns thrift, but the school is also 
interested in the fact that these savings form one more 
connecting link, and a good one, between the schools and 
the parents. A certain Ohio city recently claimed 30,000 
savings accounts among its 33,000 school children. 
Special activities. The schools must always be ready 
to codperate with other institutions of the community when 
it is for the good of the community. There are many 
special weeks set aside for various purposes that the schools 
can use in getting close to the community. Most sections 
of the country have an annual Clean-up, Paint-up Week. 
The schools should enter into such a week wholeheartedly. 
If the community wishes to clean up its dirty places and 
paint up its dark spots, the children must necessarily have 
an important part. This not only helps to teach cleanliness 
and sanitation to the children, but attracts favorable atten- 
tion to the schools. 
American Education Week is observed every year. At 
this time the newspapers devote much space to educational 
matters, and the parents are easily interested. No school 
should fail to take advantage of this national week, but 
should plan proper exercises to which the parents of the 
community are invited. 
Music Week is being celebrated in many cities and is 
possible in any part of the country. During this week 
every effort is made to reach all members of the commu- 
nity with songs and instrumental music. This is a won- 
derful opportunity for the schools to make themselves felt.
-P-A-G-E-65
TEACHER, SCHOOL, AND COMMUNITY 49 
The school orchestra, the school band, and the school 
choruses, which are possible even in elementary schools, 
not only get a valuable training for Music Week, but they 
help very much in interesting the public in the musie work 
of the public schools. 
Questions and Problems 
1. How may compulsory attendance laws become a means 
for codperation between the school and the home? 
2. What is the relation of the school to the Americanization 
of the foreign-born? 
3. How may the playground become a means of bridging 
the gap between the school and the home? 
4. How may the school building be made the community 
center? f 
5. Give examples showing how the school and the commu- 
nity may be brought into closer reiation by each of the follow- 
ing: school exhibits, school clubs, Boy Scouts, Camp Fire Girls 
and Girl Scouts, the Parent-Teachers Association, school ath- 
leties, the school paper, and school savings. 
6. List all the special or extra-curricular activities you ean 
in which the school may codperate for the good of the com- 
munity.

SUMMARY OF PART ONE 
Part One has been a description of the teacher from the 
standpoint of his efficiency, his philosophy, and his rela- 
tion to the school and the community. 
In Chapter I those elements that make for individual 
efficiency in teaching were discussed. Many studies were 
reviewed showing the causes of success and failure of 
teachers. From these studies certain elements that make 
for suecess and failure were discovered. It was shown 
first of all that a teacher must have personality. But this 
is not enough. He must also have broad scholarship and 
a thorough. professional training. No young man or woman 
should hope to be successful in the schoolroom who does 
not possess all three. Through earnest study, careful self- 
analysis, and an active effort to improve, these three funda- 
mental qualities may be made a part of any individual’s 
equipment. 
Chapter II explained how every teacher, whether he 
realizes it or not, has a philosophy of life, and it empha- 
sized that, in addition, he must have a clear-cut, up-to-date, 
sound philosophy of education, for without this he cannot 
effectively select and present subject-matter. Many inade- 
quate theories of education were explained and their falla- 
cies pointed out. As a reasonable and sound guide for the 
teacher this philosophy was presented : education is life and 
growth, and it takes place in a social environment. It is a 
present activity of the child and not some far-off, future 
result. If the child grows and lives to the fullest today, he 
will, when he becomes an adult, be prepared to live to the 
fullest as an adult.

52 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
vIn Chapter III the teacher was discussed in his rela- 
tion to his community. A teacher must not only have the 
qualities that make for suecess and have a right philosophy 
of education, but he must see his job as it is related to the 
people in the midst of whom he is working. He must learn 
that classroom work is but a part of his total function as a 
teacher. He must be prepared to utilize every activity of 
the child’s life—both in school and out—toward the great 
end of educating the child, and he must be ready and will- 
ing to help spread the influence of the school out into every 
channel and corner’ of the community life. 
Every teacher must be a leader. A teacher who cannot 
lead the boys and girls in his room and the parents in 
his community falls short of the ideal. The real teacher 
not only does his work well in the classroom, but he has the 
parents and the others living in his community as his 
friends and codperators. The real school is the heart of 
the community. The problem of compulsory attendance 
and truancy is solved by a properly organized school 
manned by efficient teachers. 
But the teacher is only one of the important factors. The 
child is also a major factor, and what the teacher under- 
stands concerning the child determines to a large extent his 
aim of education. The teacher, to be successful, must be 
familiar with the original nature of the child. He must 
also know the laws of learning and how the body should be 
eared for. These problems will be dealt with in Part Two.

CHAPTER IV 
THE ORIGINAL NATURE OF THE CHILD 
INstINcTS AND CAPACITIES 
Nature provides the new-born child with a great wealth 
of possibilities. Not only the physical body with its pos- 
sibilities of growth, but the mind with its tendencies to 
develop in certain ways is a part of this inheritance. 
When the cells unite to form an individual, much of what 
that individual may become physically and mentally, is 
determined. Of course, the physical and mental possi- 
bilities of no child will ever be fully realized unless they 
are given the proper environment and a chance to develop. 
All children come into-the world with certain tendencies 
to act, think, and feel, that. are common to the race. 
These unlearned tendencies that are common to all chil- 
dren are known as instincts. However, children differ 
widely in their possibilities. The original possibilities of 
a child that make him different from other children are 
known as capacities. ) 
All young children are attracted by bright lights, loud 
noises, and sharp contrasts. These reactions, being in- 
herited and common to the race, are instinctive. On the 
other hand, some children learn music readily and become 
musicians. Other children never succeed in music. Musi- 
cal talent is inheritéd but not common to the race; hence 
it is a capacity. Capacities represent the great possibili- 
ties of children that may develop if given the opportu- 
85  
-P-A-G-E-72
  56 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
nity. It is the purpose of this chapter to discuss instincts 
only, and not to go into the subject of capacities. 
It is not easy to determine which activities are inborn 
and which are acquired, because the learning process 
begins at a very early age. This is one of the reasons 
why it is difficult to compile a list of the instincts of chil- 
dren. Many psychologists have made such lists. How- 
ever, no two of these lists agree. Besides the difficulty 
of determining which acts are instinctive, we find it very 
difficult to name the activity in a manner satisfactory 
to all, even though we are sure it is instinctive. The 
difficulty of comparing lists made by different psychologists 
is largely due to inability to agree on terminology. 
In the following explanation of a few of the most 
important instincts no attempt is made to give them in 
the order of importance. 
Tue Important INstTINcTS 
Sensitivity. Children are sensitive to many elements in 
their environment. / This means that certain physical con- 
ditions surrounding them make an impression on their 
consciousness. All normal children are sensitive to the 
light waves that enter the eye and stimulate the sense of 
sight. They are also sensitive to certain air waves that 
cause the sensation of sound when entering the ear. 
They are sensitive to a certain range of temperature, to 
pressures on the skin, to pain, smells, tastes, and various 
other elements. This instinct of sensitivity is basic to all 
life and learning. 
Attention. ) Children are so constituted that they in- 
stinctively give attention to bright objects, sharp noises, 
pain, human faces, moving objects, and anything that 
involves a sharp contrast, like cold after heat, There are 
many sensory things that children are not attentive to, as 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  
  ORIGINAL NATURE OF THE CHILD 57 
small changes in temperature, the gradual intrusion of a 
new smell into an atmosphere, or the gradual change of 
any external condition that is stimulating the sense or- 
gans. The more gradual the change the less apt the stimu- 
lus is to attract the attention of the child. 
By means of a knowledge of these facts, the teacher is 
aided in getting the attention of a child. But it is much 
more important for the teacher to be able to hold the 
attention after it\has been sécured. 
Gross bodily control. Thorndike lists the following as 
bodily activities which he believes to be instinctive: “Sit- 
ting, standing, walking, running, stooping, jumping up, 
jumping down, leaping at, crouching, lying down, rolling 
over, climbing, dodging, stooping to pick up, raising one- 
self again, balancing, clinging, pushing with arms and 
with legs, pulling with arms.”? 
There has been some question as to just how far the 
gross bodily activities are instinctive, but for our pur- 
pose we will assume that these bodily activities which 
are common to primates in general, as well as to man, are 
instinctive. It is best for the teacher thus to assume 
them, and to act accordingly. If/they are instinctive the 
teacher must so make his program and so plan his day as 
to give the children a chance to give these natural ten- 
dencies a chance to come into play. The old-fashioned 
school, where silence and quietness were the most sought 
for virtues, violated this basie principle, which demands 
that children be given an opportunity to exercise these 
instinctive desires. 
Manipulation. The term manipulation designates the 
instinctive behavior that is sometimes described as con- 
struction and destruction. Manipulation of things, whether 
it is a matter of building or tearing down, is instinctive to 
  
1Educational Psychology, Vol. 1, page 47. *  
-P-A-G-E-74
  
58 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
every child. This instinct can be of great value to the 
child as well as to the teacher if properly directed. When 
the child has some real manipulating to do, it is not neces- 
sary for him to tear down A mere destructiveness. The 
provision of materials in the lower grade rooms and of 
tools in the upper grades gives a child a chance to develop 
this very important asset. 
Fear. There is also a group of instincts intimately 
associated with fear. It is impossible to say that fear is 
instinctive; because there are as many fears as there are 
conditions that produce fear. The fear of a snake is not 
the same as the fear of thunder. It is necessary, then, to 
list the external forces that. are associated with fear. 
Thorndike says: “On the whole it seems likely that an 
unlearned tendency exists to respond by the physical and 
mental condition known as fear to the situations, ‘thun- 
derstorm, ‘reptiles, ‘large animals approaching one,’ 
‘certain vermin,’ ‘darkness,’ and ‘strange persons of un- 
friendly mien.’”’* It is also probable that there are other 
conditions that awaken fear in the same manner. It is 
very unwise for teachers to attempt to control children 
through the knowledge of their instinctive fears. It is 
the teacher’s function to attempt to do away with ‘these 
fears, or modify the resultant activity. 
Fighting and anger. There is no one specific instinct 
that leads to fighting and another that leads to anger. 
Many situations instinctively lead to anger. There are 
as many different angers as there are situations leading 
to anger. 
In general it may be said that the situations. that lead 
to anger and fighting in a child most often are those that 
are connected with instinctive desires that are thwarted. 
If a child is kept from having something that he desires,   
Educational Psychology, Vol. I, page 63. 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  
* ORIGINAL NATURE OF. THE CHILD 59: 
he naturally responds with angry and pugnacious be- 
havior. Holding a child back when he wants to go ahead, 
holding the hands when he desires to strike, putting a 
desired article beyond reach, are all situations that are 
responded to by a child by fighting against the person 
responsible for the condition. From, the standpoint of 
teaching, it is not best deliberately to produce angry 
behavior in a child. No good can come from such a pro- 
cedure, and it will tend to develop anger and fighting as 
mental habits. If situations are never produced that will 
cause angry or pugnacious responses, the instinctive basis 
for them will become weak through disuse. 
THE FOOD-GETTING AND HABITATION INSTINCTS 
It is impossible to say that there is a single instinct of 
food-getting and another of habitation. Under this gen- 
eral head will be grouped that large number of instincts 
that contribute as an end to food-getting and habitation. 
Eating. Eating is made up of a large number of-in- 
stinctive acts. {The first eating activities of the small 
baby are instinctive. The seeking of the breast, the suck- 
ing movement of the parts of the mouth, the withdrawal 
when satisfied, and the expulsion of bad tasting material, 
are all unlearned activities of the child. Reaching, grasp- 
ing, and putting into the mouth form a series of instinc- 
tive acts, all of which are closely allied with this general 
activity which we call eating. 
Acquisition and possession. Any object that attracts 
the attention of the child and that does not repel him by 
any frightful appearance and is not too large for him 
to handle awakens in the child an instinctive desire for 
acquisition and possession. If someone else, particularly 
another child, is already possessing and enjoying the 
object, the desire for its acquisition and possession be-
-P-A-G-E-76
  60 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
comes much greater. Furthermore, the attempts to keep 
the object away from the child awake a dissatisfaction 
that is satisfied only by acquisition. When the desired 
object is obtained by pursuit, by taking it away from 
someone else, or by some other method, the desire may 
pass away. A child will often strive against great diffi- 
culties to obtain a thing, only to cast it away as soon as 
the difficulties are overcome. In this case the instinct to 
be satisfied is acquisition and not possession. It is the 
getting of the thing and not the thing itself that satis- 
fies the instinctive desire of the child. In the case of 
possession, the instinct is most active when the object in 
question is desired by someone else. When one attempts 
to take an object away from a child, the action that satis- 
fies the instinctive desire of the child is the grasping, 
holding, and if necessary, fighting to keep possession. 
\ Collecting and hoarding. These instincts are closely 
related to acquisition and possession. As'in the previous 
discussion, the objects must be those that attract atten- 
tion, and they must also be small enough to carry away. 
A child will respond to such objects by carrying them 
away and hoarding them. In acquisition and possession 
the instinctive basis was in the getting of the object and 
the holding of it against opposition. In collecting and 
hoarding the interest is in keeping the objects, and the 
satisfaction comes from gloating over them, rearranging 
them, and adding to the collection. The contents of the 
schoolboy’s pocket provide an excellent example. It 
is very rare to find a normal child who is not making a 
collection of postage stamps, tags, pictures, bugs, or 
something else. This instinct oftentimes confuses the un- 
trained teacher. Sometimes the charge of stealing is 
brought against a child who is only satisfying his native 
desire to collect. The wise teacher makes this instinct a
-P-A-G-E-77
  ORIGINAL NATURE OF THE CHILD 61 
great positive good. Nature study and many other classes 
may give opportunity for the children to make collections 
of real positive value. If the instinct for collecting and 
hoarding is satisfied in legitimate ways, there will be 
very little danger of children collecting things that will 
annoy the teacher or endanger their position in society. 
Hunting. The hunting instinct has always been strong 
in our ancestors. At first it was a means of food-getting, 
and became active only when man needed food. 
At the present time it is not employed as a means 
of food-getting, but is classed with the food-getting in- 
stinets because it has in the past been developed through 
them. We no longer chase game when we are hungry 
and pounce upon and kill it when we have succeeded in 
catching it. Even though we do not do this, we still 
have a great natural joy and satisfaction in catching ani- 
mals, including men, that are fleeing from us. Much of 
this type of activity can be seen in men who tramp all 
day after game for the satisfaction of killing some little 
rabbit or bird or catching a fish. The great satisfaction 
is not in the rabbit, the bird, or the fish; it is the process 
of getting them which satisfies a native impulse. In the 
schools of the past when there was no directed physical 
activity, a great amount of activity based on this in- 
stinct was in evidence. In a more advanced form we find 
it in many of the playground games of today where the 
game is based on pursuit and the victory is won when the 
other child is caught. Well planned games of this type 
are valuable in school play because the teacher is working 
with nature and not against it. 
Habitation. It has been shown that there are a large 
number of instincts that are grouped about food-getting. 
In the same manner there are many instincts that are 
related to habitation. Man, apart from training, responds
-P-A-G-E-78
  (2 “AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
with discomfort to being shut up in a small inclosure, 
especially if it is a strange one. A child, finding himself 
in such surroundings, responds by pulling, pushing, kick- 
ing, and in the case of a young child, erying and scream- 
ing. This is the instinctive basis of the punishment that 
is applied when children are put into closets or such 
places of confinement. Many teachers use such punish- 
ment, thinking that the basis of it is that the child is 
kept from being one of the group and will reform in order 
to become a member again in good standing. Keeping a 
child away from the group may be a good form of punish- 
ment, but appealing to the instinctive fear of confinement 
is not good. ; > 
ie 
Children are social creatures. Most of an individual’s 
life is spent in the presence of others. Practically all 
learning takes place in the presence of others, either of 
other children or of adults. The most important instincts 
in education are those that are social, and the schools of 
today furnish a social atmosphere in which children may 
develop. There are a great many social instincts. For 
the purposes of this chapter mention will be made only 
of those that are of greatest value in education. 
Y  Gregariousness. Children, as well’ as adults, prefer to 
be with others of their own kind and are unhappy when 
alone. Among adultsthis desire: to be with others is 
evidenced on every side. It is back of the desire to 
live in cities, to worship in groups, and to do as many 
things together as possible. In the school, gregariousness 
forms the instinctive basis of the social group which is 
so essential in modern education. It also furnishes an 
excellent instinctive basis for punishment. If a child is 
punished by being put out of the group for a time, the THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS
-P-A-G-E-79
  ORIGINAL NATURE OF THE CHILD 63 
punishment is usually very effective. Of course, it must 
be taken for granted that the group from which the child 
is excluded is a reai social group that is meeting the 
child’s desire for association with others. 
Attention-getting. In the presence of other human 
beings who do not frighten one, it seems quite natural to 
try to attract attention. Human beings do not like to go 
unnoticed by their fellowmen. This is especially true of 
children. This desire to attract the attention of the 
teacher or of fellow students can be used to good advan- 
tage by the teacher who is skillful in management. | 
Mastery and submission. These two tendencies have a 
close relationship to each other. It is native to assert ° 
mastery, and also to submit to mastery. Both the mastery 
and the submission when thus native bring satisfaction. 
It seems that the relationship between two individuals is 
a continuous interchange of mastery and submission. 
‘When a child comes in contact with another child who 
does not notice him, there is usually an attempt at mastery. 
This may continue until the other child submits or until 
the other child, having assumed the attitude of mastery 
himself, starts a conflict. The mastery over another, or 
the protection of the weak, a form this instinct some- 
times takes, is satisfying to the child. This instinctive 
interplay of mastery and submission and the -resultant 
pleasure that comes can be of great value to a teacher in 
developing leaders and followers for work units in her 
school. It is unwise to try to kill it o# by punishment. 
Display and shyness. These two types of behavior are 
very closely related to mastery and suomission. Display 
perhaps is, naturally, about the same os mastery, without 
its eruder physical movements. The showing-off of chil- 
dren is in the spirit of mastery over those children or 
adults for whom the show is given. The resultant satis-
-P-A-G-E-80
64 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
faction of having a good audience is probably the same 
satisfaction that comes from having someone submit to 
mastery. 
Shyness, with its resultant hesitation, seems to be on 
the border of submission. The child does not seem to 
know whether to go to the stranger or run away. In 
other words, he does not know whether to submit to mas- 
tery or run away from it. 
ivalry. When a child is engaged in an activity, he 
naturally does better work if there are other children 
working at the same task. If-he can do the best work, 
there is a resulting satisfaction. It is probable that any 
sort of work is done with more interest and better re- 
sults if it is done in the presence of others, particularly 
if they are engaged in like work. These native tendencies 
are of great value in education. Tasks otherwise dull 
take on the thrill of conquest when the element of rivalry 
is present. 
Like many other good things rivalry also has its dan- 
gers. If a teacher depends upon these tendencies to 
accomplish his work, he may teach many things that are 
of no real value. <A child will do anything within reason 
for the sake of rivalry. It is better to have a real inter- 
est in the task at-hand than merely an interest in excel- 
ling another. It is better to learn the multiplication com- 
binations in order to work arithmetic problems than to 
learn them in order to excel the others in the class. How- 
ever, a wise teacher makes a combination of both. A task 
may be done for’ its own sake and still be done better 
because of others working on the same task. 
Envy and jealotsy. The actions of envy and jealousy 
are very closely related to rivalry. In rivalry the child 
attempts to do better than another. In envious behavior 
the child . when he sees another re- 
\ a

ceiving attention or success that he might have had for 
himself. Jealousy is often the result of unsuccessful 
rivalry. While rivalry is to be encouraged as a teaching 
device in school, jealousy should not be made use of. One 
of the best means of doing away with much of jealousy 
and of making good use of rivalry is to introduce group 
rivalry instead of matching child against child. Group 
against group will make good use of emulation without. 
the bad effects of jealousy. 
Kindliness. The common idea that children are natur- 
ally cruel to each dther and that they have no native 
goodness is far from being true. It is instinctive to be 
kind to those in need of help. People who are sick, hun- 
ery, or in trouble get sympathy and help from children. 
This is one of the finest of the native impulses of children 
and should have a chance to come into play whenever 
possible. The teacher should seize every possible opportu- 
nity to allow her children to give to the poor, to comfort 
those in trouble, or in any other manner to use their natu- 
ral tendency to be kind. 
Bullying. The greatest natural tendency that is con- 
trary to kindliness is bullying. It seems to be natural for 
some children to bully and torment others. The presence 
of weakness or sickness may bring forth kindly behavior, 
but the presence of other children in competition often 
produces bullying. This instinct is probably due to a 
combination of several that have been mentioned pre- 
viously. Teasing is oftentimes. closely related to bullying. 
In. fact, this type of activity often starts in teasing and 
develops later into bullying. Whatever the cause or in- 
stinctive background, it is a very active type of behavior. 
A skillful teacher helps the child in his later life by re- 
moving him from the subjects that he may bully and by 
turning the excess energy into more useful. channels 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
66 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
Athletic games where a child plays as a part of a team 
are an excellent cure. 
The above mentioned are the most important of the 
social instincts. They play a prominent part in modern 
education, and every teacher should learn how to deal 
with them. 
Tue Use or Instincts 
If instincts are made use of and if the result is satis- 
fying to the child, a habit is formed which will probably 
last through life. If the activity which results from an 
instinct is unsatisfactory or painful to the child, the 
activity will not be repeated and the instinctive action 
will eventually die out. If no situation ever arises that 
ealls forth the action of an instinct, the instinet will die 
out through disuse. These, then, are the three main re- 
sults that may come from instincts: (1) They may be 
developed into habits; (2) they may die out through re- 
sulting dissatisfaction; or (3) they may die out through 
disuse. : 
One other possible result should be mentioned. Sub- 
. stitution of a desired. end may be made. Tf an instinct 
is leading to bad results, its value may be saved by sub- 
stituting other situations.) A child with a pugnacious 
instinet may be developing into a trouble-maker. The 
teacher who gives the child a legitimate avenue through 
which to exercise the instinct, like basketball or boxing, 
may save the dynamic power of the natural act without 
its bad results. Thorndike says: 
It is a just principle of education to utilize any individual’s 
original nature as a means of changing him for the better, to 
produce in him the information,\ habits, powers, interests, and 
ideals which are desirable. . / .| The~behavior of man in the

collecting and hoarding confuse the untrained teacher? 
5. How may the teacher make the instinct of collecting and 
hoarding a great positive good? 
6. What good may the teacher make from a knowledge of 
the following instinctive tendencies: hunting, habitation, and 
fear? 
7. How may the teacher make use of the gregarious instinct 
in disciplining her pupils? 
8. Why is it unwise for the teacher to kill off by punish- 
ment the instinct of mastery and submission?

results be saved without developing the bad results?

CHAPTER V 9. 
THE LAWS OF LEARNING 
All nature is governed by laws: Plants and animals are 
qonet We Mietoavand at in accordance with the 
laws~of nature, Nothing “just happens.” Learning, 
whether it is the learning of an animal or a human being, 
goes on in accordance with the laws of life. An animal 
trainer in order to be successful in his work must under- 
stand the laws of animal learning) If he works in viola- 
tion of these laws, he fmds it impossible to accomplish 
his purpose. The reason most of us cannot teach an ani- 
mal'to do cireus. tricks is that we do not understand the 
laws of animal learning. It is necessary to know the 
effect of punishment, food, kind words, and other factors, 
in order to teach ananimal. It is essential to know the 
effect of seasons, sunlight, moisture, and soil on a plant 
in order to have success in cultivating it. (In the same 
manner it is necessary to know the basic laws of child 
learning in.order to be successful in teaching a child) 
Many of us who are now adults went to school to teachers 
who were ignorant of these laws of learning. As a result 
we have many bad intellectual habits and many deficien- 
cies that trained teachers would have prevented. 
Tur Brain anp THE Nervous SysTEM 
In order to understand the laws of learning it is neces- 
sary to know something about the brain and the nervous 
system. There is close relationship between mental action 
and the activity of the brain and the nervous system. 
69
-P-A-G-E-86
70 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
The brain and the nervous system are made up of 
nerve cells that are called neurones._-These cells are long 
and fiber-like‘and can be seen only with the aid of a 
microscope. A cross section of a nerve will show that it 
is made up of a great many of these fibers much as a tele- 
phone cable is made up of a large number of separate 
wires. The brain is made up of millions of these neurones. 
To carry the telephone analogy a step further, the brain 
is analogous to “central.” The nerves carry megsages to 
and from the brain, and the brain makes the necessary 
connection. You see a coin and pick it up. From the 
nerve standpoint a message traveled from the eye to the 
brain. The brain made the necessary connection and the 
hand reached for the coin. if 
Neurones have three important properties: (1) sensi- 
tivity, (2) conductivity, and (3) modifiability. (py sensi- 
tivity is meant that neurones are sensitive to certain ele- 
ments in their environment) The neurones that have their 
énding in the retina of the eye are sensitive to the ether 
waves that cause the individual to have the sensation of 
light. The neurones that end in the inner ear are sensi- 
tive to certain air waves that are known to us as sound. 
In a similar manner all of the nerve endings of the,sense 
organs : are sensitive to certain stimuli. 4 , 
y conductivity is meant that neurones are capable of 
transmitting messages from one part of the nervous sys- 
tem to another. )When the sensitive nerve endings in the 
retina of the eye are stimulated, the neurones transmit 
this message to the brain and we have a sensation of 
light. We hear sounds because the neurones that have 
their endings in the ears transmit messages to the brain, 
A man sees that a fence is about to fall down and steps 
back to avoid being hurt. From the standpoint of this 
discussion it is possible to say that the neurones that end 
   
-P-A-G-E-87
  THE LAWS OF LEARNING @) 
in the eye were stimulated and the optic nerve trans- 
mitted the message to the brain. At this point the man 
comprehended the situation and another message was 
sent over neurones to the muscles and the result was that 
the man moved. 
@y modifiability is meant that the connections between 
neurones are subject to modification and change. ) In the 
preceding chapter on instincts it was noted that man 
comes into the world with a great many inborn tenden- 
cies. From the standpoint of neurones it may be said 
that he comes into the world with a great many néurone 
connections and tendencies to connection. When you 
enter a bright room from a dark room the pupils of the 
eyes contract. This activity was never learned. It means 
that you came into the world with the necessary neurone 
connections so that the stimulation of bright light brought 
the contraction of the muscles that control the size of the 
pupil. When a very young child is hungry, the neces- 
sary sucking motions are made because the necessary con- 
nections between neurones are present in the brain. When 
a child first sees something bright, he reaches for it. This 
is a tendency to connection among neurones. The exam- 
ple. will also illustrate modifiability. If the connection 
results in pain to the child, the next time he sees 
light he will not reach for at 
ll learning is based on these three properti 
rones. Nothing new can be learned without é 
No messages can reach the brain without the necessary 
conductivity, and no learning based on experience is pos- 
sip ee pur modifiability. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to give some of the 
important laws of learning. The list is not to be con 
sidered complete, but the most fundamental laws are 
given and illustrated. |

Tue Important Laws or LEARNING 
The law of multiple response. The law of multiple 
response is applicable to. animal as well as to human 
learning. If a chicken is confined within a pen, is hun- 
gry, and can see food without, it will make many re- 
sponses to the situation. Itmay poke its head through 
the small holes in the fence, it may fly against the fence, 
and in various other ways respond to the situation. 
In child learning, multiple response is very common. 
" It is true that some tesponses are determined by brain 
connections that are present at birth. Others are easily 
made because there is a limited number.. However, in 
case there are a great many possible responses, multiple 
response will come into play. 
In pronouncing the words of a foreign language a child 
may attempt a dozen different types of pronunciation 
before he finds the one that sis satisfactory. In a like 
manner he may try a great many responses to other situ- 
ations. This tendency to try a large number until one is 
found that is satisfactory is a basic law of child learning. 
If a child did not tend to make different responses, then 
the law of exercise and the law of effect, a discussion of 
which follows, could not function. 
( The law of effect.’ ‘A child tends to do over again that j 
‘ has resulted in or has been accompanied by 
faction., In terms of neurones the law means that 
when neurone connections are made and the result is 
pleasing to the individual, that neurone connection is 
made over again when the same stimulus comes. The 
converse of this law is that a child tends to ayoid that 
thing that has resulted in or has been aceompanied by 
pain, displeasure, or dissatisfaction. Reducing this again    
_ to the terms of neurones, we say that when a neurone ~ 
connection is made in the brain and the result to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  THE LAWS OF LEARNING Ths 
individual is unsatisfactory or painful, the neurones tend 
to avoid making that connection again. 
This law is a fundamental law in mental life. Its 
working is made possible through the modifiability of 
the neurones. A child puts a stick of candy into his 
mouth and the result is satisfying. Very soon this child 
is putting everything that looks like candy into his 
mouth. If a child sees a cat, pulls its tail and gets 
scratched, he will tend not to do it again. If ke does try 
it again with the same annoying result, he is almost cer- 
tain to discontinue the activity. 
Satisfiers and annoyers are great educators. This law 
seems fo be so reasonable and so common that anyone 
would be aware of it even if he had not studied psychol- 
ogy. However, . an examination of the teaching of the 
past shows that teachers have almost entirely ignored it. 
If a teacher took advantage of the law of effect, he 
would see to it that effective work and satisfying’ situa- 
tions were connected. Yet the converse of this has been 
too often true. 
It has been common in the past for teachers to keep 
children after school as a punishment. The teacher who 
does this ignores the law of effect, because he has deliber- 
ately made school work an annoyer. It would be much 
more sensible to send the bad boy home early, and give 
the good child the privilege of remaining ih school until 
the end of the day. This has been very successfully tried 
in many modern‘schools. If you wish children to love 
school, the school work must always be a joy and never® 
used as a punishment. The teacher who makes a boy 
learn poetry as a punishment for being bad also violates 
the law of effect. The schools should teach boys and_girls 
to love good poetry. Yet when poetry is used as a punish- 
ment, it becomes an annoying situation, and oftentimes 
ng Wess   
-P-A-G-E-90
   14 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDU! 
the love of poetry is completely killed. It is not uncom- 
mon to meet adults today who very heartily dislike poetry 
because they were made to memorize verse upon verse of 
it as a punishment when they went to school. 
The connection of satisfaction and good situations 
does not mean that the teacher should give prizes for good 
work. The natural results of a well done piece of work 
should be satisfying, and the situation should be so ar- 
ranged that the natural results of a poor piece of work 
would be annoying. 
The law of exercise. The oftener a child does a cer- 
tain thing in response to a certain situation the more 
likely he is to make the same response in the future) In 
other words, the doing of a thing many times tends to 
make it a permanent habit. ‘From the standpoint of neu- 
rones it means that when a neurone connection has been 
made a large number of times, that connection tends to 
become permanent. If a child spelled “until” with two 
“Ys” for a hundred times, it would be very hard to get 
him to spell it as it should be spelled. If a child is always 
"made to think of 4 when he sees 2x2, this will soon 
become a permanent connection. 
The converse of this law is often called the law of 
disuse. By disuse we mean that when a ‘neurone connec- 
tion is not used, the tendency is for the connection to 
weaken and‘fall away. For example, a child may learn 
to spell a word correctly. He may spell it correctly a 
hundred times at the beginning of the year. If he has 
no further use for that word and does not spell it again 
for six months, the connections that were made in the 
brain will have weakened so that he will find it neces- 
sary to learn to spell the word again. We usually refer 
to this as deterioration by disuse. 
This law gives us many hints for the teaching of writ- 
   
-P-A-G-E-91
  THE LAWS OF LEARNING 15 
ten work, like spelling. When a word is learned once, it 
must be recalled at frequent intervals in order to keep 
the connection intact. The same thing is true of every- 
thing that is learned by repetition. 
An interesting violation of this law occurs when the 
teacher keeps untrue solutions before children. The 
teacher who writes 2.x 2 = 6 on the blackboard and asks 
the children to correct it is violating this law. 2 x 2 = 6 
is a wrong neurone connection. We wish to have a child 
so trained that every time he sees 2x2 he will think of 
nothing but 4. The teacher who deliberately puts 6 as” 
an answer to 2x2 confuses the neurone connections. 
The teaching of English by having children correct errors 
in written material or conversation is also a violation of 
this law. 
The law of exercise and the law of effect are the basis 
of all drill work in the schools. Two things are necessary 
in any good drill lesson: (1) correct neurone connection 
must be made, and (2) the correct connection should re- 
sult in satisfaction to the child. If you wish children to 
learn all of the multiplication and addition combinations, 
it is necessary to present these combinations many times 
and have them correctly repeated or written by the child, 
and the result to the child must be satisfying. Practice 
in correct writing is another example of the law of exer- 
cise, the vital point being that the correct connection 
should always be made. 
e law of analogy. When a child meets a new Sine 
tion and has no special instincts or habits to determine 
the response, he responds as he has responded in the past 
to a like situation. This is the gia ort 
) The servant who threw water on Sir Walter Raleigh 
when he first saw him smoking was reasoning by analogy. 
It was a new situation to the servant. In the past when
-P-A-G-E-92
  i 76 
  he had seen smoke about a person it meant that the per- 
son’s clothing was afire. Hence the water was thrown to 
put the fire out. ‘The man who drank from his finger bowl 
was meeting a new situation by analogy. He was seated 
at a dinner table. <A dish of water was placed before 
him. In his past experience a dish of water before him at 
a dinner table meant something to drink. So he drank. 
A young child who has eaten colored sticks of candy may 
put a colored stick or even a striped worm into his mouth. 
In all of the above cases a new situation has been met 
by a response based on a like situation. In all of these 
situations the solution has been faulty. This must not be 
taken to mean that all analogous solutions are faulty. _In 
school work correct analogous solutions are very common, 
and much value may be obtained through their use. A 
child may be led to pronounce correctly a new word 
through its relationship to a known word. If a child can 
pronounce “cat” he may, through the relationship, cor- 
rectly pronounce “mat.” <A child may often get the cor- 
rect meaning of a new word through its relationship to 
one or more known words. )’Many arithmetic problems . 
may be solved correctly by relating them to known meth- 
ods of solution. In geography the occupation of a certain 
people may be arrived at through the relationship of this 
country to another. . 
Teachers should make constant use of this type of 
learning. fieny new situations may be solved by the chil- 
dren when the teacher takes the time to point out anal- 
ogous situations) Children should be taught that solu- 
tions of this kind are an aid to learning, but that the 
solution should be carefully verified. 
\'The law. of mind set.’ The response that a child gives 
to any situation depends upon the general set of that 
child’s mind. A stimulus does not always produce the 
   
-P-A-G-E-93
  
THE LAWS OF LEARNING 7 
same response in the same person. Ask a little girl this 
question, “Do you like to play?’ The response will de- 
pend upon the general set of the mind at the time the 
question is asked. If she is seated at the piano, she will 
give it one interpretation; if she is playing with her dolls, 
she will give it another.. In a discussion of a recent article 
with a group of students another example of mind set 
was found. The article in question was by James Harvey 
Robinson and concerned the greatest men in America. 
Dewey was named as one of the group.. When this name 
was given, some members of the group thought of Ad- 
miral Dewey, and others of John Dewey, the philosopher. 
The difference was a difference of mind set. 
here are several laws that are closely related to the 
general principle of mind set. The law of relativity isy 7 
one of them. According to this law any stimults will be 
interpreted not by itself alone, but in its relationship to 
other stimuli that may a¢company or precede it.’ (Sour 
after sweet is not the same as Sour after bittey. A'mer- 
chant in selling damaged goods after a fire made use of 
this law by displaying the blackened goods on a black > 
background. . If displayed on a white background they 
would have looked much more soiled.’ Diminishing re- ¥ - 
turns is another related law. The same stimulus will pro- 
duce a more intense result when added to a weak stim- 
ulus than when added to.a strong one.’ Hencé an ounce 
added to a pound may not be noticed, but an ounce added 
to an ounce is noticed at once. A skort line added.to a 
' long one will not be perceived by the oye, but if added to 
a short line it is noticed at once. p 
Teachers who do not know these fos often misinter-. 
pret children. A question may be /asked by a teacher 
having one set of the mind and ke answered by a child 
having another. This type of ahswer always ‘confuses. 
: }    j
-P-A-G-E-94
  s 
  78 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
* Mind set also explains in part why it is hard for some 
children to understand a question when other children 
haye'no trouble. It also explains the misinterpretation of 
examination questions.) Teachers must also be familiar 
with relativity and diminishing returns in ‘order so to 
arrange situations for the children that they will get the 
best stimuli. The order in which material is presented 
should always be determined on the basis of these laws. 
The law of analysis. Thorndike says, “It thus seems 
to be a general law of mind that any element of mental 
life which is felt as a part of many total mental states 
differing in all else save its presence comes thereby to be 
felt as an idea by itself.’’* 
Learning through analysis is a higher type of learning 
than any other yet referred to. When we are making 
_use of the laws of exercise and effect we are learning 
directly ‘through simple ‘associations. In analysis we 
have much more complicated learning.. If you wish to 
teach a child the meaning of. the word “perpendicular,” 
you may do it by analysis. If a child is shown some per- 
pendicular object, he may through simple association 
think that the word “perpendicular” refers to the object. 
In order to overcome this difficulty we teach such a fact 
through analysis. By using as examples a perpendicular 
wall, a pencil held in a perpendicular position, a string 
with a weight fastened on it, and many other situations 
differing in all*else save the perpendicular element, we 
may get the child to understand what we mean by perpen- 
dicular. When thesy different situations are presented to 
the child, it is necesdary for him to compare them and to 
see that they are alike in one particular. When he sees 
this likeness through \all of them, the teacher should im- 
mediately supply the new word, which is the word ‘“‘per- iti   
IFlements of Psychology, page 217- 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
    
THE LAWS OF LEARNING 719 
pendicular.” All ideas such as these must be taught 
through a process of analysis. 
Furthermore, many subjects can ber better taught by 
analysis than by the common means of association. “an 
example of this is teaching the pronunciation of short 
“e.” A teacher may mark short “e” and pronounce it 
. for the child and have it pronounced several times and 
have the child learn it through the law of exercise. How- 
ever, the child is made much more independent if the 
sound is taught through analysis. The child is already 
familiar with a large number of words containing the 
short “e.” If these words are placed on the blackboard 
and the ‘child notices that they differ in all else save the 
presence of an “e” that is sounded in the same way, it will 
be possible for him to abstract from all of these situations   
  this single element which will be the correct sound for ~ 
short “ec.” If he is taught to pronounce in this manner, it 
will be eek easier for him to handle these situations 
independently later on. 
Probably the best example of teaching through analysis 
is teaching the meaning of numbers. Take for example 
the teaching of the meaning of the number “4,” A child 
probably learns first of all the word “four” in connection 
with the counting of his fingers. Most parents teach 
children to count in this manner. If he begins counting 
with his little finger, then “four” becomes the name of 
the fourth finger. There is no idea of number in this. A 
child probably will pass from this stage to the counting 
stage where he starts with one and counts to a hundred. 
He may still have no number sense. Four here will mean 
that word which comes between three and five in a list 
of associations. When a child starts to count and is 
stopped, it is necessary for him to start over again in 
order to get his association straight. The word “four”
-P-A-G-E-96
  & 80 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION | 
may be written on the board, or the figure “4’ may be 
placed on the board and the child told that this is four. 
However, he may even recognize the word and the symbol 
without having any idea of what is meant by four. 
To teach the ‘‘fourness’’ of this number it is neces- / 
sary to teach it through analysis. If a child is presented ! 
with four chalk marks on_the board, four pencils, fou 
windows on the side of the room, four, classmates, four 
sounds produced by tapping, and asked to find the com- 
mon element, he will probably for the first time get the 
“fourness” of four. This is a case where a child has come 
in contact with a large number of total situations differ- 
ing in all else save the presence of a common element. 
He tends to feel this common element as an idea by itself. 
The laws which have been given in this chapter are the 
most common laws of learning. A teacher who masters 
these laws and makes use of them will do much better 
teaching than the one who is ignorant of their existence. 
It is well to remember that all learning takes place in 
accordance with these laws.

CHAPTER VI 
THE HEALTH OF THE CHILD 
Tuer TEACHER AND THE CHitp’s HEALTH 
It has been noted in a previous chapter that education 
is not a mere matter of gaining knowledge. Hducation 
is is a matter of life and growth. With this idea of educa- 
fion in mind, the health of the school child becomes of 
great importance. It is impossible to conceive of life 
and growth apart from health and bodily vigor. The 
individual who loses his health while getting an “Educa- 
tion” does not have the kind of education referred to 
in this book. It may be possible to gain a vast amount of 
knowledge, and perhaps to learn a trade, at the sacrifice 
of bealth, but a person may have both of these and still 
miss the fundamentals of an education. 
A school system is responsible. for the health of the 
children in its care. The teacher who spends his time 
teaching subject-matter and neglects posture, cleanliness, 
eare of teeth, and other health elements in his school is 
not doing his work well} It is no longer possible for him 
to side-step the question by saying, “I am hired to teach 
children to add, subtract, read, sing, and do other things 
prescribed in the course of study. I am not responsible 
for the condition of the body.” Whether or not a teacher 
is conscious of the fact, he is responsible for the life of 
the children in his care. A child may get through life 
if he does not know al! of the facts of history and geog- 
raphy, or if he cannot do all of the arithmetic problems.

in the course of study. But a child cannot get the most 
out of life if his body has been allowed to deteriorate 
and wear away through carelessness or ignorance. 
There are also many teachers who believe that the 
health of the body is something for the parents to care 
for. But many parents are not able to detect the begin- 
ning of disease as well as a trained teacher or a school 
nurse, and a teacher has a better opportunity to teach 
correct posture and other health habits. 
The teacher must instruct the children in the care of 
the body in the health and hygiene classes. If he wishes 
to teach children how to be clean and why they should 
be clean, he cannot be sure he has done so until the chil- 
dren are clean. Doing is the only adequate test of know- 
ing in such matters. The schools of a generation ago 
attempted to teach health by the knowing method and 
failed. Every child was required to learn pages of things 
he should do, but hé did not do them. The children could 
write on a final examination that it was necessary to 
wash the teeth after each meal and at bedtime, but few 
of them did it. Today in health classes the children not 
only learn what they should do, but they learn to do the 
right thing. In the old school the children, because of 
their knowledge, could pass an examination on how to 
keep well. In the new school the children, through cor- 
rect health habits, can pass a physical examination and do 
keep well. A teacher who understands this difference 
will never excuse himself and say that the child’s health 
is a matter for the parents to deal with.

If a teacher is to show a child how to live a healthy 
life, he must be healthy himself. He cannot say, “Do this

and is not healthy. School officers are demanding healthy 
teachers. At the present time it is impossible for a 
teacher to get a permanent position in a good school sys- 
tem unless he can pass a stringent health examination. 
If education is a matter of life and growth, then the 
teacher must be a growing teacher and one full of life 
and vigor. When education was conceived of as a matter 
of knowledge-getting, the health of the teacher was not 
so vital a point. Today no young man or woman should 
plan to enter teaching unless gifted with a clear mind, 
and possessed of a strong, healthy body. 
Pusitic Scnoot HeattH DepaRTMENTS 
In recent years practically all city school systems have 
established health departments. These departments dif- 
fer in their duties and responsibilities. Some function 
only when an epidemic has broken out in the schools. 
Others are active every day of the year, and prevention 
of disease is their chief business. 
Without doubt the poorest type of health work in the 
city schools is to be found in those cities where the work 
of the health department is restricted to dealing with 
contagious diseases. In most cities where this is true 
the school health department is controlled by the munici- 
pal health officer. If scarlet fever, smallpox, or some 
other contagious disease breaks out in the community, the 
health department immediately becomes active. Schools 
are closed if necessary, homes are quarantined, and all 
necessary precautions are taken to prevent the spread of 
the disease. When the epidemic has been stamped out and 
the children have returned to school, the organization 
ceases to function. Such a department may do good work 
in times of epidemic, but it is valueless in the ordinary 
health work of the schools. Much ean and should be 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
THE HEALTH OF THE CHILD 85 
done in the prevention of disease and the care of the 
body that such an organization cannot do. 
A type of health work that is superior to that described 
above is known as medical inspection. A medical inspec- 
tion department not only functions in case of contagion, 
but carries on a continuous inspection program in the 
schools. Every child in school is examined by a physician 
once each year. Following these examinations, reports 
are made to the parents calling attention to all physical 
defects and tendencies to disease that should be corrected. 
In many cases this work prevents diseases, instead of 
treating them after they have started. But its great 
weakness lies in the fact that it stops with inspection and 
report. If a child is found who needs medical attention, 
a note is sent to the parents, and the matter ends as far 
as the school department is concerned. When one con- 
siders the large number of homes in which the parents 
are careless or in which they do not have the funds for 
proper medical service, it is evident that inspection alone 
falls short. Furthermore, it is impossible to detect some 
diseases when a child is examined but once a year. 
A third type of health work in the schools, which is 
better than either of those noted above, is that in which 
the needy cases are given the necessary medical atten- 
tion. When dental work in the schools is on the inspec- 
tional basis, it is necessary only to report to the parents 
the condition of the teeth of the children. Under the 
better system it is possible, with the consent of the par- 
ents, to correct the defects. When a child is found with 
a physical defect or a disease, the case is followed with 
great care until the condition has been relieved. Some 
opposition has arisen to giving medical aid to children 
in the schools. Most of this opposition comes from peo- 
ple who do not believe in health work of any kind in the  
-P-A-G-E-102
  86 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
schools. However, if children are to live natural, healthy 
lives, the school system must take every precaution to 
protect them when well and bring them back to health 
when sick. 
Probably the best health department for a city school 
system is the one which not only inspects and prescribes, 
but which assumes large responsibilities for the health 
of the children. <A physician to direct the work, and a 
group of physicians to examine and treat the children, are 
requisites. In addition to this, it is necessary to have a 
corps of trained nurses. The nurses spend their time 
going from school to school, keeping a daily check on 
the condition of the children. If children are carefully 
examined once a year by a physician and special cases 
noted and put under control, it is possible for a trained 
nurse to check up on the condition of the children day 
by day. A nurse entering a school can detect the chil- 
dren who have contagious diseases or who are beginning 
to develop the symptoms of a contagious disease. A 
slight rash which may mean nothing to the ordinary 
Aeacher or parent may mean to a trained nurse the coming 
of an infectious disease. 
Thus, the ideal situation in a school system is to have’ 
a sufficient number of doctors and nurses so that the 
health of every child may be safeguarded every day. It 
is not possible in some schools to have the necessary 
doctors and nurses for this work. However, even in the 
rural schools of some sections the school nurse travels 
from school to school and takes care of the health of the 
children. Teachers who are compelled to serve in schools 
where there is no health service and no nurses must be 
even more alert than those in schools with proper health 
supervision, because the health of the children depends 
upon the teacher alone.

THE HEALTH OF THE CHILD 87 
Tue Cuiwn’s Heauta 
In a book of this nature it is of course impossible to give 
detailed information concerning matters of health. How- 
ever, attention will be called to several of the important 
problems in the field of health, problems which have a 
profound effect upon the degree of success the teacher 
may have in his work of turning out well developed, 
intelligent human beings, good citizens of the Republic. 
A child cannot do good school work when he is suffering 
from poor health. 
Seeing. The children of today use their eyes much 
more than did the children of the last generation. Library 
books are available for practically all of them. Moving 
pictures have imposed an unusual burden on the eyes. 
This added strain often results in more or less serious 
defects. A teacher may see that some children are suf- 
fering from eye trouble by observing their work in the 
schoolroom. Obvious squinting while reading an ordi- 
nary book, and the inability to see the blackboard are 
common symptoms. However, the teacher should ‘have a 
more accurate method of determining how well his pupils 
can see. A chart for testing eyes may be obtained from 
the state department of health or may be borrowed from 
a physician. With such a chart. it takes but a few min- 
utes to determine the condition of the eyes of the chil- 
dren in the room. Having discovered which children 
have poor eyes, the teacher should immediately report 
the matter to the parents and do his best to get the eyes 
taken care of and glasses furnished if necessary. The 
teacher should also seat the children so that each is given 
the best location possible for the condition of his eyes. 
It is a very common experience to find children who 
are retarded in their school work because of poor vision.
-P-A-G-E-104
    
88 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
The removal of a bad school condition or the supplying 
of glasses may often overcome retardation; but the 
teacher should also always see that the physical condi- 
tions of the room are as good as they can be made. Chil- 
dren should not be required to work in a direct light. If 
a teacher finds it necessary to use such a room, he should 
be careful that the shades are correctly placed. If the 
children must face windows the light should be shut off 
with shades. Light that comes from one side should be 
supplied in abundance. It is a common experience for 
a principal to go into a teacher’s room and find window 
shades that should be up, lowered half way to the bottom. 
A teacher often lowers shades in the morning to keep out 
sunlight, and forgets to raise them in the afternoon. 
The teacher should be alert concerning the physical con- 
ditions of the room. He cannot reconstruct the school 
building, but he may often better conditions by suggest- 
ing that the walls of the building be painted a buff color, 
if they have been painted a color so dark that most of the 
light is absorbed. Dead white, which reflects a too 
glaring light, should be avoided. The teacher may sug- 
gest the purchasing of proper shades and even the chang- 
ing of windows. 
Teachers, when selecting books for children, should be 
careful that the print in the books is not too small. Every 
book bought for the library and every book assigned for 
reading should have large, clear type, and adequate 
spacing. 
Hearing. It is impossible to divide children into two 
groups—those who have defective hearing, and those who 
have not. In hearing, the defects range from the slightest 
ineapacity to complete deafness. It is as easy for a 
teacher to test the hearing of children as it is to test 
their vision. An ordinary watch held at various dis-  
-P-A-G-E-105
THE HEALTH OF THE CHILD 89 
tances from the ear, with the child’s eyes blindfolded, 
will enable the teacher to measure the distance that the 
child can hear. A teacher may thus compare the dif- 
ferent children in his room by the distance they can hear 
the watch. Children are often found deaf in one ear and 
yet ignorant of their defective hearing. The teacher 
should always note the condition of the ears of the chil- 
dren. Often a child will be found whose ears are dis- 
charging matter freely, and yet apparently nothing is 
being done for him at home. 
Children who cannot hear cannot do good school work. 
It is true that they may still read their books, but the 
most important part of the school work—that which 
comes from the interchange of experiences—is closed to 
the child. When a teacher discovers a child whose hear- 
ing is defective, he should report it at once to the parents 
and to the school physician, if there is one. Many times 
the defect may be very easily remedied. The teacher 
can be of great service to the children by showing them 
how properly to care for their ears, the bad effects of 
putting things into them, and the necessity of examina- 
tion and treatment when ears are in bad condition. Some 
of the retardation in the schools at the present time is due 
to defective hearing which can in most cases be remedied. 
Seeing and hearing are two functions that immediately 
reflect on the school work. There are other functions 
which do not reflect so directly on the school work but 
which are of primary importance in life. 
Breathing. Children should be taught to breathe prop- 
erly. Breathing does not reflect as directly on school work 
as do seeing and hearing, but it has a very marked effect 
on children. If a child is to do the best kind of work, he 
must be able to enter into all of the activities of the school. 
Children who have trouble with their breathing usually
-P-A-G-E-106
“90 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
are handicapped, particularly in physical training work. 
A teacher should examine his pupils with care and find 
the children who are mouth breathers. When a child 
habitually breathes with his mouth open instead of breath- 
ing through his nose, it is usually an indication that there 
is something wrong with the throat. Usually such a child 
has adenoids, and the breathing will be normal again 
when the adenoids are removed. 
Many children breathe incorrectly because they do not 
know how to breathe correctly. Hence it is necessary 
for the teacher to give the children specific instructions 
in proper breathing. This can be done in the periods of 
physical training or in other periods when attention is 
given to posture. A teacher may be of great service to 
the children if he sees that breathing is done correctly. 
Posture. There is no physical condition of children for 
which a teacher is more responsible than posture. When 
a teacher has charge of children all day, five days of 
the week, he has a much better chance than the parents 
to teach the children how to stand, walk, and sit. A 
teacher should know that incorrect posture is a breeder 
of deformity and disease. Curvature of the spine is very 
commonly caused by poor posture, and other complica- 
tions may arise because, as a result of poor posture, the 
vital organs are crowded out of their proper place. Chil- 
dren who recite standing on one foot and throw the 
weight of their body to one side are beginning bad habits 
of posture which may later lead to something serious. 
Correct posture while sitting is as important as cor- 
‘ reet posture while standing. The old school seats that 
came in assorted sizes, were rigid, and could not be ad- 
justed to fit the child, thus causing poor sitting posture. 
Most modern schools are fitted with chairs or adjustable 
furniture. It is not uncommon, however, to see adjustable 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
THE HEALTH OF THE CHILD OL 
furniture that has not been adjusted. The teacher in 
charge of a room should always see that such equipment 
has been accommodated to the needs of the child using it. 
He should feel a personal responsibility concerning the 
sitting and walking posture of every child under his care. 
Teeth. One of the last lessons that has been learned 
concerning the care of the body has had to do with the 
care of the teeth of children. For many years there has 
been a tradition that, because the baby teeth of chil- 
dren drop out anyway, there was nothing particular 
to be gained by caring for them. This is known to be 
false. When the baby teeth are correctly cared for, the 
child has a better chance to develop good permanent 
teeth. Recently, doctors have become aware of the fact 
that many diseases can be traced to poor teeth. Every 
decaying tooth is a source of infection, and infection in 
the body means disease. It is alarming to know that a 
large percentage of school children have decaying teeth. 
It is very hard for teachers to do a constructive piece 
of work with the teeth of children. It is an easy matter 
to get the dental charts, record on them the teeth that 
are decaying, and write to the parents, telling them that 
the child should have dental care. But parents are more 
careless of the child’s teeth than they are of any other 
part of the child’s body. They may be repeatedly noti- 
fied that their child’s teeth are decaying, and yet not take 
the child to a dentist. This condition may be remedied 
when a school has a dental clinic where the child may be 
sent. But for a teacher in the one-room school, in the 
small school system, or in the school where there is no 
dental clinic, it is a difficult matter to deal with. Prob- 
ably the best thing that a teacher can do under such 
circumstances is to call the attention of the parents to 
the condition and give the children careful, systematic
-P-A-G-E-108
  92 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
lessons on the necessity of caring for the teeth and the 
dangers of decay. Children who do not clean their teeth 
at home should be encouraged to clean them at school. 
The toothbrush drill is good for any schoolroom. 
Cleanliness. Teachers should teach children how to be 
clean, why they should be clean, and then make sure that 
they are clean. In many parts of the country and in sec- 
tions of every city this kind of teaching may not be 
necessary. But many children come to school in a de- 
cidedly unclean condition. The inspection of hands, faces, 
and finger nails is a step in the right direction. Some 
teachers not only inspect the hands and faces of children, 
but the clothing and shoes as well. 
The teacher by being clean and neat himself, by teach- 
ing cleanliness and neatness to the children, and by check- 
ing up on the results may accomplish marvelous things. 
It is possible in districts where children live in dirty, un- 
sanitary homes to do much in school. In many cases 
classes of children are being taught in school to shampoo 
their hair, clean their finger nails, polish their shoes, and 
wash and mend their clothes. School baths are also 
becoming common. \A bathroom recently installed in a 
school in the poor section of a western city is used every 
hour of the day. The children from the poor homes bring 
their clean underwear to school, take a bath, and change 
their clothes. }In this particular school hundreds of chil- 
dren who were dirty all year are now being thoroughly 
cleaned every week and are taking care of their hands 
and faces and clothing as they never did before. The 
effect of this work in the school often spreads to the home 
and the parents benefit from it. 
Malnutrition. Malnutrition is very common among 
American school children. It is practically as common 
among children of wealthy parents as among those of the
-P-A-G-E-109
  THE HEALTH OF THE CHILD 93 
poor. Malnutrition may be caused by lack of food, by 
lack of ability to digest food, or by improper food. The 
first cause is found largely among the children from the 
poorest homes. The second cause may be found among 
children from any class, because it is a physical weak- 
ness. The third is usually found among children of well- 
to-do parents. 
At the present time standard charts are available that 
give the normal healthy weights for boys and girls of 
various ages and heights. Conditions and the school 
organization permitting, it is extremely easy to strip 
children, weigh them, and compare the weight with the 
standard. It is possible thus to determine the percent- 
age of underweight or overweight. <A letter of suggestion 
to the parents will often help correct the conditions. 
Many children, instead of eating breakfast, have the 
bad practice of buying candy and bringing it to school. 
A teacher can be of great service by teaching the chil- 
dren to eat correct food. He may also bring the parents 
into the school and show them the type of food the chil- 
dren should eat. One of the means now employed to do 
away with malnutrition is the furnishing of milk or hot 
lunches during the day. Much of the nervousness and 
inability to study due to malnutrition can be removed 
by the codperation of the school and the home. 
Tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is America’s most destruc- 
tive disease. It attacks thousands of children of school 
age. It is known by medical authorities to be preventa- 
ble. A teacher has no more sacred responsibility than 
that of protecting children against it. The most effective 
enemies of this disease are play, fresh air, good food, and 
sunshine. The school that is filled with fresh air, has 
periods of outdoor play, and hot lunches will do more than 
anything else to guard children against tuberculosis. 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  94 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
It is very difficult for physicians to detect tuberculosis 
in its beginning stage, but in spite of this, every child 
should be carefully examined every year by a competent 
physician. If a child is infected or is found to be sus- 
ceptible to this disease, every precaution should be taken, 
not only to make this child well, but to guard other chil- 
dren. A modern method of caring for tubercular school 
children is the open-air schoolroom. The schoolroom that 
is open all day and flooded with sunshine, and where the 
children are given their hot lunches and sufficient exer- 
cise, often completely cures tuberculosis. If every school 
child is watched carefully, and if every school provides 
physicians and proper schoolrooms, tuberculosis can be 
practically stamped out. 
Cripples. The feeling toward cripples has usually been 
one of sympathy. Crippled children are not in need of 
sympathy as much as of common sense treatment. In 
some cities, as in Chicago, automobiles call for crippled 
children and take them to special schools. However, 
most teachers are compelled to serve in schools where 
there are no such provisions made. In all such cases the 
teacher should make every effort to have the children 
correctly taken care of. 
In Spokane, Washington, and in many other cities, 
every crippled child gets the best of medical attention, 
and an operation if advisable, at the expense of the 
Rotary Club. In almost every community there is some 
organization that will pay the bill if the child’s parents 
are not able to do so. A teacher can do a great service for 
such children if he tries every possible means of bringing 
them back into normal condition. If it is impossible to do 
this, then the teacher should give the crippled child every 
possible chance to get such education as will make his life 
worth while.

THE HEALTH OF THE CHILD 95 
Sleep. Teachers oftentimes have trouble with children 
. because of nervousness and drowsiness. One .of the com- 
monest causes of this condition is lack of sleep. Authori- 
ties do not agree as to the amount of sleep necessary for 
a child, but they do agree that children should have 
enough sleep so that they are wide awake and ready to 
do their work when they come to school. If a child is 
drowsy or shows signs of lack of sleep, the teacher should 
make an investigation of the home conditions. Some 
children are compelled to get up at a very early hour to 
deliver newspapers or do other kinds of work, or they 
may be up late at night to do work. However, it will be 
found that other causes will explain most of the cases. 
It is very common for children to stay up late at night to 
read stories, sometimes after their parents think they are 
asleep. A careful examination of the sleep habits of 
children will oftentimes relieve teachers of some of their 
problems of discipline. In many schools it is found ad- 
visable, particularly with the weaker children, to have a 
sleep period following lunch. This brings good results 
in most eases. 
First aid. Every teacher should be able to administer 
‘first aid. No teacher will ever serve for a long period 
without finding it necessary at some time to take care of 
cuts, bruises, burns, and in extreme cases, suffocation or 
drowning. He should, then, whether teaching alone in a 
rural school or in a large school in a city system, know 
the basic principles of first aid in order to care for the 
children in his room. 
Tue ScHoen Bumpine 
The school building is not planned by the teacher, and 
hence it is impossible for him to install the right kind of 
service systems and make the building conform to the
-P-A-G-E-112

best ideals of school architecture. But it is possible for 
him to make the best use of the plant in which he works. 
He should be very careful to see that the ventilation sys- 
tem in the building is correctly used. If there is no such 
system, he should be ever alert to provide proper ventila- 
tion by windows or by some other means. He should also 
see that his room is clean. Many teachers pay no atten- 
tion to the physical surroundings, but every teacher 
should insist that the floor be properly swept and the 
room properly dusted. If tke teacher is working in a 
city school system, the principal and the other school 
authorities will appreciate his interest in his room. 
He should also be watchful of the temperature of his 
room. Some teachers get interested in their school work 
and forget the temperature. If the room is not provided 
with a thermostat, the teacher will often allow the tem- 
perature to run up too high or drop too low. He should 
have a fixed habit of reading the thermometer at certain 
times and caring for the temperature of the room. He 
should also pay special attention to the conditions of the 
toilet rooms to see that they are fully provided with 
water for washing and that they have been properly 
cleaned and cared for. The teacher should also give 
particular attention to the drinking facilities in his room. 
If children use a drinking fountain, they should be in- 
structed as to the proper method of drinking. If the old- 
fashioned drinking pail is used, it will be necessary for 
the teacher to see that sanitary drinking cups are pro- 
vided. These are a few of the things that a teacher should 
watch with great care if the children are to work under 
proper physical conditions.

SUMMARY OF PART TWO 
Part Two has been concerned solely with the child as an 
object of study. A teacher may have a good philosophy 
of education; he may codperate with the community, but 
if he does not also deal wisely with the physical condition 
of the children in his care, he is not fulfilling his respon- 
sibilities. He must feel the necessity of testing the eyes 
and ears. He must see that children practice good posture, 
keep clean, and have the necessary physical exercise. In 
a city school system, the health department must not only 
care for epidemics and make medical examinations, but it 
should accept the responsibility for the remedying of de- 
fects. Defective physical conditions hinder development, 
and thousands of children come from homes in which, 
either through ignorance or carelessness, they do not re- 
ceive proper care. The school must give that care. 
Every child comes into the world with a great wealth 
of instincts, and many of his actions, from birth through 
the period of childhood, are the result of these instincts. 
No teacher can deal intelligently with children without 
having a thorough knowledge of original tendencies. A 
teacher who understands the child knows how to deal with 
manipulation, collecting, hoarding, rivalry, gregarious- 
ness, bullying, and a host of other important actions. He 
knows how to make those powerful forces in healthy, nor- 
mal development. Much of the usual talk about the bad- 
ness of children comes from those who do not understand 
instincts.

  100 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
Learning is a modification and redirection of the original 
nature of the child, expressed in his instincts. For ex- 
ample, the modification and redirection of the instinct of 
manipulation makes it possible for the child to learn _to 
write and to draw. This modification and redirection fol- 
lows definite laws which are known as the laws of learning. 
The way the teacher applies the laws of learning consti- 
tutes the method of teaching. A method of teaching is 
sound just to the extent that it makes possible the working 
of the laws of learning. The teacher who understands the 
laws of learning helps children to learn in the most econom- 
ical manner, When teachers work contrary to these laws 
the results are often disastrous. 
In Part Three analysis will be made of the method of 
teaching, and it will be found that the method of teaching 
must correspond with the method of learning employed by 
the child.

CHAPTER VII 
THE PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 
Wuat Is Meruop? 
Method is simply a way of going to work to get some- 
thing done. It is a systematic way of doing something 
and is just the opposite of random, hit-or-miss, trial-and- 
error ways of working. The carpenter has a method of 
building a house; the general has a method of prepar- 
ing to fight a battle; the mayor has a method of gov- 
erning a city; the farmer has a method of planting, culti- 
vating, and harvesting his crops; the merchant has a 
method of advertising and selling his goods. So in teach- 
ing, method is nothing more nor less than the orderly 
routine to be followed in accomplishing certain definite 
results. Method is but another name for the activities 
engaged in by the teacher and the pupils. 
A well-known authority on methods of business efficiency 
relates the following incident in his book on that subject: 
In the summer of 1912 I attended a field day of athletic sports 
at a boys’ school. 
One of the contests was. swimming under water for distance. 
Dr. Luther Gulick, who was with me, asked one of the boys 
whom we knew if he intended to enter it. 
He said he did not, because, while he could swim under water, 
he had not trained for it. 
“Would you enter the race,” we asked, “if you were sure you 
could win?” 
“Why certainly,” he replied. 
“We can tell you how to win it,” we said. 
He looked skeptical, but waited respectfully. “How long can 
103 
   
-P-A-G-E-120
  
104 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
you hold your breath?” asked Dr. Gulick, taking out a stop watch. 
“T don’t know.” 
“Try it and find out. Hold your breath just as long as you 
can now.” 
He filled up his lungs and held his breath manfully for 56 sec- 
onds. 
“You have held your breath four seconds less than a minute,” 
we told him. “Is that as long as you can hold it?” 
“Yes, sir.” 
“And yet there are people who hold their breath for three or 
four minutes. A sea lion can hold his breath under water for 35 
minutes. Any normal boy of your age can hold his breath for 
two minutes without hurting himself. The secret is to breathe 
deeply and slowly many times, thus over-oxygenating the blood, 
then with the lungs full, to hold the breath. Now, we shall hold 
the watch again, and give you the signal. You can hold your 
breath two minutes.” 
We held the watch and he did as we told him. It was a hard 
struggle, but he managed it. 
“You see,” we said, “you ean hold your breath twice as long as 
you thought you could. Now, how many strokes do you take in 
a minute when you swim under water? 
“Make the motions with your arms just as you make them in 
the water, and we shall count.” 
We found he made sixteen strokes a minute. 
“Now,” we said, “you know you can hold your breath for two 
minutes. You know that by counting twenty-four strokes you 
will know when a minute and a half is up. Now, you go into 
this race, dive into the water, swim full twenty-four strokes—it 
will not kill you, and you will win.” 
Then the instructions were written out so that he could not 
possibly make any mistake about it. This boy had no idea of 
entering the swimming contest, because he thought he had no 
chance to win it; in other words, he did not know how to win, 
and so he thought there was no use trying. An hour later he 
easily won the swimming-under-water contest.t 
The stumbling block which kept this boy from entering 
the contest at first was that he did not know the best way 
  
Emerson, H., Business ficiency, Chap. I.

THE PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 105 
to win. Being ignorant of the method of best utilizing the 
power that was in him, he felt that it was hopeless for 
him even to try. But that is not all. The other boys in 
the contest were perfectly willing to try, were full of 
enthusiasm for the competition; but their best efforts 
were frustrated by their lack of knowledge of the means 
of using their enthusiasm and ability. They were relying, 
as we say, on main strength and ignorance. They had not 
learned the best way to do the work that was before them. 
Before going into the water the one boy knew the one 
best way to do what he was trying to do, and he knew 
that he could do it, because he based his calculations on 
accurate knowledge, while the other boys had simply been 
going by guesswork. They spent several weeks practic- 
ing swimming under water, but it never occurred to any 
one of them to find out by a watch how long he could 
hold his breath or to find out how many strokes he could 
take per minute under water. 
It makes no difference what one’s work may be: whether 
he be a bricklayer or a school teacher, there is one best 
way to do it, and his only aim and object should be to 
find that way and follow it. We are unjust to ourselves 
and to our work, we waste our best energies and lose our 
finest opportunities when we do not seek out and follow 
the most efficient method of employing our powers in the 
work that is given us to do. Knowing how to do a thing 
the best way and knowing that you can do it are ninety- 
nine per cent of doing it. 
How does all this apply to teaching? By way of illus- 
tration let us compare two teachers. One works by old 
haphazard, hit-or-miss, trial-and-error method, and the 
other by a method that is based upon a sound philosophy 
and psychology of education. The first teacher receives 
his instructions and the course of study from the super-

intendent, and is assigned to a certain grade in the ele- 
mentary or high school. He starts out in an aimless sort 
of way, without any definite plan of how he is going to 
get results, but with just a hazy notion that he is to teach 
school. He flounders along from week to week without 
following any definite plan of work; one day he tries this, 
one day he tries that, and the next day he tries some- 
thing else; in fact, he has no special reason for doing 
any particular thing. 
The second teacher determines first of all what is to 
be done and then seeks the best method of doing it. He 
has a clear, sound conception of the function of the school 
in its relation to society; he understands the significance 
and place of subject-matter and how to present it; and he 
is intelligent regarding the nature of the child with whom 
he is to work. Thus equipped, he proceeds to his task with 
every opportunity of service and success. 
Tue Function or Epucationan MerHop 
(Method is the way we bridge the gap between the child 
and society; “There is the individual on the one hand 
and the world in which he must live on the other. Men 
have been living here a long time and have accumulated 
a great deal of knowledge which somehow or other must 
guide each new traveler, but how shall these two terms of 
the educational equation be brought together?! The 
question is, what can we do to bridge this gap between 
the child and society? How can children learn to the 
best advantage? What can we do to assist them in their 
learning? How does the child, ignorant, helpless, and 
dependent, finally become a useful member of society? 
The solution of this tremendous and complicated problem 
is, then, the true function of educational method.

THE PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 107 
Factors Wuicu DrerermMine MretHop 
The major factors which determine the principles of 
method are: the aims of education, the nature of the child, 
and the nature and needs of society. The history of edu- 
cation shows clearly that aims not only determine the 
subject-matter and materials to be used, but also the 
method of presenting them. The way in which the sub- 
ject-matter is presented by the teacher will depend upon 
the purpose that he seeks to accomplish. When the aim 
of education was to discipline the mind, the method and 
practice reflected the idea. When highly centralized 
systems of education impress the teacher with the idea 
that the aim is to pass certain examinations, the method 
of teaching clearly shows the existence of that belief. 
ConFuicting Aims ReveaLep IN Present MertHop AND 
Practice 
In general, our present method and practice reveal two 
contrasting and apparently conflicting aims. One aim 
is merely to transmit or impart a certain amount of edu- 
cational material or subject-matter; when the teacher has 
taught the lesson, has imparted information to the pupils, 
he feels his duty is done. The other aim is to use this mate- 
rial or subject-matter for the purpose of forming certain 
ideals or predispositions, and to give new significance to the 
facts of everyday living. 
There need not necessarily be a conflict between these 
two aims. Legibility and speed in penmanship can be 
developed along with an appreciation of and a desire for 
neatness. A spelling consciousness can be developed to- 
gether with the ability to spell. Rate and comprehension 
in reading need not be sacrificed in developing a keen 
appreciation of and taste for good literature. Speed and 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  ; 108 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
accuracy in the fundamental processes of mathematics 
need not be sacrificed through the study of problems that 
introduce the pupil into the fields of astronomy, survey- 
ing, engineering, economics, and sociology. Important 
historical and geographical facts need not be neglected in 
bringing about the enlargement of the significance of 
direct personal experience. As McMurry says: 
Instruction cannot rest with cold facts alone. Its quality is to 
be measured partly by its provision for the growth of motive. 
One object of teaching a pupil how to keep the skin healthy 
should be to arouse a desire on his part to practice the rules of 
hygiene thus learned. One object of teaching him how to play 
games should be to make him want to learn more games, even 
throughout life. One object of teaching the Crusades in history 
might well be, by showing how superficial the causes were, and 
how much the warfare cost, to influence the youth’s attitude 
toward the present movement for arbitration. One object of 
teaching about John Hampden is to lead pupils to determine to 
imitate him.! 
We are prone to allow ourselves to think of education as a 
manufacturing process with so many units of reading, 
geography, and arithmetic put into the machine and a fin- 
ished product turned out—an educated individual. No 
matter how well selected and proportioned the mixture or 
raw material may be, or how well it is adapted to the 
capacity of the learner, unless worthy ideals, desires, and 
appreciations have been developed and transformed into 
spiritual and social forces, all is unavailing. In the follow- 
ing passage Bagley shows the interdependence of knowledge 
and ideals: 
One might acquire information regarding civic organization, 
social hygiene, good government, and a host of other socially 
important topics, but unless one were inspired with powerful 
socializing ideals, the knowledge would be a luxury without a pur-

pose. Similarly, one might be possessed of the strongest social 
motives, and still be unable to realize one’s aims because one 
lacked the facts and principles that must be interpolated as 
means to ends. The failure of mere knowledge to work social 
reforms is too obvious to need discussion. The failure of unin- 
telligent enthusiasm has been painfully apparent in connection 
with the well-meaning but often futile attempts that have been 
represented by political corruption, child labor, the miscarriage 
of justice, and the social evil.* 
Tue Test or True MerHop 
The term methods has been applied not only to the 
important phases of the teaching process, but also to petty 
devices and tricks of the trade used by the teacher. And 
so we have a bewildering array of general and special 
methods, primary methods, intermediate grade methods, 
junior high school methods, and senior high school meth- 
ods. In arithmetic we have had the Grube Method, the 
Speer Method, the Spiral Method, and the Practical 
Method. In reading we have had the A B C Method, 
the Word Method, the Sentence Method, and countless 
others. In writing we have had the Spencerian, the 
Vertical, the Zaner, and the Palmer Methods. These 
should not be thought of as so many different methods of 
teaching, but merely as different forms that method may 
take. We should remember that method is not deter- 
mined by any external or mechanical form of procedure, 
nor is it dependent upon educational fads and the whim 
of the teacher. Method is a fundamental thing in the 
educative process, and thus makes possible a science of 
education. It is possible to develop a method of teach- 
ing which is capable of being adapted to all subjects and 
classes. This is true because the laws of learning are the   
1Educational Values, page 153. Reprinted by permission of The Macmillan

    110 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
same wherever we find them. ‘The real test of method 
depends upon its utilization of the laws of learning, and 
method is sound just to the extent that it makes possible 
the operation of these laws. 
Tue Meruop or TEAcHING AND THE MetHop or LEARNING 
(The method of teaching must correspond with the 
method of learning employed by children. <A child learns 
through his own responses) It is not what is presented 
to him that educates him, but rather the responses that he 
himself makes to what is presented. What the child does 
is the great factor in learning; in other words, it is the 
self-activity of the pupil which educates him. For this 
reason a child often learns more from other pupils than 
he does from his teacher, and he may learn more outside 
of the school than in school. 
Learning is taking place wherever an individual is re- 
sponding to his environment and profiting by his past 
experiences. Wherever active children are growing and 
developing, some phase of their environment is serving as 
the material for the learning process. If education is a 
process of experience-getting or of enriching life, it is 
possible for the child to get an education without going 
to school. However, the school is organized for the purpose 
of facilitating this process of experience-getting. 
Tue Principtes or TRUE MerHop 
Organizing and utilizing the child’s self-activity. 
Although it is important to remember that. the method of 
teaching must be based on the tendencies of self-activity 
that are present, we must not forget, as Miller says, 
that: 
Activity as an end in itself is just as bad as knowledge as an 
end in itself. We want activity that gets somewhere. A large
-P-A-G-E-129
  THE PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 1i1 
part of the child’s undirected activity has important results, but 
school method is concerned with the problem of making sure that 
the self-activities of children are called forth in situations under 
which the conditions are right for fruitful results. We do not 
want whittling merely for the pleasure of making shavings, but 
rather whittling that produces something that will reward the 
activity more richly. We do not want mere scribbling, but scrib- 
bling that leads on to writing and drawing. We do not want 
merely curious prying around in the garden and in the museum, 
but prying around that shall discover interesting and valuable 
things.1 
Since self-activity is the only basis of learning, we must 
remember that self-activity involves the reconstruction 
of old experiences in order to assimilate new ones. Four 
men are walking through a forest. One of them says, 
“What a fine place for a sawmill”; another one says, 
“What a wonderful place to paint a picture”; another one 
says, “What a dandy place to hunt squirrels”; another 
one says, “What a beautiful site for a natural park.” 
Thus we see that each one of these men responded to a 
common situation in a different way, and his response 
was entirely determined by the host of his past experi- 
ences. He reacted toward a new situation on the basis 
of past experiences. The method of teaching is simply 
a plan whereby we build on pupils’ old experiences and 
provide new ones. In order to do this the teacher must 
understand the past experiences of his pupils and build 
his instruction upon these. If the pupil has the necessary 
past experiences the teacher connects the new with these. 
If, however, the pupil lacks the necessary past experi- 
ences these must be provided in order that he may learn 
the new. 
It is interesting to notice the various responses chil-

112 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
dren make because of their meager past experiences. A 
little boy received a dime and took it out in the garden 
and planted it. He returned to the house and told his 
mother that he had planted the dime and would soon have 
a tree full of dimes. A boy, upon being asked how old 
he was, replied that when he stood on his feet he was six 
and when he stood on his head he was nine, because a six 
turned upside down was nine. 
The method of teaching must not only enlarge and 
enrich the experiences, but it must also properly organize 
them. They must be organized with reference to mean- 
ing, understanding, and judgment. For\example, the 
experience of learning to count must be developed into 
addition, and this experience of adding must be devel- 
oped into that of multiplication. After a proper study 
of hygiene and sanitation, such things as ash heaps, gar- 
bage pails, fly traps, and drinking fountains have a new 
meaning to the pupil, and his environment is enlarged to 
that extent. 
The only sound justification for teaching any subject 
is to make it a means of enabling each child to reor- 
ganize his experiences and widen his outlook on life. 
Subject-matter representing desirable experiences which 
we want the child to have must be woven in with various 
other things. This, if rightly done, is at the same time 
training in thinking; for in order to get the application 
of the subject-matter to various other things, the pupil 
must reorganize his past experiences. It is this process 
that we call thinking. As Dewey says: “Every recitation 
in every subject gives an opportunity for establishing 
cross connections between the subject-matter of the les- 
son and the wider and more direct experiences of every- 
day life.”? 
1Democracy and Education, page 191.  
-P-A-G-E-131
  THE PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 113 
Method and thinking. Unless new facts are presented 
in such a way as to enrich one’s past experiences, the 
process of learning becomes formal and disconnected 
from life. Since thinking is the reconstruction of our 
past experiences in order to make possible the assimilation 
of new facts, learning without this process becomes mere 
memorizing. A pupil may recite or reproduce very ac- 
curately ‘without any understanding of what he is say- 
ing. There is a prevalent tendency among teachers to 
over-emphasize memory work and place more or less of a 
premium upon it. Perhaps it is not too sweeping a state- 
ment to make, that a large percentage of the grades or 
marks which pupils receive in the public schools is based 
upon their ability to reproduce mere facts. As evidence 
of this we need only note in the average recitation or 
examination the large number of memory questions and 
the small proportion of thought-provoking questions. A 
pupil once criticized a teacher, saying, “I do not like 
Miss B because she never asks any questions in the book.” 
This was a frank confession that the child felt far safer 
when relying on his memory than when forced to think 
the answers out for himself. 
Unless the learner interprets new facts of social worth 
in such a way as to relate them intimately to what he 
already knows, the method of teaching has failed to 
attain its proper function, and education its proper aim. 
Subject-matter is not something to be poured into a child, 
but rather something he is going after in order to accom- 
plish some purpose. The weak point in conventional 
teaching is the failure to recognize that an individual is 
being educated only when he plans, purposes, executes, 
judges, and generalizes for himself. What each pupil 
plans, executes, and judges is the great factor in teach- 
ing; therefore, the function of a teacher is to help the  
-P-A-G-E-132
114 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
child form worthy purposes and achieve these purposes. 
The teacher’s ability to arouse purposes will depend 
largely upon his knowledge of the child and the subject- 
matter. 
Thinking always starts with a problem, a feeling of 
doubt, perplexity, confusion, need, or a lack of adjust- 
ment. Then comes a suggestion or possible explanation, 
which is examined on its merits—that is, whether it has 
any bearing or will shed any light on the problem. From 
this point we may proceed in two definite ways. We may 
collect all the facts and data that can be explained by 
means of the suggestion, or we may predict on the basis 
of the suggestion the facts we shall find. 
In the following passage Dewey shows, in an admirable 
way, the relationship which exists between method and 
thinking: 
Processes of instruction are unified in the degree in which they 
center in the production of good habits of thinking. While we 
may speak, without error, of the method of thought, the impor- 
tant thing is that thinking is the method of an ‘educative expe- 
rience. The essentials of method are therefore identical with the 
essentials of reflection. They are, first, that the pupil have a 
genuine situation of experience—that there be a continuous activ- 
ity in which he is interested for its own sake; secondly, that a 
genuine problem develop within this situation as a stimulus to 
thought; third, that he possess the information and make the 
observations needed to deal with it; fourth, that suggested solu- 
tions occur to him which he shall be responsible for developing in 
an orderly way; fifth, that he have opportunity and occasion to 
test his ideas by application to make their meaning clear and to 
discover for himself their validity.t 
The reasoning of children. Very young children, 
according to Thorndike, “not only possess the requisite 
elementary mental processes involved in reasoning, but 
  
1Democracy and Education, page 191. 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE PRINCIPLES OF METHOD | 115 
also the interest in reasoning, but we nip it in the bud by 
neglecting their questions, making them accept mere 
words as explanations, by feeding to them the dry bones 
of mathematics and grammar, by teaching them to accept 
everything upon authority. It is not the case that the 
interest in reasoning comes late in youth; it comes early, 
but we restrain and dwarf it.”? 
If all elements involved in reasoning are present, why 
do not young children reason as adults do? The answer 
to this question is that they do reason in the same way, 
using the same general processes. The following exam- 
ples? show children reasoning in the same general way as 
adults : 
(2 yrs.) . pulled hairs on father’s wrist. Father: “Don’t T., 
you hurt papa.” T7:: “It didn’t hurt grandpa.” 
(2 yrs., 5 mos.) “M. said: “Gracie can’t walk; she wears little bits 
of shoes; if she had mine she could walk. When f get new 
ones, I’m going to give her these, so she can walk.” 
(2 yrs., 9 mos.) He usually has a nap in the forenoon, but Fri- 
day he did not seem sleepy, so his mother did not put him to 
bed. Before long he began to say: “Billy’s sleepy; mamma 
put him in the erib.” This he said very pleasantly at first, but 
as she paid no attention to him, he said, “Billy ery, then 
mamma will.” And he sat on the floor and roared. 
(3 yrs.) It was between five and six in the afternoon, the mother 
was getting the baby asleep. J. had no one to play with. He 
kept saying, “I wish R. would come home; mamma, put baby 
to bed, so R. will come home.” I usually get home about six, 
and as the baby is usually put to bed about half-past five, he 
associated the one with the other. 
(3 yrs.) W. likes to play with oil paints. Two days ago my 
father told W. he must not touch the paints any more, for he 
was too small. This morning W. said: “When my papa is a 
very old man, and when I am a big man, and don’t need any 
papa, then I can paint, can’t I, mamma?”

  116 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
(3 yrs.) B. climbed up into a large express wagon, and would 
not get out. I helped him out, and it was not a minute before 
he was back in the wagon. I said, “B., how are you going to 
get out of there now?” He replied, “I can stay here till it gets 
little, and then I can get out my own self.” 
(3 yrs.) J. is not allowed to go to the table to eat unless she 
has her face and hands washed and her hair combed. The 
other day she went to a lady visiting at her house, and said, 
“Please wash my face and hands, and comb my hair; I am very 
hungry.” 
(3 yrs.) If C. is told not to touch a certain thing, that it will 
bite him, he always asks if it has a mouth. The other day he 
was examining a plant to see if it had a mouth. He was told 
not to break it, and he said, “Oh, it won’t bite, because I can’t 
find any mouth.” 
Very young children undoubtedly reason, but from sev- 
eral causes they do not reason well. Among these Thorn- 
dike lists the following : 
They haven’t the necessary data. The right ideas are not 
present, and so cannot operate. Wrong ideas come up and are 
accepted because the other ideas which would show them to be 
wrong are not present. Again, children have not learned to look 
for the essential part in anything they are thinking about. They 
have not learned to break the total fact up into its parts and 
make use of the part that concerns their purpose. Nor have 
they had opportunities in most cases to learn what the essentials 
are. All things are to them much like what a game of chess is 
to the beginner. He cannot reason out the best move to make, 
because he does not see the essential element in the situation of 
the pieces, has not learned what the essential elements are in the 
various conditions of the game. He reacts to the whole thing 
roughly, or to some feature which for his purpose is unimportant, 
and so blunders. . . . Within the limits of our capacities we 
reason as much as it pays us to do. Where we can comfortably 
follow habit or example or rote memory, we do. Now children 
may, as is the case with some adults, have the capacity for reason- 
ing, but be infrequent reasoners because it does not pay them to 
reason.

THE PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 117 
Creating an interest in reasoning and thinking. Thorn- 
dike suggests the following means of creating an interest 
in reasoning and thinking: 
By making happiness, esteem, and the other factors of childish 
success depend more on their reasoning out their little problems 
for themselves and less on mere docility, we would create in 
children an interest in such thinking. By preparing them earlier 
for the freedom of action they will at adolescence demand, we 
could make boys attain more gradually the habits of independent 
thought which go with it. By encouraging independence in choice 
in girls we would reduce the difference in zeal for reasoning 
between them and boys. By hastening the acquisition of the 
tools of the intellectual life, or giving side by side with them 
interesting data for thought, we would find younger children 
more zealous in reasoning than might now be thought possible.t 
In the training of thinking the classroom should be a 
place where pupils experiment with meanings. The 
teacher presents the facts, but all the intellectual proc- 
esses should be gone into by the pupils. The only justi- 
fication for the teaching of any subject is to make it the 
means for the child to reorganize his experiences and 
thus widen his outlook on life. Unless an individual has 
developed proper habits of thinking and has learned to 
appreciate open-mindedness and tentative- judgments, he ~ 
cannot grow, and his life will be shut in by narrow boun- 
daries of prejudice, ignorance, and selfishness. 
Questions and Problems 
1. What is the difference between method and device? 
2. Is there any difference in the educative value of teaching 
a boy the knack of raising cabbages and of teaching him the 
principles of plant growth? Justify your answer. 
3. What three factors should determine the method of 
teaching? In some cases what actually does determine the 
method of teaching?

4. If thinking causes the pupil to differ from the teacher, 
to what extent should thinking be encouraged in the classroom? 
5. Give an instance in which a teacher caused you to do 
some real thinking.

teaching each different subject? 
8. Recall the way you were taught geography or history in 
the elementary school. Did the method agree with the point of 
view of this chapter? How did it differ? 
9. Do the pupils in the elementary school do more thinking 
and reasoning out of school than in? Along what lines? Why? 
10. Why do college students, apparently desirous of get- 
ting an education, seem to be happy when the instructor fails 
to appear at the class hour? 
11. Has the teacher completed his work when he has taught 
the child how to read and write and figure? What is the defect 
of this method of teaching?

CLASSROOM PRACTICE 
THE QUESTION As A Factor In TEACHING 
The function of the question. The efficiency of a school 
must be measured by the efficiency of its classroom prac- 
tice. The school life centers around the recitation, and 
questions and answers make up the greater part of the 
recitation period. One writer states that at least eight- 
tenths of the school time is occupied with questions and 
answers. One of the most important phases of the teach- 
ing process is the art of questioning, and the art of ques- 
tioning well is a high attainment.’ 
‘When we find a true teacher at work in a classroom, we - 
generally discover that he is using the question and 
answer recitation for a distinct educational purpose. 
He seeks through a series of skillful questions to draw forth 
from his pupils certain groups of facts related or unrelated; he 
then gives the pupil the incentive to assort his facts and put them 
together in new relations, converting them into potential factors in 
his experience; he helps him to make over a mass of dry facts 
into living knowledge. The mechanical teacher seeks in his 
questioning merely to drive home a certain daily assortment of 
facts gleaned from the perusal of the textbook lesson. The 
teacher who is a master of the art of questioning knows how, by 
the use of the right question in the right place, to teach his 
pupils to acquire and classify knowledge. If he is not a master 
of the art, if he cannot himself be clear and logical in his ques- 
tioning, he fosters in his pupils negative habits of work, poor 
associations, and careless impressions.t

A study of the questioning activity of classes. Miss 
Stevens made a series of ten studies in order to deter- 
mine the questioning activity of particular classes 
throughout an entire school day. In each observation the 
class was accompanied from the hour of assembly to the 
time of dismissal and the questioning activity was min- 
utely recorded. The results are shown below in five of 
the studies made :*

In commenting on the results of her study, Miss Stevens 
Says: 
In this series of ten observations the average number of ques- 
tions for a day’s activity is 395. I have no doubt that if any one 
of these classes had been followed for a period of one week or 
longer, the average would have remained practically the same, 
a little higher or a little lower. It would not help us to know the | 
absolute accuracy of the figure even if it were possible to secure 
it. What we do need to know is the direction in which our pres- 
ent practice is drifting, and the pace it is assuming. Considering 
that children in our schools are regularly held by our teachers, 
collectively, to a performance of something like four hundred 
questions and four hundred answers in one day, and something 
like four hundred questions and four hundred answers the next 
day, and so on, we have in this situation alone a rather significant 
factor to reckon with in estimating standards of classroom effi- 
ciency.1 
The effect of a large number of questions. In discuss- 
ing the large number of questions asked during the reci- 
tation period Miss Stevens lists the following charac- 
  
The Question as a Measure of Eficiency in Instruction, page 15.
-P-A-G-E-141
  CLASSROOM PRACTICE 193 
teristies of such a recitation:! First, the large number of 
questions in the classroom for a considerable time causes 
a high-strung nervous tension where there should be nat- 
ural and normal conditions. Second, the large number of 
questions suggests that the teacher is doing a large part 
of the work instead of the pupils. One reason why one 
hundred fifty questions can be asked in forty minutes is 
due to the fact that the teacher can think more rapidly 
and talk more rapidly than the pupils, and in order to 
cover a large amount of subject-matter he carries the 
train of the lesson through his questions, the pupils 
merely punctuating the series with short answers from 
the text. Third, the large number of questions suggests 
that whenever teachers, either individually or collectively, 
preserve such a pace for any length of time, the largest 
educational assets that can be collected are verbal mem- 
ory and superficial judgment. It is quite obvious that 
with the rapid fire metiod of questioning there is no time 
. allowed a pupil to go very far afield in his experiences 
in order to renew or to associate ideas in fruitful ways. 
Fourth, the large number of questions suggests that there 
is no time in the mechanics of a schoolroom to cultivate 
the gentle art of expression. The only way to develop 
powers of speech 1s to give opportunity for their exercise 
under skilled guidance. When the day’s work is so 
largely given over to rapid questioning, there is no time 
for niceties of speech. Fifth, the large number of ques- 
tions suggests that there is little thought given to the 
needs of individuals. The teacher sets the pace in his 
questions, tue pupils follow as a body, or fall at the way- 
side. Sixth, the large number of questions suggests that 
we are coming more and more to make the classroom the 
place for displaying knowledge instead of a laboratory 
IQpus civ., pages 27-26, ;

  124 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
for getting and using it. Seventh, the large number of 
questions suggests that in actual practice there is very 
little real effort put forth to teach boys and girls to be 
self-reliant, independent mental workers. There is no 
time to teach them how to study, how to organize subject- 
matter, how to judge the relative worth of facts, and what 
to memorize. 
A study of memory and thought-provoking questions. 
Miss Stevens made a further study! of the proportion of 
memory and thought-provoking questions. The results 
are shown in the table below:

This table reveals some interesting facts concerning the 
quantity and quality of questions. We may find in a 
lesson a relatively small number of questions and a com- 
paratively high percentage of pupil activity and still very 
little attention being given to the actual growth and 
development of the pupils. This fact is illustrated in 
  
4The Question as a Measure of Efficiency in Instruction, page 47.
-P-A-G-E-143
  CLASSROOM PRACTICE 125 
Lesson Number 2 where we find 66 questions asked and 
60 of these memory questions based directly upon repeti- 
tion of the text material. Lesson Number 6 also illustrates 
a relatively small number of questions and a comparatively 
high percentage of pupil activity, and yet we find that 61 
were memory questions with only 13 belonging to the 
class of questions that stimulate reflection and make pos- 
sible an intellectual growth. Lesson Number 3 is an 
example of a high type of classroom exercise: a relatively 
small number of questions (69), a very few memory ques- 
tions (39), and 30 thought-provoking questions. Lesson 
Number 5 also ranks well with a total number of ques- 
tions (73), memory work reduced to 33 questions, and 
40 thought-provoking questions. 
Additional studies in questioning. In a survey of 
Publie School Number 188, New York City, made by the 
Bureau of Municipal Research, one of the most important 
summaries is the following: “In 18 recitations there were 
662 questions of what, when, and where, and only 162 of 
how and why. And the teachers did most of the thinking 
for the pupils, for the number of words in the teachers’ 
questions, as compared with the number in the pupils’ 
answers, was a ratio of 3% to 1.” 
In the Springfield, Illinois, survey, in 684 classroom 
visits made by Doctor Ayres and his staff, it was deter- 
mined that in “eight out of each ten rooms the questions 
were predominantly of such a nature that the pupils 
could answer them only by stating facts or giving definite 
textbook information, and in five out of each ten rooms 
these fact answers consisted mainly of single words.” 
“All these records,” says Dr. Ayres, “point in the same 
direction. They indicate that the work of the teachers 
consists in hearing pupils recite facts from the textbooks, 
while the sort of teaching that is of the greatest value is 
the sort that teaches the children to think.”
-P-A-G-E-144
  
126 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
In the Portland, Oregon, school survey we find the fol- 
lowing summary concerning the instruction there: 
The teaching is bookish, and consists of unreasoning memoriz- 
ing. No suggestion or connection is made between the book 
statements and the pupil’s own immediate observation. Even 
home geography is conducted from a book, and such questions 
were asked as, ‘Where is air?? ‘What is moving air called? 
‘What heats the air? These questions are answered fairly well, it 
is true, by memorized hollow-word answers. Such questions indi- 
eate that the chief purpose of teaching is to pass the formal 
_ term examinations, as was shown by a careful scrutiny of the file 
of questions used in these examinations. 
\_-Three qualities of a good question. In estimating the 
( quality of a good question there are at least three things 
that we need to know: the amount of reflection it stimu- 
lates; how well it is adapted to the experience and the 
ability of the pupil; and to what extent it brings forth a 
complete well-rounde? thought on the part of the pupil. 
A. good question should be thought-provoking and stimu- 
late reflection. The difficulty with much of our everyday 
practice is that so many questions furnish exercises for 
mere verbal memory. To what absurdities such training 
may lead is exemplified in the following anecdote told by 
Horace Mann: 
It recently happened, in a school within my own knowledge, 
that a class of small scholars in geography, on being examined 
respecting the natural divisions of the earth—its continents, 
oceans, gulfs, ete.—answered all the questions with admirable 
precision and promptness. They were then asked, by a visitor, 
some general questions about their lesson, amongst others, whether 
they had ever seen the earth about which they had been reading; 
and they unanimously declared in good faith that they never had. 
A question might be a good one for one group of chil- 
dren and a very poor one for another group of children. 
  
43Quoted by Bode, B. H., in Fundamentals of Education, pages 141-42,
-P-A-G-E-145
CLASSROOM PRACTICE 127 
To be a good question, it must be closely related to the 
experience of the learner; otherwise it cannot promote 
profitable reflection and thinking. And finally, a good 
question should draw forth a well-rounded thought. 
Careless and inaccurate answers aye frequently accepted 
by teachers. Such questions as “Tell me all about this or 
that” cannot be expected to bring forth well-rounded 
answers on the part of the pupil. If the school is to 
develop good habits of thinking on the part of its pupils, 
then there must be many thought-provoking questions 
introduced into the daily class exercises ; especially is this 
true if our pupils are ever to grow and develop into intel- 
ligent members of society. 
Examples of good and bad questions. The following 
questions are typical of the large number of memory 
questions asked by the average teacher: 
Name ten of the Southern States and their capitals. 
Name four agricultural products of the Southern States. 
Name two important things mined in the South. 
Name five semitropical fruits raised in Florida. 
What great industry is carried on in Texas? 
From what two sources do we obtain sugar? Por wpe 
To this type of question you either know or do not 
know the answer. No amount of thinking or reflection 
will produce the fact if it is not already in memory. 
These questions stimulate memory, which has its proper 
place in the learning process, but the elements of reason- 
ing are not present as they are in the following group: 
1. How did the Civil War affect manufacturing in the South- 
ern States? a 
2. Why will the United States probably manufacture more of 
the cotton raised here this year than in years past? 
3. If you were a lumberman would you rather work in a south- 
ern or a northern forest? Why? 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
128 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION ‘ 
_4, Why is the grass of the Kentucky Blue Grass region so 
nourishing for stock? 
5. Why do so few immigrants settle in the South? 
In the first group of questions the teacher evidently 
considers the textbook as a catechism and the class exer- 
cises merely as an instrument to test the amount of infor- 
mation memorized by the pupil. This type of question 
develops no initiative, no creative thinking, no organization 
of subject-matter on the part of the child. This purely 
fact teaching no doubt sends a large number of children 
out of the school at the end of the fifth and sixth year 
because of the lack of interest. The second group of 
questions shows that the teacher thinks of the textbook 
as a tool for the pupil. Facts are considered necessary, 
but the teacher considers them only a means, not an end 
in themselvyes—a means of creating a fuller significance 
for the facts of life. Conclusions are called for which 
cannot be found ready-made in the text. It is also 
evident that the teacher considers it his duty to develop 
in the children the power to work out solutions and to 
train them to think for themselves. This type of question 
develops the pupil’s capacity for thinking, and without 
this thought stimulus there is no real thinking or 
teaching. 
The practical possibility and desirability of the use of 
thought-provoking questions in leading children to do 
constructive thinking should be fairly obvious from the 
foregoing discussion.

Typrs or TEACHING 
‘Strdyer and Engelhardt in The Classroom Teacher* dis- 
cuss three major types of: teaching: reasoning, apprecia- 
tion, skill and habit formation. Since the aim of educa- 
tion is to bring about the largest possible growth in 
knowledge, ideals, and skills, and since the school is: 
judged on the type of intellect, character, and skill devel- 
oped, we can readily see the necessity of emphasizing 
these three major types. of teaching. 
A classification of six types of teaching. Stevenson* has 
made an examination of the types of teaching now in 
common use and gives us the following: questions, topics, 
problems, drills, applications, and projects. Under the 
question type are listed detailed, memory, topical, and 
thought questions. As examples of detailed and memory 
questions Stevenson cites the following: 
1. How many states are included in the northeastern section? 
2. What mountain ranges traverse the northwestern part of 
. the section? 
3. What sections are suited to agriculture? Why? 
Examples of topical questions: 
1. What are the surface characteristics of the northeastern 
group of states? Why? 
2. What are the chief occupations of this section? Why? 
The following is quoted as an example of thought~ ques-. 
tions: “To what extent can the industries, occupations,

and locations of cities of New England be accounted for 
by its surface conditions?” The topical questions given 
above illustrate the topic method of teaching. The 
problem type of teaching includes the characteristics of a 
problem as stated by Dewey: “the need of clearing up 
confusion, of straightening out ambiguity, of overcoming 
an obstacle, of covering the gap between things as they 
are and as they may be when transformed.” Under the 
drill type are listed tests and reviews. Under application 
are included illustrations, demonstrations, and experi- 
ments. 
Stevenson’ considers the project to be a distinct type 
of teaching and defines it as “a problematic act carried 
to completion in its natural setting.” He interprets 
natural setting to mean that the solutions undertaken in 
school are no different because they are school problems 
than they would be were they to come up in life outside 
of school. If the solution is carried on in the same way in 
school as it would be carried on in life outside of school, 
then the problem has a natural setting and becomes a 
project.

The activities of the teacher and the pupil may be further 
classified into four types: constructive, appreciative, intel- 
lectual, skill- and habit-forming. According to Kilpatrick, 
there are four types of purposive activities or projects: 
Type 1, where the purpose is to embody some idea or plan in 
external form, as building a boat, writing a letter, presenting a 
play; type 2, where the purpose is to enjoy some (aesthetic) expe- 
rience, as listening to a story, hearing a symphony, appreciating 
a picture; type 3, where the purpose is to straighten out some 
intellectual difficulty, to solve some problem, as to find out whether 
or not dew falls, to ascertain how New York outgrew Philadel- 
phia; type 4, where the purpose is to obtain some item or degree 
of skill or knowledge, as learning to write grade 14 on the 
Thorndike Scale, learning the irregular verbs in French. 
It should be remembered that any classification of the 
types of teaching is purely arbitrary and exists for the 
purpose of convenience. It is evident ‘that these various 
types of teaching will more or less overlap, and the use 
of any one type is determined largely by the aim, or the 
purpose to be accomplished. In any given lesson several 
different types may be involved, as for example: A 
teacher may impart a certain amount of knowledge or 
information, and then develop an appreciation of this 
‘knowledge, and finally attempt to make this knowledge 
permanent through drill and review. 
Tus Prosect Meruop or TEACHING 
At the present time there is no commonly accepted 
definition of the project method. Educational writers 
attempting to define it fall into two distinct classes. One 
group gives a narrow interpretation of the term and the 
other applies it more broadly. The first group thinks of 
the project as a distinct kind of teaching, especially   
1feachers College Bulletin, October, 1918, page 16.
-P-A-G-E-152
  182 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
adapted to constructive or manual activity, a new type 
of teaching to be added to the already existing types. The 
second group of writers thinks of the project method as a 
relatively inclusive concept of teaching; an attempt to 
unify our scattered notions about learning and teaching. 
They consider it more as a series of principles based upon 
a sound educational philosophy and psychology, which 
will apply to almost any type of teaching. 
A narrow interpretation of the project method. As 
representative of the first group, the following quota- 
tions illustrate the narrow interpretation of the project 
method. Snedden’s description of the term project is a 
good illustration of the narrower interpretation : 
A few years ago some of us began using the word project to 
describe a unit of educative work in which the most prominent 
feature was some form of positive and conerete achievement. The 
baking of a loaf of bread, the making of a shirtwaist, the raising 
of a bushel of corn, the making of a table, the installation of an 
electric bell outfit—all these, when undertaken by learners, and 
when so handled as to result in a large acquisition of knowledge 
and experience, were called projects.t 
According to Wilson: 
A project is something to be done requiring constructive or 
ereative ability. It may be manual, and this is the original and 
best type of project work, such as making a library table or rais- 
ing a field of corn. To be a project it must be based upon a 
problem involving study and learning and be carried through to 
completion in a way to answer the questions involved in the 
original problem or problems. But there may be projects in sub- 
jects like history or geography upon the problem type of mate- 
rial, but not involving manual doing. The doing, in this case, 
would be such as organizing or carrying on a state senate or a 
constitutional convention. But there must be doing of a con- 
structive or creative type.?

Parker says: 
The central element in project teaching is the planning by 
pupils of some practical activity, something to be done. Hence, 
a pupil-project is any unit of activity that makes the pupils 
responsible for such practical planning. It gives them practice 
in devising ways and means and in selecting and rejecting meth- 
ods of achieving some definite practical end. This conception 
conforms with the dictionary definition of a project as “some- 
thing of a practical nature thrown out for the consideration of 
its being done” and with the dictionary statement that “to project” 
means “to contrive, to devise, to scheme.” Furthermore, it de- 
scribes with considerable precision a specific kind of improved 
teaching that has become common in progressive experimental 
schools since 1900. . . . Project teaching, when conceived as the 
pupil-planning of practical activities, is clearly a subdivision of 
the larger topic, problem solving. In project teaching, the pupil 
is always confronted with some problem, but a problem of prac- 
tical character, as distinguished from merely theoretical or specu- 
lative problems. Thus, a practical project problem in history 
might be, “How shall we dramatize the life of Washington and 
his troops at Valley Forge?”; while a theoretical problem would 
be, “Who was the greater general, Washington or Frederick the 
Great?” 
A broad interpretation of the project method. There 
is a broader interpretation of the project method, which 
we shall now discuss. A study of the fundamental prin- 
ciples underlying the project will show that the method is 
not new, but is a product of evolution. It is an attempt 
to utilize direct interests and purposeful activities in the 
educative process; to emphasize a neglected factor in the 
teaching process—the attitude of the learner. In any 
teaching process there are at least three major factors: 
the subject-matter, the method, and the learner. These 
three factors are of equal importance, and any attempt to 
subordinate or lose sight of any of them is unjustifiable 
“Project Teaching,” Elementary School Journal, Vol. XXII, pages 035-45.
-P-A-G-E-154
134 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
in the light of our modern knowledge of educative meth- 
ods. When we consider the learner as an important fac- 
tor in the teaching process, then we begin to eliminate 
certain phases of our traditional subject-matter and 
change our method of teaching. Much has been elim- 
inated from physiology, arithmetic, and grammar because 
we could not adapt certain topics to the individual or 
social needs of the learner. In the teaching of penman- 
ship we have changed our method and said good-by to 
the old-fashioned copybook; in spelling we have cut our 
word list from 10,000 to 3000 or 4000 words; and chil- 
dren today are no longer taught to read by the A B C 
method. 
The project method aims to present in school problems 
not different from those in life; to make it impossible for 
the child to live two distinct lives, one in school and the 
other out; to prevent subject-matter from being isolated 
from the situations requiring its use. The need for train- 
ing in thinking is doubtless one of the causes for the 
present interest in the project method. The movement in 
the direction of the project method is a protest against 
the traditional type of teaching which consists largely 
of mere memorizing on the part of the pupil and “pouring 
in” on the part of the teacher. 
Kilpatrick’ interprets the project as referring “to any 
kind or variety of life experience which is in fact act- 
uated by a dominating purpose.” According to this inter- 
pretation, the attitude of the learner determines whether 
or not an activity is a project. The essence of a project is 
an effective dominating purpose. 
Education based on purposeful activities and direct 
interests prepares best for life and at the same time con- 
stitutes worthy living itself. The worthy life consists of 
  
1Teachers Oollege Record, Vol. XXII, page 283.
-P-A-G-E-155
  CLASSROOM PRACTICE ~ 135 
purposeful activity and not mere drifting; or as Kilpat- 
rick says: 
We scorn the man who passively accepts what “fate” or mere 
chance brings to him. We admire the man who is master of his 
fate, who with deliberate regard for a total situation forms clear 
and far-reaching purposes, who plans and executes with nice care 
the purposes so formed. A man who habitually so regulates his 
life with reference to worthy social aims meets at once the de- 
mands for practical efficiency and of moral responsibility. Such 
a one presents the ideal of democratic citizenship. . . . If the 
purposeful act be in reality the typical unit of the worthy life, 
then it follows that to base education on purposeful acts is exactly 
to identify the process of education with worthy living itself. The 
two become then the same. 
Individual and group projects. In an individual project. 
the undertaking is a result of the purposing of one person 
who feels the need of solving the problem and is directly 
interested in it; who devises, evaluates, and executes the 
plans necessary for the attainment of the end or the pur- 
pose. Individual projects may be found in an arithmetic 
class when a pupil sees a real vital need for learning cer- 
tain number combinations in order to participate in a 
game; or when a boy feels a real need to know certain 
facts in order to take his position as cashier in the school 
savings bank or as treasurer of some of the school organi- 
zations. An individual project may be found in the English 
class when the pupil feels a real vital need for learning to 
correct certain of his language errors. Individual projects 
are found in any class where the pupil feels a real need, a 
dominating purpose, for solving the problems presented. 
In a group or class project several unite in a common 
purpose, and we have a purposing group who devise, 
evaluate, and execute the plans necessary for the attain- 
ment of the end or purpose. <A true group project is

found where all the members of a group or class have a 
dominant purpose and a direct interest in the process as 
well as the outcome. The present tendency seems to be 
to emphasize group projects in the classroom. They pre- 
sent a splendid opportunity to teach boys and girls how 
to work together and to share each other’s purposes and 
problems. The group projects also present opportunities 
for leadership and coéperation. Pupils learn to become 
leaders and at other times to subordinate themselves in 
the attainment of a common purpose or end. The follow- 
ing is an example of a group project in dramatization and 
reading: 
A Group Progect in DrAMATIZATIONt 
The fourth grade read the story, “Proserpina or the Pome- 
granate Seeds.” The motive for the reading was the pupils’ de- 
sire to find a story which they might dramatize for the Training 
School assembly. 
After reading the story the pupils decided that it could be 
used. They then started the writing of the play as group work. 
They used parts of the conversation in the “reader,” but where 
the action was carried along by narration the pupils provided 
conversation for the actors. Sometimes four or five paragraphs, 
differing somewhat, were suggested by pupils. All paragraphs 
were written on the board and the childrei Y read the conversation 
immediately preceding and judged which was the best. A selec- 
tion was made by vote of the class. In this work.the pupils eriti- 
cized sentence structure and choice of words. As the play was 
written scene by scene the pupils copied it. Here was given an 
opportunity to teach the use of capital letters, periods, question 
marks, exclamation points, quotation marks, and margins. 
The pupils had had some previous study of the Greek gods and 
goddesses. Because of this the story in the reader was changed 
somewhat by having Ceres go to Mt. Olympus to ask Father Zeus 
  
1This project was worked out under the direction of Mrs. Susan Van Meter, 
Fourth Grade Training Teacher, Colorado State Teachers College.
-P-A-G-E-157
CLASSROOM PRACTICE 137 
to help her find Proserpina. This gave an opportunity to put 
into the play many of the gods and goddesses. 
After the play was written, each child had his copy, and the 
play was then used as a reading lesson. The motive for this was 
to get a clear idea of the play as a whole. 
Then came the “try outs.” Each child chose the part he 
wanted to “try out” for. The class voted for the one they thought 
best. Those who did not have speaking parts chose what other 
roles they wanted. Two pupils chose to pull the curtains and to 
be property men.rather than act in any of the scenes. 
After the pupils knew their parts the next step was to have 
practice on the stage. This brought up the question of what set- 
tings were needed, and the pupils suggested what would be suit- 
able. The stage settings were worked out in the art periods. 
In order to decide how the characters were to be costumed, 
books containing pictures of Greek gods and mythical characters 
were brought to the Training School from the main library. A 
pupil looked in the index to find the character he represented, and 
from the text and the pictures he decided what he needed to wear. 
This group project began with a conscious setting up 
of an end or purpose, and presented many difficulties 
which the group set out to remove. Devising, evaluating, 
and executing plans made possible the removing of the 
difficulties and the attainment of the end. One of the 
major problems was to provide conversation where the 
action was carried along by narration. This involved the 
selection and elimination of various contributions made 
by the members of the class. The selection of characters, 
costumes, and stage settings provided additional oppor- 
tunity for the evaluation and execution of plans which 
made possible the goal or purpose. The knowledges, 
skills, and attitudes developed during the undertaking 
were of real educative value, for they were used in the 
solution of a life problem. The children received splen- 
did drill in penmanship, spelling, oral and written lan- 
guage, for these were so naturally related to the problem 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
1388 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
as to require no artificial motivation or incentive. This 
project also made it possible for the children to enlarge 
their experience by coming naturally in contact with 
many different source-books, references, pictures, ete. Per- 
haps one of the outstanding characteristics of the project 
was the fact that it provided for a group codperative 
enterprise having real social significance. 
The utilization of the interests of children. While the 
project method is an attempt to utilize direct interests 
and whole-hearted purposes of the child, it should not be 
forgotten that all the purposes and interests of the child 
are not of the same educative value. Therefore it is the 
duty of the teacher to select those purposes which have 
the greatest educative worth. An interest or purpose is 
of educative value just to the extent that it develops 
higher levels of interests; just to the extent that it lends 
a greater significance to the facts of everyday living. 
Some interests may lead to almost nothing of value. 
The child expresses many interests which, if indulged, 
may result in bad habits and undesirable attitudes. 
We are all agreed that when the child’s interests 
interfere with the welfare of others and of himself they 
must be checked. The real function of a teacher is to 
assist the child in conceiving and selecting worthy pur- 
poses for, as Kilpatrick says: 
If the guidance is wise, the child should increasingly come to 
weigh the consequence of his contemplated acts and to choose in 
the light of proper considerations, moral or prudential, as the 
ease may be. In this way freedom is to be a gradual achieve- 
ment, free choice and responsibility being more frequently ac- 
corded as increasing age and growth show their proper exercise 
to be feasible.t 
1[he Project Method, page 317.  
-P-A-G-E-159
  
CLASSROOM PRACTICE 139 
The curriculum and the project method. The cur- 
riculum is made up of materials which adults assume to 
be of permanent worth, but the difficult problem is for 
the teacher to present them in such a way as to make the 
child realize their worth or value. According to the old 
disciplinary conception of education, it made little differ- 
ence whether the learner appreciated the value of the 
material or not; even if he did not like it, it was good for 
him. The new “soft pedagogy,” while emphasizing imme- 
diate pleasures, has tended to obscure the necessity of a 
feeling of worth or a sense of values. The former tend- 
ency emphasizes blind conformity and subservience, the 
latter makes the child a creature of every passing whim 
or fancy. 
The project method is an attempt to enable the teacher 
to present his material in such a way that it appeals to the 
learner as having sufficient worth to demand serious 
effort. The child with his limited experience cannot be 
expected to appreciate remote interests; therefore it is 
necessary that the materials first presented shall develop 
from his childish sense of value. But as he grows and 
develops it is foolish to continue forever to treat him as 
if he could not by any possibility distinguish between 
immediate and somewhat remote interests. As a matter 
of fact, the real growth and development of the child will 
depend upon his ability to appreciate remote interests. 
Some possible advantages of the project method. The 
project method should react favorably on the course of 
study, eliminating much that is formal and abstract. It 
should emphazise the material that can be made a part 
of the experience of the child and that will make provi- 
sion for securing a progressive enrichment of life. Here  
-P-A-G-E-160
140 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
are some of the possible advantages of the project 
method: 
1. Creates enthusiasm and interest in school work. * 
2. Develops a sense of responsibility on the part of pupils. 
3. Enables pupils to see the reason, aim, or purpose of doing 
things. 
4. Encourages open-mindedness and independent thinking. 
5. Unifies school life with real life. 
6. Provides an opportunity for team work, and group co- 
6peration through class discussions, debates, reports, and experi- 
ments. 
7. Supplements the textbook by use of reference books, bulle- 
tins, magazines, newspapers, ete. 
_ 8. Utilizes purposes, interests, and previously acquired expe- 
riences of the pupil. 
9. Develops pupil ability in conceiving and selecting worthy 
purposes. 
10. Presents subject-matter so that it appeals to the learner 
as having sufficient worth to demand serious effort. 
Tue Maxine or Lesson PLans 
In classroom practice there are three major questions 
confronting every teacher: What is to be taught? How 
is it to be taught? Why is it to be taught? Daily prep- 
aration and systematic lesson planning are essential to 
efficient teaching. Many teachers fail because they do 
not determine in advance of their recitations just what 
they are going to do or how they are going to do it. 
The lesson plan is a device to secure a systematic, defi- 
nite preparation and thorough organization of the lesson 
before the recitation. The form given below is merely 
suggestive, for the teacher should be free to bend the 
device to the purpose it is intended to serve. A plan may 
be a help or a hindrance according to the way it is used. 
If the teacher mechanically follows the plan, disregard- 
ing the needs of the class—the unexpected knowledge or   
      
   
-P-A-G-E-161
  CLASSROOM PRACTICE 141 
lack of knowledge shown, and the questions asked—the 
plan becomes an obstacle to really vital teaching. 
Steps In Puanninea A Lesson 
I. Preparatory step. 
1. Former ideas and activities which serve as an introduc- 
tion to the new topic or problem. Related ideas recalled 
to form the base for the understanding of the new 
knowledge or experience to be formed. 
(a) Questions, conversation, or review of former activi- 
ties to help the pupil recall or reorganize previous 
ideas or experiences which are necessary as a basis 
for the new knowledge and experience. 
2. The preparatory step, which should lead the class to 
desire the new work, and out of which should come the 
aim or problem. 
II. Problem presented. 
1. The specific purpose to be accomplished through the 
subject-matter or material involved. 
2. Location of the pupil’s aim or problem through the dis- 
covery of the center of his interests and through the 
bringing of his need to a focus. 
3. Discovery of the means of making pupils conscious of 
the problem or the end for which they are to work. 
III. Methods. 
1. Means by which the teacher proposes to accomplish the 
aim or solve the problem. 
2. Means by which pupils will gain and organize the new 
knowledge and experience. 
(a) Subject-matter, illustrations, review, drill, assign- 
ments, questions, motor activities, skill, illustrative 
material, observations, experimentation, reading, 
telling, ete. 
IV. Problems solved or material summarized. 
1. Results which the teacher expects as a consequerice of 
the new topic or problem. 
This lesson plan is not to be thought of as consisting 
of four logically organized steps following each other in
-P-A-G-E-162
142 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
the order named; but rather as the statement and expla- 
nation of four important processes necessary in the plan- 
ning of any lesson. 
Every lesson should have a beginning or introduction, 
and the best way to begin is to recall former ideas and 
activities of the pupils which serve as an introduction, 
a preparatory step, to the new topic or problem to be 
presented. We always interpret the new in terms of the 
old. Through the preparatory step there is developed 
in the pupil a consciousness and a feeling of need for 
the problem or new topic. The introduction to any les- 
son should lead the class to see what needs to be done 
and should develop a real desire on their part to do it. 
The method is not the third step in our lesson plan, but 
rather it is the means by which the teacher conducts the 
lesson. In Chapter VII we learned that method was 
simply the name for the activities engaged in by the 
teacher and the class. Method, then, is the means or the 
way by which the pupils will gain and organize the new 
knowledge or experience which the lesson furnishes; the 
way the teacher selects and organizes the subject-matter 
to be taught; the way he selects and uses the types of 
teaching in handling the subject-matter. The fourth stage 
of the lesson is the end or conclusion. Here we find the 
problem ‘solved or the material summarized—the results 
that the teacher set out to reach. This important step 
enables the teacher to see whether he has succeeded in 
teaching the lesson as he had planned. It enables him to 
evaluate his work and measure the results of his teaching. 
Many teachers merely carry on the classroom activities 
with never an attempt to estimate the effect of their efforts. 
The wise teacher always thoughtfully diagnoses the results 
of his work and devises plans to remedy the weaknesses 
that he finds.

A TENTATIVE OUTLINE FoR PLANNING A Datty Lesson 
What will you teach today? Be specific. Differentiate this 
from all other lessons. 
. What is the function of today’s work? 
1. 
ae As a step in the teaching of the whole unit? 
Aside from this relation, has it any special value? 
What books or other material will be needed? 
How will you teach this subject matter? 
al How will the need for this subject matter or activity be 
developed, or its value made apparent? Suggestive ques- 
tion: In what life situation, real or imagined, can the 
child be placed so that this need or value will develop? 
It must be kept in mind that the children’s interests are 
not confined to the learning of new material. They may 
feel the need of drill so that they may do well what they 
now do imperfectly, or that they may organize knowl- 
edge which they already possess. 
As an outgrowth of the feeling of the need developed 
above, what aim shall the pupils state to guide them. in 
their work? 
What are the main steps in the solution of the problem 
which is before the class? The chief points of apprecia- 
tion in ease the lesson is chiefly for appreciation? 
After the pupils have completed the solution of their 
problem, or after they have had the opportunity to 
appreciate the experience of which this unit of subject 
matter consists, how will the experience just gone 
through be perfected? 
(a) So that it may be remembered? 
(b) So that it may receive the best organization for 
future use? 
This tentative outline for planning a daily lesson shows 
clearly the three major problems in classroom practice 
confronting every teacher. What is to be taught? How 
is it to be taught? Why is it to be taught? The first 
question, “What will you teach today?” emphasizes the 
importance of the teacher’s having a clear idea of the 
problem he is going to present to his class. If you don’t 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
144 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
know where you are going you won’t know how to go; or 
when you get there. And in a like manner, unless the 
teacher knows definitely what he is going to teach, he 
will not know how to teach it or whether he has taught it 
successfully. He cannot evaluate the results of his work. 
The second question, “What is the function of today’s 
work?” emphasizes the important factor, why? Every 
teacher should be able to answer definitely and concretely 
why he is going to teach a given lesson. Will it function 
as a necessary step in the teaching of a whole unit? Does 
it prepare for more complicated work, just as addition 
prepares for multiplication? Will it function in giving 
a fuller significance to the facts of everyday life? Will 
it function in developing a real joy in the doing? Unless 
the teacher knows why he is teaching a lesson, it is very 
doubtful if that lesson will have much significance either 
to the class or to himself. 
Teachers must justify their teaching; there must be a 
reason. Teaching must be justified on sound educational 
grounds, for we can no longer do so on any vague, 
traditional, abstract, or mysterious basis. Much of our 
teaching is based on a kind of “faith.” We don’t know 
just why we are going to teach a lesson, but we hope it 
will do the pupil some good. It may not do him any good, 
we think, but it won’t do any harm. And then there is the 
old disciplinary idea that if we can make the work dis- 
agreeable enough, it will do the boy good. But what 
good? 
Whenever teachers can think of no valid reason why 
they are teaching any given subject, they seek to justify 
themselves on the ground that it will discipline and 
strengthen the mind of the pupil. And yet, if you were 
to ask these teachers what the mind is, and how it works, 
you would probably find that their conception of the mind
-P-A-G-E-165
CLASSROOM PRACTICE 145 wl 
was vague, abstract, mysterious, and contrary to the mod- — 
ern psychological conception. There are a large number 
of teachers who answer the why by saying that it is in the 
textbook. And why is it in the textbook? Because it has 
always been in the textbook. Some teachers are tradi- 
tion-bound and custom-caked. The reasons we give for 
teaching any subject or any particular lesson must be in 
accord with the aims of education, the needs of the child, 
and the nature of the subject-matter. Every teacher must 
therefore have a sound philosophy of education, a sympa- 
thetic working knowledge of the child, and a broad grasp 
and appreciation of the subject he is teaching. 
The third major problem in lesson planning is empha- 
sized in the fourth question, “How will you teach this 
subject-matter?” This is the fundamental problem of 
method which we discussed in Chapter VII. We shall not 
enter into a further discussion of this problem at this time. 
We would suggest that the student read again the sub-topies 
under Question 4 in the tentative outline for planning a 
daily lesson. 
Lesson planning can never safely be discontinued. 
Complete plans are necessary until the technique of teach- 
ing reaches a place where listing of details becomes unnec- 
essary. <A lesson plan should gradually come to consist of 
a statement of the teacher’s aims, a few large topics, and 
the questions which introduce them. 
Questions and Problems 
1. Count the number of questions asked by a teacher during 
a recitation of thirty or forty minutes. What is your con- 
clusion ? 
2. Secure several lists of examination questions and esti- 
mate the percentage of thought-provoking and of memory 
questions.

~ 8. One investigator has found that pupils do better when 
working in groups than when working alone. If these findings 
are generally true, what influence should this have on class- 
room practice? 
4. The function of the school is to impart knowledge and 
information, as the child has plenty of opportunity outside the 
school to develop his social nature. Is this statement reflected 
in any school system with which you are acquainted? Is it in 
accord with the modern conception of the school? Can you 
reconcile the two apparently opposite views of this theory? 
5. Name five characteristics of a good recitation. 
6. Give an illustration of each of the three types of teach- 
ing mentioned by Strayer and Engelhardt (page 129).

CHAPTER IX 
MEASURING IN EDUCATION 
DEVELOPMENT or Exact Units or MEAsuRE 
Exact units of measure are of recent origin; as late as 
1854 an English commission established the yard and 
defined its length as a unit of measure. In spite of the 
newness of exact standards of measurement, today prac- 
tically every phase of economic life is measured. The 
farmer no longer tells you that he thinks his wheat crop 
is better this year than it was last year, but he knows 
exactly in terms of bushels per acre. Certainty has 
replaced guesswork in every line of business. 
Before exact units of measure were determined, all dis- 
tances, weights, and other measurable quantities were 
estimated. The distance between two places was reck- 
oned as so many days’ journey. Shorter distances were 
, designated as cubits, and a cubit was defined as the dis- 
tance between the elbow and the third finger. The width 
of the palm and the length of the pace were also common 
measures. The trouble with all of these units was that 
they varied with different users. The distance between 
two places was not always said to be the same by differ- 
ent travelers. The man with long arms and legs could 
stretch the cubit and the pace to such a length that they 
could not be compared to those of a small man. Conse- 
quently, as civilization advanced it was found necessary 
to have some standards of measure that would be the 
same no matter who used them. It is no longer practical 
149
-P-A-G-E-170
    
150 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
to speak of taking a ‘‘three days’ journey into the wilder- 
ness.’? Houses are not planned to be seven cubits high 
and the real height left to be determined by the length 
of the builder’s arm as a unit of measure. 
One of the last organizations to develop standard 
measures was education. For years it was possible to 
estimate only roughly brightness, dullness, progress, and 
accomplishments. Today, however, a new field is being 
developed in education. It is no longer necessary to 
guess, because units of measure have been worked out. 
There are two separate fields to be dealt with in the dis- 
cussion of measuring in education. One field deals with 
native intelligence, and the other with the products of 
education. They are generally designated as (1) intelli- 
gence tests, and (2) educational tests. Intelligence tests 
are constructed so as to measure native intelligence. Edu- 
cational tests are used to measure the amount of a certain 
subject that has been learned. Intelligence tests help to 
predict the work that can be done. Educational tests 
measure the work that has been done. 
INTELLIGENCE TESTS 
The Binet Test and the Stanford Revision. Binet, a 
French psychologist, made in 1904 the first intelligence 
tests. The method was crude, but it induced other psy- 
chologists to start working in the measurement field. The 
Binet tests were brought to America and revised to meet 
the needs of American children. The chief American re- 
vision was made at Stanford Jr. University by Dr. L. M. 
Terman and his associates. The product of their work is 
known as the Stanford Revision,’ and is the most accu- 
rate instrument for measuring Cee that is avail- 
able at the present time.

  LEWIS MADISON TERMAN 
Lewis Madison Terman is noted as an educa- 
tional psychologist. His greatest contribution 
to the field of education is the Stanford Re- 
vision of the Binet Mental Tests. He was a 
pioneer in the field of mental measurements and 
is still one of its most noted leaders.
-P-A-G-E-172

-P-A-G-E-173
MEASURING IN EDUCATION 151 : 
In a book such as this it is impracticable to attempt to 
describe the Binet method, It should be said, however, 
that the score of the test is expressed as a mental age. If 
a child has a mental age of ten years, it means that he has 
the mental development of an average ten-year-old child. 
Mental age as a unit of measure is very easy to compre- - 
hend. 
Another important measure of the Binet test is the 
Intelligent Quotient (I. Q.), which is the percentage of 
intelligence possessed by the child being measured. If a 
child has a life age of ten years and a mental age of eight 
years, he has an I. Q. of 80. I. Q. is always obtained by 
dividing mental age by life age. A child with a mental 
age of twelve and a life age of eight has an I. Q. of 150. 
Mental age. tells how far the child has developed men- 
tally; I. Q. tells how bright he is. Mental age increases 
as a child matures; I. Q. remains practically constant. If 
a child is bright at eight years, he will still be bright at 
twelve. If a child is feeble-minded while young, he is 
practically certain to be feeble-minded always. 
It has been demonstrated that, other things being 
equal, a child with a high I. Q. does better school work 
than a child of the same age with a low I. Q. It is evi- 
dent, then, that knowing the I. Q. of a child is of great 
‘help in predicting the school progress he should make. 
From the definition of I. Q. it can be seen that if a child 
is normal mentally, his I. Q. should be practically 100. In 
practice, a child is considered normal if his I. Q. falls 
between 95 and 105. Above this mark a child is said to be 
superior, and below, inferior. A child whose I. Q. is 70 
or below is classed as feeble-minded. 
The Stanford Revision must be given by one who is 
thoroughly trained in its manipulation. It must be given 
to one child at a time. It takes about an hour to arrive
-P-A-G-E-174
152 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
at ascore. Hence this is a costly method to use in deter- 
mining the intelligence of a large number of children, but 
it produces results that are accurate and dependable. 
Group intelligence tests. In order to overcome the cost 
of diagnosis with individual tests, group tests have been 
devised. The first group test was constructed by Dr. 
Arthur §. Otis, who was working at that time in the 
Stanford University laboratory. 
The war gave a great impetus to group testing. The 
Psychological Division of the United States Army, created 
during the war, devised the Alpha and the Beta mental 
tests and measured many thousand recruits. The Alpha 
test was made for literates and the Beta for illiterates. 
The results in the army were so satisfactory that since 
the end of the war group testing in education and busi- 
ness has developed at a tremendous rate. At the present 
time there are a large number of group mental tests on 
the market. Some of these tests are for kindergarten 
children, some for the first grade, and many for the ele- . 
mentary grades, junior and senior high school, and col- 
lege students. 
In a book such as this it is inadvisable to present a dis- 
cussion of how these tests are made. It is also inadvisable 
to reproduce any of the material. Those interested in the 
field will find a complete discussion and explanation in 
any modern book on the subject. It is also possible to 
obtain copies of the tests from the various publishing 
companies. It is the purpose of this chapter to give only 
a general idea of this new field and some of the uses of 
results. 
The use of intelligence tests. Intelligence tests have 
pointed out a very bad condition in our schools. When 
these tests are given to all the children in a grade, it is 
found that the mental development varies greatly. In every
-P-A-G-E-175
MEASURING IN EDUCATION 153 
ordinary grade, children are found so immature that the 
work is much too hard for them. The same grade alse 
contains those who are so mature mentally that the work 
is much too easy for them. Of course, there are many 
children in each grade who are getting the type of work 
they can do well. Thus, as a result of these tests it seems 
to be pretty clearly shown that about one-fourth to one-half 
of the children in the average grade, who are trying to do 
the usual work, are unable to master it fully. 
As an attempt at a solution of this problem the sugges- 
tion was made that children should be graded by mental 
age. <A child with a mental age of twelve can do sixth 
grade work. The conclusion was, therefore, that he 
should be in the sixth grade, no matter whether he was 
sixteen years or eight years of age... Hence the proce- 
dure was to test children and then place them in the 
grade that most nearly coincided with their mental age. 
This work helped matters to a certain extent.~ It put 
children into: grades where they could work, and made 
the task of the teacher much easier. However, it devel- 
oped a new problem. It put children of different life 
and social ages together. A child of six, if bright 
enough, would be advanced to the third or fourth grade. 
Here he would associate with a large number of nine- 
year-olds and even with children who were twelve and 
thirteen. It also put children in the senior high school 
at a very early age. A child of ten with an I. Q. of 150 
would, of course, if graded strictly on the mental age 
basis, be put in the tenth grade of the senior high school. 
Promotion on the basis of mental age is now being 
discouraged. It is thought best to keep children of the 
same life and social age rather closely together’ One 
reason why this is necessary is found in the junior high 
school. The basic principle of the junior high school 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
154 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
idea is that it puts children of the adolescent age together. 
If children are graded on mental age only, they will be 
promoted into the junior high school at degrees of maturity 
ranging from pre-adolescence to adolescence already four 
or five years attained. 
At the present time it is thought best to keep children 
of the same life age together. When a large group of 
children enter the first grade, instead of putting the 
brightest immediately into the second grade, it is thought 
best to keep them in the first grade and give them an 
enriched curriculum. A first grade, then, should have 
as many different types of work as there are levels of 
intelligence. This same idea, when carried through the 
other grades, puts all children into the junior high school 
at about the age of twelve. Here the work can still be dif- 
ferentiated according to the types of intelligence. 
An example can be given from a junior high school in 
Denver. ‘A 7B class that entered this junior high school 
was large enough to make seven sections of 7B English. 
Instead of making up these sections in a hit-or-miss . 
fashion, they were made up on the basis of intelligence 
tests. Thirty children who were the brightest were put 
into one group, the thirty dullest into another, and the 
remainder of the children were divided in like manner 
into classes each of uniform intelligence. This classifi- 
cation on the basis of intelligence made it possible to 
vary the work to suit the type of intelligence. Simiiar 
classifications have. ‘been made in Oakland, California, 
Detroit, Michigan, and in many other places. 
The, intelligence tests. are being used widely also in 
colleges and universities. In the Colorado State Teachers 
College students take the Thorndike College Entrance 
Intelligence test. If a student wishes to take more 
than sixteen credit hours per quarter, a superior score
-P-A-G-E-177
MEASURING IN EDUCATION 155 
on the Thorndike test must be made. This has proved 
to be a most satisfactory means of regulating the amount 
of work taken. 
Cautions concerning tests. A large amount of money 
has been wasted in buying and administering intelligence 
tests, because many people have given them who are not 
qualified to interpret the results. . The Stanford Revision 
of the Binet test should never be administered by any- 
one but a trained psychologist or by a teacher who has 
had a thorough course in the giving, scoring, and inter- 
preting of this test. Group intelligence tests’ should 
never be given unless the person in charge has had exten- 
sive training in psychology, particularly in the field of 
mental tests and statistics. 
After the scores have been computed and utilized, the 
teacher must assume a professional attitude toward the 
results. A doctor will not tell a friend the intimate 
details concerning a patient. A banker will not give 
information concerning the amount of money a man has 
on deposit. A lawyer will not discuss with you the legal 
tangle of a client. These are illustrations of profes- 
sional attitudes. The teacher must have the same pro- 
fessional attitude in order to safeguard properly the 
intelligence test results which are available to him. »He 
should never discuss the intelligence of a child with any- 
one except his supervisor or principal. ¢ Children should 
never be informed concerning their mental age or I. Q. 
If these simple rules are observed, more can be done with 
mental tests than is possible to do where no caution is 
taken and where the teachers have no professional ideals. 
EDUCATIONAL TESTS 
Kinds of educational tests. Educational tests are used 
to measure some of the products of education. In the
-P-A-G-E-178
  156 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
past this has been done ineffectively. It is true, that at 
the end of each month the teacher sent to the home a 
ecard showing that the child had made a grade of 82 
in one subject, 92 in another, ete. However, these 
marks were based on unscientific observation. A mark 
of 90 by one teacher might be equal to a mark of 70 
by another, because there was no common basis of agree- 
ment as to what constituted a mark. 
Many teachers do not realize the inaccuracy of school 
gradings, and most teachers do not realize how widely 
they differ from other teachers in the value of a grade. 
In order to demonstrate the truth of this statement to a 
group of teachers, the author of this chapter tried an 
experiment with thirty-three experienced teachers. They 
were gathered together in a summer school class, and all 
of them had taught in the elementary grades during the 
previous year. Most of them stoutly maintained that they 
could mark in percentages, and mark accurately. 
To correct this impression the following experiment 
was tried. The teachers were asked to mark an arith- 
metic examination paper. This paper was written in the 
fourth grade and was selected at random from a large 
number of papers on the same examination. Each 
teacher was asked to read the questions and answers, 
and mark the paper to the best of his ability. Because 
each teacher had been marking arithmetic papers in the 
fourth grade during the year, the experiment evidently 
was a fair one. The results are shown below:

Thus one teacher marked the paper 32 per cent, while 
another marked it 82 per cent, and the other gradings 
were scattered in the whole range between the two 
extremes. Did the pupil pass the examination? It all 
depends on which teacher’s mark was considered just. 
These teachers could measure inches, miles, pounds, or 
quarts with accuracy because they had an exact unit of 
measure. However, they disagreed on the quality of 
arithmetic knowledge shown in a simple paper, because 
of an utter lack of any common standard of judgment. 
If this is true in arithmetic, conditions must be worse 
in other subjects which are less objective and hence far 
more difficult to grade. : 
A large number of studies have been made of school 
‘marks. It is interesting to note that each of these inves- 
tigators has concluded that percentage marks given by 
teachers are very inaccurate. It was in order to over- 
come such inaccuracy of school marks and to guard 
against the inability of teachers to judge the quality of 
work done by a pupil, that educational tests were devised. 
These educational tests measure the child’s knowledge 
of a given subject or his ability to do a certain skillful 
operation. 
The first test was a writing scale made in 1910 by 
Thorndike. Since that time a large number of writing 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  158 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
scales have been made. These are very simple affairs. 
They consist of a number of specimens of writing ar- 
ranged in order of merit. At one end of the scale is 
the best writing, and at the other end the poorest. To 
judge the quality of a child’s writing, the teacher takes 
a sample and determines which specimen the sample most 
resembles in merit. This is the quality rating. If a 
teacher sees on a report card that a child’s writing is 
marked 82 per cent for last month, it means nothing to 
him; but if he sees on the record card that the child was 
writing “Quality 10” on a certain scale, it means a certain 
definite thing. By marking a child’s writing once a 
month it is possible to determine progress as improvement 
_ takes place. The teacher may also get a speed score 
by having the child write a certain known sentence as 
many times as possible in a given time, usually two or 
three minutes. When the teacher knows the speed and 
quality of writing for each child each month, it is pos- 
sible to direct intelligently the writing drill. 
The best known spelling scale was made by Dr. L. P. 
Ayres. This scale is made up of the one hundred most 
common words in the English language. They were 
selected as the result of extensive experiments and were 
arranged in columns containing words of approximately 
equal spelling difficulty. At the top of each column is 
a table giving the percentage that should be correctly 
spelled in each grade. If a teacher wishes to give a 
test, he selects his words from a single column. They are 
then spelled by the children and the results compared 
with the standards. It is thus possible for a teacher to 
know how his grade compares with other grades in spell- 
ing accomplishment. 
The Thorndike-McCall Reading Test is one of the best 
examples of a good reading test. A paragraph is pre-
-P-A-G-E-181
MEASURING IN EDUCATION 159 
sented for the child to read, and a list of questions con- 
cerning the thought of the paragraph is answered. The 
child’s score is based on the number of correct answers 
given. 
Many tests have been made to measure arithmetic. One 
of the earliest and best was made by S. A. Courtis. The 
Courtis tests measure skill in the fundamental operations. 
One test presents a page of addition problems of equal 
difficulty. The child does as many of the problems as he 
can correctly add in a given time. Another page of the 
Courtis test presents subtraction problems of equal diffi- 
culty, and the other two pages deal in the same manner 
with multiplication and division. By the use of this test 
it is possible for a teacher to know the individual differ- 
ences within his class and how the class compares with 
other classes of the same grade in the same and other 
cities. 
The Woody arithmetic scale is based upon a different 
principle. In his scale the addition problems are arranged 
in order of difficulty, the first problem being very easy, 
the next one more difficult, and the other problems 
each increasing in difficulty. A child taking the test 
works the problems until he arrives at those that are too 
difficult for him to solve. The division, multiplication, 
and subtraction problems in the Woody scale are made 
up in like manner. 
Seales have been devised for measuring the product of 
education in practically every elementary and high-school 
subject. The above brief descriptions of the scales used 
in writing, spelling, reading, and arithmetic will illus- 
trate the general principle. The student who wishes 
detailed information concerning these scales, or a list of 
other scales, should consult the references at the end of the 
chapter. 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
160 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
The use of educational tests. The first general prin- 
ciple to be laid down in the use of educational tests is 
that they should be given only when there is a definite 
problem to solve which cannot be better solved by some 
other means. In the past teachers have given educational 
tests merely to satisfy their curiosity. This practice is 
inexcusable. If a teacher wishes to know how his 
children differ or if he wishes to know how his class 
differs from other classes, then there is a real reason 
for giving educational tests. There is only one method 
of determining how much the children in a grade know 
of a given subject and that is to give them a standardized 
test. There is only one method of finding out how much 
of a certain subject is learned in a given time, or how 
much skill has been acquired, and that is to give a test 
at the beginning and at the end of a stated period. 
Through the use of educational tests it is possible to 
compare the work of schools in different parts of the 
country. Until tests were invented it was impossible 
to compare the work in arithmetic being done in Boston 
and Cleveland and in other cities. At the present time 
studies are being made every year in which the average 
scores for the various cities are compared. It was at 
first thought that this was the most important function of 
educational tests; but while it is valuable to know the 
quality of arithmetic work being done in your city and 
how it compares with other cities, it is much more impor- - 
tant to know the individual differences among your 
pupils. 
Educational tests make it possible to compare one grade 
with other like grades throughout. the city. This must 
be done with great care. The children in school A may 
be much more intelligent than those in school B. There- 
fore it is unfair to compare the results of the work done
-P-A-G-E-183

in these two schools. However, when there are two sec- 
tions of the same grade in the same school or where 
two schools have the same type of children, a comparison 
of this sort is not only interesting but sheds valuable 
light on the effectiveness of the teaching being done in 
these grades. 
Educational tests help the teacher to balance his 
time correctly. There are certain traditional programs 
in our schools. In some cities more time is given to 
arithmetic than in other cities. The question that the 
school man must ask himself is, “Is this justifiable?” By 
comparing the results of the arithmetic teaching it is 
possible to arrive at an accurate conclusion. In the Salt 
Lake survey it was found that school children there do 
better work in spelling and arithmetic than in most cities. 
However, the program shows that they are spending an 
excessive amount of time on these subjects. The conclu- 
sion was then reached that, “At least one-fourth more 
time is given to spelling and more than one-fourth more 
to arithmetic than is justified in the light of the best 
knowledge of the subject.” In the same survey it was 
suggested that hardly enough time was devoted to the 
teaching of hygiene, which led to the conclusion that, 
“The results of this rather extreme attention to spelling 
show in a very high score; but it is a question whether 
the children of Salt Lake City are not sacrificing some- 
thing in other lines by devoting so large a proportion of 
the total time available to spelling.” Educational tests 
make such comparison possible. 
The above are but a few of the advantages that come 
from giving these standardized educational tests, which 
are being used in practically every school system of the 
country. But while these tests are being used to com- 
pare school systems with school systems, ete., their most

important function today is to diagnose the differences 
found in a single class and to help the teacher find the 
weak spots in his teaching. . 
There may be a possible danger that the measurement 
movement in education, with its objective analysis, will 
make education more complicated and more mechanical. 
As was stated in Chapter VII we are apt to think of 
education as a manufacturing process with so many units 
of reading, geography, and arithmetic put into the ma- 
chine and a finished product turned out—an educated 
individual. No matter how well selected and propor- 
tioned the mixture of raw material may be, or how well 
it is adapted to the capacity of the learner, unless worthy 
ideals, desires, and appreciations have been developed 
and transformed into spiritual and social forces, all is 
unavailing. 
Professor C. L. Robbins of the University of Iowa gives 
us a most valuable word of warning when he says: 
“We should not permit ourselves to fall a prey to the 
suspicion that whatever cannot be measured and set down 
in mathematical terms must on that account be too vague 
to be worth serious effort.’’? Although we have no objec- 
tive standards for measuring ideals, attitudes, and appre- 
ciations, it does not follow that efficient teaching should 
not be judged by the opportunity given for the forma- 
tion and execution of such ideals, attitudes, and apprecia- 
tions. It may be we need a further set of tests. However, 
we should remember that the amount of reproducible 
knowledge which the educational tests reveal, while of 
real value, should not be confused with the entire aim of 
education. The finest fruit of education is a sympathetic 
understanding of one’s fellow men.

SUMMARY .OF PART THREE 
We have seen in Part Three that the teaching process 
may be analyzed into three fundamental factors: the prin- 
ciples of method, classroom practice, and measuring re- 
sults. 
Method, we found, is but another name for the activities 
engaged in by the teacher and the pupils. It has its foun- 
dations in the nature of the child, in the way he naturally 
learns things. Method takes every advantage of the self- 
activity of the child; it cannot be worked out apart from 
him. The function of method is to solve the following 
complicated problems: How can children learn to the best 
advantage? What can the teacher do to assist them in 
their learning? How does the child, ignorant, helpless, 
and dependent, finally become a useful member of society ? 
Chapter VIII explained some of the problems of class- 
room practice. Four important phases of this problem 
were discussed: The question as a factor in teaching, the 
various types of classroom exercises, the making of lesson 
plans, and the project method of teaching. 
The point was emphasized that the question should not 
be merely a means of securing information for the teacher 
regarding the amount of the pupil’s knowledge; it should 
rouse thought in the pupil’s mind; it should be concerned 
primarily with how and why. Such types of questions 
are the result only of careful preparation on the part of 
the teacher. 
The chapter also brought out the thought that all the 
types of teaching—lecture, object lesson, appreciation les- 
son, project, ete.—should be considered in the light of the 
great aim of education—namely, the largest possible 
165 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  166 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
growth in knowledge, ideals, and skills. The project method 
is an attempt to bring into the play the attitude of the 
learner, to make the pupil put into the learning process 
the voluntary active interest that he puts into other activi- 
ties of his life. 
The school life centers around the recitation, and the 
efficiency of the school is measured by the efficiency of its 
classroom practice. 
Chapter IX dealt with the problem of scientifically 
measuring the results of teaching. Two types of stand- 
ardized tests were described: educational or achievement 
tests, and intelligence or ability tests. The reader was 
cautioned to adopt a scientific attitude toward the use of 
the test. Only those who have had training in psychology 
should attempt to give and interpret intelligence tests. 
However, any teacher who will give the subject some study 
will find it rather easy to use them properly. Neither edu- 
cational nor mental tests should be used excepting where 
there is a real problem to be solved. 
In the first three parts of the book, the problems dis- 
cussed have been the teacher, the child, and the teaching 
process. We are now ready for a discussion of the organ- 
ization of the school and the curriculum where through 
the teaching process the teacher strives to develop the 
child to his fullest capacities. X

CHAPTER X 
THE THREE DIVISIONS OF THE AMERICAN 
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM 
‘Taree Divisions—AN Oxp EstasiisHep Form 
The three divisions—elementary, secondary, and higher 
—which comprise the American school system, form an 
organization that has become almost universal among the 
countries providing a systematic education. There are 
wide differences, however, respecting the years embraced 
in each division and the articulation of the divisions. This 
three-fold arrangement was characteristic of the educa- 
tional practices of ancient Greece. The first period 
beyond infancy, extending from the beginning of the 
sixth or eighth year to the end‘of the fourteenth or 
sixteenth year, was the period of school education; the 
second, extending from the beginning of the fourteenth 
or sixteenth year to the end of the twentieth or twenty- 
first, was the college education; and the third, from about 
the twentieth on, was devoted to university education. 
The education of the Roman youth, a century or more 
before the Christian era, was also organized into this 
threefold arrangement. Upon reaching his sixth or 
seventh year the Roman child began his elementary 
instruction either at home or in a ludus publicus, where 
he learned reading, writing, and simple calculation. At 
about the age of twelve the boy was sent on into the school 
grammaticus, where he was instructed in grammar, in

170 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
the narrower sense, learned by heart portions of Homer 
and other poets, and began the critical study of literature 
and composition. At the age of about sixteen the boy 
exchanged the toga praetexta for the toga virilis, a cere- 
mony which marked the assumption of the responsibilities 
of manhood. His education then depended upon his future 
occupation. 
The American public school system now stands, after 
three centuries of growth, complete in form only. There 
is still a great task to be done in the further unification 
and standardization of its work. Its three divisions— 
elementary, secondary, and higher education—are joined 
together, forming “The American educational ladder.” By 
means of these divisions it is possible for a child of six 
to enter the elementary school, pass regularly from grade 
to grade, and finally to emerge, sixteen or eighteen years 
later, prepared, as far as academic study is concerned, to 
begin his life work. 
Tue Division or ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 
Beginnings of elementary education. From the days of 
the earliest settlement the American colonists demanded 
that their children should have at least the rudiments of 
an education. However, the early colonial schools were 
poorly organized and instruction was meager and hap- 
hazard. In some towns the parents instructed their 
children at home or employed a young man or young 
woman to start them in reading and writing. In some 
places the minister became the schoolmaster. As late as 
1817 the school committee of Boston denied a petition 
signed by one hundred sixteen inhabitants asking that 
primary schools be established-at public expense. The 
committee defended their action on the ground that tit. 
establishment of such schools would be too expensive and
-P-A-G-E-193
  DIVISIONS OF THE AMERICAN SCHOOL SYSTEM 171 
“that most parents have some leisure time and few are 
unequal to the task of teaching the elements of letters.””* 
Much of the elementary instruction during the colonial 
period was given in vacant carpenter shops, in spare 
rooms in old dwellings, in unoccupied barns or basement 
rooms. The work offered in these schools was limited 
to the “three R’s.”” The support of these primary schools 
was various and uncertain. Many of them were main- 
tained for brief periods during the year and were sup- 
ported by lotteries, land rentals, private subscriptions, or 
tuition. The school was often rotated from place to 
place within the community to meet the demand of those 
who settled at some distance from the center. In some 
towns it was kept for a third of the time at each end 
and a third in the middle. In some places it remained 
four months in each of three places, and sometimes a 
school was moved five times within a school year. 
The further development of elementary education. Ele- 
mentary education remained until the beginning of the 
nineteenth century informal, unsystematic, and voluntary 
in respect to both parents and community. The first 
real advance was made when the rotating school was 
superseded by the establishment of permanent schools. 
In 1789 permanent reading and writing schools were or- 
ganized in Boston. The following arrangement, drawn 
up by a committee of which Samuel Adams was a mem- 
ber, gives an interesting picture of the first permanent 
school. 
In Town Meeting, October 16, 1789 
Voted, That there shall be one writing school at the south part 
of town, one at the center, and one at the north part; that in 
tose schools the children of both sexes be taught writing and

-P-A-G-E-194
172 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
also arithmetic in the various branches of (it) usually taught in 
the town schools, including vulgar and decimal fractions. 
That there be one reading school at the south part of the town, 
one at the center, and one at the north part; that in those schools 
the children of both sexes be taught to spell, accent, and read 
both prose and verse, and also be instructed in English grammar 
and composition. 
That the children of both sexes be admitted into the reading 
and writing schools at the age of seven years, having previously 
received the instruction usual at women’s schools; that they be 
allowed to continue in the reading and writing schools until the 
age of fourteen, the boys attending the year round, the girls 
from the twentieth of April to the twentieth of October follow- 
ing; that they attend these schools alternately, at such times and 
subject to such changes as the visiting committee, in consultation 
with the masters, shall approve.t 
In these schools the pupils were not graded according 
to age but according to subjects; that is, all pupils 
between the ages of seven and fourteen attended each 
school in turn. If a pupil attended the reading school 
in the morning, he attended the writing school in the 
afternoon and vice versa. By 1827 the school district 
changed from a unit created for mere social convenience 
to a political institution with power vested in its inhabi- 
tants to levy taxes, to hold meetings, to choose a clerk, 
to select a school site, to erect a building thereon, to 
enforce contracts, and to employ teachers. 
The beginning of graded elementary schools. To secure 
any kind of grading in the schools of the rural com- 
munities and of the villages proved exceedingly difficult. 
In 1839 Henry Barnard wrote that “there was hardly an 
instance of the gradation of schools [in Connecticut] by 
which the evils of crowding children of different ages, of 
both sexes, in every variety of study and schoolbook, 
under a single teacher, were avoided.”   
tAmerican Journal of Education, Vol. 19, page 475. 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
  DIVISIONS OF THE AMERICAN SCHOOL SYSTEM 173 
Again he wrote: 
To enable children to derive the highest degree of benefit from 
their attendance at school, they should go through a regular 
course of training in a succession of classes and schools arranged 
according to similarity of age, standing, and attainments, under 
teachers possessing the qualifications best adapted to each grade 
of school. The practice has been almost universal in New Eng- 
land and in other states where the organization of the schools is 
based upon the division of territory into schoo] districts to pro- 
vide but one school for as many children of both sexes and of all 
ages, from four to sixteen years, as can be gathered in from cer- 
tain territorial limits, into one apartment, under one teacher—a 
female teacher in summer and a male teacher in winter. The 
disadvantages of this practice, both to pupils and teachers, are 
great and manifold.t 
As the school attendance of a given district increased, 
either through growth of population or through the con- 
solidation of districts, the segregation was sometimes 
brought about by removing the older children to a point 
central to the joint district, while the younger children 
were left behind to attend at their several schools. Barnard 
gives us an interesting description of the arrangement: 
Provision is made [in the law] for the union of two or more 
districts, for the purpose of maintaining a union school for the 
older children of the associated districts, while the younger chil- 
dren are left to attend in the several districts under female 
teachers. 
The union of schoo] districts thus authorized obviates many of 
the difficulties and evils of common schools as they are, and se- 
cures a much higher degree of improvement with the same means. 
In a large portion of the district schools the ages of the scholars 
range from 4 to 16, or, rather from 3 to 18. The studies extend 
from the first rudiments to the branches of an academical edu- 
cation; the classes are numerous as the various studies, increased 
by the variety of textbooks in the same branch; and the teachers 
are constantly changing from male to female, and from season 
to season. ;

-P-A-G-E-196
  174 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
Now the plan of union districts, leaving the younger children 
to themselves and including the older children together, cuts down 
by one-half the variety of ages, studies, and classes. It enables 
the teacher to adopt methods of classification, instruction, and 
government suited to each grade of school.t 
This was the first step taken in the movement, not com- 
pleted at the present day, toward unifying and standard- 
izing the elementary school organization. The movement 
toward graded schools developed slowly at first, but 
by 1860 nearly every city and town of any consequence, 
as well as many populous rural communities, had its own 
unified system of elementary schools organized on a graded 
basis with a definite course of study. 
Tue Division or Higher Epucation? 
The colonial colleges. Prior to the Revolutionary War 
there were nine colleges established in the American col- 
onies. The colonial colleges were dominated by the relig- 
ious influences of the time. At first it was the ministry 
only for which a college education was desired. Harvard 
was founded in part out of a “dread to leave an illiterate 
ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall 
lie in dust.’’® For 60 years it was little more than a train- 
ing school for ministers. The application for a charter 
permitting the founding of the College of William and 
Mary was supported by the declaration that, “Virginians 
had souls to be saved as well as their English countrymen 
and that the institution was needed to prepare young 
men for the ministry.”* While there was nothing in 
Yale’s charter requiring a religious test for trustees, rec- 
tors, or tutors, yet those instrumental in its founding

planned that it should be controlled by a synod of 
churches, and that it should be called the “School of the 
Church.”* Though this plan was not fully executed, the 
initial steps in founding the college were taken by a body 
which comprised the principal clergymen of New Haven 
Colony. Of the six remaining colleges established before 
the Revolution, only one (Philadelphia Academy, merged 
into the University of Pennsylvania) was non-sectarian. 
Princeton was founded primarily to secure a supply of 
ministers for the Presbyterian churches of Maryland, 
Virginia, and the middle colonies. While it was con- 
trolled by Presbyterians, there was a larger lay memn- 
bership in its governing board than had obtained at 
Harvard, William and Mary, or Yale. The Philadelphia 
Academy embodied in its constitution the idea of Ben- 
jamin Franklin. In this constitution there is no mention 
made of religion, of the church, or of the ministry, 
and in this respect the institution expressed a signifi- 
cant modern note. Two-thirds of the first board of 
trustees of King’s College (now Columbia) were com- 
municants of the Church of England, and, while the col- 
lege was founded nominally as a civil institution, the con- 
dition was exacted that the president of the college should 
be a member of the Episcopal church and that the 
religious service of the college should be from the liturgy 
of that church. Brown College (Providence, R. I.) was 
founded in response to definite and formal action taken 
by the Baptist Association of Philadelphia. Its charter 
opened the doors of the college to all denominations of 
Protestants, expressly prohibiting any religious test for 
its students, yet affirming its connection with the church 
by requiring the president to be a member of the Baptist 
church and placing the governing board under its control.

    176 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
Dartmouth College was the outgrowth of a plan projected 
by the Rev. Eleazar Wheelock to train Indians of both 
sexes in religious and secularylearning, and to send them 
back to their tribes to be teachers and preachers. One 
half of the first board of trustees were Congregational 
ministers and the other half civil authorities of the Con- 
necticut Colony. The charter makes emphatic the origi- 
nal purpose of the institution—namely, “the spread of the 
Redeemer’s Kingdom”; but it also makes clear that no 
one shall be excluded from its benefits because of denom- 
inational affiliations or because of religious beliefs. 
Queens College (now Rutgers) was founded by the Hol- 
landers, adherents of the Reform faith, with a double 
purpose—to promote learning and to train clergymen for 
service in the New World. 
It is difficult for us to realize how fully religious mat- 
ters filled the minds of the men of that day and how 
profoundly the institutions which they established were 
thus influenced. 
More than one-half of the graduates of Harvard during the 
seventeenth century entered the ministry, and of the first 33 grad- 
uates of Yale 25 became preachers. An examination of the 
names of those who are listed as students in the Boston Latin 
School between the years 1635 and 1734 will show that of those 
whose life occupation is mentioned one-half belonged to the 
clergy.

Rapid growth of colleges in the nineteenth century. 
While 24 colleges were founded prior to 1800, the most 
remarkable growth of the institutions of higher learning 
came in the nineteenth century. At the beginning cf 
that century the 24 colleges had not more than 100 pro- 
fessors and instructors nor more than 2,000 students, and 
$1,000,000 would cover the aggregate value of college 
property. After 1820 new colleges developed rapidly. 
This pronounced interest of the nineteenth century in 
higher education was greatly stimulated by two provi- 
sions which the National Government made for the found- 
ing and support of higher education. The Ordinance 
of 1787 provided that two complete townships in each 
state formed from the public domain might be set apart 
for university purposes. Under the operation of this act 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
178 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
every state admitted into the union since the year 1800, 
with the exception of Maine, Texas, and West Virginia, 
has received not less than two townships for the purpose 
of founding a university. The grants for institutions of 
higher learning under this law have aggregated more 
than a million acres. 
The second provision by which the National Govern- 
ment encouraged the founding of such institutions was 
that called the Morrill Act, passed by Congress in 1862. 
This act provided for a grant of 30,000 acres of land for each 
representative and senator in Congress. The grant conveyed in 
all 9,600,000 acres, and the amount raised from the sale of this 
land varying in different states from $50,000 to $750,000 was to 
be applied to institutions at which technical and agricultural 
branches should be taught. As a result, within 20 years, every 
state in the union had established such a school, either in connec- 
tion with an existing college or as a new institution. Besides 
these grants, Congress gave to the several states (1850) certain 
swamp lands, aggregating nearly 48,000,000 acres. Some states— 
California for instanee—appropriated their share to the uni- 
versity; others turned the proceeds into their general school fund. 
In consequence of the federal aid so generously given, colleges 
and universities multiplied with unprecedented rapidity. So 
rapidly, indeed, were they founded, that in a single century, while 
the population of the country increased six times, the number of 
instructors increased 170 times, the number of students 47 times, 
and the property and productive funds 200 times.1 
Influence of colleges upon secondary schools. Under 
the influence of college and university, a large number of 
preparatory schools have grown up. Naturally the work 
of such schools has been shaped by the college ideal. As 
the college changed, so the preparatory school changed. 
As the college took on more work, it raised its admission 
standards and crowded more of its work back into the 
preparatory school. At the other end of the ladder stood

the elementary school, at first satisfied merely with secur- 
ing but a small degree of literacy, but becoming more 
ambitious and effective as time passed. As the elementary 
school grew more efficient, a demand developed for a 
school that should be more advanced and yet not neces- 
sarily preparatory to college. The colleges seeking a 
means of preparing their prospective students, and the 
elementary schools seeking to broaden their work, pro- 
duced two opposing tendencies. The conflict that has 
resulted within the field of secondary education has been 
sharp and long continued, but out of it has come a dis- 
tinctly American institution, the free public high school. 
Tue Division or SEconpary Epucation 
Beginnings of secondary education. The secondary 
schools of the colonies, the so-called Latin-Grammar 
schools, closely resembled the Latin-Grammar schools of 
England. It was natural that these early colonial gram- 
mar schools should be similar to those of England, for 
many of the colonists had been trained in the English 
schools and universities. 
The American colonists inherited from their English ancestors 
a purpose and a plan to provide such preparatory training for 
their talented sons as would enable them to pursue a college 
course successfully and later to assume honorable positions in 
Church and State; but it was left to the American people of the 
nineteenth century to devise and develop a system of free educa- 
tion that should give equal opportunity to all, regardless of sex, 
social position, or future purpose in life. Beginning with the 
Latin-Grammar school, founded at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 
1635, the course of development of American secondary educa- 
tion has been through the academy to the free publie high school. 
The third century since the founding of Plymouth Colony has 
seen the general disappearance of the grammar school and the 
academy, and at the same time a phenomenal development of the 
public high school. A sharp delimitation of the periods of these

three classes of schools cannot be made, but it may be said in 
general that the grammar school flourished from early colonial 
times till the Revolution; the academy from the Revoiution till 
the Civil War; and the high school from that date till the present 
time.t 
The Latin-Grammar school. The first secondary school 
in the colonies was the Boston-Latin school, established 
in 1635. The New Haven grammar school had a very 
suggestive set of rules governing it, and that school may 
be taken as typical of the work and spirit of the earlier 
schools of this class.

at New Haven to he observed & attended in ye said Schoole, made,

  DIVISIONS OF THE AMERICAN SCHOOL SYSTEM 181 
The defects and characteristics of the Latin-Grammar 
school. The Latin-Grammar schools were never popular 
with the people at large. There was a law requiring that 
they be established and supported in towns having one 
hundred families; however, this was vigorously opposed 
by a considerable minority, and in some cases the town 
officials quietly paid the fine for non-compliance with the 
law. In other communities they tried to escape by re- 
porting that they could find no teacher. People who 
wished their sons to go to college supported these schools, 
while those who could not afford to patronize the college 
were unable to see the benefit of such schools. 
The Latin-Grammar school gradually passed away be- 
cause it made a poor connection with the elementary 
school and because its course of study appealed only to 
those people who saw in it a means to enter the college. 
No attempt was made to form a close articulation between 
the elementary schools and the Latin-Grammar schools. 
The former scarcely looked beyond themselves, and the 
latter looked forward to the college. 
The main characteristics of the grammar schools may 
be stated as follows: 1. They were established by the 
towns under colonial law. 2. They were small schools 
usually taught by one or two teachers. 3. These schools 
were free, though fees of some sort were usually paid 
except in the case of the poorest pupils. 4. Their main 
purpose was to prepare for college, and therefore the 
curriculum was made up for the most part of Latin and 
Greek. 5. Girls were not admitted, for few thought at 
this time that it was worth while educating them. 
The academies. The academy, like the Latin-Grammar 
school, was of English origin. The earliest American 
academy was established at Philadelphia in 1761. It 
afterwards developed into the University of Pennsyl-  
-P-A-G-E-204
  182 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
vania. The courses of study in the academy at first 
showed much less dependence upon the college than did 
those of the Latin-Grammar schools. The academy was 
a finishing school and naturally was not so largely domi- 
nated by the influence of the university as was the gram- 
mar school. In the beginning there were two courses, 
one which prepared for college and the other which gave 
a practical preparation for life. The college preparatory 
course soon overshadowed the general course, and the 
academy in time became a college preparatory school, just 
as the Latin-Grammar school had been. The academy 
appealed to the people as far as its ideals and courses of 
study were concerned, but it declined and was replaced 
by the public high school because it was not free and 
made no organic connection with the elementary school. 
The academy and the elementary school had much in 
common; that is, they both looked, not to a higher school, 
but to the preparation of their pupils for the duties of 
practical life. The fact that the elementary schools were 
supported by public taxation, while the academies were 
private institutions, prevented a unity of management 
and concerted action on the part of the two schools. 
Main characteristics of the academy. The particular 
characteristics of the American academies may be stated 
as follows: 1. They represented a protest against the 
narrow classical training afforded by the grammar 
schools. 2. They sought to give a substantial secondary 
education to young people regardless of whether they 
wished to go to college or not. 3. Their early develop- 
ment was almost entirely independent of the college, but 
they soon came to be dominated by the college and uni- 
versity. 4. They were organized and managed by pri- 
vate effort and supported, for the most part, by private 
funds, subscriptions, endowments, and tuition fees. 5. In
-P-A-G-E-205
DIVISIONS OF THE AMERICAN SCHOOL SYSTEM 183 
most cases they admitted girls as well as boys. 6. They 
were animated by a broader, freer, more truly American 
spirit than the grammar schools, a spirit more in accord 
with the developing characteristics of American democ- 
racy. 7. The fact that they were managed by private 
effort and that they were not free prevented any organic 
connection with the public elementary schools and ren- 
dered them somewhat exclusive. 
The high school. The high school, historically consid- 
ered, is simply a continuation of the elementary school. 
The people appreciated the free elementary schools to such 
an extent that they were glad to tax themselves to afford a 
higher education which should continue training, not for 
college but for life. The first high school in the United 
States was founded at Boston in 1821. It was established 
under the name of The English Classical High School. 
The report of the school committee presents the existing 
situation of the times rather clearly: 
Though the present system of publie education, and the mag- 
nificence with which it is supported, are highly beneficial and 
honorable to the Town; yet in the opinion of the Committee, 
it is susceptible of a greater degree of perfection and useful- 
ness, without materially augmenting the weight of the public 
burdens. Till recently, our system occupied a middle station: 
it neither commenced with the rudiments of Education, nor ex- 
tended to the higher branches of knowledge. This system was 
supported by the Town at a very great expense, and to be 
admitted to its advantages, certain preliminary qualifications 
were required at individual cost, which have the effect of ex- 
cluding many children of the poor and unfortunate classes of 
the community from the benefits of a public education. The 
Town saw and felt this inconsistency in the plan, and have 
removed the defect by providing schools in which the children 
of the poor can be fitted for admission into the public semi- 
naries. The mode of education now adopted, and the branches 
of knowledge that are taught at our English grammar schools, 
are not sufficiently extensive nor otherwise calculated to bring
-P-A-G-E-206
  
184 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
the powers of the mind into operation nor to qualify a youth 
to fill usefully and respectably many of those stations, both 
publie and private, in which it may be placed. A parent who 
wishes to give a child an education that shall fit him for active 
life, and shall serve as a foundation for eminence in his pro- 
fession, whether Mercantile or Mechanical, is under the neces- 
sity of giving him a different education from any which our 
public schools can now furnish. Hence, many children are 
separated from their parents and sent to private academies in 
this vicinity, to acquire that instruction which cannot be ob- 
tained at the public seminaries.     
Democracy and the high school. The Latin-Grammar 
schools and the academies were entirely out of harmony 
with the growing spirit of American freedom and democ- 
racy. As a result there grew up a strong social demand 
for an ideal institution of a definite type, one that should 
be free and under public control like the grammar school 
and that should offer a practical course of study like the 
academy. There was a demand for education more than 
that provided by an elementary school, different in kind 
from that found in the grammar schools, and furnished 
at public expense. The free public high school came 
into existence to meet this demand. It developed rather 
slowly at first, but as its usefulness was recognized it 
grew rapidly. 
The following table shows the growth of the public 
high schools from 1890 to 1920 :?

Summary oF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE THREE DIvIsIONS 
In the development of the three divisions of the Ameri- 
can public school system we have seen that the colleges 
were the first to develop, then the elementary schools, and 
finally the high schools. 
The colleges extended downward into the Latin-Grammar 
schools as preparatory schools. The elementary schools extended 
upwards into the academies and later into the high schools as a 
means for the extension of a general, practical education. But 
neither the grammar school, the academy, nor the high school was 
at its origin regarded as the connecting link between the elemen- 
tary schools and the colleges. The relation was an after-thought 
which the State University of Michigan did much to make effec- 
tive. ‘It is clear now, that in the nature of things, the free public 
high school was the only one of these three institutions which 
could survive and perform this function. It alone could serve 
the whole people alike, the rich and the poor, equally well those 
who desired to prepare [for college] and those who did not.? 
The story of the development of the three divisions of 
the American public school system is, according to 
Bunker, a story of a conflict between two demands: 
that for a college preparation on the one hand, and on the 
other for a noncollegiate preparation extending beyond the ele-   
4Not including pupils in seventh and eighth grades in junior high schools. *Brown, J. F., The American High School, pages 29-30. Reprinted by per- mission of The Macmillan Company, publishers.

186 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
mentary grades. As in every country developing a system of 
education, the colleges reached downward to find a means of 
preparation for the few, while the elementary schools reached 
upward in order to secure an extension of a general, practical 
education for the many. It has remained for America alone to 
develop an institution which has harmonized the two—the free 
public high school. Inasmuch, however, as each of the three 
divisions comprising the system sprang from separate and dis- 
tinct sources and grew to considerable proportions independ- 
ently of the others, and in response to the shaping power of 
different conditions, the whole which the fusing process of recent 
years has given us is complete in form only. In organic relation, 
in sharpness of province, and in distinctiveness of function, these 
divisions are not yet satisfactorily articulated.t 
Questions and Problems 
1. How do you account for the fact that the threefold 
arrangement of educational practices has been almost universal 
among the countries providing a systematic education? 
2. How do you account for the three different and distinct 
origins of elementary, secondary, and higher education in 
America? 
3. Suppose these three divisions (elementary, secondary, 
and higher) had all originated at the same time and from the 
same source. Would conditions today be any different? 
4. Why did secondary education reach a much higher stage 
of development during the colonial period than did elementary 
education? 
5. In what ways does the separate origin of the elementary 
school and the high school explain the difference today in the 
preparation and standing of high-school teachers and elemen- 
tary teachers? 
6. Show how the Latin-Grammar school and the academy 
were both opposed to the growing spirit of American freedom 
and democracy. 
7. In what sense is the high school the ‘‘peoples’ school’’? 
8. Does the modern high school have any of the characteris- 
ties of the Latin-Grammar school?

9. Why was it impossible for either the Latin-Grammar 
school or the academy to become the connecting link between 
the elementary schools and the colleges? 
10. Why was the high school the only one of the three 
secondary institutions which could survive and become the 
connecting link between the elementary schools and the col- 
leges?

CHAPTER XI 
REORGANIZATION OF ELEMENTARY AND 
SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Divisions oF THE ScHOoL YEARS 
There is a growing tendency among school adminis- 
trators to consider grades one to six, inclusive, as con- 
stituting the elementary school, and the secondary school 
period as commencing with the seventh grade and extend- 
ing through the twelfth. The six years devoted to sec- 
ondary education are divided into two periods of three 
years each, which are designated as the junior and the 
senior high schools, respectively. The six years of ele- 
mentary education are to meet the needs of pupils of 
approximately six to twelve years of age, and the six 
years of secondary education are to meet the needs of 
pupils of approximately twelve to eighteen years of age. 
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
The aim and purpose of the elementary school. The 
elementary school, in connection with other social insti- 
tutions such as the home, the church, the library, and the 
playground, takes the child at the age of five or six, and 
for six or eight years enlarges his experiences and 
strengthens his powers and capacities. Because of the 
child’s immaturity, dependence upon others, and lack of 
social experience, the elementary school must give him 
the knowledge, attitudes, habits, and skills necessary for 
189
-P-A-G-E-212
  190 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
a highly developed social environment. The elementary 
school must realize that its purpose in educating boys and 
girls is to help them live more abundantly while they are 
boys and girls. Meeting each day’s need of childhood is 
the best preparation for meeting the needs of adult life. 
Meriam says: “The great purpose of the elementary 
school is to help boys and girls do better in all those 
wholesome activities in which they normally engage.” 
Bonser? considers the purpose of the elementary school 
is to provide experiences to meet the common needs of all, 
regardless of sex, vocation, or social status. Its content is 
made up of those activities in which everyone must par- 
ticipate with a like degree of knowledge and skill and 
with like attitude and appreciation in order that there 
may be an efficient social life. Its activities, values, and 
ideals may be regarded as “the common denominator of 
life for the whole nation.” It deals with children during 
a period in their lives when their general tendencies to 
action, thought, and feeling, are most nearly alike and 
most susceptible to common appeal. It deals with social 
problems which are the same for all. It applies itself to 
the development in the child of that knowledge, of those 
habits, attitudes, ideals, and appreciations which enable 
people to understand each other, to share in the common 
life, and to codperate in realizing common purposes. 
This, of course, does not mean that the facts of individual 
differences in children are to be neglected in the ele- 
mentary school. In method of teaching, individual dif- 
ferences are of the utmost importance, but the content of 
activities—“the understanding of how the needs of life 
are met, the experience of the race in living, the value to 
life of interests and activities as found in history and   
1Child Life and the Ourriculum, page 147. 2The Elementary School Curriculum.
-P-A-G-E-213
REORGANIZATION OF EDUCATION 191 
literature, the ways of recreation, present and past, the 
tools used by man, as reading, writing, number, drawing, 
mechanical skills, and devices for group activity”*—should 
be the same in the elementary school for all children 
everywhere. The content appropriate for the elementary 
school is of equal interest and value to boys and to girls. 
That the primary aim of the elementary school is to 
teach the three R’s is perhaps still the conscious ideal 
of the general public, especially of those who were trained 
during the nineteenth century. But there is rapidly grow- 
ing a feeling that an elementary school which gives its 
pupils no more than the three R’s is not meeting the needs 
of this generation. A thorough training in the use of the 
tools of education must always be the foundation of the 
elementary curriculum, but today a majority of the peo- 
ple demand that the school shall assume additional respon- 
sibility. Schools have no basis for existence except that 
of providing helpful means of and experiences in meet- 
ing the problems and various needs of life itself. The 
elementary school, therefore, justifies itself in the measure 
in which it equips individuals to engage efficiently in the 
activities of life. Only as the knowledge, habits, skills, 
attitudes, ideals, and appreciations developed in the ele- 
mentary school are operative in meeting the problems of 
life, are they of real educative value. 
We may briefly summarize the functions of the ele- 
mentary school as follows: (1) to develop growth in the 
power to manipulate the tool subjects—the three R’s; (2) 
to develop growth in knowledge of worth-while experi- 
ences; (3) to develop growth in the power of appreciation 
of beauty, people, and humor; (4) to develop growth in 
the power of codperation with others; (5) to develop 
growth in the power of self-expression; (6) to develop

192 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
growth in the ideals of personal responsibility; (7) to 
develop growth in right habits of physical living. 
The problem of the elementary school curriculum. The 
problem of selecting the content of the elementary school 
curriculum is, first, that of determining the objectives of 
life in terms of different needs; second, finding the means 
or forms of activity best adapted to meet these needs; and 
third, presenting these needs together with the activities 
for meeting them. 
Bonser’ classifies the general aims of life in terms of 
four large fields of purposeful activity: first, the health 
activities of everyday life; second, the practical activities 
of everyday life; third, the codperating activities of 
everyday life; and fourth, the recreational activities of 
everyday life. If we consider these aims, then the pur- 
poses of the elementary school are to provide a basis for 
health equally desirable for all; to develop practical effi- 
ciency in activities shared by all in daily work and inter- 
course; to develop ideals and habits of group activity of 
equal value to all; and to cultivate means of recreation 
‘common to all. 
Many similar classifications can be made of the aims of 
the school in terms of life purposes. Any normal indi- 
vidual can be found at any time living, thinking, feeling, 
and acting in one or another of five major fields of activ- 
ity: in the home, at work, at play, in the field of social 
intercourse, or in organized social life. These are the five 
classes of relationships and activities for which the ele- 
mentary school must prepare its pupils. 
In studying the forces which brought the school into 
existence we get another similar classification of aims. 
The school is an institution established and maintained by 
society for the purpose of developing society’s efficiency.

  REORGANIZATION OF EDUCATION 193. 
Social efficiency has been analyzed into five types: physi- 
eal efficiency, moral efficiency, vocational efficiency, 
avocational efficiency, and civic efficiency. Therefore the 
elementary school must equip its pupils with the neces- 
sary knowledge, habits, skills, attitudes, ideals, and 
appreciations which will enable them to become efficient 
in health, in morality, in recreation, in work, and in 
citizenship. 
Some of these aims, such as vocational efficiency, are 
partially excluded from the elementary school because of 
the immaturity of the child. However, the elementary 
school should make a beginning toward those objectives 
which cannot be completely achieved during this period. 
In other words, there are no aims or objectives which are 
the exclusive province of either the elementary or second- 
ary school. Even a command of the tool subjects, such as 
reading, sufficient for the needs of modern life, must be 
further developed in the junior and senior high school. 
The fundamental aims of education must be the same for 
all schools, just as the education of the child must be a 
gradual, continuous process leading upward to larger and 
more valuable activities and social experiences. We 
should not think of our public school system. as broken 
up into two distinct periods and systems—the elementary 
and secondary—but rather as a twelve-year period of 
growth and training for every child. 
In meeting all of these large life problems the only 
means of education and growth is effective and satisfied 
participation in these activities. We learn to do by 
doing. Therefore, the curriculum should be, as far as 
possible, a series of purposeful activities in meeting life’s 
needs in the best way. The teachers’ problem lies in help- 
ing to bring about the filling of these needs in some 
orderly arrangement, and in so directing the activities
-P-A-G-E-218
194 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
that pupils discover and utilize the most valuable knowl- 
edge and the best methods of procedure. 
The elementary school must not over-emphasize subject- 
matter as a preparation for advanced work along the same 
lines. The outlook must be as much toward life outside 
the schools as toward higher work in the schools. We 
must not overlook the fact that the school must be 
brought into harmony with the needs and requirements of 
a progressive society. In the past much of the subject- 
matter in the elementary school has been selected largely 
on the basis of its preparatory value in preparing pupils 
for the grade or school above. The work in the primary 
grades prepared for intermediate grade work, and this in 
turn was preparatory to the work in the grammar grades. 
In this scheme of things the child is subordinated to the 
subject-matter. But the material to be taught must be 
selected according to present and probable future needs 
of the child instead of to the subject-matter in the next 
higher grade. Much of the content of arithmetic, lan- 
guage, geography, and physiology, which has been pushed 
down from the higher grades, is burdened with abstract 
principles and details which do not reach the interests of 
the child and which possess very little educative value for 
him. Subject-matter and method must be adapted to the 
nature of the child, and to his needs in the society in 
which he is to live. The child must be the “center of 
gravity” in the selection and presentation of subject- 
matter.

The junior high school focuses attention upon three 
defects in our educational system—namely: defects in 
articulation between the elementary and secondary 
school, that is, faulty transition from one stage of the
-P-A-G-E-219
  
  _ REORGANIZATION OF EDUCATION 195 
pupil's life and training to the next; the large amount of 
retardation and elimination, that is, the problem of the 
backward child and the child who drops out of school; 
and the late provision made for recognizing individual 
differences. 
The gap between the elementary and the high school. 
The transition from our eight-year elementary school to 
the four-year high school means the breaking up of well 
established social groups among pupils and the sudden 
forming of new social groups. The necessary readjust- 
ments are very difficult in most cases and are very similar 
to those which face the college freshmen or the boy who 
moves to a strange town. In a large number of elemen- 
tary schools the pupil has practically all his study and 
work under a single teacher who knows him in all his 
activities. On passing to the high school he suddenly 
finds himself with three or four teachers, no one of whom 
knows him in such a way that his various activities may be 
coérdinated. The high-school freshman also finds himself 
confronted with studies different in many respects from 
those of the eighth grade. The studies of the eighth grade 
have been pursued for many years and he is familiar with 
them, while in the first year of high school most of the 
subjects are unfamiliar and studied from a viewpoint and 
by methods unknown to the pupil. 
The teachers in the elementary schools have received 
their training in normal schools and teachers’ colleges, 
while the great majority of high-school teachers are 
graduates of liberal arts colleges. Those who receive 
their training in normal schools and teachers’ colleges 
tend to emphasize method and the pupil rather than sub- 
ject-matter; the graduates of liberal arts colleges have 
received very little professional training, and so are 
inclined to over-emphasize subject-matter. This causes a
-P-A-G-E-220
196 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
distinctly different type of teaching in the high school 
from that of the elementary school. High-school teachers 
are apt to think more of the needs of the subject they are 
teaching than of the needs of the pupils. The methods of 
discipline also differ very widely in the elementary school 
and high school. Inglis says: 
No justification can be found for the sudden and abrupt change 
within three months from the maternalism of the elementary 
school to the individualism of the high school. . . . The present 
form of articulation between elementary and secondary education 
violates the most important laws of continuous and gradual 
development of children. Changes in development must come, 
but the sudden abrupt changes between our elementary and high 
schools demand a capacity for adaptation and readjustment not 
found in the average boy and girl.t 
The junior high school attempts to correct the defects 
in articulation between the elementary and high school 
by making possible a closer relationship between each 
successive grade and the preceding one, as far as teaching 
material and subject-matter are concerned. The follow- 
ing gradual changes are made possible: the gradual 
change from the one-teacher plan of the grade school to 
the many-teacher plan of the high school; the gradual 
change from largely supervised work in the earlier grades 
to the more independent work and responsibility in the 
later grades; the gradual introduction of new subject- 
matter and its proper relationing to the old; and the 
gradual introduction of the elective system of studies and 
courses. * 
The second defect that the junior high school attempts 
to remedy is the problem of retardation and elimination.

REORGANIZATION OF EDUCATION 197 
Inglis gives the following statistics regarding elimination 
of pupils :* 
Nine-tenths remain in school until 12 or 13 years of age. 
Four-fifths remain in school until 14. 
Two-thirds remain in school until 15. 
One-half remain in school until 16. 
One-third remain in school until 17. 
Another view of elimination is given as follows: 
Three-fourths who enter school reach the sixth grade of school. 
One-half who enter school complete elementary school. 
One-third who enter school enter high school. 
One-eighth who enter school complete high school. 
The boy or girl who leaves school at the close of the 
sixth grade has received very little training which will 
enable him to meet his or her needs in life. The same is 
true of those who leave school after completing the eighth 
grade. The junior high school provides for a reorganiza- 
tion of the subject-matter of the seventh, eighth, and 
ninth grades so as to provide a richer and more useful 
form of education for those who leave early. The junior 
high school makes possible the introduction of prevoca- 
tional and preview education, and also provides the 
encouragement for boys and girls to complete their edu- 
cation through the senior high school. 
The psychology of individual differences indicates that 
provision must be made earlier than in our present high- 
school period for adapting the work to the different capaci- 
ties, interests, and needs of the pupils. Because of this 
factor of individual differences the sudden change from 
elementary to secondary education is dangerous, not only 
to the individual but to society. The junior high school 
makes provision for an earlier introduction of different   
4]bid, page 287. 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  
198 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
studies for different groups of pupils; promotion by sub- 
jects; the introduction of forms of instruction which may 
give pupils an opportunity to discover and test out their 
capacities, interests, and needs; educational direction and 
guidance. The needs of the boys and girls who leave 
school should be met far more satisfactorily by the junior 
high school than under the old system of the eight-year 
elementary and the four-year high school. 
Characteristics of the junior high school. The junior 
high school is a trying-out school; a school where pupils 
are given an opportunity to find themselves by coming in 
contact with a variety of significant experiences. One 
of the main purposes of such a school is to afford boys 
and girls a basis for an intelligent choice of their educa- 
tional and perhaps vocational career. 
The course of study and the subject-matter are extensive 
rather than intensive. In English literature, instead of 
studying a few selections intensively, the purpose is to 
introduce the pupils to a large amount of literature. The 
social sciences, including history, geography, and civies, 
are taught for the purpose of developing an interest in 
social, civic, economic, and industrial questions and. of 
establishing a point of view and a foundation for open- 
mindedness. When the pupils enter senior high school 
they should be able to make an intelligent choice of his- 
tory, economies, or sociology. Those who do not enter 
high school will have received information, knowledge, and 
ideals necessary for all members of society. 
In junior high school mathematics the pupil is intro- 
duced to several branches: arithmetic, algebra, construc- 
tive geometry, and simple trigonometry. The purpose of 
this course is the same as that of the others—namely, to 
enable the child to discover his interest and ability and to 
lay a foundation for more intensive study in senior high 
school, should he continue his mathematics course. The
-P-A-G-E-223
  REORGANIZATION OF EDUCATION 199 
boy or girl who does not continue his education beyond the 
junior high school will have received some valuable 
knowledge that can be put to use in the workaday world. 
In general science the pupil is introduced to a variety 
of fields, such as physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, 
and hygiene. The purpose of such a course is to give the 
child a better understanding of the world in which he 
lives, to make it possible for children to discover whether 
they have any interest and ability in the field of science, 
and to prepare them for further scientific study if they 
are so inclined. 
Manual arts, including woodwork, sheet-metal work, 
forging, electric wiring, printing, bookbinding, ete., are 
not taught for the purpose of preparing pupils directly 
for industrial work, but rather to contribute to their gen- 
eral development; to provide an opportunity for them to 
come into contact with useful activities under proper 
guidance, and to discover their interests and ability in the 
field of manual arts. 
Difficulties confronting the junior high school. The 
junior high school is confronted with at least two major 
difficulties. The first of these is the division of our school 
system into three departments: elementary, junior high 
school, and senior high school. This involves the danger 
of making two critical points of transition rather than 
one. Great care must be taken lest the evils found at the 
one point of division may not be increased by the crea- 
tion of two points of division. 
One of the greatest problems, if not the greatest 
problem involved, is the change necessary in teachers, 
methods, and textbooks. At present we have few teach- 
ers who have been trained for junior high school teach- 
ing. Our present junior high schools are taught by 
former elementary teachers or high-school teachers. In 
one case we have a junior high school building in which 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
200 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
the teaching and methods are the same as in the elemen- 
tary school. In another case we have a junior high school 
building where the teaching and methods are the same as 
in the old four-year high school. In neither case do we have 
a real junior high school that meets the needs of junior 
high school boys and girls who are different from ele- 
mentary pupils and still different from senior high sckool 
pupils. Just as teachers are few, so there are few suitable 
textbooks for the work of the junior high school. The 
present elementary and high-school texts will not serve 
the purpose if we intend really to correct the defects of 
articulation between the elementary and the high schools. 
Many so-called junior high schools merely house together 
the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades without making any 
curriculum changes. This practice is bad. If the junior 
high school is really to function, it means a reorganization 
of subject-matter and method of teaching as well as of 
administrative aims. 
A Summary or A Report on Junior High ScHoois 
According to the report of a sub-committee on the 
junior high school, authorized by and presented to the 
National Council of Education at Chicago, February, 
1923, “It is the difficult mission of the junior high school 
to continue a program of studies carried through the six 
years of the elementary school, modify and enlarge this 
program for the realization of its own purposes, and in 
turn prepare for advanced types of curricula in the senior 
high schools. It is plain that this can be done only 
through successive periods in the transitional process. 
Briefly, these periods are four in number: 
“Adjustment. Low seventh (7A). A period of adjust- 
ment for the very young and immature adolescent of 
twelve years of age. He must be adjusted to a new school 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
REORGANIZATION OF EDUCATION 201 
organization and to a new type of school administration. 
It would seem wise, therefore, to subject him, during the 
first semester at least, to as little change as possible in 
the program of studies. Such change as is desirable 
should restrict itself to the inevitable modifications in the 
course of study which are consequent to enlarged school 
facilities and departmentalization. There should be no 
change in the program of studies occasioned by the intro- 
duction of electives. In fact, the tabulated report of the 
questionnaire shows over fifty per cent vote in favor of 
postponing electives to the eighth year. Present practice 
gives little support to any seventh-year elective. 
“Exploration and preview. (Apperceptive Basis of Sec- 
ondary Courses.) High seventh and low eighth (7B and 
8A). There should be a period of exploration when there 
is a preview of the specialized secondary-school courses, 
which give one ground for distinguishing one high-school 
curriculum from another, and when prevocational try-out 
is provided for drop-outs. This first general view of 
the secondary-school subject-matter is restricted to the 
‘simpler aspects’ of the whole subject-field prior to any 
attempt to cross-section it into its parts. This general 
introductory course offers opportunity for exploration of 
aptitude for the whole subject-field and for a preview or 
apperceptive basis for the cross-sections of the subjects. 
Properly, therefore, junior high school courses are desig- 
nated as general mathematics, general science, world his- 
tory, and general social science, prevocational courses, 
junior high school business methods and training, ete., 
ete. 
“Provisional choice of electives. High eighth (8B). 
Following the period of exploration and preview there 
should be a period of provisional choice of electives. Dur- 
ing this period facility of cross-over between electives
-P-A-G-E-226
202 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
should be promoted by every administrative device pos- 
sible, to the end of guaranteeing that evidence of unfit- 
ness for an elective will be followed by a change of elec- 
tive. In case this period of provisional choice does not 
extend beyond one semester, there would be justification 
for postponing promotion requirements in electives dur- 
ing this semester. 
Periods of articulation between the elementary and the 
secondary programs of studies: The periods of adjust- 
ment, exploration, and provisional choice of electives cover 
the first two years of the junior high school. These are 
the stages in the transitional progress which should pro- 
vide an enrichment of the single curriculum by the articu- 
lation of elementary and secondary courses of study, 
which should explore individual interests, capacities, and 
aptitudes, and which should finally test the tentative 
choice in the light of actual contact with provisional elec- 
tives. In short, these stages are the adjusting, finding, 
and testing periods to the end of developing a unit of 
transition between elementary and secondary education. 
They are the initial stage of the secondary school’s 
program of studies, where the individual makes his ad- 
justment between the en masse organization of the elemen- 
tary school’s organization and that of the senior high 
schools. 
‘Stimulation. Ninth year. Finally in the accomplish- 
ment of the purpose of the junior high school to serve as 
a transitional stage in the public school system, there must 
be a period of stimulation to facilitate transition to the 
senior high school. The ninth year carries on the program 
selected after the experiment of the two previous grades. 
This stimulation is largely effected by the agency of the 
particular electives chosen during the period of explora- 
tion and provisional choice.
-P-A-G-E-227
  REORGANIZATION OF EDUCATION 203 
“There can be no close lines of demarcation drawn in 
time and extent between these four successive stages. 
Each stage has a natural coérdination with the other 
three. There is an overlapping which should prevail 
throughout the three years of the junior high school. The 
designated purpose of each successive stage cannot be 
fully realized in one brief period allotted to it. In fact, 
some of the stages must extend into the senior high 
school. It is true that in each year of the whole six-year 
secondary period there must be adjustment, exploration, 
provisional choice, and stimulation.” 
Tue Senior High ScHoou 
By the beginning of the tenth grade, the senior high 
school, it should be possible to group pupils for the most 
part in divisions according to their major interests, abili- 
ties, and probable future careers. Inglis gives the follow- 
ing curriculum groupings: 
1. For those entering business and clerical occupations—the 
business and clerical curriculums, including the following more 
or less overlapping curriculums: (a) various forms of office 
and clerical occupations which emphasize such studies as book- 
keeping, stenography and typewriting, correspondence, circu- 
larizing, filing, ete.; (b) merchandising, selling, and store serv- 
ice; (c) any other group of business or clerical arts. 
2. For those entering industrial occupations—the industrial 
curriculums, including curriculums preparing for (a) building 
trades; (b) wood-working trades; (c) metal-working trades; 
(d) machinist trades; (e) any other industrial occupations de- 
sirable and practicable according to the needs of pupils and 
society. 
3. For those entering agricultural occupations—agricultural 
curriculums, including those involving preparation for (a) gen- 
eral farming; (b) animal husbandry; (c) special phases of 
agricultural work according to the needs of pupils and society. 
4. For girls entering domestic occupations and other girls 
not enrolled in other curriculums—domestic curriculums, in-
-P-A-G-E-228
EO EEE 
204 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
cluding those involving (a) preparation for housekeeping and 
home-making; (b) the preparation for nursing as a separate 
occupation; (c) the preparation of skilled workers in institu- 
tions calling for domestic and personal service. Some parts 
of these curriculums may well overlap industrial occupations in 
the textile and clothing trades. 
5. For pupils entering higher institutions—preparatory cur- 
riculums, including those preparing (a) for the academic col- 
lege; (b) the technical or other special college; (c) the normal 
school. 
6. For pupils whose future activities cannot yet be deter- 
mined with any assurance—the general curriculum. In this cur- 
riculum the basis of the selection of studies should involve fun- 
damental and diagnostic forms of education. 
7. In some of the largest schools it is practicable to establish 
other special curriculums, for example, for music and fine arts.1 
The curriculum of the senior high school. The modern 
curriculum organization is made up of three groups of 
subjects: constants, variables, and free electives. The 
constants include the subjects which should be required 
of all pupils in the senior high school. These constants 
make possible the development of a certain amount of 
like-mindedness, a unity in thought, habits, ideals, and 
standards which are absolutely necessary for the welfare 
and permanence of a democracy. Just as the school must 
take advantage of the common characteristics of human- 
ity, so it must likewise utilize the individual differences. 
To be happy a man must have much in common with his 
fellows, and to be useful he must have something that 
they have not. Thus the school must likewise take advan- 
tage of the differences among individuals in order to 
develop social efficiency. The variables include those sub- 
jects which provide for a specialized education, such as 
commerce, industry, agriculture, home economics, profes- 
sional, and academic. The free electives include those

Education. Houghton Mifflin Company. Used by permission,
-P-A-G-E-229
REORGANIZATION OF EDUCATION 205 
subjects which should be left to the unrestricted choice 
of the pupil regardless of the curriculum he may select. 
It is extremely difficult to determine the exact propor- 
tions which should be given to constants, variables, and 
free electives. Inglis suggests “that approximately two- 
fifths of the total time should be devoted to constants in 
the curriculum organization, approximately two-fifths to 
the coérdinate studies of some one curriculum, and 
approximately one-fifth to studies according to the unre- 
stricted election of the pupil.” 
Senior high school pupils. There are at least four 
groups of pupils that must be considered in the organi- 
zation of the high-school curriculums. One group will 
continue their schooling beyond the secondary school in 
some college or university. This group consists of those 
who will very probably enter the professions of law, 
ministry, engineering, medicine, teaching, and business 
administration. The second group consists of those who 
will graduate from high school but will not continue their 
education in some higher institution of learning. These 
boys and girls will enter relatively high-grade positions 
in the commercial, industrial, and agricultural fields. The 
third group will remain in high school until the close of 
the tenth or eleventh grade and will enter similar occu- 
pations perhaps not of as high type as those of the second 
group. The fourth group consists of those pupils who 
will receive a year or less of high-school work. The 
majority of this group will be recruited into the skilled 
and unskilled trades. The difference in the type of 
training given to these four groups will vary with the 
character and needs of the community and of the high- 
school boys and girls. 
These four groups show the extremely varied char-   
1[bid, page 690. 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
206 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
acter of the high-school population—a condition due in 
part to social, economic, and vocational differences, and 
in part to individual differences in age, interests, and 
mental ability. This varied nature of the high-school 
groups suggests two major problems. The first of these 
concerns individual needs and the second, the develop- 
ment of commonality, a certain degree of social unity and 
like-mindedness. The multiplicity of interests and needs 
involved will naturally require a broadening of the cur- 
riculum, for the studies suitable for one person or group 
would be unsuited to another. The modern high school 
with its variety of personalities, abilities, social standing, 
and ideals furnishes a wonderful opportunity to develop 
the individual for efficient membership in a democratic 
society. 
The purpose and function of the senior high school. 
American educators are not in perfect agreement as to 
the real purpose and function of the modern high school. 
Should the high school be committed to the policy of 
general training, college preparation, or vocational effi- 
ciency? It has been generally conceded that the high 
school should afford pupils an opportunity to prepare for 
college or university. What this preparation should be 
has not been so well agreed upon by the representatives 
of the secondary schools and of the colleges. The col- 
leges have urged that the high school should provide at 
least one course of study which should meet the entrance 
requirements of the university. The representatives of 
the high schools have generally insisted that whatever is 
good preparation for life is good preparation for college. 
The college men have emphasized those specific subjects 
that would be the best preparation for doing college work 
most effectively. The college men have in their argu-  
-P-A-G-E-231
REORGANIZATION OF EDUCATION 207 
ments what appears to be an underlying assumption that 
the courses which prepare students for college are at the 
same time the best preparation for the practical duties of 
life. This raises a most difficult question: “What knowl- 
edge is of most worth?” The question seems to be whether 
training in any one particular subject or group of sub- 
jects has a monopoly over other subjects in developing 
individual and social efficiency. 
The senior high school and vocational training. What 
type of courses should be given those pupils who will not 
go on to college? One group of men advocate the estab- 
lishment of a high school which shall be purely voca- 
tional. The purpose of this type of school is to make 
the individual industrially efficient in commercial work— 
practical mechanics, agriculture, sewing, cooking, ete. 
This narrow type of school is very likely to overlook the 
important fact that vocational efficiency is only one factor 
in social efficiency. Good citizenship and an ever grow- 
ing personality are necessary elements which must not 
be overlooked in the education of any individual. A man 
may become a very efficient printer and use this knowl- 
edge of printing to make counterfeit money. Another 
man may use his expert knowledge of penmanship to 
become a forger. Still another man may use his sci- 
entific knowledge of chemistry to invent an infernal 
machine to destroy his fellowman. 
It should always be remembered that any training to be 
of real value must make provision for the development 
and enrichment of an ethical or moral life. If training 
consists of mere drill and routine—that is, teaching a man 
to do a specific thing in a definite and fixed way, develop- 
ing no vital enthusiasm and arousing no deep-seated sym- 
pathies—then there can be no enrichment of life, no
-P-A-G-E-232
  208 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
growth, no education. A system of training that does 
not provide for growth along many lines becomes a means 
of developing a caste system—a system in which a few 
do the thinking while the great majority are not sup- 
posed to be in need of thinking or of understanding 
things as they are. 
Vocational training must develop a wider range of 
activities, or as Bode says: 
. .. greater attention to the broad aspects and less attention, 
if need be, to the special features of the occupation for which 
preparation is made. The prospective plumber would relate his 
special knowledge to the principles of physics and mechanics; 
the prospective salesman would broaden out, perhaps in the direc- 
tion of industry and economics. The point is that vocational 
training can move in either direction. It can utilize special 
knowledge so as to get a wider perspective, or it can follow a 
course of study in which the aim is not appreciation but effi- 
ciency and production, and which is content to limit the size of 
the man by the size of his job. Fundamentally, the issue in 
vocational training is the question whether the individual is to be 
regarded as a means or as an end, whether he is to be trained so 
as to become an effective mechanism or to cultivate experiences 
that bring progressive enlargement and fullness of life.1 
Democracy and the senior high school. Since the high 
school is the school of the people, it must serve the inter- 
ests of the majority who do not go to college as well as 
the interests of the minority who do go. The growing 
spirit of democracy will probably forbid two distinct 
types of secondary schools: one for the classes and one 
for the masses; one for the thinkers and one for the 
toilers. The high school must make it possible for each 
member of the four groups discussed to develop into an 
individual socially efficient. This means that high-school

boys and girls should have the opportunity to develop 
the knowledge and skills which will enable them to sup- 
port themselves and to contribute something to the wel- 
fare of society. In addition to knowledge and skill the 
high school must develop an attitude of mind that will 
make each individual an agreeable and helpful member 
of society. 
Questions and Problems 
1. Compare the relative advantages of the 8-4 and the 6-3-3 
plans for organization in the publie schools. 
2. Compare and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages 
of a single continuous twelve-grade system without any divi- 
sions. 
3. Read again the summary of the functions of the ele- 
mentary schocl on age 191. What changes would you make 
in this list if you were summarizing the functions of the junior 
high school? Of the senior high school? 
4, What conclusions do you draw from Question 3? 
5. How may we scientifically determine ‘‘the objectives of 
life in terms of different needs’’? 
6. What is meant by the ‘‘exploratory’’ function of the 
junior high school? Give examples. 
7. What is meant by ‘‘preview’’ as a function of the junior 
high school? Give examples. 
8. What is meant by ‘‘stimulation’’ as a function of the 
junior high school? Give examples. 
9. Should the senior high school be committed to a policy 
of general training, or college preparation, or vocational effi- 
ciency? Should the senior high school combine these three? 
What would be the results of the combination? If not a com- 
bination of these three, which should be emphasized? Is there 
a conflict between these three functions?

CHAPTER XII 
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE 
AMERICAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Tur FEpERAL GOVERNMENT IN EDUCATION 
Federal land grants. No mention is made of education 
in the Constitution of the United States. This means that 
education is numbered among those activities that are 
left to the individual states. In spite of this fact the 
Federal Government, since an early date, has interested 
itself in education. It has not attempted to control and 
direct the public schools, but it has at various times made 
grants of land and money to aid the states in the educa- 
tion of the children. All types of public schools have 
benefited by this policy. 
Tn (1785 i; Federal Government made its first contri- 
bution to’public education. In connection with an ordi- 
nance organizing the Northwest Territory, Congress 
decreed that the sixteenth section of each township in 
that territory should be set aside for “the maintenance 
of public schools within said township.” The states 
carved out of that territory and all states that have been 
admitted to the Union since have received generous gifts 
of land or money from Congress for public education. 
The first of these gifts for public education made by 
the Federal Government was given to the townships. 
212
-P-A-G-E-237
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 213 
Later, Congress deemed it advisable to give the land 
directly to the state. The practice of giving land to 
the township made the distribution very unequal. One 
township would receive land that was valuable, while 
another township would get land that was practically 
worthless. When the land was given to the state, each 
township shared equally in all sales. After a time Con- 
gress increased its gift for public education to two sec- 
tions in each township, and still later, to four sections 
for the last states that came into the Union. 
The gifts of the Federal Government to the states have 
constituted a magnificent endowment for public educa- 
tion. Much of the school land owned by the states has 
been sold and the money placed in permanent school 
funds and the interest used for educational purposes. ° 
There is still a considerable amount of the land owned 
by the states. In some of them it contains valuable 
deposits of coal and iron, the schools receiving large 
incomes from leases. Other school lands have large areas 
of timber that is increasing in value each year. Some 
states lease their school land and use the income for the 
public schools. The school land situation in the different 
states makes a very interesting subject for study. Almost 
every kind of situation will be found, varying from a 
state that has lost its entire school fund, to the state 
that has been so wise in the administration of its lands 
and moneys that it has a very large school fund. Thus 
the Federal Government by giving these lands has estab- 
lished the significant precedent of aiding public education. 
The second notable gift of the United States Goy- 
ernment to education came in 1862 when the Morrill
-P-A-G-E-238
214 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
Lincoln. This act set aside certain lands to be used by l 
the states in establishing colleges of agriculture and 
mechanical arts. It was followed in 1887 by the Hatch 
Act, which provided for an appropriation of money for 
the establishment and maintenance of agricultural experi- 
ment stations in connection with the colleges that had 
been established under the Morrill Act. Thus through 
this and certain other legislation the United States Gov- 
ernment has definitely adopted the policy of giving finan- 
cial assistance to higher education. 
Still another type of education was endowed by the 
United States Government when Congress passed the 
Smith-Hughes Act in 1917. By it the Federal Govern- 
ment appropriates large sums of money each year for 
the teaching of industrial arts, home economies, and agri- 
culture in the various states. The act is administered 
by the Federal Board for Vocational Education. In 
common with many other acts passed by Congress, it pro- 
vides that for each dollar the United States Government 
appropriates the state must appropriate another dollar. 
Hundreds of school systems are now getting the benefit 
of this measure. This further goes to show that the 
United States Government has committed itself to the 
plan of giving money to the states for educational 
purposes. 
These are but a few of the educational activities 
of the Federal Government. However. they establish 
the fact that the United States Government has many 
times aided public education—elementary, secondary, and 
higher—in the various states. The Government has also 
established many bureaus with educational functions. 
The schools at West Point and Annapolis for the training 
of army and navy officers, and the schools for the edu-
-P-A-G-E-239
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 215 
» cation of the Indians and the inhabitants of territories 
acquired by the Government, are under the direct control 
of the Federal Government. 
The United States Bureau of Education. In 1867 by 
an act of Congress a federal Department of Education 
was established with a Secretary of Education in the 
President’s Cabinet. The following year, before this 
department had any opportunity to function, it was 
reduced to a bureau and placed in the Department of 
the Interior. At the present time, as far as the National 
Government is concerned, education is officially repre- 
sented by this bureau in the Department of the Interior. 
The United States is the only great nation of the world 
that does not have a Secretary of Education. When the 
President calls his advisers together to consider the great 
problems of America, he has two men to advise him con- 
cerning preparation for war and no one to say a word 
for education. Labor and commerce, and even the Post 
Office, are represented in the President’s official family, but 
the greatest enterprise in America—public education—is 
left unrepresented. A bill now before Congress pro- 
vides for the reéstablishment of a Department of Educa- 
tion and a Secretary of Education in the President’s 
Cabinet. It further provides that the United States Gov- 
ernment shall subsidize certain types of education that 
the states have not as yet adequately provided for. 
These are the removal of illiteracy, the Americanization 
of the foreigner, physical education, and the preparation 
of an adequate number of teachers. The bill also pro- 
vides an appropriation to help equalize the cost of edu- 
cation among the several states. A determined fight for 
this bill is being waged by a large group of teachers and 
administrators.

    216 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
Tue Stare AND THE SCHOOLS 
As was pointed out at the beginning of this chapter, 
the control of public education is vested in the state. 
It is not vested in the counties or school districts. These 
subdivisions are creations of the state. In practically 
every state in the Union the question of educational con- 
trol has been decided by the supreme court. In each 
case the basic question has been: “Do the schools belong 
to the local community or to the state?” In every decision 
the court has ruled that the schools belong to the state 
and not to the county or local school district. In think- 
ing of public education in America this point should be 
kept in mind. If a district hires teachers, purchases 
textbooks, builds a schoolhouse, or does anything else in 
the administration of the schools within the district, it 
does so with the sanction of the state and in accordance 
with state laws. A school district cannot adopt a budget 
and levy a school tax unless given permission to do so, 
and then it must raise its funds subject to the limitations 
of the state tax laws. 
However, no state in America exercises direct control 
of its schools. It has been found best to delegate a large 
amount of power and authority to the counties and school 
districts. This is but the natural functioning of demo- 
eratic government. The same citizens that make up the 
various school districts constitute the state. The same 
voters elect the state legislators that elect the school 
board members. Hence, it is possible to delegate large 
powers to the local government if a majority of the people 
so desire. The amount of authority delegated to the 
local school districts varies widely in the different states. 
Every state has an organized department of education 
which directs the educational work, but the type of organ-
-P-A-G-E-241
  ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 217 
ization varies greatly. Usually it is headed by a state 
board of education and a chief executive officer. The 
boards and executive officers differ considerably as to quali- 
fications, election, duties, and responsibilities. 
State boards of education. There are several different 
methods of creating a state board of education. One 
method is to have a board made up, ex officio, of state offi- 
cers. Such a system prevails in Colorado and in several 
other states. A board made up, ex officio, of state officers 
is liable to the weakness of not making education its pri- 
mary interest. All of the members are elected for other 
purposes. They must make their record in other fields. 
Hence, if anything is to be slighted, it will probably be 
education. 
Some state boards are composed of school men. The 
state of Washington has such a board. It is made up 
of the heads of various state educational institutions and 
other designated school executives. In a board of this 
type the tendency is for the members to attempt to do 
executive work instead of the legislative work the board 
is supposed to do. Each member of this board sees the 
problems to be dealt with, not only as they affect the state, 
but also as they affect his particular school. A state uni- 
versity president, for example, generally has his hands 
full securing adequate support for his own institution, 
and might be seriously hindered in getting a correct per- 
spective of the education affairs of the entire state. The 
same is true of the other executives who are members of 
the board. 
in some states the board of education is elected by 
popular vote. This is true in Michigan. Such a board 
is usually made up of school men. The value of a lay 
board is not appreciated by the average voter; therefore, 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
218 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
school men are nearly always nominated and elected. 
Since such a board is made up of school men, it is in 
danger of the same weaknesses as a board of ex officio 
school men, as pointed out in the preceding paragraph. 
Perhaps the best type of state board is a small group of 
laymen appointed by the governor. Massachusetts has 
such a board. <A lay board does not attempt to assume ex- 
ecutive functions, but legislates and works through a state 
school executive, as, for example, the state commissioner 
of education. Its members have an impartial concern for 
the educational welfare of the entire state rather than 
for some one institution. There has been much discussion 
among educators as to whether the state board should 
be appointed or elected. At present, authorities prefer 
the appointed board because it assures a lay board. It 
was pointed out previously that an elected board will tend 
to be made up of school men. Provision should also be 
made for a term of office long enough so that no governor 
can appoint a majority of the members in a single term. 
The duties of the state board should parallel closely the 
duties of a city school board. It should always work 
through a chief executive officer and a corps of assistants. 
It should pass on all matters of school policy, these mat- 
ters being brought to it by the chief executive officer. The 
members should have no authority as individual mem- 
bers of the board, but should function only through the 
activities of the board as a whole. 
The state superintendent or commissioner ef education. 
A state school system must have a chief executive officer. 
He is usually called the superintendent of public instruc- 
tion or the commissioner of education. His powers and 
duties vary widely in the different states. 
There are many different ways of selecting the chief
-P-A-G-E-243
  ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 219 
executive of a state school system. In many cases he 
is elected by popular vote, as in California. The ten- 
dency of the time is away from this popular election. 
There is always danger of a state superintendent who is 
merely a politician. It is true that good men are many 
times elected to this office, but poor ones are quite often 
selected. Most good school men refuse to give up a 
position to become a politica! candidate. The state super- 
intendent should be the best school man in the state. 
Yet it is almost impossible to get a city superintendent or 
a university president even to consider this office when 
it is elective. It is evident that this officer must be 
selected by some other method if the best men are to be 
attracted to the work. 
The best means of obtaining a good school executive 
is selection by a board of education, itself well selected 
as outlined on page 218. This is the method employed 
in selecting a city superintendent of schools, and it has 
proved to be a wise method. It has attracted to this 
work some of the ablest men of the profession. The 
same method is used in selecting a president for a college 
or university, and here also it has proved successful. 
The state commissioner of education should be the best 
educator in the state. He should be progressive and 
should be a real leader in educational thought. When 
a state has a commissioner of this caliber, backed up by 
a wisely chosen board, the commissioner is able to assume 
his logical place as educational leader of the state. 
State control of education. It was explained previously 
that the state is supreme in the control of education. 
It therefore follows that all regulations concerning taxa- 
tion, certification, school buildings, and all other matters 
of education must be made by the state. There is a
-P-A-G-E-244
220 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
great variation as to the amount of centralization in the 
state school systems. A state may prescribe a definite 
course of study and compel all schools to follow it. It 
may allow each school district to adopt its own course 
of study, or it may prescribe a course for the rural schools 
and give the city schools freedom to do as they please. 
In some cases the textbooks are prescribed by the state 
department and their use is compelled through all school 
systems. In other cases each district is allowed to select 
its own textbooks. Some states allow first-class dis- 
tricts to certificate teachers. In other states the state 
department does all of the certification. However, the 
tendency at present is toward greater centralization of 
authority. This is particularly true in the case of certifi- 
eation of teachers. The state is also taking over more 
and more the task of financing the public schools, and 
many states have even prescribed regulations for the 
construction of schoolhouses. In all states the laws regu- 
late the levying of taxes and issuing of bonds for the 
purpose of raising money for schools. It is possible to 
go too far in the centralization of authority, but in these 
matters mentioned present practice seems to show that 
the state is much more effective in meeting the problems of 
administration than the smaller units would be. 
All state departments require an accounting from each 
district of the state each year. These reports usually 
take two forms: (1) child accounting, (2) finance account- 
ing. In the child accounting it is necessary to report to 
the state various data concerning the number of children 
living in the district, the enrollment in the publie schools, 
the daily attendance, and other data of general interest 
in educational matters. In the finance reports it is 
necessary to furnish information as to the amount of

GEORGE DRAYTON STRAYER 
George Drayton Strayer has achieved much 
in the field of educational administration. The 
work of the city superintendent has been pro- 
fessionalized largely through the work of Dr. 
Strayer and his associates. He is also a leader 
in administrative research.
-P-A-G-E-246

-P-A-G-E-247
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 221 
money spent, where the money came from, and exactly 
what it was spent for. 
The state is each year taking a larger and larger part 
in school finance. At the present time practically all 
states have permanent school funds, which in most cases 
were built up through the sale and rental of lands given 
by the Federal Government. These permanent school 
funds are invested, and each year the interest is distrib- 
uted among the various districts of the state. In some 
cases this amount is increased through various types of 
state taxation. 
The money which is distributed by the state among the 
various districts is apportioned according to census or 
attendance or on some other basis. The most common 
method, which is also the poorest, is to apportion money 
on the basis of school census. This gives a certain amount 
for each child of school age living in the district. Thus 
the school district receives money for children who have 
left school or who are going to private schools. Hence, 
this kind of apportionment does not encourage the dis- 
tricts to keep children in school. It is much better to 
distribute the money on the basis of the number of chil- 
dren in attendance. If the length of the term is taken 
into consideration too, the distribution is still more just. 
- It is also valuable for a state to subsidize various types 
of education, and to pay a bonus to districts on the basis 
of the number of properly trained teachers that are 
employed in the schools. This is being done in Califor- 
nia and in several other states. 
THE CouNTY AND THE SCHOOLS 
The counties into which the states are divided vary 
greatly in size. From an educational standpoint they
-P-A-G-E-248
222, AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
also differ widely in importance. In some states the 
county is next in importance to the state. In others it 
has practically no significance. In the Southern states 
the county is very important as an educational subdivi- 
sion. In New England it has practically no function in 
education, the town and the district being very much 
more important. 
The county as a division in education should be of great 
importance. It is a much more desirable system than 
that of the district. This is true from every standpoint. 
Such a system distributes the tax burden more equitably. 
In states where the school district is the unit of taxation 
the tax load is very uneven. It is not uncommon to find 
two adjoining districts, one paying an enormous school 
tax, and the other practically no tax at all to maintain 
the same educational opportunity. This is particularly 
true in those states, like Washington, where the railroads 
are taxed by the local school district. Where the county 
is the unit of taxation the burden is better distributed. 
Each district in the county pays the same school tax and 
receives the same educational advantages. 
The county unit is more desirable from the standpoint 
of school supervision. With the district as the unit, 
supervision is impossible anywhere except in the city 
districts. The county should have as good a system of 
supervision as any city, and this is possible with the 
county unit. It is also possible to develop and administer 
a better course of study. The Baltimore County Course 
of Study, which has attracted wide attention during the 
past few years, is a product of a system where the county 
is important in educational administration. 
The type of county organization differs widely in the 
various states. In fact, there are about as many different
-P-A-G-E-249
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 223 
types of county control as there are types of state con- 
trol. In general, each county has an executive officer, 
usually called the county superintendent of schools. This 
officer is usually elected by popular vote, although in a 
few states he is appointed by a county board of educa- 
tion. The latter plan is preferable. If the county 
superintendent is to do a real piece of work, he must have 
a corps of assistants. He must have sufficient clerical help 
to be free from the details of statistical reports. He 
should also have assistant supervisors to help him ade- 
quately supervise the schools of the county. 
The county as a unit in education is gradually increas- 
ing in importance, while the importance of the district 
is waning. The rural schools of America will be vastly 
benefited when there is more consolidation and when the 
county is made a strong unit in taxation and adminis- 
tration. 
Tue Crry ScHoou System 
Every city school system in America derives from the 
state its right to exist as a separate school unit. Acting 
under state authorization most cities organize and con- 
duct their own schools. The relation of the city school 
system to the state varies widely in different states. In 
some cases the cities are given almost complete inde- 
pendence. In others almost every act of the city system 
is determined by the laws of the state. 
The school board. Practically every city school system 
is controlled by a board known as the school board or the 
board of education. They vary in size in the different 
cities. The table given on the next page shows the size 
of school boards in certain cities having a population of 
250,000 or more.

The largest school board in this group of cities is made 
up of fifteen members while the smallest has but five. 
The present tendency is away from large boards. Practi- 
cally every change in size in recent years has been from 
a large board to a smaller one. Five or seven members 
are believed by present authorities to be the ideal 
arrangement. 
There are many different methods of securing members
-P-A-G-E-251
  
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 295 
for a school board. They may be elected, appointed by 
the mayor or judges, or the membership may be self- 
perpetuating. The best method is election. As shown 
in the table, it is used in 15 of the 24 largest cities of 
the United States. In fact, it is the most common method 
used at the present time. In recent years many cities 
have changed from other methods to election. When 
school board members are elected, for obvious reasons the 
following conditions are essential: (1) They should be 
elected from the city at large and not by districts or 
wards; (2) they should be elected on a non-partisan 
ticket; (3) the election should not be on the day when 
other city officers are elected; (4) the elections should 
not be held more often than once in two years; and (5) 
the term of office should be long enough to prevent a 
majority of the board being elected at any one time. 
In New York City the school board is appointed by the 
mayor. This method of selection is used in many other 
cities, particularly in the eastern part of the country. 
A board that is a creation of the city government is 
always tempted to mix in city politics. In spite of the 
seeming advisability of an appointed state board, such 
a method does not function satisfactorily in city school 
management. In the city the people are so close to 
their school system and so much better acquainted with 
the merits of the candidates, that election, as stated 
above, is the best method. Furthermore there is no 
chance of electing school men already burdened with their 
own executive duties, to a city board. 
Self-perpetuating school boards are rarely found. Un- 
der this system, when a member dies or resigns, his place 
is filled by selection by the remaining members. This 
is not only unsatisfactory, but it is un-American. A 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  226 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
public school system should be under the control of the 
public. 
All school boards are not vested with the same authority. 
The greatest difference is found in the relationship of the 
school board to the city government in matters of finance. 
In general, there are two types of school systems: (1) 
Some city school systems are fiscally independent. The 
school board is allowed by the state to levy taxes or cause 
some other agent to levy for it, under the limitations of 
the state laws. (2) Other school boards are fiscally de- 
pendent. They must submit their school budgets to the 
city officials. The municipal government is given the right, 
by the state, to reduce the school budget or adopt it as it 
is presented to them. 
In the last few years several American cities have 
changed from fiscal dependence to fiscal independence. It 
is believed that fiscal independence produces much better 
schools. If a school board knows that it can levy enough 
money to run the system adequately, it is possible to make 
plans in advance and know that there will be money 
enough to carry these plans out. Most of the western 
cities like Denver, Portland, Seattle, and St. Louis are 
fiscally independent, while Detroit, Minneapolis, New York, 
and Baltimore are examples of cities that are fiscally 
dependent. 
The City Superintendent of Schools. The most impor- 
tant function of the city school board is the selection 
of a superintendent of schools. This superintendent 
should be the executive head of the system. He should 
administer the schools. The board of education should 
act upon matters brought to it by the superintendent. 
It should only legislate on matters of school policy. The 
details of employing teachers, buying supplies, writing 
the course of study, supervising the schools, and all other 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 27 
educational matters should be under the control of the 
superintendent and his assistants. 
The city school superintendent usually has several as- 
sistants. Each assistant superintendent is responsible to 
the superintendent for a certain phase of the work of the 
system. For example, it is common to have an assistant 
superintendent in charge of the senior high schools. When 
matters concerning the senior high schools come to the 
superintendent, and through him to the board if necessary, 
they come through the assistant superintendent in charge. 
Each school in a city system is in charge of a principal. 
He is responsible for the organization and administration 
of his school. The supervision of instruction is the prin- 
cipal’s chief task. It is necessary also for the principal to 
make the required reports, represent the school in the 
community, and in many ways become the most vital factor 
in a city school system. It is impossible to have a good 
school organization unless the principals of the schools are 
well fitted for their work. 
The city school system in America represents the great- 
est advance in education. In the cities we find the best 
instruction, the best supplies, and in general, the best 
teaching. The adoption of the larger units of supervision 
in the rural districts will enable them to have many of 
the advantages of the city in matters of supervision and 
administration. 
Questions and Problems

SUMMARY OF PART FOUR 
In order that the student may properly understand and 
interpret the present organization of the American public 
schools, Chapter X described the historical development of 
their three divisions. Historically, each of the three divi- 
sions—elementary, secondary, and higher—springs from 
separate and distinct sources and develops to considerable 
proportions independently of the others. The three divi- 
sions are now joined together forming the “American edu- 
cational ladder,” and our public school system now stands, 
after three centuries of growth, complete in form only. In 
organic relation, in sharpness of province, and in distine- 
tiveness of function, these divisions are not yet satisfac- 
torily articulated. 
Chapter XI analyzed the present reorganization of ele- 
mentary and secondary education. The reorganization of 
a school system, to be of real value, must be a functional, 
as well as an administrative, one. The functional reorgan- 
ization has to do with changes in the curriculum and sub- 
ject-matter. The needs of the individual and the needs of 
society are determining factors in curriculum revision. 
There is a growing tendency to consider grades one to six 
inclusive as constituting the elementary school, and the 
secondary school period as commencing with the seventh 
grade and extending through the twelfth. The six-year 
secondary period is divided into the three-year junior high 
school and the three-year senior high school. 
It was shown in Chapter XII that the Federal Govern- 
ment has given aid to education in the various states in

spite of the fact that each state has control over its own 
educational system. The states differ widely in their 
organizations for educational purposes. However, most 
states have a state board of education and a chief execu- 
tive officer. The state usually passes on to the counties 
and districts most of the immediate control over educa- 
tion. The county is an important school unit in the 
South and West, but does not have an important function 
in the North. The greatest development of education in 
America is found in the city school systems where the best 
supervision is possible. 
As a fitting conclusion to this brief survey of the great 
field of education in America, Part Five takes up a dis- 
cussion of the development of modern education and of 
the great work of education as a maker and preserver of 
democracy.

THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN EDUCATION 
Tur Extension oF Epucation 
Informality of early education. In approaching the 
study of educational evolution we should remember that 
it did not begin with the schools. According to Bode: 
Education as a practice extends back as far as the beginning 
of human existence. Even in the lowest forms of human society 
some education is required for the perpetuation of the community 
life. The child must learn how to make clothes and utensils, how 
to hunt and fish, how to raise crops, and how to comport himself 
as a member of his group. But this learning is accomplished 
without any necessary reference to theory, and even without any 
significant use of formal educational agencies.t 
Education becomes a distinctive and separate under- 
taking only among civilized people. Among savages and 
barbarians education is informal, irregular, and uncertain, 
as it was also in earlier civilizations, but in advanced 
society it is well organized and institutionalized. 
There have been three main lines of advance in our 
educational development: first, the extension of educa- 
tional advantages from the classes to the masses; second, 
a transfer of education from private to public control; 
third, a gradual change in subject-matter and method. 
The extension of education from the classes to the 
masses. It is possible to conceive of society as a pyramid 
of social classes. In the earlier civilizations and even up

  234 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
to a comparatively recent time, at the top of the pyramid 
were the higher nobility, the churchmen, and the lay no- 
bility. Next came a larger group, the lower nobility and 
the higher commercial classes. The third group was larger 
still and composed of the upper middle class, the well-to-do 
merchants, manufacturers, large landholders, and profes- 
sional men. The fourth class, a still larger group, was 
made up of small shopkeepers, craftsmen, and farmers. 
Finally, at the base of the pyramid, was the largest group 
of all, the day laborers. 
Formal education started at the top of the pyramid and 
has slowly worked its way downward. The first schools 
were organized and maintained for the very select few. 
In oriental nations—Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, and Persia 
-—the priests were generally the teachers and the chief 
beneficiaries of education. It was not until the rise of the 
Greek states that any wide extension of education took 
place. But the much heralded Athenian democracy was 
in reality an oligarchy based upon slavery. It is true the 
free citizens of Greece received a general education, but 
at least four out of every five inhabitants were slaves. The 
Roman republic showed some signs of a tendency toward 
popular education, but her imperial dream of a world 
empire drew her attention away from the real need of 
the masses. 
When Rome fell, the chaos of the Dark Ages almost com- 
pletely destroyed the education and culture of the past. 
Education returned to the oriental status, where the priests 
were the teachers and beneficiaries of education. Even 
the priests were in possession of little knowledge, for 
their opportunities for study and learning were small. 
But under great difficulties they kept up the work. The 
monasteries were the centers of what learning there was, 
those at Jarrow and Whitby, in England, the first under

the leadership of the “Venerable Bede,” being espe- 
cially noteworthy. These conditions, however, were gradu- 
ally improved, and education was extended widely among 
the clergy and the higher nobility. Then it spread down- 
ward to the second class, the lower nobility, and at the 
opening of the modern period of history the third class, 
the well-to-do commercial and professional groups, were 
receiving the benefits of organized education. From these 
three groups education has gradually come within the pos- 
sibilities of the ambitious and able of all classes. 
The spread of popular education as a result of the indus- 
trial revolution. The industrial revolution, which began 
in the latter part of the eighteenth century, ushered in the 
machine age with its transfer of industry from the home 
to the small shop and the factory, and therefore changed 
the whole economic, educational, and social scheme of 
things. The industrial revolution brought large groups of 
people together into the manufacturing centers, and thus 
made possible the rapid growth of cities. All this made 
conditions favorable for the rise of public education. The 
result was that the state gradually took over the schools 
which had been, from early times, under the direction and 
authority of the church. 
Prior to the revolution the average man gained his train- 
ing and education through an apprenticeship to an occu- 
pation. This usually lasted seven years and not only gave 
the individual training in performing the mechanical proc- 
esses involved in the trade, but also a knowledge of raw 
materials, their production and consumption, and the mar- 
keting of the finished product. He also had dealings with 
many classes of men. All this training developed in the 
individual a certain amount of initiative and judgment. 
But with the coming of the factory system the differentia- 
tion of labor necessitated each man’s performing a simple
-P-A-G-E-262
236 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
task day after day. He could become an expert in his 
specitic task in a very short time. This cut down the period 
of apprenticeship from seven years to a few months, and 
at the same time it limited the number of things a man 
learned to do. 
Some steps were then necessary to prevent these men 
from becoming mere machines. The new working condi- 
tions demanded broader training. Formal education was 
widely enough spread to include them all in its benefits. 
Ingenuity and skill required in production through power 
machinery called for trained minds. Leaders were needed 
to push forward this new industrial organization. Short- 
ening the period of apprenticeship released several years 
of youthful energy which was diverted into the schools. 
Additional leisure time was acquired and the laborer re- 
ceived more money. For the first time in history the idea 
of educating the manual laborer began to take hold of the 
imagination. It remained, however, for the twentieth cen- 
tury to make popular education widespread. Society is 
now beginning to realize that just as it was necessary to 
give the men entering the professions an education, a train- 
ing for their work, so it is just as necessary to train the 
laborer for his work; and today vocational education is one 
of the big problems with which society is wrestling. Just 
as society saw the need for law schools, medical schools, 
and theological schools, and later engineering schools, so 
today it is organizing teachers colleges, commercial schools, 
agricultural schools, industrial and technical schools, and 
schools of household arts. 
The changes in subject-matter and method. As educa- 
tion is pushed down the social pyramid we can see the 
change in subject-matter, method, and aims: the change 
from the theoretical to the practical; from the abstract to 
the concrete; from pure science to applied science; from
-P-A-G-E-263
  
THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN EDUCATION 237 
general psychology to educational and child psychology ; 
from pure sociology to educational sociology ; from general 
chemistry to household chemistry; from anatomy and 
physiology to individual and social hygiene; from the in- 
dividual aim of education to the social aim; from the dis- 
cussion of such problems as how many angels could dance 
on the end of a needle to the problem of how we can 
classify children in order to adapt subject-matter to the 
capacity of the learner. 
In the past the elementary schools were limited to the 
tools of learning, the three R’s;! then came geography, 
grammar, language, music, history, nature study, civics, 
literature, physiology. Now we are revising these studies, 
adapting them to the interests, abilities, and real needs of 
boys and girls, and we are adding many new subjects such 
as shop work, art, home economics, general science, social 
science, and community problems. We shall always find 
it necessary to teach the three R’s in the elementary school, 
and in addition we must use the material which is pro- 
vided in science, literature, and history, for the purpose 
of forming certain ideals and to give new significance to 
the facts of our complicated everyday living. As we come 
to recognize more clearly the function of education in a 
democracy, we shall stress more and more that type of 
education which will explain the meaning and purposes 
of a democratie society and which will give larger oppor- 
tunity for actual participation in the duties of citizenship, 
even while boys and girls are still enrolled in our elemen- 
tary schools.

ter.? The method used in the first geography teaching was 
constant drill in location, together with the memorizing of

lists of geographical features. During this first stage of 
geography teaching the pupil was taught that Switzerland 
is located in central Europe, and is bounded by France, 
Germany, Austria, and Italy. Its chief cities are Zurich, 
Basel, Geneva, Berne, and Lausanne. Its largest lake is 
Geneva, and so on. In the second stage of geography 
teaching memory work was still dominant, but the mate- 
rials to be remembered were the statements of the text- 
books rather than mere lists. "The pupil learned not only 
that Switzerland contains a small lowland in the north 
and the great Alpine ranges in the south, but that the 
Alps are folded mountains highly glaciated, and distin- 
guished by long longitudinal valleys and short transverse 
valleys. In the third and present stage of geography 
teaching the method requires much less memorizing and 
more reasoning on the part of the pupil. Human and 
social geography is emphasized rather than isolated facts 
and locations. 
Geographical facts are now studied in terms of their 
influence on human activities which are within the range 
of the pupil’s own experiences. He learns that Switzer- 
land is famous for its hotels, good roads, tunnels, beautiful 
scenery, toymaking, dairies, and the manufacture of fine 
fabrics, embroideries, and watches. These facts are all 
learned in their relation to the Swiss people. For ex- 
ample, the toys are made in winter when the people are 
not busy on the farms or in taking care of the tourists. 
The Swiss people take advantage of their natural resources. 
Jacking fuel, they have shown exceptional ability in utiliz- 
ing the streams that formerly ran to waste. Railroads and 
trolley lines are run largely by electric power from the 
waterfalls. Because of relatively little fuel and raw ma- 
terial, the Swiss manufacture such articles as watches, fine 
cloths, and delicate embroideries.
-P-A-G-E-266
  
  240 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
While studying these human phases of Switzerland, the 
pupil learns the names and locations of the important 
cities where the manufacturing is carried:on. He also 
learns the rivers that furnish the water power and the 
mountains that provide the wonderful scenery. In the 
same way the physical features, such as climate, soil, and 
minerals are fixed in the pupil’s mind, not by a forced 
process of mechanical drill, but as steps in attaining an 
end. He uses these facts as a means of understanding and 
solving a problem of real social significance. The present 
method of teaching geography makes it possible for the 
pupil to gain knowledge of social value through rich and 
vital experiences. It also enables him to reason from 
eause to effect, to weigh values, to appreciate the influence 
of many different factors, and to understand how one part 
of the world is dependent upon another part. 
The popularizing of education for women. One of the 
most interesting phases of our educational evolution has 
been the popularizing of education for women. None of 
the oriental nations realized that women could be educated. 
Even Greece and Rome with all their grandeur and glory 
neglected this vital necessity. It was only after education 
had become general for men that women began to be ad- 
mitted to the schools. Only a generation ago, or perhaps 
two in our own country, there were grave doubts in the 
public mind as to the possibility and advisability of ex- 
tending education to women. All these fears have since 
been dissipated as women have been admitted to a place 
beside men in classrooms from the kindergarten to the 
university. Starting centuries later than man, woman has 
won a place of equality with him in our schools and even 
threatens to outstrip him in the attainment of universal 
literacy.

Ellwood Patterson Cubberley has worked with 
marked efficiency in many educational fields. 
His contributions to school administration and 
the history of education have been most valuable. 
He has written, in a simple and fascinating style, 
the story of the development of education 
throughout the world. The present position of 
the history of education is largely due to Dr. 
Cubberley’s work.

  THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN EDUCATION 94] 
The disappearance of illiteracy. How great has been 
the progress of education at the base of our social pyramid 
is shown by the rapid disappearance of illiteracy. “In 
France in 1790, 63 per cent of those registering for mar- 
riage were unable to sign their names. In 1910, 4 per 
cent were unable to do so. In England in 1848, 41 per 
cent; 1905, 2 per cent. In Germany in 1875, 24 per cent 
of army recruits; 1908, 2/10 of 1 per cent.’”* The per- 
centage of illiteracy in the United States has been lowered 
during twenty years from 13.3 per cent in 1890 to 10.7 in 
1900, and 7.7 per cent in 1910.2 The amount of illiteracy 
in 1920 was 6 per cent. Dispelling illiteracy is only a 
first step in the march of modern educational progress. 
The masses will not be satisfied with mere ability to read 
and write. They will demand more knowledge, more skill, 
and more refinement and culture. Free popular education 
will grow until the masses will occupy in a few generations 
the plane now reached by the better educated classes. 
The big business of education. The biggest business in 
the United States today is education. Our present public 
educational plant has more than 700,000 teachers, with a 
billion and a half dollars invested in equipment, an an- 
nual budget of over a billion, and an enrollment of over 
twenty million pupils. In a few decades this will all be 
doubled and then still keep on growing. With the appear- 
ance of continuation schools, night schools, and extension 
classes for older people, there is left for the imagination 
an unlimited field for speculation as to the proportion of 
our population that will be enrolled in some form of school 
work under public control fifty years from now.

242 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
OUTSTANDING, PERSONALITIES IN THE History oF 
Movern Epucation 
All great educational movements have been the result of 
the efforts of dominant self-sacrificing personalities. One 
of the best ways to understand and appreciate the real 
significance of educational movements is to trace their 
development through the simple and gradually more and 
more complex stages. This process always brings us face 
to face with great outstanding personalities; personalities 
whose lives have been devoted to the highest end—to the 
service of mankind and to the progress of truth. We 
think of these great personalities as contributions to a life 
which is not of today or yesterday, but of all time. 
The principles underlying modern education may be 
said to have had their beginning in the eighteenth century 
reforms of Rousseau, Pestalozzi, Froebel, and Herbart. At 
this time the schools were controlled by the church, which 
also dominated the state to a large extent. The schools 
existed for the upper classes of society and were auto- 
cratic, expensive, formal, and individual in method. To- 
day the state holds itself responsible for free educational 
opportunities for all. 
Rousseau. Rousseau (1712-1778), in France, revolted 
against the social conditions of his time and attempted to 
overthrow the aristocracy, artificiality, and exploitation 
which abounded. 
Cubberley gives an interesting insight into the social 
conditions of the times: 
Among the middle and upper social classes, particularly on 
the continent of Europe, a stiff artificiality everywhere prevailed. 
Children were dressed and treated as miniature adults, the normal 
activities of childhood were suppressed, and the natural interests 
and emotions of children found little opportunity for expression. 
Wearing powdered and braided hair, long gold-braided coats,
-P-A-G-E-271
THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN EDUCATION 943 
embroidered waistcoats, cockaded hats, and swords, boys were 
treated more as adults than as children. Girls, too, with their 
long dresses, hoops, powdered hair, rouged faces, and demure 
manner, were trained in a, for children, most unnatural manner. 
The dancing master for their manners and graces, and the reli- 
gious instructor to develop in them the ability to read and to go 
through a largely meaningless ceremonial, were the chief guides 
for the period of their childhood.t 
In his Emile (1762) Rousseau attacked the religious and 
social theory as to education then prevailing throughout 
Western Europe. 
For the stiff and unnatural methods in education, under which 
children were dressed and made to behave as adults, the harsh 
discipline of the time, and the excessive emphasis on religious 
instruction and book education, he preached the substitution of 
’ life amid nature, childish ways and sports, parental love, and 
an education that considered the instincts and natural develop- 
ment of children,” 
Rousseau believed that education was the remedy for 
the ills of society and that in the processes of education 
the child should be the center of gravity. The nature of 
the child should determine the nature of the teaching 
rather than the logieal order of subject-matter which was 
developed only to the adult mind. According to Rousseau, 
the child was to be considered as a child and taught as a 
child rather than as a miniature adult. 
Although many of Rousseau’s theories were crude and 
impractical, Cubberley says: 
He may be regarded as the first important writer to sap the 
foundations of the old system of religious education, and to lay 
a basis for a new type of child training. Though Rousseau’s 
enthusiasm took the form of theory run mad, and the educational 
plan he proposed was largely impossible, he nevertheless popu-

larized education, not only in France, but among the reading 
public of the progressive European States as well. 
Pestalozzi. In common with Rousseau, Pestalozzi (1746- 
1825), in Switzerland, emphasized the importance of the 
nature of the child, but he also made a very significant 
contribution. He emphasized the fact that in the educative 
process the child must be thought of in relation to the 
subject-matter. He intended to reduce the educational 
processes to a well-organized routine based on the nature 
and earliest development of the instincts, capacities, and 
powers of the growing child. Pestalozzi’s real contribu- 
tion was his attempt to change the method of teaching chil- 
dren. He attempted to analyze subject-matter into its 
simplest elements. His analysis of subject-matter into its 
elements was often carried to the extreme, and in the light 
of our modern knowledge we can see how crude were his 
attempts. However, the results for education of his ideas 
were very large. 
They, in time, gave aim and purpose to the elementary school 
of the nineteenth century, transforming it from an instrument 
of the church for church ends, to an instrument of society to be 
used for its own regeneration and the advancement of the wel- 
fare of all. The introduction of the study of natural objects in 
place of words, and much talking about what was seen and 
studied instead of parrot-like reproductions of the words of a 
book, revolutionized both the methods and the subject-matter of 
instruction in the developing elementary school. Observation and 
investigation tended to supersede mere memorizing; class discus- 
sion and thinking to supersede the reciting of the words of the 
book; thinking about what was being done to supersede routine 
learning; and class instruction to supersede the wasteful indi- 
vidual teaching which had for so long characterized all school 
work. It meant the reorganization of the work of the vernacular 
school on a modern basis, with class organization and group 
instruction, and a modern-world purpose.”

  THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN EDUCATION 245 
Froebel. Froebel (1782-1852) was a student of the 
theory of Pestalozzi and accepted his principles. His 
original contribution consisted in the fact that he empha- 
sized social participation in the school. He regarded the 
“school as a miniature society in which children learned to 
do by doing. He was deeply impressed with the great 
value of music and play in the education of children. 
Gradually Froebel became convinced that the most needed 
reform in education concerned the early years of childhood. His 
own youth had been most unhappy, and to this phase of educa- 
tion he addressed himself. After a period as a teacher in Switzer- 
land he returned to Germany and opened a school for little 
children in which plays, games, songs, and occupations involving 
self-activity were the dominating characteristics, and in 1840 he 
hit upon the name Kindergarten for it. . . . He saw, more 
clearly than any one before him had done, the unutilized wealth 
of the child’s world; that the child’s chief characteristic is self- 
activity; the desirability of the child finding himself through 
play; and that the work of the school during these early years 
was to supplement the family by drawing out the child and 
awakening the ideal side of his nature. To these ends doing, 
self-activity, and expression became fundamental to the kinder- 
garten, and movement, gesture, directed play, song, color, the 
story, and human activities a part of kindergarten technique. 
Nature study and school gardening were given a prominent place, 
and motor-activity much called into play. Advancing far beyond 
Pestalozzi’s principle of sense-impressions, Froebel insisted on 
motor-activity and learning by doing.t 
Herbart. Herbart (1776-1841) accepted the principles 
of Pestalozzi and made his own contributions to them. He 
advocated education for all and insisted upon knowing and 
doing, not-as an end in themselves, but as a means to an 
ideal, which was character. Herbart paid more attention 
to the technique of teaching than his predecessors, and 
he may be said to have been the first to develop a real

technique of teaching children. Although his method of 
teaching was unsound according to the new psychology, 
nevertheless his idea that there should be a scientific theory 
of the learning process was a real contribution to the 
seience of education. 
Cubberley gives us an interesting comparison of Herbart 
and Pestalozzi: 
The two men, however, approached the educational problem 
from entirely different angles. Pestalozzi gave nearly all his long 
life to teaching and human service, while Herbart taught only as 
a traveling private tutor for three years, and later a class of 
twenty children in his university practice school. Pestalozzi was 
a social reformer, a visionary, and an impractical enthusiast, but 
Herbart, on the other hand, was a well-trained scholarly thinker, 
who spent the most of his life in the peaceful occupation of a 
professor of philosophy in a German university. It was while at 
K6ningsberg, between 1810 and 1832, and as an appendix to his 
work as professor of philosophy, that he organized a small prac- 
tice school, conducted a pedagogical seminary, and worked out 
his educational theory and method. His work was a careful, 
scholarly attempt at the organization of education as a science, 
carried out amid the peace and quiet which a university atmos- 
phere almost alone affords. He addressed himself chiefly to three 
things: (1) the aim, (2) the content, and (3) the method of 
instruction 
Pionzrr LEADERS IN AMERICAN EpucATION 
Among the pioneer leaders in the field of American edu- 
cation five names stand out prominently: Horace Mann, 
Henry Barnard, Francis Parker, William T. Harris, and 
John Dewey. These first four men represent four distinct 
fields of education; Horace Mann was a leader in educa- 
tional administration; Henry Barnard, our first great 
educational scholar; Francis Parker, a leader in educa- 
‘tional method; and William T. Harris, a leader in edu-

eational philosophy. John Dewey stands as the great 
interpreter in education of the vast changes of the nine- 
teenth century. 
Horace Mann. Through the efforts of Horace Mann 
(1796-1859) the first state normal school in the United 
States was founded and established in 1839 at Lexington, 
Massachusetts. The keen insight and breadth of vision of 
this educational leader are seen in the following quotation 
from an address which he delivered at the founding of one 
of the normal schools: 
Neither the art of printing nor the trial by jury, nor a free 
press, nor free suffrage can long exist to any beneficial and salu- 
tary purpose without schools for training of teachers; for if the 
character and qualifications of teachers be allowed to degenerate, 
the free schools will become pauper schools, and the pauper 
schools will produce pauper souls, and the free press will 
become a false and licentious press, and ignorant voters will 
become venal voters, and through the medium and guise of repub- 
lican forms an oligarchy of profligate men will govern the land; 
nay, the universal diffusion and triumph of all-glorious Chris- 
tianity itself must await the time when knowledge shall be dif- 
fused among men through the instrumentality of good schobls. 
Coiled up in this institution, as in a spring, there is a vigor whose 
uncoiling may wheel the spheres.1 
Today we witness the uncoiling of this spring. Horace 
Mann’s first normal school has multiplied into many 
teacher-training institutions. There are in the United 
States 164 state institutions for the preparation of teach- 
ers; ninety-one of these are giving four years of college 
work, twenty-four, three years, and fifty-two, two years.” 
Horace Mann was also the founder and the first presi- — 
dent of Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio, which was 
the first collegiate institution to open its doors to both men

and women. This school was established in 1853, and 
at the present time Arthur Morgan is conducting a most 
interesting experiment at this same institution in which 
he is combining cultural and technical training.* 
Mann was educated and trained to be a lawyer, but 
he gave up this profession and went into the field of edu- 
cation. When asked by a friend why he changed he re- 
plied, “The interests of a client are small as compared with 
the interests of the next generation. Let the next genera- 
tion be my client.”? As the first secretary of the Massa- 
chusetts State Board of Education, Horace Mann started 
on a most remarkable piece of work in the education of 
public opinion. According to Cubberley: f 
His twelve carefully written reports on the condition of educa- 
tion in Massachusetts and elsewhere, with his intelligent discussion 
of the aims and purposes of public education, occupy a tom- 
manding place in the history of American education, while he 
will always be regarded as perhaps the greatest of the “founders” 
of our American system of free public schools. No one did more 
than he to establish in the minds of the American people the con- 
ception that education should be universal, non-sectarian, and 
free, and that its aim should be social efficiency, civic virtue, and 
character, rather than mere learning or the advancement of sec- 
tarian ends. Under his practical leadership an unorganized and 
heterogeneous series of community school systems was reduced to 
organization and welded together into a state school system, and 
the people of Massachusetts were effectively recalled to their 
ancient belief in and duty toward the education of the people.* 
Henry Barnard, Henry Barnard (1811-1900) did an 
equally important piece of educational work in Connec- 
ticut and Rhode Island. Like Horace Mann, he was edu- 
‘The most striking feature of Mr. Morgan’s plan is the so-called codperative 
idea, under which the student body is divided into two groups for alternating 
periods of five weeks’ study and five weeks’ work. A student attends college 
for five weeks and then goes to work in some industry, business, or professional 
office. Meanwhile, the student’s alternate comes back to college from the posi- 
tion the two have in common.

cated for the law, but he soon turned to teaching and be- 
came deeply interested in education. He traveled widely 
both in this country and in Europe, and was thoroughly 
acquainted with educational and social conditions in both 
countries. During his travels in this country he met such 
men as Marshall, Madison, Preston, Calhoun, Clay, and 
Webster. He journeyed extensively in Europe, paying 
especial attention to the social, economic, and educational 
conditions of the various countries. He had letters of intro- 
duction to Wordsworth, Lockhart, De Quincey, Carlyle, 
and other distinguished literary writers. Barnard spent — 
much time in Europe studying school conditions, par- 
ticularly the work of Pestalozzi’s disciples in Germany and 
Switzerland. He returned from Europe with his mind 
enriched by valuable observation of social and educational 
conditions. He appreciated more than ever the institu- 
tions of his own country, and was convinced that hopes 
of permanent prosperity depended upon universal edu- 
cation. é 
Barnard was secretary of the State Board of Education 
of Connecticut from 1839 to 1842. During his term of 
office he brought about educational reforms similar to those 
which Horace Mann was carrying on in Massachusetts. 
From 1845 to 1849 he was State Commissioner of Public 
Schools in Rhode Island. In 1854 Barnard represented the 
United States at the Educational Congress held in London, 
and saw exhibited for the first time Froebel’s system of 
kindergarten, of which he wrote the first American account. 
In 1855 he began the publication of the American Jour- 
nal of Education, and completed it in 1893. An eminent 
college president, writing in the North American Review, 
January, 1876, said: “It is the best and only general 
authority in respect to the progress of American education 
during the past century. The comprehensiveness of this

work and its persistent publication under many adverse 
circumstances entitled the editor to the grateful recogni- 
tion of all investigators of our system of instruction.” 
_ The Journal of Education was more than a school review; 
it has aptly been called “a vast encyclopaedia of litera- 
ture.” In the domain of historical pedagogy it gives an 
account of the development of human culture, both theo- 
retical and practical, under the varying conditions of race, 
climate, religion, and government. It describes systems 
of education in the old world and the new normal schools, 
colleges, technical schools, elementary and secondary 
schools, and schools for the defectives. 
In 1867 Barnard became the first United States Com- 
missioner of Education. His extended acquaintance with 
educational systems in Europe and America and his large 
educational library enabled him to enter upon his duties 
with a wonderful background and experience. As Com- 
missioner of Education he outlined the policy which the 
Bureau has since followed in the collecting of educational 
statistics, and in attempts at the unification of the educa- 
tional forces of the country. “The crowning work of Dr. 
Barnard’s long and active life is that monumental encyclo- 
paedia of pedagogical literature, the American Journal of 
Education, thirty-two volumes of over eight hundred pages 
each.” 
Francis Parker. Francis Parker (1837-1902) was a 
leader in the field of educational method. Perhaps no 
other American educator in modern times has done more 
to modify and enrich the course of study in elementary 
schools. He was a lover of childhood and had the insight 
to see educational problems from the standpoint of the 
child. In 1872 Parker went to Germany and entered King 
William’s University at Berlin for a two-year course in 
‘Monroe, W. S., The Educational Labors of Henry Barnard.

philosophy, history, and pedagogies. Upon his return to 
this country he was elected Superintendent of Publie 
Schools at Quincy, Massachusetts. Said his committee in 
their report after he left them: 
For five years the town had the benefit of his faithful, intelli- 
gent, and enthusiastic services. In these years he transformed 
our public schools. He found them machines, he left them living 
organisms; drill gave way to growth, and the weary prison be- 
came a pleasure house. His dominant intelligence as a master, 
and his pervasive magnetism as a man, informed his school work. 
He breathed life, growth, and happiness into our schoolrooms. 
The results are plain to be seen before the eyes of everyone, solid, 
substantial, unmistakable. They cannot be gainsaid, or success- 
fully questioned. 
His most constructive work was done while he was in 
Chicago Institute, which afterwards became the School of 
Education of the University of Chicago. Here, with John 
Dewey, he conducted an experimental school. Students 
from all over the United States came to Chicago to study 
with Parker. The enthusiastic and scientific teachers that 
he trained have done much to bring about the educational 
reformation of our own day. 
William T. Harris. William T. Harris (1835-1918) has 
been justly called America’s first great educational philos- 
opher. He was a student of psychology, history, and 
philosophy of education. In his executive and administra- 
tive work as Superintendent of Schools at St. Louis and 
Commissioner of Education in Washington, he demon- 
strated his ability to realize educational ideals born of 
critical observation and reflection. While Superintendent 
of Schools of St. Louis he established (1873) the first 
public kindergarten in the United States. In the year 
1871 he published a well-organized plan for the orderly 
study of the sciences and one thoroughly characteristic of

252 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
his logical, philosophical mind. This type of course of 
study was widely copied, became very popular in the 
schools, and did much to introduce science instruction into 
the schools. 
John Dewey. The foremost American interpreter of 
the vast educational, social, and industrial changes which 
have marked the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, is 
John Dewey (1859- ), professor of philosophy, Colum-_ 
bia University. Better than anyone else he has thought 
out and stated a new educational philosophy—a philos- 
ophy suited to the needs and problems of the changed 
and changing conditions of human living. 
Education, in Dewey’s conception, involves not merely learning, 
but play, construction, use of tools, contact with nature, expres- 
sion, and activity; and the school should be a place where children 
are working rather than listening, learning life by living life, and 
becoming acquainted with social institutions and industrial proc- 
esses by studying them. The work of the school is in large part 
to reduce the complexity of modern life to such terms as children 
an understand, and to introduce the child to modern life through 
simplified experiences. Its primary business may be said to be 
to train children in codperative and mutually helpful living. The 
virtues of a school, as Dewey points out, are learning by doing; 
the use of muscles, sight and feeling, as well as hearing; and the 
employment of energy, originality, and initiative. The virtues 
of the school in the past were the colorless, negative virtues of ° 
obedience, docility, and submission. Mere obedience and the care- 
ful performance of imposed tasks he holds to be not only a poor 
preparation for social and industrial efficiency, but a poor 
preparation for democratic society and government as well. 
Responsibility for good government, under any democratic form 
of organization, rests with all, and the school should prepare for 
the political life of tomorrow by training its pupils to meet 
responsibilities, developing initiative, awakening social insight, 
and causing each to shoulder a fair share of the work of govern- 
ment in the school.t

  THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN EDUCATION 253 
‘WoMEN IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 
The part which women have played in the development 
of American education has been the main influence in the 
change toward the broadening of woman’s sphere. 
The value of her work to beget and to train future generations 
is understood as never before. In order to meet the high demands 
on her a wise and broad education is necessary. . . . With 
the conception that men and women have equal rights and equal 
abilities a new impulse was given education. That this ideal has 
become an essential feature of all modern education is due chiefly 
to the energy of the distinguished women of the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries.t 
Emma Willard. The life ambition of Emma Willard 
(1787-1870) was to organize a system of education for 
women which should possess the same permanency, uni- 
formity, and respectability as educational institutions for 
men, and yet differ so as to be adapted to the needs and 
interests of women. In 1800 women could not enter any 
eollege in the United States. In 1821 Emma Willard es- 
tablished Troy Female Seminary at Troy, New York.? 
This marked the beginning of higher education for women. 
This seminary was from the beginning popular and pros- 
perous. The leading families of the country sent their 
daughters there to be educated. One of the main pur- 
poses of this school was to educate the teachers in Mrs. 
Willard’s own methods. Many young women who gradu- 
ated from this school went into the western and southern 
states and did pioneer work in establishing educational 
institutions for women. 
In 1831 Emma Willard played an important part in 
establishing a girl’s school in Athens, Greece. In this 
enterprise she was joined by her sister, Mrs. Lincoln 
iHmerson, Mabel I, The Evolution of the American Ideal, page 108. *The Troy Female Seminary afterwards became the Emma Willard School, 
and today enjoys a splendid patronage.

254 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
Phelps, also a distinguished leader in the movement of edu- 
eation for women. Pupils came from all parts of Greece 
and were trained after the methods of Mrs. Willard. In 
1843 she became closely associated with Horace Mann and 
Henry Barnard in a great agitation for normal schools. 
She wrote several textbooks, which were translated into 
many languages, and collaborated with W. C. Woodridge 
in preparing Woodridge and Willard’s Geography. This 
book, together with her history texts, had an unusually 
wide use. In 1851 a medal and a certificate for her geog- 
raphy maps, were presented to her by Prince Albert at 
the World’s Fair held in London. 
Catherine Beecher. Catherine Beecher (1800-1878) 
was another of the pioneers in the movement for the 
higher education of women. In, 1828 she founded the 
Hartford Female Seminary, which for many years was 
one of the important institutions of its kind in America. 
For many years she traveled through the South and West 
lecturing upon educational subjects and developing an 
interest in higher education for women. Her works on 
domestic science were the first of their kind published in 
America. Among the most popular textbooks of the time 
were her arithmetics and geography. She contributed 
largely to the best educational literature of her day. 
Miss Beecher was instrumental in organizing the Ameri- 
ean Woman’s Educational Association. The purpose of 
this association was “to aid in securing to American women 
a liberal education, an honorable position in their appro- 
priate professions by means of endowed institutions on 
the college plan of organization; also to train women to 
be intelligent, successful wives, mothers, and house- 
keepers.”*

4 THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN EDUCATION 955 
Mary Lyon. Mary Lyon (1797-1849) was another pio- 
neer leader in the movement for the higher education 
of women. She was the founder and first president of 
Mount Holyoke College (1836). When it was unfashion- 
able for women to know more than how to read and write, 
Mary Lyon had the courage to ask that women have an 
education equal to men, a thing which was laughed at as 
impracticable and impossible. Her object was to estab- 
lish a school for young women which should be in every 
respect on a par with the best colleges for men. 
Mary Lyon did not create the demand for higher edu- 
cation of women, nor was she the first to voice it. How- 
ever, the establishing of Mount Holyoke marked the initial 
appearance of higher education for women in America. 
Vassar, Smith, and Wellesley, which came later, owe much 
to Mount Holyoke. They are indebted to the work which 
Mary Lyon accomplished in educating so many self- 
sacrificing teachers, and in giving concrete expression to 
the truth that intelligence is as valuable in a woman’s 
mind as in a man’s, and is capable of the same high 
development.

CHAPTER XIV 
THE LABORATORY OF DEMOCRACY 
Tue GrowTH or Democracy 
Taken in its widest meaning as the development of the 
physical, mental, and moral welfare of all of the people, 
democracy may be called the goal of civilization. All 
sociologists emphasize the democratic trend of society 
from its beginning. This trend appears in every field of 
human endeavor—political, eeonomic, social, moral, and 
educational. 
Democracy in the political world. The development of 
democracy is most readily seen in the political world. 
Among primitive men rulership belonged largely to the 
physically strong. Early government was dictatorial. 
The oriental monarchies were despotic and autocratic. 
At the beginning of the nineteenth century political power 
in the leading nations of Europe was still in the hands of the 
few. Even in the United States large groups of men of full age 
were denied the right to vote. It took two successive waves of 
political agitation to remove the property tax and religious quali-* 
fications for the suffrage, and this was not done until the middle 
of the century. A great war was then necessary to secure the 
nominal franchise of the negroes. [And women have just recently 
been given sufirage.] It required three similar waves of reform 
to approach manhood suffrage in England, which was accom- 
plished by the Gladstone Liberals only a generation ago. Like 
struggles were necessary in France to gain a voice in the govern- 
ment, first for the bourgeoisie, and later for the common people.

258 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
And in all of these countries the attainment of the suffrage is 
only the first step to real democracy.* 
Real democracy cannot be complete until the voters of 
all classes are trained to be intelligent and independent in 
assuming their political responsibilities. 
Another way to see the growth of political democracy 
is to analyze the field and aim of government. Primi- 
tive government existed only for the protection of its 
subjects. When this function became fairly well estab- 
lished, that of protecting property was undertaken. As 
political control improved along these lines, regulations 
were made to develop the individual and to stimulate 
economic endeavor’ Government then gradually assumed 
authority over the dependent, the defective, the delin- 
quent classes, over education, and over many other phases 
of personal welfare. It likewise extended its economic 
sphere by attempting to regulate commerce and industry. 
The postal service was taken over, banking and trans- 
portation were also regulated, and today there is scarcely 
a phase of our modern business life where indirect gov- 
ernmental regulation or direct government control is 
not evident. Democracy means not only the rule by 
many, but the rule over many things, and along both 
these lines we may count on continued progress. 
Economic democracy. Economic evolution shows just 
as striking a democratic advance as political evolution. 
When the first savage fashioned the first crude weapon 
or tool, the first bit of capital was created. It was a 
monopoly. From that day to the present the store of 
the world’s wealth has been increasing. The day of want 
is pushed farther in advance. “While the savage con-

tinually faced starvation it has been calculated that the 
reserve store of the world’s goods is now large enough, 
if it could be capitalized into the sort of commodities 
needed, to run the world more than five years.” While 
it is still very unevenly distributed, every individual is 
nevertheless able to live better by virtue of its existence, 
The day laborer of today is able to live better and to get 
a greater amount and variety of both the necessities and 
luxuries than the medieval lord in days of old. The 
trend toward economic democracy appears in every phase 
of our modern industrial world. Democratic progress 
is clearly shown in the changing of the basis of taxation, 
through property, income, and inheritance taxes, so that 
ability to pay will be the test and wealth will bear a 
greater proportion of the increasing burden of state 
enterprises. 
Social democracy. The growth of social democracy is 
evident on every hand. Medieval and early modern 
European society consisted of a regular hierarchy, with 
almost impassable barriers separating class from class. 
So closely were the privileges of birth held that it took 
centuries of struggle to break their defenses and destroy 
their power. In England the dominance of the royal 
family was first overthrown, and then the supremacy 
of the privileged lords was undermined. Titles still 
exist, but they are comparatively empty honors, carry- 
ing but little power and few privileges. 
As Smith says: 
This revolt against birth is especially conspicuous in new coun- 
tries and within frontier society, Nevertheless, it had to be 
fought out in the United States as elsewhere. John Adams 
wrote a book in which he urged that the government should re-

main in the hands of the rich, the able, and the well born. 
‘ Andrew Jackson rode into the Presidency on a popular 
democratic upheaval that was as much a revolt against the rule 
of birth and aristocratic culture as it was political. 
A stratified society is natural and will continue to exist, 
but there is an unchangeable tendency to substitute real 
worth and achievement for artificial selection in deter- 
mining class standing. Social democracy is following 
close on the heels of political and economic democracy. 
Various other struggles toward democracy might be 
traced along cultural, religious, legal, and institutional 
lines. In every phase of life, exclusiveness, privilege, and 
artificial distinctions are rapidly disappearing. 
Tue ScHoor—TuHeE Laporatory or DEMocRACY 
The relation between education and democracy. The 
relation of education to this democratic trend is direct 
and fundamental. Education and democracy are bound 
up in an unending chain of cause and effect. More 
democracy means more general education, and more gen- 
eral education means more universal democracy. A real 
democracy cannot exist without universal education, and 
universal education cannot be obtained except in a democ- 
racy. Democratic education must be of the people, by 
the people, and for the people. 
The American public school, the laboratory of democ- 
racy, is a social institution established and controlled 
by society for the purpose of maintaining its own stability 
and determining the direction of its own progress, 
These aims can be realized only by making education an 
agency both for preserving the achievements of the 
past and for promoting social progress and reform, When 
other social institutions fail to provide desirable forms

    THE LABORATORY OF DEMOCRACY 261 
of training for the social demand, such training must 
be taken over by the school. Within recent years impor- 
tant changes have taken place in the home, in the state, 
in the church, and in the vocations which have imposed 
on the school many functions once exercised by one or 
more of these institutions. 
The home and the school. Within the past three or 
four generations the development of the home as an 
informal institution of education has been marked by 
important changes which have tended to lessen the influ- 
ence of the home as an educational agency. The majority 
of these changes center around the lessening of the home 
or family solidarity. This is manifest in the lessened 
amount of responsibility for the children on the part of 
the parents; in the withdrawal of the father and some- 
times the mother from home occupations to occupations 
in factories and stores. Obviously, the burden thrown 
on the school by the decreased influence of the home in 
these respects affects all divisions of education. It is in 
part the basis of the present demand for increased atten- 
tion to the moral and social education of boys and girls, 
a demand which cannot be neglected in the laboratory of 
democracy without distinct loss to our efficiency as a 
nation. Not only is it true that changes in the home 
itself have imposed responsibilities on the school, but it 
is also true that the relation between the two institutions 
has changed to such an extent that the school must 
assume certain responsibilities before appropriate to the 
home. 
Industry and the school. Important changes in the 
vocations and in industry have likewise added further re- 
sponsibilities to the school. The disappearance of the 
apprentice system, the development of the modern factory

262 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
system—these and many other factors have greatly dimin- 
ished the amount of vocational education and training 
formerly provided by the vocation itself. As is the case 
with the changes in the home, these changes in the vocations 
have imposed responsibilities on the school, and the two 
institutions have altered to such an extent that the 
school must assume certain responsibilities and duties 
before appropriate to the vocation. The changes in the 
vocation and industry show clearly the urgent need for 
recognizing the importance of vocational education, 
guidance, and direction in the public schools. 
The needs of society determine the aims of education. 
To state that the American public schools, the laboratory 
of democracy, should conform to the democratic ideals 
and the democratic organization of American society is 
to state a platitude. The implications of such a state- 
ment, however, are not always clearly perceived. Effi- 
cient membership in American society, according to 
Inglis, demands at least three qualifications: 
(1) An ability effectively to execute the formal and informal 
duties of citizenship and carry the burden of political responsi- 
bility; (2) an ability to produce and labor sufficiently to carry 
one’s own economic load; (3) an ability to utilize one’s leisure 
time and act in an individual capacity without interfering with 
the interest of others.1 
In our American democracy these three forms of activity 
must be considered as important for every citizen in so 
far as his individual capacity and circumstances permit. 
Not only should educational opportunity be universal in 
America, but these three phases of activity must be nec- 
essary parts of the education due every normal individual. 
Fundamental aims of the public schools. Thus we see

  THE LABORATORY OF DEMOCRACY 263 
that the American public school systems, the laboratory 
of democracy, have three fundamental aims or purposes: 
First, the preparation of the individual as a prospective 
citizen and codperating member of society; second, the 
preparation of the individual as a prospective worker 
and producer ; third, the preparation of the individual for 
the proper use of his leisure time and the development 
of his personality. Every individual is at the same time 
a citizen, a worker, and a relatively independent, per- 
sonality. These three phases cannot be divorced, and in 
the laboratory of democracy preparation for no one of 
these phases of life should be neglected. 
Thus the first mentioned aim of education involves the 
preparation of individuals for efficient participation in 
desirable forms of social codperation. Hence, the labora- 
tory of democracy must develop knowledge, habits, abil- 
ities, and ideals which will enable the individual to play 
his part as a social unit in group activities. This involves 
the development of ideals and habits of codperation; the 
development of a knowledge of the important social 
institutions and their place in the social order; the devel- 
opment of a knowledge of the civic activities involved in 
community life; the development of a keen sense of social 
responsibility. 
A second major aim of education involves the prepara- 
tion of the individual for efficient participation in those 
activities of society involving economic efficiency. Society 
makes its demand on every individual to engage in eco- 
nomic activity, at least to the extent of pulling his own 
load. This makes it necessary that the laboratory of 
democracy develop knowledge, skill, and habits involved 
in prevocational and vocational activities; that it develop 
the ideals, standards, and conditions of the economic 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
264 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
world; that it see to the discovery and development of 
special interests and abilities of different individuals for 
vocational pursuits, and to the development of an under- 
standing of the significance of various occupations to 
society. 
A third major aim of education involves the prepara- 
tion of the individual for the worthy use of leisure and 
the development of his personality. Preparation for 
the leisure part of life is just as essential as the prepara- 
tion for the toiling part of life. Within recent years 
there has been a constant tendency toward increased 
amount of leisure time, and this has introduced problems 
of vital importance for the laboratory of democracy. 
There must be developed a sense of social responsibility ; a 
respect for the rights and interests of others; and tastes 
and standards for the enjoyment and use of leisure. 
The changing needs of society. It is an obvious fact 
that as time passes society changes, and the demands of 
the social organization are more or less modified. There- 
fore, the aims of education must constantly be revamped 
and adapted to meet these changing needs of society 
and to enable the individual to grow and to widen his 
intellectual horizon. At the present time in America the 
rate of change in all phases of our social organization is 
rapid, and is likely to be rapid for some time to come, 
The present conditions will in all probability change in 
important ways within the life of the generation which 
is at present being prepared in the laboratory of democ- 
racy for adult membership in society. 
The activities of our present society call for knowledge 
and skill that could not have been foreseen by those re- 
sponsible for education twenty years ago. In the field 
of civie and political affairs are such factors as woman
-P-A-G-E-293
  
THE LABORATORY OF DEMOCRACY 265 
suffrage, the initiative and referendum, commission gov- 
ernment, the short ballot, direct primaries, codperative 
marketing, the league of nations, and a host of other civie, 
social, and political problems. Specific preparation for 
these activities could not have been offered in our schools 
for those who are now called upon to meet them. In the 
field of industry new activities have developed within 
recent years which the school could not have provided 
for. New opportunities for the individual’s enjoyment 
of leisure time have opened up within recent years, for 
which the school of a few years ago could not have estab- 
lished standards of conduct except in the most general 
way. 
‘We may be just as sure that equally important changes 
will face the pupils now in our laboratory of democracy, 
which we cannot foresee and for which, therefore, we 
cannot provide specific preparation. The rapid change 
in certain phases of social activities means that mere 
adjustment of the pupils in our laboratory of democracy 
to existing conditions in society is inadequate; that to 
this there must be added the development of the capacity 
to readjust to the changing conditions which we may 
be sure will face the pupils after leaving the schoolroom. 
The new conditions we cannot clearly foresee, but’ we 
know they will in some respects differ from existing con- 
ditions. The real mark of intelligent behavior is this 
ability to respond to changing conditions in our environ- 
ment. . 
Two important social forces which the school must 
recognize. The continuity and progress of society depend 
upon a proper balance between two sets of forces which 
determine the social organization. One set of forces 
binds the various parts of society together and unifies it—
-P-A-G-E-294
  266 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
the integrating force. The other set tends to separate 
the various parts of society and disrupt it—the differenti- 
ating force. In any society there is need of a certain 
amount of like-mindedness, unity of thought, feelings, 
ideals, and standards of conduct. Such unity is more 
necessary in a democracy such as ours than in any other 
society. But it is also true that individual differences 
and differentiated needs of society demand recognition. 
The laboratory of democracy must make provision for the 
development of that amount of like-mindedness and unity 
in thought, habits, and ideals, which is necessary for 
social solidarity; likewise, it must make provision for 
individual differences. Individuals differ in native capac- 
ities, acquired tendencies, aptitudes, and interests. Fail- 
ure to recognize this fundamental fact at any time must 
inevitably mean failure to do justice to the individual 
and to society. 
Privileges and responsibilities of individual members of 
society. It must further be recognized that in our Amer- 
ican democracy each individual must be not merely a 
law-abiding citizen, but also to some extent a law-making 
citizen. Furthermore, the minimum level of general 
intelligence necessary in any society must depend on 
the amount of privilege and responsibility resting on the 
individual:, It must also be recognized that with the 
growing complexity of our modern social and economic 
life the amount of intelligence and training necessary 
to meet its privileges and responsibilities is much greater 
than at any former time. A larger proportion of the 
prospective members of American society should receive 
the benefits of education beyond the elementary school. 
The increased privileges and responsibilities granted to
-P-A-G-E-295
    THE LABORATORY OF DEMOCRACY 267 
and demanded of the individual in American society 
cannot be provided for by a system which gives a ma- 
jority of the citizens merely an elementary education. 
Education and social progress. It has usually been 
assumed that the American people are devoted to educa- 
tion as an ideal. Our social and economic ignorance, 
high percentage of illiteracy, and poorly paid teachers 
indicate the contrary. We need to realize that educa- 
tion is the only rational means of-social_progress. We 
need to see the vital relation between democracy and 
education, that both must rise or sink together. Our 
schools have resting upon them the burden of shaping 
democracy and molding the course of government. The 
mass of mankind, in spite of the efforts of the schools, 
is-at least_a generation behind in its conceptions of gov- © 
ernment and in its social thinking; and it probably will 
ever_be so. 
Our colleges, for example, are usually teaching ideas 
a generation ahead of current practices. The really 
thinking people in any nation are in an almost hopeless 
minority. Government in a democracy is the government 
of the average mass, and the task of the school is to 
help leaven the mass and make government more intelli- 
gent in the next generation than in the present. The 
problems of democracy are the opportunities of the 
public school, and the school will be called upon to ren- 
der larger and more important service as democracy 
spreads and its problems increase in complexity. Upon 
the public school teachers of America rests the estab- 
lishment among the people of the ideals and attitudes 
which are to shape the course of our American democ- 
racy during the years that are to come. 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  268 AN INTRODUCTION TO EDUCATION 
Education will not automatically promote the ends 
of democracy. It is worth while to remind ourselves that, 
as Bode says: 
There is no inherent magic in education by which it auto- 
matically promotes the ends of democracy. Education is a tool 
that can be made, and has been made, to serve many masters. It 
ean deepen lines of cleavage and can consolidate one class as 
against other classes or one interest as against other interests. 
Education was never more widespread or more effectively con- 
ducted than in recent times, yet it did not prevent the World 
War; it made this war more terrible than any that preceded it. 
There is no good reason to think that more education will, in 
itself, safeguard democracy or safeguard us from other cata- 
strophie wars. To bring about this result we must have a different 
quality of education, which means education conducted in a dif- 
ferent spirit and with different standards of value. . . . What 
counts, in short, is not only the materials that are taught, but 
the spirit in which they are taught, the spirit that is made to 
pervade our educational system. A system is not democratic 
simply because it is made available to everybody or because it 
is administered without distinction of persons. In a Spartan 
scheme of education all are included and all are treated equally, 
but it is not democratic because the individual is subordinated, is 
made a means to an end; and that end, the State. To be truly 
democratic, education must treat the individual himself as the 
end and set itself the task of preparing him for that inteliectual 
and emotional sharing in the life and affairs of men which em- 
bodies the spirit of the Golden Rule.t 
Questions and Problems 
1. In what sense is democracy an attitude of mind and not 
a mere form of government? 
2. Make a list of three or four civie and political duties 
and responsibilities which are required at the present time but 
were not required twenty-five years ago. 
3. Make a list of five civic and political duties and respon- 
sibilities which are not required now, but eters) will be 
required twenty-five years from now.

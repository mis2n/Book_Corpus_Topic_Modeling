PREFACE 
The gratifying reception accorded by the public to the “Songs of the Child World” No. 1, 
and the many assurances which we have received from every quarter of their unique adapta- 
tion to the needs of both teacher and child, have led us to offer to the public this second 
volume, 
Our experience and-observation lead us to believe that songs dealing with the various 
_ phases of nature are not only most attractive to the child but also most stimulating to its imag- 
ination and we have therefore endeavored to make the nature side of the present work very 
broad in its scope. 
The fact remains, however, that a large proportion of Kindergarten pupils are city children to 
whom a wide acquaintance with nature is impossible; and as the child’s education must unfold 
thru its environment, we have endeavored to supply songs which deal with the interrelation- 
ships of civilized society both in the home and the outside world. It must, however, be con- 
sidered that there are many experiences in the life of a great city which are so involved or so 
forced away from the conditions of nature as to make their simple expression in any art form 
almost impossible. 
We have given much attention to motion songs, realizing that action, properly directed in 
play, is the basis of education. 
We have eamestly endeavored to make these songs true not ‘only to the lines and color of 
each picture presented, but also to its underlying and characteristic rhythm, hoping thus to lead 
the child to a comprehension of the unity of nature. :

  PREFACE 
This text on the teaching of science is intended for 
use in teacher-training institutions, and by science 
teachers already in service who feel the need of 
suggestions for the betterment of their work. The 
book is an outgrowth of the experiences of the au- 
thors—one as head of a science department (Chem- 
istry) in a large city school system, and the other 
for many years engaged in fitting students to teach 
high school sciences. 
Throughout the book the “human element” has 
purposely been kept prominent. The teacher, and 
the pupils being taught, constitute the dominant 
factors in all discussions. It is conceived by the 
authors that in a very real sense the success of any 
science teacher even as of other teachers can properly 
be gauged by what his pupils learn. His instruc- 
tional efforts primarily are not to make scientists of 
his pupils, but rather men and women intellectually 
responsive in ways that are characteristically scien- 
tific. 
It is primarily the desire of the authors to be 
of service to beginners in science teaching, and to 
all who are making a study of science’ teaching.

PREFACE 
They believe that any selections and adaptations of 
subject matter, and all methods of presentation for 
teaching purposes, are distinctively means rather 
than ends in an educational process. Chief among 
these ends in the minds of science teachers should 
be that kind of thought stimulation and that kind 
of development of power to think constructively 
whose natural results are not only trained intellects 
but also an abiding “desire for the truth” in all 
matters. 
In all discussions throughout the text a unity for 
all science teaching, in large and in small high 
schools alike, is found in the common aims of science 
teaching rather than in any likeness of equipment, 
of teacher qualifications, or of the numbers of pupils 
handled. A clear understanding of the purposes and 
principles of science teaching necessarily contributes 
to unity of effort among science teachers from na- 
ture study courses onward, and tends to supplant 
a diversity in teaching so notably in evidence in 
science instruction. 
The authors desire to acknowledge especial obli- 
gation to Mrs. Louise Brownell Trow for her assist- 
ance in the preparation of a section dealing with the 
biological sciences for which her training especially 
fits her; and to Dr. F. E. Henzlik of Teachers Col- 
lege, University of Nebraska, and Dr. William Clark 
Trow of the College of Education, University of 
Cincinnati, for their reading of the manuscript.

CHAPTER I 
PLACE OF LABORATORY WORK IN THE TEACHING 
OF SCIENCE 
Through wisely chosen laboratory exercises, and effi- 
cient laboratory administration, science teaching ac- 
complishes its notable part in school instruction. With- 
out its experimental aspects science teaching when 
attempted is largely shorn of its distinctive features 
and educational possibilities. How much there shall 
be of this experimental work in any science course, and 
what shall be the requirements for supplies and ap- 
paratus, are variables in the teaching scheme. But 
whether or not the instruction is on a laboratory basis 
constitutes a determining factor in evaluating “science 
courses.”/ Through laboratory exercises there can be 
developed, stimulated and directed a desire to learn 
on the part of pupils. These exercises should beget a 
teachableness in pupils fundamental in the learning 
process, and should provide a way for rapid acquisition 
of knowledge. Discussions of the place and importance 
of laboratory work then naturally demand attention. 
Laboratory work in all science teaching may very 
properly be considered as a first hand study of phe- 
nomena. This contrasts sharply with studies of state- 
3
-P-A-G-E-16
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER: 
ments concerning phenomena as these are set forth in 
books. In high school science both these phases of 
the teaching process must be insisted upon as indis- 
pensable. Science studies without laboratory exercises 
are scarcely worthy of their name. And this is as true of 
introductory courses such as general science as it is of 
chemistry and other more advanced high school sci- 
ence branches. The character of exercises suitable for 
pupils in the various sciences must of necessity be 
varied both by reason of the immediate ends to be se- 
cured, and because of differences in the maturity and 
preparation of pupils. The classroom instruction in 
all cases, however, should center around laboratory 
work. This laboratory work should never become in 
the estimation of classes merely an adjunct to class- 
room instruction, Naturally this view of it is held by 
pupils when it is scheduled for certain days only in 
rooms dedicated solely to this kind of work, and when 
perchance its topics are unrelated to those under dis- 
cussion at the time in the classroom. 
Laboratory exercises are not only a means for first 
hand information concerning facts which are funda- 
mental in the discussion of topics, but in addition they 
should be thought-provoking. The facts in themselves 
are not enough. There must be apparent to pupils 
certain relationships between these facts as they note 
the results of the experiments being performed. There 
must be such a continuity in these relationships as 
shall constitute a well-defined thought process, natural 
4
-P-A-G-E-17
  PLACE OF LABORATORY WORK 
and progressive even when elementary. Wisely-chosen 
and well-managed laboratory exercises furnish these 
possibilities in thought processes. This involves not 
only numbers of facts called to the attention of pupils, 
but their usableness both in interpreting knowledge 
previously gained through experience, and in unifying 
what is known with newly acquired information. (See 
Part II—Nature Study, and Appendix D.) 
Facts learned through wisely chosen laboratory exer- 
cises have with beginners in science a worth in mental 
processes not possible for information gained from the 
formal statements of text and reference books./ These 
facts exceed in worth the teachings of experience to 
the extent that they are better comprehended and re- 
lated, and they are more likely to be remembered. 
When enough of these laboratory exercises have been 
performed, pupils are mentally equipped for the more 
rapid interpretation and assimilation of facts as 
summed up in books wherein the experiences of others 
are set forth. The attention of pupils having been 
centered upon a topic, and their interest aroused by 
laboratory contact with certain of its phases, it may 
be confidently expected that to some degree at least 
there has been developed a desire for further knowl- 
edge concerning the topic. In the teaching process this 
becomes the time of all times to turn to text and refer- 
ence books for further information which has been 
gained through the experience of others. Facts too 
numerous or too difficult of acquisition for the beginner 
5
-P-A-G-E-18
er 
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
to attempt to collect for himself are thus supplied. 
Practical applications and natural relationships to pre- 
viously acquired knowledge, together with any his- 
torical setting, may now come under consideration. 
The question of just when and where in laboratory 
and classroom a transition shall occur from the realm 
of investigation to the study of what others have 
learned constitutes an ever recurring “teaching prob- 
lem.”’ Its correct solution involves experience, apti- 
tude in teaching, and not least of all an understanding 
of conditions and motives for mental activity. To meet 
this need for an intimate definite knowledge of the 
mental states of individual pupils, no opportunities 
for learning excel those offered in the laboratory. 
There, free from restraints of the class period, the 
work is.more largely individual teaching. It is rendered 
as individual need arises. In the laboratory the dom- 
inating power of one person over another, summed up 
in a teacher’s “personality,” yields its largest teaching 
values. 
Experiments of whatever grade of difficulty are the 
best of means both in the laboratory and in the class- 
room of “arresting attention,” “stimulating interest,” 
and “arousing a desire to know.” The phenomenal 
element in them, however simple it may be, is a chal- 
lenge to any normal mind to “see what happens.” No 
better means in the hands of teachers is available for 
arousing and for renewing interest in discussions than 
6
-P-A-G-E-19
  
  PLACE OF LABORATORY WORK 
is offered through experimental exercises simple in 
manipulation and easy to comprehend. 
Each laboratory exercise may be characterized, too, 
as a problem the solution of which is made possible for 
the pupil, provided he makes use oth of the appli- 
ances at hand and of what he knows. This is regard- 
less of whether the knowledge he possesses was learned 
in or out of school. Something is required done by the 
pupil, and the doing must conform to certain condi- 
tions stated or implied. These conditions must always 
be under control. There must be a well-defined pur- 
pose, too, in what is done, and to the pupil it must be 
something quite worthwhile. The results attained as 
facts, and the conclusions based upon these facts, con- 
stitute a solution of the problem. In and through all) 
these solutions full use should be made of what the 
pupil already knows as gained by experience. It is 
the vivifying element in the instruction given, and 
maintains the unity of life in and out of the school- 
room. (See “Teaching-Projects,” p. 68.) 
During the first weeks of a science subject it may 
be well in many high schools to have the instructor 
do much of the experimental work, possibly all of it. 
In this way pupils in a class have opportunity to get 
into the spirit of the new subject before being over- 
whelmed with requirements unfamiliar to them. Ob- 
servation by the pupils of this experimental work done 
by the teacher, including the results obtained by him 
; 7
-P-A-G-E-20
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
and the interpretations placed upon these results 
through class discussions of them, creates a confidence 
on the part of pupils concerning what they themselves 
may be able to do and to learn through their own lab- 
oratory studies. 
This in some measure seeks to regain and retain the 
wonderfully effective demonstration work of the old- 
time lectures in Natural Philosophy. It is to be kept 
in mind, however, that whatever adaptations are made 
in high school science courses, there must ever be re- 
tained a large measure of the instructional effort in- 
volved in using the question-and-answer method. 
While a greater rate of progress is commonly made 
where the experimental work is done by the teacher, 
there must needs be maintained throughout it all the 
fullest measure of individual pupil participation both 
of observation and of inference. Especially is this 
true at the outset of the course. Freedom of pupils 
from manipulation of strange apparatus should con- 
tribute to such participation. Where pupils in the 
science courses are set at laboratory work from the 
first in these beginning exercises, there should be no 
serious difficulties of manipulation. The exercises 
should deal with simple and fundamental subjects such 
as are likely to prove of interest to the pupil, and as 
a rule should require only familiar material and ap- 
paratus. 
In small high schools there is less need to observe 
hard and fast divisions of time into class and lab- 
8
-P-A-G-E-21

PLACE OF LABORATORY WORK | 
oratory periods. In the larger high schools the size 
of classes, and the number of sections in a science sub- 
ject, may necessitate these arrangements for admin- 
istrative purposes. Quite an ideal condition exists 
when a double period daily is at the disposal of a sci- 
ence teacher. All preparation of lessons from experi- 
ments or from books, all discussions of text material 
and of lists of questions, and all solutions of problems 
and of quantitative experiments, may then be ac- 
complished within this time. Changes may be made 
at any time from one kind of work to another as the 
nature of the work and progress of the class demands. 
All preparation then becomes supervised study, and 
no outside lesson preparation in the subject is required. 
Actual experience with these ideal conditions shows 
that the additional cost in time of teacher per pupil is 
in no small part compensated for by the much smaller 
per cent of failures of pupils. There is time under this 
system, too, for trips during school hours to nearby 
factories and shops, to industrial and municipal plants 
without interference with other school work. What is 
learned on these trips is likely to be remembered long 
after much of the textbook material is lost. 
Changes may be made at a moment’s notice at any 
time during these double periods from class thinking 
to individual efforts, from instruction of a personal 
type to general discussions. Elimination of much waste 
of time in preparing lessons, and the formation of right 
habits of study, become possibilities. The laboratory 
9   
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
becomes in truth a workshop where “scientific atti- 
tudes” and “scientific methods” are in evidence. It is 
to be said in this connection, however, that heavy de- 
mands are made upon teachers by any such arrange- 
ment. It requires a large expenditure of energy, and 
noteworthy executive and administrative ability. But 
the live and growing teacher exults in such op- 
portunities. 
In large or crowded schools even where the double 
period is enjoyed it may be necessary for classes to 
alternate between laboratory and classroom, being in 
the laboratory only every other day. In these cases 
much can be done to make the sequence of events a 
natural rather than an artificial one. By careful plan- 
ning every minute of the laboratory time may be made 
available for experimental purposes. A few closely 
related experiments can be done in one day, and the 
class discussion of them and their “write-up” can come 
the following day in the classroom. The use of any ref- 
erence books, all presentations of new topics, etc., can 
be reserved for the double period in the classroom. 
Thus the undoubted limitations due to an inability to 
have access to the laboratory or the lecture room at 
will are at least minimized.

CHAPTER II 
CHARACTER OF THE LABORATORY EXERCISES, 
AND THE LABORATORY MANUAL 
What the nature of the exercises required in sec- 
ondary school science shall be depends necessarily upon 
what purpose the laboratory work has in the teaching 
scheme. With different sciences taught and with varied 
teaching conditions in different schools, to say nothing 
of teachers and pupils and texts and manuals as vari- 
able factors, any unity of instruction in high school 
sciences must lie in their aim rather than in the de- 
tails of any method. Fortunately there are certain gen- 
eral conditions applicable alike to laboratory work in 
all the sciences. Waste and inefficiency go hand in 
hand with laboratory work which on the part of an 
instructor lacks well-defined purposes and plans. De- 
pendence upon the order of topics given in a text, and 
upon directions for laboratory exercises as given in a 
\manual is not sufficient. | A clear appreciation of the 
/ purposes of the laboratory, and of its exercises in any 
( teaching scheme as a whole, must be had by the sci- 
| ence teacher as preparation for his work, 
For simplicity of discussion, laboratory exercises of 
all secondary school sciences may roughly be grouped 
12
-P-A-G-E-25
  CHARACTER OF THE LABORATORY EXERCISES 
either as qualitative or quantitative in character. The 
nature of this classification is apparent in the names. 
Account cannot be taken here of the special difficulties 
incident on the one hand in handling the numerous 
laboratory sections of large city high schools, and on 
the other in meeting the varied and often unrelated 
demands made upon science teachers in the smaller 
high schools. Executive ability of no mean order is 
required for laboratory administration in high school 
science teaching. A necessary adaptation of the means 
at hand to the ends sought intensifies its diversity in 
procedure. In nowise, however, does this make im- 
possible a unity in purpose such as set forth below. 
That science teachers may in large measure have failed , 
to agree upon any major aims, and may have over-em- 
phasized the importance of exercising the greatest of 
freedom in choice of purposes, is perhaps all the more 
reason for the presentation that follows. 
The primary aim of secondary school science is con- 
ceived as having a three-fold aspect set forth as fol- 
lows: /To promote the development of a scientific atti- 
tude in pupils;?to enable them to become skilled in 
the acquisition and organization of facts pertaining to 
any topic whether in school or out jfand to become com- 
petent to reach general conclusions legitimately based 
upon the facts under consideration.! The laboratory 
work upon any topic thus becomes a preliminary study 
of that topic. Pupils have brought before them 
through simple laboratory exercises certain facts con- 
13
-P-A-G-E-26
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
cerning a topic. To the fullest degree possible these 
facts should be thought-provoking, and should possess 
an inherent interest for the pupil. Some or all of the 
exercises may be worked out by the teacher, and class 
discussions and explanations may occupy portions of 
the time set apart as a laboratory period. But it is 
the pupil who must acquire and relate these facts up 
to the full limit of his ability to do so. Waste of time, 
and the discouragement which results from attempts by 
a pupil to accomplish what is not clearly understood 
either in nature or in process, is at no time permitted 
to continue under efficient laboratory administration. 
Sufficient comment made by an instructor upon the 
purpose of any set of laboratory exercises at the time 
of its assignment should make clear to pupils an under- 
standing of it as a worth while undertaking. ‘Brief 
mention should be made concerning any special pre- 
cautions to be taken, and any serious difficulties to be 
met. This goes far towards an elimination of misun- 
derstandings and of aimless effort with its accompany- 
ing waste of time and energy. The general purpose of 
the instructor is to assure an understanding by pupils 
of “what next, and why?” 
It is well, also, at this time to relate very briefly the 
new work to that which has immediately preceded it. 
For example, suppose that a chemistry class has just 
been working a series of experiments in which it has 
become very evident that air has an active gas called 
oxygen in it. The class is now about to prepare oxy- 
14
-P-A-G-E-27
  CHARACTER OF THE LABORATORY EXERCISES 
gen from potassium chlorate using manganese dioxide 
to hasten the reaction. The instructor reminds the 
class that it is time to get better acquainted with the 
gas which apparently was responsible for most of the 
chemical activity of air. It is inconvenient if not im- 
possible to extract this gas from the air in the ordinary 
laboratory, but it may be obtained easily in consid- 
erable quantity by heating a mixture of potassium 
chlorate and manganese dioxide. The specific direc- 
tions for performing the experiment should then be 
studied, and the laboratory work undertaken. This 
introductory discussion may take place at the latter 
part of the previous classroom hour, thus saving all 
of the laboratory time for laboratory work. 
One difficulty at a time for beginners in new and un- 
familiar studies means the use of exercises simple in 
the thought and manipulations required. In choosing 
apparatus the simplest forms which give satisfactory 
results are always to be preferred.1 From the “known 
to the unknown” necessitates the use in qualitative ex- 
ercises of what the pupil has already learned in pre- 
ceding laboratory work, and in the wide range of ex- 
periences outside school. These experiences repeat- 
edly invoked enable a ready understanding of new 
phenomena, and whatever is now for the first time to 
*TIn the electrolysis of water, for example, test-tubes placed over 
two simple forms of electrodes will -suffice in place of the expensive 
Hoffmann electrolysis apparatus. The attention of pupils is not then 
diverted to the apparatus employed, and away from the phenomena 
and the conditions these involve.

be learned under the fixed conditions of experimental 
work. They likewise explain and make significant what 
has before been unorganized knowledge. 
The “write-up” of experiments may come as each 
exercise is completed, or it may be delayed till the con- 
clusion of a series of related experiments, regardless of 
whether these are performed by the pupils themselves 
or by the instructor. In the latter case the teacher 
should insist upon oral statements of observations and 
inferences by pupils, with sufficient discussions of the 
experiments while the work proceeds to enable the 
pupils later to write worth while notes. These results 
should be written up for the purpose of recalling, select- 
ing, and properly relating the essential facts involved, 
and for a concise expression of the connected thought 
to which these facts have given rise. These papers 
handed in, credited, and corrected so far as the teacher’s 
time and strength permit, are then returned to the 
pupils to constitute their notebooks wholly or in large 
part. In any more or less painstaking review of these 
exercises in a succeeding class period there is oppor- 
tunity for the teacher to repeat occasionally some one 
of these exercises, or to do other related Teacher’s Ex- 
periments to enrich the instruction, to sustain interest 
and to provoke further thought. Illustrations may be 
multiplied as needed. No considerable degree of ac- 
curacy or large measure of skill in manipulation of ap- 
paratus, and no expensive outfits in apparatus and 
16
-P-A-G-E-29
  CHARACTER OF THE LABORATORY EXERCISES 
equipment, are necessarily involved in this “knowledge- 
making process.” 
During the times when the write-up of results of 
experiments is being carried out, and when the nature 
of the exercise permits it without endangering the in- 
tegrity of results, free use of texts and of various ref- 
erence books in the laboratory by the pupils still fur- 
ther should emphasize the fact that this time is a study 
period. This is the time when a need for facts and 
explanations from books is most apparent, and the 
time when information gained from books has its larg- 
est value, and when a precise use of an enlarged vocabu- 
lary of scientific terms is most natural. It is at these 
times, too, that pupils most readily learn to use books 
to the best advantage—one of the most important 
phases of study-training. Some of the sciences lend 
themselves to this procedure less satisfactorily than 
others, but with all the high school sciences various 
text and reference books may very properly be con- 
sidered part of the laboratory equipment. Their use 
during laboratory time under supervision is not only 
legitimate, but it is fruitful in achieving that major 
aim of all school work—formation of correct study 
habits. 
It is important to see to it that such science books 
as are owned by the school are kept in the science de- 
partment rooms—not in a remote general library. They 
should be right at hand for immediate reference when 
17, 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
needed. A departmental library is a fine thing where 
possible; but a wall shelf, or a shelf in an apparatus 
case in the classroom or laboratory, is sufficient. In 
a very real sense these books are part of the laboratory 
outfit. Sectional bookcases are handy for storing ref- 
erence books when not in use. It is a mistake to 
allow fear of loss of reference books to interfere with 
their free use by pupils. The widest possible use, too, 
of reference texts is to be encouraged rather than re- 
stricted. It is part of the instructional duty of a sci- 
ence teacher to be helpful in showing his pupils how 
to use the library facilities of the department and of 
the school in general. The use both of the index and 
of the table of contents of a book should be explained. 
Certain texts and reference books should at times be 
suggested to the class for special purposes. If a public 
library is accessible, it may be well to conduct classes 
through the reference section, getting the librarian to 
explain the use of the general catalogue, the scientific 
periodical index, etc., and to point out the actual loca- 
tion in the reference library room of books upon the 
various sciences. 
In physics and chemistry especially, and in all the 
sciences of the high school more or less, quantitative 
exercises such as problems, experiments, graphs, draw- 
ings to a scale, etc., may be made to play a double pur- 
pose. There is no substitute for the tests which these 
quantitative requirements make of accuracy in work of 
pupils, their skill in use of apparatus and appliances, 
18
-P-A-G-E-31
  CHARACTER OF THE LABORATORY EXERCISES 
their conciseness in expression of results. Review of 
results by the instructor is likewise readily accom- 
plished. 
Then, too, the use of quantitative exercises furnishes 
the teacher and laboratory director a solution of one 
of the most serious teaching problems connected with 
science instruction. A reserve stock of these quantita- 
tives should be kept at hand ready to give out at any 
time to the more rapid workers in a class. Besides the 
minimum of laboratory work required of all pupils, 
those more capable and ambitious should be given ad- 
ditional exercises of sufficient difficulty to tax their best 
efforts. Needless to say these exercises must be of 
such a nature that the doing of them appears worth 
while. The more of this extra work done the higher 
should be the standing of any pupil in the class. By 
such provisions the duller, slower pupils are not rushed 
beyond their capacity, and disheartened because they 
are ever being penalized for natural incapacity and 
inaptitude. With the principle involved once com- 
prehended by a class, and an ordinary amount of tact 
and administrative ability exercised in its introduction 
and use, many disciplinary problems disappear. The 
laboratory then becomes in reality what it is in theory, 
a workshop where every pupil in some large degree 
keeps himself at work because of natural incentives. 
This is the ideal situation toward which to work. The 
chief virtue of the project method of teaching depends 
upon this self-motivation of the worker.

  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
The laboratory manual is, perhaps, the chief single 
instrumentality employed by an instructor to attain the 
teaching purposes of secondary school sciences. Es- 
pecially is this the case in the smaller high schools, and 
with beginners in science teaching, whatever the sci- 
ence subject taught and however independent of manu- 
als some science teachers in time become. A skilled 
mechanic does not undertake to build furniture and 
do cabinet work with a pocket knife, nor is worth while 
dental work done by use of carpenter’s tools. Choice 
of suitable laboratory manuals precedes and is vital 
to effective laboratory instruction and laboratory train- 
ing. A makeshift for a laboratory manual imperils suc- 
cessful science teaching, and impeaches the importance 
attached to the laboratory side of science instruction. 
In accordance with their own experience and that 
of other science teachers it is the belief of the authors 
that to secure the largest educational values from a 
manual requires that it be used as a guide for class- 
room practice as well as for laboratory procedure. 
Where the instruction in secondary school sciences ac- 
tually is on a laboratory basis, both the order of topics 
followed and the amount of text matter for which 
pupils are held responsible will depend upon the man- 
ual employed. All necessary adjustments of a pub- 
lished manual to the particular needs of a class, school, 
or instructor, will correspond in a measure to the alter- 
ations which are needed in a ready-made “standard- 
ized” suit of clothes when fitted to an individual cus- 
20
-P-A-G-E-33
  CHARACTER OF THE LABORATORY EXERCISES 
tomer. In either case a misfit entails grief and disap- 
pointment. Where the manual in use does not thus 
offer comprehensive guidance for the course a teacher 
himself must become the unifying agent, building up 
around the laboratory work the other units of class- 
room discussion—text and reference work, industrial 
or other contacts with daily life, and all oral or written 
reviews and examinations. It requires a large degree 
of ability to do this well, but in the hands of an ex- 
perienced science teacher it yields acceptable results. 
The beginner of necessity must use as best he may the 
tools furnished for his work. 
The type of manual long familiar in high school sci- 
ence teaching has been a rather inexpensive book of 
directions to pupils for working experiments. These 
directions are often models of brevity and clearness. 
But often they lack sufficient appeal to pupils in any 
requirements of what is well worth doing as problems 
involving life interests. These manuals at times are 
made more attractive, and their directions more definite 
and concise, by use of wisely chosen cuts and diagrams. 
Tables, too, and various other data appended furnish 
information, valuable alike to teacher and pupil in 
connection with the laboratory exercises. But admir- 
able as are many of these manuals whose contents are 
thus characterized, their use often leaves much to be 
desired of them. Some teaching ends of supreme im- 
portance are apparently not to be attained by their 
use. The science teacher of beginning courses cannot 
21 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
understand why he fails in his teaching efforts. Pupils 
who painstakingly complete these laboratory courses 
all too commonly fail of acquiring either a scientific 
spirit, or a procedure characteristic of scientific effort 
in its application to life problems. 
§A manual must in the first place lend itself to the 
conception that a laboratory hour is a study period. 
Under guidance of the instructor it is possible during 
this laboratory hour to secure methodical and sustained 
training of pupils day by day in those ways of acquir- 
ing knowledge which are characteristically scientific. 
In the second place, it should provide for such guid- 
ance of the pupils that whatever knowledge they may 
have of the topic under discussion can be assembled 
through questioning, and organized about the results 
of certain experimental work done by the teacher. Ob- 
viously these teacher’s experiments must be simple, 
few in number, and so chosen that a scientific under- 
standing of both the old and the newly acquired knowl- 
edge results. These experiments should be such as to 
arouse and sustain interest, provoke thought, and be- 
come centers of instruction. The question list and the 
experiments so far as these concern the needs of many 
teachers may be suggestive only, or there may be a 
mere skeleton of a progressive thought activity the de- 
tailed steps in the development of which are left toethe 
instructor. But for use of inexperienced teachers gen- 
erally it is probable that a manual should furnish a 
well-considered series of questions and experiments. 
22
-P-A-G-E-35
CHARACTER OF THE LABORATORY EXERCISES 
It is likely to be more serviceable, and at the same time 
it is none the less suggestive to instructors desirous of 
freedom in choices of material and in the order of 
its use. 
In the manual, too, should be incorporated lists of 
experiments to be worked by pupils only. There should 
be some few optional experiments for use by the in- 
structor when needed for extending and enriching the 
instruction, or at times for use by the more ambitious 
and capable pupils. 
Included in the manual should be lists of Exercises 
designed to serve several ends, one of which is a review 
of what has presumably been under discussion in con- 
nection with the experimental work. Other questions 
may very properly anticipate difficulties likely to be 
experienced later by pupils in textbook assignments, 
thus necessitating a discriminating use of the text and 
of other reference books for information of a specific 
character. Problems and other exercises of a quan- 
titative character may likewise be included as an ap- 
plication of what has been taught, paving the way for 
any suitable quantitative experimental work. In this 
connection there may be topical and theme require- 
ments, either with or without outlines, and these should 
include industrial as well as scientific aspects of topics 
studied. i 
In so far as there is an experimental basis for it, the 
manual may appropriate to some extent the develop- 
ment of certain of the theories of science. Although 
23 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
teachers must ever be dependent upon textbooks for an 
orderly presentation of the facts of a subject studied, 
and for a well-digested and well-balanced presentation 
_ of scientific theory, there is little likelihood of failure to 
leave for subsequent discussion in connection with text 
assignments difficulties sufficient to tax fully both 
teacher and pupils. 
Instruction in secondary school sciences thus is made 
to center in the manual, and by use of it the teacher 
is aided in developing the subject topic by topic. The 
text supplements these science studies, and the num- 
ber of texts needed by a class is a matter of how many 
are needed for reference purposes, and in preparation 
for “quizzes” on text assignments. Every pupil should, 
however, have a manual for individual use as it is 
' his guide in the primary and fundamental stages of his 
studies. In connection with its several topics, and es- 
pecially with classes of beginners, assignments should 
be made by a teacher of carefully chosen page-and- 
page references to the text used. This in nowise pre- 
cludes use by pupils of any other references desired. 
This insures always a definiteness of assignment not 
open to question by pupils who for any reason may be 
indifferent to the work. It constitutes a minimum of 
text requirements of all pupils in a class. It keeps con- 
sistently before the minds of pupils, too, the distinc- 
tion on the one hand between the study of science from 
the experiences of life and the phenomena of the lab-

  CHAPTER III 
WRITTEN WORK OF THE LABORATORY, 
AND THE KEEPING OF NOTEBOOKS 
To designate notebooks as one of the necessary evils 
of teaching is an inadequate conception of their worth. 
On the other hand, a wholly fictitious value is easily 
given them. Many a teacher, slaving over the mass 
of written matter that is ever accumulating from his 
classes in spite of his best endeavors, would abolish 
notebooks as the only solution of the problem they 
present. As a means to an end the written work re- 
quired of pupils presents to teachers no new problem. 
It is largely a question of whether or not one shall 
be master of the means at hand for accomplishing a 
desired end, or whether the end shall become obscured 
by the means employed. A proper conception of the 
purposes of notebook keeping, and of the limitations 
that must be observed by the teacher in the use of 
notebooks, should make it unnecessary to become a 
slave to “reading papers” notwithstanding the large 
amount of written work required for teaching efficiency. 
It is foreign to our purposes here to enter into any 
discussion of details of keeping notebooks, and of the 
forms best suited to different science branches in high 
27
-P-A-G-E-40
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
schools. Much such information helpful to beginners 
in science teaching is to be found in published labora- 
tory manuals. Most teachers sooner or later formulate 
plans of their own especially suited to their personal 
views and their teaching conditions. It is worth while, 
however, to discuss in this connection some general 
principles applicable to all secondary school sciences 
and to all teachers. 
In the teaching processes of the public schools there 
can be no substitute for the written work required of 
pupils. It demands of every pupil a degree of mental 
effort in formulating thought, and in giving it con- 
cise expression, which is of largest teaching value. In 
the recitation the pupil’s mind may wander far from 
the subject in hand. In the laboratory he may waste 
time in play or idleness. But when it comes to pro- 
ducing an acceptable written account of what he did, 
and saw, and thought about it, the demands made of 
him must be met. A chief virtue of the requirement of 
keeping a notebook is that it demands of every pupil 
an actual consideration of the work in question. It 
offers also the best possible opportunity for a teacher 
to learn the mental attitude and readiness of individual 
pupils in a class, their difficulties in grasping thought 
relationships, the extent of their vocabularies, and 
their earnestness of effort. Careless and hasty ways 
of expression, of observation, and of inference are 
strikingly apparent to a discerning reader of the 
written work of pupils. 
28 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
WRITTEN WORK OF THE LABORATORY 
In the review and correction of notebooks and other 
written work handed in by pupils, the first and fore- 
most end to be attained is such an insight into the 
manner of thought and the mental state of those whose 
written work is reviewed day by day as shall suggest 
what teaching procedure with them is likely to be most 
effective. Misspelled words should be noted, and 
grades may be assigned. But these corrections are of 
secondary importance to the determination by a 
teacher from such papers as come under review each 
time what seems.to be the next step in the teaching 
procedure for the class as a whole, and what the most 
helpful course to pursue with those whose papers re- 
veal need of special assistance. 
This requires, of course, that papers handed in shall 
not be allowed to accumulate. So many of them as 
may be considered necessary should be reviewed, and 
all papers so far as possible should be returned to the 
pupil before the next class period. The demands of 
the written work are then fresh in the minds of the 
pupils, as are the difficulties experienced by them. The 
explanations given by the teacher to clear up any and 
all such difficulties meet a conscious need on the part 
of those whose written work was faulty. Teaching of 
the most vital sort is possible at these times when the 
significance and the accuracy of results of the labora- 
tory work are under discussion. The use of this written 
work from the laboratory as basis for instruction gives 
it the proper perspective in the teaching process in 
29
-P-A-G-E-42
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
the minds of pupils. Its requirements and its under- 
standing are fundamental in the mastery of the sci- 
ences studied, not merely incidental and of the nature 
of “busy work.” Any review of papers made after long 
intervals possesses little or no interest to pupils be- 
yond noting what grades, if any, are on the papers. 
As soon as a record has been made of papers handed 
in (or not handed in), and a certain few of them have 
been selected by the teacher for correction, the others 
may at once be stamped “Not Reviewed” and distrib- 
uted in file cases for the pupils when they come to 
class next day. This stamp mark relieves the in- 
structor of responsibility for any errors which may ap- 
pear in a paper, and is notice to the individual pupil 
that there is need of careful attention during the dis- 
cussion of the laboratory work in the succeeding class 
period so that all errors in his paper may be noted 
and corrected. 
Copying any poorly prepared papers to improve their 
content or their appearance is largely a disciplinary 
measure. Its instructional worth is of doubtful value. 
In the affairs of men as a rule measures must stand 
or fall as first presented. The next day or the next 
hour has its own duties that should not be interfered 
with by attempts to “make good” on past delinquencies. 
This in nowise means that in teaching as in life affairs 
generally these “duties” may not be and at times must 
be the reviewing and recasting of what has before been 
attempted, but what was so poorly done as to demand 
30
-P-A-G-E-43
  WRITTEN WORK OF THE LABORATORY 
redoing. Removal of faulty construction, and its re- 
placement by what is perfect in workmanship, is the 
rule in engineering and architectural enterprises even 
as it should be in the building of mental and moral 
natures. To substitute for what is not “good” that 
which is “better” is the essence of educational effort. 
But instructors should not degrade what is supposedly 
constructive, and intended for betterment, into a time- 
wasting procedure. 
Much of the crediting on laboratory record books of 
papers handed in, together with all stamping and filing 
of papers to be returned, can be done by pupil assist- 
ants. Frequently where it seems unnecessary or is 
impossible for the teacher himself to read all the papers, 
the chief objects of the written work are attained 
where corrections of one another’s papers are made 
by pupils in class. Each answer as read from a paper 
can be criticized by any member of the class, and when 
necessary by the teacher. The answers can be graded 
one after another by the pupils having the papers. 
Since pupils very commonly have an exaggerated no- 
tion of the value of grades, it will be well to get the 
papers back to those who wrote them, and to take a 
few minutes to allow any protests of the grading when 
thought unfair. 
No one but the instructor, however, should review 
and correct the selected papers from which to gain in- 
formation and suggestion for the next day’s teaching. 
Whether grade marks are assigned or not to these pa- 
31
-P-A-G-E-44
TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
pers, their review should be done as carefully as with 
the formal test papers from examinations, and grades 
should be recorded in a laboratory book for the in- 
structor’s use. Though the educational value of pre- 
serving the written work of the laboratory be consid- 
ered in itself as negligible, other considerations make a 
methodical painstaking keeping of notebooks impor- 
tant. Wholly aside from any possible value for review 
purposes, a carefully kept notebook in any science 
branch is ever present evidence to pupils of the con- 
tinuity, organization, and content of the course. The 
pride taken in having a complete notebook is no mean 
factor in a sustained interest in any science subject. 
As a matter of discipline in order to secure the neces- 
sary sustained effort throughout a semester or year it 
may at times be necessary to resort to the requirement, 
“No book, no grade.” 
As conditions permit, it is very helpful to go over 
their notes with certain pupils individually, giving each 
pupil a few minutes for consultation at his own seat 
or beside the teacher’s desk. The good features of the 
pupil’s work can then be complimented, his errors tact- 
fully corrected, and suggestions of a general nature 
made as to possible improvement. At the same time 
valuable information will be gained by the instructor 
concerning the success or failure of his method of 
presentation of the subject taught. This consultation: 
on notebooks can usually be done best when the class 
as a whole is busy writing notes on recently completed 
32
-P-A-G-E-45
  WRITTEN WORK OF THE LABORATORY 
laboratory work. The personal contact between 
teacher and pupil while considering the notebook to- 
gether may be made an invaluable teaching influence. 
It should be cultivated tactfully at all times, and it is 
especially valuable during the early part of the course 
when pupils most readily get into right habits of note- 
book keeping. 
With the ends of notebook keeping such as set forth 
above, there is no need for “reading notebooks.” Each 
day’s work is cleared up as the work progresses, and 
the accumulated written work from the laboratory 
shows on the face of each set of exercises whether or 
not papers have been corrected by the teacher. During 
the first weeks of any semester, it is well to call in all 
the notebooks several times for the immediate pur- 
pose of noting whether or not the directions given for 
notebook keeping are being followed out, and whether 
the papers are preserved as required. Where all note- 
books are required kept at all times in the depart- 
ment, they are always available for inspection by the 
teacher, and are never forgotten or left at home by 
the pupil. This latter plan requires, of course, that 
all work on the notebooks be done in school. 
Shiftless ways in written work, and all slovenly 
habits are too serious a matter to be tolerated. The 
sooner remedial measures are applied where needed 
the better. Careless and untidy work, illegible writ- 
ing, poor spelling, lack of punctuation, and disregard 
of directions as to form and appearance, are matters

CHAPTER IV 
LABORATORY ARRANGEMENT AND EQUIPMENT 
“Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy” may at 
times express the thought of a taxpayer as he inspects 
modern laboratories and their equipment in some of 
the larger secondary schools, and again when he audits 
bills for laboratory supplies and upkeep. In marked 
contrast to this, however, the equipment and supplies 
of the smaller high schools oftentimes will be found 
wretchedly inadequate for the teaching undertaken. 
Oftentimes this pinch of poverty in the science courses 
like that not infrequently found in the tenement house 
districts is directly traceable to wastes resulting from 
ignorance in making purchases, and from shiftlessness 
in care of what has been purchased. Liberal treat- 
ment by superintendents and school boards may be 
won or lost to science teachers and their successors 
through competency or incompetency in use and stor- 
age of science apparatus and supplies. 
Both school architecture and school furniture are 
now so fully standardized that in cities and larger 
towns science teachers are largely spared responsibili- 
ties for the arrangement and equipment of laboratories 
and classrooms. But there are yet many schools in 
35 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
which science is taught under the heavy handicap of 
ill-advised furnishings, and where available funds for 
betterments are so limited that small outlays to im- 
prove the teaching service assume an undue impor- 
tance. It is chiefly with the needs and the teaching 
conditions in these smaller high schools that we are 
here concerned since the special teacher for a single 
science subject in any large well-equipped high school 
is likely to know better than can be told him what his 
particular teaching conditions require. In the smaller 
high schools where one teacher has, it may be, all the 
science subjects, the teaching problems are entirely dif- 
ferent from those of special teachers in large high 
schools. Nevertheless, economy rather than waste ap- 
plies equally well to all science teachers, and is as 
applicable to their time and energy as it is to expendi- 
tures for apparatus and supplies. 
[From time to time science teachers are called upon 
to consult with architects in connection with location 
and arrangement of laboratories in new school build- 
ings. There are details of construction essential to 
efficient laboratory service which are likely to be over- 
looked save in those cases where a specially trained 
school architect is employed. One of these items which 
is of much importance is a good arrangement of rooms 
as “floor plan” for the science department. The type 
of arrangement in which the rooms used for the sci- 
ence subjects are strung out in a long line is strictly 
to be avoided. Such a scheme usually results from 
36
-P-A-G-E-49
  LABORATORY ARRANGEMENT AND EQUIPMENT 
an attempt to use as laboratories rooms designed for 
classrooms. 
The rooms of a science department should be 
grouped, centering preferably around supply rooms. 
There should be direct access from the supply room 
into each of the other rooms. It should never be nec- 
essary to go out into a corridor to get into another 
science room. Valuable time is wasted in carrying 
apparatus back and forth, and none know better than 
science teachers themselves how many such trips there 
are. If made often during class and laboratory periods, 
room control and class interest are both risked by these 
absences of the instructor. For most sciences a small 
inside dark-room is desirable. 
Since the walls which sustain the weight of the super- 
structure and condition the groupings of science 
rooms rise from the foundations of the building, it is 
very necessary to have any desired arrangement of 
science rooms incorporated into the general plan at 
the very first, especially as concerns plumbing, gas 
supply, and electric wiring for these rooms. The 
school architect may not fully appreciate the need for 
greatly increased demands for plumbing facilities in 
laboratories, especially in the chemical laboratory. 
Building conditions wholly unsatisfactory must at 
times go unchanged because of circumstances, and vari- 
ous makeshifts must be endured. But well-lighted, 
*See Appendix B for a desirable floor plan which lends itself to a 
variety of modifications. 
37 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
dry, airy and cheerful rooms only are desirable for 
science laboratories. Basements, attics, unused store- 
rooms, or other unsuitable quarters presume that high 
school pupils will profit from their science subjects in 
spite of school conditions rather than because of them. 
With a laboratory looked upon not only as a workshop 
but a study room as well, the physical conditions there 
should be among the best which the school building af- 
fords. The furnishings, too, should be substantial 
rather than showy, and so designed and constructed as 
to be durable, showing when properly used relatively 
little wear from long service. Nothing dilapidated and 
run-down is to be tolerated in connection with furni- 
ture and apparatus. Fortunately the serviceableness 
of furniture and apparatus is not in any considerable 
degree conditioned upon its appearance and cost. 
No attempt is here made to enter at length into de- 
tails of equipment for teaching the various secondary 
school sciences. The number of science subjects, and 
the special equipment these demand, makes such dis- 
cussions out of the question here. However, there is 
enough of conformity to types, and of tendency to 
standardize essentials in high school sciences, that 
equipment may be considered more a matter of extent 
than of kind. So complete in design and appointments 
are standardized laboratory fixtures purchasable ready- 
made in the market, that the question for consideration 
concerning laboratory furniture is the relative cost and 
excellence of the output of factories specializing in 
38
-P-A-G-E-51
  LABORATORY ARRANGEMENT AND EQUIPMENT 
laboratory furniture on the one hand, and what may 
be had as home construction on the other. Cuts and 
specifications such as are to be found in catalogues of 
manufacturers of laboratory furniture may be con- 
sulted to good advantage whatever the source whence 
the furniture may be obtained finally. Oftentimes 
economy of space is as important as original outlay for 
furnishings, the floor space set aside for science in 
school buildings often being inadequate. Proper allow- 
ance of working space for pupils in a laboratory con- 
tributes to better discipline as well as to greater care- 
fulness and fewer accidents in the use of apparatus. 
Suitable passage space between pupils at work at ad- 
jacent tables must always be provided. (See scale 
drawing of one arrangement in Appendix B.) An 
adaptation of standardized specifications in some cases 
may be more satisfactory than furnishings from original 
plans.” 
Perhaps no one waste in connection with laboratory 
sciences in high schools is greater than that in con- 
nection with the misuse and lack of care of apparatus 
already purchased. Oftentimes this waste is directly 
chargeable to inefficiency and shiftlessness on the part 
of a teacher, but not infrequently it is due to lack of 
suitable storage and repair facilities. Teachers should

not be held responsible for the proper care of apparatus 
where ample and suitable storage is not provided. 
ases and closets for exclusive use of laboratory outfit 
and supplies constitute a first consideration in equip- 
ping rooms to be used for science teaching. Science 
teachers only can fully appreciate the convenience of 
and necessity for it. The amount of storage space re- 
quired is large, especially where several sciences are 
to be taught. To find expensive electrical and other 
apparatus “stored” on window sills and side tables, and- 
to see chemicals whether in bottles, cartons, or pack- 
ages crowded indiscriminately upon the shelves of 
dark closets, is indicative of lack of self-respect on the 
part of a teacher as well as culpable negligence and 
waste of public funds on the part of school authorities. 
The disorderly arrangement of poorly labelled chemi- 
cals may be decidedly dangerous because of the in- 
creased chances of error in selecting substances for ex- 
periments. 
Whatever type of laboratory table comes under dis- 
cussion, a solid well-built frame, and the best top at- 
tainable, constitute the essential features. If wood 
tops are used for lecture tables in chemistry, and in 
other laboratories where liquids are likely to be spilled, 
they. should be at least one and three-fourths inches 
thick, and so dovetailed, glued, and bolted that no 
cracks will ever open in them. This necessitates the 
use of lumber thoroughly seasoned, and so finished on 
top and edges that no liquid can be absorbed into the 
40 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  LABORATORY ARRANGEMENT AND EQUIPMENT 
wood. Table tops finished a dull black by treatment 
with chemicals, making them “acid proof,” are prefer- 
able by far to highly polished and varnished surfaces. 
(See Appendix B.) In larger schools with large use 
made of chemistry tables by numerous laboratory sec- 
tions, table tops of more durable material than wood 
are desirable. They are more economical in the long 
run. 
Preferably no openings should be cut in the tops of 
tables unless for gas jets, and except possibly in the 
chemistry laboratory all sinks should be placed along 
the walls within easy reach of pupils at work. This 
eliminates much unsightliness even in well-kept lab- 
oratories. It costs less for plumbing where pipes can 
follow the walls. Where sinks are in the tops of 
tables there is likely to be an unsightly crack around 
the edges of the sink top, and a spattering of water 
on the table top from the faucets. A lesser evil is to 
have the sinks placed at the ends of the tables. Small 
jars well glazed within and without may be kept on 
the chemistry tables during a laboratory period into 
which all waste solids and liquids may handily be 
emptied. When filled these jars can quickly be drained 
of their liquid contents at a sink, and the solids dumped 
into a large waste jar for the janitor’s care. In large 
chemistry laboratories the sinks may drain into a lead- 
lined or alberene catch basin having an outlet pipe 
standing six or eight inches above the bottom of the 
basin, and suitably capped with a strainer. In this 
Al \
-P-A-G-E-54
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
way all acids and alkalies are sufficiently diluted to 
lessen materially any corrosion of the drainage pipes. 
The liquid in this catch basin must of course be flushed 
out every time after use. (See Chemistry, p. 277.) 
For microscope work in Botany light preferably 
should be from north windows; in Physics direct sun- 
light through south windows is desirable. A good qual- 
ity of window shades should be provided, sufficiently 
opaque to darken satisfactorily any room desired. Gas 
and electric lights now commonly available should be 
arranged wherever likely to be needed when any school 
building is erected. There must be gas connections on 
the chemistry tables; in other laboratories the gas may 
be on the tables at one side of the room near sinks. 
The same classrooms and laboratories may be used in 
common for different sciences, especially when under 
direction of the same teacher. Even the room set 
apart for a chemistry laboratory may be used for other 
classes when not needed for chemistry, in case it be 
sufficiently large and well-ventilated and properly 
seated. 
But when any such use is made of the laboratory the 
greatest care must be taken lest pupils not in chem- 
istry classes injure themselves or their clothing by 
meddling with acids or chemicals at hand. Pupils who 
are regular members of laboratory classes are sup- 
posedly trained not to molest materials, but other 
pupils using the room are peculiarly likely to be 
tempted to play with the chemicals. The greatest 
42 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  LABORATORY ARRANGEMENT AND EQUIPMENT 
alertness on the part of the teachers, and considerable 
tact in enforcement of rules forbidding any tampering 
with apparatus and materials, will be required in order 
to avoid deplorable accidents. 
Small deposit fees collected of pupils at the time 
of registration for such laboratory subjects as chem- 
istry provide a sinking fund for repairs and replace- 
ments which are made necessary by reason of acci- 
dents and various laboratory exigencies. As a rule 
these moneys should be expended only upon request 
of the science teacher, and any such charges must never 
be so heavy as to be a hardship for pupils taking sci- 
ence subjects. Such a fund is extremely valuable, too, 
since it can be used on short notice as needs arise with- 
out necessity of placement of an “order” with the pur- 
chasing department. When ice is needed, for example, 
a boy can be sent for it with the money from a cash 
fund on hand. No amount of foresight provides for 
every item of possible expenditure in the makeup of 
a year’s budget, and a petty cash fund becomes a neces- 
sity. A refund made to pupils at the end of the course 
as supplies are turned in, serves as a check on the care- 
lessness of pupils as well as to provide a fund. The 
charges are best collected at the school office at the 
beginning of a semester, and refunds should be made 
there to pupils on basis of report from the science in- 
structor of deductions to be made. Since generally 
it is unwise for any science instructor himself to col- 
lect and disburse moneys from pupils, all emergency 
43 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
expenditures should be made through the school office 
but always on order from the science teacher only.* 
_. In schools where annual outlays for science appar- 
atus and supplies are considerable, a budget system for 
all the sciences is desirable. An itemized list of needs 
for the ensuing year should be prepared for the school 
authorities early every spring. This makes possible a 
scrutiny of items with view to economy in all outlays 
made, as well as serviceableness of material purchased. 
In lists submitted to dealers in supplies there should 
be provision that bids are to be “upon all or any part” 
of the list. Selections can then be made more advan- 
tageously. Presumably but not necessarily choices 
made will be the lowest bids on items. Usually where 
the consideration is but a slight difference in prices, it 
is better not to scatter these purchases too much. It 
involves separate shipments and deliveries of goods, 
and the opening of accounts with different firms. 
*One satisfactory method of collecting such a fund, especially 
with larger classes using extensive outfits, consists in taking receipts 
from each pupil at the beginning of a ‘semester for one complete 
list of apparatus in good condition. Printed slips fitting a loose 
leaf pocket ledger are handy. These slips should contain an itemized 
- list of the apparatus usually issued, and the price of each article 
should be carried out to the right hand margin. If extra apparatus 
is taken out of the stock room by pupils during the semester, pupils 
should sign a “Day Book” slip for each piece. A pupil assistant 
can copy such daily slips to the proper ledger pages. At the end 
of the semester all pupils return such apparatus as they still 
possess for credit, and are charged for missing or broken items. 
Their bills should be paid at the financial office of the school, and 
the amounts thus retained constitute a “Science Fund.”

CHAPTER V 
TEXTBOOKS IN SCIENCE TEACHING, 
AND THEIR PURPOSES 
In the earlier stages of development in a new field 
of knowledge practically all the facts in regard to it 
are in possession of a few individuals. As a rule these 
facts are few in number, and there is little of logical 
relationship between them. As more and more facts 
become known, and their inter-relationships become 
realized, speculation as to the probable underlying 
causes of various groups of phenomena is attempted. 
As the more promising hypotheses attract attention, 
much work is done in attempts to sustain or to dis- 
prove them. Such of these hypotheses as are found in 
accord with the facts of all situations where they 
are applicable are accepted as working hypotheses, and 
become established as theories. A great body of knowl- 
edge by this time will supposedly have been assembled 
and systematically grouped in accordance with these 
theories. At this stage we have a full-fledged science, 
and it is now time for textbooks to be written in order 
to bring before students, whether as beginners or those 
more advanced in the subject, a selected body of facts 
and theories together with their applications in the 
affairs of life. 
46
-P-A-G-E-59
  TEXTBOOKS IN SCIENCE TEACHING 
Without such a presentation of what has been 
learned by others, a beginner as a student in that field 
of knowledge would of necessity have to rediscover 
and reorganize all that his predecessors in that field had 
slowly and painfully wrought out and made known. 
He has now, so to speak, the advantage of maps of 
the field as made by them. Such is a major purpose in 
having a textbook. It brings to a student the essen- 
tials of a subject as these have been gained and evalu- 
ated by others, with facts pertaining to the subject pre- 
sented it may be in an order partly logical and partly 
chronological. These facts are put together upon a 
framework of theory, and to this is related such appli- 
cations, illustrations, and exercises as make the sub- 
ject more interesting and more profitable to the 
student. 
In our consideration of the function of laboratory 
work, much emphasis was placed upon the value of 
first-hand efforts to acquire knowledge, but that proc- 
ess in its very nature is slow and laborious. In spite 
of the unexcelled merit of laboratory work as an exer- 
cise in mental training, only a modest portion of any 
well-established science can be learned first-hand by 
the student of to-day. A great proportion of what is 
considered necessary to learn in any field of science 
must come to him in other ways, and much of it by 
necessity from an intelligent use of well-selected texts. 
Most science teachers are fairly well agreed that the 
use of a text should follow rather than precede intro- 
« 47
-P-A-G-E-60
    TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
ductory laboratory exercises. After a class has gained 
some first-hand acquaintance with a topic by contact 
with it in the laboratory, and the relatively meager 
amount of knowledge thus gained has been discussed 
and written up, students should be directed to a good 
textbook to get the benefit of what has been learned 
upon these topics by others, and what is thought about 
them by the best authorities./ From these textbooks 
students learn Avhat uses are made of this scientific in- 
formation, and how it may concern us in our homes and 
in our life careers. “The text should contain stimulating 
exercises, too, in connection with each topic so that 
the extent and definiteness of one’s knowledge of a 
subject can be tested by attempts to apply it to those 
new conditions set forth in the various situations and 
problems given. In this way the essentials of these 
matters become fixed in memory, enriching life with 
much that is of interest. 
With this method of allowing the use of a text to 
follow the laboratory attack upon new material we 
have an excellent guide as to what parts of the text 
shall be used and what parts omitted. Texts often 
are compromises built to suit “many men of many 
minds.” In consequence nearly all texts contain more 
material than can be even apprehended much less 
comprehended by any one student in the time usually 
available for a course. Some of the poor results com- 
plained of in science teaching may often be accounted 
48
-P-A-G-E-61
  TEXTBOOKS IN SCIENCE TEACHING 
for as due to efforts on the part of teachers to cover 
too much ground. An intensive consideration of fewer 
‘topics commonly gives better results in science teach- 
ing. With a well-prepared outline of topics to be 
taught, and with a laboratory course adapted to this 
outline, a teacher is in a better position to select por- 
tions of a text in supplementing other sources of in- 
formation upon any topic. 
A suitable distribution of the theoretical parts of a 
subject in a textbook for use by beginners necessitates 
thoughtful consideration when preparing an outline of 
a course. If a text must be used which does not con- 
form with an instructor’s ideas in this regard, it often 
is well to follow an outline, using the textbook presen- 
tation of any theory after enough facts pertaining to 
it have been accumulated to warrant discussion of it 
and its applications. There is no serious objection to 
use of an outline which has an order of topics unlike 
that followed by the text used. Only lazy and incom- 
petent teachers slavishly follow even the best of texts. 
Beginners in teaching, however, may safely venture 
to do the thing which seems best to them only after 
due consideration, and whenever possible only after 
consultation with successful teachers who are more 
*A recent move on the part of the American Chemical Society, 
which has a committee on Chemical Education at work on A

to do similar work for other sciences.

    TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
experienced. Boys and girls rather than books are to 
be taught, and the work to be of value must be alive 
and original rather than dead and imitative. 
In a presentation of the theoretical portions of a 
science the teacher if at all experienced should usually 
give to the class the first discussions of it. He can 
adapt what is to be taught to his pupils, amplifying 
the teachings of the text as necessary. Study of the 
text then follows profitably since in his exposition of 
theory the writer of a science textbook supposedly 
employs carefully chosen words and concise forms of 
expression. In language suited to those who are to 
use the book, he has endeavored to set forth scientific 
beliefs which are generally accepted. 
The organization of the subject matter of a text as 
a whole by the author requires a relatively advanced 
stage of mastery of the science concerned. It presup- 
poses a large amount of material to be considered, 
much of which cannot for lack of space be incorporated 
into a textbook. This excludes many minor relation- 
ships inferred directly from phenomena, and much 
other first-hand information. ("Theoretical then, a 
text is not to be used by beginnérs as a primary source 
of information upon any topic. It may be supposed 
to tax the ability of advanced students in its particular 
field in an endeavor to master satisfactorily its gen- 
eralizations and applications. It sets forth a last stage 
in the organization of knowledge into a science. It 
uses the theories and laws of that science as its frame- 
50
-P-A-G-E-63
  TEXTBOOKS IN SCIENCE TEACHING 
in that particular field of learning. 
Teaching experience, however,~warrants sustained 
efforts throughout a science course to have beginners 
comprehend something of the theoretical side of sci- 
ence. The time allotted any one school science is all too 
short. Every means at hand for its mastery must be 
used, and it is upon the text very largely that pupil 
and teacher must rely for a clear-cut condensed presen- 
tation of scientific theory. Much of utmost worth edu- 
cationally may be learned in any of the sciences with 
little or none of the related theories, but it is knowledge 
without organization. Because of its fragmentary char- 
acter it lacks significance and it is soon forgotten. 
The special difficulties of the theoretical in science 
makes necessary much of discussion, illustration, and 
amplification in class periods. As a matter of teaching 
procedure, and because of difficulties attendant upon 
the growth of true conceptions of the abstract in sci- 
ence, it is wise generally to teach its theories a little 
here and a little there. This is best done in connec- 
tion with those particular facts which serve as a basis 
for any theory. It is usually unwise to attempt the 
mastery of the theoretical portions of the science apart 
by themselves. 
Another important use of the textbook, and one 
for which it is indispensable, arises from the systematic 
continuity and completeness of its discussion of topics. 
It can be assumed that an author has maintained suit- 
51 work. These mark the fining) man’s advance 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
able proportions in these discussions. From them the 
learner gets a right conception of the importance of 
each topic, and of its relationships to the subject as a 
whole. However unobtrusive it may be to the reader 
of a textbook, it is presumed that a proper arrange- 
ment and balance of the important features of the sci- 
ence would appear in any outline made of text matter, 
and that all minor points and illustrations of the text 
would fall naturally into their places in such an out- 
line. There will be perchance many topics considered 
in a high school science where the text is sole source of 
information. There will be times, too, when a pre- 
liminary reading of the text and of other books may be 
necessary to give “point” and purpose to experimental 
work planned, the text furnishing a better introductory 
discussion than could otherwise be provided. 
The order of topics may differ widely in different 
texts in the same science, but their relative major and 
minor values should remain fairly constant in all. A 
text lacking an organization of matter which lends it- 
self to a systematic outline lacks seriously if not fatally 
in teaching value, and makes the mastery of its sub- 
ject matter unduly difficult for pupils. Such consid- 
erations as these should govern one in the selection of 
textbooks. \Systematic and orderly treatment of sub- 
ject matter, natural transitions, gradual increase in 
difficulty, frequent application to the new material of 
what has already been presented, relatively late presen- 
tation of theoretical matter, good summaries of chap- 
52
-P-A-G-E-65
  TEXTBOOKS IN SCIENCE TEACHING 
ters, thought-provoking exercises, problems graded in 
difficulty, and a good index are some of the major 
things to seek. 
A most important feature of a good text is its illus- 
trations. The eye takes in facts and their significance 
as set forth in pictures much more readily than it does 
a message from a printed page. The “legend” accom- 
panying an illustration should furnish wherever pos- 
sible specific information of value additional to text 
discussions. Profusion of illustrations of superior 
teaching worth are supplementary to first-hand lab- 
oratory studies, too, and a substitute for lantern slides 
and educational motion pictures in high schools lack- 
ing equipment of this nature.2 To show connections 
of parts in apparatus set up, the structural relationships 
of plant growths and the working parts of machines, 
cross-section drawings serve better than photos or per- 
spectives. Cuts are not to be “just pictures,” serving 
to embellish the pages. They should be so chosen as 
to have in themselves large teaching values, setting 
forth the teachings intended more concisely and more 
completely than could be done in words using the 
same amount of space. The “Exercises” at the close 
of the several chapters, whether in connection with or 
in lieu of a “Summary,” serve chiefly, it may be, for 
reviews. But they should include, too, thought-pro- 
voking questions, calling attention to relationships and

53
-P-A-G-E-66
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
applications likely to be neglected or overlooked, and 
requiring the use of the text as a source of informa- 
tion. Numerical exercises furnished by the text may 
very properly be worked out during laboratory hours 
under the supervision of the instructor. As quantita- 
tive exercises they are of the nature of applications of 
the teachings of the text. They serve not only as a test 
of ability to apply these teachings, but because of the 
need for an understanding of the relationships involved 
in their solution they have large teaching worth. Cuts 
of apparatus, assembled for use in connection with de- 
scriptions of experiments whose results are given in 
the text, often convey much desirable information 
more clearly and concisely than is possible by use of 
formal text narrative. 
All these various uses and modifications of form in 
text matter are wholly compatible with the use of a 
text during laboratory time as a reference book whence 
to get information on specific points. To make pos- 
sible the largest usefulness of a text it must have an 
“Tndex” by means of which the contents of the book 
are made available with all the readiness and complete- 
ness characteristic of the best reference books. A text 
lacking a good index is of little value in training pupils 
to be self-reliant in study. “These uses of a textbook 
as a source of information, taken in connection with 
what is presented by the teacher in class periods during 
review of laboratory papers, narrows the amount of 
matter and range of discussion of its content in any

succeeding class period. While pupils are later held to 
strict account for a mastery of “all that the text gives,” 
much of what is in the book will already have been so 
fully presented as to require little further consideration 
in class. For those pupils who learn more slowly than 
others the text provides a desirable repetition of in- 
struction given by the teacher, or made known in the 
laboratory. There is no time limit upon the use of a 
text by such pupils, and it can be consulted again and 
again. To the slow but earnest student the use of a 
text is a necessity, however brilliant and effective the 
instruction afforded by classroom and laboratory may 
have been.

CHAPTER VI 
CLASS MANAGEMENT 
It would seem that little difference should exist be- 
tween educational ends sought and teaching procedure 
followed whether classes under instruction be in the 
sciences or in other branches of study. A clear percep- 
tion of what these ends are is indispensable to all 
teaching success alike. However, it is in the ways of 
accomplishing these teaching ends that the success or 
failure of beginning courses in science largely lies. De- 
parture from a teaching procedure usually followed in 
other subjects becomes so marked that the special 
procedures found by experience to yield best results in 
science teaching come quite largely to dominate the 
.teaching situation. Instruction in science should be 
based very largely upon knowledge gained first-hand 
through both experience and experiments. And it de- 
mands of the science teacher a conception of class pro- 
cedure peculiar to itself in order to avoid having the 
work degenerate into a mere quiz upon statements 
concerning science such as are to be found in books. 
The class period 1 in part should be given over to an 
enlargement, organization, and enrichment of first- 
*See Introductory Discussion under “Teaching Cycle,”-p. 118. 
57
-P-A-G-E-70
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
hand knowledge of scientific facts and phenomena pre- 
viously acquired by the individual pupils. It should 
be made a thought-provoking period, for which the 
use of texts must be supplementary rather than pre- 
paratory. It is a time for intensive thought-effort on 
the part of every pupil in the class under guidance of 
the instructor. It has primarily to do with relation- 
ships of facts bearing upon the topic under considera- 
tion, whether these facts were gained from experience, 
from teacher, or from books. It is a time to call atten- 
tion to various related phenomena, and to let the class 
consider how the facts or principles recently acquired 
apply to and explain these “problems” brought to their 
attention. 
The class period is indeed a time for teaching. But 
the instruction given seeks primarily to unify and weld 
together a “class knowledge” out of the scattered in- 
formation possessed by the different pupils. It is the 
teacher’s part as an Ynstructor to fill in the existing 
gaps in what is known by the class; to supplement, to 
amplify, and to enrich this knowledge. Any historical 
setting of the subject in hand is best given by the 
teacher at this time. But, regardless of any fund of 
knowledge that the instructor may possess, it assuredly 
is not a time for dumping this information upon a 
class just because the instructor has the information 
to give. There must have arisen some apparent need 
for it, some use that can be made of it, before its full 
teaching value is attained. In the routine work of 
58 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
C )   
CLASS MANAGEMENT 
secondary schools the formal lecture period of the col- 
lege classroom is out of place. 
The quiz, too, as a means whereby the instructor 
may learn how much (or how little) individual pupils 
know of any topic, and how well they may have pre- 
pared upon any assignment, and where further assist- 
ance is needed for the class as a whole, should not be- 
come a mere pumping process characterized by neither 
constructive nor progressive thinking. The quiz is es- 
sentially individual in its demands, while the class 
period is a time rather for team work wherein every one 
of the class keeps step. 
~~ The management demanded for securing a ane in 
class thinking must, of course, be varied. The factors 
involved—teachers, pupils, topic, and the conditions 
under which instruction is given—are all variables. 
But some general principles are worthy of emphasis 
| in this connection. 
  Of one thing teachers are well assured, viz., that 
their pupils will think. They will do that regardless 
of a teacher. The class problem is to control and 
direct their thinking so that desired teaching ends are 
attained. This does not at all imply that pupils are 
equal in their ability to do sustained intensive think- 
ing, but rather that during all the class time the think- 
ing of every member of the class is centered upon the 
topic under consideration. This involves undivided 
attention from every one, and thought-effort that is 
progressive. This must be true, however diverse in 
59 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
definiteness and comprehensiveness the thinking of 
individual pupils may be. 
To the teacher of secondary school sciences more, 
perhaps, than to most other teachers, comes the oppor- 
tunity, the responsibility, the necessity, and the diffi- 
culty of securing constructive class thinking. The 
material is abundant and of a character that makes a 
strong appeal to a wide range of youthful interests, 
inciting to thought activity. But for pupils to acquire 
@ consciousness of power to organize thought material 
requires time. There is a mass of raw material of facts 
and phenomena to be brought together by the pupil, 
and any mastery of the necessary framework of theory 
is a slow process. Even in the elementary phases of 
a science the allotted time for any one science sub- 
ject is likely to be altogether too short. 
As the facts and theories of any science are used 
day by day under the teacher’s direction, it is not 
primarily for the mastery of science by scientists in 
embryo. Rather, the teaching purpose is to establish 
and maintain teaching situations in which shall be 
developed thinking men and women with a scientific 
attitude towards the affairs of life. Men and women 
are needed who desire the facts concerning any prob-

quiring and interpreting such facts as bear upon any 
case, and who can plan and execute in accordance with 
their understanding. Class management then seeks 
to attain more than a mere knowledge of the subject

-P-A-G-E-73
  CLASS MANAGEMENT 
studied. The material of the science subjects is to be 
so used that growth in general capability in all the 
affairs of life is made possible though the subject mat- 
ter of every one of the sciences studied may be for- 
gotten. Whatever may be the immediate end of col- 
lege courses in science, in secondary schools the dom- 
inant purpose is educational rather than scientific. It 
is to fit men and women for the ordinary affairs of life 
rather than to make scientists out of them. 
There is no short cut to attain ends such as these. 
Neither is there any device or scheme warranted to 
succeed in the hands of any and all teachers and under 
all circumstances. However, it is doubtful if any gen- 
eral teaching plan consistently and persistently fol- 
lowed affords larger results than the one briefly set 
forth below: 
(I) Let a large majority of the questions asked be 
thought questions based upon knowledge supposedly 
possessed by all members of the class. This would in- 
clude preceding class and laboratory work, common life 
experiences, and lesson preparations as assigned. By 
varying the form of these questions sufficient emphasis 
for drill work may be secured for those relationships 
having the largest measure of educational worth. 
Whenever possible let the questions concern cases 
commonly known to happen, or that may be made to 
happen before the pupils at the time. Try to get them 
to apply their knowledge of the work in hand to the 
61 
   
-P-A-G-E-74
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
new situations. For example, when a beginning class in 
chemistry has just been studying the oxidation of iron 
by heating, let them attempt to find out the nature and 
action of a “sparkler” ? which as one of the familiar 
forms of fireworks contains iron filings and saltpeter 
as chief constituents. While one cannot always use 
fireworks to drive home a lesson, the alert teacher will 
always find something at hand. 
(II) Expect and eventually insist upon responses by 
the raised hand to every question asked, showing a 
readiness on the part of every one in the class to at- 
tempt an answer. Withholding the hand is a confes- 
sion of inability to answer. As question after question 
is asked, decision on the part of a pupil whether or 
not he knows, and whether or not he will offer to 
answer, together with the mental effort involved in 
framing the answer which he may be called upon to 
give when his hand is raised, maintains an ideal mental 
condition for teaching. It may be attained quickly, 
and be continued throughout the class period. The 
class thought is thus wholly under the control of the 
instructor, with no time for any thinking by the pupils 
*Let members of the class have some of the material from a 
sparkler as they see it burn, catching some of the flying particles 
on white paper. By the use of a magnet and a magnifying glass 
they may be able to distinguish some of the original iron and the 
black magnetic oxide which results from oxidation. The use of the 
saltpeter must_be accounted for, of course, and here they should 
receive help. Relating oxidation by air to oxidation by an oxygen- 
containing compound can be made a natural and easy transition. 
If oxygen be prepared subsequently from potassium chlorate, one 
can then hark back to the potassium nitrate of the sparkler. This 
sort of application and inter-relation of knowledge is the very best 
sort of training. 
62
-P-A-G-E-75
  CLASS MANAGEMENT 
other than what is demanded through the questioning. 
With it all is a sustained training in making prompt 
decisions as to what one knows upon any question, 
and in formulating quickly into words any knowledge 
possessed. 
Though but one pupil may be called upon to give 
voice to any one answer required, every pupil in the 
class has profited by getting ready to give answers. 
In theory at least every pupil answers every question, 
receiving in turn the maximum benefit of the class 
period as a thought exercise. Where any answer as 
given is incomplete or unsatisfactory, other voluntary 
answers may be accepted in place of it or to supplement 
it. Considerable tact is required at such times to avoid 
discouraging the pupil whose answer has been inade- 
quate or incorrect. A kindly treatment of the pupil 
whose answer requires amendment will suffice, and a 
request made of another whose hand may be raised to 
“help out” will carry with it no sting. The teacher’s 
occasional summing up at different stages in the prog- 
ress of the class exercise rounds out and completes the 
whole discussion. 
y Any such plan of instruction is equally applicable in 
many other than science subjects. But the multitude of 
relationships among the facts that constitute the 
subject matter of any high school science, can make its 
use by the science teacher highly effective. Its flexi- 
bility, too, is noteworthy. Questions are readily 
framed that give opportunity for the slowest and dull- 
63
-P-A-G-E-76
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
est ones to do their best, and then again can be made 
sufficiently difficult to tax to the utmost the brightest 
and keenest minds in the class. The teaching value 
of the plan lies, however, in the requirement that every 
pupil decide whether or not he can answer every ques- 
tion; if so, in what words to put the answer. 
There is a vast teaching difference between decisions 
reached upon the pupil’s own initiative, or wrung from 
him unwillingly by reason of insistence of the teacher. 
Pupils who when called upon are able to answer ques- 
tions though their hands were not raised, may be 
asked to explain why their hands were not up, and 
why they are not working with the class. This is a 
disciplinary matter, however. Those seeking credit 
for shallow thinking, soon separate themselves from 
the others by their failures to answer correctly. A 
growing self-consciousness of their fault is likely to 
prove its own corrective. 
The art of questioning that keeps alert every mem- 
ber of the class and carries the discussion forward so 
that at all times the teacher is master of class think- 
ing is, of course, only to be perfected through practice. 
In connection with this questioning, and furnishing no 
inconsiderable part of the facts involved in the discus- 
sion, is the instruction given by the teacher. No bet- 
ter conditions for effective teaching can be attained 
than to have minds alert for information the need of 
which has been made apparent. 
For every new topic taken up in the class period the 
64
-P-A-G-E-77
    CLASS MANAGEMENT 
teacher has recourse for a point of departure to simple 
laboratory exercises which have been performed by the 
pupils or by himself. Lecture table experiments per- 
formed before the class at the time serve to introduce 
pupils to what is yet to be discussed, and to make ap- 
plication of what has been under discussion. 
Class management of this character lessens mate- 
rially any need to provide for so much individual lab- 
oratory work by pupils in the secondary school sci- 
ences. In botany and zodlogy when use is made of the 
compound microscope, and in much of the work in 
chemistry, there is no substitute for individual lab- 
oratory work by pupils. But the science teacher of 
the smaller high schools having several different sci- 
ences to teach is burdened in attempts to prepare for 
individual laboratory work, and to clear away after 
it. The burden often cannot be carried because of 
inadequacy of apparatus and supplies. With much of 
the experimental work in every high school science, 
possibly all of it in some of them, these experiments 
performed by the instructor will yield largely if not 
fully all benefits which theoretically follow from lab- 
oratory exercises performed by the pupils only. It 
has been very truly said,’ however, that when class ex- 
periments take the place of laboratory work by indi- 
viduals, there is likely to occur a separation of the 
class into (a) those who do not even listen as the 
work proceeds; (b) those who do not make the mental

effort involved in formulating answers and giving ex- 
pression to queries arising in connection with the 
phenomena under consideration; (c) those who do not 
observe thoughtfully albeit in appearance listening; 
and (d) those who eagerly endeavor to do all the lis- 
tening, observing, and answering. Such conditions, 
possibly all too common, may justly be considered the 
fault of the instructor, and in large measure unneces- 
sary and impossible with suitable class management.

  CHAPTER VII 
USE OF PROJECTS IN SCIENCE TEACHING 
Confusion in meanings, and much in the way of 
explanations, necessarily resulted from attempts to 
limit the use of the word “projects” with its long-es- 
tablished and varied senses to the greatly restricted sig- 
nificance given it in the professional vocabulary of 
Education. The outcome of these efforts has not been 
wholly a happy one. The advent of project-teaching 
has to science teachers meant the elevation into undue 
prominence of one of the long-used features of science 
teaching which under name of “Semester Themes,” 
“Term Papers,” “Topic Studies,” etc., possessed to 
some extent at least the teaching values now ascribed 
to projects. 
In applications of science to farming, workers in 
experiment stations and students in agricultural col- 
leges long since undertook such projects as a determina- 
tion of the effects of varied soil tillage in potato cul- 
ture, and the nature of diet best for growth of beef 
cattle or milk production. Engineering students un- 
dertook as projects road and bridge building enter- 
prises, studies of drainage and sewerage systems, com- 
munity water supplies, etc. Chemists, physicists, bot- 
68 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
USE OF PROJECTS IN SCIENCE TEACHING 
anists and others in the various fields of science, as 
well as business and professional men, housewives and 
financiers have all had their schemes as “projects” for 
attainment of desired ends which should be advan- 
tageous to them as individuals and to people generally. 
There are reclamation projects, city-planning proj- 
ects, projects in high finance, as well as home-garden 
projects and similar enterprises. Pupils in general sci- 
ence undertake as projects an acquaintanceship with 
and identification of the trees of a community, the col- 
lection and classification and recognition at sight of 
various forms of insects or minerals. All these, sup- 
posedly have as a common factor an impelling desire 
to know, or to achieve, needing only guidance for the 
attainment of desired ends as result of sustained and 
it may be prolonged effort. 
The desirability for transfer of such efforts as these 
from the world of affairs and advanced stages of men- 
tality to the field of secondary education, especially 
into the teaching of high school sciences, is not open 
to question. It became an educational movement 
seized upon by such educators as ever are seeking to 
hear and to tell something new. But for science teach- 
ers too much worth is possessed by projects in instruc- 
tional processes either to discard or to ignore them. 
As in the use of quantitative experiments in physics 
they serve the valuable teaching purpose of keeping 
profitably employed at all times the more rapid workers 
among the pupils of a class. In their use provision is 
69
-P-A-G-E-82
TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
made for a profitable activity on the part of certain 
capable ones whose tastes are specifically developed 
in some particular direction. Through judicious use 
of projects “kept on hand” by science teachers the 
brightest and most capable of a class in any science may 
be kept at work at their best without overtaxing the 
abilities of the less capable by requirements beyond 
their capacities. 
One of the notable characteristics of a project as 
employed in teaching is the supposed desire of a pupil 
for the undertaking. On his own initiative its ac- 
complishment in due time is brought about with a 
minimum of supervision and of assistance on the part 
of an instructor. Where pupils are told to make selec- 
tions from a posted list of titles, and to have projects 
completed at the end of a semester, or other stated 
time, there is occasion to wonder how much there may 
be on the part of any pupil of a desire to engage in the 
undertaking. On the part of a graduate student work- 
ing out his Master’s Thesis an objection of this nature 
may very suitably be waived, of course. But one is 
staggered by the lists of projects furnished for use of 
pupils in general science, and in high school biology. 
Useful as these may be on occasions to the teacher, 
and incidentally to pupils, an undue importance 
is given their teaching value by reason of their 
being so prominently played up in the body of a text. 
*The authors forbear giving any “Lists of Projects.” However 
attractive such lists might be to beginners in teaching, most 
texts and laboratory manuals furnish, or suggest, whatever titles 
may wisely be tried out. 
70
-P-A-G-E-83
  USE OF PROJECTS IN SCIENCE TEACHING 
Ready-made projects at their best are but means 
towards certain well-defined teaching ends. As agen- 
cies in science teaching they are merely incidental to 
and are not fundamental features in the round of 
teaching procedure. Properly employed the project 
is a tool for use by expert teachers; when inadvisably 
employed its worth becomes matter of uncertainty, if 
not wholly negative. A razor suitably handled is an 
admirable tool for the purpose to which it is fitted, 
but its usefulness as a razor is seriously impaired when 
used for sharpening lead pencils, and the boy so using 
it does so at risks to himself. 
Because of the many facts involved in teaching sci- 
ence subjects, and the multitudinous relationships be- 
tween these facts, there is an aspect of project-teach- 
ing of major importance for science teachers. For our 
purposes of discussion it may be designated Teacher’s 
Project in distinction from projects in teaching. In 
these cases the “desire” is in the teacher rather than 
the pupils. The achievements sought are excellencies 
of results in his labors as an instructor and inspirer of 
youth. At all times, while he labors in ways wholly 
practical and common-place, his goal is the fullest 
realization possible for him of the ideals of school- 
room instruction and training. Every lesson, and every 
series of lessons, constitutes an undertaking in the 
planning for which every resource of the teacher is 
employed—knowledge, method and other professional 
71 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
training, knowledge of human nature and of teaching 
situations. 
While the lesson plan required in teacher-training 
courses, and by the principals of some schools of their 
inexperienced teachers, has features in common with 
these teacher’s projects, there are notable distinctions 
to be made. The “Plan” is a requirement which must 
be met under penalty. The teacher’s project is an 
effort initiated by an aspiring teacher himself in order 
to teach pupils rather than lessons. It is one of a 
series of teaching stages in which the lesson plan is a 
component, and withal an important part. Like the 
plan it represents foresight, with adaptation of means 
at hand to the accomplishment of desired ends. But 
it is more than an intellectual effort for organization 
of material for teaching purposes. It involves enthu- 
siasm and sustained effort to make successful an un- 
dertaking. Its success is measured by what is learned 
by the pupils, and in its nature and use it represents 
the “acid test” of teaching ability. 
Where the “desire” of high school pupils to engage 
in some project of whose difficulties they are blissfully 
ignorant is the outgrowth of expectation that by doing 
this they will avoid other and regular requirements 
with whose exactions they are conversant, it augurs 
ill for any large educational values from their efforts. 
Likewise, when the enthusiasm of an instructor leads 
to starting out with projects wholesale in his courses, 
grief attends his undertaking. None better than 
72
-P-A-G-E-85
  USE OF PROJECTS IN SCIENCE TEACHING 
teachers know how much easier it is for them to do a 
thing themselves than to get a pupil to do it well, and 
carrying through a project to completion is no excep- 
tion. To start in upon use of projects with a science 
class, and then never to complete them, may be par- 
doned once by reason of inexperience, and by reason 
of ignorance of the labor these involve for a teacher, 
but all such later undertakings left incomplete con- 
vict a teacher of inefficiency. The value from use of 
projects in instructional processes as in other school 
work is measured by what is accomplished rather than 
by what has been started. 
So much of woe may attend the efforts of a beginner 
in science teaching enthusiastic over the use of pro- 
jects in education, the values of which even under 
favorable circumstances can never be wholly realized, 
that it is not inappropriate here to list a short series 
of “Don’ts” in connection with the use of projects in 
science subjects of both junior and senior high schools. 
Naturally these suggestions are for beginning teachers, 
and have reference to caution to be exercised by reason 
of lack of experience. In nowise do they reflect upon 
the value of projects when used advisedly. Supposedly 
any teacher is to exercise good judgment in a de- 
termination of whether or not these apply to his teach- 
ing conditions: 
I. Don’t enter upon the use of projects wholesale, 
with an accompanying choice (or assignment) of topics 
for all members of a class. It is the part of teaching 
73
-P-A-G-E-86
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
wisdom to begin the use of projects with a few only of 
the pupils of a class, and then only as conditions are 
especially favorable. 
II. Don’t fail to carry to completion whatever is 
undertaken. Don’t be a “beginner.’? 
III. Don’t neglect the use of projects, on the other 
hand, by reason of the labor involved on the part of 
the teacher. They furnish one of the few opportunities 
in the public schools to preserve and promote indi- 
vidual independence and initiative, while at the same 
time codperating and keeping step in a group progress 
whether instructional or civic. Remember that great 
students are made one by one as a product of the skill 
of master teachers. 
In the social order of to-day the “promoter,” and the “organizer,” 
are much in evidence as they “start things.” In school work clubs 
are “started,” officers elected, committees appointed, and funds 
raised sometimes with and oftentimes without wise counsel. The 
wasted energy of these undertakings is large whatever may be the 
benefits derived from efforts put forth. But for teachers to turn 
promoters, and engage in “starting things” which are likely to come 
to naught is non-pedagogical. The training involved for pupils 
has a most serious aspect. At the same time it recalls the rhymes 
from the “Goop Books” (Burgess: Frederick A, Stokes Company) : 
Tony started bright and early clearing up his room; 
Soon he found he had to stop and make a little broom. 
So then he went into the yard to get a little stick, 
But the garden needed weeding, so he set about it quick. 
Then he found his wagon he intended to repair, 
So he went into the cellar for the hammer that was there. 
He just began to build a box when it was time for dinner; 
And that’s why Tony’s father called his son a “good beginner.”

  CHAPTER VIII 
AN EDUCATIONAL CREED IN CONNECTION WITH HIGH 
SCHOOL SCIENCE TEACHING 
The time once was when individuals formulated or 
subscribed to declarations beginning with the words “I 
believe,” etc. In these later days when a lack of well- 
defined beliefs and opinions is painfully apparent in 
the educational world as elsewhere, one may be par- 
doned a desire to see this state of non-belief give way 
to convictions sufficiently positive to endure over a 
season. From the teaching experiences of the past 
there has been organized such a body of educational 
principles and of educational philosophy as taxes the 
ability of each succeeding generation of teachers to 
make suitable application of it all. The task of testing 
out new things in education can be given over to a 
relatively small body of educational leaders, leaving 
to those less experienced the settling of such funda- 
mental questions as “What is it to be educated?” and 
“What is my part in assisting my boys and girls in 
school to acquire an education?” 
In the unending round of “things new in education” 
one is reminded of the great apostle when, speaking to 
the Athenians on Mars Hill, he charged that they spent 
76
-P-A-G-E-89
AN EDUCATIONAL CREED 
their time “in nothing else but to tell or to hear some 
new thing.” Consistency and continuity in educa- 
tional labors require beliefs more firmly fixed than those 
which last only till something new is put forth. Sharp 
distinctions must be made, too, between principles to 
be put into practice, and the processes employed for 
doing this. Each succeeding generation of teachers 
must learn anew all these things. 
Out of unrest and change progress may come, but 
no progress is possible in teaching or elsewhere where 
the teaching procedure found best through experience 
does not abide. In the sciences change in the theories 
held, and in relative values of facts taught, is ever 
occurring. New teaching outfits replace the older and 
less serviceable ones. On the other hand the science 
teacher even as other teachers is profited by taking 
into account educational constants, and in due time 
as a result of personal experiences he, too, should be- 
come able to formulate statements beginning, “Educa- 
tionally, I believe,” ete. 
Among many such possible statements the authors 
venture to suggest by way of illustration some be- 
lieved by them to be fundamental in elementary sci- 
ence teaching, and which very properly should shape 
its entire purpose and procedure: 
(1) To acquire an education, or to become educated, 
involves a desire for knowledge which dominates an 
individual throughout life. Its ends are not attained 
7 
  
ae
-P-A-G-E-90
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
at graduation from school. To aid pupils in getting 
an education is to awaken in them this desire, and so 
to direct it, nourish and stimulate it, that it becomes a 
dominant force in life. 
Teaching as a process implies not only that some one 
give instruction but as well that some one wants to be 
taught. It isa mutual matter, mind acting upon mind. 
Action and reaction if not equal are at least in evidence. 
Upon the teachableness of the learner, his willingness 
to actively respond, hinges very largely the success 
of the teacher. To go through the forms of teaching 
yields no satisfactory results when those under instruc- 
tion have no desire to learn. 
This does not mean that the science teacher whose 
pupils are to make satisfactory educational progress 
under his tuition must sugar-coat and predigest what 
is presented to them. On the other hand, he must 
avoid such choices of matter and of method as will 
result in their dislike or dread of the subject. No really 
fundamental topic in the elementary phases of sci- 
ence subjects needs to be omitted in so doing. There 
will be need at all times of a large measure of teaching 
ingenuity and skill on the part of an instructor. Prog- 
ress at first may be slow, but only as necessary to 
keep pace with the abilities of the pupils to master 
the difficulties of each succeeding topic. [tasee ac- 
count should be made of the fact that in normal human 
lives the greatest measure of satisfaction, and the 
largest degree of happiness, centers in achieving what 
78
-P-A-G-E-91
AN EDUCATIONAL CREED 
is thought to be worth while. The crowning glory of 
it all is the consciousness of possessing the power to 
achieve. } That which has been done may not have 
been easy, but the doing of it fits one to do what is 
yet more difficult. Fitness for yet greater tasks is the 
abundant reward of well doing. It is to be remem- 
bered, however, that what is set as a task for pupils to 
do must appeal to them as something worth doing. 
Herein is a word of warning to the science teacher if 
he would arouse and foster a desire for knowledge in his 
pupils. And herein, also, is an opportunity for influ- 
encing the judgment of pupils concerning what is most 
worth while. 
(2) The school is a place for learning how to satisfy 
this desire for knowledge. The school could not fur- 
nish if it would the varied conditions that come to 
people in later life, nor the complete round of knowl- 
edge required in living.| It cannot teach what should 
be done in all specific cases that may arise in the af- 
fairs of men. The problems of school life, its system 
and outlook, are necessarily more or less unlike those 
of home life, of business, of the industries and the 
professions. While much valuable information of an 
elementary sort can be imparted in schools, far more 
important than the value of this information itself is 
the training which can be given pupils for skill in 
discerning clearly the conditions which enter into any 
problem confronting them and requiring solution, and 
in going at its solution successfully. It is a training 
79
-P-A-G-E-92
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
for general capability and competency, and it finds its 
best expression later in any of the varied walks of life. 
The teacher and textbooks are not available when 
school days are over. But a training may be had in 
school, especially in connection with the study of the 
sciences, which enables one better to assemble the facts 
that have any bearing upon each life interest as it pre- 
sents itself; that recognizes the relative importance of 
these facts and their relationships to one another. This 
should enable one to arrive at beliefs so definite as 
to feel reasonably well assured of success when appli- 
cation is made of them as working hypotheses. The 
school, then, may not only be a place to satisfy im- 
mediate desires for knowledge, but through its training 
there may be given in varying degree to those who 
would avail themselves of it an intellectual skill and 
readiness which will meet all the ordinary demands of 
life. 
The teaching problem, then, becomes one of training 
pupils to be students. Disciplinary measures can be 
enforced, laboratory and examination papers can be 
reviewed and graded, but to bring about in the lives 
of others an habitual attitude and practice such as 
characterizes the student, and to do it largely without 
consciousness on the part of a pupil of the purposes 
of a teacher, requires a continuity of effort that is rare. 
It involves an ability to control the mental activities 
of others not always possessed by those desirous of 
80
-P-A-G-E-93
  AN EDUCATIONAL CREED 
teaching science, even when sufficiently well versed in 
the subjects they desire to teach. However, a clear 
understanding of the problem is necessarily involved in 
preparing boys and girls to be life-long students, and 
masters of the ways of acquiring knowledge. It makes 
the teaching problem no more difficult, and is prelim- 
inary to any solution of it. What it is to study (p. 97) 
is discussed in a later chapter. 
The immediate ends of laboratory and classroom 
work in the sciences of secondary schools is an under- 
standing of the phenomena, the theories, and the prac- 
tical applications of the branch studied. But the ulti- 
mate end of its teaching procedure, exceeding in edu- 
cational worth all the information gained in the course, 
is ability to satisfy one’s desire for knowledge, and 
a self-confidence that one will know better how to 
proceed in mastering situations in life into which he 
ay come. 
[i The science teaching of the secondary school 
ay be so conducted as to develop the initiative in an 
individual—the habit of ascertaining what should be 
done, and undertaking to do it without being told. 
This, too, should be a by-product of science courses, 
and is more valuable than any ability to pass examina- 
tions or to attain high standings in class work. A con- 
fidence in one’s ability when born of achievement is 
fundamental in educational processes. Science teach- 
ers need to subscribe to the belief that secondary school 
81
-P-A-G-E-94

courses can be so shaped as to build up gradually in 
the high school pupil, slowly it may be but nevertheless 
surely, a consciousness of ability to do. 
A desire for knowledge that dominates one’s life, a. 
training in the ways of mastering human learning, and 
a feeling of power within one’s self so to use knowledge 
as to control the affairs of life, are fundamentals in that 
intellectual development of man which is called educa- 
tion. There is no age nor time during life when it 
needs to cease. 
A somewhat philosophic view of the relationship of 
secondary school science to life affairs, and to society 
in general, notes that in the teaching of the elementary 
stages of science even as in the normal affairs of human 
life there is necessary: 
(1) A noting and grouping of existing conditions. 
This involves observations of the facts of any situation, 
and inferences as to the significance and relationships 
of these facts. 
(2) A formulation of a plan of action based on facts 
observed and inferred. This constitutes the working 
hypothesis of any course to be pursued. 
(3) Attempts to achieve desired results. This may 
involve repeated modifications of the original plan of 
procedure, and the testing out of any working hypothe- 
sis in its applications. : 
To a beginner in science studies starting points for 
sustained constructive thinking are found in various

personal experiences. What is known through experi- 
ence is concrete. On the other hand, whatever is un- 
familiar or not well understood may be considered edu- 
cationally abstract. Thinking to desired ends is un- 
likely when it does not originate in what is more or 
less well known, and when the attention is not concen- 
trated rather than distracted. To challenge the atten- 
tion of any learner, to arrest and hold it, often requires 
a repetition of his past experiences in some new as- 
pects, or in a somewhat more complex form. 
Class instruction may consist very largely in re- 
peated regroupings of former knowledge in connection 
with some few new facts. About something well un- 
derstood as a center are clustered life’s personal ex- 
periences, and any other information suitably related 
to the central fact. The applications, too, of what has 
been learned must be in the realm of the “known.” 
In the secondary school sciences such aims as the 
above may well constitute a dominating purpose of 
the teaching process. This differentiates the work 
sharply from college science where the aim is likely to 
be mastery of any subject as science. With college 
students there is supposed to be sufficient intellectual 
development to comprehend facts largely foreign to 
personal experiences. The theoretical in knowledge is 
presented to them as students more or less deductively. 
The college professor of any science is more concerned 
over a presentation of his subject to his students in a 
scientific way than with keeping them “interested” in 
83

it, or with so shaping his requirements as to establish 
studious habits. It is a more advanced stage of sci- 
ence instruction given to more mature people, and cer- 
tain preparations and fitness for this work may safely 
be presupposed. The formal lecture of the college 
classroom, and deductive reasoning concerning the the- 
oretical and mathematical in science, are both out of 
place with high school boys and girls, however fluent 
and well-prepared in these respects the science teacher 
as a recent college graduate may be. Inductive teach- 
ing as a characteristic of the initial stages of every 
new topic taken up in a high school science adds fact 
to fact, and relationship to relationship, resulting in 
the formation of more and more complex groupings as 
the mastery of a science in its elementary stages pro- 
ceeds. More rapid progress becomes in time, however, 
both desirable and possible, and in the secondary school 
the substitution of deductive for inductive procedure 
should become marked towards the conclusion of any 
science course. Deductive science teaching in high 
schools may very suitably be characterized as informa- 
tional, and inductive teaching as inspirational.

  CHAPTER Ix 
EXAMINATIONS IN SCIENCE TEACHING AS TESTS OF 
PROGRESS AND PROFICIENCY 
(A) Mental Tests in General 
With the various mental tests employed for promo- 
tion of pupils in the administration of public schools 
science teachers as such have little immediate concern. 
The science subjects are distributed more with refer- 
ence to one another than to other subjects taken in 
the same grade. The classes which come to a science 
instructor have in general had their fitness determined 
otherwise than by abilities of individual pupils to take 
the particular science subject of the grade to which 
they have been assigned. Grading throughout the ele- 
mentary schools, and very largely in secondary schools, 
is and must remain a horizontal stratification. It is 
not determined by completion of the units in series of 
any of the fields of education such as science, history, 
and mathematics. Because of these conditions the sci- 
ence teacher takes pupils whose ability in reading, 
writing, spelling, and calculations puts them fairly 
abreast of one another, and whose stages of progress 
in history, English, and language are fairly equal. For 
86
-P-A-G-E-99
EXAMINATIONS IN SCIENCE TEACHING 
dnstructional ends in general these groupings serve their 
purposes well enough, and may be as good as any for 
the science teacher. Further adjustments occur by 
reason of “science electives” whereby in many schools 
pupils for one reason or another, and perchance for 
no good reason at all, choose more or less advisedly 
which of certain science subjects shall be pursued. Of 
necessity such conditions as have been noted ignore 
completely any and all native ability in pupils for 
science studies, and any previous acquaintanceship 
with natural phenomena in both the physical and 
biological fields. 
The science teacher from the beginning of every 
course seeks to adapt his teachings to pupils under in- 
struction insofar as this can be done, rather than at- 
tempt to make them conform rigidly to “standardized” 
procedures in choices of subject matter, and in its man- 
ner of presentation. Especially is this the case in ele- 
mentary science course} So, in order to get a suitable 
understanding of his p&rticular “teaching problem,” 
very early in the course and even at its outset use can 
profitably be made of a “Range of Information Test” 1 
covering possibly the whole field of elementary science, 
or any particular portion of it as desired. “These tests 
can be prepared by an instructor himself, taking into 
account his teaching experiences and his knowledge of 
conditions to which his teaching must conform; or, 
purchase and use of standardized tests may profitably

be employed. A basic list of terms such as given in 
Appendix C may be used either as a whole, or it may 
be taken at different times in parts either by subjects 
or otherwise. Some suggestions promotive of efficiency 
in their use are noted in connection with the list given. 
Substitutions of terms in the list may be made at any 
time as desired. At all times it is to be kept in mind 
that the chief end in view is to ascertain into what 
sort of background of science knowledge the instruction 
to be given must be fitted, both for the class as a whole 
and for its individual members. Coming early in the 
course as such tests should, there is much in the way 
of enlightenment in their results for both teacher and 
pupils. To the pupil it is a survey of the field of 
instruction into which he is to enter while as yet no 
responsibilities by reason of laxity in efforts may be 
charged up against him. It provides somewhat of a 
notion of the effort to be required of him even from 
the very first of the course. To the instructor infor- 
mation is furnished concerning which of his pupils are 
likely to need special helpfulness and consideration, 
and of which pupils much should be demanded from 
the beginning of the course. 
(B) Examinations for Proficiency 
Elsewhere (p. 116) brief mention is made of pur- 
poses of examinations in the general scheme of school 
instruction. “Science teachers even as instructors in 
other fields of education must employ examinations, 
88  
-P-A-G-E-101
    
EXAMINATIONS IN SCIENCE TEACHING 
"written quizzes, and various tests, but always as means 
to an end and not as ends in themselves. Certain char- 
acteristics of examination lists, and some precautions 
to be observed in examinations, may be discussed here 
to advantage. As a basis for grades and promotions 
no teacher can with security to himself discard exam- 
inations, nor substitute therefor personal estimates 
of fitness. Neither can an instructor be fully assured 
that the relative merits of work done by pupils under 
his instruction are evaluated with justice to all in ab- 
sence of some suitable written class tests. ~A succes- 
sion of tests as progress is made in a course marks off 
stages of advancement which in the eyes of pupils is 
quite a matter of importance. 
That the integrity of examination results may be 
maintained, and that pupils of honest intent be not 
penalized for their honesty, precautions must be taken 
at examination times of such nature that as a matter 
of course cheating is unlikely. Such precautions may 
require small classes, or subdivisions of classes with 
vacant seats separating pupils, but no large amount 
of administrative ability or added labor for the in- 
structor is necessarily involved. No pains is too great 
to avoid impeaching the integrity of examination re- 
sults, and lowering the standards of honesty in all 
things. Where any act is considered “all right if you 
can get away with it,” and in school life this is applic- 
able to grades and promotions no matter how attained, 
there need be no wonderment over lawlessness on the

TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
part of generations trained to ignore the nice dis- 
tinctions between things right and things wrong. On 
every hand are to be noted risks taken with expecta- 
tion of not being caught, and these not only in finan- 
cial transactions but as well in social and civic rela- 
tionships generally. That there be in evidence any 
system of espionage, or any prominence given to prep- 
arations of any sort to “catch” cases of dishonesty, is 
in itself prima facie evidence of poor psychology on 
the part of a teacher, and of a serious lack of knowl- 
edge of human nature. Better eliminate examinations 
than make them a means for training in deception and 
dishonesty, and the occasion of loss of confidence on the 
part of pupils in their fellows. This is of course no 
more true for science teachers than for others. 
As previously suggested the teacher of science sub- 
jects is likely to be free very largely of the Intelligence 
Tests so much in evidence in school work to-day. ‘But 
Achievement Tests * as outgrowths of the instructor’s 
own experiences, or employed as standardized tests, 
aid science teachers in maintaining year after year 
some degree of uniformity of teaching results with suc- 
cessive classes. Coming as these tests do at the con- 
clusion of a topic, or of some division of a subject, their 
instructional values may be small. In nature they are 
much the same as semester “finals,” but to them at-

taches none of the risks of failure or success which too 
often taint with a gambler’s risk the “final exams” of 
high schools even as in colleges. For the teacher these 
results have much that is enlightening concerning 
teaching values attained, and much which provokes to 
efforts for better teaching. 
(C) Some Suggestions 
Suggestions of details pertaining to examinations, 
as well as some general principles to be followed in 
connection with holding examinations, are permissible 
here as an aid to teachers who are lacking in experi- 
ence. In time instructors modify procedures to suit 
their own experiences and preferences. What is out- 
lined is by way of suggestion only: 
I. Plan to have examinations upon the completion of 
every major division of a subject. Let the question list 
be restricted to such section. Averages of the results 
of these examinations can be used as a basis for grades 
of pupils. “Final examinations” thus become unnec- 
essary save for those pupils whose ranking is other- 
wise a matter of uncertainty. 
Where a pupil is reported “Failed,” there is ever 
the possibility that the teacher’s grading may be chal- 
lenged by the pupil or by his parents. In such cases 
it may be wise to have recourse to an examination cov- 
ering the entire semester’s course. This list of ques- 
tions always fair but searching may be of the teacher’s 
91
-P-A-G-E-104
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
own selection. Under some circumstances, it may be 
better to use some standardized achievement test. 
From an instructional standpoint there is little value 
in any such test, and the results may in nowise change 
opinions previously held. In other respects it is a mat- 
ter of much importance in its bearing upon the pro- 
fessional standing of a teacher. 
II. Question lists should include in ever-varying pro- 
portions such requirements as: 
(a) Questions testing memorization of what has 
been taught in class and of what has been study in 
textbook of the meaning of which there could have 
been no misunderstanding. 
(b) Questions which test ability to make applica- 
tions of what has been taught, but teachings now pre- 
sented in some new relationship preferably more or less 
familiar in life affairs. 
(c) Some one question at least, possibly one out of 
eleven questions where but ten must be answered, 
pertinent and fair but likely to be beyond the ability 
of the less capable pupils of the class, illustrative of 
the fact that all has not yet been learned about the 
subject. 
(d) Some problems which are not involved or es- 
pecially difficult, and questions calling for numerical 
answers of importance. 
(e) Description of some simple experiment, original 
or otherwise, illustrative of some teaching given. De- 
92
-P-A-G-E-105
EXAMINATIONS IN SCIENCE TEACHING 
scription or diagram of simple apparatus used or dis- 
cussed. 
(f) Write-up of observations for some brief demon- 
stration experiment performed before the class by the 
instructor, with a full explanation of what was 
observed. 
III. In framing questions to be asked keep in mind 
what are possible answers for every one of them. Seek 
to make the questions so clear and definite that but 
one correct answer in general is possible. Avoid use of 
language which may not be understood fully, Plan re- 
quirements so that grades of better students are likely 
to range 80-95 per cent. Then have question lists 
written out in advance, possibly on a portable slated- 
cloth blackboard; or, what is far better, hand out 
sheets of duplicate examination lists. Thought ques- 
tions rather than memory tests discourage “cramming,” 
and lessen likelihood of cheating. 
Special care should be taken where questions are put 
upon the blackboard that no pupil shall be handi- 
capped or penalized by inability to see and easily read 
every requirement. 
IV. Insist that papers handed in be legibly written 
whether in ink or pencil, and be in small-size well- 
formed letters, with least reasonable amount of paper 
used. Brevity in answering without sacrifice of defi- 
niteness and completeness is preferable to “much speak- 
ing.” Have name (and file number) on every sheet 
93 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
handed in. (Oftentimes by writing on both sides, one 
sheet only need be handed in.) 
V. Arrange seating so that likelihood (temptation) 
to copy, or to give or get aid, is eliminated so far as 
possible. Do not put conscientious pupils at a disad- 
vantage by toleration even of appearances of evil. 
Encourage honesty of purpose and spirit of fairness 
by being as a teacher ever fair and considerate. In 
all respects appear to take it for granted that every one 
is honest. So make arrangements that no issue is 
likely to arise between a pupil and the teacher from 
any questioning of motives. 
VI. In marking examination papers: 
(a) Careless or indifferent markings are intolerable. 
To the pupil these tests are of importance. 
(b) Upon each answer place the valuation given it 
as a separate answer. The sum of these values, di- 
vided by the total value had all answers been correct, 
gives a grade intelligible to the pupil. 
(c) Get the graded papers back to the pupils with- 
out any considerable delay. Let this be before an- 
swers become matters of indifference to pupils, and 
before opportunity passes for instruction concerning 
matters of misapprehension or lack of understanding 
on the part of the class as a whole. In cases of mani- 
fest error in marking, make changes in grade so.that 
no injustice may be done any pupil. Where in general 
the class as a whole fails in an examination it furnishes 
94
-P-A-G-E-107
EXAMINATIONS IN SCIENCE TEACHING 
occasion for an instructor to take heed to his own ways. 
Wide and unexpected differences in grades of pupils 
should occasion persistent but kindly inquiries as to 
causes of failure by any pupil. 
VII. The general purpose of the written quiz should 
never be lost sight of. It is a time of taking inventory 
of existing conditions, and “taking stock” of assets and 
liabilities, both for teacher and pupils. Efficiency in 
instructional processes in every way is promoted and 
perfected by use of examinations. 
VIII. In addition to their value for the teacher as 
tests of achievement by pupils, and as a check upon the 
efficiency of his teaching, these written tests have value 
in themselves. They furnish: 
(a) Opportunities to pupils to recall certain essentials 
of the topics under consideration, and thus fix these es- 
sentials in memory by reason of the repetitions required. 
(b) Proper notions of worth to pupils as to what 
are the essentials of that part of the subject. This 
assumes of course that the teacher is so well trained 
that he selects important parts for consideration in 
examination. Pupils soon learn whether or not they 
themselves have selected essentials when preparing 
for an examination. 
(c) Opportunity to make applications of what sup- 
posedly has been learned. The ability to do this is 
one of the most desirable products of science study. 
It can be gained as a result of frequent opportunities 
95

CHAPTER X 
WHAT IT IS TO STUDY IN HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCES 
School attendance implies study. Not least of the 
efforts of science teachers in secondary schools is so 
to shape their requirements, and carry on their work 
day by day, that the chief product of their labors shall 
be an acquired ability on the part of their pupils to 
apply themselves as students to any and all of life’s 
problems. 
Organized school systems despite their perfection and 
all their outlays really count for little educationally 
when teachers through whom as individuals the sup- 
posed advantages of schools are to accrue to pupils 
have neither a vision of purposes nor a concern for 
possibilities in school training; when they remain 
blindly indifferent concerning sustained efforts for 
growth of pupils in ability to think. 
For the sake of perspective it is well at times to con- 
sider how the problems peculiar to the schoolroom ap- 
pear when viewed from without, and in relation to life 
affairs as a whole. How shall the purposes, the pro- 
cedure, and the accomplishments of the science teacher 
have any bearing on the ability of one who later in life 
as a business or professional man, farmer, or home- 
97 
   
-P-A-G-E-110
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
maker must study and solve the “problems” of life? 
What is it to establish through the work of classroom 
and laboratory that attitude of a student, and that ac- 
tivity in studious practices, directly affecting the pro- 
cedure of a lawyer as he studies the case of any client? 
In the latter instance from the client himself, and 
from all other available sources of information—wit- 
nesses, personal investigations, books of law, court de- 
cisions, community interests—a lawyer seeks first to 
get all “facts” bearing upon the case. As these facts 
are being accumulated their various relationships are 
noted. Those facts not vital to the case at issue are 
ignored. Where necessary information is lacking, fur- 
ther efforts are made to acquire it. Full consideration 
of the facts and their significance makes possible a 
“working hypothesis” which is of the nature of a con- 
clusion as to what is best to do under the circumstances. 
Then follows the application or trial of this plan in 
court before judge or jury. It not infrequently hap- 
pens in these trials that evidence heretofore unknown 
is introduced rendering necessary an entire remaking of 
the plan of presentation previously settled upon. It 
is as when a scientist learns of facts, newly discovered 
it may be, affecting theories before entertained and 
taught by him, and the facts are not in accord with the 
theories. So soon as it is definitely established just 
what this new information is, and what bearing it has 
‘on the theories held, the theories must be recast. 
Where opinions, beliefs, or plans do not accord with 
98
-P-A-G-E-111
  WHAT IT IS TO STUDY IN HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCES 
facts, the facts prevail. And it is a distinguishing 
characteristic of a student, as it is of a scientist, to pos- 
sess the ability to review and regroup all significant 
facts in any case, and to reach new conclusions which 
when application is made of them shall accord with the 
facts. 
The trained mind is superior to the material by 
means of which it acquired its training. To be able 
to group and organize the facts gained from experience 
and experiment, from the statements of text and ref- 
erence books, and from teachers and other people, in- 
volves%tudy training. Though always best attained, 
perhaps, as incidental to the routine of the usual school 
procedure, its attainment need be neither haphazard 
nor problematical. On the other hand, it can scarcely 
be expected to be other than variable in degree with 
different pupils even when they are held to the same 
requirements. Possibly in many cases there may be 
little progress apparent. Some pupils will develop 
studious ways under unfavorable teaching conditions, 
learning how to study unaided by schools and in spite 
of schools. Any training in schools to make students 
out of pupils demands of teachers a clear understanding 
of what it means to study, and a procedure both con- 
sistent and persistent. Science subjects may be so 
presented that topic by topic they are of the nature 
of a series of “problems” the chief end of which is not 
so much a mastery of the facts in the case as it is the 
establishment of habits of effective study—not so much

grades and graduation as it is pupils who know how 
to study, and who habitually have the attitude of stu- 
dents in any of the affairs of life. Classrooms and lab- 
oratories are study rooms. In this conception of teach- 
ing the out-of-school experiences of pupils are funda- 
mental both in the initiation and in the conclusion of 
school studies. 
To the physician every patient presents a “problem” 
the solution for which lies largely in a correct diagnosis 
of the case. This involves both extended observation 
and correct inferences. In the treatment prescribed 
there must ever be the need to take notice if it fits 
the needs of the patient, thus involving it may be a 
possible review of the facts of the case and a more ex- 
tended knowledge of it, together with the formulation 
of a suppléfental diagnosis with its consequent 
changes in treatment. The successful business man in 
his extended operations must take exact account of all 
the “facts” bearing upon his enterprises, and what 
these facts signify in relation to the various problems 
that come before him demanding wise action and the 
fewest possible mistakes in business. The efficient 
housewife as a successful household administrator must 
be competent in reaching and when necessary of re- 
viewing decisions which on the one hand are based upon 
facts affecting the affairs of the household, and which 
upon the other constitute the working plans upon the 
successful execution of which the welfare of family 
life depends. Upon the variable facts of weather and 
100
-P-A-G-E-113
  WHAT IT IS TO STUDY IN HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCES 
soil conditions, the farmer must be able to base deci- 
sions that will “work out” when application is made of 
them. He, too, must be competent to revise his plans 
in accord with changing conditions, and make his pro- 
cedure fit the conditions. 
Indeed, in all these aspects of life and the various 
others of which these are but types, are to be seen in 
varying degree and varied form the procedure and the 
attitude of the scientist in his labors and his investi- 
gations. The “scientific attitude” and the “scientific 
procedure” are not only fundamental to advances in 
human knowledge, but they constitute the mental 
states and working processes natural to effective ser- 
vice in all the walks of life. The ways of study in 
schools should be wisely ordered first steps in becom- 
ing competent students in life’s affairs. Study in school 
is in its adaptations and uses of subject matter but a 
more or less varied round of perfecting one’s self in 
a routine characteristically scientific. 
This presupposes, then, a procedure in the science 
teaching of secondary schools which constitutes a train- 
ing whose chief product is students. It seeks the 
formation of those “habits of study” which find their 
perfection in the later and continued out-of-school 
studies. The purpose in such a training scheme of 
manuals and texts and reference books, of the class- 
room and the teacher, are discussed in the chapters de- 
voted to those topics. It is unlikely in this connection 
that too much emphasis will be placed on the need of 
101
-P-A-G-E-114
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
clear conceptions on the part of the teacher that the 
“study habit, and those mental habits conducive to 
study, are gained through use of the subject matter 
of the sciences, and not as abstractions from it. Suc- 
cess in this as in other teaching efforts is likely to come 
in largest measure as a result of wise planning and 
persistent efforts. 
One of the best methods of acquiring a clear notion 
of what it is to really study is to analyze the action of 
one who is a successful investigator in any field of 
scientific effort. Not infrequently is it true that such 
men may at times utterly neglect the need for food and 
rest through long periods of time so intent do they be- 
come in accomplishing what they have undertaken as a 
“problem” to be solved. Anyone who would be a 
student must be in earnest in whatever is undertaken, 
concentrating all his energies upon the task at hand 
whether laboratory work, text or reference book work, 
or any other activity in the learning process. 
Another point to note in the conduct of the research 
worker in science is his almost uncanny keenness of 
discriminating concerning the things within the field 
of science which are of primary importance. He has a 
well-developed ability for picking out whatever in any 
problem relating to scientific aspects of life is of prim-

whatever is not essential. A beginner in science 
courses cannot be expected to start out in his new

work with any such capabilities. Here are opportuni- 
ties for teachers to render services which are more of 
the nature of training than of instruction. No incon- 
siderable part of the plans and purposes of science 
teachers should be in this field of effort. Not only in 
class time by giving it formal attention, but as well 
in periods of laboratory work and of supervised study, 
pupils are to be exercised in gathering information and 
in making relationships of facts, and in intelligent dis- 
crimination as to the relative importance of these facts 
to the problem under consideration. 
College students preparing to be teachers are sup- 
posedly able to analyze the teaching procedure of their 
instructors in a subjective way, and to profit greatly as 
prospective teachers from objective presentations of 
science teachings. High school pupils as a rule cannot 
be expected to do this, and formal training is needed 
that they may become capable students, knowing how 
to study and how to do it most profitably. 
The rate of accomplishment as it measures the study 
power of students who are in earnest, and who know 
how to make choices of the essentials in thought mate- 
rial, is so markedly in contrast to what is done by those 
who have never learned how to study that it is well 
to point out these differences to high school pupils, 
emphasizing especially the folly of their taking so 
much time to accomplish so little. Attempts to im- 
prove methods of study may at times be urged on the 
103
-P-A-G-E-116
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
ground that the better students frequently have more 
time for other things due to the economy of time which 
goes with correct habits of study. 
Another trait of the successful student is an almost 
intuitive grasp of the relationships of things. He does 
not waste time trying to memorize disconnected data. 
He appears to learn and seems to retain information 
with but little conscious effort not only because he is 
interested in what he is doing, but because he makes 
associations of the right ideas as he proceeds. Rela- 
tionships between newly acquired thought material, as 
well as between what is new and what had been previ- 
ously learned, are quickly noted and firmly established 
in mind. There is thus built up a body of knowledge 
which is usable because the bearing of each part of it 
upon every other part is comprehended. The student, 
as well as any one in the daily walks of life who has 
acquired habits of study such as these, will not lack 
initiative. As a rule, he notes quickly what should be 
done on any occasion, selects from his well-ordered 
store of knowledge that which applies to the case in 
hand, and confidently applies his knowledge to the ac- 
complishment of his aims and purposes. 
Since necessarily much in the way of moral in- 
struction devolves upon the teacher, it is well at times 
to point out to pupils that only by use of their natural 
abilities to their fullest extent, are the requirements of 
their moral natures satisfied. \Of those who are brighter

a natural endowment in the make-up of individuals. 
Its most complete development is a duty naturally de- 
volving upon an individual. He who fails to make the 
most of his abilities, mental as well as otherwise, fails 
in obligations to himself and to others. His course is 
wrong rather than right. Of everyone is demanded the 
best of which he is capable, and no more is demanded 
of any one than he is able to do.

  CHAPTER XI 
THE TEACHING “CYCLE” IN SECONDARY SCHOOL SCIENCES 
In theory teachers of secondary school science must 
be left largely free in making choices of subject matter, 
and in ways of presenting it. This is necessary in order 
that the teacher may adapt his work to teaching con- 
ditions. It presumes a resourceful and qualified 
teacher who has sufficient time and initiative to adapt 
means at hand to ends sought. Very commonly, how- 
ever, science teachers are likely to follow the presenta- 
tion of some text or manual, despite the fact that a too 
strict adherence to the requirements of one or the 
other is fatal to the best teaching. On the other hand, 
any go-as-you-please procedure, with no two science 
teachers following the same plan in the same subject, is 
inconsistent with claims made in behalf of the sci- 
ences. Save in case of a few master teachers such lack 
of systematic procedure inevitably involves educational 
waste. 
So far as organization of knowledge is concerned, it 
can be assumed that the mental activities of high 
school pupils are in the main illogical and non-scien- 
tific. Teaching efficiency requires of an instructor and 
of his pupils a teaching round, or “cycle,” which is 
107
-P-A-G-E-120
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
pedagogical rather than scientific, and which is not 
necessarily in accord with scientific classifications of 
the subject matter under consideration. Primarily it 
is children who are to be taught rather than any sci- 
ence. In its elementary stages the subject matter of 
the sciences should be presented according to the needs 
of those under instruction. Classification of knowledge 
in accordance with the theories of science is of a later 
stage, though the procedure in acquiring facts and in 
interpreting them must ever be scientific from the 
outset. 
The larger needs of pupils, those which are to dom- 
inate the teaching situation in any science subject, 
may be summarized for our purposes here as follows: 
(1) Arousing of interest, and stimulation and guid- 
ance of a desire to know what is to be presented. 
(2) Growth in the belief of pupils that what is be- 
ing taught them is quite worth while. 
(3) Marshaling by the teacher of the concrete? 
things of the life experiences of pupils in the particular 
field of science being studied, together with whatever 
has been learned from wisely chosen experimental ex- 
ercises in school. 
(4) A presentation of the theoretical side of the sci- 
ence in order that the grouping of facts learned may go 
on in accordance with such theories.

108
-P-A-G-E-121
  
TEACHING “CYCLE” IN SECONDARY SCHOOL SCIENCES 
tribute to the teaching of secondary school scienees 
insofar as they train the pupils in methods of observa- 
tion and inference. Within narrow limits there should 
be established by such courses attitudes of mind and 
manner of thought directly serviceable in all later 
studies of the differentiated high school sciences. 
There should be carried over from these elementary 
courses to this later work the use of introductory dis- 
cussions in connection with the more important new 
topics. These discussions may be made to center in 
questions pertaining to the topic of the hour. They 
should involve many facts with which the pupils are 
acquainted by reason of their life experiences. This 
knowledge of life affairs and of life interests, though 
lacking in organization and in an understanding of its 
full significance, is an asset of largest educational worth 
in quickly securing from the pupils an alert respon- 
sive mental attitude, and in making available for im- 
mediate use a large fund of information capable of be- 
ing organized in accordance with scientific procedure. 
The fact that sounds of blows of a hammer as 
watched from a distance, and the whistling of a dis- 
tant locomotive, are not heard till some time after the 
occasion for the sound has been noted by sight may be 
a common-place in the experience of childhood. No 
inquiry may ever have been provoked as to causes of 
these delays in hearing. But in teaching the nature of 
sound, its velocity, etc., this previously acquired in- 
formation becomes at once of greatest worth in shap- 
109 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
ing problems for the purpose of directing thought ef- 
fort, and for use in the verification of general teach- 
ings regarding sound. Simple experiments performed 
by an instructor in connection with any questions 
asked may when suitably chosen not only introduce 
new knowledge to pupils, but serve as centers for in- 
struction about which to group what is already known 
in relationships characteristically scientific. Both ex- 
periments and questions, whether wholly original or 
used from some manual, keep in the hands of an in- 
structor the necessary control and guidance of discus- 
sions whereby desired teaching ends are best attained. 
However much or however little of time and origi- 
nality high school science teachers in general may have, 
ny laboratory manual should render a real service to 
the many teachers who do need assistance by provid- 
ing a well-digested list of questions based upon life ex- 
periences assumed to be common to the pupils taking 
the course. This question list may be complete in it- 
self, or it may be merely suggestive of a complete series. 
It may include, or it may only suggest, experiments 
to be performed by the teacher the purpose of which 
shall be (1) to give significance to the new matter 
upon which instruction is to be given; (2) to stimulate 
and sustain a mental attitude receptive of instruction; 
(8) to furnish centers about which to group instruc- 
tion; (4) to make clear the scientific relationships and 
procedure in experimental work, and in its interpre- 
tation. 
110  
-P-A-G-E-123
  TEACHING “CYCLE” IN SECONDARY SCHOOL SCIENCES 
“All this leaves the teacher free to adapt or to orig- 
inate requirements necessary for special or unusual 
teaching conditions. Both the questions and the ex- 
periments seek first of all a mental condition—a “class- 
mind’—which shall furnish to a well-prepared in- 
structor the opportunity prerequisite to the most ef- 
fective sort of teaching. 
And it is at this stage of teaching that carefully se- 
lected reference readings may be used by pupils to 
excellent purpose for the enrichment of the course, and 
for giving it a desired flexibility. It is an excellent plan 
where funds permit, to have several copies each of care- 
fully chosen reference books upon every science sub- 
ject taught at all times available in the science rooms. 
These should be texts other than the book adopted for 
regular use. A different viewpoint, or a different way 
of presenting a given topic, may thus be gained. Some- 
times things that are difficult to grasp are taught in a 
masterly way by a particular author whose book on 
the whole may not be well suited for use as a regular 
text. If a half dozen copies of such a book can be ob- 
tained and kept at hand, pupils may be referred to 
certain sections of it at the proper time to good advan- 
tage. A supply of such supplementary texts often- 
times may be had through dealers in second-hand 
books. Again, the textbook in regular use—say in 
chemistry—may devote relatively little space to de- 
scriptive matter, dwelling more largely on fundamental 
principles and theory. In such cases copies of a good 
111
-P-A-G-E-124
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
college text for the more capable pupils may be de- 
sirable. Even a limited use of these books keeps 
pupils profitably occupied when ahead of their class- 
mates. 
If at first definite assistance be given pupils in the 
selection of suitable reference books, and in the use 
of index and table of contents, they develop ability to 
select and use reference books for themselves to good 
purpose. Through such training they become skilled 
in the art of study. Reprints of original papers on 
epoch-making discoveries are very valuable reference 
books. Through their use can be interwoven some of 
the historical aspects of the science. It is seldom that 
one finds in a modern high school text so clear-cut an 
exposition of the important theories of science as was 
originally given by the author of the theory. Avo- 
gadro’s Hypothesis, as an example, was better ex- 
pressed by Avogadro himself than by later. authors. 
The setting, too, of the great discoveries, and the form- 
ulation of hypotheses based upon them, is often best 
given in the original papers.? Use in connection with 
these references of any foreign language of which pupils 
may have a reading knowledge is to be encouraged 
since it gives valuable correlation of science and lan- 
guage studies. Oftentimes reports on references very 
properly may be required of the more ambitious in the 
class, and of those who as naturally rapid workers are

Les Classiques de la Science (Librairie Armand Colin: Paris) are 
invaluable. 
112
-P-A-G-E-125
  TEACHING “CYCLE” IN SECONDARY SCHOOL SCIENCES 
likely to have spare time in the laboratory hour. For- 
tunately there are on the publishers’ lists not a few 
suitable books which present many phases of scientific 
achievement in a sufficiently complete and accurate 
form, and with a style and a freedom from technical 
terms to make them attractive to high school pupils.’ 
One or two such books as part of the laboratory equip- 
ment are preferable to a library full of books which 
lack in attractiveness for boys and girls. 
In all secondary school sciences laboratory manuals 
of a high grade of excellence are already on the market 
either to accompany some special text, or for use with 
any text. In these manuals the discriminating science 
teacher can find desirable sets of experiments for use 
by the pupils. Quite uniformly the facts which these 
experiments bring to the attention of the pupils, the 
discrimination required as to the relative worth of these 
facts, and the scientific relationships readily discerned 
among them, leaves very little to be desired. 
Probably there is no substitute for the requirement 
that the results of laboratory exercises such as observa- 
tions, inferences, drawings, mathematical calculations, 
etc., be written out and handed in for correction and 
credit, or for inspection at the pupil’s desk by the in- 
structor. The pedagogical value of this written work as 
discussed elsewhere (pp. 27-34) involves on the pupil’s 
part concise statements of his thought relationships. 
His attention at these times is called to whatever he 
*Such as Creative Chemistry: Slosson. (Century Co.) 
113
-P-A-G-E-126
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
lacks in comprehension of the subject matter discussed. 
The free use of texts and other books as sources of in- 
formation when a need for information has become 
painfully apparent to pupils in writing their laboratory 
papers furnishes conditions quite ideal for a study hour. 
It is favorable in the highest degree for training pupils 
to be students in the true sense of that term. Like the 
“Sieur Brun,” who according to Jean Rey,‘ was filled 
“with astonishment, and with a desire to know whence 
the surplus weight had come,” pupils will frequently 
encounter something in their laboratory work to really 
interest them, arousing this desire to know. These are 
times when educationally it is well to “strike while 
the iron is hot.” Through the use of books in this way 
as sources of information and as means of enlighten- 
ment, in due time there is acquired an ability to find 
desired information expeditiously and unerringly so 
far as library facilities at hand permit. 
It is believed, too, that certain question lists should 
be a feature of laboratory manuals even as we are 
accustomed to the exercises found generally in science 
texts. Their differentiation from questions used to in- 
troduce studies of a topic, and from the questions in 
the text, are matters of teaching purpose rather than 
of form and content. In these lists there should be 
(1) some leading questions to suggest what are the 
purposes of various experiments, and at certain points

Calcined.” (See “Alembic Club” Reprint.) 
114
-P-A-G-E-127
  TEACHING “CYCLE” IN SECONDARY SCHOOL SCIENCES 
of any experiment why a certain procedure is followed; 
(2) a review of some of the more important facts of 
the laboratory exercises and of the introductory dis- 
cussions, especially such as are likely to enter into the 
constructive thinking demanded in the next succeeding 
teaching assignments; (3) certain thought-provoking 
requirements of the nature of “problems” in order to 
sustain and. direct interest, and to promote a spirit of 
inquiry; (4) a demand for enough use of the text so 
that its content as taken up topic by topic becomes 
somewhat familiar, thus anticipating and making easier 
the later task of mastering the text matter as a whole. 
With the use of a text later by pupils during the 
write-up of laboratory exercises, and again as a source 
of the information required by the question lists, the 
purpose of any further assignments of lessons in the 
text will then be narrowed (1) to the rounding out 
and completion of discussions of each topic in turn; (2) 
to furnishing material for a quiz for which pupils are 
required to master everything which the book gives 
upon any topic as a whole, or upon certain selected 
portions of it. Teaching experience warrants the use 
of text matter as an effective means of exerting pres- 
sure upon pupils for that sustained effort which is in- 
volved in the forced mental activities of school days. 
Ability to repeat words and interpret book statements 
must ever remain a ready means with successive gen- 
erations of youth for gauging the preparation of 
lessons. 
115  
-P-A-G-E-128
    TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
In this teaching cycle there remains only to mention 
that necessary evil the formal written “examination,” 
for which there is no satisfactory substitute (1) as a 
basis for grades and for promotions in school life; 
(2) as a suitable stimulus to which the teacher from 
time to time may resort as pupils weary and relax in 
reasonable degrees of effort in their school tasks. To 
approximate a certain irreducible minimum of the 
evils of examination, and a maximum of their teaching 
values when used as the last of the teaching stages of 
any topic or series of topics, involves certain precau- 
tions and purposes (pp. 86-96), but no “problem” of 
major importance. 
In connection with a summary of these teaching 
stages it is to be remarked that while distinct purposes 
are assigned to each such stage, any unchanging ad- 
herence to their order in teaching procedure, and any 
uniformity of emphasis placed upon these several 
stages, will destroy the spirit and defeat the purpose 
of their differentiation. The different topics of all 
secondary school sciences require a varied treatment 
for the sake of variety itself, and for a maximum of 
teachmg value. But this in nowise lessens a demand 
for that teaching efficiency which is best attained 
through judicious use of some such procedure as set 
forth in “A Cycle of Science Teaching” which follows. 
It enables an instructor at all times to be conscious of 
the immediate teaching end of the day’s plan, and in 
what stage of a well-defined cycle of teaching the day’s 
116
-P-A-G-E-129
  TEACHING “CYCLE” IN SECONDARY SCHOOL SCIENCES 
work lies. Unity in purpose rather than in method is 
sought. However constant may be the subject matter 
of a course, the laboratory equipment and supplies, 
and the community interests and influences, the 
teacher and pupils are ever-changing factors in the 
teaching problem, and diversity in teaching procedure 
becomes inevitable in secondary school sciences. Then, 
too, while following such a “cycle” in teaching in order 
that monotony in class work may be avoided, and that 
the teacher himself continue to grow and be keen in his 
teaching, it is desirable and even necessary to vary 
continuously the manner of instruction, possibly the 
order of topics, and certainly the illustrations used and 
the applications made of the work. 
Even the traditional arbitrary division of time into 
class and laboratory work does violence to educational 
processes even while it serves the ends of school ad- 
ministration. Where a certain amount of time daily 
has been set apart for a science subject, choice of a 
particular phase of the teaching cycle for any stated 
day or hour should be made solely with reference to 
what has largest educational value to the pupils in 
their particular stage of work. Indeed, the teacher 
should be wholly free within the limitations of the 
curriculum to change from any one teaching phase to 
another at will, and the order of steps set forth below 
should be modified or, it may be, wholly disregarded 
from time to time as conditions more or less unusual 
may require. 
117
-P-A-G-E-130
TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
A Cycle of Science Teaching 
1. A Class Period of Introductory Discussion: 
(a) Assembling as class knowledge what pupils al- 
ready know as individuals. Its use so far as this knowl- 
edge is usable in a study of the topic under considera- 
tion. Enrichment of such first-hand knowledge with 
further information imparted by the instructor in order 
to group and organize all of it according to its scien- 
tific relationships. 
(b) Simple experiments performed by the teacher 
to serve as centers of new groupings of knowledge. 
The use by the instructor of inductive laboratory exer- 
cises, experimental and otherwise, to afford opportuni- 
ties for constructive thought guidance. 
(This necessitates an extensive acquaintanceship 
on the part of a teacher with the many phases of 
elementary science. A review of any work of previous 
lessons finds place here as an introduction to the new 
lesson). 
2. Laboratory Exercises: 
(a) These exercises must be such as to provide those 
particular experiences as “observations” wherewith to 
interpret what is to be brought before the pupils in the 
text as new knowledge, and for which the introductory 
discussions have prepared the way. 
(b) Whether these experiments are to be performed

              TEACHING “CYCLE” IN SECONDARY SCHOOL SCIENCES 
by pupils or by teacher will depend upon the subject, 
the nature of the experiments, the advancement of the 
pupils in science studies, the equipment, and other 
teaching conditions. 
(c) Whether class discussions of experiments involv- 
ing observations, inferences, conclusions, and applica- 
tions in terms of the science studied shall accompany 
the experimental work, or wait its completion and 
write-up, will likewise depend upon teaching condi- 
tions. 
(d) Laboratory exercises certainly should not con- 
sist exclusively of experiments. Very often there may 
be sets of questions to be answered sometimes,orally 
and sometimes in/ writing, together with/ drawings, 
topical descriptions, and various kinds of mathematical 
and quantitative work. Excursions to industrial 
plants, to municipal or public utility enterprises, may 
be considered a part of the laboratory experiences. 
3. A Study Period: 
(a) Includes time spent in the laboratory in writing 
answers to laboratory exercises, both experiments and 
question lists. These questions should anticipate dif- 
ficulties likely to be experienced later in preparation 
for a text quiz. A discriminating use of books becomes 
necessary im this search for information of a specific 
character. This is the time of all times to gratify de- 
sires of pupils for knowledge which is definite and 
119
-P-A-G-E-132
    TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
complete. Under guidance of the instructor there be- 
comes possible a training of pupils in ways truly scien- 
tific in acquiring knowledge. 
(b) Free use of text and other reference books al- 
lowed pupils during the write-up period provides 
needed assistance in vocabulary, in suitable expres- 
sion of scientific facts, and for acquiring a scientific 
viewpoint of any problem under consideration. The 
text in its use here is a friend in need to the pupil and 
serves to supplement but never to supplant what the 
teacher can do. 
(c) These laboratory papers after correction by the 
teacher, and when returned to the pupils, make up in 
large part the content of the notebooks. This com- 
bined use of reference books and experimental exercises 
is far more productive of educational advancement 
than is their separate and more or less unrelated use. 
4. Questions for Thought and Reference: 
(a) These are to be answered orally or in writing 
as their nature and teaching conditions shall dictate. 
Simple mathematical calculations as applications of 
instruction given are included, together with drawings 
and brief topical discussions. 
(b) Some of the chief ends attained in use of these 
exercises are a training in acquiring facts. (largely as 
information from books), and the organization of this 
information into definite, concise, balanced statements 
and discussions. This leaves for a later quiz on the

text only the parts which lend themselves best to a 
rapid-fire, question-and-answer exercise. (Use of the 
text here for recitation, and in preparing questions for 
thought and reference, may be outside the school room 
when teaching conditions seem to make it necessary.) 
&. Quiz on Text Assignment: 
Oral examination on an assigned limited portion of 
the text, ample opportunity for its mastery having 
been given. Or, a written examination to complete the 
consideration of several selected topics forming a unit 
of the subject studied.

CHAPTER XII 
THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
Aside from an aptitude and initiative and skill de- 
sirable in all teachers, and quite apart from all require- 
ments of a scholastic and professional preparation or 
of a disclipinary and administrative character, a 
peculiar fitness and competency is demanded for suc- 
cess in science teaching in secondary schools. In 
the smaller high schools where the several science 
branches are all taught by one person, handicapped as 
such teachers often are by lack of suitable rooms, fur- 
nishings and equipment, the capable science teacher 
eager to accomplish for his pupils the educational pos- 
sibilities of his subjects is likely to be the most over- 
loaded member of the teaching force. In schools suf- 
ficiently large to employ a teacher for every science 
branch offered, or where the various sciences are par- 
celled out among the different teachers, the demands 
upon time and strength are commonly less exacting. 
On the other hand, in large high schools the many large 
classes require of the“science teacher great administra- 
tive ability in order to give any individual attention 
to his pupils. 
With a skilled teacher of large “executive ability, 
125  
-P-A-G-E-138
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
aided it may be by services from pupil assistants, there 
should be a large increase in teaching effectiveness by 
having instruction in several science branches given 
by the same instructor. Despite a possible tendency 
on the part of such a teacher to over emphasize one 
science at the expense of others, this arrangement in 
the smaller secondary schools is conducive to efficiency 
in the science work as a whole. Where one teacher 
trains a pupil in each of the several related sciences he 
can avoid too much duplication of work, and can 
readily provide abundance of opportunities for pupils 
to apply in one science what has been learned in an- 
other. Thus, for example, the gas laws of Boyle and 
of Charles learned in physics are applied in chemistry 
to the correction of gas volumes. If the teacher is a 
master of these sciences, he can give pupils something 
of their relationships in principles and in applications. 
Instead of giving isolated glimpses of this or that arti- 
ficial subdivision of the field of science, the sole teacher 
in charge of all the science subjects has the possibility 
for such conservation of teaching energy that a real 
unification of the sciences is accomplished. That any 
full realization of these possibilities is rarely found is 
a matter of the personality and fitness of an instructor 
rather than of opportunity open to him. 
In very many features high school instruction in 
several science branches overlaps, especially in those 
of composite nature such as agriculture and physical 
geography. General science as a subject in junior high 
126

THE SCIENCE TEACHER ~ 
schools professedly recognizes no divisions of the nat- 
ural sciences. Many of the same phenomena and ex- 
periments taught in general science occur in the suc- 
ceeding courses where they may be reviewed rather 
than repeated without loss in teaching worth. Indeed, 
this “spiral” recurrence of essential topics is at all times 
highly desirable. What shall or shall not be retained 
from high school courses in botany, zoology, and phys- 
iology in the make-up of a year’s course in biology is 
but an illustration of attempts to unify teachings of 
secondary school sciences. 
Lessons upon combustion, centered it may be in the 
burning of a candle, serve equally well as an introduc- 
tion to teachings about oxygen and carbon dioxide in 
chemistry; to ventilation and atmospheric conditions 
affecting health in physiology and hygiene; and to 
studies of convection currents, atmospheric circulation, 
weather and climate in physics and physical geography. 
In the teachings of all secondary school sciences a 
“general science approach” makes more certain many 
a teacher’s success. Where pupils are plunged into 
consideration of subject matter without any prepara- 
tion in knowledge of what is sought, and without any 
well-developed desire for attaining some end in par- 
ticular, the haste defeats the teaching possibilities in- 
volved. That elementary courses in science shall be 
general in their teachings lessens in nowise the demand 
that always they must be scientific in spirit and in 
procedure. A course in general science, though com- 
127 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  TEACHING OR SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
plete in itself as an educational unit, at the same time 
serves equally well as a foundation for further studies 
in the fields of natural science. Its success as a high 
school course, even more than for science courses of a 
more restricted scope, Nemes a superior degree of 
teaching ability and a mastery of teaching procedure in 
science instruction. 
In laboratory administration even more than in the 
classroom the teacher’s personality is indispensable. 
Character may be sufficiently defined as “what one is” 
—the sum total of his beliefs, mental reactions and 
emotions. It is the general state of mind of which 
one’s behavior at all times is an expression. Person- 
ality on the other hand may be considered as character 
in action in so far as it influences, controls, and mo- 
tivates others. “Without a strong personality, the 
science teacher as a teacher is relatively a failure. This 
is not necessarily from any lack in disciplinary capa- 
bilities by which conduct in others is shaped as result 
of influences and forces largely or wholly external to 
them. But it is want of an impelling power which 
shapes character in others by forces developed from 
within them. 
There is, too, a necessary amount of drudgery, of 
painstaking effort, connected with the experimental 
side of science teaching which in efficient teaching 
service can neither be shirked nor turned over to 
assistants. “The instructor must know his pupils as 
128  
-P-A-G-E-141
  
  THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
registered in the work done by them. This involves 
an intimate knowledge of the pupil’s labored and halt- 
ing efforts in the experimental phases of science, as 
well as what is learned of the individual pupil in class- 
room tests. It would be far easier for the instructor 
himself, in matters of technique and of thought ex- 
pression, to do what he must patiently and persistently 
seek to have done by the pupil. 
It may be taken for granted that it is largely out 
of question for the science instructor to train pupils in 
the art of study without himself possessing a well- 
defined understanding of what is involved in it. He, 
too, should be a student. The painstaking and con- 
sistent efforts necessary with beginners through the 
early stages of secondary school science to establish in 
them both a scientific attitude toward problems of life 
in and out of school, and a scientific method of solu- 
tion of these problems, seems to be wholly impossible 
for some teachers regardless of their information along 
scientific lines. Their thought processes, and their out- 
look on the ways and purposes of science teaching, in 
large degree preclude their success. To be able to ar- 
rive at scientific conclusions, and to grasp scientific 
teachings by leaps and bounds, is in itself no mark of 
fitness for the training of pupils in elementary science. 
Lack of success in the first efforts of recent college 
graduates is not infrequently due to a lack of apprecia- 
' tion by them of the fact that their pupils cannot 
129
-P-A-G-E-142
TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
master the beginnings in science courses at any such 
rate of acquisition of knowledge as they themselves 
have become accustomed to as college students. 
Aside from differences in natural ability, the high 
school pupil has not yet acquired the art of learning 
to an extent supposedly possessed by his teacher. The 
beginning teacher succeeds only insofar as he recognizes 
the limitations of ability in his pupils, and adapts his 
course in teaching accordingly. A teaching tempera- 
ment which day by day avoids monotony, and while 
giving attention to all important details at the same 
time moves steadily and methodically forward, is im- 
perative in science instruction. If the teacher treats 
the quest for knowledge as though it were an interest- 
ing and purposeful undertaking, he will induce his 
pupils by imitation to put more effort into the work. 
Striking phenomena for teaching ends serve to chal- 
lenge attention and to stimulate interest, and a judi- 
cious intermixture of these with the more exacting re- 
quirements aids in all sustained progressive efforts. 
The guidance of pupils by the science teacher, es- 
pecially in the laboratory work and its related lesson 
preparation, involves tact and sympathy. Especially 
must there be an ‘alertness in noting just when and 
where to render assistance, and when to stop giving 
aid. To rob a pupil of the results he himself might 
attain through supervised efforts is to take away the 
joys of achievement, and with it the incentive to 
further efforts. But perhaps even more emphasis is 
130  
-P-A-G-E-143
  THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
to be placed upon the need to steer a middle course 
between neglect on the one hand, and on the other 
those repeated interferences with a pupil at work, 
amounting simply to meddlesomeness, whatever may 
be the helpful spirit in which it is done. When pupils 
are not doing what is worth while, it is of course the 
teacher’s duty to prevent their wasting time and effort. 
But this interference is solely for the purpose of sub- 
stituting something that is more worth while. 
Any discussion of science teaching in secondary 
schools is to little purpose where the qualifications of 
a teacher are minimized or ignored. Preparation and 
personality happily combined may so dominate any 
teaching situation as to win success despite lack of 
school equipment or indifference on the part of pupils. 
Indeed, pupils will not long remain indifferent under 
such a teacher. Some of the finest teaching, and much 
of the most significant research work in science, has 
been done by great master teachers and investigators 
whose material equipment was apparently utterly in- 
adequate. The science teacher who is tempted to feel 
discouraged because of the poor equipment offered him 
may well take courage, treating his condition as a 
challenge to his ingenuity. With instructors unfit for 
science teaching by reason of lack of aptitude and per- 
sonality, of suitable preparation in subject matter and 
in teaching procedure, no equipment however complete 
assures the educational values which are possible 
through science studies. It is not enough that science 
131 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
texts and manuals of superior excellence be published, 
and laboratory furniture and apparatus and supplies 
be provided, and that finely appointed buildings with 
their suites of science rooms be erected. Advocates of 
the educational values of science studies in public 
schools must ever insist that well-qualified teachers 
of science be the rule in the small high schools even as 
in the large. 
To be a success as a science teacher involves ape 
exercise of no mean administrative ability, and a de- 
gree of executive talent, persistence, and initiative not 
unlike that possessed by the old-time housewife who 
in the farm home of earlier days contrived without aid 
of modern conveniences to spin and weave, to cut and 
mend, make and wash all the clothing worn by her 
household; to arrange the supply of foods for the 
family, and to cook and serve the family meals with 
all the kitchen labors incident thereto; and in a daily 
round of duties from early dawn to late at night find 
time to be family nurse and physician, instructor of 
childhood and a veritable helpmate and counselor to 
her husband in manifold business and social relation- 
ships. Pay by the hour for this labor, with “time-and- 
a-half for all over-time,” was unknown. 
There are duties and responsibilities and labors de- 
volving upon teachers, too, for which no reward in 
salary is to be expected. No defense is made for the 
drudgery and barrenness of life experienced by the 
women of pioneer days, nor any advocacy of a return 
132
-P-A-G-E-145
  THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
to such manner of life, capable and proficient as the 
women who survived may have become in the hard 
school of experience. But emphasis is laid upon the 
fact that a teacher in public school service assumes 
certain duties and responsibilities in loco parentis 
which in nowise can rightly be ignored, and for which 
no salary as compensation is to be expected. In this 
field of endeavor the real teacher may become a power- 
ful constructive influence for the embodiment in pupils 
of all those virtues which characterize the best types of 
manhood and womanhood. In it lies the largest de- 
gree of teaching success. One may well be doubtful if 
salaries paid will of themselves ever command the 
desired personality, instructional skill, and administra- 
tive efficiency required of science teachers. Neverthe- 
less, judging from the past, in every generation there 
may be expected an idealism in young manhood and 
womanhood which sees in teaching an opportunity for 
service, and for some years of their lives at least this 
may be counted upon to make good to them what the 
pay check lacks. 
There are not wanting some compensations which 
come to the successful teacher. There are leisure times 
between terms giving opportunity for study and, it may 
be, for travel. Then, too, the atmosphere incident to 
teaching service is different from that of the atmos- 
phere of commerce, or of industry, with all their com- 
petition and strife. Best of all there comes to a life- 
long teacher, perchance somewhat tardily at times, 
133
-P-A-G-E-146
a A a i a i A TN I oe rr ee 
TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
recognition by former pupils of services rendered them 
by him. Viewed in this light the work is its own re- 
ward. It remains true, of course, that the laborer is 
worthy of his hire, and that an adequate living wage 
for teachers should be provided. But under the opera- 
tion of economic laws, and because of results inevitable 
where men seek first not the welfare of others but an 
exaltation of self, it is not in the nature of things to 
expect that financial returns from teaching service will 
ever measure up to its true importance as services 
rendered to individuals, to community, and to state. 
Undesirable as this condition is for teaching as a pro- 
fession, and open to objections as it is in other respects, 
it does serve to attract an idealistic rather than a 
materialistic type of teachers, and to some extent at 
least to repel the self-seeking and the ignoble. 
No amount of enthusiasm is a substitute for ability 
and skill in teaching; neither has science any large 
place for the dreamer and for those whose teachings 
do not rest upon the solid foundations of scholarship. 
In this connection, too, the general public with school 
boards as their representatives should demand of 
teacher-training institutions of high and low degree a 
maximum of emphasis upon a virility of moral as well 
as of intellectual life on the part of teacher-candidates. 
Evidence should be forthcoming of some reasonably 
well-matured convictions and beliefs concerning the 
relative worth of those various factors which influence 
young life for good or ill. One hundred per cent man-

hood and womanhood in the teaching force of the pub- 
lic school is fundamental to the welfare of society, and 
to the perpetuity of our American institutions. 
An enumeration of science subjects represented in 
the curricula of high schools includes agriculture, as- 
ronomy, biology, botany, chemistry, general science, 
Ce physics, physical geography, physiology 
(taught with or as a continuation of hygiene and sani- 
tation), and zodlogy. As these may be taught in all 
sorts of combinations in different schools, any adequate 
preparation as science teacher for the smaller high 
schools is scarcely to be expected, and any salary paid 
cannot be the sole solution for the teacher-problem 
here presented. A marked degree of general capability 
is necessary to the teacher confronted by conditions 
commonly faced by science teachers, and it must be 
listed as a prime qualification in all candidates. Edu- 
cational agencies conversant with the available supply 
report year by year the number of “suitably qualified” 
science teachers entirely inadequate for the needs of 
the public schools.

      CHAPTER XIII 
PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION OF THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
However much in common there be in the aims and 
personal characteristics of those intending to become 
science teachers, any discussions of professional prep- 
aration for them of necessity follows a natural though 
rather vague line of cleavage. Separate consideration 
is here given tofneeds of science teachers in the larger 
schools as apart from those who teach in smaller high 
schools. It is a distinction between conditions where 
an instructor’s work is confined to a single science con- 
trasted with conditions common in smaller high schools 
where any sort of combination of science and other 
subjects may be taught by the sole science teacher, 
and where at the same time the science teacher may 
be the principal of the school and athletic coach as 
well. In one of these two fields the work undertaken 
and the preparation for it is very definite; the tenure 
of position and salary enjoyed is reasonably good. On 
the other hand, the teacher situation in small high 
schools is made doubly difficult by reason of economic 
and local controls. However, the persistent demand 
made by parents in behalf of their children’s schooling, 
taken with or apart from college entrance requirements 
137 
   
-P-A-G-E-150
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
and always in combination with the spirit of self- 
sacrifice on the part of a succession of enthusiastic 
teachers of science, makes an effort to maintain some 
approach to standard conditions for science teaching 
in small high schools not at all hopeless. 
So far as choice of instructors for science depart- 
ments of large high schools is concerned, and standards 
of teacher-fitness to which such instructors must con- 
form, there is little need for discussion here. Pre- 
sumably both the selection of teachers, and the power 
to fix and maintain standards, are in the hands of those 
whose capability is conceded. The success of any 
school administration depends in no small degree upon 
wise choices for a teaching force. The personal char- 
acteristics of science teachers is a topic which has been 
discussed. It is to be mentioned, however, that recog- 
nition more and more is being given to a need that 
science teachers even as other teachers be well 
grounded in principles of education based upon a 
knowledge of the psychology of teaching processes; 
that there be a sure grasp of teaching aims, and of the 
most direct ways in attaining these ends; that there be 
such a clearness of vision concerning social backgrounds 
for instructional efforts as reasonably assures marked 
success in teaching even before it is undertaken. “It is 
not enough to have “specialized” in the particular 
science one undertakes to teach. By very reason of this 
specialization it becomes quite possible that a would-be 
instructor has alienated himself from interest in and 
138
-P-A-G-E-151
  PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION 
sympathy for those who as his pupils are merely be- 
ginners in science studies, perchance indifferent stu- 
dents at that. To fail of being conscious at all times 
in the teaching process of the outlook of pupils because 
one’s own tastes have developed into more advanced 
fields of study not infrequently has proved fatal to 
success in the teaching of science in high schools. 
Success in teaching must be measured in terms of 
teaching children as distinguished from teaching sub- 
jects. The psychology of salesmanship has many help- 
ful suggestions to teachers in securing from pupils the 
desired positive reactions to teaching efforts. 
Inexperience on the part of a teacher not unnatur- 
ally mistakes the teaching of subject matter to be the 
end in view. Without guidance and constructive criti- 
cism through the first months of teaching endeavor a 
beginning teacher may not only fail to develop a well- 
grounded self-confidence as to teaching ability, but 
may come face to face with a disastrous close to a 
short-lived teaching career. In these failures the inter- 
ests of pupils in schools most unfortunately are in- 
volved. For the welfare of pupils, and for the main- 
tenance of a teacher-supply better fitted for science 
teaching in high schools, there is no satisfactory sub- 
stitute for teacher-training. 
A full major in some one science is a prerequisite for 
anyone who looks forward to departmental teaching of 
science in the larger high schools. This preparation 
in some one single field should give the whole setting 
139  
-P-A-G-E-152
    TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
of that science—its history as to stages of development, 
its applications in the affairs of men, the most recent 
advances made in it, and the problems it presents 
awaiting solution through research. Lacking such 
preparation, one’s advancement in rank and salary is 
handicapped if not prevented howsoever satisfactory 
that teaching service may be. In connection with this 
major, suitable choices of other science courses either 
physical or biological are readily made, possibly as a 
minor, giving a proper balance and perspective to the 
field of science teaching as a whole. With a thorough 
understanding and definite knowledge of science more 
extensive than the subjects to be taught, and with a 
spirit of persistency in well doing accompanied by an 
abundance of faith in the possibilities of youth, there 
must be combined as preparation for a life’s work of 
teaching high school sciences a definite understanding 
of the theory and principles of education. These once 
were learned only (and well learned, too, in many 
cases) through experience, but always at the expense 
of hapless pupils. This preparation is possible at the 
hands of master instructors in the field of Education. 
In turning to a consideration of professional prepara- 
tion on the part of those who are teachers of science in 
the small high schools of the country, deplorable con- 
ditions are not infrequently noted. Any permanent 
betterment of these conditions must come in part at 
least through efforts of leaders among science teachers 
possessed of a vision of what must be made true con- 
140
-P-A-G-E-153
  PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION 
cerning science instruction before its educational values 
become a notable asset in high school teaching. It is 
well in this connection to visualize the condition that 
of 16,000 and more high schools in the United States 
two-thirds of them have 75 pupils or less apiece, and 
but 5 per cent of the high schools have an attendance 
exceeding 500 pupils. Where science teachers in these 
smaller high schools have had some preparation for 
their teaching, it is quite likely to be inadequate in 
breadth of vision of the whole field of science as it 
affects the lives and interests of pupils. It is more 
likely to have been an intensive rather than an exten- 
sive preparation in subject matter for teaching. More- 
over it is very likely that theory and methods courses 
in education have been so divorced from whatever sub- 
ject matter is to be taught as to become mere ab- 
stractions, and in many cases but a shibboleth of the 
vocabulary of education, lacking in vital relationships 
and significance. 
Courses in educational theory, history, and measure- 
ments are not infrequently taken by prospective 
teachers when they might better be engaged in a 
struggle with the difficulties incident to a shifting of 
viewpoint from that of a pupil under direction to that 
of an instructor upon whom falls the responsibilities of 
directing instructional processes. Methods of teaching 
a science often may be studied to better advantage in 
connection with the mastery of difficult portions of it 
*Bulletin No. 19 (1920), Bureau of Education, Washington, D. C. 
141 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
    TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
rather than wholly apart from its subject matter. 
Science students, too, by very reason of their science 
training rebel at having put before them as beginners 
a study of the theory of education apart from its facts. 
To them theory develops out of facts, and it is quite 
conceivable that “Education” in its first stages even as 
with science instruction should be inductive rather than 
deductive. 
It is likely that differences of opinion will ever exist 
as to what constitutes suitable preparation for the ex- 
ceedingly difficult situations confronting teachers of 
science in smaller high schools. Nevertheless, it is 
high time that frank recognition be given of a respon- 
sibility resting upon science teachers in active service 
in colleges and in secondary schools to join hands 
with teacher-training institutions to the extent at least 
of directing to these institutions young men and women 
who by natural tastes and special aptitudes give 
promise of becoming teachers of superior worth and 
fitness.2 In any student body can be found certain 
“choice spirits’ who in due time and in their genera- 
tion may become capable of inspiring youth to seek 
the best there is in manhood and womanhood. These 
capable ones are to be sought out, and upon them 
should be urged the advantages, the opportunities, and 
the responsibilities for service social and civic through- 
out the years of their public school teaching. For them

4 broad rather than a narrowly intensive preparation 
in science subjects should be combined with suitable 
courses in methods and practice which exemplify 
well-defined educational principles. 
With such concerted effort as thus set forth the situ- 
ation with regard to a teacher supply for science in- 
struction in small high schools would be greatly im- 
proved, and as a problem it might disappear entirely. 
These better conditions would persist in spite of the 
endless “turnover” occurring in the teaching forces of 
secondary schools. Though but a small number of 
such students be found in any one science department 
in colleges, or in the science classes of any high school, 
the aggregate per year of those thus called to be science 
teachers would be large. Science teachers may thus 
extend their services to society, and as recruiting agents 
can promote better science teaching. It is suicidal for 
science departments of colleges and universities to 
maintain an indifferent attitude towards the standards 
of science instruction prevailing in high schools. In 
these high schools are trained the generations of those 
who are to become leaders in citizenship, and through 
whom must come appreciation of scientific achieve- 
ments in relation to civilization and the industrial pros- 
perity of a nation. 
It is not asking too much to demand that none but 
suitably qualified and specially trained teachers give 
instruction in science. 'The extent and completeness 
of this preparation of necessity involves the laws of

economics, and a survival of the fittest. To this prob- 
lem of teacher-supply various organizations of science 
teachers may fittingly apply themselves in seeking 
ways whereby to influence powerfully and persistently 
for the better all those conditions which affect the 
teaching of secondary school science unfavorably. In 
all such efforts little direct co-operation need be ex- 
pected on the part of that great silent majority of high 
school science teachers never in attendance upon meet- 
ings of science organizations, and who are not reached 
as readers of publications for teachers of secondary 
school science. Let science organizations acting in 
conjunction with other effectively organized bodies 
promoting educational efficiency, and with officials of 
departments of education, insist upon and in due time 
secure tests of fitness for teaching science in high 
schools which shall serve as effective barriers to those 
who manifestly are unfitted for science teaching. 
By what stretch of the imagination is fitness for 
teaching science tested by ability to “pass,” with a 
grade of 75 per cent or upwards, an examination ba.ed 
upon a list of ten questions for which sufficient prep- 
aration is made by “cramming” the statements of some 
high school text in science, especially when this has 
been aided by study of lists of questions given in pre- 
vious examinations through a period of years. Where

of ability to reach just decisions readily; of mastery of 
teaching principles and teaching procedure; and of any 
wide outreach in general knowledge and in human in-

of recitations.” *Y All progress in science instruction in 
high schools fails of its full fruitage without competent 
instructors. The problem of schools must ever be one 
of the human element as embodied in teacher no less 
than in pupils. Let science teachers in service aid in 
its solution.

THE SCIENCE TEACHER AND THE COMMUNITY 
The problem of social contact and community ser- 
vice for science teachers in the large school systems is 
very different from that for teachers in the smaller 
towns and cities. Special consideration needs to be 
given conditions which affect the life services of science 
teachers in the schools of large cities. No such social 
prominence and personal influence is as likely there as 
may be taken for granted in smaller towns. Special 
effort is necessary to attain and extend the influence 
on community life which science teachers may and 
should exert by reason not only of personality but as 
well because of what they are capable of contributing. 
It will be necessary to make sacrifices of time and 
effort, and perchance of money, to seize upon and hold 
opportunities for service other than those of a routine 
of adjustments within the mechanism of a highly or- 
ganized school system. At the same time much of 
what is here said concerning these conditions affecting 
science teachers in large cities is applicable in some 
degree, and with modifications it may be, to science 
teachers everywhere. 
Teachers as a class in contrast with doctors, lawyers, 
147
-P-A-G-E-160
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
engineers and professional men generally, are at times 
criticized adversely because lacking in professional and 
community spirit. A number of good reasons may be 
given for any actual lack in this respect. Chief among 
these causes, perhaps, is the fact that teachers as a rule 
have not been able to afford the expenditure necessary 
for an active participation in professional and com- 
munity affairs. Another factor making against such 
activities has been the transient character of teaching 
as an employment, both as regards leaving the profes- 
sion voluntarily after using it as a stepping stone to 
another profession, or in the case of women in order ta 
marry. Then, too, there is uncertainty of tenure in 
positions, accompanied by frequent moving from place 
to place. 
With the general increase in salary schedules of 
teachers during the World War period, and with in- 
creasing numbers of young people entering the teach- 
ing profession with the idea of making it their per- 
manent calling, there should be a notable increase on 
the part of science teachers in professional spirit and 
in the manifestation of community spirit. Aside from 
the moral obligation which is upon all teachers as in- 
dividuals, any such manifestation is profitable in the 
long run for all concerned. \It tends toward an exten- 
sion of professional prestige when the public takes note 
that teachers as a class make considerable expenditures 
in behalf of the interests of the community at large. ‘It

repays teachers richly by increasing their personal in- 
fluence, and the respect in which they are held. 
What is true of teachers in general is especially and 
peculiarly true of science teachers. In this more or 
less materialistic age people are prone to have a su- 
perior regard for that which they see is immediately 
useful. Among the many lessons of the World War, 
people learned that science is exceedingly useful to 
mankind. They became convinced that science sub- 
jects are very much worth while. Science teachers are 
on this account in a position to get more readily, per- 
haps, than other teachers the support and approbation 
of the public for any efforts toward a better profes- 
sional and community standing. It devolves upon us 
to use this advantage in a spirit of noblesse oblige. It 
is the purpose of this chapter to point out in concrete 
ways how to go about improving the situation. 
The extent to which the following suggestions may 
be carried out will depend largely upon circumstances 
such as the size of the city in which one lives, govern- 
ing as this does his opportunities, and upon the salary 
which one receives. Personal and family obligations, 
too, enter into these situations as between teachers on 
similar salaries. While no extravagance in respect to 
expenditures for professional advancement is urged, a 
short-sighted parsimony has too often been true of 
teachers. It is the part of wisdom for teachers to 
expend time and energy and money in order to in- 
149 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
crease their own influence, and the prestige of the 
teaching profession. 
Probably the first definite step to be taken by a 
science teacher looking toward the advancement of his 
professional interests is to” join some scientific society 
representing his major line of interest. A national 
society with its important journals, and its large mem- 
bership and influence, is usually to be preferred when 
one is so situated as to be able to attend meetings of 
its local sections. “One should seek opportunities of 
coming in contact with people interested’ in his own 
particular field of science. At meetings of scientific 
societies those who are applying the science in in- 
dustry, or making original investigations in it; meet 
with those who are teaching it. A teacher is thus 
mingling with men who are in the forefront of his 
particular field of science. He keeps up-to-date as re- 
gards discoveries made, and all new uses of his subject. 
He may find parts of his most recent textbooks out 
of date, but he is able to keep his pupils abreast of 
all advances made. 
On his part the teacher will have his influence on the 
industrial men. They will find that his work and theirs 
have much in common. Membership in a scientific 
society brings with it, too, an opportunity and an obli- 
gation to prepare and deliver from time to time articles 
upon various topics connected with the society’s inter- 
ests. The teacher frequently can do this to better 
advantage than an industrial worker in science. Es- 
150
-P-A-G-E-163
  THE SCIENCE TEACHER AND THE COMMUNITY 
pecially is this true when some of the more theoretical 
and historical parts of a subject are involved. The 
teacher has brought to him in turn the details of ap- 
plications of his science, and a live human fellowship. 
A teacher, too, usually can give the time to serve as an 
officer, especially as secretary of a section, even better 
than an industrial man. 
‘The science teacher should not neglect opportunities 
for community acquaintanceship and service offered by 
his own church, the local lodge, the chamber of com- 
merce or board of trade, establishing for himself in all 
their fields relationships mutually beneficial. To their 
credit it may be said of teachers generally that they do 
not as a rule fail in support of those various agencies 
which promote social, moral, and religious betterment. 
The hard-pressed forces which struggle under heavy 
handicap to maintain some sufficient amount of re- 
ligious instruction in American life have reason to ex- 
pect of science teachers some portions of their time 
and teaching ability, and such other support as they 
are able to give. 
Within his own school the science teacher can reach | 
his community through a science club! with open 
meetings to which parents and friends of the pupils 
are invited. The personal acquaintance with some of 
the grown-ups which is thus fostered is valuable. The 
parent-teacher organizations, now so widely prevalent, 
offer to the science teacher as to other teachers an op- 
*See p. 317 for suggestion of work for such clubs, 
151 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
portunity at community influence which should be 
grasped. “Opportunities in a social way to meet with 
school officials should be sought and improved. Ac- 
quaintance with them is too often limited to such con- 
tact as becomes necessary in a business way. In large 
cities and towns a school men’s or a school women’s 
club formed largely for social purposes is valuable. It 
should include in its membership not only school board 
members and executive officers such as superintendent, 
assistant superintendents, principals, supervisors, and 
vocational directors but as well the rank and file of 
the teaching forces. One should also be an active 
member of state and national educational associations. 
~ One of the most direct and positive ways for a 
science teacher to get into touch with community in- 
«terests is to visit industrial plants which apply the 
science he is teaching. On the first of these occasions 
the teacher should make a visit by himself; then, if 
conditions permit, classes can be taken later to note 
any certain stages of the work. A little tact may be 
required on the first visit in order to avoid unnecessary 
rebuffs. It will be best to first approach some higher 
official in the organization who appreciates civic rela- 
tionships. Access to nearly any plant may be gained 
where there are no unusual dangers. Care must always 
be exercised on such visits to keep pupils out of danger 
from moving parts of machinery, etc., and to avoid so 
far as possible all interference with employees at their 
labors. The time spent at the plant must be as brief 
152
-P-A-G-E-165
THE SCIENCE TEACHER AND THE COMMUNITY 
as will suffice to illustrate the matter in hand. A little 
publicity for the firm should be given in the school and 
local papers in connection with the trip. This is good 
publicity for the school, too, when written up as real 
news. These trips are to be taken in school time when- 
ever possible to do so without interference with other 
classes, thus permitting attendance of every pupil of 
a class. After-school or Saturday trips may be neces- 
sary to reach factories or municipal plants having to do 
with water supply, or sewage disposal. Such excur- 
sions offer a splendid opportunity to get acquainted 
with pupils as well as with community interests. 
Rightly used they are among the most effective means 
of teaching. 
Science teachers especially well equipped in their 
major subject can be very helpful to industrial con- 
cerns from time to time as problems arise in those 
plants. Acquaintance with such problems may de- 
velop from the visits just discussed, and every oppor- 
tunity for the science teacher to be of assistance should 
be grasped. Such services may mean the making of 
calculations which involve a knowledge of chemistry, 
such as a water-softening problem or a cleansing op- 
eration. In most cases the well-trained science teacher 
can successfully apply his technical knowledge to a 
speedy solution of some such minor problems, and by 
so doing get the regard of the manufacturer for him- 
self and for his school. Whether or not one should 
accept a fee for such services will depend in part upon 
153 
     
-P-A-G-E-166
  ha TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
the value of the results, and. the amount of time and 
skill required for the solution of such problems. Where 
the work is done entirely outside of school time, and 
is strictly without interference either direct or indirect 
with school work, there can be very little objection to 
asking and receiving a reasonable fee. | 
Another community service that technically trained 
science teachers can render is helping out the purchas- 
ing department of the school system. Chemistry 
teachers especially can be helpful in this way. School 
authorities at times buy at extravagant prices under 
fancy names cleaners, soaps, water softeners, etc., 
which might be had under their true names for very 
much less outlay. A simple examination will easily 
determine the nature of most of these things. The 
purchase of materials under exact chemical specifica 
tions will be made possible where the chemistry teacher 
is able to check their nature by analysis. Purchases 
of coal in large quantities may wisely wait upon speci- 
fications as to heat values. Tests to check values of 
deliveries can be made by pupil assistants working 
under direction. Such pupils are always greatly i 
ss in these “real problems.” 
In rural communities science teachers will find 
many opportunities for helpfulness in connection, for 
example, with the office of a county agricultural agent. 
Identification of injurious insects, prescribing methods 
of combating their ravages, use of spray materials for 
insects and for plant diseases, preparation of these 
154 
   
-P-A-G-E-167
  THE SCIENCE TEACHER AND THE COMMUNITY 
spraying solutions, testing and treatments of seeds pre- 
paratory to planting, together with various simple soil 
tests, suggest some of the many things which can be 
done by a science teacher whose knowledge of his sub- 
jects embraces their applications in life’s affairs. 
When a science teacher follows a course somewhat 
as outlined above, it is not long before an acquain- 
tanceship is gained which will enable him to perform 
that exceedingly useful duty in community service in 
the placement of many of his boys and girls at gradua- 
tion in positions which they are capable of filling. This - 
service has a double value in that it is advantageous 
alike for employer and employee. A science teacher 
usually comes to have a pretty good notion of the 
ability, the degree of willingness to work, and the 
special inclinations of his pupils. He can in no small 
measure avoid trying to fit “round pegs into square 
holes.” In many cases an especially bright pupil lack- 
ing the means to go to college may be placed where 
he can earn the necessary amount to make a start, and 
in a place where he will be encouraged by his em- 
ployer to take the time to continue his studies. Part- 
time jobs can be found for pupils who need to earn 
some or all of their expenses while in school. 
With a few years of experience in making careful 
selections of candidates for positions, the science 
teacher will find himself called upon to supply more 
and more graduates. Thus it comes about that both 
the community and the particular individuals served

profit by reason of the intimate knowledge of pupils 
gained by a science teacher through years of service 
in classroom and laboratory. This intimacy is pecu- 
liarly the privilege of science teachers, and these ser- 
vices rendered are wholly supplementary to their other 
labors as teachers. All remuneration lies, of course, in 
the satisfaction derived from having served well where 
service was greatly needed. 
Summary 
1. Criticisms of teachers generally for lack of community 
and professional spirit, and lack of co-operation with 
helpful agencies. 
2. Opportunities of science teachers to overcome adverse 
criticisms. 
Comparisons with opportunities had by teachers other 
than in science. 
3. Suggestions of specific things which can be done: 
Active affiliation with national, state, and local scien-

Magazines, and published reports of proceedings. 
Writing as well as reading papers on science subjects. 
Local clubs, lodges, church work. 
Science clubs for pupils and school patrons. 
Parent-teacher associations. 
Personal acquaintanceships with parents, school offi- 
cials. Teachers’ clubs. Visits to local factories, shops, 
municipal plants. 
Technical assistance to local manufacturers, to pur- 
chasing department of the school system, to agricul- 
tural and horticultural interests.

  CHAPTER XV. 
THE SCIENCE TEACHER AS A BUILDER OF CHARACTER 
When contemplating the achievements of science 
during a generation, and when considering ways and 
means to keep instruction in secondary school sciences 
abreast of scientific progress insofar as its applications 
and theories affect industrial and social life, educators 
very naturally point to expensive buildings and equip- 
ment, to adequate provisions in apparatus and li- 
braries, and to the many secondary school science texts 
and manuals of superior excellence as sufficient evi- 
dence of educational advances. 
However, when due credit has been given for this 
wonderful array of resources for science teaching, they 
are a means only to the end desired. It is efficient 
manhood and womanhood which must ever be the pri- 
mary object of school instruction and training. No 
subordination of this chief end of educational processes 
to the means employed in attaining it, no loss of 
development of individual lives by reason of striving 
for greater efficiency in the mechanism of school ad- 
ministration, can be justified. : 
It is one thing to allow that the chief purpose of 
schools and of the subjects taught in schools is the 
157
-P-A-G-E-170
  ome, TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
upbuilding of manhood and womanhood in individuals, 
and to say that well-balanced, properly-developed 
personalities are indispensable for the perpetuation of 
social order and progress. It is quite another matter 
consistently to pursue feasible plans toward accom- 
plishing such an end. In order to preserve itself 
society must conserve not alone human attainments in 
knowledge but as well the ideals of mankind for moral 
and spiritual uplift. Instruction and training in both 
of these must go hand in hand through childhood and 
youth. The most efficient school system, and the most 
effective ways of teaching, are wholly compatible with 
such a deterioration in morals and such a lack of ideals 
as to become a menace to civilization, and to the de- 
mands of humanity for freedom and self-government. 
Any teaching of the sciences however well done can 
never justify itself in an American public school sys- 
tem when it loses sight of the supreme end of education 
—exaltation of character. 
»’The greatness of the science teacher as of all teachers 
is measured by the kind of men and women developed 
under his instruction.’ His teaching service must as- 
sume its full measure of responsibility for the views 
held and the efficiency shown by them. The teacher, 
in theory at least, is a constructive force for nobility 
of character in the lives of those coming under his 
direction in school.’ This problem of the schools trans- 
cends in importance all other teaching duties and re- 
sponsibilities. In the smaller high schools, and in the 
158
-P-A-G-E-171
THE SCIENCE TEACHER AS A BUILDER OF CHARACTER 
smaller communities, a science teacher has exceptional 
opportunities for exercise of personal influence in char- 
acter building. 
YAn ability to make decisions is fundamental in all 
who are called to fill positions of trust and responsibil- 
ity. It must be an ability to decide quickly and 
wisely under any and all circumstances, and to grasp 
conditions accurately and comprehensively. With this, 
too, must be the certainty that knowledge of what to 
do assures its being done. And in this assurance lies 
the test of whether or not the character-building proc- 
ess going on in homes and schools, and by reason of 
the various agencies of social and civic life, is succeed- 
ing or is a failure. Whether in jails, or not, most of 
those who are a menace to the peace and security of 
society “know better,” but their enlightenment failed 
to react aright in their own lives and in their civic 
relationships. There is no new and different psychol- 
ogy for moral and for mental integrity and soundness. 
Lack of ability to come to well-considered decisions 
upon questions of moment, even those by which are 
shaped the issues of life, is deplorable. Rarely does 
vanity, or mean ambition, or gratification of self and 
of the baser things of life, become a ruling passion 
through deliberate choice and intent. It should be 
added, too, that a well-ordered life avoids those ways 
which the experiences of others have shown to be un- 
safe. No ship’s navigator tries to see how close to the 
rocks he can run without shipwreck. Decision of char- 
159 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
    TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
acter is in no large sense an accident of birth, of sur- 
roundings, or of circumstances. In all members of the 
human family it is a latent power waiting development 
by well-defined processes much as the body grows and 
waxes strong, intellect expands, and reason becomes 
powerful. Therein lies the possibility of a school and 
home training which shall include character develop- 
ment in conjunction with growth of body and of mind. 
In infant life no fact is more apparent than an in- 
cessant physical activity coincident with .a healthy 
sturdy growth of body. This necessitates an ample 
supply of suitable materials as food whereby the build- 
ing up of muscle and bone, of blood and sinew, of 
nerves and various other organs is made possible. 
Somewhat similar conditions and limitations prevail in 
the realm of intellect whether studied as brain de- 
velopment or apart from it. An exercise of mind is 
involved in all thought processes. Thinking may be 
considered as essentially an act of establishing relation- 
ships between facts. No subject in the curricula of 
secondary schools justifies its place save that through 
use of its facts and theories the mental processes of 
pupils are stimulated, their mental habits established, 
and the material for thought provided in larger meas- 
ure than by use of other alternative subjects. 
Training for efficiency in schools does not seek to 
make skilled operators of the machinery of business 
and industrial life, nor on the other hand successful 
bidders for public favor in professional or political life 
160
-P-A-G-E-173
  THE SCIENCE TEACHER AS A BUILDER OF CHARACTER 
as ends in themselves. Instead there is to be sought 
those higher aims summed up in the familiar phrase 
“‘character-building,” a-training which seeks to develop 
in individuals the two-fold power of being able to 
choose aright and to execute effectively. We are as- 
tonished at times to note the rise in the affairs of the 
world of a boy thrown early upon his own resources 
into the thick of a struggle for existence. We marvel, 
too, at times at the little accomplished by some well- 
schooled youth whose mental and physical endow- 
ments appeared equally good with the other. Often- 
times, in such cases, it requires but little inquiry to 
discover that he who made his way unaided of schools, 
and by reason of sheer energy well directed, has what 
the other lacks—an ability for close definite observa- 
tion, a readiness and keenness in inferring those re- 
lationships between facts which as inferences are true 
to the facts involved. If a boy has spent from sixteen 
to twenty years in school and lacks power to grasp the 
facts of his surroundings in any of the common situa- 
tions of life, and is unable to reach quickly conclusions 
of his own based upon such facts, whose fault is it? It 
is equally pertinent at this point to inquire how school 
training may be shaped to contribute a maximum in 
readiness of decision, and in accuracy of conclusion. 
Whatever explanations are advanced by the psychol- 
ogist for any acquired readiness in grasping conditions 
and in establishing relationships of facts, for any unity 
between thought and execution or between any act and 
161
-P-A-G-E-174
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
that which prompts it, it is a matter of common experi- 
ence that execution is perfected, is more speedily ac- 
complished, and is accomplished with less effort as the 
result of practice. Any habit, either of thought or as 
a muscular act, results from much repetition of it in 
a particular way. The violinist acquires by long and 
arduous practice a control over the muscles of finger 
and arm whereby melody seems to flow from the finger 
ps. 
‘Education essentially is a matter of habit forma- 
tion, not merely a familiarity with the contents of 
books. To be educated is a matter of prompt reactions 
of an habitually right sort to the stimuli of life’s ex- 
periences rather than an ability to answer lists of ques- 
tions in examinations. )And this is none the less true 
in spite of the fact that credits and graduations and 
degrees must continue to be granted in large part upon 
the evidence of knowledge made manifest through ex- 
aminations. It is so easy to mistake the means used 
for the end sought! In health teachings in schools, 
for example, lessons in hygiene and sanitation furnish 
a good illustration of the difficulties attendant upon 
educational efforts for habit formation, and the scant 
success too commonly attained. The immediate end 
of all instruction by teachers concerning health control 
is granted to be a fixation through practice of health 
habits conducive to individual usefulness and happi- 
ness. Studies of health and hygiene in their impor- 
162
-P-A-G-E-175
  THE SCIENCE TEACHER AS A BUILDER OF CHARACTER 
tance rank among the first in all courses in schools 
in spite of a wide-spread neglect of them, and the 
generally unsatisfactory teaching results from them. 
Any well-developed plan of instruction concerning 
health control, including inhibition of desires and re- 
jection of suggestions leading to questionable courses 
in life, does not consist alone of the instruction given, 
necessary as this may be. It lies rather in a continu- 
ous stimulation of effort, and such sustained guidance 
in life’s ways as necessarily result in an habitual re- 
action to whatever promotes well-being in both in- 
dividual and community life. The same problem is 
met, both in its instructional and its training features, 
in a character-building process in the domain of morals. 
Educational advancement primarily then, whether the 
1aoral element in an individual’s life be included or ex- 
cluded, is a question of what one is and is to become, of 
what one has done and is able to do. It is a matter not 
of apt phrasing of statements of the achievements of 
others, but the characteristic behavior in thought and 
act of an individual himself. “A science teacher’s con- 
cern in all instruction given is to secure in the lives of 
his pupils that degree of scientific attitude and scien- 
tific procedure the natural outcome of which is a sanely 
ordered life in matters of health and morals, and in 
domestic, civic, and industrial relationships. To meas- 
ure up to the demands thus made upon science 
teachers, men and women are needed who are possessed 
163
-P-A-G-E-176
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
of superior worth and ability wholly apart from and in 
addition to their knowledge and skill as instructors in 
science subjects. 
The public school by its instruction and training is 
supposed to fit for a better discharge of life’s duties 
and responsibilities. There must be provided the larg- 
est possible opportunity for growth in power to decide. 
This can best be secured through long sustained prac- 
tice in making decisions. Any such training is to be 
continued until decision and execution habitually fol- 
low consideration of the facts of any situation. Al- 
though it is the ability to think which is the desired end 
in school work rather than any specific thoughts as 
knowledge content, this ability comes only as result of 
having done much thinking. Thought is in itself a 
grand achievement of the human mind, but the power 
to think is a still grander thing! 
Decision of character as an aim of school training can 
be gained only where opportunities for-decision have 
been presented and decisions insisted upon. He is ac- 
counted a teacher of worth who so arranges his work 
as to require of his pupils a maximum of mental effort. 
How much more worthy is he who with all this, and in 
connection with it and at the same time, secures 
through well-directed, well-sustained efforts the power 
to decide. In the make-up of a man or woman no 
characteristic is more of an asset than readiness in 
reaching decisions which are in accord with the facts 
involved. 
164
-P-A-G-E-177
  THE SCIENCE TEACHER AS A BUILDER OF CHARACTER 
While any particular course pursued to attain these 
ends must take into account the individuality of the 
teacher, the subject taught, and the conditions under 
which the instruction is given, this general procedure 
may be followed: 
(1) In the numberless questions asked in science 
classes by teachers let the outstanding purposes of 
these questions ever be to provoke thought, to direct 
it to certain desired ends, and to drill upon instruction 
already given in order to emphasize it. No teacher 
needs to be told that to gain such complete control of 
the thought of every pupil in a class as shall make 
possible throughout a class period a sustained mental 
activity in unity with the class as a whole, with every 
pupil mentally alert and doing “team work” in a pro- 
gressive class thinking, taxes to the uttermost skilled 
teaching powers. Beyond a doubt the weak link in the 
chain of teaching procedure, usually, is the fact that 
but one pupil at a time struggles with the difficulties 
of formulating and expressing thought as an answer 
to each one of the successive questions asked. All 
others of the class for the time being wait passively 
for their turns to recite. It renders unlikely that con- 
tinued mental tension requisite to the highest teaching 
values. Inevitably thinking as a class deteriorates into 
thinking as individuals, and this in turn into thinking 
upon diverse topics unfruitful it may be in teaching 
values. The teacher, in supplying a motive for these 
*See pp. 118-121. 
165
-P-A-G-E-178
TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
individual efforts, arouses one pupil after another n 
turn from passive to active mental conditions, only to 
see this activity lapse again into indifference as another 
pupil is subjected to questioning. 
(2) Let the ideal of class management be to get. 
every pupil to answer every question asked, allowing 
no opportunity for relaxation in mental activity from 
start to finish of the class period. Obviously such 
answers to questions cannot be oral—one pupil only 
can be called upon to speak the class thought. All 
answers are of course subject to corrections and ampli- 
fication by other members of the class, and especially 
by the teacher. Use of the class period daily for any 
extended written responses, whether as a quiz or ex- 
amination, is impracticable because of the burden 
thrown upon the teacher in reviewing these papers. 
Opportunity for instruction by the teacher during the 
class period—the vital purpose of the class session— 
then becomes seriously restricted if not eliminated. 
A class procedure is desired which when consistently 
followed yields in educational advantages much the 
same results as would accrue if every pupil could by 
some means give expression independently to his 
thought in answering every question asked by the 
teacher. The simple expedient (p. 62) of expecting 
and insisting that pupils “raise the hands” indicative 
of a readiness to answer all questions asked for which 
they are able to formulate an answer, is an expedient 
to which teachers in the elementary schools are driven 
166 
  
ars
-P-A-G-E-179
  THE SCIENCE TEACHER AS A BUILDER OF CHARACTER 
in order, it may be, to repress and control expressions 
of mental effervescence. A like procedure in class man- 
agement in secondary schools can be made to promote 
and sustain mental activity otherwise deplorably lack- 
ing. Incidentally, too, it makes uncomfortably con- 
spicuous, any pupil or pupils who for any reason are 
unable or unwilling to do team work responsive to the 
teacher’s leadership. Questions are easily framed from 
time to time so easy to answer that the dullest pupil 
in class cannot plead inability to answer. Cases call- 
ing for change in class membership, and a need for dis- 
ciplinary measures of some sort, are soon apparent. 
(3) Let it be considered that one chief value of 
the raised hand in response to questions asked lies in 
the implied expectancy on the part of pupils that 
anyone whose hand is up is likely to be called upon at 
any time, and possibly time after time. With one only 
called, it does not to any degree rob the others who 
have all formulated answers to a question asked of 
the mental exercise and educational value this becom- 
ing ready to give an answer has involved. The series 
of demands for organizing knowledge to answer ques- 
tion after question, when taken in connection with ex- 
planations, comments, and contributions of facts by 
the instructor, makes of the class period an intensive 
and sustained thought exercise of highest educational 
worth. 
However, there is another phase of this class man- 
agement with which we may well be more particularly 
167
-P-A-G-E-180
Taga a ha ha 
TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
concerned. It is conceived to be true that the excel- 
lency of this class procedure lies in the fact that every 
question asked gives opportunity for every pupil in 
the class to make decisions—decisions (1) as to an 
ability to answer; (2) as to what answer to give, 7. e., 
its form, and content; and (3) what is, perhaps, the 
vital matter—whether or not this answer shall be 
offered voluntarily, inviting to itself criticism and 
possible rejection by the teacher. Schoolroom training 
must fit for the affairs of life outside school. He who 
accomplishes much in life’s work must be able to set 
himself to its tasks, must take the initiative and must 
face possible failure through error in facts, or in reason- 
ing, or in giving wrong or incomplete expression to 
what is in his mind. Jf he wait for the world to force 
him to act, to put into his possession the exact bounds 
for his activities, he is unlikely ever to take an active 
part in its affairs. When in our schoolrooms we call a 
pupil to his feet, and then ask him a question, we have 
by this very act robbed him of an opportunity to take 
the initiative himself in answering. His effort to an- 
swer is by reason of compulsion. He does what he is 
told to do or in too many cases endeavors to evade do- 
ing it. His mental activity is abortive of growth and 
power. He does not decide for himself whether or not 
he is in possession of such facts as to warrant an an- 
swer; whether or not he sees clearly any relationships 
among these facts; and whether or not, of his own ini- 
tiative, to attempt an expression of his views.

  THE SCIENCE TEACHER AS A BUILDER OF CHARACTER 
Real educative processes require the instructor to 
encourage, to stimulate, to lead on to well-considered 
ends the natural activities of those who are to be edu- 
cated. In the kindergarten the child is repeatedly 
called upon to choose, to decide for himself, and to 
abide by his decisions. To make the importance of 
right choices apparent, to encourage thoughtfulness 
and constancy of purpose, to reach deliberate and well- 
considered decisions, these choices when made must be 
regarded as binding. They are to be set aside only 
when after deliberation a wiser choice may be substi- 
tuted. Where in schools beyond the kindergarten is 
special training te this end found? Where in school 
and home training of children and youth is due em- 
phasis placed upon the importance of decisions deliber- 
ately made, and the binding force of them recognized 
when made? 
For any original thinking from members of a class 
there must be furnished something to think about. It 
must be so presented with reference to existing condi- 
tions as to make this thinking of largest value. It is 
the teacher’s part so to arrange his class work, and 
so to put his questions, as to make independence and 
originality of thought not only possible but the only 
acceptable kind of class work. The importance and 
value of well-considered judgments based on known 
facts is at the same time magnified, and any conclu- 
sions deliberately reached must not be lightly changed 
or discarded. In all cases as far as possible these con- 
169  
-P-A-G-E-182
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
clusions are to be reached upon the initiative of the 
pupils. Whether the subject be a science with its many 
phenomena for explanation and classification, or one 
involving the study of mathematical or artistic forms, 
whether history from original sources or a subject from 
any other department of school work, much more can 
be accomplished by keeping constantly in view such 
aims as are set forth above. The emphasis laid upon 
making decisions, and their binding force upon the con- 
duct of the child in the kindergarten, may very well 
be made prominent in all school administration. 
Since the exercise of the child’s powers of thought is 
of greater importance at this stage of his development 
than the result of his thinking, teachers by way of en- 
couraging pupils to think are justified in accepting 
from them, always of course with reservations, more 
or less incorrect and imperfect products of their think- 
ing. More credit may be given at times for use of 
“horse sense” though misdirected, than for correct an- 
swers obviously not original. It must be that the 
value of an acquired habit of original thinking cannot 
be appraised at its full valuation by teachers, else why 
such neglect in requiring it of all pupils to the full 
measure of their abilities? 
Teachers need to exalt in their own thinking the fact 
that it is their province to make the conditions for 
mental growth, to give opportunity for thinking, and 
to insist that thinking be done. Above all they ever 
are to keep in mind that growth is through exercise in 
170 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
        THE SCIENCE TEACHER AS A BUILDER OF CHARACTER 
the individual himself, and through his appropriation 
of the facts which as “thought material” may be 
brought before him. For this growth there must be 
activity—an activity to be guided and not repressed, 
encouraged and urged and insisted upon—an activity 
from within. There is no growth in an automaton 
though when wound up and set going it repeats the 
words and the very inflections of our voices, and gives 
forth without error set forms of words for the correct- 
ness of which it might well claim a mark of 100%. 
There must be life, and an activity responsive to every 
effort to lead it out and to direct it. Take away the 
material for thought, and the necessity for thinking, 
and the intellectual life languishes and is stunted. 
With no suitable exercise of thought effort whereby 
conclusions wholly original are reached, judgments 
formed, decisions made by self-initiative, there results 
enfeeblement of mind rather than strength, deteriora- 
tion rather than growth. The so-called self-educated 
man learns early to think for himself, to rely upon his 
own judgment, to decide quickly, and to act for himself. 
THE FUNCTION OF TEACHERS OF HIGHEST IMPOR- 
1 IN THEIR DAILY ROUND OF TEACHING DUTIES IS SO 
TO TRAIN THOSE UNDER THEIR CHARGE THAT THE POWER 
TO REACH DECISIONS FOUNDED ON FAIR DELIBERATIVE 
THINKING SHALL CHARACTERIZE THE FINISHED PROD- 
ucts or AMERICAN SCHOOLS.

  CHAPTER XVI 
PHASES OF SCIENCE TEACHING IN MORAL EDUCATION 
In connection with a training in school to be prompt 
in making decisions of enduring worth, and along with 
a round of teaching procedure specifically directed to- 
wards habit-formation as a character-building proc- 
ess, the science teacher must ever be keenly alive at 
all times to what constitutes the supreme aim of all 
educational effort. Continuous close attention to the 
details of routine teaching processes tends to dull the 
teacher’s vision. To guide beginners in science so that 
in due time they may become able to walk unaided 
the pathways of scientific achievement is a worthy aim. 
But if this be a purely intellectual process it is not 
enough. The responsibilities of the science teacher 
for manhood and womanhood as a product of the class- 
room and laboratory are to be measured by the oppor- 
tunities in science teaching for shaping aright the lives 
of pupils under instruction. 
It is necessary to be always conscious of what kind 
of habitual reactions to life influences are desired; 
what habits contribute most largely to individual wel- 
fare and to advances in civilization; what manner of 
daily teaching procedure consistently followed, and 
174
-P-A-G-E-187
        PHASES OF SCIENCE TEACHING 
tactfully adapted to changing moods and conditions 
affecting child life, promises not only keenness and, 
capability of intellect but a sane and positive moral 
life. These are aims of primary importance in public 
school education, and upon their attainment through 
the public schools rests no small part of the hope that 
ours is an enduring civilization. 
Promptness and positiveness in reactions to natural 
and social surroundings are notable characteristics of 
that growth into manhood and womanhood sought as 
the chief product of public school education. The 
ideals, aspirations, and beliefs of the race as to what 
constitutes right ways of living are a precious heritage 
to be transmitted from generation to generation, and 
from individual to individual, as “Wisdom of the ages.” 
Any adequate round of school instruction can be made 
to include, in addition to its information and a train- 
ing in effective thinking furnished by its course, a 
wisely planned period of training in which application 
is made of life’s ideals to every-day affairs. Life’s ac- 
tivities may thus be brought into accord with its as- 
pirations and beliefs. The conduct of an individual in 
his reactions to life situations is an index to, and in the 
sum total of those reactions is an expression of, that in- 
tangible though very real existence known as character. 
Merely to tell pupils what is desirable in life just 
as a matter of imparting information is relatively an 
easy task; but it is likely to prove even less effective 
than lecturing to them on scientific topics. To bring 
175
-P-A-G-E-188
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
about an embodiment of it in their life-practices taxes 
the skill and endurance of devoted teaching service, 
and all teachers can expect to experience more or less 
of chagrin over failures to accomplish these highest 
aims in teaching. Efforts to determine quantitatively 
by means of schoolroom quizzes whether or not there 
is manifest any uplift in the aspirations of pupils is 
likely to prove fatal to the ends sought. Character 
development is best tested out in the conduct of indi- 
viduals under normal life conditions. It is not meas- 
ured by an ability to formulate definitions in ethics, 
and rules of conduct for social, business, and religious 
life. In ethics as in elementary science, all assign- 
ments in books are for supplementary purposes only, 
enriching the teaching content and giving to it concise 
and suitable expression in a wisely chosen vocabulary. 
On the other hand, the changeable conditions of 
school life as controlled by the teacher are akin in no 
small degree to life situations, and give ample oppor- 
tunity and incentive for testing-out processes wherein 
conduct can be guided in its right expression, and right 
ideals become established. The chief guarantee against 
complete discouragement on the part of teachers over 
negative results experienced in the training of boys and 
girls, from the years of early childhood on through 
their youthful activities into a manhood and woman- 
hood of high ideals and rightly-ordered daily living, is 
a clear vision of the complete “cycle” of teaching pro- 
cedure. It requires (a) that the procedure followed be 
176
-P-A-G-E-189
  PHASES OF SCIENCE TEACHING 
based upon educational principles; (b) that it be 
adaptable to all normal teaching conditions; and (c) 
that when consistently followed it be reasonably cer- 
tain in due time to yield in some considerable measure 
the results desired. 
Though all pupils cannot be expected to benefit alike 
from equal opportunities in the American school sys- 
tem, it is none the less demanded that every child be 
given these opportunities, and be expected to make 
the most of his natural endowments. This must be 
insisted on both for the welfare of the individual, and 
for the good of society generally. A veritable army of 
instructors, acting in conjunction with other uplifting 
agencies affecting child life, must be kept at work the 
country over striving to attain for every generation in 
turn, and for the individuals therein represented, a 
degree of educational advancement equal to and per- 
chance excelling that of earlier generations. Whatever 
the emphasis placed upon social, economic, industrial, 
or purely intellectual phases of education, and what- 
ever the special procedure necessary to stress any one 
of these, fundamental to them all is an unceasing effort 
to attain in every life the best of which it is capable. 
Along with every phase of educational advancement 
must go such a translation into conduct of a knowledge 
of right ways of living as shall inevitably yield in 
every life the best it can attain. In immorality lies 
the way of destruction of humanity. In non-moral 
educational agencies there lies no hope for civiliza- 
av7 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
tion. Instruction in schools which fails to incite pupils 
to sustained efforts intellectual and moral, and which 
fails to establish an abiding lifelong desire for knowl- 
edge and righteousness, has in it possibilities only 
rather than any realization of true educational ad- 
vancement. Instruction in and of itself is as seed 
whose growth is assured provided favorable conditions 
are maintained. This is no less true in the realm of 
moral education than in other phases of intellectual 
development. 
A large measure of attention must be given towards 
securing that state of mind in pupils characterized as 
teachableness, even as in agriculture it is necessary 
that soil conditions at seed-time shall be made such as 
to warrant reasonable expectations of a bountiful har- 
vest. In all teaching there must be a continuity in the 
use of wisely chosen stimuli corresponding roughly to 
wisely persistent crop cultivation. As in agriculture 
where failure of a bountiful harvest is invited by an 
excessive amount of seed, the young plants having to 
make a struggle for existence, so it is in teaching. An 
overabundance of information as facts only, poured out 
upon pupils in unreceptive mental conditions, is un- 
likely to become fruitful in constructive thought proc- 
esses. It tends rather to deaden and perchance it kills 
all desire for the “knowledge learned of schools.” 
\ducation is not inaptly described as progress in 
attaining an attitude of mind, and a readiness in mental 
reactions, which makes the individual habitually re- 
178
-P-A-G-E-191
PHASES OF SCIENCE TEACHING 
sponsive to all influences and situations in life that 
are uplifting in their effect upon him individually, and 
helpful to his fellows.) These responses when habitual 
free the mind for attention to other things, and furnish 
opportunity for further advances in knowledge and in 
intellectual capability. Character formation is not 
measured by the number of years of one’s age. 
Normally, indeed, there should come with advancing 
years the putting aside of childish things, and of those 
mental stages characteristic of childhood in their un- 
certainties and changeableness. In place of these 
should come well-founded decisions suitable to intel- 
lectual maturity and of abiding value. 
The dependable, safe-and-sane American citizen is 
he who has come almost instinctively to do what duty 
requires, and whose response to every situation affect- 
ing others as well as himself waits only for information 
enough to determine what is the right thing to do. 
To hesitate over doing the right thing, to postpone 
doing it, to seek to evade duty, to consider at length 
whether or not one can with regard to his own safety 
do what he knows should not be done, stamps one as 
yet a child so far as real manhood is concerned. Such 
a lack of right reactions, occurring habitually in an in- 
dividual as though by instinct, makes him a source of 
weakness rather than of strength in society, and an 
undesirable type of citizen however brilliant his in- 
tellectual attainments. 
It would be out of place here to give any extended 
179
-P-A-G-E-192
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
discussion of habit formation as a modification in brain 
structure, and as a development of connections be- 
tween nerve centers whereby there becomes possible a 
re-routing of oft-repeated impulses of the same or 
similar character so as to demand a minimum of seri- 
ous consideration on the part of an individual. But 
the educator in general, and the science teacher in par- 
ticular, faces a consideration of whether or not there 
is lacking the educational results to be expected from 
the vast expenditures of time and effort in public 
schools; and if so, whether any such lack may not be 
traced directly to want of continuity in habit-forming 
thought processes throughout the years of school life. 
There needs to be much repetition of a round of well- 
defined mental processes, involving a clear discernment 
by pupils of what is sought in every cycle, and what is 
necessary to its attainment. This is as true, too, in 
moral as in scientific training, and it is an entirely dif- 
ferent thing from the drills of elementary schools de- 
signed to co-ordinate sensory and motor impulses. The 
habit sought is concerned with general mental proc- 
esses, and is one which stimulates rather than limits 
initiative and constructive thinking. 
In science teaching the remedy for this lack clearly 
enough is not an additional amount of information— 
not more facts for which the pupil neither cares nor 
is prepared. There is no insurmountable difficulty in 
agreeing upon a round or “cycle” in elementary science 
teaching adaptable in practice to all secondary school 
180
-P-A-G-E-193
  PHASES OF SCIENCE TEACHING 
sciences and capable of being followed consistently year 
after year throughout school life. Its chief purpose 
is to establish in every pupil a mental attitude char- 
acteristically scientific, a right reaction habitually to 
life’s varied interests. In it there must be no undue 
amount of monotony caused by repetition of words 
from books, nor lack of variety in the teaching material 
used and in the manner of its presentation. There 
must be a never-ceasing demand for constructive think- 
ing, and for sustained efforts to gather and relate 
thought material, as well as for testing by application 
the validity of all conclusions reached. 
A striking similarity appears between the procedure 
followed in moral education and in elementary science. 
Certain general principles of science teaching are es- 
pecially applicable in the twin phases of moral instruc- 
tion and moral training. The difficulties inherent both 
in the content of the course and in the normal reac- 
tions of youth to ethical teachings are many; but they 
are not at all insurmountable as may be noted below: 
Public school instruction in morals involves a 
knowledge content much of which is already known to 
pupils intuitively.1 There is required the same kind 
*Instinct may be defined in a general way as the knowledge and 
intellectual capacity possessed by animals without its ever having 
been learned or developed through experience,—an ability to 
“react” to situations which represents inherited tendencies. In- 
tuition on the other hand involves a nearly automatic and highly 
efficient use of knowledge which has been acquired; but this ac- 
quisition has been more or less unconscious, and wholly apart from 
formal instruction. Education should avail itself of both instinct 
and intuition; and it should seek to clarify and enlarge upon, and 
to give suitable means of expression for them. 
181
-P-A-G-E-194
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
of skilled instruction as found necessary in connection 
with the “Introductory Discussions” of the cycle of 
elementary science teaching (p. 118). Under guidance 
of the instructor the knowledge of individual pupils 
concerning moral standards is assembled, clarified, and 
by means of contributions of the instructor organized 
into a well-defined class consciousness so that what was 
before vague, scattered, and unusable information now 
becomes available for specific applications in life situa- 
tions. Right motives for its use, too, are furnished. 
It is to be emphasized in this connection that whatever 
to pupils savors of “pious talk,” or of “preaching,” is 
a hindrance to and may defeat the instructional 
ends. 
In public schools the teaching of morals must be 
largely done indirectly. Nowhere can the teacher 
safely assume to be a final authority and undertake 
to override dissenting views by force of will or power 
of position. It is the instructor’s province to render 
assistance to pupils so that they themselves arrive at 
valid conclusions by expeditious courses of reasoning. 
It is the pupil himself, however, who must reach these 
conclusions. There is a marked similarity in this to 
the second stage of the teaching cycle in elementary 
science. Use of wisely chosen exercises recalls first- 
hand information gained in life’s experiences as facts 
of observation. Through relationships as inferences es- 
tablished among these facts, conclusions are eventually 
reached for guidance in conduct. Formulating and 
182 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
PHASES OF SCIENCE TEACHING 
suitably phrasing these conclusions much after the 
manner of a laboratory “write-up,” recasting them as 
necessary in order to make them “fit the facts” of 
human experience and of life conditions, completes the 
instructional phase of moral education. The applica- 
tion of these conclusions to personal life experiences 
characterizes a period of moral training whose aim is 
character formation. 
As illustration of a teaching “cycle” specifically 
adapted to moral education, embracing both the in- 
structional and the applied or training phases, there 
is given here with brief comments the outline of a 
lesson on the “Rule of Life” successfully employed by 
another,? and well adapted to the specific ends set 
forth above.

Let it be required that two points some distance 
apart on the blackboard shall be connected by a straight 
line. Let efforts to do this be made at first freehand, 
and then by use of a foot-rule or yardstick as a guide 
in making the desired line.

(b) as found in books on games, etiquette, parliament- 
ary procedure, etc. 
Purpose of rules for use in life affairs such as in busi- 
ness matters, in social behavior, or conduct in general. 
The shortest rule of conduct ever heard. (“Do right.’’) 
Where first heard and employed? Where else? Occa- 
sion for its use in school, and for how much of the 
time. Use of it in control of one’s speech, and of one’s 
thoughts. 
Results of use of the foot-rule or yardstick as an aid 
in drawing straight lines if held in one hand while 
drawing, and merely looked at from time to time. 
Distinction as to conduct between a “crook,” and a 
straight-forward man. One explanation for the differ- 
ence. Distinction between laws in civil life and in 
social customs. Distinctions (a) between “moral laws” 
and civil statutes; (b) between the “laws of nature,” 
and “laws of science,” and “moral laws.” Purpose of all 
rules and regulations in connection with school life 
whether for classroom, laboratory, or the school 
grounds. When changed, and why? 
Number of rules necessary when living the right kind 
of lives. Number of rules necessary in school life. Why 
so many regulations? Danger in having too many 
rules.

“change seats” because of whispering or other dis- 
order? What force has the plea “He got me to do it”? 
8. Name some results in affairs of men if for the rule 
“Do right” there was substituted “Do whatever you 
please.” 
PERIOD OF APPLICATION AS A TRAINING IN MORALS 
[Pertinent queries at opportune times, generally as 
suggestions quietly made and as a purely personal mat- 
ter: Have you your “rule” with you to-day? What 
rule should be used here? (Applicable equally well to 
185

  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
cases of behavior, speech, or thought.) When are you 
going to begin use of your rule? You do not seem to 
be making use of your rule—why not? Why plan for 
yourself a crooked life? How only is a straightfor- 
ward life possible?] 
For those who are stubborn or who are possessed of 
perverted moral views, and especially in cases of the 
smaller misdemeanors requiring personal interviews in 
the “principal’s office,” there is necessary: (a) a full 
and frank understanding, and a statement in writing, 
of the main facts involved in the situation; (b) oppor- 
tunity for the pupil to convince the teacher that his 
conduct (or his speech, or his line of thinking) is 
straight “according to rule,’ and “on the square”; (c) 
fullest freedom accorded a pupil for presentation of his 
case free of interference or argument by the teacher.’ 
Attention is to be called to the fact that the 
standards of children and youth lack the distinctions 
and definiteness which are the natural results of more 
mature years. To “play fair” in all things may be a 
wholly satisfying demand to them, and one which may 
not discern or take under consideration any aspects for 
good or ill beyond the immediate issues involved. Then, 
too, the forcefulness of the old adage that “Example 
is better than precept” is manifest in the ready dis- 
cernment of, and the biting comments by pupils upon,

place here, are placed in the Appendix.

any delinquencies of teachers whether fancied or real. 
Pupils are keen observers of conduct by teachers, better 
observers in matters of conduct than they are, it may 
be, in studies of experiments. “It behooves a teacher 
to be fair and just in all relationships, outspoken for 
what is decent and right, and at no time petty, mean, 
or malicious. No demand on teachers is more unre- 
lenting and insistent than that they not only do what is 
right,’but that to the extent of their influence they 
“make things right.”

CHAPTER XVII 
THE STATUS OF HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE, WITH ESPECIAL 
REFERENCE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH SCHOOLS 
In 1860 there were perhaps forty high schools in the 
country; in 1870, seventy of them; ? in 1890, two 
thousand five hundred; in 1910, twelve thousand; and 
now (1925), possibly eighteen thousand. From 1890 
there has been an average increase in the number of 
high schools of more than one for every calendar day 
—a new high school a day for thirty five years. The 
number of high school pupils in 1890 reported was 
202,000; in 1918, the number was 1,645,000.2 In this 
same connection it is noted, too, that of these high 
schools about two-thirds of them have an enrollment 
each of 75 pupils or less, while but 5% of them enroll 
over 500 pupils each. Thus the “high school problem” 
is essentially one of the smaller came than of the very 
large high schools. 
The growth in high school attendance in this country 
in the past fifty years is a marvel in educational his- 
tory difficult of full comprehension by those actively 
participating in its realization. Promoted by legal

requirements, and fostered by the spirit and genius of 
our form of government and the economic prosperity 
of the nation, a generally higher educational level has 
been demanded by a 20th century civilization. It 
would seem that almost in a single generation all Amer- 
ican boys and girls began going to high school. YA 
high school graduation now counts as the minimum of 
schooling to be furnished at public expense to fit for 
citizenship. 
To provide buildings and equipment to care for these 
throngs who crowded into the high schools, communi- 
ties taxed themselves to the limit and imposed taxa- 
tion burdens upon generations then unborn. School 
administration officials throughout this period were as 
a class kept in a state of mind bordering on frenzy to 
care suitably for these boys and girls who clamored for 
admission and instruction. “There was need to frame 
and remake curricula again and again to meet the 
wide range of desires in different fields of learning. 
All sorts of substitutions and electives were provided 
to give flexibility to these high school courses, and to 
provide such an “appeal” to pupils that all would re- 
main in school to graduate. A curriculum was neces- 
sary which should make it possible to move onward 
with machine-like certainty these masses of boys and 
girls that they in turn might make room for others. 
Local pride in a big high school crowded to the limit, 
together with a more or less pardonable pride on the 
part of superintendents and principals concerned over 
190
-P-A-G-E-203
  
THE STATUS OF HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE 
their professional standing and their advancement in 
the affairs of school administration, likewise entered in 
as factors in a hectic period of school development. 
With costs of the public schools reaching appalling 
sums, a system of “cost-accounting” per pupil brought 
notably to light various facts in connection with the 
teaching of science subjects in contrast with other 
branches in a high school curriculum. Science teachers 
demanded for the successful teaching of their subjects 
what was considered an undue allotment of their own 
time and that of their pupils—seven hours per week 
at least in classroom and laboratory rather than five. 
Then small groups only could be handled advantage- 
ously thus multiplying sections in any one course, and 
keeping down the numbers of pupils per week in the 
classes of a science teacher. Fewer classes per day 
could be assigned a science teacher owing to time re- 
quired to prepare for laboratory exercises, and then to 
clear away after the experiments. Then, too, the ex- 
pense of installation and upkeep for science teaching 
presented conditions where without doubt “money 
talks.” 
‘That the science instructor might carry the same 
teaching load as others on the teaching staff, labora- 
tory work had to be cut to a minimum or eliminated. 
Texts were sought which in an interesting and more 
or less instructive manner told of the marvels of sci- 
ence, and the usefulness of its applications. Substi- 
tutions and “electives” permitted students to go 
191 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
through high school with no science whatever, thus 
solving happily the problems of administration cen- 
tering in the science work. To lighten the load of over- 
taxed science teachers in the smaller high schools es- 
pecially, science subjects were parcelled out one sub- 
ject here and another there to instructors in other 
fields of high school work, and this without particular 
regard at times to any preparation or fitness for such 
science teaching. The immediate end sought was to 
equalize teaching loads. The teacher of French might 
get a class in botany though her sole knowledge of the 
latter subject was perchance a five hour course in col- 
lege taken as a “group requirement.” The physics 
might go to the coach in athletics to give him some- 
thing to do when not busy with training his teams, or 
otherwise employed in connection with athletics. His 
tenure of position, his salary, and his success or failure 
in the field of secondary education would be in ath- 
letics and not in science. General science not infre- 
quently has been turned over to any one who had time 
for it, and who did not protest sufficiently an unfitness 
for teaching it. 
That such conditions affecting the integrity and very 
existence of suitable science instruction in high schools 
may not as yet have become the rule in that two-thirds 
of the high schools of the country enrolling 75 pupils 
or less each, is not to any notable extent to be credited 
to any group-consciousness on the part of science teach- 
ers, and of organizations of science teachers. That it 
192
-P-A-G-E-205
THE STATUS OF HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE 
may become even more common in spite of efforts by 
science workers is very possible. School administra- 
tors will continue to point to a high-cost-per-pupil-in- 
structed in science as compared with cost of instruc- 
tion in other high school subjects. They will demand 
evidence other than claims made by science teachers 
of the superior educational values from science instruc- 
tion. Thus it will be no easy matter to regain and 
retain the old-time prominence of science in high school 
curricula, and in the minds,of high school pupils and 
of school administrators. “Surveys” of teaching effi- 
ciency in the sciences must compare favorably with re- 
sults of instruction in other branches. 
And in this connection, too, it will be found of little. 
purpose to undertake to point out to young men and 
young women who in college courses show marked na- 
tive aptitude and tastes for teaching, and whose 
scholastic attainments and aspirations single them out 
as promising teacher-candidates, their need for teacher- 
training, and any call to them for service as science 
teachers in secondary schools. From their own observa- 
tions and experiences as high school pupils they are 
well acquainted with conditions likely to confront them 
when seeking positions as high school science teachers. 
Educators generally, and science teachers in particu- 
lar, have for years deplored the passing from schools of 
a spirit among pupils which was in evidence to a 
marked degree in the earlier days of science teaching. 
In the old-time academies of the eastern states, and 
193 
   
-P-A-G-E-206
TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
into the first of the period of development of high 
schools, the pupils in school looked forward to a time 
when older grown they, too, might be in the class in 
natural philosophy and be taught concerning the things 
of science. 
It is true that college classrooms and laboratories to- . 
day are so congested by students as to make it difficult 
to care suitably for them by reason of their numbers. 
In an all too large degree, however, this is but a result 
of the group requirements for college graduation, and 
is in no sense evidence of any thirst for knowledge in 
the realm of science. Any acquisition of scientific 
attitudes of mind, and of scientific procedure in thought 
processes in those surviving such required freshmen 
courses in science, are not notably in evidence. It is 
true that in this day and age people generally are ac- 
quainted with the uses of electrical devices for their 
comfort and welfare. They spend much time in run- 
ning about the world on wheels, and supposedly know 
something of conditions necessary that these wheels 
may be kept running. They may travel by airplane or 
submarine, and get information and enjoyment by 
radio, but all this in no way establishes the fact that 
use of these achievements in applied science arouses 
any spirit of inquiry, or stimulates in any sufficient 
degree for educational valuation intellectual growth 
and mental attainments. 
~ In connection with the status of science in the high 
schools of to-day is one dominant need—the need to 
194  
-P-A-G-E-207
  THE STATUS OF HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE 
regain and better the former standing of science sub- 
jects in high schools as part of a connected line of 
well-related and properly organized science instruc- 
tion, and to‘have this place taken for granted even as 
in the case of languages, mathematics and social sci- 
ences. Elsewhere throughout this book there has been 
stressed the importance in education of science instruc- 
tion when given by those who have both “vision” and 
fitness to instruct. All such possibilities may be to 
little purpose, however, by reason of conditions over 
which science teachers, and those interested in the pro- 
motion of education by means of science studies, may 
wholly lack all control. In contrast with discussions 
of the dismemberment of science work in high schools, 
its lack of continuity and proper sequence and its sub- 
ordination to other fields of major interest to high 
school teachers, it is of little moment to become 
wrought up over whether much or little notebook work 
shall be required of pupils in science classes; and 
whether or not much in the way of quantitative ex- 
periments shall be demanded in a high school course 
in physics. 
In this same connection, too, and of large moment 
as a factor in the situation, is the certification of sci- 
ence teachers. As licenses to engage in teaching, these 
certificates are granted by teacher-training institutions 
and by public school officials under authority of law. 
Wide variations in requirements for certification exist 
in different states, and laws governing issuance of cer- 
195 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
    TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
tificates to teachers are ever being changed in all the 
states. In general, however, certificates are granted 
for Elementary Schools and for High Schools rather 
than for certain lines of work such as science, English, 
or mathematics. The holder of a high school certificate 
is then by virtue of such certification entitled to en- 
gage in the teaching of any and all of the high school 
branches however unprepared in subject matter. That 
science teaching suffers and may be made a farce, need 
not be argued. While superintendents rest satisfied 
with this grouping of teacher’s certificates by reason 
of their particular interests in the grades below high 
school, and while principals of the large high schools 
can control the situation by reason of special teachers 
for the several science branches, it is in that two-thirds 
group of the high schools—those of the small enroll- 
ments—where science teaching experiences the harm 
from lack of qualifications on the part of teachers other 
than such as entitle the holder of a certificate to teach 
any high school subject. 
Colleges and universities, getting in their student 
body the product of instruction given in high schools, 
can scarcely remain uninterested spectators of such 
situations so far as science instruction goes. It is not 
so much a question of whether or not pupils come from 
high schools with or without certain preparatory 
courses in science subjects. It is a question of whether 
or not they come fitted to undertake beginning courses 
in college science by reason of suitable training in high 
196
-P-A-G-E-209
THE STATUS OF HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE 
school science courses. It is not the subject matter 
of elementary phases of science, but whether these 
students have the attitude and spirit wherewith to 
catch step and lay hold upon instruction in science 
courses supposedly suited to college freshmen. 
There would be little purpose here to indulge in 
statistics concerning the extent to which conditions 
prevail whose existence imperil the possibilities of sci- 
ence in secondary schools. A mass of data has been 
gathered by independent investigators whose general 
purpose when summed up was to learn “What is the 
matter with science?” Much of this material is to 
be found in such publications as School Science and 
Mathematics. Much lies hidden away in findings on 
which have been based various “Theses” for advanced 
scholastic degrees, and none of it would be in place 
here. But in calling attention to these very general 
and more or less unsubstantiated claims concerning 
conditions which affect the educational values of sci- 
ence in high schools, both in the present and for the 
future, there is no intention to be unduly pessimistic. 
The authors are simply mindful of the famous remark 
attributed to Mark Twain with reference to the 
weather that “A great deal is said about it, but not 
much done.” ¥ For certainly not much has been done 
by science teachers themselves to meet and master the 
problem of control over conditions vitally affecting 
secondary school science as an accompaniment of high 
school development in the past half century. It is 
197
-P-A-G-E-210
TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
their mind that not to develop a class consciousness 
among those zealous in the cause of science instruction 
in the public schools, but instead to give over time and 
effort to heated controversies with other science teach- 
ers who may not agree exactly with one’s own views, 
is to fritter away a heritage of educational values in- 
herent in the matter and method of high school science 
when properly taught. 
As a closing word regarding the status of science 
teaching in high schools, it is in place to note certain 
requirements in the training of science teachers in 
Normal Schools and Teachers Colleges. There still 
persists in this general training for high school teachers 
what to those engaged in the field of secondary school 
science is wholly indefensible. To begin work in Edu- 
cation with a course in the history of educational sys- 
tems, whether of earlier or later periods, is not good 
pedagogy. It is the spirit of science teaching that 
classes of beginners be started in any new field with the 
organization and extension of what is already more or 
less well known to them, and preferably what is of 
their immediate experiences. Surely in this connection 
there would be any sufficient number of problems con- 
fronting one who seeks to enter upon teaching service. 
Included in such would be topics of special instruc- 
tional difficulty, as well as controls of teaching sit- 
uations. 
The authors do not have in mind in this connection 
the work done in graduate schools of education, nor 
198 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  THE STATUS OF HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE 
necessarily any courses undertaken by teachers of con- 
siderable experience. For such students an historical 
survey suitably provides a background into which may 
be fitted various advanced courses in education. But 
if within four years of college attendance (120 college 
hours) a student must make a major and minor in 
academic courses in science; must meet requirements 
in educational psychology, and in theory ‘and prin- 
ciples of education; must take courses in methods, both 
general and special; and must do enough of practice 
teaching to familiarize a beginner with difficulties in- 
herent in teaching as an art, then after having met 
various “group requirements” there is little oppor- 
tunity for anything else. Teacher preparation for high 
school sciences assuthes in no inconsiderable measure 
the aspects of vocational training. The authors con- 
ceive it true, whether in science or in education, that a 
working fund of concrete knowledge—the “known” as 
distinguished from the “unknown”—is a necessary 
foundation for theories in education even as in science, 
just as they are necessary for the beliefs and opinions 
cherished by men in all relationships of life. The cen- 
tral feature of teacher-training so far as science teach- 
ers are concerned, and apart from a mastery of subject 
matter indispensable to any teaching undertaken, are 
its demands that'in education courses for science teach- 
ers a laboratory basis is required just as truly as in 
the mastery of any of the natural sciences. They are 
mindful, too, that the day is remote when in the

  CHAPTER XVIII 
SCIENCE TEACHING BELOW THE HIGH SCHOOL AS 
NATURE STUDIES 
College courses in science may very properly have as 
their aim an effective presentation of knowledge in ac- 
cordance with the theories of the science concerned. 
The more detailed the facts, and the more exact the 
generalizations based on these facts, the better. The 
college instructor assumes on the part of his students 
both maturity of mind, and a purpose to master that 
which is presented in classroom and laboratory. A sub- 
jective treatment of topics dominates the teaching sit- 
uation. 
On the other hand, the amount of subject matter in 
nature study is small. Its treatment is objective. 
Theory is incidental, or is wholly unwarranted in the 
teaching procedure. The teaching “problem” is the 
child mind rather than knowledge organized in accord- 
ance with scientific theory. Teaching successes and 
teaching failures in nature studies should be considered 
as fundamentally a matter of teaching aptitude, and 
of versatility in knowledge of child nature and child- 
hood experiences. First-hand knowledge of the phe- 
nomena of the natural world on the part of a teacher, 
203
-P-A-G-E-216
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
and an ability to interpret these experiences in a vocab- 
ulary adapted to those under instruction, are dominant 
factors in successful nature teaching. It is true here 
as in teaching generally, of course, that one cannot 
teach what he himself does not know. But let it be 
strongly insisted upon that instruction in nature study 
must center in and be grouped about objects and phe- 
nomena of the natural world as these are being ob- 
served. Books about nature’s forms and phenomena 
may be used by the instructor for inspiration, and for 
definite and detailed information. For such pupils as 
may be able to read intelligently, books may be used 
as supplementary sources of information and of inter- 
pretation. However, nature study as an elementary 
school subject must ever be a first-hand study of na- 
ture’s works and ways in contrast with attempts to 
center these studies in what someone has said in books. 
Pictures, diagrams, mounted specimens and the like, 
however serviceable in nature teachings, are substitutes 
only. Word descriptions by the teacher or taken from 
books are valuable to the degree in which by compari- 
son with known and familiar objects they convey defi- 
nite concepts. 
In aptitude, in professional preparation, and in suc- 
cessful experience the teacher of nature study must be 
the peer of any in the teaching force. It is quite to 
the point to insist that apart from a relatively few 
exceptional cases of notable natural aptitude in teach- 
ing, those become efficient teachers only who have had 
204 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
SCIENCE TEACHING BELOW THE HIGH SCHOOL 
special training in the choice, adaptation, and objec- 
tive presentation for instructional ends of material 
suited for nature studies. And this preparation, too, 
must not ignore the common limitations in number and 
size of classes, and lack of supplies and room furnish- 
ings common to instruction in public school service. 
The methods of the kindergarten project themselves 
into presentations of nature lessons. Success in nature 
teaching, so it must be insisted upon, on the one hand 
involves less of knowledge in scientific fact and theory 
and applications, but on the other hand more of teach- 
ing principles applicable to the educational ends to be 
attained. The procedure followed in teaching must 
be of a character reasonably certain to assure the at- 
tainment of these ends. 
In the rise and fall of the nature study movement in 
this country a generation or more ago is to be seen an 
excellent illustration of the difficulty of maintaining in 
the public schools any subject the educational values 
of which depend so largely as does nature study upon 
superior qualifications of the teachers employed, and 
upon teaching excellence through ripened experience. 
Or, in other words, a school subject in which the use 
of textbooks is largely or wholly barred must by its 
very nature demand of teachers large natural aptitude 
and a suitable professional preparation. 
To many teachers of the present generation, nature 
study so far as the public schools are concerned may 
be scarcely more than a name. Yet any careful exam- 
205 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
ination of the literature of nature study during the 
last quarter of the past century and the first decade of 
the twentieth century arouses wonderment by reason 
of its volume and its pedagogical worth. 
Then, too, one does not need to look farther than 
through the pages of such a book as Scott’s Nature 
Study 1 to come to a realizing sense of the fact that 
the difficulty of the course lies not in its subject mat- 
ter, nor in any large degree in the selection and organi- 
zation of its material, but instead almost completely in 
its manner of presentation. It may be that there are 
nature enthusiasts who by reason of experience and 
tastes are so imbued with an enthusiasm for the natural 
surroundings of life that as teachers they score a great 
success even when they have not attended a training 
school. But for the rank and file of teachers, from 
kindergarten through primary and intermediate grades, 
the problem of preparation for nature study teaching 
is primarily a problem of insight into its spirit and pur- 
pose rather than of serious concern over subject matter. 
It is not the purpose of this chapter to enter upon 
any discussion of what this spirit is. Such books as 
that referred to above serve this purpose well, whether 
recent publications or not. But rather it is desired to 
incorporate in this connection some of the lessons used 
with classes of prospective teachers of nature study 
illustrative of an organization of lesson material to give 
help to busy grade teachers struggling with the prob- 
1 Nature Study: C. B. Scott (1900). D. C. Heath & Co. 
206
-P-A-G-E-219
SCIENCE TEACHING BELOW THE HIGH SCHOOL 
lems of making choices of material for use. Naturally 
such lessons must lend themselves to ready modifica- 
tion in order to be usable as needed with pupils either 
more advanced than the fourth and fifth grades, or 
younger. Each of these lessons is presented as a series 
of related topics, but it does not necessarily follow 
that the teacher may not take paragraphs from any 
one lesson, or may not arrange and rearrange the order 
of topics as teaching conditions warrant. Back of all 
other purposes, there has been in mind that the great- 
est service to be given in any such arrangement centers 
in its provision for objective instruction in relation to 
simple thought-provoking natural phenomena. Such 
studies in spirit and in procedure are not unlike, and 
may in fact be, a series of laboratory exercises. 
It is understood, of course, that use of books by the 
pupils in nature studies is largely if not wholly out of 
the question. Information gained by the children must 
be from first-hand observation of whatever object or 
phenomenon constitutes the central feature of the les- 
sons for the day. Such observation and inquiry di- 
rected at all times by the teacher necessarily yields 
knowledge fragmentary and not fully comprehended. 
This necessitates at all times such instruction on the 
part of the teacher in connecting and clarifying what 
the children themselves learn as observers as shall 
make the product complete within the teaching limi- 
tations. Such information furnished by the teacher 
while in accord with what is to be found in books must

-P-A-G-E-220
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER. 
if it is to yield the desired results be information gained 
in part at least by the teacher himself from nature’s 
own pages. 
No attempt is made to develop these lessons in de- 
tail. Teaching situations are so dependent upon 
teacher and pupils as “human factors,”’ and upon times 
and conditions of teaching, as to render this apparently 
unnecessary. Then, too, books of this kind are already 
available for teachers who feel the need of this guid- 
ance.? That there is little of inspiration in any mere 
outline of selected items of subject matter is fully ap- 
preciated. But so numerous are the demands made 
upon the time and strength of teachers apart from any 
need to make suitable selections of teaching material 
and to organize it for teaching purposes, that it is 
well to have at hand some such ready-prepared nature 
studies as those which follow. Out of a teacher’s own 
experiences in due time should come other lessons more 
or less original in form and content, and suited to the 
needs and tastes of the individual teacher. Modifica- 
tions of any lesson here given by the omission of any 
particular items, or of whole paragraphs, in order better 
to adapt the lessons to particular teaching conditions, 
is easily done as needed. The language employed in 
these lessons is of course the teacher’s. It is subject 
to such modifications when used with children as teach- 
ing conditions demand.

places? How account for this? What explanation for 
any swift and broken current (“rapids”)?

water? What was noted of the widths of the stream 
at different points? What relation had this to (a) the

Why so? Its usefulness for manufacturing (if any), 
and why so? Name other respects in which it is 
useful.

tion is apparent between steepness of slope and (a) 
crookedness of any channels cut by the flowing sur- 
face waters; (b) depths of the cuts.

what is included in the “water-shed” of the system. 
What is the meaning of (a) river basin; (b) river 
system? 
4, How much is included within the limits of a val- 
ley? How many slopes to it? How account for lack 
of streams in so many of the smaller valleys? What 
various names are given to very small valley forms? 
How account for their never having become larger? 
Account for the existence of valleys in general. How 
then may hills be often accounted for? Where hills 
of considerable height exist what may be supposed true 
of the nature of the material of which they are made 
up?

upon what factors does the rate of cutting depend; 
(b) which parts of the surface are more readily car- 
ried away? 
What significance in the muddiness of some surface 
waters? Under what conditions will this muddy water 
become clear? Why is it that streams made up of sur- 
face waters from the hillsides in some parts of the 
country are quite clear, and free from sediment? What 
of the fertility of those hillsides?

of the salt particles? 
6. Evaporate some of the salt solution to dryness. 
Taste any solid left. What is it? Let the rest of the

milk? 
8. Heat gently some water in a test tube. Where 
does the air that collects on the sides of the tube come 
from? (Bubbles of steam if formed could not persist 
in the water below boiling temperature.) Explain 
how this air was kept in the water. 
9. Lay a blotter down upon a drop of ink. What 
_is done to the ink by the blotter? How can this be? 
Since we say that water dissolves air, why not say

for some time; (b) when a wet piece of cloth is hung 
up exposed to the air? After some water has been 
boiled for a time in an open dish, what is true of the 
quantity of it? In all these cases what becomes of 
the water? 
At what temperatures does this vaporization of water 
go on most rapidly? Name other conditions that 
favor a rapid vaporization of water from the earth’s 
surface. Name several sources whence the supply of 
moisture in the air is maintained. Whence comes the 
heat? 
2. Over the mouth of a test tube in which water is

and extreme fall in temperature may cause no precipi- 
tation either of rain or snow? What is true of the 
general character of a region, and its fitness for habi- 
tation, where the atmosphere is commonly destitute of 
moisture? In regions that are far away from large

1. Put a long narrow lamp chimney down over a 
short lighted candle set in a dish containing a little 
water. Repeat several times, and state what occurs. 
Explain. 
Repeat these tests, having a partition of tin reach- 
ing down through the chimney at one side of the burn- 
ing candle. Hold an extinguished match that is still 
smoking at the top of the chimney first on one side of 
the tin and then on the other. Observe the smoke. 
Infer the significance of the behavior of the smoke. 
2. Let the teacher carefully melt a little potassium 
chlorate in a test tube, and then heat it till it bubbles. 
Observe the results as bits of match sticks are dropped 
into the hot liquid.® 
The gas oxygen is set free from the chlorate as re- 
sult of a chemical change, and the union of the oxygen 
with the wood is another chemical change. 
Infer concerning (a) the nature of combustion; (b) 
the composition of air that supports combustion of the 
candle. ’ 
The rusting of iron and the decay of vegetation are 
illustrations of oxidation. Why are these not com- 
monly considered cases of combustion? 
*By permission from Laboratory Lessons in General Science:

*It is a wise precaution to fold a strip of paper into several 
thicknesses and wrap it about the upper end of the test tube as a 
holder. If the tube be heated nearly to its full length at first, there 
will be less likelihood of breaking it as water from the crystals of 
the chlorate is driven off.

8. Into an evaporating dish, put a teaspoonful of 
gasoline. Bring to it a lighted splinter, and observe. 
Half fill another dish with kerosene, and test in like 
manner. Pour out all but a little of the kerosene, and 
warm slowly what is left, testing frequently with a 
lighted splinter held just above the dish. What is 
necessary for a flame from kerosene? 
4, Light a candle. After a moment extinguish it, 
and immediately hold a lighted match just above the 
wick. Repeat several times, noting whether the wick 
can be lighted when the flame is some distance from 
it. Infer how this is made possible, and what the flame 
of a candle really is. What conditions seem necessary 
for any flame? Name in order the steps in the igni- 
tion, and continued combustion, of a candle. 
5. Note the parts of a candle flame distinguished by 
color, and state their relation to the wick and to one 
another. Hold in the candle flame just above the 
wick the wood part of a match, withdrawing it after 
a moment to observe the positions of the charred 
parts with reference to parts of the flame. Repeat 
several times, and infer concerning the interior of 
the flame. 
Press down over the candle flame nearly to the wick 
a sheet of white paper. Withdraw it before the paper 
ignites, and observe the form of the charred portion. 
From several such attempts reach a conclusion as to 
the interior of the flame. 
Describe the parts of a candle flame as to nature

and form. Explain the persistence (a) of the inner 
cone; (b) of the wick. 
hy / 6. Put the tip of a blow-pipe into the inner cone of 
U, © athe candle flame, and by repeated trials cause the 
in yellow part of the flame to nearly disappear. Explain. 
/ Hold the inner edge of an evaporating dish in this 
blow-pipe flame for a moment. Then hold another 
part of its surface in the candle flame. Observe any 
deposit on the dish in either case, and infer its nature 
and source. Explain any variation in amount in the 
two cases. Give an explanation of the light-giving 
power of the yellow part of the candle flame. 
7. Hold a clean dry bottle mouth down over a 
burning candle, and look for any moisture (water) on 
the sides of the bottle. If it be assumed that there is 
no water in the candle material, how is its appearance 
in the bottle to be accounted for? 
Observe the effect on a lighted splinter when it is 
put down into the bottle that has just been held over 
the candle flame. Explain. Set the bottle aside with 
a cover on it. When it is cold put into it 10 ce. of 
lime-water, and shake. Any milky appearance of the 
lime-water is probably due to the presence in the bottle 
of a gas known as carbon dioxide. 
8. Breathe through a glass tube into 5 cc. of lime- 
water in a test tube till a marked change occurs in the 
lime-water. Explain its significance. What is indi- 
cated concerning processes within the body? Whence 
is derived (a) the oxygen; (b) the carbon? In what 
222

respects does this oxidation within the body differ from 
ordinary combustion? What significance has the fact 
that people in cold weather and in cold climates crave 
fatty foods? What is the normal temperature of the 
human body? 
9. What are signs of lack of oxygen in the air that 
we breathe? By what means other than respiration 
may the air of our rooms be robbed oi its oxygen? 
What provision does nature make to rid the air of 
carbon dioxide, and to restore oxygen to it?

CHAPTER XIX 
GENERAL SCIENCE 
In general science one of two well-defined general 
educational aims is likely to dominate the teaching 
procedure. The more clearly these aims are discerned 
and differentiated by anyone undertaking to teach 
general science, the more satisfactory will be the re- 
sults achieved. Frequently the choice is determined 
by school authorities, and at times without consulta- 
tion with teachers. In no small degree choices will be 
determined by teaching conditions. Also, almost in- 
evitably the day-by-day teachings in general science 
are colored if not dominated by whatever special prep- 
aration has been made by a teacher in this field, and by 
his natural aptitude with regard to inductive processes 
of teaching. 
That the educational values anticipated from an 
introduction of general science into the curricula of 
secondary schools may not have been attained is all 
too often traceable to the fact that it has been taught 
by those who lacked special fitness for teaching it. 
Such results are the sorry experiences alike for all 
subjects inadequately taught. General science no more 
than any other subject is a panacea for educational 
225 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
ills in secondary school instruction, neither is it less 
than other subjects “fool-proof” in its teaching. In a 
very large sense teachers of elementary science must 
be made.” “Method” to a very peculiar degree is a 
dominant factor in teaching general science. Success 
or failure in it in many cases undoubtedly may be 
charged against administrations whose choice of 
teachers has ignored natural fitness and special train- 
ing. Failures in teaching, too, are more likely to be 
on account of the mode of instruction than from dif- 
ficulties in subject matter employed. 
But the teaching of general science in many of the 
smaller high schools is likely to remain in the hands 
of instructors who for the most part lack adequate 
preparation for the very difficult task of teaching this 
subject, and who do not have any special fitness for 
teaching it. Some clear discernment, then, of possible 
ends to be attained will be of service here. Choice of 
a text and of a laboratory manual to be used, and all 
plans for shaping the routine of class management, 
should wait upon decisions concerning which of the 
aims set forth below shall control the instruction given. 
Changes in aim may be made at any time, of course, 
as suggested by results of teaching experiences pro- 
vided these changes are consistent with intelligent 
efforts for attaining educational results of largest 
worth. ‘ 
226 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
  GENERAL SCIENCE 
I. The General Science Course as an End in Itself 
Whether general science be taught for one semester, 
one year, or be continued through the three years of 
Junior High School grades, its subject matter may be 
so chosen and unified that its teachings can be con- 
sidered an end in and of themselves without reference 
to any later courses in science. In itself it may be 
considered as completing the science instruction of 
pupils whose schooling ends with the ninth grade. 
A dominating motive in any such course will natur- 
ally be to provide discussions centering in the varied 
interests of home and community insofar as these re- 
late to the teachings of science. These could very 
suitably be classed under the general heading “What 
Everyone Should Know.” The applications of scien- 
tific achievement in social and industrial affairs gen- 
erally will be stressed. Things of educational worth 
in science teaching, and which at the same time are 
“interesting” and “useful” though more or less un- 
related as units of information, become of primary 
importance. Scientific conceptions set forth in the 
relationships of phenomena, and in the abstractions of 
scientific theories, are subordinated or completely 
eliminated. . Experiments are introduced for illustra- 
tive purposes rather than to promote inquiry. Nor are 
these experiments chosen primarily to furnish train- 
ing in thought processes which are based on observed 
facts, and which are incited by attempts to interpret 
227 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
    TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
general truths through observations of typical phenom- 
ena. It is science teaching with the “science” left out. 
Nevertheless, its place in a curriculum is easily justi- 
fied, and it is both an interesting and a profitable 
course of instruction. 
In such a course the study of an automobile may be 
made, including along with instruction concerning 
names and adjustments of its parts and its various 
“controls” more or less discussion of the profound 
changes in social and economic affairs of men which 
have been brought to pass by its advent. Studies of 
radio, and of airplanes, and of a steam-threshing 
outfit on a western wheat farm, may be made highly 
profitable through employment of field trips and 
laboratory exercises in connection with information 
gained from instructors and use of books. There need 
be no teachings whatever in all this concerning the 
origin of soils, the physical conditions basic to an in- 
telligent soil tillage, the chemical and botanical rela- 
tionships involved in the growth of cereals, nor any- 
thing of the physics of soil and atmosphere affecting 
this growth. Nor is there need to mention the physics 
of internal combustion engines whether used in air- 
planes or in automobiles, nor any groupings of knowl- 
edge concerning electrical appliances in order to under- 
stand something of the generalizations of science in 
relation to electricity insofar as pupils in a class might 
be able to comprehend it. 
For reference readings in these courses publishers’ 
228
-P-A-G-E-241
GENERAL SCIENCE 
lists furnish a bewildering choice of stories about the 
things of science, but not necessarily at all scientific in 
manner of treatment of the topics. Rich in valuable 
information, and highly interesting to pupils when 
presented by enthusiastic teachers, there is a natural 
tendency for these courses to become non-scientific, 
and “popular.” Little is done in them, possibly, to 
establish mental attitudes and processes of acquiring 
and using information in ways characteristically scien- 
tific. A minimum of special preparation is required of 
a teacher for any such course, and no extended study 
of the different branches of science. Any of the texts 
on the market furnish content sufficient for a year’s 
course, especially when reference readings are freely 
used. 
II. General Science as a “Science” Course 
Using the same topics as before, possibly the same 
texts, a course in general science may be made to center 
in certain selected sets of “laboratory exercises.” These 
need not all be experimental in nature, but all require 
an interpretation of information a considerable portion 
of which has been gained first-hand. Of necessity such 
exercises must be simple in character, and should be 
chosen primarily for their teaching values in connec- 
tion with science. Usually most of the experiments 
should be performed by the instructor. Accompany- 
ing the experimental work, and interwoven with it, 
should be as much instruction concerning related 
229 
   
-P-A-G-E-242
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
worth while topics as the pupils can appropriate. The 
class period furnishes opportunity to carry out a 
“teacher’s project” (p. 71). The pupils already have 
much information more or less vague, it may be, where- 
with to interpret information now newly brought be- 
fore them. Teaching efforts should be shaped chiefly 
towards a grouping of knowledge in accordance with 
scientific generalizations, while little if any scientific 
theory is mentioned. In other words, there would 
seem to be no good reason why general science may 
not be considered a “science course,” sufficiently ele- 
mentary in content and in difficulties to conform to the 
state of mind of those under instruction, but in spirit 
and procedure strictly in accord with the teaching of 
all secondary school sciences. The teaching stages in 
presentation of topics may very well be those which are 
summarized in the chapter on Teaching Cycle (p. 118). 
The amount of information to be gained experiment- 
ally, and considered fundamental to the scientific worth 
of the course, involves relatively few facts as compared 
with the knowledge already possessed by pupils. Life 
experiences are now supplemented by what becomes 
available through books, but the content of these books 
is given significance by reason not only of these ex- 
periences but as well by the experiments witnessed. 
These experimental exercises in certain cases may be 
performed by the pupil. They provide much if not all 
of the new “thought material” needed. The science 
230  
-P-A-G-E-243
  GENERAL SCIENCE 
training lies in the manner of gathering and organizing 
the information possessed by pupils. 
The written work required like that in other science 
subjects on a laboratory basis includes drawings, 
mathematical calculations, tabulations, summaries, etc., 
and these laboratory papers are to be handled as in any 
other laboratory course. Use of a textbook accords 
with discussions of preceding chapters. In short, in- 
structors in general science are expected to be science 
teachers. They need to know in a rather general way 
much about secondary school science, especially the 
methods of teaching these science subjects. They need 
to be able successfully to select, adapt, and present 
topics from various sciences with a maximum of edu- 
cational worth when measured as scientific informa- 
tion and training, and suited always to the needs of the 
pupils under instruction. The text in its vocabulary, 
its brevity of statements, and in its balanced choice and 
discussion of topics, is indispensable as an aid to the 
instructor’s efforts, and to further initiative on the part 
of pupils. “Projects” as assignments for out-of-school 
efforts whether at home, in field, or factory are espe- 
cially serviceable as teaching instrumentalities in con- 
nection with general science. Like projects in all other 
connections, the value of the results from them will 
depend in no small measure upon their being care- 
fully planned in every detail, suitably supervised from 
beginning to completion, and particularly upon 
231
-P-A-G-E-244
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
whether or not pupils consider them as something 
worth doing well. 
The literature of general science is embarrassing by 
reason of its abundance. Scarcely a publishing house 
which does not have one or more texts in general 
science together with laboratory manuals of varied 
form and content. Current issues and bound volumes 
of General Science Quarterly (Salem, Mass.), and of 
School Science and Mathematics (Chicago) furnish 
discussions of greatest helpfulness to teachers on var- 
ious phases of this newly organized science subject. 
The apparatus and supplies needed depend, of course, 
upon choice of manual and text to be used. 
Summary

  CHAPTER XX 
BIOLOGY 
Following the period of introduction of laboratory 
work into the high schools and academies such as then 
existed in the United States (1870-1890), there were 
exploited in the high schools various specialized phases 
of science one after another through many years. Very 
commonly these were college courses of a somewhat 
diluted form, and taught with laboratory requirements 
much the same as in college science. Many of these 
science subjects had but a brief career. This “fumbling 
around” with science courses in high schools brought 
with it a train of evils, not least among them being 
more or less loss in the relative importance of science 
in high school curricula.1_ In the judgment of edu- 
cators very generally the teaching results of “science 
courses” were not at all satisfactory (pp. 191-198). 
Science in the public schools has lost ground in spite 
of an amazing world-progress in scientific achieve-

ments, and a marvelous development of applied phases 
of science in the every day affairs of men. Bacteri- 
ology with its profound influence upon the health, 
happiness, and prosperity of mankind has had its mar- 
velous development in less than two score years. 
Despite the acknowledged importance of animal 
studies as part of an educational scheme, zodlogy as a 
high school science has never attained more than a 
precarious hold in the high schools of the country. In 
nature study there have ever been lessons upon various 
forms of animal life, including extended courses in 
bird study. General science coming into the schools 
provided further work upon animal life. But all too 
commonly these studies of animals have never been 
satisfactory in their continuity or their unity. Human 
physiology, apart from lessons in health and hygiene, 
at times was kept in the curriculum by legislative en- 
actment. Here and there courses largely or wholly 
concerned with animal life were notably successful, 
especially in certain of the larger high schools as de- 
partmental work, and their success fully demonstrated 
the great educational value of these studies. 
Courses in biology as more recently introduced into 
high schools mark a notable step forward in the crys- 
tallization and standardization of high school bio- 
logical science. Years ago biology texts of great worth 
were available in high schools,? but these met no such

general favor as that which has prompted the publica- 
tion of the numerous texts and laboratory manuals re- 
cently coming upon the market. 
These older texts commonly had their content ar- 
ranged to give a half year to botany, and a half year 
to zodlogy, including in the latter some more or less 
detailed discussion of the human body. Little or no 
attempt was made to point out the numerous similari- 
ties in life principles notably prominent in plants and 
‘animals. There was an encyclopedic array of facts, 
more or less isolated, set before pupils. Lacking de- 
sire to acquire this information whose purpose was 
not clear, botany and zodlogy retained places as science 
courses in high schools for what they might yield in 
educational values, possibly, rather than what was 
attained. The newer texts present biological prin- 
ciples, functions, and activities. They employ as illus- 
trative material both plant and animal life. The em- 
phasis is placed upon the similarity in living things— 
upon their life histories and habits rather than upon 
classifications and structural studies. 
With the newly established one-year courses in biol- 
ogy there is projected further on into the high school 
curriculum the dominating idea of a more generalized 
(less specialized) science teaching, and a continuance 
upward through the tenth grade of the spirit and 
much of the method of nature study and of general 
science. 
These later biological studies are supposedly unit 
236 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
  BIOLOGY 
courses organized with reference to educational values 
rather than as fragments of courses in biological 
science. Mastery of botany, zodlogy, and physiology 
as sciences is left for college courses. Studies are made 
of plants and animals primarily to arouse, foster, and 
establish abiding interests in the living things found 
in the natural environment of those taught. A studied 
effort is made to provide as “thought material” suit- 
able information concerning living forms, and to pro- 
voke and sustain thought effort wholly worth while in 
itself. “Effort more particularly is directed towards the | 
establishment of a mental attitude characteristic: of | 
nature-students and to train boys and girls in scientific — 
ways of thought and investigation. 
All this has its particular significance in the spirit 
and procedure of science teachers themselves. Any 
rearrangement and reorganization of subject matter, 
any modification in its manner of presentation from 
the kind of instruction heretofore given in the differ- 
entiated biological subjects, is supposedly dominated 
by a clearly defined purpose on the part of the instruc- 
tor. This purpose is not to make the course neces- 
sarily in and of itself merely “interesting” to pupils, 
but instead that it constitute for them a means of edu- 
cational development. With subject matter of a course 
suitably chosen, any methods employed in presenting 
this matter, and any devices used whether original to 
the instructor or otherwise, are but means only to a 
fundamental teaching end—the cultivation of keenness 
237 
     
-P-A-G-E-250
    TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
of observation in pupils, and of intelligent interpreta- 
tion of the vitally important facts of biological science. 
Such is the spirit of generalized science teaching in 
contrast with highly specialized instruction in college 
courses. In no degree is there less need, however, on 
the part of instructors of a thoroughly unified as well 
as a general knowledge of biological science. For 
teaching uses, this knowledge must be definite though 
not technical, and so organized as to be available for 
concise and suitable modes of expression. Biology 
teachers must be grounded not only in the facts but as 
well in the theories concerning plant and animal life, 
including what has to do specifically with man himself. 
But in teaching high school pupils these biology 
courses are to be characterized by the endeavor in a 
larger measure than heretofore to teach children in 
contrast with teaching science.) Neither confusion of 
meanings, nor conflicts in opinion, need arise here. The 
distinction suggested is one of aim on the part of an 
instructor, and of emphasis suitably placed. Changes 
in names of subjects in a curriculum, and any shuffling 
of topics as regards their order of presentation in any 
science, is far from attaining the educational progress 
squght. 
Urnis reorganization of knowledge concerning plants 
and animals, including human physiology, groups its 
subject matter with reference to the life interests 
natural to children. New sources of information con- 
cerning the natural world are opened to them, and as 
238

  BIOLOGY 
well the great educational values inherent in the study 
of biological science) The admirable texts and labora- 
tory manuals now available to teachers of biology often 
may vary widely in choices of subject matter, and in 
their order of topics. But this merely furnishes 
teachers of biology a larger range of teaching material 
suitable in itself, and adaptable to their particular 
preferences./ There must be kept in mind at all times, - 
however, that responsibility rests upon an instructor 
to unify the topics chosen, whether this be the order 
of the text used or otherwise. A course if biology is 
not a matter of so many weeks of time, Ahi: instead 
it should be a definitely planned period of closely re- 
lated instruction and training.) It must be a course 
adapted to the capabilities of the children, too, and 
productive of that somewhat ill-defined but very real 
educational end “a scientific mind.” 
So abundant and well-suited for courses in high 
school biology are the laboratory exercises to be found 
in the numerous “Manuals” in biology now on the 
market, it would be to little purpose to include here 
any type-lessons such as suggested for use in other 
connections (pp. 209, 300). Order Lists of labora- 
tory apparatus and supplies will be governed by the 
experimental work determined upon, and must pro- 
vide for experiments by pupils and for demonstration 
experiments by the instructor. It may often be pos- 
sible to make arrangements for getting biological ma- 
terial direct from departments of botany and of zoél-

ogy in some nearby college or university at moderate 
cost, and when needed for class uses. 
Whether or not there be a fixed allotment of time, 
and certain days be specified for laboratory work to be 
carried on, the teaching of biology as of other high 
school sciences requires that there be enough labora- 
tory exercises to provide all needed first-hand infor- 
mation upon any topic. These experimental results 
serve as centers around which in turn instruction upon 
any topic is organized. Every laboratory exercise, 
whether with plants or with animals, must in order to 
justify its use yield an abundance of “thought ma- 
terial” both in its results obtained and by reason of 
conditions involved. Likewise, it must incite to sus- 
tained thought effort by reason of the challenge it 
makes to an observer to comprehend what occurs. 
Experiments are necessary in providing well-defined 
(not vague) ideas wherewith to understand both the 
teachings of the instructor and of the text. Too little 
of the possible teaching values in an experiment, in 
biological as in other high school sciences, is attained 
by any mere following of directions and the writing out 
of results gained. The maximum of instructional 
worth becomes possible when each exercise in turn has 
its educational possibilities exhausted by discussions 
of it while being carried out. 
\ te unity of ‘biology lies in its studies of living 
things, and the conditions under which life exists and 
is transmitted. It has to do with the nutrition, growth, 
240
-P-A-G-E-253
  BIOLOGY 
and structure of living things as well as the functions 
of their parts. All this is common to plants, animals, 
and the human body, but a wide range may exist in the 
different aspects of topics selected to form a unified 
course, Biology constitutes a science in and of itself 
rather’than a composite merely of various sciences. 
Its unification through life processes and products is 
much like the unity of topics in physics as these center 
in and are related to discussions of matter and energy. 
Biology, even as other high school sciences, can be 
so taught that its subject matter is a series of “prob- 
lems” for pupils to solve, and in these solutions the 
various steps of reflective thinking may be compassed. 
Determination of just what this subject matter shall 
be constitutes a teacher’s project (p. 71). In gen- 
eral, those biological principles which are of largest 
significance in life situations constitute the most suit- 
able material to bring to the attention of pupils for 
thoughtful consideration and mastery. For determina- 
tion of what such significant principles are the begin- 
ning teacher must needs rely largely upon selections 
made by textbook writers. Any modifications of the 
order of topics and content of a course to better fit 
local conditions, and the individual needs of pupils 
nd of teachers, need to wait upon experience. 
A common mistake in biology as in other science 
courses is an attempt on the part of a teacher to cover 
too many topics. The temptation is ever present, 
especially when following a syllabus, to give a sum- 
241

  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
marized logical presentation of the whole field without 
full realization till taught by sad experiences how 
little of the subject matter, and of inter-relationship: 
of ideas gained from it, immature students assimilate.’, 
It would seem wiser for best teaching results from high 
school courses to settle upon some few biological prin- 
ciples, those especially which are likely to be of large 
service during life in giving a better understanding of 
its biological aspects. These can be of a general rather 
than specialized nature, and their manner of presenta- 
tion psychological as opposed to the systematic and 
logical. The need for reviews of what has been taught, 
and of renewed discussions of topics long since passed 
over in class, at no time should degenerate into say- 
ing over again statements of the same facts in the 
same language. Always there may be used a different 
“approach” to the same biological principle, and a new 
set of idea-relationships to the end that the knowledge 
ained is unforgettable. 
The year’s course in biology may be planned as a 
group of well-defined units, each centering in some 
feature of outstanding importance likely to make an 
appeal to high school pupils} These instruction 
“anits” may include nutrition as a function both of 
plants and animals; respiration; reactions to stimuli, 
or nerve functioning; reproduction, and inheritance. 
Illustrations and discussions are to be from both plant 
“Dr. Downing’s range test on fundamental biological principles 
given to over one thousand students who had finished one year of 
biology was passed by 30 per cent of them only.

  BIOLOGY 
and animal kingdoms. Photosynthesis in plant growth 
can be related to teachings concerning energy in 
physics. Certain of these units lend themselves readily 
as projects in teaching, thus aiding pupils to make 
applications of their knowledge gained in schools to 
life situations. Knowledge of the life histories and 
habits of insects, including as it would studies of flies 
and of mosquitoes, readily finds application in a prob- 
lem for ridding a community of these insect pests. 
One unit may well be historical, thus giving opportu- 
nity for students to come to an appreciation of contri- 
butions made to human welfare by such a man as 
Pasteur. 
Methods and Equipment 
It is highly desirable to have the laboratory and 
classroom one and the same room for smaller high 
schools especially. For instructional purposes only 
the same may be true for all schools though adminis- 
trative needs in large high schools may dictate other- 
wise. Division of work in biology courses into lecture 
and laboratory periods is artificial and at its best waste- 
ful of teaching possibilities. The subject matter under 
discussion should determine whether time be spent 
with a class in individual experimentation, in demon- 
stration experiments, for study or for recitation. The 
advantage in use of the same room for all phases of 
science instruction lies in part in a possibility of change 
at any time from one of these aspects of instruction 
243
-P-A-G-E-256
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
to another as demanded bythe progress of the studies. 
Where the biology room has laboratory tables and 
supplies as well as blackboards, lecture table, and class- 
room seating, conditions are most favorable for effec- 
tive teaching. 
For immature minds periods every day rather than 
double periods two or three times a week are desirable. 
A saving of teaching effort accompanies not having to 
spend the first part of every period in recalling the 
work of two days past, or more, and it alone makes 
the five-day-a-week plan worth while. 
Equipment for biology teaching naturally is limited 
by funds available for the purpose. / But generally 
speaking, and from an instructional as well as eco- 
nomic standpoint, the outlay is small compared with 
what is required for physics and for chemistry. The 
large outlay very commonly made for compound micro- 
scopes enough for individual work by laboratory sec- 
tions in biology can, without serious limitations upon 
the worth of high school biology teaching, be largely 
dispensed with. There must be at least one good 
compound microscope for the instructor’s use and for 
demonstration purposes, and several of them are highly 
desirable. Where funds available are ample, a pro- 
jection microscope solves so many of the teaching dif- 
ficulties of high school biology as to warrant the outlay 
involved in its installation. The instructor then is 
assured that all pupils have seen what is being dis- 
244
-P-A-G-E-257
a 
  BIOLOGY 
cussed, and have all seen the same things pointed out 
to all of them simultaneously. Individual microscopic 
work then becomes of the nature of verification and 
extension of what has been learned by visual instruc- 
“tion, and from reference readings. 
Elimination of any extended use of compound mi- 
croscopes by pupils saves the time and energy used 
otherwise in cutting and mounting material for ob- 
servation. / It may be doubted whether high school 
pupils in general get large educational values from 
spending time, inexpert as these pupils necessarily are, 
in cutting sections which supposedly show what an 
instructor desires them to see. The conscientious high 
school pupil is likely to become nervously overwrought 
in getting what finally he may come to see; if not 
conscientious, he after a time learns to find in some 
textbook picture what he was supposed to see under 
the microscope. In both plant and animal dissections 
it is much the same. Time spent in amateurish butch- 
ery by high school pupils yields when carried through 
to its end specimens quite impossible of any satisfac- 
tory study. Discouragement, or dishonesty, is a likely 
outcome of these efforts. How much better is a 
demonstration by an instructor, perchance by using 
the projection microscope and prepared slides. Only 
when sufficiently expert to use profitably the time of a 
class for it, should an instructor make his dissections 
before the pupils. The full time and energy of pupils 
245
-P-A-G-E-258
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
is to be employed in getting an understanding of what 
is essential in these demonstrations, and through these 
an understanding of life principles. 
Studies made of relative values of instructional proc- 
esses in biology* show superiority for the lecture- 
demonstration method over individual laboratory work 
by pupils in teaching the principles of biology. Lec- 
ture demonstration work when well carried out estab- 
lishes better idea-relationships, and what is learned is 
better remembered. This is true more especially be- 
cause of the conditions of observation, and the “set- 
ting” given the particular facts sought through ob- 
servation. It is true here as in other high school 
science teaching that experimental work may be 
carried through by pupils who at the same time fail to 
grasp the significance of what was attained by it, and 
who fail to be stirred to thought effort by it. The goal 
in teaching is, of course, getting the maximum of in- 
structional value from the experimental work under- 
taken, and this is not necessarily proportional to the 
number of experiments worked. The same investiga- 
tions showed, too, that pupils prepared by a semester 
of lecture-demonstration method when put to individ- 
ual laboratory work were more successful in manipula- 
tion and in interpretation than were they who had been 
trained in individual laboratory work from the first.

for use requires no small amount of judgment and 
use of foresight on the part of an instructor.) The 
biology departments of large city schools may have 
material from the school greenhouse as needed, but 
teachers very generally must depend upon gleanings 
from fields and gardens, from homes and meat shops. 
Window boxes for plant growths and germination test- 
ings may be made in the manual training department. 
All glassware, including (it may be) an aquarium, to- 
gether with the apparatus found listed in catalogues of 
biological supplies and needed for laboratory exercises 
whether by pupils or instructor, involves no appalling 
expenditure. It may be desirable, and often will be 
necessary, to scatter these purchases over several years 
and buy in accordance with a definite plan for a final 
complete equipment. Supplies and apparatus if needed 
only occasionally may often be had from the physics 
d chemistry laboratories. 
(2 high school biology the value of a notebook de- 
nds largely upon the purposes and the persistency of 
an instructor. } A concise record kept by pupils of ex- 
perimental work observed, whether performed by the 
pupil himself or by the teacher, combined with state- 
ments concerning its purposes and the significance of 
the results obtained, is valuable even as in other science 
studies. It makes opportunities for scientific ways 
of thinking and for an expression in writing of the 
results of laboratory exercises. It is especially con- 
ducive to reflective thinking when the written work 
247
-P-A-G-E-260
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
follows a completed series of experiments. The orderly 
manner of making records of the conditions observed 
in experimental work, of the results obtained, and of 
the conclusions reached supposedly based upon facts 
known, tends towards the establishment of a scientific 
approach when solving problems other than in biology. 
Where the nature of exercises requires that drawings be 
made in order to make manifest whether or not pupils 
have gained the concepts desired, carefully labelled 
diagrams serve this purpose well. These do not take 
the time that artistic drawings require. The educa- 
tional worth of such drawings from pupils in general 
scarcely warrants any insistence upon more than dia- 
grams. Encouragement is at times to be given, of 
course, to pupils who manifestly possess talent for 
drawing. Such pupils should be content only with the 
best that they are able to do. These diagrams and 
drawings at all times are but means to an end rather 
than ends in themselves. In all thought expression 
thus graphically set forth, there should be the least 
outlay of time possible that is consistent with clearness 
of expression in the relationships of ideas gained in and 
by reason of the experimental work.

PHYSICS 
( No question arises in the teaching of high school 
hysics, as in the case of general science, whether or 
not it shall be taught as a science.\ It is taken for 
granted that its subject matter as selected for high 
school pupils should be organized and presented with 
reference to theories which account for, or, explain, 
physical phenomena. It is taken for granted, too, that 
there shall be experimental work as part of a high 
school physics course. But, there exists in the teach- 
ing of physics in general even as in the teaching of 
general science a distinct line of cleavage in the man- 
ner of its teaching, the importance of which is meas- 
ured by the grief it has occasioned pupils and teachers 
of physics alike. That this difference in teaching 
procedure arises from a purpose on the part of a 
teacher, which in itself may be more or less vague and 
ill-defined, makes its existence none the less real. (Jt is 
largely a question of fitting the subject to the compre- 
hension of pupils as opposed to an effort to make the 
pupils fit into a concise and therefore difficult presenta- 
tion of the theoretical and mathematical aspects of 
physics. In the one case the applications of physics

in the affairs of men are made matters of major inter- 
est along with interpretations of phenomena, both 
natural and experimental, introductory to generaliza- 
tions in terms of laws and theories. On the other 
hand, theory dominates the teachings, with sufficient 
applications of a mathematical and practical nature 
needed to convey the meaning of what is authorita- 
tively taught as the summation of man ’s present 
knowledge of physics. “The two methods of approach 
are suggested but not sufficiently described by reference 
to them as inductive and deductive, the two merging 
in due time into a single teaching “cycle” as pupils 
progress. 
All shades of opinion on the part of teachers of 
physics, and all degrees of adherence to either view- 
point, are to be found. Such extreme views find ex- 
pression at times as set forth in statements that from 
twenty to thirty per cent of high school pupils regis- 
tered in physics should not be expected to “pass,” and 
that these same pupils are of course likely to “hate” 
the subject of physics. In college physics instructors 
have been known to state an intention of “failing” a 
third of a class, thus making it apparent that the 
physics taken under them as instructors was no “snap 
course,” and making sure that high standards of teach- 
ing were maintained in their work at least. 
\ One method of presentation to beginners in physics 
is to take an attitude somewhat—the same as in the 
teaching of general science when taught on a labora-

-P-A-G-E-266
  TEACHING oy SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
tory basis. This j is the making of such choices and 
adaptations.of-subject matter, and “especially to have 
such manner of presentation of it, that every pupil in 
a class who puts forth a reasonable amount of effort 
shall be profited greatly, boys and girls alike, by a 
year’s study of high school physics. ‘Physics can be 
regarded as a foundation for other science studies not 
only in the sense that its phenomena as studied in 
relation to matter and energy are preliminary to and 
find their applications in other sciences, but because 
of its large possible training values in the establish- 
ment of scientific attitudes of mind, and a scientific 
manner of thinking. 
Differences of opinion exist, wholly honest and some- 
times very earnest, whether the teaching of high school 
physics shall be strictly scientific in its manner_of pre- 
sentation,er whether primarily the intellectual ad- 
vancement of pupils shall be sought even at the sacri- 
fice of more or less of its theoretical and mathematical 
aspects, “This involves decisions on the part of 
teachers whether or not it is desirable to make sus- 
tained efforts for developing and directing a “desire” 
(a) to know more both of the teachings of physics, 
and of science in general; (b) to learn as distinguished 
from a need to get “credits”; (c) to seek that knowl- 
edge which is valuable in life situations rather than 
mere information soon forgotten. ~ As viewed by pupils 
there are involved two considerations: (1) whether or 
not that which is taught has real worth to them; (2) 
252
-P-A-G-E-267
    
PHYSICS 
whether or not it is a means for attaining ends other 
than school grades, powerful as the immediate appeal 
of these may be. It involves, too, the question of 
shaping the physics teaching for the sake of educational 
values to all pupils who take the subject in contrast 
to efforts to maintain certain “standards” of what high 
school pupils should be expected to learn in a physics 
course. 
No divergencies of opinion held by teachers of 
physics in these matters need be occasion for heated 
arguments and antagonisms. The one time dominant 
place of physics among high school sciences to some 
extent has been sacrificed through lack of adjustment 
of conflicting opinions held by teachers of physics. 
During changes incident to the notable expansion of 
secondary school instruction taking place in the gen- 
eration now past, readjustments have occurred in the 
nature and relationships of high school subjects ma- 
terially affecting physics as one of these subjects. 
Especially has this been true concerning subjects in- 
cluded in high school curricula serving different groups 
of pupils, and various specific teaching ends. In these 
changes the relative importance of physics in high 
school courses has lessened. Courses in household 
physics even as in chemistry of the household have 
been organized. In and of themselves as high school 
sciences they are but makeshifts at best, however 
justifiable such courses may be under certain condi- 
tions of school instruction. The real issue is one of 
253
-P-A-G-E-268
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
teaching worth in general for a beginning course in 
high school physics leaving applications of it in en- 
gineering, home economics, agriculture, and other fields 
for later and perhaps for college courses. In nowise, 
however, does this preclude the largest possible use of 
whatever information of home and vocational nature 
pupils may have, nor of making applications of the 
teachings of a general course in physics in any field 
wherein it finds immediate and suitable application. 
This is but sound teaching procedure in general. So 
far as an elementary or beginning course in any high 
school science is concerned, no differentiation is re- 
quired for various groups of high school pupils. 
Where teachers as beginners have not become fixed 
in their views and ways of teaching secondary school 
physics, it would seem there should be special emphasis 
and insistent demand that physics like all other science 
subjects be taught for its educational worth. Espe- 
cially should this be the case in all teacher-training in- 
stitutions where physics teachers for the smaller high 
schools are likely to get whatever of special prepara- 
tion they may have for science teaching. As a science 
required of all high school pupils, any commanding 
place of physics among science subjects must depend 
_ upon indisputable evidence of its instructional worth. 
“The organization of a physics course must not be such 
that its presentation as “science” is at the expense of 
good pedagogy, and in disregard of educational prin- 
ciples founded upon accepted teachings in educational 
254
-P-A-G-E-269
PHYSICS 
psychology. Choices of texts, of manuals, of labora- 
tory experiment lists, and of the manner of use of ex- 
periments in connection with instruction given topic 
by topic, all wait upon determination of what domi- 
nates in any teaching procedure consistently followed. 
Much if not all of what has been said is equally appli- 
cable to large and small high schools alike. While 
many teachers of physics have taken no courses in 
education as such, and others may have specialized in 
physics preparatory to teaching it, without exception 
the single controlling aim for all teachers of physics 
whatever their preparation for teaching service should 
be the educational interests and welfare of their pupils. 
The situation is one in which the instructional efforts 
must not be diverted from the general good of all 
pupils to that of the few who later perchance may be- 
come masters in scientifi¢ achievement. Such is the 
genesis of public schools. ‘ Physics in secondary schools 
is for general educational ends rather than for making 
physicists. 
Much which has been said elsewhere of a general 
nature (See Laboratory Equipment, Place of Labora- 
tory Work, etc.), is as applicable to the teaching of 
physics as to other high school sciences. Mention has 
previously been made that teachers of experience do 
not need to be told their needs, and how these are best 
met. However, the teaching of physics is undertaken 
every year by those who are not only inexperienced 
but who at the same time are not especially well fitted 
255
-P-A-G-E-270
TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
for the attainment of desired teaching results. The 
suggestions which follow should be taken in connection 
with discussions previously given. Until by reason of 
successful teaching efforts a teacher has developed 
wholly satisfactory ways of his own, it is the part of 
wisdom to follow courses suggested by the experience 
of others. 
In a general way the time of a one year’s course in 
high school physics should be divided about equally 
between laboratory and classroom work. Three periods 
of class discussions and instruction, with two double 
periods given over to exercises of experimental nature, 
should suffice. Where a smaller amount of time is 
available for the subject, certain selected parts only 
should be studied rather than any necessarily super- 
ficial treatment of the whole subject. 
It is to be borne in mind that the expenditure of 
time and effort by a physics teacher in preparing for 
experimental demonstrations, and in conducting class 
exercises with laboratory work, is necessarily greater 
than that required for a recitation or lecture of the 
ordinary teaching type. In school programs a dif- 
ferentiation should be made between a teacher with 
demonstrations and laboratory equipment to prepare, 
and one who simply has subject matter to master. 
Especially is this true in schools where inadequate or 
defective equipment results in a heavy demand upon 
the time of a teacher in providing apparatus. One way 
of meeting these conditions is to assign fewer class 
256
-P-A-G-E-271
PHYSICS 
periods to a science teacher. In many schools, and in 
part because of these conditions, the sciences have been 
parcelled out among different members of the teaching 
force according to an ever shifting personnel, and as 
personal preferences may dictate. Distribution of the 
teaching load is thus accomplished at the cost (theo- 
retically at least) of a conservation of teaching effort 
possible when the “science” of a small high school is 
centered as a unit in one instructor, or in one depart- 
t. Physics in particular has suffered in this way. 
cas laboratory part of a course in physics should in- 
clude experiments of a quantitative nature. The best 
sources for these without doubt are the many excellent 
laboratory manuals in high school sage So far as 
possible every pupil should be thrown wholly upon 
his own individual efforts in working any quantitative 
experiment, and forced to rely upon his own judgment 
in the evaluation of results obtained. A certain few 
experiments may require group effort in securing de- 
sired data. 
Aside from qualitative experiments performed by 
the teacher, illustrating and enforcing the teachings of 
a class period, many simple experiments of a qualita- 
tive character should be performed by pupils them- 
selves preparatory to discussions of these topics in a 
next succeeding class period. In this way there is 
secured a very definite understanding of the meanings 
of terms employed by teacher and textbook, a, first- 
hand knowledge of phenomena to be brought under 
257 : 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
discussion in class, and an appreciative attitude to- 
ward whatever instruction is then given. Quantitative 
experiments may very properly follow class discussions 
as applications in general of instruction given. In 
making selections of these experiments such as are of 
“practical value” are preferable. Quantitative experi- 
ments lacking elements of precision in manipulations 
required, such as inclined plane, siphon, etc., should 
not be allowed to displace experiments of greater value 
as laboratory work. The metric system commonly 
should be used in all measurements, and decimal frac- 
tions in all calculations. Pupils should learn to think 
in and to make estimates of quantities in metric units 
and tenths of units. 
4 The classroom should be especially well lighted, and 
so seated that clear unobstructed views of what is being 
done at the lecture table may easily be had by every 
pupil. The lecture table should contain many drawers 
and compartments for supplies, and for storage of those 
smaller accessories so necessary to have at hand when 
giving demonstrations. The table should be provided, 
too, with water and a sink, and with gas and electric 
connections where these may be had. There should be 
curtains for darkening the room, and some device for 
reflecting sunlight from a south window across the 
lecture table. The top of the lecture table preferably 
should be somewhat lower than the level of the eyes 
of the pupils when seated in classroom. Rather large 
portraits of some few noted physicists on the walls of

the room are both instructive and inspiring. Abun- 
dance of the best of blackboards must be provided. 
\’ The laboratory when a separate room should be 
large and well-ventilated. ‘One and the same room 
can be used to excellent advantage for both class and 
laboratory uses when provided with long narrow table 
tops of substantial construction. These are supported 
preferably on iron pedestals with flaring bases fastened 
solidly to the floor. Light, strongly-built chairs may 
then be used for seats on the one side of the table only, 
the pupils all facing the instructor’s table. (See 
Appendix B.) 
Free wall space is desirable for suspension of appa- 
ratus to which pupils in turn may be sent. Bracket 
shelves on the walls are useful in many experiments 
when the building is free from serious jars. A water 
supply and sinks are essential in a physics laboratory, 
but not so many are needed as for chemistry. In 
modern school buildings these needs are carefully pro- 
vided for in the school architect’s plans. There should 
be cases for supplies and apparatus in the room when 
possible, otherwise in an adjoining storeroom. A small 
workbench and some few tools likely to be needed in 
construction and repairs may very profitably be pro- 
vided. A manual training department with its motor- 
driven lathe, drill-press, etc., serves many a need of the 
science teacher. 
Where classes are not large, and other conditions 
permit, a double period every day gives time for lesson 
259
-P-A-G-E-274
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
preparation under supervision as well as for laboratory 
and class work. A physics teacher then has a large 
degree of freedom in use of this time for experiments 
or other laboratory exercises, for class work, or for 
lesson preparation as may seem best with the work in 
hand. The same room may thus be used very satis- 
factorily for all phases of physics instruction,Ya case 
with reference books to be consulted at will by pupils 
becoming an essential part of the furnishings. 
For many of the experiments of a year’s course in 
high school physics simple apparatus for the instructor 
is quite as indispensable as the more elaborate and 
expensive instruments. Where funds are not ample, 
apparatus of the simplest kind should be secured 
rather than some few costly pieces; but at no time 
should its effectiveness be sacrificed for cheapness. All 
apparatus purchased should give reasonably reliable 
quantitative results. There should be no lack of glass 
tubing, rubber tubing, rubber stoppers, files, clamps, 
ringstands, test tubes, flasks, metric rules, wire, ther- 
mometers, etc. In general, the equipment required is 
of two sorts: (1) apparatus for classroom demonstra- 
tions using experiments of qualitative character in 
connection with class instruction; (2) apparatus for 
individual laboratory practice by pupils in order to 
provide them training in manipulation, to develop 
habits of precision and accuracy, and to secure an in- 
telligent observation of phenomena presented before 
them. A wise expenditure of one or two hundred 
260
-P-A-G-E-275
PHYSICS 
dollars for use in the physics teaching of smaller high 
schools goes far towards providing a satisfactory work- 
ing outfit to begin with. A small annual outlay should 
then be made for permanent equipment. In placing 
orders for supplies and apparatus a catalogue of some 
reputable supply house is indispensable. Its cuts, de- 
scriptions of articles, and range of choices as indicated 
in part by prices listed, secures a better assortment of 
what is needed for any course settled upon, and lessens 
likelihood of mistakes and disappointments from orders 
filled. In general it marks the difference between a 
judicious expenditure of funds, and a haphazard frit- 
tering away of opportunities to get the most for any 
outlays made. It might be added, too, that when in 
doubt concerning items to be ordered the advice of 
teachers of experience in ordering might profitably be 
sought and heeded. Much apparatus suited for labora- 
tory uses, especially electrical supplies, is oftentimes 
most satisfactorily purchased through the regular 
“trade,” thus getting commercial instruments built for 
industrial uses. Appearance at times may well be 
sacrificed for utility. If, for example, a “blow-torch” 
be needed in laboratory uses it may be well to order 
it through a hardware house handling plumber’s 
supplies. The necessity amounting to an imperative 
need that suitable cases for storage of apparatus be 
provided has been mentioned elsewhere (p. 40). 
These cases must be kept locked when apparatus is in 
place. The wastage of moneys invested in laboratory 
261

supplies and apparatus permitted by some teachers is 
occasion for much of the limitations in these respects 
experienced by their successors.

( I. Its Teaching in General 
So striking and even fascinating are many chemical 
phenomena suited to studies in elementary science, 
and so numerous and important are the chemical 
changes of all sorts in everyday experiences of life, 
that at first thought it would seem that ‘chemistry 
should be found in all high school curricula. Attempts 
to maintain such courses are, however, not always so 
successful as might be desired./ Where these failures 
have been chiefly or wholly due to employment of 
teachers unfitted for what they undertook, the remedy 
is obvious. Nowhere sooner than in high school 
chemistry does teaching incapacity become more 
quickly and strikingly apparent whether due to lack of 
mastery of the subject matter, inability to adapt what 
is known to the needs of pupils taking the course, or 
incapacity for laboratory administration. Then, too, 
the best of teachers in high school chemistry must not 
be expected to accomplish the results desired with in- 
adequate equipment, impossible room conditions and 
lack of maintenance.

  CHEMISTRY 
The prominence of chemistry in connection with the 
Great War attracted the attention of the public, ‘There 
has been increase in the number of students taking 
chemistry, notably so in college courses. The demand 
is insistent that instruction given in high school chem- 
istry be of a manifestly high order. While very few of 
those beginning the study of chemistry will follow it 
vocationally, its educational values are so great for high 
school pupils as to warrant extended consideration of 
the difficulties attendant upon teaching it, and more 
especially so where in high schools the teaching condi- 
tions are more or less unfavorable. 
Among pupils entering upon the study of chemistry 
there is in evidence at times a desire to “fool around” 
with chemicals and laboratory apparatus “just to see 
what happens.” Perchance one may stumble upon a 
great discovery! Discernment of the purposes of a 
high school course in chemistry is lacking. It is not 
clearly understood that the wonderful achievements in 
chemistry, together with what is being done and what 
is hoped for in promoting the welfare of man, comes 
only at the conclusion and not at the beginning of 
courses in chemistry. Vague and extravagant notions 
on the part of pupils of the entertainment and free- 
dom to be enjoyed in a course in chemistry later prove 
stumbling blocks in the instructional processes. Wan- 
ing interest and cessation of efforts follow inevitably 
when the fallacy of these notions becomes apparent. 
Procedure with regard to choices and uses of labora- 
265
-P-A-G-E-282
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
tory manuals and texts, conduct of laboratory work, 
and teachings of theory from facts gained by observa- 
tion, are discussed elsewhere, and generally in ways 
especially applicable to chemistry. The transition in 
science teaching from laboratory exercises in the hands 
of the teacher only, to laboratory work carried on by 
pupils individually, becomes complete in high school 
chemistry by reason of the ages of pupils as well as 
the nature of the experimental exercises. In making 
choices of experiments primary consideration of neces- 
sity is given phenomena which furnish the teaching 
situations needed. Otherwise, choices should have 
local and industrial relationships since these furnish 
subject matter of interest to pupils. More particu- 
larly, the facts under discussion should be such as lend 
themselves later to organization through use of the 
theories of chemistry. In all the earlier stages of a 
beginner’s course, and through the first semester at 
least, it must not be forgotten that the terms employed 
make chemistry a study of a new language. 
When facts enough have been accumulated to justify 
it, then and not till then is it best to enter upon dis- 
cussions of any chemical theory by use of which to 
group, or “explain,” the facts at hand and all other 
facts of like nature subsequently acquired. As in the 
study of other high school sciences, the value of chem- 
istry is to be judged by its worth educationally, not 
by the amount of subject matter mastered. “It offers 
unexcelled values in the training of pupils in scientific 
266 :
-P-A-G-E-283
CO Te rT Te nT Tee ene reer eae 
CHEMISTRY 
methods. The best of these values for chemistry 
centers in that habitual reaction of mind which de- 
mands that all needed knowledge available be sum- 
moned and judiciously applied to the solution of the 
innumerable “problems” arising in connection with the | 
routine of instruction in the subject. 
To secure the best teaching results with a beginning 
ass, it is advisable to avoid attempts to cover an 
undue amount of the vast fund of information avail- 
able even when suited to an elementary course in 
chemistry. \ This is applicable especially to the de- 
scriptive portions of the various topics included in a 
course. Texts and manuals commonly furnish more 
material than can be covered adequately in a year’s 
time by beginners. Selections of material to use, and 
the amount of time for class and laboratory work, must 
take into account primarily the abilities of the pupils in 
the class, together with the conditions under which 
instruction must be given. No large measure of judg- 
ment is required, especially when based upon some 
teaching experience, to adapt a chemistry course to 
teaching situations. It is necessary, of course, to main- 
tain the natural relationships of topics to one another, 
and to the interests of those being taught, and none of 
the fundamentals of a beginning course should be   omitted. 
(rive double periods per week are highly desirable 
for high school chemistry whenever this is possible. 
Practically no home work then is made necessary. All 
267
-P-A-G-E-284
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
laboratory work carried on by pupils should always be 
in double periods. Strict adherence to alternation of 
class and laboratory work is co) The best 
of teaching results may oftentimes be had by continu- 
ing for a week at a time, it may be, either laboratory 
or class work. Classroom conditions should be such 
that demonstration experiments are possible at any 
time. 
The manner of instruction for the first weeks of the 
course is vital to success. The inferences which con- 
stitute so large a part of the teachings based on labora- 
tory exercises are difficult for high school pupils. Es- 
pecially is this the case when they have not had an 
excellent preliminary training in arriving inductively 
at judgments of their own based on observations made 
by themselves. The language of chemistry, its formu- 
le and its equations, easily bewilder pupils when work- 
ing at their best. Textbooks in high school chemistry 
in their first chapters commonly fail to furnish pupils 
the assistance so greatly needed by beginners. In 
many cases these books are good illustrations of how 
not to start'a course. A systematic presentation of 
topics suitable for college students seems to presup- 
pose on the part of beginners in high school chemistry 
ability they do not have for the comprehension of 
chemical changes, and a clear discernment of the con- 
trolling conditions in these changes. Even instruction 
given by teachers of superior ability in nowise makes 
268
-P-A-G-E-285
CHEMISTRY 
the textbook in and of itself any less indispensable at 
this most critical period of the course. 
‘The text is for the pupils. It is to be referred to 
over and over again (“studied”) by them when in need 
of detailed information concerning what is but slowly 
comprehended. It\supplements and clarifies what 
the instructor can do for them, and furnishes back- 
ground and purpose for the laboratory requirements. 
The inclusion in modern texts in high school chemistry 
of the many things “new in chemistry” has resulted at 
times in an omission of those beginning discussions of 
processes and studies of chemical phenomena simple 
of interpretation and fruitful of instructional oppor- 
tunities. Authors of chemistry texts seem of one 
accord in considering these as having no place in the 
study of chemistry, not permissible even in a “first 
course” in chemistry. 
The lesson on Combustion (p. 220) may belong in 
general science, but it is suggestive of one manner of 
approach to a study of oxygen, beginning in the realm 
of the “known.” In it there is a presentation to pupils 
of one difficulty at a time. Where pupils are capable 
of going more rapidly to more difficult and involved 
studies, it could of course go unused. It employs as 
material for thought a fund of knowledge which the 
pupils may be presumed to possess by reason of their 
experiences in life. In a study of the oxidation of iron, 
or other metal, the pupil under guidance may learn 
269
-P-A-G-E-286
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
for himself that a gain in weight results; that air sur- 
rounding the metal loses in volume, not all the air 
participating in the change; that the active part of air 
constitutes about one-fifth of the whole volume; and 
that this part long ago received the name oxygen. In 
some such natural way let the beginner in chemistry 
be given opportunity to develop a spirit of inquiry, 
and a desire to learn the ways of acquiring knowledge 
in this hitherto unknown field. Sustained effort to 
master the difficulties of the first stages in the study 
of chemistry needs at all times the assurances of 
achievement, of something accomplished day by day 
that is intelligible. 
When enough examples of combining proportions 
have been commented upon in class, and when cases 
of multiple proportion have repeatedly been noted, the 
atomic theory may then be presented as adequate ex- 
planation of the general weight relationships summed 
up as “laws” of definite and multiple proportions. 
When in addition to studies of solubility, the diffusion 
of gases, and discussions of the molecular hypothesis 
as accounting for these facts of solution and diffusion; 
when the “laws” of combining volumes of gases have 
been shown experimentally, it is time to advance 
Avogadro’s hypothesis just as he himself advanced it +

Colin, Paris. (Les Classiques de la Science). Or, see a translation

to account for these findings of Gay-Lussac. The facts 
of electrolysis should precede the theory of Arrhenius, 
and the facts of radio activity should lead up to the 
modern views of the complexity of the atom. Much 
time must elapse in getting these groups of facts be- 
fore a class in proper relations to experimental work 
done by teacher and by pupils. Any extended teach- 
ing of theory necessarily comes late in the course, and 
only after pupils have attained some considerable de- 
gree of laboratory skill, some familiarity with chemical 
symbolization, together with an ability to interpret 
both experimengal phenomena and the generalizations 
of the text. Posie discussions of theory bring 
disaster to a course. Any considerable use of equations, 
too, should wait upon the accumulation of sufficient 
experience so that very largely they set forth what is 
known as facts, rather than what is surmised to be 
true. )Pupils may manipulate a prodigious number of 
these equations as matters of memory, and at the same 
time comprehend but little of their significance. 
It not infrequently occurs in the latter part of a 
second semester that there is a notable falling off in 
interest on the part of pupils. In taking up studies 
of the metals there not uncommonly is a marked 
change in methods of instruction. The texts furnish a 
mass of data upon the carbonates, chlorides, sulphates, 
etc., of the metals about as stimulative of thought as 
any other tabulation of data. These groupings of facts 
furnish excellent material for memory “quizzes,” but 
271
-P-A-G-E-288
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
lacking suitable and simple preliminary laboratory ex- 
ercises may be as barren of interest and of significance 
as are chronological tables of historical events. It is 
at this stage of the work that projects (p. 68) will 
at times be found exceedingly helpful. 
The content of a year’s course is well set forth in a 
report? by a Committee On Chemical Education of 
the American Chemical Society on “A Standard 
Minimum Outline” for high school chemistry. 
II, Laboratory Discipline 
Certain problems of laboratory discipline are more 
or less peculiar to the teaching of chemistry. One dif- 
ficulty which many young teachers encounter in lab- 
oratory management arises from the comparative free- 
dom in moving about and in communicating with one 
another which pupils in a chemistry laboratory enjoy 
in contrast with the enforced quiet and order of class- 
rooms. This difficulty really brings with it its own 
remedy if rightly met. The very freedom of the place 
acts as a safety valve for any exuberance of spirit. A 
teacher may call the attention of a class at the outset 
of a laboratory course to the fact that more liberty of 
action should obtain than in the classroom, but that 
this liberty is not to be taken as license for disorder. 
The first law of the laboratory is attention to business. 
Pupils as a rule respond to such a fair appeal tactfully 
* School Science and Mathematics (XXIII: 777). 
272  
-P-A-G-E-289
  CHEMISTRY 
made. Should any one fail in this respect, prompt and 
firm action on the part of the teacher is imperative. No 
issue or controversy is necessary. Loss of laboratory 
privileges should follow abuse of this freedom. 
It is essential that training in laboratory habits start 
at the first of the term. Otherwise a noisy and dis- 
orderly group is almost certain, and a condition may 
result difficult to control. It is sufficient usually that 
a disorderly pupil be sent from the laboratory, either 
to the Principal’s Office or to a study room, and that he 
be required later to make up the lost time in the labora- 
tory. A talk at that time with the pupil about the 
necessity for a decent degree of order in the laboratory, 
and some reasonable pledge for his co-operation in the 
fyture, usually is all that is required. 
(The chief requirement for a wholesome laboratory 
atmosphere is a business-like attitude towards all its 
administrative and instructional features on the part 
of the teacher. ‘pe sort of spirit is contagious and 
the membership/of a class as a rule will go about its 
work with a similar attitude. Many things may be 
tolerated at times by some teachers which would be 
deemed out of order by other teachers. As an example, 
animated discussions among members of a group of 
students at times can safely be permitted to go on by 
some teachers even when marked differences of opinion 
over the facts of any experiment, and over the signi- 
ficance of such facts, may be rather loudly proclaimed. 
Such outbursts are to be endured only so long as the 
273
-P-A-G-E-290
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
pupils engaged are really thinking. Whatever fails in 
any such discussions to lead to something definite and 
worth while is disorder, and must be checked by any 
teacher when unlikely to subside of itself. The weaker 
the personality of a teacher the less of such risk should 
be taken. Meddling with apparatus not called for by 
the directions should not be tolerated. 
In addition to this attitude of teacher and pupils 
from the outset towards the laboratory work, a certain 
amount of planning must be done, with resort made 
at various times to devices which have been found 
helpful by teachers of experience. One ever-important 
matter is to provide sufficient room for each pupil in 
laboratory work. Crowding invariably leads to dis- 
order. Another item is to give such seating arrange- 
ments that when pupils are required to work in pairs 
as they may be at times, there shall be from the first a 
wise selection of teams. Usually it is better to pair 
boys with boys, and girls with girls, for obvious reasons. 
In all other respects it is wisest generally to allow 
pupils to select their own companions. By so doing, 
and without need of giving any directions concerning 
it, differences of social rank which might be violated 
by the teacher are likely to be avoided. One source 
of friction in laboratory administration is thus re- 
moved. Colored pupils should in general work to- 
gether, but always in a part of the laboratory with 
no marked disadvantages over the other parts. It is 
sometimes well, when the relative capabilities of pupils 
274 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
CHEMISTRY 
have become known, say at the beginning of a secona 
semester, to arrange pupils in pairs of approximately 
equal ability, rather than permit the brilliant and the 
dull to be unequally yoked together. 
As boys are by their very nature likely to be more 
noisy and boisterous than girls, it may at times be 
wise to arrange seatings so that pairs of boys are “well 
insulated” from other pairs by pairs of girls. Pupils 
known as likely to overstep the bounds of orderliness 
may be given places where at all times they are under 
the teacher’s eye. 
Seemingly small matters such as these, when planned 
wisely and tactfully carried out, avoid much trouble. 
The best laboratory discipline, indeed, is that condition 
where no disciplinary measures are in evidence. The 
attitude, then, of teacher and class toward the work in 
hand becomes a concerted effort “to make the most” 
of the time and opportunities of. the laboratory for 
instructional ends. One help to good order in the 
laboratory is a suitable placement of any supplemen- 
tary apparatus so that pupils may get it, and replace 
it, with the least possible travel. Pieces of apparatus 
most frequently needed should be available in larger 
quantities, and so placed as to be closer to the pupils 
than supplies Iess often used. Cases conveniently 
placed in the laboratory should have shelves and 
drawers reserved for pieces of apparatus to be used in 
common by pupils as needed at the tables. If a little 
time be taken at the outset of each course to train 
275
-P-A-G-E-292
    TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
pupils to replace all such apparatus when used, much 
subsequent bad housekeeping will be avoided. 
Where all pupils in a section are likely to need 
pieces of apparatus and material not set out where 
pupils may serve themselves, it saves time and con- 
fusion to have one or two pupils distribute the req- 
uisite supplies to the others. This should not be 
allowed to replace self-service where there is any edu- 
cational merit in the act as, for example, when an ex- 
periment directs the pupils to “weigh out accurately 
one gram” of a substance. 
III. Laboratory Equipment 
The need to dilute acids before allowing them to 
enter the waste pipes, and the necessity of preventing 
stoppage of waste pipes by solids, calls for a greatly in- 
creased size in waste pipes over what is ordinarily 
provided for sinks. The materials used in plumbing 
sometimes must be of special type to prevent rapid 
corrosion. Probably pure lead makes the best material 
for the pipes. In a chemistry laboratory the lead 
pipes when used should be brought up into the sink 
itself, and not soldered to the usual brass connections 
since the latter last but a short time because of acids 
in the waste. Where stone sinks are used, the lead 
waste pipe should be about two inches in diameter. It 
may be flared at its inlet and sealed into the hole in the 
sink by means of a paste of red lead and linseed oil, or 
some similar material.

Chemistry Tables——From the locker L each pupil gets and brings to his place at the laboratory table at the beginning of a period the drawer of apparatus issued to him. The broad shelf below the table top furnishes a place to set aside these drawers after taking from them such articles as may be needed, whether at first or later. The pupil, at the end of a period, returns his own supplies in the drawer to its place in the locker. The table tops 
are 10’x4’x1%”, and three feet up from floor. The shelf below is 33” wide, and 16” from floor. The reagent shelf is 19” above the table top and may, when desired, be omitted from the construction, thus lessening cost without any great loss in serviceableness of the table. From wall racks such as R reagents likely to be needed during a period may be transferred to the tables in advance of laboratory work, and afterward replaced by student assistants, thus leaving the tables cleared for janitor service. A posted list C of reagent solutions suitably numbered facilitates these replace- ments. The wall sink S has drainboards where washed apparatus may be left to dry, but all other apparatus should always be returned to their place. ‘These wall racks are 5244” long with five shelves 9” apart, and 5%4” wide. Small jars for table waste (not here shown) may be drained into the alberene sinks, and their solid contents dumped into large stoneware jars for the janitor. Stools in sufficient numbers are to be had as needed from places at one side,  
-P-A-G-E-294

  CHEMISTRY 
Pure lead “thimbles” one-fourth-inch thick, shaped 
like a low stovepipe hat, and drilled with numerous 
one-fourth-inch holes in the top and around the upper 
sides, when sealed over the end of the sink waste pipe 
serve to strain out the solids and to keep water stand- 
ing an inch deep in the sinks for dilutions of acids. 
These thimbles can be made and placed by the teacher, 
a brass mould first being made at a machine shop 
into which to run molten lead. Openings in the 
thimbles should be numerous enough to accommodate 
the flow of more water than both faucets can deliver 
when wide open. Such an arrangement of lead thimble 
and lead waste pipe will last for years. It is extremely 
desirable that pipes for water, gas, and waste be laid 
above the floor level in order to be accessible for re- 
pairs without tearing up the floors. Individual cut- 
offs should be supplied for each desk. The larger waste 
pipes that drain several desks or laboratories are best 
made of seamless lead-lined wrought iron or duriron 
pipes * leading into tile sewer pipes in the basement. 
All fixtures in the chemical laboratory such as draw 
pulls, hinges, latches, ete., should be of solid brass, and 
not brass-plated iron, that they may resist the corro- 
sive effects of the acid gases of the laboratory. 
Where notebook cases are kept conveniently near 
the door so that pupils can quickly get their note- 
books on entering the room, and then leave them on 
going out, a marked gain in promptness of starting 
? Duriron, a silicon-iron, is excellent material for waste pipes.

work will take place. Notebooks then are always at 
hand when needed by the pupil or by the teacher. 
Portable cases, home-made if necessary, permit carry- 
ing these notebooks back and forth between laboratory 
and classroom. In small schools such provisions as 
these are unnecessary. But where hundreds of pupils 
visit one department daily great gain results, and ef- 
ficiency in laboratory service is promoted, by following 
these or some similar administrative means for secur- 
ing a minimum of waste and a maximum of work in 
the laboratory. 
Reference books should always be available in the 
laboratory. There should be a convenient and suitable 
place to keep them on some wall shelf, or in a sectional 
book case. Pupils should be able to get these reference 
books without disturbing or distracting the attention 
of other pupils and always without leaving the room. 
This disposition of reference books is even better than 
the use of a separate departmental library room, in- 
volving as it does less travel back and forth, and fewer 
supervisory responsibilities on the part of an instructor. 
As with apparatus and materials, so pupil helpers at all 
times when desired can pass out and later replace all 
duplicate copies of reference textbooks in use. Some 
one of these pupils may serve as laboratory librarian 
whose special duty it is to note at the close of every 
laboratory period whether or not all books are back 
in place. 
By observing the spirit and some of the method of 
278

these suggestions, a teacher will find his laboratory 
discipline consumes much less of his energy, leaving 
him free for the all-important individual instruction 
which is so valuable a feature of laboratory work.

LESSONS IN MORAL TRAINING 
Tn all discussions of science teaching much emphasis 
is laid upon the need to keep always in consciousness 
the facts of any situation under consideration. These 
facts as “thought material” (a) must be assured truths 
and not mere surmises of unverified statements con- 
cerning facts; (b) they must be evaluated with refer- 
ence to relative importance while being acquired, and 
their mutual relationship established as matters of 
inference. As the result of more or less complex 
thought processes conclusions are reached based upon 
known facts, These conclusions in themselves serving 
as working hypotheses have their valuations attested 
in applications to life situations. Confidence in the 
worth of all conclusions reached is based upon the . 
degree to which they accord with the life experiences 
of individuals and of the race. Likewise, in the prob- 
lems of professional life and of the business world, a 
ready mastery of the facts as to conditions which are 
ever changing, and a promptness in deciding upon 
working hypotheses as conclusions based upon facts, 
underlie all successes attained. 
283
-P-A-G-E-302
  
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
Need exists for a like attitude and procedure in 
moral education. The experiences of public schools, 
however, are too often summed up in a declaration 
that science teachings and training do not “carry over” 
into the realms of moral education. Vital as education 
in morals is claimed to be to life’s largest possibilities, 
both personal and social, its applied aspects as part 
of training processes in public schools may be char- 
acterized at the best as hap-hazard. Little can reason- 
ably be expected from such efforts. There are many 
difficulties which chill the ardor and baffle the pur- 
poses of teachers, conscious of their responsibilities as 
positive and constructive forces in the moral life of 
their pupils. There is a lack of clear discernment of 
the series of steps to be taken, and the significance of 
these steps in a truly scientific procedure, and inability 
to handle the “human element” in the reaction of 
pupils to moral teachings and practices when authority 
as personified in the instructor ceases to exist. Teach- 
ing experience warrants the assumption of intuitive 
responses by pupils to all moral influences whose up- 
lifting effects are clearly discerned by them. Were 
such not the case, ethical and spiritual advances of 
the race must necessarily be fitful and evanescent. 
Natural perversity of human nature may or may not 
be a wholly satisfactory explanation to offer for the 
inability often apparent among men and women as 
well as children to discern and keep in mind the facts 
upon which right conduct as an exposition of character 
284
-P-A-G-E-303
APPENDIX 
is based. Both in science teaching and in moral edu- 
cation an ability to use terms fluently is uncertain 
evidence of any appreciation of the meanings back of 
those terms. 
All attempts to secure the formation of habits of 
right response in morals necessitates recalling certain 
ideas which taken together serve as standards, and 
which at the same time furnish motives for right con- 
duct. The number of such facts constituting the sub- 
ject matter in moral instruction is relatively small, 
but they offer much the same difficulty of comprehen- 
sion as those involved in undertaking to specify just 
what constitutes the “personality” of an individual. 
In the lessons which follow there is a studied effort to 
have the instruction cluster about certain significant 
phrases the very suggestion of which later, whether 
given formal utterance or not, 2s a call to face the facts 
of situations involving the moral element in conduct. 
This feature in a training process is and of necessity 
must be individualistic in the extreme. It is a matter 
private rather than public, and preferably incidental 
as to time and associations. While the emotional life 
in order to maintain a healthy state must find full and 
free expression for people generally, the springs of 
emotional life are hidden. Bared to the public, and 
subjected to the pitiless criticism and unrefined cruelty 
of classmates, they dry up and disappear from view, 
and the best intentioned efforts of faithful teachers 
are unlikely again to gain access to them.

Some Type Lessons 
The lessons which follow suggest a teaching pro- 
cedure in a course of moral instruction immediately 
applicable in school life as well as elsewhere. The 
complementary course in moral training is intended 
to develop keenness in perception of moral values, and 
positiveness in right moral reactions to life situations. 
Any such lessons can suggest only what the earnest 
painstaking teacher must himself develop in order to 
exert lifelong uplifting influences in the lives of suc- 
cessive generations of pupils. In the lessons which 
follow there has been an endeavor to preserve with a 
minimum of adaptation some of the content but more 
particularly the spirit of certain lessons whose use by 
another? in a masterful way has been witnessed by 
one of the authors, exerting an influence upon his own 
teaching through many years.

day by day is true of a boy as to age? What should 
be true of his size and strength? What after all at 
any time is a still more satisfactory test of whether a 
boy really is becoming a man of worth and power in 
the world? How after all is it really established that 
one whose age is twenty years or more, whose weight is 
one hundred twenty pounds or more, and whose height 
is six feet more or less, really is a “grown-up” and not 
a child? Give a brief definition each for man and 
boy making it especially clear wherein lies this change 
from childlikeness to manliness. (A man “tells him- 
self” what to do, and what not to do. A child has to 
be told what to do; and, if necessary, made to do it.)

perience denial of their wishes? Give an illustration

    APPENDIX E 
A PROJECT IN CHEMISTRY 
In the second semester of a high school course in 
chemistry the teaching conditions are highly favor- 
able for getting excellent results with projects. A 
wide range of industrial aspects of the science, and the 
intimate relationships of chemistry to nutrition and 
growth in plants and animals including as this does the 
human body in states of health, makes the subject mat- 
ter of chemistry well suited to a relatively large use of 
projects. The divisions and sub-divisions of topics in 
chemistry are clear-cut, representing distinct fields of 
study. The maturity of the pupils in a 12th grade, 
and their extended training in laboratory procedure, 
warrants expectations of highly valuable educational 
results from the more capable pupils. There is a 
wealth of literature in chemistry, too, admirably suited 
to such uses, and it at once becomes a storehouse of 
material adaptable to the needs of high school pupils 
throughout a wide range of projects. 
In place of furnishing here a “List of Projects,” it 
has seemed likely to be of greater helpfulness to follow 
out the details of one such project as typical of others 
naturally suggesting themselves to an instructor. In 
312
-P-A-G-E-331
  APPENDIX 
the course of a teacher’s work many others more or 
less adaptable will be found noted in text and refer- 
ence books. The prime requisite for success in the use 
of projects applies here as elsewhere, viz., a hearty co- 
operation on the part of pupils, and that degree of 
initiative and resourcefulness which shall make the 
project one for the pupil rather than the teacher. The 
guidance of many of these projects simultaneously 
carried on by pupils as individuals, or at times work- 
ing in groups, and the verification or disapproval of 
some of their claims, will provide for the busy chem- 
istry teacher one of the many ways in which to employ 
his “spare time.” 
Let it be supposed that the instructor for any one of 
various reasons desires to depart from the formal 
teaching procedure, and at the same time make a study 
of Sodium, And Its Important Compounds. For a 
“survey of the field,” a series of “problems” may suit- 
ably be set forth as topics in the form of questions, 
such as the following: 
How is baking soda made from common salt? 
What is the nature of baking powder? What pur- 
pose is served by it in cooking? 
What is “soda ash”? What its use in glass mak- 
ing? 
How is dry, free-running table salt made from 
crude rock salt? 
What are (a) washing soda crystals; (b) washing 
powders? What is the use of either in laundry 
work? What is (a) “climaline”; (b) “sapolio’? 
313 
 
-P-A-G-E-332
  TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
What is Chili saltpeter, and its relations to (a) 
fertilizers; (b) high explosives? What is 
Glauber’s salt, and its preparation, and use? 
What is the “oxone” employed in making oxygen? 
What is the action by which oxygen is liberated? 
What is caustic soda? What use has sodium hy- 
droxide in the soap-making process? 
It will be noted at once that the foregoing list of 
inquiries covers as compounds of sodium the oxide, hy- 
droxide, chloride, nitrate, sulphate, carbonate and its 
hydrated crystal forms, bicarbonate, and phosphate. 
In the course of the project pupils will need to pre- 
pare all these substances, preferably from the same 
materials used in commerce, and possibly by use of the 
same methods. They will require assistance in the way 
of suggestions as to manner of approach in different 
operations, and considerable guidance that time-waste 
and discouragement be minimized. Less and less help 
should be necessary as the work goes on. 
In general a class of pupils working upon a project 
of such scope as this may subdivide it along lines 
suited to the topic, and may work in groups whose com- 
bined report shall complete the project as a whole. 
To the largest degree possible any student should have 
choice of his part. After class projects in chemistry 
have been completed, especially if pupils have had 
projects in other science subjects, a much freer choice 
can be permitted even to work carried on independ- 
ently. These choices must at all times be consistent 
314
-P-A-G-E-333
APPENDIX 
with laboratory facilities, the capabilities of the pupil, 
and avoidance of any risk of accidents. At the outset 
of the work pupils should find out as much as they can 
about the nature of the material with which they as 
individuals or as a group are to work,—its history, its 
laboratory preparation, its manufacture. A committee 
in charge may assign parts of these efforts to certain 
pupils, and include in these assignments the theoreti- 
cal aspects of problems covered by the project, and 
the actual steps in laboratory preparation of any sub- 
stances studied. Through this committee various as- 
pects of the project are kept abreast, and the project 
more promptly completed as a result of “group activi- 
ties.” 
Notes should be kept by individual pupils, and from 
these notes written accounts of each phase of the proj- 
ect should be prepared for a report to the class as a 
whole under direction, it may be, of a “committee.” 
These reports should be made at some set date, and 
made much of even to an abandonment of laboratory 
work for the time needed to give and discuss the report. 
The class should take notes of items reported, and 
every pupil should be given a chance to ask questions 
for his own enlightenment, or for clarification of what 
has been poorly set forth. The committee reporting 
should likewise prepare a suitable set of questions for 
dictation to the class as basis later for an examination 
covering the subject matter of the reports. This gives 
the committee a splendid opportunity to practice the 
315
-P-A-G-E-334
    TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
selection of the essentials of a project. A more search- 
ing examination should be given any group upon its 
own part of a project than the class as a whole. These 
“major” and “minor” examinations furnish excellent 
opportunities to estimate relative abilities of pupils, 
and they afford desirable variety in work for the pupils. 
When project work is first started all needed refer- 
ence books should be made accessible, and pupils taught 
how these books are used to best advantage. They 
soon will learn which books are rich in historical mat- 
ter, and which are best for theoretical or industrial as- 
pects of their problems. In these ways pupils may be 
expected to gain the “reference habit” in use of books. 
Some prodding of individual pupils may at times be 
necessary so that they do their parts of the work, and 
close oversight is necessary that everyone be kept busy. 
This is incidental to and not in conflict with the idea 
of initiative and persistency of effort on the part of 
pupils when at work on a project. These pupils have 
not yet attained the age of independent effort as work- 
ers, but as yet are pupils in training. The project type 
of work so appeals to pupils, however, that it may be 
counted upon in time a majority of them will go ahead 
with their particular projects with the greatest of profit 
to themselves. The spirit of mastery engendered re- 
acts most favorably upon the regulation types of teach- 
ing as carried on along with teachings by use of proj- 
ects, i 
By frequent consultations with his pupils the teacher 
316
-P-A-G-E-335
  APPENDIX 
can see to it that every point he himself would bring 
out if teaching the subject is brought out by one or 
another of the pupils during the presentation of re- 
ports. In the case of the sodium compounds as above, 
should the teacher desire to have hydrolysis taught, the 
pupil whose study was washing soda having noted the 
reaction of litmus to a water solution of the normal 
salt should have studied the accepted explanation of 
this apparently anomalous effect, and should report 
these findings to the class. Again, the “baking-powder 
pupil” finding aluminum sulphate in some baking 
powders will need to make report on hydrolysis in con- 
nection with the acid reactions occurring in his prob- 
lem. The class thus gets several different approaches 
to important teachings concerning such items as these, 
especially where the work of a group committee is skil- 
fully guided on its course by a teacher without undue 
interference and domination of their efforts. 
The rate at which ground is covered by this method 
at first is necessarily slow. But, as compared with an 
oftentimes lifeless study of textbooks, it will be found 
that the rate of educational advance becomes much 
more rapid by use of projects. Since it is a task of no 
small magnitude for management of projects by a 
teacher, it is not to be undertaken with groups too 
large. Sixteen is a comfortable number to handle. 
With a larger number supervision by a teacher lacks in 
definiteness of knowledge and control over what is be- 
ing done by individual pupils. 
317  
-P-A-G-E-336
    TEACHING OF SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER 
Pupils when of sufficient age and dependability may 
be given considerable freedom when working a project. 
They may even be allowed to go to the public library 
during school hours, or visit industrial and municipal 
plants, in getting information relative to water supply, 
fire prevention, manufacture of artificial ice and illu- 
minating gas, cold storage plants, sewage and garbage 
disposal, or other places to which their projects may 
lead. A “form letter” introducing any such pupil to 
some one in a plant visited to whom the instructor is 
personally known, stating purpose of the visit and re- 
questing such opportunities for gaining definite infor- 
mation as are reasonable requests to make, will spare 
much grief and discouragement. The conditions named 
suggest within what narrow limits these projects must 
be confined lest the plants visited withdraw the privi- 
lege of visitations. Then, too, there must be no tres- 
passing on the time of other teachers no matter how 
enthusiastic any pupil may become in his projects. 
The inter-relations of things, and their mutual de- 
pendence, will manifest themselves and be impressed 
upon the members of a class as they take note how fre- 
quently seemingly diverse projects have much in com- 
mon. At such times it is oftentimes well to let one 
pupil give instruction to another concerning what he 
himself has previously mastered. It relieves the in- 
structor that much, and is mutually helpful to the pu- 
pils concerned. For example, where one committee 
working on washing soda has been assisted to an under- 
318
-P-A-G-E-337

standing of hydrolysis by the teacher, a pupil-encount- 
ering alum in baking powder may go to a “washing- 
soda” pupil for help in understanding his difficulties, 
and both will profit by their efforts to learn and to give 
instructional assistance. 
As a by-product of the use of projects pupils are 
helped in public speaking. The slowness and distinct- 
ness of speech necessary in addressing the membership 
of a large class in distinction from talking to the 
teacher comes strongly into evidence when giving re- 
ports, as does the necessity of presentations of a con- 
vincing character. After a little experience pupils can 
- get away from reading reports to use of an outline, and 
in due time to presentation of a well-ordered account 
without any written helps. And this suggests that 
these “Reports,” and the discussions accompanying 
their presentation, together with the concerted sus- 
tained effort they represent, may very suitably make 
these “Projects” a rich field of endeavor for the “Sci- 
ence Club” of the school. Where but one such club 
exists in school the several sciences represented in the 
club membership may in turn offer their contributions.

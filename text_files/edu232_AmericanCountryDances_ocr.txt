PREFACE 
For this first volume of American Folk-Dances I have taken the “contra-dances” of rural New 
England, for this is one of the old, most truly American sections of our country, where many genera- 
tions of the same stock have grown up undisturbed by foreign influences, and where sufficient time has 
elapsed since the days of the early settlers for the building up of certain traditions and customs. 
The social group-dances which have originated or evolved through common usage under such con- 
ditions in this country are as truly folk-dances as those found in the older countries, and have elements 
which are almost universally characteristic of folk-dances. /And yet it has often been said that our 
country has no folk-music or folk-dancing of wey eee ae that of the American Indian, We are ano <j =e 
to-day a nation of immigrants, neteofErians, and the folk-traditions that are most essentially our own 
  are those which have developed (from traditions brought to us by our early immigrants) into some- 
thing peculiarly our own. And we have the new and dazzling wealth of folk-art brought in with the 
comparatively recent rush of immigration from many countries, the beauty and value of which is not yet 
generally understood or appreciated. Surely, the folk-dances and music of all the nationalities which 
make up the people of our country may be considered ours just as these people are our people, and every 
effort should be made to encourage, preserve and assimilate this dancing and music, so that we may not 
only have these added resources for social enjoyment and recreation, but ss our national life may be 
enriched with beauty and éolor and joy of living which may become the foundation of a yet undreamed-of 
development of art in this country. “* 
It was with the hope of assisting toward this end that my earlier collections of folk-dances and 
music of other countries were published, and for the same purpose the Organization Committee of an 
American Folk-Dance Society was formed in February, 1916.' 
\/ 'Phis-present_volume-contains some of he old Country-Dances which are most essentially Ameri- 
‘an Folk-Dances because they have grown here.)“Some of them are slightly reminiscent of English coun- 
try-dances, and were probably originally suggested by or evolved from them. Most of them, however, 
seem to be products of this country, and all have a typical and distinctly individual quality of their own, 
both in their form and the manner and style in which they are danceds(‘The constant repetition of the 
theme, and the easy swing and rhythm of the dance, are almost hypnotically csigeoas 
10n account of the war the work of this organization has been postponed. 
2A study of the form and pattern of these folk-dances shows (as in all folk-dances) the close analogy between the folk-dance and 
the folk-songs.

These old dances also have a really delightful social element, in that each couple progresses to a new 
place in the set and dances with a new couple at each repetition of the figure. Jom for Pxpe F 
Many of the dances included in this collection are in common use at the present time in New Eng- 
land, at country dances, where I have had the pleasure of dancing them; a number of them are rarely 
danced now and have prastigally dianppessed. They were resurrected for me, from memory,‘by old 
fiddlers and others who used to acta theold-time “kitchen dances” forty years or so ago.) Still others 
are from some of the numerous old “call books” of that time, which were used by the fiddlers who 
played and “‘called” for the dances. In these only the “calls” for the figures were given and no de- 
scription of how the figures were done. Fortunately, the same calls are used for certain figures to-day, so 
that with a knowledge of these it has been possible to interpret and describe some of the dances which 
are now obsolete. hen -+hese --pnok On Names .

> and _ Some of the dances which are a from New England are the Virginia Reel, “Dan Tucker,’ 
“John Brown.” The Virginia Reel has been considered by many as the most representative American 
folk-dance, whereas it is nothing more nor less than the well-known popular English country-dance 
known as “Sir Roger de Coverly,//and can hardly be classed among the more typically American 
country-dances which have either evolved or originated here. “Sir Roger” was apparently brought 
by the English to Virginia, where it became popular as a society dance. It has remained practically 
unchanged, and, as the “Virginia Reel,” has become widely known, probably more as a society dance 
than a country-dance. Dan Tucker is an old favorite in the Middle West, and John Brown (which 
is so similar to Dan Tucker that it probably is a variation of it) was found in Connecticut.) 
\ Ft-will-be-noticed=that fany of the tunes to which these dances are done are popular old Irish, 
English and Scotch jigs, reels and hornpipes (which by long familiarity have become our own), or

It is a misfortune that such dances and tunes as these should fall into disuse, and that summer 
visitors to the country should place their stamp upon the dancing and music there, instead of taking 
advantage of the opportunity to enjoy the country dances and to bring them back to the city, where this 
kind of dancing could be a source of social enjoyment. The introduction of modern dancing into the

country inevitably forces out the old fiddlers (who cannot play the new dance-music, though they play 
the old dance-music irresistibly), and the older people, who can dance only the contra-dances. The 
forcing out of such music and such dancing is a real loss to the life of the rural community, as well as 
to the cause of folk-dancing. Fortunately, however, enough of these dances still remain to make it 
possible to revive them, and perhaps to bring them into more general use have prepared this 
collection in the hope that it may be of assistance in spreading a more general knowledge of some of 
our most typically American dances, so that many others may share the delight which I have found 
in them. 
For my knowledge of these dances I am indebted to friends too numerous to mention in different 
parts of New England, and in particular to Mr. Kimball (‘Uncle Steve”), who has played the violin 
for country dances for over forty years, Mr. and Mrs. Cyrus Durgin, Mr. and Mrs. N. M. Holden, Mr. 
and Mrs. Harry McKeen, Mr. Joe Farnham, and many other friends.

  THE DANCES 
MUSIC. 
The most characteristic music for these dances is 
that to which they have been done in their original 
setting in the past—namely, the music of a single 
violin, played as only the real contra-dance fiddler 
can play it! Nowadays, however, the violin and 
piano (or violin and organ) are most usual at 
country dances, and the old-time fiddlers who play 
alone and “‘call” for the dancing are scarce. These 
jigs, reels and hornpipes are essentially violin music, 
and no other instrument can do them full justice. 
Since, however, violin music will probably not be 
available for general use, the music in this volume 
has been arranged for the piano. 
CALLS. 
The dances are most successful when ‘‘called.” 
It has been the custom for the violinist to ‘‘call” 
the figures as he plays, and this is quite a difficult 
art. The calls are expressions or phrases which 
stand for certain definite figures, and in this way 
the dancers are prompted, so that in a large set all 
the dancers begin the various figures simultaneously 
and the dance proceeds in an orderly and regular 
manner. Some of the typical old calls are: “Bal- 
ance and Swing,” “Down the Centre and Back,” 
“Cast Off,” “Ladies’ Chain,” “Right and Left,” 
“Four Hands Around,” “Forward and Back,” etc. 
The way to time the calls is as follows: 
1. After playing a strain of the music through, 
rather rapidly, to give notice of the next 
dance, call: ‘‘Please form for Chorus Jig” 
(or whatever the dance is to be). If the 
dancers do not form promptly, repeat the 
strain. 
2. When the set is formed and ready to begin, 
call: ‘‘Down the Outside and Back” (or 
whatever the first call is), and immedi- 
ately after giving this call, begin playing. 
In this way the dancers have preliminary 
notice of what the figure is to be, and begin 
dancing on the first note of the music. 
3. Each succeeding call is given during the 
two measures immediately preceding the 
strain on which the next figure is to be 
started. It is given just before the dancers 
finish the preceding figure. 
To bring the dance to a close, call: ‘‘Forward and 
Swing Partners,” and during the last two measures 
of first strain, while they are swinging, call: “‘Prom- 
enade around the Hall” (or “Promenade to Seats”), 
and play the second strain to the finish. 
27424 FORMATIONS. 
There are three formations characteristic of 
contra-dances: (1) Around the room in couples; (2) 
Quadrille set; and (3) Longways set. In the fol- 
lowing diagrams illustrating these, and in all 
diagrams throughout the book, the following sym- 
bols are used to represent the women and men:

(3) Longways Formation 
There are two kinds of longways formations: 
27424 
uauIOM (a) Ordinary formation 
The dancers form in two parallel lines, 
the women on the left as seen from the 
front, and the men on the right. This 
is the formation of the majority of the 
dances. (Cf. Old Zip Coon, Chorus 
Jig, Fisher’s Hornpipe, Arkansas 
Traveler, etc., Diagram 3.)

  (b) “First, third and every other couple 
cross over” 
The dancers first take the ordinary 
formation; then, at the call ‘‘First, 
third and every other couple cross 
over,” the man and woman of each 
odd couple (Ist, 3rd, 5th, 7th, etc.), 
exchange places (Diagram 4). From 
this new formation the dance is begun.

  LONGWAYS DANCES 
Number of couples in a set 
All longways dances require at least six couples in 
aset. Three of the dances in this collection‘are in- 
tended for six couples only; these are the Virginia 
Reel, the Devil’s Dream and Chase the Squirrel. 
All the others may be danced by a large number of 
couples, the length of the set being limited only by 
the length of the room. When large numbers are 
dancing, however, it is better to divide them into 
two sets, so that the progression may be continued 
until all have made the complete round of the set, 
without making the dance too long. 
Characteristics 
With but six exceptions, all the dances in this col- 
lection are in longways formation, and have the 
following elements in common: 
(1) A routine of figures, which constitute the 
dance, and which is repeated continuously 
until the dance is brought to a close. 
(2) A general form or pattern in which these 
figures are arranged, which has two parts: 
(a) A first, or characteristic, part, con- 
sisting of figures peculiar to the par- 
ticular dance. 
(b) A second, or common, part, which is 
almost identical in all these dances, 
consisting of several figures, one of 
which is the “casting off,’ which 
effects a shift of the dancers to new 
positions in the set, and gives the 
dance its progressive character. 
This progressive element is peculiarly character- 
istic of contra-dances, and gives them their delight- 
ful social element, since each couple progresses to a 
new position in the set at each repetition of the 
dance, and dances with a different couple each 
time. 
Progression 
Some of the longways dances have figures which 
involve two couples, while others involve three 
couples, but in both cases the progression is ac- 
complished in the same manner, that is, all these 
sub-groups of two (or three) couples throughout the 
set dance simultaneously, and at the ‘‘cast off” the 
head couple of each of these sub-groups move down 
one place lower in the set, so that at the next repe- 
tition of the dance they dance with the new couple 
or couples who are now next below them. In the 
dances where the figures involve two couples, it is 
the odd couples (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) who take the in- 
itiative, cast off, and progress down the set one 
place lower each time. These I have termed the 
“active” couples, while the other couples (2nd, 4th, 
6th, etc.) are called the “neutral” couples. In the 
dances where three couples are involved, the Ist, 
27424 4th, 7th couples, etc., are the active ones, and the 
2nd and 3rd, 5th and 6th, 8th and 9th, etc., are the 
neutral couples. 
In every longways dance, all the Suge in the 
set begin dancing at the same time and continue 
with the ‘‘active” couples ‘‘casting off’ and pro- 
gressing down the set one place lower each time, so 
that the ‘‘neutral” couples are gradually moved up 
toward the head of the set. When a neutral couple 
reach the head of the set, they stand idle during one 
repetition of the dance, and then become ‘“‘active,” 
as already described. 
In the ‘‘Lady of the Lake,” and other dances 
where the “‘First, third and every other couple cross 
over” before beginning the dance, a neutral couple, 
on reaching the head of the set, exchange places 
and stand idle during one repetition of the dance; 
then become ‘“‘active.” When an active couple 
reach the foot of the set, they exchange places and 
become ‘‘neutral.” 
e ‘Cast off” 
“Casting off” is the evolution by which the active 
couple accomplishes its progression to the next 
lower place jn the set. It is invariably preceded by 
“Down the Centre and Back,” in which the active 
couples go down the centre of the set and return up 
the centre to a point almost in line with the places 
they have just been occupying in the set. Here 
they release hands, separate, passing through the 
gaps in their lines which represent their places at 
the beginning of the figure, go around behind the 
next couple, and take up a new position next below 
that couple. (Diagram 5.)

  THE STEPS 
The Usual Country-Dance Step 
The invariable step used throughout these dances 
(unless otherwise specified) is an easy, natural, 
springy walking step. This is executed, especially 
by the men, with a certain slight emphasis and com- 
placency of manner, which almost suggest a 
swagger. There is a slight raising of the elbows at 
each step, and a slight scuffing of the feet. Two of 
these steps are taken to a measure. 
Buzz Step 
This is a sort of pivoting step, used when swinging 
partners in place. The man holds his partner in 
ordinary dance position, but well out to his right, 
so that they are practically side by side, with right 
shoulder to right shoulder. (Diagram 6). 
Diagram 6 
In fitting the step to the music, each measure 
should be counted (‘‘one, and, two, and’). On 
“one,” put down the right foot in place; on ‘‘and,” 
step forward on the ball of the left foot; on ‘‘two,” 
put down the right foot on the same spot as before; 
on ‘‘and,” step forward on the ball of the left foot, 
and soon. The step is usually continued for eight 
measures, and is merely a quick walk (or run) with 
the right foot always put down in the same place 
and the left foot always advancing. More weight 
is put on the right foot than on the left, which gives 
a slight emphasis on ‘‘one” and ‘‘two.” With this 
step the man swings his partner around very vig- 
orously. Chassé Step 
In fitting this step to the music, each measure 
should be counted: ‘‘one, and, two, and.” 
(Meas. 1.) On ‘‘one,” slide the foot forward; 
on ‘‘and,” close the left foot to the right foot. 
On “‘two,” slide the right foot forward again; 
on ‘‘and,” pause. 
(Meas. 2.) Repeat the same with the left foot. 
This is merely the familiar ‘‘two-step.” 
Galop Step 
In fitting this step to the music, each measure 
should be counted, “‘one, and, two, and.” 
On “‘one,” slide the right foot sideward to the 
right; on ‘‘and,” close the other foot to it; on 
“‘two,” slide the same foot again to the side as before; 
on “and,” close the other to it, and so on, continuing 
in the same direction. (To galop to the left, ex- 
ecute the same step to the left with the left foot.) 
Balance Step 
The following are five different ways in which the 
balance step is done: 
(A) (Meas. 1-2.) Take two walking steps for- 
ward and two backward. 
(B) (Meas. 1.) Step forward on the right foot 
(one); then swing the left slightly forward and 
at the same time raise and lower the right heel 
(two). 
(Meas. 2.) Step forward on the left foot; then 
swing the right foot forward. 
(C) Same as B, but continuing forward during 
the second measure. 
(D) (Meas. 1.) Step to the right with the right 
foot (one), and close the left foot to the right 
(two). 
(Meas. 2.) Repeat the same to the left. 
(E) Same asD, but taking it forward and back, 
instead of to right and left. 
THE FIGURES 
Balance and Swing (or, “Swing Partners”’) 
The most usual way of executing the “Balance 
and Swing” to-day, is for partners to meet, take 
“ordinary dance position” (the usual way of hold- 
ing partner for waltzing), and swing around vig- 
orously with the buzz step or the usual country- 
dance step, both man and woman beginning with 
the right foot. Originally the “Balance” was 
executed before the swing, but for some reason 
this has been almost universally abandoned, so 
that the expression “‘Balance and Swing” now 
means nothing more than “Swing Partners.” (See 
Balance Step, under STEPs.) 
27424 Down the Centre and Back 
In ordinary position (or sometimes with crossed 
hands joined) a couple go eight steps down the 
centre of the set toward the foot; then swing 
half around (or, when crossed hands are joined, 
they face about without releasing hands and 
without swinging around) so as to face up the set, 
and return eight steps toward the head of the set 
(8 measures). 
Down the Outside and Back 
The man and woman go eight steps down the 
[ xiv ]
-P-A-G-E-17
  outside of their respective lines, then face about 
and, retracing their steps, return to their places (& 
measures). 
Down the Outside and up the Centre 
The man and woman go down the outside of their 
respective lines as in the preceding figure. They 
meet at the foot of the set, where they join hands 
and return up the centre of the set (& measures). 
Woman down the Outside and Man down the 
Centre 
The woman goes down the outside of her line and 
returns, as in the preceding figure, while at the same 
time her partner goes down the centre of the set and 
returns up the centre (8 measures). 
Woman down the Centre and Man down the 
Outside 
The reverse of the preceding figure. 
All Hands Around 
All dancers join hands in a ring (with hands 
slightly raised), and circle 16 steps to the left, in 
the direction of the hands of the clock (8 measures). 
Eight Hands Around 
Eight dancers join hands in a ring, and circle to 
the left, as in the preceding figure (8 measures). 
Four Hands Around 
Four dancers circle as in the preceding figure. 
Half Around 
The dancers join hands in a ring as in the three 
preceding figures, and circle to the left, but go only 
halfway around, with 8 steps (4 measures). 
Ladies’ Chain 
This is danced by two couples facing each other, 
with the women on the right of their partners. The 
two women advance toward each other and join 
right hands; passing each other, they release right 
hands and join left hands with the opposite 
men. Without releasing her left hand, each man 
puts his right arm around the woman’s waist and 
swings her half around, so that they face the dancers 
on the opposite side. All this is done in eight steps 
(4 measures). During the next four measures the 
same is repeated, so that the women return to their 
own partners, who swing them around in the same 
manner, so that all finish in their original positions 
(8 measures). 
There is a variation in the manner of executing 
this figure in several of the dances, but this is 
described where it occurs. 
27424 
  Promenade 
To promenade is merely to march around the set 
in couples, in the direction opposite to the hands of 
theclock. (Diagram 7.) 
   ie. 
   Diagram 7 
It is most usual for partners to join crossed hands 
and promenade either with the usual country-dance 
step or with the chassé step. Sometimes, however, 
they dance around the set with galop step, in or- 
dinary dance position. 
Half Promenade 
In a half promenade, the couples go only halfway 
around a circle. This figure occurs only in the 
“Boston Fancy,” where each separate couple ex- 
ecute it with the opposite couple, so that the two 
lines finish in exchanged positions. (Diagram 8.) ( Diagram 8 
Promenade Around the Hall (or, Promenade to 
Seats) 
When this call is given, each man offers his right 
arm to his partner, and escorts her to a seat. 
Right and Left 
This is executed either by two opposite couples (as 
in The Circle), or by two women with two opposite 
men (as in Hull’s Victory, Old Zip Coon, etc.). It 
consists of two dancers’ exchanging places with the 
two opposite dancers in the following manner: 
[xv]
-P-A-G-E-18
The two couples advance toward each other, and 
‘‘pass through,”’ the one on the right in each couple 
going between the opposite two. (Diagram 9.) 
  Diagram 9 
Then, keeping side by side as if their inside hands 
were joined, each couple continue to the opposite 
side, wheeling half around (to do this, the one on 
the left makes a left-about-face and walks back- 
ward, keeping the right shoulder toward the other’s 
left shoulder), thus finishing on the opposite side 
with the right one still on the right, and the left one 
still on the left. (Diagram 10.) All this is done in 
eight steps (4 measures).

They then return in the same manner to their 
original position (4 measures). 
Half Right and Left 
  cross over as described, but instead of returning 
again, they ‘remain where they are (8 steps, 4 
measures). 
Right-Hand Mill 
Four dancers join right hands (as indicated in 
Diagram 11), and move around in the direction of 
the hands of the clock. 
  Diagram 11 
Left-Hand Mill 
This is the reverse of the preceding figure. 
Grand Right and Left (or, ‘‘Grand Chain”). 
This is done in a quadrille set. Partners face each 
other, and join right hands; then, passing each 
other, each gives the left hand to the next dancer; 
then the right hand to the next, and so on until all 
return to original places. (Diagram 12.) 
This is the same as Right and Left, except that 
only the first half of tke figure is done; that is, they Diagram 12

THE CIRCLE 
This dance is in some localities known as ‘‘Cir-

There are also slight variations in the order of the 
figures. The Circle is usually danced immediately 
after the ““Grand March,” or “‘March,” with which 
it is customary to open a dance. 
Formation: At the close of the grand march, the 
dancers are in a column of couples all around the 
room. At the call ‘“‘Form for Circle” the odd 
couples (first, third, fifth, etc.) turn around so 
as to face the couple behind, with whom they 
begin the dance. (Diagram 1.)

*It has become a common practice to form in one long set for 
the Virginia Reel, and when there are many dancers, this causes a 
large proportion of them to stand idle much of the time. It is doubt- 
less on this account that the dance has lost a great deal of its former 
popularity. When danced in the original formation of six couples, 
for which it was intended, it will be found much more lively and 
enjoyable.—Editor.

Steps: The usual country-dance step. 
The Dance. 
“Down the Outside and up the Centre” 
(Meas. 1-4.) The first woman turns outward 
and goes down the outside of the women’s line 
to the foot of the set, and at the same time 
the first man crosses over and “chases” her

about, return up the centre, release hands, Without releasing hands, face 
separate, and “cast off,” falling into the place 
next below the second couple.  
-P-A-G-E-35
  
“Right and Left” 
(Meas. 9-16.) The first and second women 
execute “Right and Left” with the first and 
second men, and finish with first couple next 
below the second couple. 
The first couple now repeat the whole dance with 
the new couple below them, and continue in the 
same manner, progressing down the set one place 
lower each time. 
The two other odd couples (third and fifth), are 
also “active,” and dance “Down the centre and 
back” and “Right and Left,” at the same time and 
in the same manner as described for the first couple, 
but stand idle during the chasing figure. 
The even couples (second, fourth and sixth), are 
“neutral,” and move up one place higher in the 
set each time. When a “neutral” couple reach 
the head, they stand idle during one repetition of 
the dance; then they become “active,” and dance 
as described for the first couple. 
When an “active” couple reach the foot of the 
set, they become “neutral.” 
Nore: In the chasing figure it is possible for 
all the “active” couples to take part as follows: 
When the first woman goes down the outside with 
her partner following her, the third woman waits 
until the first man has passed behind her, when 
she falls in behind him with her partner following 
her; while the fifth woman waits and falls in behind 
the third man when he has passed her. In this

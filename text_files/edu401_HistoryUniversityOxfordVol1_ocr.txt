PREFACE 
N these two volumes I have endeavoured to write the history 
of the University of Oxford as far as theaccession of King 
William III. I hope in a third and final volume to deal 
with the Oxford of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and 
to bring the story down to the days of the Great War. No man 
can enter on so large an undertaking without serious misgivings. 
I could not have attempted it without encouragement and 
assistance from historical scholars in Oxford and elsewhere. 
That there is room for a history of the University will hardly 
be questioned. The subject seems to have been but little studied 
until comparatively recent years. The volume published by Sir 
Henry Maxwell Lyte in 1886 was the first critical history to 
appear, the first indeed of any consequence since Anthony Wood’s 
memorable work. But it closes with the death of Wolsey, and 
I understand that it is not the author’s intention to continue it. 
Dean Rashdall’s great work on the Universities of Europe in 
the Middle Ages, published in 1895, contains an account of 
Medieval Oxford, of its origin, its Schools and its constitutional 
development, which is essential to every student of the subject. 
But Dr. Rashdall’s work, singularly complete within its own 
limits, does not aim at covering more than a portion of the 
ground. I may perhaps say that, without the late Dean’s kindly 
assurance that there was still in his view a space to fill, I should 
not have ventured on this task at all: and it is a matter of 
deep regret to me that his death, which occurred while these 
volumes were passing through the press, has deprived me of the 
pleasure of submitting them to him. My debt both to Dr. 
Rashdall and to Sir H. Maxwell Lyte is as obvious as its acknow- 
ledgment is sincere. 
Apart from these two important histories there has accumu- 
lated during the last forty years a great deal of valuable material, 
among the publications of the Oxford Historical Society and 
elsewhere, which the average reader perhaps has done little to 
explore. On some points, indeed, and at some periods the 
wealth of materials available both in print and in manuscript 
is embarrassingly large. History, says a well-known dictum, 
cannot be written from manuscripts. It certainly cannot be 
written without them. But there is truth in the view that the 
vil
-P-A-G-E-8
viii A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
work of deciphering and editing manuscripts is a special depart- 
ment of historical study, a preliminary process of the first 
importance before the writing of history can begin. I have been 
able, with the help given me at Oxford, to draw freely on manu- 
script sources in the University Archives, the Bodleian and the 
Colleges, which are referred to in my notes. I have used extracts 
from the University Registers, which are not, I think, familiar, 
and other manuscript materials at Lambeth Palace, at the 
Record Office, the British Museum, and elsewhere. Under the 
guidance of Mr. Strickland Gibson of the Bodleian Library, whose 
long-delayed work on the Ancient Statutes of the University is 
on the point of publication, I have gone rather closely into the 
history of the early Statutes, and on some points, like the im- 
portant Lambeth manuscript containing the Statutes of Cardinal 
Pole, I have had access to unprinted materials that are little 
known. But the printed matter now available is rich and varied. 
The example of editing University Registers set by Mr. Anstey 
in his Munimenta Academica (1868) has been followed by well- 
known scholars since. The work of Mr. Boase and Dr. Andrew 
Clark on the University Registers, Dr. Clark’s untiring labours on 
the life and writings of Anthony Wood, the studies of Mr. James 
Parker and other volumes contributed to the Oxford Historical 
Society by Mr. Falconer Madan, Mr. A. G. Little and a number 
of distinguished writers, and above all the fine work done for 
many years by Mr. H. E. Salter, are evidence of the progress 
made in Oxford historical research. To Mr. Salter’s full and 
exact knowledge, and to his great kindness in sharing it with 
others, I owe again and again a very special debt. But I owe 
even more to the generous assistance given me by Mr. Gibson, 
who for some years has not only furnished me with notes and 
transcripts, but has put at my disposal his proofs, his scholarship 
and his invaluable advice. These men and others like them are 
the real historians of Oxford, and I should be glad to think my 
book might touch the level which their work has reached. 
On the history of the Oxford Colleges a great deal of interesting 
matter has been made available in recent years. Important 
volumes upon Merton, Corpus and Pembroke have been written 
by Mr. Brodrick, Dr. Fowler and Mr. Macleane. The volume on 
The Colleges of Oxford, edited by Dr. Clark in 1892, has been 
followed by a series of small College histories, containing often 
admirable work. The Brasenose College Quatercentenary Mono- 
graphs are a fine example of College patriotism. Mr. Salter has 
edited not only the Oxford Deeds of Balliol, but more lately the 
first part of the Merton Register. And Dr, Magrath has published 
a detailed history of the College whose documents he knows so 
thoroughly and whose interests he has served so long. On all

these volumes I have ventured to draw freely for my short 
sketches of College history, and I hope that my indebtedness to 
their authors will be found to be fully acknowledged in my notes. 
To the writers of some of them, like the present Vice-Chancellor, 
Dr. Magrath, Dr. Blakiston, Professor Grant Robertson, Mr. 
H. A. Wilson, Mr. W. Carr, I am under special obligations for 
answering questions upon points of doubt. I have been allowed 
to supplement these printed materials by consulting College 
records: in only one case was permission refused. And, though 
in many cases the printed materials are now ample—in the case 
of Queen’s College, for instance, it seemed to me superfluous 
to go beyond them—and though it would be vain to try in the 
space at my disposal to re-write from the beginning College 
histories on which great care and labour have been spent, it is 
often valuable and sometimes necessary to study the original 
documents, Statutes and foundation charters, to make excerpts 
from the Registers, and to examine the accounts and other manu- 
scripts in College archives. If the College Registers, except at 
Merton, are a little disappointing, the College account-books not 
seldom furnish delightful details. I have to thank almost every 
College Head and many College Bursars, Librarians and officials 
for giving me facilities to see them, and for responding with 
unfailing kindness to the troublesome inquiries made. May one 
who owes much to the courtesy of Qxford scholars express the 
hope that means may yet be found of giving College documents 
better protection in certain cases where it is still needed, of 
indexing and cataloguing their contents more fully, and of 
rendering them perhaps more easily accessible to students who 
are permitted to consult them ? 
The problem of how best to deal with College history in a 
work of this kind is not easy. To omit it with all its life and 
colour is impossible. It is equally impossible within my limits 
to give it in detail. But in these two volumes I have aimed at 
giving a careful account of the foundation of each College, of its 
Statutes and its buildings, and a sketch of its story down to 
1688. To do this, I have had to choose one of two courses, 
neither of which is free from objection—either to break up the 
history of each College into separate periods and to return to 
it from time to time, or else to follow it up as it arises, to make 
it for the purposes of these volumes continuous, and thus to 
anticipate the general history. After trying both courses, I am 
satisfied that the better one is to make the sketch of each College 
complete so far as may be in itself, even although this involves, 
in the case of the earlier Colleges especially, anticipating the 
story of the University by many years. With the history of 
the Halls as a whole I have not attempted to deal fully. But
-P-A-G-E-10
x A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
the few which survived the sixteenth century have been treatedin 
some little detail. Tothe Monastic Colleges, which have vanished, 
I have given only a small space. But on both these points the 
materials available are generally slight. 
Among many subjects I have had to choose the most im- 
portant. The constitutional development of the University is 
becoming daily clearer in the hands of students like Mr. Gibson. 
The biographical material is abundant. Wood’s Athene, even 
allowing for criticism, is still a storehouse. The Dictionary of 
National Biography, if not immune from error, is invaluable for 
reference. Mr. J. Foster’s Alumni Oxonienses is a great achieve- 
ment. Memoirs are innumerable: and I have drawn on all 
such sources freely. With certain representative figures I have 
dealt more or less fully. Grosseteste, Roger Bacon, Wycliffe in 
the early days, Colet and Wolsey and the men of the Renaissance 
later, call for special notice. So do sixteenth and seventeenth 
century Chancellors like Leicester and Archbishop Laud, and 
Oxford types like Rainolds, Prideaux, Conant, Sheldon, Fell. 
But to many men of note I have been compelled to give short 
measure; and others who deserve notice I may have left un- 
named. To indicate the chief studies of Oxford from the Middle 
Ages onwards without going into wearisome detail is not altogether 
easy. Mr. Mullinger’s history of Cambridge University is dis- 
tinguished by its full treatment of this subject. My limits are 
narrower. Indeed, to keep a sense of proportion has been not 
the least difficult part of my task. Without plunging too deeply 
into scholastic problems I have tried to give some account of 
the methods of one or two of the most famous Schoolmen, and 
in this attempt I have had valuable help from Mr. A. G. Little 
and Mr. C. R. S. Harris. And I have said, I hope, enough to 
show the growth of the classical and philosophical tradition, the 
ascendency of logic and of Aristotle, the survival of Greek science, 
Roman language, Roman law, and the processes by which the 
Schoolmen, the men of the Renaissance, and the leaders of the 
Churches stamped their influence upon Oxford education and 
for so long held its development in check. 
For all these subjects many references have been needed, 
though I have limited notes and appendices as far as I could. 
When quoting phrases from Wood and others, which are well 
known or have been used elsewhere, or when referring to incidents 
the authorities for which have been completely given by earlier 
writers, I have reduced my references toa minimum. In quoting 
Wood’s works I have followed Dr. Clark in using the term Annals 
for Gutch’s edition of the History and Antiquities of the Uni- 
versity, Colleges for the History of the Colleges, and City for the 
Survey of the Antiquities of the City. I have used, of course,
-P-A-G-E-11
PREFACE xi 
Dr. Clark’s editions of Wood’s City and of Wood’s Life, and 
generally Bliss’ edition of the Aihene@. To save space, I have 
often omitted references to writers like Ayliffe, Chalmers and 
Ingram, whose work has been to some extent displaced, and I 
have not thought it necessary to repeat the useful list of authori- 
ties on Oxford history given by Dr. Rashdall at the beginning 
of his twelfth chapter. To Wood and Twyne, to the still older 
Cambridge antiquary, Robert Hare, who found time to collect 
two valuable volumes of Privilegia and Memorabilia for Oxford, 
to later antiquarians like William Smith of University College, 
and to many another collector, annalist and writer both before 
and since, many references are given in my notes. One or two 
recent volumes—by Mr. Salter-on the Merton College Register, 
by Mr. Richards on the Provosts and Fellows of Oriel, and by 
Mr. Gunther on early Oxford Science—appeared after my first 
volume was written. But I have where possible inserted refer- 
ences to them: Mr. Salter’s I was allowed to read in proof. 
As regards spellings of names, I have chosen those which seemed 
to me on the whole the best warranted and the most convenient. 
As regards illustrations, I have given one or two in each case to 
explain the College buildings. Loggan’s admirable drawings 
coincide with the end of the period treated here. The map 
which forms the frontispiece to Volume I has been drawn by 
Mr. Raymond Morgan under the supervision of Mr. Salter. 
It is founded on the map made by Mr. Hurst for Volume II of 
Dr. Clark’s edition of Wood’s City, with some corrections and 
with the grounds belonging to the Halls more clearly shown. 
The list of Halls is the list given by Dr. Clark in the preface to 
that volume. But it must not be assumed that the ninety-one 
Halls marked were all in existence in 1440, the approximate 
date given to the map. I have to thank the Oxford Historical 
Society, and the officials of the Bodleian Library, of the Clarendon 
Press and of the British Museum for permission to reproduce 
the maps and drawings given. And in one case, for the use of 
Hovenden’s Typus Collegit, I have to thank the Warden and 
Fellows of All Souls. 
I have acknowledged in my notes my great indebtedness 
to many distinguished Oxford scholars who have helped me, 
especially in connection with College history. Perhaps I might 
mention Dr. Watson of Christ Church, Mr. W. H. Stevenson of 
St. John’s, Mr. P. S. Allen of Merton, and Dr. Hazell of Jesus here. 
But I should like to add acknowledgments to others—though to 
one old friend, the late Master of Balliol, whose generous encour- 
agement never failed his pupils, it is vain to offer such a tribute 
now. I wish my acknowledgments to the Master of University 
to be paid both to Dr. Macan and to Sir Michael Sadler. I owe 
 
-P-A-G-E-12

special thanks to the Keeper of the Archives for his courteous 
assistance and his wise advice, to the officials of the Bodleian 
Library—Mr. Madan, Dr. Craster and Mr. Wheeler I have men- 
tioned elsewhere—to the Archbishop’s Librarian, Mr. Claude 
Jenkins, at Lambeth Palace, to the Registrary of the University 
and the Librarian of Corpus Christi College at Cambridge, in 
which I should like to include their Assistants, and to the Librarian 
of Trinity College, Dublin. I am under obligations, sometimes 
more than formal, to the officials of the British Museum Library, of 
the Record Office, and of the Society of Antiquaries. I owe thanks 
for help and information kindly given me to the Bishop of 
Worcester, the Dean of Bristol, the Sub-Dean of Lincoln, the 
Rev. Christopher Wordsworth, the Vicar of Ilminster and the 
Vicar of Great Tew; to Sir Charles Oman and Professor Tout ; 
to Dr. B. W. Henderson, Mr. G. C. Richards, Mr. R. T. Gunther ; 
to Sir Arthur Evans, Sir Thomas Jackson, Mr. Edmund New ; 
to Dr. Charles Singer and Dr. Arnold Chaplin; to Mr. G. P. 
Gooch ; to Sir J. A. R. Marriott, to Mr. Charles Llewelyn Davies, 
to Mr. C. H. Wilkinson of Worcester College, to Dr. Paget 
Toynbee, and not least to Mrs. R. L. Poole. And I would take 
this opportunity of thanking, for services rendered in this con- 
nection and for many older kindnesses as well, Dr. F. S. Boas, 
Professor Jack of Aberdeen, Sir Henry Newbolt and Sir Ludovic 
Grant.

A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY 
OF OXFORD 
CHAPTER I 
THE ORIGINS OF OXFORD 
of a city rose above the water-meadows where the 
Cherwell meets the Thames. The low slope, climbing 
up from the two rivers to the crossing of the four ways at the top, 
gave its shape to the narrow rectangle of the town. Saxons, 
Danes and Normans built upon it, crowned it with churches, 
encompassed it with walls. Monks set up in the fields around 
it altars and cloisters for pilgrimage and prayer. The Middle 
Ages took possession of it, and filled it with their genius and 
their dreams, their high-wrought, restless enterprise, their vain 
debates. And, as superstition widened into study, and the 
demand for knowledge refused to be repressed, teachers and 
scholars gradually made the place their own. The city grew. 
The crowded lanes found room for Colleges, each statelier, 
lovelier than the last: and in the new quadrangles the old con- 
flict between the tradition of authority and the spirit of revolt 
went on. Reformers won disciples, martyrs died there. Storms 
shook the Church and changed her, but her privileged domain 
survived. A King brought his lost cause to the decaying battle- 
ments. A Usurper, intolerant of privilege, swept King and 
Church and battlements away. And, as the old loyalties lapsed 
into indifference, the old customs were in peril of settling down 
into abuse. But through all changes, greater than the tradi- 
tions gathered round her, wiser than the prejudices which she 
has outgrown, saved by the new blood ever flowing through her 
as strongly as the waters underneath her walls, still young in 
heart and ineffaceable in beauty, Oxford lives, sharing her treas- 
ures ungrudgingly with those who seek them, her spirit with 
those that understand. A THOUSAND years have passed since the beginnings 
The early chroniclers of the University, however, were not 
satisfied to begin its history a thousand years ago. Imaginative

2 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
annalists in the Middle Ages, with whom it was a point of honour 
to claim a measureless antiquity for the Academy they loved, 
laboured to carry back its origins to fabled Kings—to Mempric 
who lived when Saul was reigning in Judea, to Brutus, the 
leader of the warlike Trojans, who first brought the Greek 
philosophers to Grekelade or Cricklade.t. More serious historians’ 
made Alfred the founder or restorer alike of the University and 
of the College which bore its name. A legend so flattering was 
readily accepted, even in circles where the critical instinct 
might have been expected to exist. The Master and Scholars 
of University College alleged it in a medieval law-suit. English 
judges showed little scruple in endorsing it. An Oxford arche- 
ologist inserted a passage to support it in Asser’s life of the 
great West Saxon King.? One celebrated historian of the six- 
teenth century? lent it his authority. Others discovered that 
in the nineteenth century it called for refutation still. But 
neither the College nor the University needs such uncertain 
ancestry to add to its renown. It is not till the reign of Alfred’s 
son that the town of Oxford is named in English history. It is 
not until two centuries later that the dim beginnings of the 
Oxford Schools appear. It was not till the intellectual awaken- 
ing of the twelfth century had founded an illustrious University 
in Paris, till Becket’s challenge to Henry II had raised issues 
which checked the flow of English students to the Seine, that 
the clerks of Oxford entered unconsciously into their national 
inheritance and the Schools under the shadow of St. Mary’s 
became a centre of study for the Northern world. 
For the earliest Universities of Europe there are no single 
founders, no certain dates to be assigned. As the darker ages 
passed away and men’s thoughts turned to learning once again, 
searching for a rule of right even in days of violent wrong-doing, 
searching for reasons to satisfy the doubter even in days when 
authority and dogma were supreme, the power of the teacher, 
never altogether lost, revived. Students gathered with strange 
enthusiasm, and if the records may be trusted in surprising 
numbers, wherever famous teachers made a school, travelling up 
1The legend is repeated in the Preface of the famous Chancellor’s 
Book (Registrum A. in the University Archives). 
The early myths on the subject are exhaustively discussed in the 
second chapter of Mr. James Parker’s Early History of Oxford (Oxford 
Historical Society). The myths about Alfred date from the days of 
Edward III. But Henry Savile of Banke, who was responsible for 
misleading Camden, must not be confused with Sir Henry Savile, the 
Warden of Merton. 
2 Camden did not die till 1623, and his edition of Asser’s Chronicle 
was published in 1603 ; but it is to the sixteenth century that most of his 
work belongs.
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE ORIGINS OF OXFORD 3 
from lonely districts, voyaging from distant countries, amid the 
daily perils of medizval life. The chief of these resorts sprang 
into European fame. A Studium Generale, where students from 
all parts assembled, began to be something more than a vague 
term. The Universitas, the whole body of Masters or students 
there collected,1 began to have something like a corporate 
existence, to adopt customs, to claim privileges, to form an 
organisation of its own. At Salerno, even before the eleventh 
century ended, there was a Medical School or College of Doctors 
celebrated enough to attract a Royal patient, Duke Robert of 
Normandy, returning from the First Crusade, and courtly enough 
to welcome as King of the English the Conqueror’s disinherited 
heir. In the twelfth century the two great primary Universities 
of Bologna and Paris definitely emerged. And in the vivid 
life, among the stirring controversies of that famous century, 
the University ideal at last took shape. 
But there were celebrated schools in many parts of Europe 
long before Irnerius lectured at Bologna, long before the daring 
eloquence of Abélard drew throhgs of eager students to the 
slopes of Ste. Geneviéve. Even in the darkest ages the tra- 
dition of learning had never died out. Stern Fathers of the 
Church like Jerome and Tertullian might denounce the writings 
of the heathen and proscribe the Pagan utterances of Greek 
philosophers and Latin poets.2 Reforming Popes like Gregory 
the Great might blush to find a Bishop teaching grammar, and 
Gregory’s successors might reiterate his maxim, “the same 
mouth singeth not the praises of Jove and the praises of Christ.” 
Yet Gregory’s writings helped the cause of education and were 
of service even to the literary tastes which he despised. The 
schools of the Monasteries might limit their teaching to the 
elements needed for monastic life—enough reading to study the 
Bible and the services of the Church, enough writing to make 
copies of the sacred books, enough arithmetic to calculate the 
date of the Church festivals, enough music to render the Church 
chants. The schools for priests which grew up in the shadow of 
the Cathedrals might sometimes content themselves with even 
less. The Roman schools might perish. The older seats of 
learning might disappear. But still, amid the darkness and 
disorder, amid the “seven-foot barbarians” in whose presence 
a fifth-century Bishop found six-foot hexameters impossible to 
write, some fragments of the classical tradition, some taste for 
1 The term University does not of course mean a place where all forms 
of knowledge are taught. 
2 Yet St. Jerome, as M. Ozanam points out in the eighth chapter of 
his History of Civilisation in the Fifth Century, found it impossible to 
abandon the classics, (See Glyn’s translation, I, 226-9.)
-P-A-G-E-28
    4 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
literature and some love of books survived. Boethius, standing 
between the old world and the new, left a great example of 
philosophy and learning. Cassiodorus abandoned statecraft to 
mould the education of the future. Gregory of Tours showed 
the sixth century what liveliness a medieval chronicle could 
contain. Gildas wrote history for the British and Jordanes for 
the Goths. Fortunatus of Poitiers sang in exuberant Latin 
the tragedies of Frankish Queens. Isidorus taught the teachers 
of the beginning of the seventh century, and Bede shone out 
at the end of it in splendour. In the far Monasteries of Ireland 
a rare enthusiasm for letters went hand in hand with mission- 
ary fervour. Irish scholars studied Greek. Irish Saints wrote 
Latin verses. Irish apostles wandered over Europe, carried 
their teaching to Iona, Malmesbury, Lindisfarne, planted 
churches in the heart of Germany, found protectors in the 
Frankish Kings. They displayed: no undue fear of Pagan 
learning, though they proved indomitable champions of the 
faith... At Canterbury Archbishop Theodore’s school produced 
scholars who, if Bede did not exaggerate, knew Greek and Latin 
as well as their mother tongue! At York the school of St. 
Peter’s rivalled the fame of Theodore’s foundation. The library 
which Bede used at Jarrow must have been full of treasures, 
if not one of the richest of the day.* The library at York, 
which Alcuin described in verse a little later, and which after 
the depredations of the Northmen few libraries perhaps of the 
twelfth century surpassed, contained copies of Virgil, Lucan, 
Cicero and Pliny, with fragments of Aristotle in Latin versions 
by Boethius, among the writings of the Fathers and the meagre 
text-books of the time. Within thirty years of Alcuin’s death 
a Roman Council under Pope Eugenius II was ready not only 
to tolerate but to enjoin the study of letters and the liberal 
arts, The Church might often draw back in alarm from the 
dangerous possibilities of knowledge. But in Northern Europe 
it was chiefly in the Church and through the clergy that learning 
in any shape survived. 
To Alcuin, the English scholar trained at York, and still 
more to the great Emperor who employed him, the education 
of the Middle Ages owes a memorable debt. The Palace School 
1 For many of these generalisations I am indebted to M. Ozanam’s 
History of Civilisation (passim), to A. W. Haddan’s Remains (258-94), to 
the chapter on the Schools of Ireland in M. Hauréau’s Singularités 
Historiques, to Prof. Ker’s illuminating little volume on The Dark Ages, 
to Dr. James’ recent and valuable survey in Chaps. XIX and XX of the 
third volume of the Cambridge Medieval History, and not least to Dr. 
R. L, Poole’s Illustrations of the History of Medieval Thought.

of Charles the Great set a new standard for the times, Cour- 
tiers, poets and nobles gathered round it, as well as the future 
leaders of the Church. The Royal circle set the fashion of 
inquiry, the untiring Emperor ever in the forefront with ques- 
tions which the teacher found it difficult to answer. The text- 
books of the Palace School were, no doubt, the text-books used 
at York. The Seven Liberal Arts comprised in the Trivium 
and Quadrivium were the basis of all secular education. The 
Trivium—Grammar, Rhetoric and Dialectic—included a smatter- 
ing of classics and philology, the study of Latin, the reading and 
writing of prose and verse.! It included probably the elements 
of Roman Law. It included also the study of logic, which 
opened the gates of philosophy and metaphysics, the key to a 
world of mystery which awed and fascinated the medieval 
mind. The Quadrivium, which led to a wider course of study 
as knowledge expanded and the available materials increased, 
consisted of Music, Arithmetic, Geometry and Astronomy, but 
it taught little at first beyond the elements of each. Music 
gave the rules for plain-song. Arithmetic helped to calculate 
the date of Easter. Geometry included geography, often in 
its details imaginative enough, and a few incomplete proposi- 
tions from Euclid. Astronomy explored the movements of the 
planets and unfolded the wisdom of the stars. But Alcuin had 
to fall back upon subterfuge to baffle the Emperor’s thirst for 
information when that elusive wisdom failed.? 
The Seven Liberal Arts of the Middle Ages, which came 
to be regarded as the foundation of knowledge, may trace their 
ancestry back to Plato, who furnished the medieval world with 
so many of its ideas. But we do not know for certain who is 
responsible for the number fixed or the selection made.* There 
is no obvious reason why the list should have excluded arts like 
architecture and medicine, which were widely acknowledged as 
1 Grammar, which meant learning Latin, might be expanded to cover 
a good deal of Latin literature. £ 
2 See Mr. J. B. Mullinger’s Schools of Charles the Great (88). Others 
besides M. Hauréau (De la Philosophie Scolastique, ed, 1850, I, 19) have 
recalled the old distich : 
“Gramm loquitur, Dia verba docet, Rhet verba colorat, 
Mus canit, Ay numerat, Geo ponderat, Ast colit astra.” 
8 St. Augustine, it seems, would have preferred six to seven. Varro 
and Plutarch would probably have made them nine. Mr. H. Parker 
(English Historical Review, 1890, 417-61) gives grounds for thinking that 
Martianus Capella-was chiefly responsible for the famous list, and that 
Cassiodorus helped to stereotype the selection made. Mr. Parker argues 
with some force that Martianus Capella was an African farmer who wrote 
before 330, much earlier than most scholars have allowed, and that he 
founded his list upon the works of Varro, a contemporary of Cicero and 
Cesar. The tradition was of course much older than Martianus,

liberal studies. There is still less reason why the Church, had 
she been free to choose, should have allowed it to include a 
dangerous study like astronomy, which bordered on astrology 
and magic, or even a suspected science like mathematics, which 
Suetonius associated with fortune-telling and St. Augustine 
lamented as sin. But the Church probably accepted a tradition 
long established, as a groundwork on which the higher studies, 
especially theology, might build. It can hardly be contended 
that the Seven Arts at any time represented the sum of human 
knowledge, all that was thought worth studying by the medieval 
world. But they did represent for many generations, in days 
when education was still struggling for existence, the frame- 
work of the most familiar learning which a greater civilisation 
had adopted and approved. 
The school-books of Alcuin’s day were few and meagre. But 
for centuries they held the field. The groundwork of education 
differed little as the years went on. Donatus and Priscian were 
the ruling grammarians,! against whose authority St. Gregory 
rebelled in vain. The Histories of Orosius, written by a pupil 
of Augustine, translated by King Alfred and praised by Dante, 
tried to comfort Christians by recalling the calamities which 
had happened to the world in Pagan times. But they contributed 
little to the cause of learning or the gaiety of mankind. Martianus 
Capella had a far greater reputation. His fantastic allegory on 
the nuptials of Philology and Mercury, in which the Seven Arts 
appeared as virgins assigned by Mercury to attend upon his 
bride, made a strong appeal to the student world. His imagina- 
tive pedantry, his simple, obvious humour, his ornamental and 
indifferent Latin, won favour from an early date in Ireland, 
and achieved universal popularity as generations passed. He 
handed down a school tradition which became indispensable to 
the Middle Ages. But his vein of semi-pagan speculation roused 
distrust in the schools where Alcuin taught. With Boethius, 
however, there was no such reason for reserve. The great Roman 
scholar, who served in turn as Minister and victim to Theodoric, 
cannot claim to rank as a Christian martyr. But his educational 
writings had profound importance, and his noble treatise on 
the Consolation of Philosophy struck a rare note of simplicity 
and clearness in the confusion of medieval thought. Princes 
and poets combined to do him honour. Churchmen and philo- 
sophers for uncounted generations recognised the beauty of the 
vision which he longed for. His books on music, arithmetic

and Euclid, his commentaries on the Isagoge of Porphyry—an 
introduction to Aristotle which nearly every student used—his 
works on logic and his translations of Aristotle, imperfectly known 
for a long time as they were,’ made Boethius the greatest name 
among the teachers of the Middle Ages, and from one famous 
sentence in his version of the Isagoge the Scholastic debate of 
those ages took its rise. Cassiodorus, a colleague and admirer 
of Boethius, less illusttious but more fortunate than he, devoted 
to the pursuit of knowledge and the education of the clergy no 
small part of a long and busy life. In the peace and orthodoxy 
of the religious House which he had founded he wrote on Scripture 
and history, on logic and grammar, and even more meagrely on 
other themes. But he taught his monks to read. His treatise 
on the Liberal Arts gave a fresh sanction to the old tradition. 
It became a necessary hand-book for students. And if it seems 
to us slight and confused, it yet carried the teaching of the time 
and the study of dialectic further than before.2 To Alcuin’s 
pupils Boethius and Cassiodorus must have been familiar names. 
But Isidorus, Bishop of Seville, had left behind him twenty 
books of Ezymologies,® illustrated by passages from early Latin 
writers, which also summed up on almost every subject the 
insufficient knowledge of the day. And Bede, the first of English 
historians * and the father of English letters, had already con- 
tributed his memorable labours to the slow and narrow stream 
of learning. 
How slowly and narrowly that stream flowed at the end of 
the eighth century no one realised more clearly than the strong, 
impatient genius whom Alcuin undertook to serve. Charles 
the Great gave a new impulse to medieval education. But even 
his unresting energy could not transform his world. When the 
Emperor sighed for twelve clergy in his realm as learned as 
1 Boethius’ treatises on logic and his translation of the Isagoge were 
in general use. But his version of the De Initerpretatione was the only 
part of his translations of Aristotle known in Alcuin’s day. The Categories, 
which Boethius had translated, were known only in an abridgment wrongly 
attributed to St. Augustine. Dean Rashdall (The Universities of Europe 
in the Middle Ages, App. XIV) doubts whether Boethius translated all 
the books of the Organon, as has been supposed. 
®See his treatise De Artibus ac Disciplinis Liberalium Litterarum, in 
Migne (Patrologig Cursus Completus, tom. 70). Dr. R. James goes so far 
as to call Cassiodorus ‘‘ the greatest individual contributor to the preserva- 
tion of learning in the West’? (Camb. Med. Hist. III, 486). 
They occupy nearly the whole of tom. 82 of ‘Migne—a curious 
miscellany of information, beginning with grammar, rhetoric, mathematics, 
medicine, and passing on to almost every subject from God and the 
angels to the nations and arts and employments of men. 
« Strictly speaking, the life of Wilfred by Eddius is older than Bede’s 
History, and Adamnan’s Life of St. Columba is still earlier. Bede wrote 
educational books too.

Jerome or Augustine, Alcuin drew back, shocked by such 
immoderate demands. ‘‘ The Lord of heaven and earth had but 
two such, and thou wouldst have twelve!’’ When he threw 
himself into the labours of the class-room, struggled hard to 
learn to write, propounded shrewd problems in grammar or 
science, gave orders for manuscripts to be collected and revised, 
Charles set an example which his age was hardly yet prepared 
to follow. His famous Capitularies enjoined the study of letters 
in all the Bishoprics and Monasteries of his realm, and established 
schools in every Abbey, where music and singing, arithmetic 
and grammar could be learned. Some Monasteries, taking the 
lead in the new movement, threw open their teaching to young 
clerks who were not vowed to the monastic life, and one of Charles’ 
Bishops even laboured to establish schools in every town and 
village, where all the children of the faithful could be taught 
without payment if their parents wished. But both monastic 
and cathedral schools were founded for ecclesiastics. It was 
for the service of the Church and as the handmaid of religion 
that education had its chief value in medieval days. 
If Charles’ achievements fell short of his ideals, his successors 
proved unable to carry on his work. Here and there indeed, in 
the break-up of the Frankish Empire, in the desolation wrought 
by Northmen in the North and Saracens in the South, the tradition 
of learning lingered on. At Orleans and Rheims great Bishops 
had already built up celebrated schools, and Louis the Pious 
was urged by his prelates to establish at least three public schools 
in his dominions, that the labours of his father might not ‘‘ utterly 
decay and perish.” ‘In some large Monasteries, where discipline 
persisted and men found time to meditate on knowledge, libraries 
were still collected and the habit of study maintained. Far 
away, beyond the Rhine, Rabanus, Alcuin’s pupil, made the 
Monastery school of Fulda the most famous of its day, a place 
where grammar and dialectic were accepted as valuable and even 
noble studies. His teaching showed a width and liberality 
rarely found in his own generation, and his pupils included many 
of the best-known teachers of the next. Charles the Bald 
welcomed the scholars from Ireland who flocked to his Court 
“regardless of the barrier of the sea,’ as readily as his grand- 
father had welcomed both Englishmen and Irishmen in Alcuin’s 
day; and the most brilliant of them, John the Scot, Erigena, 
with his keen wit and his deep originality, flashed like a meteor 
through the.darkness of the time. Called in by an Archbishop 
to write on a question of theology,1 Erigena applied himself 
1 Gottschalk’s far-pressed doctrine of Predestination, to which Arch- 
bishop Hincmar requiredareply. Dr. R. L. Poole (Iilusts. of Med. Thought) 
has a valuable account of John Scot’s work. Dr. Harnack (Hist. of

to dialectic and philosophy with a speculative boldness which 
amazed his world. He appealed to the wisdom of Greek thinkers 
to expand and illuminate the problems of the faith. He demanded 
for the Bible narrative a wide interpretation. He found in man’s 
intelligence the dwelling-place of the word of God. He claimed 
for human thought a new supremacy, and challenged the claims 
of all authority which reason could not grasp and approve.t 
And if his daring raised a cry of heresy and startled the timider 
thinkers of his day, his works were remembered by generations 
after him as “ illustrious monuments in the Church of God,” and 
they foreshadowed in their range and methods the great 
controversy with which the Schools of the Middle Ages were 
to ring. 
John the Scot paid the penalty for his opinions. His books 
were banned. But his free spirit was not extinguished. A 
succession of illustrious teachers carried on the tradition which 
Alcuin and Rabanus had bequeathed. Monkish chroniclers still 
found romance and humour in the world about them.? There 
was valuable teaching at Reichenau and St. Gall. Remy of 
Auxerre, inspired by his own great teacher Heiric, drew eager 
scholars to the Schools of Paris. His pupil Odo made Cluny a 
centre of learning as well as a model of the monastic life. Arch- 
bishop Bruno, the brother of the great Emperor Otto, summoned, 
it is said, an Irish Bishop to assist him in restoring the ruined 
fabric of the Seven Liberal Arts. Bruno. read everything, even 
Latin comedies, and carried his library with him “as it had 
been the ark of the Lord.” A still greater prelate, Gerbert, 
the omniscient Master, the mathematician and philosopher whose 
dangerous learning won for him, Pope as he was, the doubtful 
fame of a magician later, encouraged his students to read not 
only Aristotle and Boethius, but Virgil and Juvenal, Terence 
and Horace.* Under Gerbert’s pupil Fulbert, the well-loved 
and saintly scholar who gathered his young disciples round him

“‘ with him the knowledge of God and of nature coincide.” He has some 
useful comments also on Gottschalk and Rabanus (VI, 293 sq.). Among 
other authorities Stéckl (Geschichte dey Philosophie des Mittelalters, I, 
31-128) deals fully with Erigena, whose great work De Divisione Nature, 
which Prof. Ker calls ‘‘the one purely philosophical argument of the 
Middle Ages,” is printed by Migne (tom. 122).

in the garden of the Cathedral school at Chartres, that school 
acquired a fame second to none in Western Europe. Berengar 
of Tours, as the eleventh century proceeded, disdained the safe 
limits within which Fulbert taught, and used the art of dialectic 
and the power of reason to explore the mystery of Transubstan- 
tiation, to probe the dogma which was rapidly becoming the 
central dogma of the Catholic Church. And Lanfranc, from 
the rising school of Bec, took up the challenge and laboured to 
confute him, without Berengar’s mastery of logic, but with the 
confidence which orthodoxy only could inspire. But teachers 
of high fame like these and others were at best rare voices in 
a wide space of time. It was not till the end of the eleventh 
century, till the German Emperors had re-established order and 
entered on their ill-fated contest with the Popes, till the race of 
Hugh Capet was seated on the throne in Paris and the sons of 
William the Norman were disputing for the English Crown, 
till Hildebrand’s intrepid claims had opened to the clergy new 
fields of dominion and spiritual power, that the darkness of the 
earlier ages disappeared, and men’s minds, turning afresh to the 
pursuit of knowledge, began to stir the philosophic issues which 
were to make the Schools of Paris a battle-ground of conflict, 
and the headquarters of the intellectual ferment from which the 
Universities of modern Europe rose. 
It is impossible here to follow in detail, it is equally impossible 
to ignore altogether, the Scholastic debate which played so 
commanding a part in the thought and education of the Middle 
Ages. Pedantic, formal, trivial it often was, artificial in its 
methods, bewildering in its distinctions. A great English 
scholar of the twelfth century could condemn the dialectical 
subtleties it led to as shadows of things that flee and vanish 
away.! A Pope could reduce it to something like absurdity by 
emphasising the importance of the nominative case when predicat- 
ing the essence of God.? But nevertheless dialectic became the 
favourite instrument of thought, and the Scholastic issues the 
dominant issues with the best minds of the Middle Age. Rebel 
as they sometimes might against authority, the thinkers of the 
day moved always in an atmosphere of traditional religion. 
Their chief aim was to reconcile its teaching with the growing 
demands of philosophy and learning. Latin was studied as the 
language spoken by the Church. Logic was an instrument for 
explaining its theology. From theology their science started, 
and to theology they traced all issues back. Plato’s ideas were 
in the first place worth recovering because they seemed to throw

light on the nature of God. Aristotle was recognised as a Master 
because his method of analysis helped to elucidate the problems 
of the faith. Limited as were the materials of those who plunged 
into the great discussion, even after fresh discoveries and trans- 
lations had added to their knowledge of the teachers of the past, 
its influence on the three or four centuries which followed the 
Norman conquest of England was profound. It was from the 
medieval Schoolmen that our forefathers learned to think, and 
the traces of their studies and their system are deeply stamped 
on English education yet. 
The early teachers of the Middle Ages knew very few of 
Plato’s writings! and very little of his philosophy beyond his 
doctrine of Ideas. Of Aristotle they knew only translations of 
portions of his treatises on logic, even when Abélard was at the 
zenith of his fame. It was not till the succeeding generation 
that the whole of the Organon became available for students. » 
It was not until the thirteenth century that Aristotle’s science 
and philosophy dawned in their splendour on Western Europe. 
But even these fragments of translations had an extraordinary 
influence on medizval thought. From the days of John the 
Scot dialecticians and theologians had noted the issue between 
the two great schools of philosophy, which was to engross the 
thinkers of Europe for centuries to come. The absorbing debate 
on the nature of being had begun. The meaning and reality 
of genus and species, of differences and accidents, of the general 
terms known as Universals, became the favourite topics of the 
Schools. The Realists, seeking with Plato to explore a spiritual 
and immaterial world, found the only real existence in ideas, 
drawn from some source eternal and divine, in abstract, inspired 
conceptions of truth and goodness, of wisdom, beauty, humanity 
and the like. In the visible world around them they found 
only more or less imperfect reproductions of these unchangeable 
ideas. The Nominalists, following Aristotle’s method more 
boldly sometimes than the Church approved, maintained that 
these Universals, these general conceptions, were names, sounds, 
phrases only, which had no existence apart from the senses and 
experience of men, and claimed that it was with the individual 
intellect, and not with such impalpable abstractions, that the 
pursuit of the secret of existence must begin.”

12 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
“The question concerning genera and species ’’—so ran the 
celebrated sentence in Boethius’ translation of the Isagoge of 
Porphyry, which launched the whole debate—“ whether they 
have a substantial existence or are found only in bare concepts 
of the mind; whether, supposing them to have a substantial 
existence, they are corporeal or incorporeal ; and whether again 
they are found apart from things which the senses can perceive, 
or exist in those things and with them and about them, I shall 
forbear to say. For this kind of question is a very deep one and 
demands a fuller investigation.” + 
Each side found vigorous advocates. The Realists, wrapped 
in contemplation of invisible and unsubstantial things, had little 
difficulty in reconciling their conceptions with the authority 
and traditions of the Church. When Berengar questioned the 
miracle of Transubstantiation, the transformation of the bread 
and wine into the body and blood of Christ, Realism stepped in 
to distinguish between the invisible substance, the Universal, 
which the priest could change, and the visible accidents or 
adjuncts which remained.?- The Nominalist, on the other hand, 
relied on analysis and inquiry, on arguments drawn from human 
perception and experience, and were led to apply the test of 
reason to the mysteries and dogmas of the faith. Before the end 
of the eleventh century Roscellinus had challenged the doctrine 
of universal substances afresh, and had startled the world by 
employing the principles of logic.to examine the nature of the 
Trinity itself. In vain the heads of the Church denounced or 
discouraged a logic and philosophy which they had learned to 
fear. In vain Anselm, “the last of the Fathers” and the first 
philosopher among the prelates of his day, brought his serene 
faith and his inspiring metaphysics to quell the doubts which 
Roscellinus had provoked. “‘ Credo ut intelligam,” cried Anselm. 
The faithful believed in order to understand. The idea of God 
in the mind of man was the real proof of His existence. It was 
from the sure ground of authority that every inquirer in theology 
must start, though reason as well as revelation was available to 
help him in his search for truth. In vain William of Champeaux, 
“the Pillar of Doctors,” whose fame as-a teacher at Paris dates 
from the latter years of Anselm’s life, tried to defend the Realist 
1 Mox de generibus et speciebus illud quidem sive subsistant sive in 
solis nudis intellectibus posita sint, sive subsistentia corporalia sint an 
incorporalia, et utrum separata a sensibilibus an in sensibilibus posita et 
circa hec consistentia, dicere recusabo; altissimum enim negotium est 
hujusmodi et majoris egens inquisitionis.”” Boethius’ version of the Greek 
might perhaps be improved on, but it was from his version that the 
controversy took its rise.

position in formulas which both logic and orthodoxy could accept. 
The spirit of inquiry was now thoroughly awake. And Abélard, 
descending on the Schools of Paris with the assurance of genius 
and the intrepidity of youth, raised in the name of religion 
and philosophy a revolt which not even St. Bernard could 
subdue. 
Many generations have retold the story of Abélard’s triumphs 
and tragedy and shame. He was not only a scholar, an orator, 
a brilliant teacher. He was the most arresting and stimulating 
mind in an age newly conscious of its intellectual powers. In 
a day of half-dead formulas, his fearless logic seemed vividly 
alive. Ina day when man’s intelligence was bound and fettered, 
his free spirit seemed to face unflinchingly the utmost consequences 
of his thought. And the philosophy which scorned discretion, 
the self-confidence, the combativeness, the very human frailties 
revealed by his romantic story and mingled with his extraordi- 
nary gifts, while they scandalised the Doctors whom he bearded, 
won the hearts and the imaginations of the boys who crowded 
round his chair. St. Bernard, his relentless censor and assailant, 
complained that Abélard peered into the heavens and searched _ 
the hidden mysteries of God, that he discoursed most rashly 
on things of which no man may speak, that his pestilent books 
flew abroad all over the world. Reverent in essentials and 
Christian to the core, Abélard brought all the forces of his reason 
to examine and illuminate every problem which he touched. 
He claimed complete liberty of judgment in studying authorities. 
He recognised the possibility of textual errors, of mistranslation 
even in the sacred books. He criticised the views of Roscellinus 
as boldly as those of William of Champeaux, insisting indeed 
with the Nominalists on the real existence of the individual, 
but allowing that abstract Universals might have a real existence 
also as concepts of the human mind. But the Nominalist habit 
of inquiry Abélard made his own. Revelation and authority 
were sacred to him, but he must argue out their conclusions 
for himself. ‘“‘It is not because God has said a thing that we 
believe it, but because we are convinced that it is so.” It was 
the fearlessness of his appeal to reason which the timider minds 
that condemned him could not either answer or forgive. 
Abélard fell, but his spirit triumphed. The intellectual 
tumult which he had stirred could not be silenced by any sentence 
of the Church. Monkish piety flowed on, but the seculars kept 
the lead in education. The world, cried a monkish historian, 
“had cast aside its old garment.” New ideals were claiming 
dominion over the souls of men. Other schools, at Laon and 
at Chartres, other teachers of no mean reputation, bore witness 
to the eager quest for learning which was the charm and wonder

14 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
of the age. Anselm of Laon was known as “ the Doctor of 
Doctors,”’ and flouted by Abélard as a barren fig-tree. Gilbert 
de la Porrée, the subtle dialectician persecuted like Abélard by 
St. Bernard, was a writer on logic whose authority only Aristotle 
himself surpassed. Bernard Sylvester of Chartres, ‘‘ the most 
abounding spring of letters in Gaul,” was a scholar and grammarian 
who found an allegory in the Aneid and in Aineas a symbol 
of the soul. But the Abélard tradition, helped by the attraction 
of Paris, was supreme. Students from England, from Germany, 
from every part of Europe, flocked to the school which he had 
made so famous, and the method of teaching which he had brought 
to such perfection became the model of the University system 
of the future. Councils of the Church might censure him, but 
twenty of his pupils became Cardinals, and more than fifty, it 
is stated, Bishops. One of his pupils, Peter the Lombard, en- 
deavoured to satisfy and quiet speculation by collecting and 
harmonising the opinions of the Fathers on the theology of the 
Church, and produced in his book of Sentences a text-book so 
universally adopted that it gave rise to no fewer than a hundred 
and sixty commentaries by English theologians alone.1 Another, 
Arnold of Brescia,? shocked by the contrast between the Church’s 
lofty and eternal aims and the clergy’s pursuit of wealth and 
temporal power, carried the spirit of revolt into another sphere. 
And a third, John of Salisbury, who as a boy had listened “ with 
entire greediness of mind” to the entrancing teacher of Ste. 
Geneviéve, and who stood later by the side of Becket in the 
greatest struggle for independence yet waged by the English 
Church, was in many respects the most typical representative 
of the scholars of his day. 
We know John of Salisbury almost as a friend from the 
writings he has left behind him. He spent some ten or twelve 
years in France in education, studying in turn logic and grammar, 
dialectic and theology under the most famous masters of the 
time. Two of his teachers became English Bishops, while a 
third, Robert Pullen, if the tradition may be trusted, had already 
lectured in the Oxford Schools. At Chartres, where long after- 
1 The four books of the Sentences (published in Migne, Pat. Curs. Comp., 
Series Secunda, tom. I.) dealt with the Mystery of the Trinity, the Creation, 
the Incarnation of the Word, the Sacraments, and with doctrines like 
Free Will, Original Sin, the Resurrection of the Dead, etc. (See Hist. 
Litérairve de la France, II, 589 sq., and Mullinger’s University of Cambridge, 
I, 59.) They supplied a logical argument for the doctrines of theology, 
and had an extraordinary vogue. 
2 St. Bernard’s statements are the chief, if not the sole, authority for 
regarding Arnold as a pupil of Abélard. Dr. Rashdall has a valuable 
chapter (Universities, I, Ch. II) on Abélard and the Renaissance of the 
Twelfth Century.

  THE ORIGINS OF OXFORD 15 
wards he reigned himself as Bishop, John learned to love the 
classics, and to contrast them with the “‘ bloodless and barren ” 
study of dialectic, which was always unravelling the ancient 
problems. Mankind had already grown old, he pleaded, in 
trying to solve Porphyry’s questions, and more time had been 
spent on them than “ the House of Cesar spent in winning and 
in ruling the Empire of the World.’ John was the friend of 
Hadrian IV, the one and only English Pope. He was frequently 
employed in missions to Rome. He passed the Alps ten times 
on his journeys, and he has left in one letter a poignant description 
of his efforts to write on that ‘‘ place of torment,” the Great 
St. Bernard, where his ink-bottle proved to be a mass of ice, 
his beard and fingers stiff with frost, and his breath “‘ congealed 
into a long icicle.’”’ He was secretary to Archbishop Theobald 
and afterwards to Thomas Becket. He shared the great Arch- 
bishop’s exile. He was a witness of the murder which convulsed 
the Church of Christendom, and a wise and temperate champion 
of the cause for which St. Thomas died. But it is as the chief 
representative of English learning, as a link between the 
intellectual movements in France and in England which led to 
the growth of Universities in both, that John of Salisbury calls 
for record here. He sat at the feet of Abélard “on Mount 
Saint Genovefa.” He saw Paris grow under Abélard’s successors 
into the first city of teachers in the medieval world. He saw 
the foreign-born? scholars of Paris driven out in 1167 for a 
season. He saw, though he has failed to note it, the University 
of Oxford rise. 
Englishmen flocked to the Schools of Paris. But teachers 
from England had already played no small part in civilising 
Europe, and from very early days there had been schools of 
repute in many English towns. Canterbury had been renowned 
for its scholars centuries before Archbishop Theobald made it 
the home of something like University teaching. York had 
kept up Alcuin’s tradition. Winchester had been associated 
with Alfred’s work for education. Dunstan after the Danish 
invasions had relit the flame of learning, and all through the dark 
days that followed the Monasteries had kept that flame alive. 
Canute and Harold had founded schools afresh. In many

  16 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Midland towns, it seems, schools had grown up round Collegiate 
‘churches. Warwick claims a succession of scholars before and 
after the Norman Conquest. Fitzstephen, Becket’s friend and 
biographer, speaks of three church schools in London, whose 
scholars flocked on summer evenings to the sweet, clear springs 
of Clerkenwell. Rivers and fountains, springs and woods were 
long regarded as essential to a place of study. But the Schools 
of Oxford probably owed their reputation largely at first to the 
importance of the town. The origin of the town itself is dim 
and misty. No Roman colony, no British camp, no early 
Bishopric brought it sanctity or fame. But from time imme- 
morial the gravel slope between the Thames and the Cherwell, 
where the cattle-ford crossed the streams among the marshes 
and the track from North to South met the river flowing East, 
must have seemed a suitable place for settlement and for 
protection. The main lines of its rectangle, its ways and cross- 
ways and the sites of its churches, were latgely planned in Saxon 
days.1 In the struggle of the Saxon Kingdoms Oxford at length 
became a border town, for which the Kings of Wessex and of 
Mercia probably contended. In 912, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle 
tells us, Edward the Elder took it for his own. Its central 
position made it a convenient meeting-place. Its command of 
the river gave it strategical importance. Edward may well 
have set to work to strengthen it, and have fortified the ground 
on which the Castle stands. Danish invaders found their way 
to Oxford, and sacked and burned it more than once. Danish 
chiefs were murdered in its precincts. Danish and English 
Kings alike held Courts and summoned Councils there. Canute 
gave to the monks of Abingdon the “little minster”’ of St. 
Martin’s, the central parish of the town, and in Oxford Canute’s 
sons were chosen to succeed him. We have a glimpse of Earl 
Harold in Council there later, and a tradition, which rests on 
no solid foundation, of William the Conqueror besieging the city. 
But even before the Conquest its prosperity had suffered, and 
many of its houses, it would seem, had been laid waste. As 
William laid his strong hand upon England, Robert d’Oili the 
Norman established his hold upon Oxford, and within six years

Carfax is traceable 11 ft. 7 in. below the present road (Headlam, Oxford 
and its Story, 59,n.). In his Introduction to An Archeological Survey of 
Oxfordshire, communicated to the Society of Antiquaries (Arch@ologia, 
vol. LXXI), Mr. E. Thurlow Leeds sums up what little can be said of 
pre-Saxon settlements at Oxford, usually in the Northern suburbs. The 
Roman way from Bicester to Dorchester passed within a mile or two on 
the East. But there could have been no important Roman settlement 
at Oxford, and no great Roman road came very near,

THE ORIGINS OF OXFORD Er 
of the victory at Hastings he began to build his Castle on a 
mound towards the West.+ 
Besides these few facts there is a legendary history, which 
contains, it may be, a large element of truth. Whether or not 
St. Frideswide, the daughter of King Didanus of Oxford, who 
reigned “about the year of our Lord’s incarnation 726,” fled 
from the lover who incontinently pursued her into the fastnesses 
of Binsey Wood, and issuing thence, when miracles had attested 
her divine vocation and her persecutor, struck with blindness, 
had repented of his sin, founded a Nunnery where Christ Church 
stands, there is nothing improbable in the very old tradition 
which places an early Convent on the spot. The Monastery of 
Abingdon, a larger and wealthier foundation, already claimed, 
from the seventh century onwards, grants of land towards the 
South and West. At the dawn of the eleventh century St. 
Frideswide’s still existed, but its Nuns had been replaced by 
Canons, and its church was burned, with the Danes who sheltered 
in it, during the memorable massacre of St. Brice’s day. Soon 
afterwards King Athelred, the author of the massacre, restored 
the ruined minster and founded the Monastery afresh. In the 
years that followed, however, the Canons of St. Frideswide’s 
played little part in local history. They were quite eclipsed by 
,the great House at Abingdon, whose possessions stretched to 
‘Hinksey, Wytham, Bagley Wood, and whose Abbot levied on 
the Oxford boatmen a toll of a hundred herrings for each boat 
that passed in Lent. Nor was Abingdon the only rival that St. 
Frideswide’s had to face. As early as the days of Athelred 
another Monastery had risen among the Eynsham fields. After 
the Conquest Robert d’Oili built a Collegiate Church to St. 
George in his Castle. His nephew founded a statelier Abbey at 
Oseney among the reedy islands of theriver. And in Stephen’s 
days the Convent of Godstow, not yet enriched by fair Rosamund’s 
frailty, grew up beside the waterfall and beyond the Binsey woods. 
The growth of these religious Houses increased the company of | 
clerks in Oxford, and can hardly have failed to stimulate schools 
and teaching. But wehave no solid ground for tracing back the 
origins of the University system to the ancient cloisters of St. 
Frideswide’s or to the dim traditions of the Monasteries round.? 
12Mr. James Parker’s Early History of Oxford contains a careful 
discussion of the facts and theories of early Oxford history. See also 
Freeman’s Norman Conquest (IV, 188 and App. Z, ed. 1871) and English 
Towns and Districts, and J. R. Green’s Studies in Oxford History (Ch. I).

  18 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
With Henry I and his successors, however, a new chapter 
begins. Oxford was now a prosperous town, with its market, 
its mills, its merchant-guild, its great Port-meadow stretching 
far beyond the walls. But it was a place of clerks and churches 
too. St. Martin’s was the earliest of Oxford parishes, and its 
church, essentially the townsmen’s church, stood, as its tower 
stands yet, by the cross-roads in the centre, where the market 
stalls clustered and the town meetings were held. St. Mary’s 
already had close-packed lanes about it, and priests, no doubt, 
giving simple teaching in its aisles. St. Michael’s by the North 
Gate overlooked the town’s defences, and like St. Peter’s in 
the East and St. Mary Magdalen’s outside the walls bore witness 
to the pride or penitence of Robert d’Oili. Another St. Peter’s 
and another St. Michael’s probably protected gates on the West 
and South. St. Mildred’s recalled a Mercian Saint, a grand- 
daughter of the old heathen Penda. St. Aldate’s, assigned to 
a Celtic patron, possibly recalled no Saint at all1 Within the 
Castle precincts St. George’s Canons may have taught. The 
territory of St. Frideswide ran towards the river. To the East, 
on the road out of Oxford, King Henry planted a hospital with 
a leper-house attached. And to the North he not only built a 
hunting-lodge at Woodstock, and stocked a park with “‘ lions, 
leopards and strange spotted beasts,” but he laid out a Palace 
near the river-side at Beaumont, which became for a time a 
home for his descendants, and gave them a special interest in 
the fortunes of the place. 
Henry I, we are told, was “‘a person of great literature,” 
who delighted in the conversation of the Oxford clerks. But 
his celebrated grandson was much more. Henry II fills as large 
a space as any in the roll of early English Kings. None of them 
perhaps was greater as soldier, law-giver, administrator, diplo- 
matist combined. None for many years ruled such wide 
dominions. None was more incessant in activities, readier to 
seek experience of every kind. Insatiable in his love of work, 
immoderate in his love of hunting, remorseless in the way he 
moved his Court about, Henry loved his books as a scholar 
loves them, and was as eager in his reading as in all he undertook. “ 
finally to Regular Canons, probably in 1122. About that time William of 
Malmesbury speaks of them as “‘ very few ”’ (De Gest. Pontif., ed. Hamilton, 
316) : but Guimond or Guymundus the Prior was a distinguished man— 
“admirably well learned,’” says Wood, ‘according to those times” 
(Annals, I, 137). See also Parker’s Early Oxford (138-40 and 165-9), 
and Rashdall’s Universities (II, 327 and 335, n.). Eynsham was founded 
afresh after the Norman Conquest. 
1 Mr. James Parker thought that the name might be a corruption of 
Aldgate (Early Hist. of Oxford, 290-5). But Mr. Boase (Oxford, 5) accepts 
St, Aldate as a Celtic saint. It is not unlike St, Eldad.
-P-A-G-E-43
  
THE ORIGINS OF OXFORD 19 
He delighted in working out knotty points with the clerks who 
served him. With the King of England, wrote Peter of Blois, 
there was “‘ school every day.’”’ To Henry, as to his ancestor 
Fulk the Good, a vex illiteratus was an asinus coronatus,* and the 
historians, lawyers, churchmen, whom he gathered round him, 
were among the most learned and enlightened of the time. The 
King himself was often in Oxford. His son Richard was born at 
Beaumont. His son John was probably born at Woodstock. 
The chief romance of his life is linked with Godstow. His visits 
must have increased the town’s importance. His far-reaching 
schemes of policy brought travellers from every country to his 
Court. English scholars who were Henry’s subjects, like John 
of Poitiers and John of Salisbury, were promoted to great 
Continental Sees. An English Pope, a pupil of the Monastery 
of St. Albans, for the only time in history filled the Papal chair. 
The Dean of St. Paul’s, Ralph de Diceto, himself no mean 
historian, encouraged his Cathedral Canons to improve their 
minds by studying abroad. Bishop Foliot, Becket’s celebrated 
tival, sent his young Archdeacons to Bologna, to defy the 
temptations—brawls, debts and love-adventures—to which 
Archdeacons were supposed to be peculiarly prone.? Walter 
Map, Archdeacon of Oxford and poet and satirist to boot, whose 
name tradition has obstinately linked with a favourite drinking- 
song of the Middle Ages, and who on evidence no stronger has 
been credited with the creation of Arthurian romance, was a 
student of Paris, like many of the best English scholars of his 
time. But his name is found attesting deeds at Oxford, and 
he must often have resided there. A College was planned at 
Lambeth which might have made London the first of English 
Universities. The Archbishop’s Palace at Canterbury was a 
literary centre second in reputation to none in the country, a 
“camp of God,” a ‘‘ gate of Heaven.”’ Becket’s household in- 
cluded something not unlike a staff of Professors. At Winchester 
Bishop Henry, a grandson of the Conqueror, still in his old age 
drew men of learning round him. At Salisbury the Dean, John 
of Oxford, bore a name which almost seems to suggest the 
University of the future. At Peterborough and St. Albans, at 
Newburgh and Hexham, monks were busily copying manuscripts, 
2 See his letter ‘‘ad Walterum Archiepisc. Panormitanum ”’ in Migne 
(tom. 207, pp. 195-9). Bishop Stubbs quotes the passage in his Lectures 
on Mediaeval and Modern History (Chap. VII, p. 143), from which some of 
the following details are drawn. See also Mrs. Green’s volume on Henry 
the Second.

20 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
chroniclers were steadily writing history. England, says a fine 
judge, might well have been called a paradise of clerks. Nowhere 
else in Europe outside Paris was such a supply of writers and 
readers to be found. And the Latin prose which they wrote 
with such facility, the Latin verse which they produced in lighter 
moments, sometimes with such lugubrious results, are proofs of 
a real educational activity which not even lovers of good Latin 
will decry. 
It is from the days of the second Henry that the University 
of Oxford probably must date. But the line of Oxford teachers 
begins when his grandfather was building his Palace at Beaumont, 
and when the echoes of Abélard’s eloquence were still ringing 
in men’s ears. There have come down to us five letters from a 
teacher and theologian named Theobald of Etampes, who describes 
himself in some as a Doctor or Master of Caen, and in others as 
a Master of Oxford. One of the letters, from ‘‘ Theobaldus 
Stampensis, Doctor Cadumensis,” is addressed almost certainly — 
to Queen Margaret of Scotland, who died in-1093. Another, 
from Theobaldus, now “ Magister Oxenefordie,” is addressed to 
Faritius, Abbot of Abingdon, who ruled that great Monastery 
from r10r to 1117; and a third, with the same description of 
the writer, is addressed to Roscellinus. The change of designation 
implies that Theobald, who was teaching in the well-known 
school of Caen before the close of the eleventh century, was 
teaching at Oxford in the early years of the twelfth: and a 
short treatise written after 1119 by the same Theobald, now 
“Magister Oxinefordie,” is preserved among the Bodleian 
manuscripts to-day. Theobald, though a sound theologian, was 
no friend of the monks. He was certain of the damnation of 
unbaptised infants. But he was equally certain that a Monastery 
was ‘‘a place and prison of the damned.” The reply which 
his attack provoked is also in existence. It is important because 
it credits him with teaching, evidently in Oxford, “sixty or a 
hundred clerks more or less.” 2 It may be that Theobald’s 
1 Only that the spelling is ‘‘ Oxnefordie ” here. 
2See the Rescriptum cujusdam pro monachis (MS. Bodley 561, £. 62, 
immediately following Theobald’s tract on fol. 61). For his letters 
see D’Achery (Spicilegium, III, 445-9) and Migne (tom. 163, pp. 
759-70). Prof. Holland published the extracts in full in his article on 
The University of Oxford in the Twelfth Century (Collectanea, O.H.S., I, 
151-9). Dean Rashdall was the first English writer to point out the 
importance of these letters (Universities, II, 333-5 and notes). But 
Twyne knew of the Rescriptum, and inferred from it that Theobald was 
Head of some Oxford Hall or College (Antig. Acad. Oxon. Apologia, 224-5 
and.381). And Peshall mentions ‘‘ Mr. Theobald Stamp, a celebrated 
tutor” (Hist. of Univ. of Oxford from the Death of William the Conqueror, 1). 
Wood speaks of Theobald as a Master of Oxford under the year 1129 
(Annals, I, 140 and 142), and adopts Twyne’s suggestion.   
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  THE ORIGINS OF OXFORD 21 
teaching was promoted by the Secular Canons of St. Frideswide’s, 
and that he was to some extent the champion of their views. 
It may be that his presence in Oxford was not unconnected ~ 
with the fact that Robert Bloet, Bishop of Lincoln from 1094 
to 1123, to whom one of his letters is addressed, was like him- 
self no lover of the monastic life, but enough of a man of the 
world to kill himself by hunting with Henry I. If so, a 
very early link would be established between the Bishop 
of Lincoln and the Oxford Schools. But whatever influence 
drew Theobald to Oxford, no one can deny his claim to 
rank as the first of her recorded teachers eight hundred years 
ago. 
: A few years later, in 1133, a more famous theologian, Robert 
Pullus or Pullen, is stated in the annals of Oseney Abbey to have 
begun to lecture on the Scriptures at Oxford. A subsequent 
chronicle, embroidering perhaps on this foundation, adds that 
he came from Exeter and lectured in Oxford for five years. 
There is no doubt that Robert Pullen was a great divine, whose 
writings were an authority for churchmen, and there is no doubt 
that he lectured later on in Paris, where John of Salisbury sat 
under him as a student. He became, apparently, Archdeacon of 
Rochester. He became also, it seems, a Cardinal and Chancellor 
of the Apostolic See. The details of his life are still uncertain, 
but there is no strong ground for rejecting the tradition which 
makes him a teacher in the Oxford Schools.1 Another Robert, 
from Cricklade, who became Prior of St. Frideswide’s in 1141, 
and who composed and dedicated to Henry II an abridgment of 
Pliny’s Natural History, must have been well known to the clerks 
of Oxford, whether he studied in their Schools or not. And 
while Prior Robert was ruling at St. Frideswide’s, Master Vacarius, 
the great Lombard jurist, was in England, and probably in 
Oxford, teaching Roman Law.. Vacarius was brought over by 
Archbishop Theobald, who exerted himself to encourage the 
study of Civil and Canon Law. Gervase of Canterbury, who 
lived in the famous lawyer’s lifetime, tells us that he taught in 
1 The facts and dates given by different authorities for the career of 
Robert Pullen, who is also called Pulein, Pullein, Pullanus and Pulleyn, 
are not altogether easy to reconcile with each other. See the Oseney and 
Waverley Annals (Annales Monastici, ed. Luard, Rolls Series, IV, 19-20, 
and II, 231) ; John of Hexham, in the same series (Symeonis Mon. Op., 
ed. Arnold, Il, 319); MS. Bodley 712 (f. 275a); John of Salisbury 
(Metalogicus, Lib. II, c. 10) ; Stubbs (Lectures, 151-3) ; Holland (Collect. 
II, 159-60); Lyte (Univ. of Oxf., 10); and Rashdall (II, 335). By a 
slight error in Dean Rashdall’s note the date is given as 1233, and the 
word magistey before Robertus, which appears in the Bodley MS., is 
omitted. Wood suggests that Robert Pullen may have taught Aristotle 
at Oxford (Ann, I, 280).

CHAPTER II 
THE RISE OF THE MEDIEVAL UNIVERSITY 
HE Universities of Europe stand beside the Empire 
and the Papacy among the most illustrious institutions 
which the genius of the Middle Ages shaped. They 
became powerful and privileged communities. They built up 
a great tradition. They made themselves the mouthpiece of 
medieval thought. But originally they were only guilds of 
teachers or of students, drawn together by the instinct of associa- 
tion which played so large a part in a disordered age. These 
guilds or corporations sprang to life in places where celebrated 
Schools existed, and where one at least of the higher Faculties 
was found. The General Schools of Paris and Bologna, famed 
from the first for Theology and Law, furnished an example for 
the Universities which followed. The Masters’ Guild of Paris 
developed into a University of Masters, setting a precedent which 
Oxford was the earliest to adopt. The Students’ Guilds of 
Bologna, where the students exercised unique authority, supplied 
a model for the Student Universities elsewhere. And, widely as 
later Universities may have differed from either, it is yet from 
one or other of these two typical foundations that their successors 
to this day derive some of the most characteristic features they 
possess. 
As the thirteenth century proceeded, Popes and Emperors 
stepped in, to found new Schools of General Study, for which 
something like equality with the first Universities was claimed. 
Masters from these new Schools maintained their right to teach 
in any other, without being examined or qualifying afresh, and 
Bulls from the Heads of Christendom admitted the plea. But 
the most ancient Universities were naturally unwilling to allow 
that the jus ubique docendi placed all Masters on the same footing 
as their own. Paris required a a fresh test even from the Doctors 
of Oxford. Oxford, in spite of Papal Bulls, imposed her own 
terms upon Doctors from Paris. All Universities alike, however, 
were glad to secure the protection of the Papacy, and to fortify 
their rights with Papal sanctions. To the Popes Paris owed the 
first recognition of her corporate existence, the support which 
established her privileges and independence. To a Papal Legate 
and the power behind him Oxford owes her earliest Charter, and 
25 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
26 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
the beginning of those imperious immunities which were to make 
a society of teachers almost supreme within the city walls. 
The Masters’ Guild which grew up at Oxford before the end 
of the twelfth century brought most of its customs probably 
from Paris. But it may have been some time in taking a definite 
shape. A degree was originally nothing but a license to teach. 
All qualified persons were entitled to the license and were expected 
to undertake the duty. There was at first little or no distinction 
between the styles of Master, Doctor and Professor,1 while a 
Bachelor, though allowed to lecture after spending some years in 
study, was still regarded as a young man serving his apprentice- © 
ship in the world of letters. The earliest teachers of the Middle 
Ages naturally looked to the Church for a sanction. It was only 
in the Monasteries and Cathedral churches that education then 
survived. If the monks and-canons were not qualified to teach, 
some scholar was called in and employed for the purpose. But 
the Master or Head of the Schools became in most cases a mem- 
ber of the Cathedral body. In Northern Europe the Cathedral 
Chancellor, who looked after its library, its documents and 
learning, often undertook to supervise its teaching too. The 
Chancellor might lecture on theology himself. But other subjects 
were generally taught by a Master, and, as the desire for education 
spread, Masters ready to teach them multiplied in number. When 
a student had studied sufficiently under some acknowledged 
teacher, he might ask for a license to teach others and take his 
place in the society of Masters. For his license he would apply 
to the Head of the Schools ; the Church claimed and established 
her right to give it.2 For admittance to the Masters’ guild he 
must secure his colleagues’ help and must actually start upon 
his duties. Gradually round his initiation or Inception a number 
of curious ceremonies gathered, some perhaps inherited from 
dim traditions of Athens or of Rome, some borrowed from the 
guilds of merchants ® or from the loftier symbolism which marked 
the Knight’s initiation into the brotherhood of arms, some only 
the accompaniment, eked out with medieval formality or humour, 
of admission to any close association by which privilege was 
conferred. Thescholar received the Master’s book. The Master’s 
1 It was a later practice to use the title of Doctor specially for teachers 
of Law, a later still to reserve it, as at Oxford, for the superior Faculties, 
Law, Medicine and Theology, alone. The Regents were the teachers : 
vegere and legere meant to teach. 
2 But the early guilds of Masters sometimes claimed the right to license 
their own members. For this summary I am of course indebted largely 
to earlier writers, but chiefly to Dean Rashdall. 
8 See Gross (The Gild Merchant, 29-34). At Winchester they ‘‘ drank 
the Gild Merchant.” At Guildford new members were expected to provide 
a bull for baiting.

THE RISE OF THE MEDIZVAL UNIVERSITY. 27 
ring was placed on his finger. The Master’s cap was set on his 
head. And then, ascending the Master’s chair, and receiving his 
old teacher’s kiss and benediction, he proceeded to show his 
quality in his inaugural address. But in return for his adoption 
he had to pay his footing, to entertain his new colleagues as 
liberally as his fortunes would allow, and to find such contributions 
of gowns or gloves or money as custom sanctioned and good 
fellowship required. 
But it took many generations of students to build up these 
elaborate ceremonies, and it is not easy to say who granted 
licenses for teaching to the earliest Masters of the University of 
Oxford. The authority of the Chancellor of the Cathedral 
Church of Paris over the Schools of the famous island in the 
Seine may be traced back to a very early date, and so vigorous 
was that authority that, had it not been for the Pope’s interven- 
tion, the Chancellor might have brought the rising University 
into complete subjection to himself. But in Henry II’s day there 
was no Cathedral Church or Chancellor in Oxford. The Bishop 
of the vast diocese was at Lincoln far away ; and it chanced that 
in the latter part of the twelfth century there was for several 
years together no acting Bishop at all.2_ Analogy suggests that 
the earliest Oxford teachers would look to the Bishop’s repre- 
sentative or to one of the local religious Houses for any sanction 
they required. Teaching so often meant speculation in theology 
that the Church knew the value of controlling teachers. But, 
while the Bishop was an absentee, the Oxford Monasteries had no 
special educational repute. And it is quite possible that from the 
first the Oxford teachers enjoyed an unusual degree of indepen- 
dence. The Chancellor of the University is first mentioned in 
the well-known Legatine Ordinance of 1214, which is still preserved 
in the Tower of the Archives. The wording there suggests that 
1 For the ancient ceremonies connected with Inception, see Dean 
Rashdall’s Universities (especially I, 229-32). Evelyn speaks of the 
ceremonies, ‘‘creation of Doctors by y* cap, ring, kisse, ete:,” as‘‘ yet not 
wholy abolish’d”’ (Diary for July 10, 1654). 
2 E.g. at various times between 1168 and 1209 (Rashdall, II, 354, n., 
and 758). Under these special circumstances it is conceivable that some 
of the early Masters appointed at Oxford were not formally licensed at all. 
* The earlier document in the University Archives, dated 1201 and 
referring to the Chancellor of the University of Oxford, which Twyne 
upheld against Sir Robert Cotton, and which Wood and Du Boulay and 
later writers accepted, is now admitted to be a forgery, prepared later in 
the interests of St. Frideswide’s. Since these pages were written Mr. 
H. E. Salter has printed it, with other valuable documents, in the first 
volume of his Medieval Archives of the University (1-2). To this volume, 
with its clear and reliable references to the originals, it will now be more 
convenient for readers to refer. Of the Legatine Ordinance there are two 
versions in the Archives, one of June 20 and one of June 25, 1214, varying

28 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
the title was familiar, and was perhaps already applied in loose 
parlance to the Head of the Schools. But, on the other hand, 
the Chancellor is referred to as an official whom the Bishop shall 
appoint, and it is possible that he was not actually appointed till 
some years later. When appointed, he was the Bishop’s officer, 
an ecclesiastic who owed to the prelate behind him any jurisdiction 
he possessed. But he may from the beginning have been chosen 
from among the Masters. At.an early date he became their 
nominee. As his dependence on-the University developed, his 
dependence on the Bishop declined or disappeared. He became 
the representative of University pretensions, even of University 
usurpations, and the judicial powers which he derived from the 
Bishop he successfully passed on to the University itself. 
Before the regular appointment of a Chancellor, however, 
there was probably some Head of the Schools in existence at 
Oxford. In the Legatine Ordinance of 1214 ‘‘ the Archdeacon 
of the place”’ is conspicuously mentioned, and the Archdeacon 
may for a time have granted the license for teaching. At Bologna 
the Archdeacon acquired in the thirteenth century powers very 
similar to those of the Chancellor at Paris. Or it is possible that 
the early Oxford Masters granted the licenses and conducted the 
Inceptions for themselves.2 Or again it is possible that they 
slightly in their terms. Dean Rashdall (II, 351, notes) quotes from the 
former (Pyx P. XII, 1)—my reading of it differs on one or two trifling 
points from his. Mr. Anstey printed the Ordinance in a slightly different 
form from the Chancellor’s and Senior Proctor’s Books (Munimenta 
Academica, 1-4). But Mr, Salter has collated the two versions and printed 
the later one (Pyx P. XII, 3) in his Medieval Archives (I, pp. 2-4; thereisa 
marginal error, July 25 instead of June 25, on p. 2). Three sentences in 
the Ordinance mention the Chancellor—‘‘ quem episcopus Lincolniensis 
ibidem scolaribus preficiet.” In a draft Charter of the same year, to be 
issued by the commune of Oxford, we find the words “‘ coram archidiacono 
loci et cancellario scolarum Oxon’” (Ib.9). Three Bulls of Pope Honorius, 
of March and April 1221, couple the Chancellor with the Archdeacon of 
Worcester and the Dean of Oxford (Ib. roand 15). It is difficult to judge 
how much credit to attach to a note which Twyne quotes (MS. XXIII, 
67) in regard to another Bull of the same year—and which Dr. Rashdall 
accepts—to the effect that there was then no Chancellor in existence. 
Other references to the Oxford Chancellor in documents of 1225, 1230, 
and 1233 (as set out) are given by Dr. Rashdall (II, 355, n., and 754-6).

early Chancellorship at Montpellier and the early Chancellorship at 
Oxford. 
2? The earliest Masters at Bologna did so, but it was contrary to custom 
North of the Alps. But as late as 1246 the well-known Bull addressed to 
Grosseteste, directing that no Master should teach unless examined and 
approved by the Bishop or his representative ‘“ secundum morem Parisi- 
ensem,” suggests that the regular ecclesiastical license was sometimes 
dispensed with still. Dr. Rashdall seems to accept (II, 354, n.) Wood’s 
reference of this passage (Annals, I, 236) to the Register of Bishop Hugh

chose a representative to preside over the Schools and to license 
the teachers. In rarr, if Anthony Wood’s story may be trusted, 
a Papal Bull was addressed to the Prior of Oseney, the Dean of 
Oxford and ‘‘ Master Alardus Rector of the Schools.” 1 Even 
Robert Grosseteste, while a famous lecturer at Oxford, was not 
called Chancellor, but only ‘‘ Master of the Schools.”? The 
Parisian Masters who settled at Oxford may have taken advantage 
of their freedom to license their own colleagues and to elect their 
own ruler. And in course of time thisruler, securing the sanction 
of the Bishop and the name and standing of the Paris Chancellor, 
in a city very different from Paris where there was no Cathedral, 
no Bishop and no overshadowing Court, won for the University, 
whose authority he embodied, a unique position of privilege and 
power. 
But if at the beginning of the thirteenth century the organisa- 
tion of the University was still undeveloped, its rights not yet 
defined by charter, its customs not yet stereotyped in Statutes, it 
already enjoyed a full and vigorous life. Hundreds of students 
thronged the narrow lanes*—little fellows still learning Latin in 
the grammar schools, older boys of fifteen or sixteen already 
started on their University careers, youths in the first flush of 
manhood, eager for mysteries to solve, for worlds to conquer, 
Wells of Lincoln, But Bishop Wells died in 1235, and his Register is 
lost, though his Rotu/i have been published. Twyne took the reference 
from a later Register, and the mistake, which Wood copies, was originally 
his. The Bull is printed in M. Berger’s Vatican documents (Registres 
@ Innocent IV, 1, 277) and in the Calendar of Papal Letters (I, 225). Parisian 
Masters, during their secession to Angers in 1229, admitted new Masters, 
and once later they elected an official of their own to give the license 
(Rashdall, I, 222-3, 337 and 394). Denifle and Chatelain give Papal 
Ordinances between 1170 and 1180 forbidding the sale of licenses to teach 
(Chart. Univ. Paris, I, 4 and 10). See also Crévier (Hist. de Univ. de 
Paris, I, 256). 
1 Fasti (6). It is possible but unlikely that ‘“‘ Rector Scholarum ” here 
means only a Regent Master. A Magister Alardus, Sub-Dean of Wells, 
granted a quit-claim of land in St. Mildred’s parish, Oxford, about the 
year 1215 (Cartulary of St. Frideswide, I, 438). 
2So Bishop Sutton alleged in 1294. The phrase in the Register is 
““ Magister Scolarum”’ (Lincoln Reg., Sutton, f. 117): the Sub-Dean of 
Lincoln kindly verified it for me. Twyne (MS. XII, 7) reproduces it as 
“Magister Scholarium.”’ 
3 Medieval writers reckon them by thousands, but their statements 
must be largely discounted, and the small population of medizval England 
borne in mind. Matthew Paris gives 3,000 in 1209 (Hist. Angl., ed. 
Madden, II, 120, and Chron. Maj., ed. Luard, II, 525-6). But half that 
number would be more likely. The larger estimates included all clerks in 
the University precincts, servants, writers, stationers and dependents of 
all kinds, and are even then probably over-stated. There is little to 
suggest that many boys came to the grammar schools of Oxford except 
from the immediate neighbourhood. (See later, p. 139.)

and ripe for any mischief that hot blood could suggest.1_ Poverty 
and hardship were not unknown among them. Some perhaps 
went hungry, and some were meanly lodged. Cold and darkness, 
when the winter days descended, must have been among the 
worst of their troubles. But most of them probably had enough 
to live on, and many of them were prosperous and well-to-do. 
Pictures of student life in Paris have come down to us in two 
satirical poems of the time of Richard I. One of them is by an 
English writer, and both to a certain extent apply to contemporary 
conditions at Oxford.2. The Englishman, speaking of his country- 
men in Paris, notices their good looks and good manners, their 
open-handedness, their generous receptivity to drink. The 
Frenchman, writing in a more critical vein, and perhaps with 
something more of a poet’s license, dwells on the poverty and 
labour of the scholars, their bad lodging, their spare diet and their 
weary toil, the idleness of the richer students, the hardness of 
life for the rest. Vices they had, no doubt, and stern denuncia- 
tions of the vice of Paris are common enough in the Middle Ages. 
But the love of learning and the love of fighting were as con- 
spicuous as any other characteristics, and at Oxford at any rate 
the picture need not be too darkly drawn. Men of rank found 
it worth their while to join the University. Church and King 
befriended the students. Henry III sent his half-brother to 
Oxford, and presented him with English benefices for his mainten- 
ance, with Royal bucks for his larder and Royal charcoal for his 
fires. Lateron, when King Henry threatened to hang the Oxford 
clerks in arms against him at Northampton, he was warned that 
there were sons of his Magnates among them.* The spirit of rebellion 
and the love of turbulence were never far away. Oxford scholars 
drank and begged. Oxford brawlers justified the distich 
1 At Paris 20 was the minimum age for the Mastership, and a Deter- 
mining Bachelor had to be at least 14 (Rashdall, II, 604). There may have 
been Oxford freshmen of 12 or 13, and boys at grammar schools still 
younger. The carrier or fetcher of scholars mentioned in University 
documents (Munimenta Academica, 346) proves little, but there is no doubt 
that some undergraduates were very young. Mr. Salter has noted the 
case of a clerk of 16 dying in 1300 from the effects of a ‘‘ rag” at ‘‘ Baylol 
Hall.” In 1374 a guardian states that he has paid for his ward’s board 
at Oxford for thirteen years apparently, from the age of 8 to the age of 21 
(Riley’s Memorials of London, 379). On the other hand, some students 
were much older.

with the poorest mendicant.”

THE RISE OF THE MEDIAZ2VAL UNIVERSITY 31 
“‘When Oxford draws knife 
England’s soon at strife.” 
But there must have been many early Oxford scholars who lived 
peaceable, hard-working lives, and the story of Edmund Rich 
reminds us that from the first they had their dreamers and 
ascetics too. John of Salisbury, writing to Becket from Paris 
in 1164, had nothing to say of hardship or turbulence or sin. 
He dwelt with delight on “ the abundance of food, the joyousness 
of the people, the reverence of the clergy, the majesty and glory 
of the Church.’’1 Plenty and joyousness were probably not 
wanting even among English students of the days of King 
John?; and in the winter of 1208-9 an incident occurred at 
Oxford with which the chartered history of the University 
begins. 
At Maiden Hall, on a spot probably now within the bounds 
of New College, an obscure student killed a woman and fied.* 
The Mayor and townsmen, failing to find the offender, arrested 
two or three innocent clerks who shared his lodgings, and with 
the King’s ready permission hanged them outside the walls. 
John, then engaged in a bitter quarrel with the Church, was in 
no mood to respect the privileges of clerks. The startled students 
saw their lives endangered and their clerical immunities trampled 
under foot. The Schools were abandoned.* Masters and scholars 
took refuge at Reading, in Paris, at Maidstone, at Canterbury, 
at Cambridge. It is not the least of the glories of Oxford that by 
this chance her sons may claim a share in the foundation of another 
University as lovely and illustrious as their own.’ But the Church 
1 Quoted by Denifle and Chatelain (Chart. Univ. Paris, I, 17). 
2 There is little reason to think that Mr. Green’s phrases about rags 
and poverty and a “‘ mob of half-starved boys ”’ (Studies in Oxford History, 
Chap. I, 19) applied to any large proportion of medizval students at 
Oxford. 
3“ Casu,” says one chronicler, “‘ turpiter,’”” another. There was more 
than one Maiden Hall in medieval Oxford. Some accounts say three 
clerks were hanged, some only two. Matthew Paris and Roger of Wend- 
over say both. The latter records the settlement at Cambridge. The 
migration apparently began in January, 1209. Many chroniclers refer 
to it, some quite briefly. See Matt. Paris (Hist. Angl., ed. Madden, I, 
120, and Chron. Maj., ed. Luard, II, 525-6 and 568-9); Roger of 
Wendover (Flores Hist., ed. Hewlett, II, 51 and 94); John of Oxnead 
(ed. Ellis, 124); Walter of Coventry (ed. Stubbs, II, 201); and the 
Chronicles of Lanercost (ed. Stevenson, 4), Peterborough (ed. Stapleton, 
6), and Melrose (ed. Stevenson, 107). 
«But some Masters “‘irreverently’’ stayed on. 
5 This migration from Oxford to Cambridge, like the twelfth-century 
migration from Paris to Oxford, played, it may be, a larger part than has 
always been admitted in converting into a Studium Generale such local 
Schools as existed at Cambridge before.
-P-A-G-E-53
  32 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
proved stronger than the angry King. Interdict and excommuni- 
cation were still weapons to be feared. John, who inherited in a 
meaner form most of the failings and some of the gifts of his race— 
it is characteristic that, where William the Conqueror swore by 
God’s splendour, John swore by God’s teeth—capitulated in due 
course to the inflexible Pope. Thrown over by the King, the 
townsmen of Oxford, after four or five years of defiance, perforce 
submitted too. In 1213 they sought out the Legate, the Bishop 
of Tusculum, in London, and accepted the penance he imposed. 
Stripped and bare-footed, scourges in their hands, and chanting 
in procession the fiftieth Psalm—‘I will reprove thee and set 
before thee the things that thou has done ”’—they visited one by 
one the Oxford churches and begged for absolution from the 
parish priests. And to the University which they had offended 
the reparation offered was signally complete. 
The Legatine Ordinance of 1214, the earliest of University 
documents and charters, secured substantial benefits for the 
injured clerks. The townsmen were bidden to forgo for ten years 
half of the rent of all hostels let to clerks,1 and to leave the rents 
agreed on unchanged for ten years more. Other rents were to 
be assessed every ten years by a board of four Masters and four 
townsmen. The town was condemned to pay fifty-two shillings 
yearly for ever for the use of poor scholars, and to feast a hundred 
poor scholars regularly upon St. Nicholas’ day. The obligation 
was immediately taken over by the monks of Eynsham,? but the 
fine survived when the monks disappeared, and a substitute for 
it is still, seven centuries later, paid to the University each year 
by the Crown.? The townsmen swore to provide the students 
with food and necessaries at reasonable rates. They agreed, 
in the event of any clerk being arrested by them in future, to 
1“ Hospitiorum omnium locandorum clericis in eadem uilla.” The 
rents had been assessed before the dispersion ‘‘ communi consilio clericorum 
et burgensium’”’ (Med. Arch. Univ. I, 2-3). .Twyne notes (MS. XVII, 
281) that some clerks, who rented houses belonging to Monasteries, tried 
to take advantage of the clause to reduce their rents, which was not at 
all what the Legate intended. In 1256 Henry III ordered rents to be 
reassessed every five years (Med. Arch. 1, 21, and Cal. Pat. Rolls, 1256, 
p. 462), and this order was repeated in 1269 (Med. Arch. 1, 28-9). 
3 The earlier version of the deed in the Archives (P. XII, 1) has words 
providing that some one might undertake this duty for the town. But 
the later version of June 25 (P. XII, 3) omits them. (See Med. Arch. I, 
2-3.)

the Curators of the University Chest still receive each year from the 
Paymaster-General £3 1s. 6d.—Income Tax is no longer deducted—for

surrender him on the demand of the Bishop or his deputy, and 
to resort to no devices* to infringe the Bishop’s jurisdiction. 
The oath of fifty leading townsmen to observe these provisions 
was to be repeated every year.* The Masters, who had remained 
at Oxford and “ irreverently ’’ lectured when the rest withdrew, 
were to be punished with three years’ suspension. And all 
responsible for the original outrage were to march to the grave 
of the murdered men, uncloaked, unshod, ungirdled, with the 
rest of the townsfolk following behind, and to bear their bodies 
to hallowed ground, for burial where the Church ordained.4 
This memorable Ordinance is the first record of Oxford 
immunities and the first step in the University’s ascendency over 
the town. It shows us the Chancellorship beginning to develop. 
The Abbot of Oseney and the Prior of St. Frideswide’s, two of the 
principal ecclesiastics on the spot, may act as trustees for the 
poor scholars in the distribution of the fine. But the management 
of the affairs of the rising University is in the hands of its Masters 
and of the Bishop’s officials. It shows us the origins of the for- 
midable jurisdiction which was to be the source of the University’s 
power, the right of the Chancellor, as the Bishop’s representative, 
to exempt from secular authority all clerks under his sway, to 
deal as a churchman with clerical delinquents, to substitute 
clerical punishments, suspension, excommunication, penance, for 
the harsher but more effective weapons of the ordinary law. It 
shows the existence of a working agreement between clerks and 
townsmen for fixing the rents of houses where the students lived ; 
the ancient office of University Taxor has apparently begun. 
It shows that some order must have been issued for the withdrawal 
of the University from Oxford, which the recalcitrant Masters 
disobeyed, and that some recognised authority, perhaps the whole 
body of Masters, already existed to speak in the University’s 
mame. And it shows, in the annual fine levied for the benefit 
of poor scholars, the first traces of a University endowment.

34 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Out of these humble beginnings the system of University 
Chests arose. In 1240 Bishop Grosseteste directed that the 
University’s new revenues, the fifty-two shillings a year, with 
any additions made by the faithful, should be paid into a Chest 
at St. Frideswide’s Priory. The Chest was placed in charge of 
a brother, appointed by the Prior with the Chancellor’s assent, 
and of two discreet men whom the University elected, and it 
became the first of many charities for financing needy students. 
The Jews of the town were ready enough to lend money toscholars 
at exorbitant rates: Royal orders were needed to restrict the 
interest to forty-three per cent. But the University Chest issued 
loans without interest. It only required the deposit of some 
pledge—a cup, a garment, a precious manuscript, an illuminated 
missal—to be sold at the end of a year if repayment failed. There 
are yet to be found in English libraries ancient manuscripts so 
pawned. One of them, which contains the name of Wycliffe, 
is among the treasures of the British Museum. In early days the 
right of borrowing from the Chest was restricted to scholars whose 
income from benefices did not exceed ten marks. The loans were 
limited to one mark, thirteen shillings and four pence, for a 
Master, to eight shillings for a Bachelor, and to five shillings for 
a Sophister ; and as time passed these regulations were varied, 
and others laid down to prevent abuse. The Chest at St. 
Frideswide’s, the University’s only bank, was evidently needed. 
Its foundation was soon followed by the establishment of others. 
After 1249 a second Chest was required to store the bequest of 
William of Durham. In 1293 a great lady founded a third. 
Within a hundred years the University could boast of many such 
endowments, which rendered borrowers invaluable service, and 
well deserved to be remembered in their prayers. 
Thus even before the death of King John the earliest rights 
of the University had been won. The Congregation of Masters 
must sometimes have met. Executive officers of the Masters’ 
Guild, Rectors or Proctors, may already have existed? The 
1 Ela, Countess of Warwick. Several others were founded during the 
next thirty years, and others again later. After early days they were 
kept at St. Mary’s and the rules were varied. The 52s. paid by Eynsham 
was treated as income, and divided among needy Regent Masters. For 
the annual feast of 100 poor scholars 16s. was paid by Eynsham also. 
And a further sum of 26s. 8d. a year was received, under an arrangement 
of Grosseteste’s, from Oseney Abbey. (See Med. Arch. Il, 276-7, Mun. 
Acad. passim., and later, Chap. VIII.) 
2 Adam Marsh speaks of two Rectors of the Artists (Monumenta 
Franciscana, 1, 347). See also Rashdall (II, 370). The term Rector 
occasionally reappears. Among the Magdalen MSS. is a Bull addressed 
by Innocent VIII in 1484, ‘‘ Rectori et Universitati studii Oxonien ”’ 
(Eighth Report, Historical MSS. Commission, 266)—perhaps only a notary’s 
error,
-P-A-G-E-56
  THE RISE OF THE MEDIZVAL UNIVERSITY 35 
Chancellorship was a recognised office. The University Taxors 
were at work. But it is not till the reign of John’s successor, the 
‘simple and pacific”? King,1 whose weakness led to so much 
mischief, that the University organisation took a definite shape. 
Even in the days of Bishop Grosseteste the Chancellor was only 
one of his officials, whose authority depended entirely on his 
chief. The Bishop intervened freely in University administration, 
and disapproved of the Chancellor’s using the University’s seal.? 
But no conflict between Bishop and University had arisen yet. 
We do not know how far at this early date the Chancellor presided 
over business. But as time goes on his prominence increases and 
his name recurs. He might attend Congregation as a Doctor, and 
if he attended it would probably become the custom to put him 
in the chair. His consent may not have been needed for the 
withdrawal of a license or the suspension of a teacher ; but his 
powers of excommunication and imprisonment were of obvious 
value in enforcing the University’s decrees. The Proctors, who 
are first mentioned in 1248, may have been from the beginning 
the University’s executive. But the Chancellor was becoming 
more and more identified with the interests of the students. 
Under Henry III the importance of the University developed 
fast. In 1228 and the years that followed the jealousy between 
Town and Gown blazed out afresh. The clerks and so-called 
clerks perhaps abused their privileges. The laymen perhaps 
failed to keep the spirit of the promises which they had made. 
Dangerous quarrels followed. Interdict and fine were resorted 
to again. The townsmen were compelled to send the offenders ® 
to Rome, and to accept the arbitration of four Masters in all 
future controversies with the triumphant clerks. The Friars 
came, to stimulate the fervour of the Church and swell its numbers. 
The troubles which in 1229 dispersed the great University of 
Paris, brought a new colony of Masters and students to the now 
famous schools by the Thames. Questions arose over food 
prices. The townsmen tried to raise their rents for lodgings, and 
the King was called in to settle the dispute. The pride of Oxford 
scholars was growing, and in 1238 they found themselves in

Cambridge also. Du Boulay (Hist. Univ. Paris, III, 132) thinks Henry’s 
invitation to them clandestine and unfriendly. It offered to assign 
them for residence any English cities or towns they liked (Med. Arch. I, 
17-18).

36 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
conflict even with the ecclesiastical superiors to whose powerful 
protection their immunities were due. 
It chanced that the Papal Legate Otho visited Oseney Abbey 
in that year, and the scholars, who had sent him a present before 
dinner-time one April day, called after dinner to pay their respects, 
and perhaps to ask for favours in return. ‘ A certain transalpine 
Janitor,’ however, “raising his voice in the Roman manner,”? 
flatly refused them admission, and a free fight followed with the 
Legate’s train. During the fray the master of the Legate’s cooks, 
who happened also to be his Eminence’s brother, flung a pot of 
boiling water over an Irish chaplain begging at the kitchen door. 
A Welsh clerk drew a bow and shot the master-cook. The 
scholars broke into the Abbey. The Legate was denounced with 
all the wealth of their vocabulary as a usurer, a simonist, a stealer 
of the nation’s goods. Startled by charges which would leave 
a modern sinner undismayed, the Cardinal seized his canonicals 
and fled into the tower. By night he escaped across the river, 
and appearing at Abingdon claimed the protection of the King. 
Henry promptly took steps to punish the scholars.. Some thirty 
of the leaders were arrested and sent like felons to Wallingford 
and London. The gates of Oxford were closely watched. 
Lectures were suspended. Excommunication and interdict were 
solemnly proclaimed. And it needed all the fearless energy of 
Bishop Grosseteste, and his sturdy plea for common-sense and 
justice, to appease the angry Cardinal and to secure pardon for 
either University or town. Even then the offenders had to take 
part ina penitential procession through the streets of London, and 
to pay for the repose of the master-cook’s soul. Many days 
elapsed before the fugitive scholars, who had taken refuge at 
Northampton and Salisbury,? and had founded there schools 
which lingered on for several years, returned to Oxford and 
resumed their studies in peace. 
The Legate’s servants, as the English Bishops bluntly told 
him, were largely to blame for the outbreak at Oseney. But the 
disorders of Oxford students in the thirteenth century had not 
always, it is to be feared, so much excuse. Their love of mischief * 
was proverbial. Their brawls and riots, their high spirits and 
low conduct, often broke the bounds of decency and law. 
1 Matt. Paris (Chron. Maj. III, 482). The story has been often told, 
and the Oseney Annals (Ann. Monast., IV, 84-6) ought to give the most 
reliable account. But Matthew Paris has the liveliest details. There are 
several references to the incident in the Close Rolls and Patent Rolls for 1238. 
®Trivet (Annales, ed. Hog, 224). 
*E.g. in 1259, when a body of clerks, with the Vicar of St. Giles’ 
among them, rescued from prison a man condemned to death for murdering 
his wife (Lyte, 49). Matt. Paris (Chron. Maj. V, 743-4) connects this 
incident, rather vaguely, with a disturbance at Cambridge.
-P-A-G-E-58
THE RISE OF THE MEDIZVAL UNIVERSITY 37 
Discipline was clearly the first thing to insist on, and the most 
ancient University Statutes were chiefly occupied with the 
preservation of the peace.1 They proclaimed punishment and 
excommunication for all offenders. Seditious pacts and factions 
were prohibited. To bear arms for purposes of doing evil, to 
enter laymen’s houses with mischievous intent, to indulge in 
games which led to quarrels, were forbidden as firmly as night- 
prowling, poaching, loitering after curfew, or the temptations of 
concubines and women of ill fame. Penalties were denounced 
against violence to townsmen, against fraud in the letting of 
houses, against conspiracies in the election of University officials. 
The greater excommunication threatened clerks who went about 
at festivals, and danced in streets and churches masked or 
garlanded with flowers. But the most important attempts to 
enforce discipline were the ancient rules, adopted probably before 
1231,” requiring every scholar, under pain of excommunication, 
to have his own Regent Master on whose roll his name was placed, 
and to attend at least one ordinary lecture of his Master’s every 
day. Only students frequenting the Schools were to enjoy the 
University’s protection, men known to be scholars and of good 
repute. False scholars and suspicious characters were to be 
discovered to the Chancellor, and he might banish them from 
Oxford, or have them cast into prison if they stayed. 
Statutes of this kind were proclamations, designed primarily 
for the maintenance of order. They were published, it seems, 
yearly in the Schools and recited at Christmas in the churches. 
They may also have been posted in conspicuous places in the 
town. As time went on, the King helped to strengthen the 
jurisdiction of the Chancellor,? while that officer for his part did 
his best to render effective the spiritual law. When he needed 
weapons stronger than excommunication, he might use the town 
1 The earliest collection of Statutes has only lately been discovered by 
Mr. Madan and Mr. Gibson on two leaves of a thirteenth-century MS. in 
the Bodleian (Bodl. MS. e Mus. 96), which contains various treatises on 
grammar. I am here again indebted, as so often, to Mr. Gibson’s notes. 
This collection, dating apparently from about 1275, has been printed 
in the Bodleian Quarterly Record (III, 116-18). I refer to other early 
Statutes also here. 
2 In the year 1231 the King, in letters to the Sheriffs of Cambridge and 
Oxford, forbade any clerks to remain in those towns who were not under 
the ‘‘ discipline or tuition of some master of the schools ”’ (Cal. Close Rolls, 
586-7). But the Royal authority may have been invoked to confirm some 
existing Statute or custom. 
*In March 1236 Henry III promised that, if the University were 
patient and obedient, he would come with the Primate and provide for 
its tranquillity. Later in the same year apparently he ordered the 
Constable at Oxford to put the King’s prison at the Chancellor’s disposal 
(Cal. Cl. Rolls, 343 and 514).

or Castle prison. For scholars and other slight offenders of the 
better class a separate prison was presently found in the chamber 
over Bocardo Gate.1 But even then, if a clerk declined the 
Bedel’s invitation to surrender, it seems. doubtful whether any 
compulsion except the threat of banishment from Oxford was 
applied. The Church was apt to be indulgent to her children. 
The secular arm, Sheriff, Mayor or Bailiff, was not always prompt 
to enforce ecclesiastical judgments. Serious crimes requiring 
deposition or degradation the King reserved for the Bishop or 
his deputy, and refused in spite of the scholars’ grumblings to 
allow the Chancellor to try.2. The power of degrading clerks, it 
seems, the Chancellor never possessed. Threats to close the 
Schools were made and acted on when the University disapproved 
of the authorities’ decisions, and in 1240 there was another 
migration to Cambridge on the part of discontented students.’ 
Universities with no buildings and hardly any property could 
easily be moved, and a threat to desert Oxford altogether was a 
weapon which the townsmen could be made to feel. 
Meanwhile the Chancellor’s jurisdiction steadily grew. In 
1244 a memorable quarrel with the Jews ended in a very important 
increase of his authority, in his securing the right to deal with all 
cases of debts and contracts in which students were involved.* 
In 1248, when a well-known Scottish scholar died from injuries 
inflicted by an Oxford mob, the Masters stopped all lectures till 
retribution had been made. Grosseteste excommunicated the 
offenders. The Masters sent their Proctors to Woodstock to 
interview the King, and a Royal charter affirmed the privileges 
of the scholars. Wrongs done to them in future were to be 
inquired into by juries on which persons from the neighbourhood 
1See Rashdall (II, 392-3). Mr. Boase reminds us that Bocardo was 
the name of a form of syllogism (Oxford, 44,”). But was the prison named 
after the syllogism or the syllogism after the prison? Wood makes it a 
prison “‘ for scollers for little faults,”’ and boldly derives it from ‘‘ bochord ” 
the Saxon for a library—the University having in Saxon days been at 
Beaumont just outside (City, I, 255). It stood close to St. Michael’s 
Church. 
2 Mon. Francisc. (I, 115). The point arose several times in the 
thirteenth century. But the charter of 1255 gave the Chancellor power 
to demand the surrender of clerks detained in the Castle even for grave 
crimes (Lyte, 45-6). 
3 Matt. Paris (Chron. Maj. IV, 7-8). Wood (Ann. V, 231) gives it 
under 1241. 
4Sir H. Maxwell Lyte deals fully with this important Royal edict 
(41-2), which he terms ‘‘the Magna Charta of the University.” The 
jurisdiction over contracts which the Chancellor acquired was limited to 
moveables, but the rent of lodgings and the prices of horses and of food 
were important items in it. (See Cal. Pat. Rolls, 1244, pp. 424 and 442.) 
Sir H. M. Lyte draws attention to the light which the incident throws on 
the Chancellor’s still uncertain position.

THE RISE OF THE MEDIZVAL UNIVERSITY 39 
as well as townsmen were to serve. Grievous hurt received at 
the hands of townsmen was to be punished by a fine upon the 
town. Bailiffs who neglected to bring the offenders to justice 
were to be held individually responsible. Every Mayor and 
Bailiff, on assuming office, was to swear to respect University 
liberties and customs. Jewish usurers were checked in their 
charges. The Chancellor and Proctors received the right to be 
present at the assay of bread and ale.1 A similar quarrel two or 
three years later, when the town authorities imprisoned two 
clerks, led to another stoppage of lectures and a fresh demand 
that the Chancellor alone should deal with University offenders. 
And in 1255 another charter, while making better provision for 
the maintenance of order, and safeguarding the rights of the 
University in the sale of provisions, the making of bread and the 
brewing of beer, gave the Chancellor for the first time the power 
to insist on the punishment of laymen for criminal offences. 
If they injured clerks they were to be arrested and imprisoned, 
till reasonable satisfaction for the wrong had been received? 
Already in these early charters we find phrases® destined to 
play a large part in the conflicts and documents of later years. 
It was only by degrees that the University succeeded in estab- 
lishing its rights. The privileges for which it fought so stoutly 
were by no means all unwarrantable usurpations ; many of them 
were founded in the special necessities of the case. Almost alone 
among the towns of medieval England,* Oxford contained two 
self-governing communities, very nearly equal in importance, 
dwelling in the same place, using the same streets and markets, 
and constantly appealing to the Sovereign to see justice done 
between them.’ The position was rendered more difficult by 
the fact that the townsmen were nearly all producers, whose 
interest it was to keep prices up, while the members of the 
University were essentially consumers, with a natural preference 
for cheapness, and obliged to buy what they needed on the spot. 
The University officials were thus closely concerned in all questions 
relating to the quality and price of goods. Trade regulations

40 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
touched them as nearly as the rents of houses or the sanitation 
of the town, and it was a matter of no small importance to secure 
some control over the supplies of bread and beer, of provisions, 
boots and clothing and other necessaries of life. The Chancellor 
was obliged in the interests of his clients to ask for more and more 
authority to deal with bakers, brewers, vintners, and the sale of 
food. The ancient merchant guild of Oxford was well able to 
protect its freemen, and in establishing its rights against them 
the University needed the protection of the Crown.t 
Conflicts with the townsmen and exactions by the Jews were 
responsible for many of the Chancellor’s troubles and for many 
of the offences which he had to judge. But quarrels between the 
scholars themselves were a hardly less prolific source of friction. 
The division of scholars into Nations, which played so large a 
part in the University of Paris, appeared at Oxford too. It is 
possible that the four Taxors appointed to settle rents in 1214 and 
the four Masters appointed to arbitrate after the dispute of 1228, 
may indicate some early attempt to reproduce at Oxford the 
four Nations of Paris.2 But even with visitors from abroad, and 
with Irish, Welsh and Scottish students, the material for four 
Nations must have run short, and so far as we know Northerners 
and Southerners, Boreales and Australes, dwellers North or 
South of Trent, were the only Nations recognised in Oxford 
brawls. The Northerners of course included the Scots; the 
Southerners embraced the Welsh and the Irish, the latter ever 
conspicuous in the tumults of the day. It is perhaps a tribute 
to the fame of Oxford that so many of her students came to her 
from the North. For many years the feuds of the two Nations 
broke the peace of University and Town. The Chancellor and 
Masters had to forbid the celebration of national festivals in 
churches. In 1252, after a famous fray between Northerners 
and Irish, a treaty was made “‘ in full congregation ’’ in St. Mary’s 
Church, and representatives of both sides were sworn to observe 
it.3 But that did not prevent a regular battle of the Nations a 
few years later on. Again, in 1267, a solemn agreement was 
drawn up between twenty-four of each side, after exchanging the 
kiss of peace; its terms, and the Chancellor’s assent, and the 
seals of many of those who signed it, are preserved in the Univer- 
sity Archives still Northerners and Irishmen alike were to

able in the fourteenth century. But beyond writs sent in answer to com- 
plaints or petitions, privilegia, private laws, were needed, as Mr. Salter has 
pointed out, to amend the general law, and to give the University rights in 
Oxford equal to those which the burgesses already enjoyed.

appoint captains to settle their affairs, with an appeal to arbiters 
and to thé Chancellor or his deputy! only in the last resort. The 
rival parties were bound not to take up arms against each other 
under penalty of a heavy fine. And once again, in 1274, after 
fresh and serious disturbances, which had more than once called 
for the intervention of the Crown, the Nations all joined in a 
solemn concord,? and swore to support the Chancellor in putting 
down disturbers of the peace. This last agreement, made with 
great publicity, seems to have taken a long step towards achieving 
its object. It boldly extinguished the rival factions by uniting 
Northerners and Southerners in a single Nation. Henceforward 
the University was to know no parties, but only one “‘ collegium ” 
and one “corpus.” The Faculty of Arts perhaps began to vote 
asa single body. The Northern and Southern Proctors survived 
only as representatives of divisions which in theory at any rate 
had vanished. The English genius for unity and order triumphed 
in the end. But for a long while the old Adam persisted, and it 
was not till a much later generation that the feuds of the Oxford 
Nations completely disappeared.* 
The Inns and Halls where the students lodged must from a 
very early date have been conspicuous in Oxford. As time went 
on, they sprang up in all quarters, but most thickly in the centre 
of the town. The lads who lodged in them with surprising 
independence—fourteen or fifteen was not too early to begin— 
hired their own houses, formed their own societies, and elected 
one of their own number as their Head. It was only by degrees 
that this early democratic tradition was extinguished, and that 
the self-governing Halls developed into boarding-houses ruled by 
Principals whom the University authorities supervised. Many 
of the Halls were, no doubt, very small, but some had once been 
private houses occupied by well-known merchants. Some of the 
best had been built by Jews, who were among the first house- 
holders to study solidity and comfort. The Guildhall was the 
property of Moses, son of Isaac, before Henry III in 1229 gave

Med. Arch. (I, 30-3) and Mr. Salter’s valuable note, and Rashdall (II, 
369). 3 In 1313 it was thought desirable, in framing a Statute, to remind 
the University that Northern and Southern Nations no longer existed 
(Mun. Acad. 92). But the riots of the latter part of the fourteenth 
century show that the old animosities were easily revived, and the Merton 
Register (I, ff. 161-2) records a very serious one in August 1506. 
‘Inns and entries, Halls and hostels, all alike offered lodgings for 
students—many of them probably quite small. It seems unlikely that 
they numbered more than 70 at any one time. The Mitre, the Clarendon 
and the Roebuck occupy the sites of earlier Inns or Halls.

42 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
it to the town. Other Halls, like Jacob’s Hall and Lombard’s 
Hall, also descended from the Jews.1 After the great fire of 1190 
stone and slate began to take the place of wood and straw. Stone 
Halls and Tiled Halls gradually replaced the old Thatched Halls. 
Glazen Halls and Leaden Halls came into fashion later, and 
Staple Halls, Wood suggests, when staples to the doors replaced 
the older plan of latch and catch.? It is not always easy to say 
when the early Halls passed into the hands of students. But 
before the end of the thirteenth century there are several noted, 
where sooner or later clerks were housed. Vine Hall, Chimney 
Hall, Nightingale Hall were names that already existed. The 
site of Knight Hall near Logic Lane is mentioned in 1238, the 
site of Aristotle Hall still earlier. There was a Black Hall built 
before 1267, one of many Black Halls in medieval Oxford. 
Broadgates was already a familiar name. In the High Street 
Inge Hall was standing in the middle of the century, if not, as 
Wood says, in the days of King John. Bodin Hall, near Balliol, 
is referred to in 1230. Brackley Hall, in Broad Street also, was 
known, it may be, even earlier. A Maiden Hall figures in the 
troubles of 1209; and that and many of the older names were 
freely repeated as the years went on. 
But the records of the Oxford citizens who built these ancient 
houses go back further. Their.names must have been familiar 
to many generations of Oxford men. Segrims and Kepeharms 
were leading families in the twelfth century, if not before that. 
Segrims indeed are mentioned in Domesday, and Segrim By-wall 
had a house near the North Gate in 1129. Richard Segrim had 
a great house at the corner of St. Aldate’s Churchyard, now 
swallowed up in Pembroke College, and another house in Shidyerd 
Street,* the rent of which was a rose. Both these houses in the 
thirteenth century probably passed into the hands of students. 
Peter Segrim, another of the family, got into trouble in 1285, 
for fishing—one hesitates to call it poaching—in the company of 
two Abbots. Kepeharm Hall in High Street figures in a grant 
of 1249. Kepeharm Lane was in St. Aldate’s. John Kepeharm, 
the Mayor, died in 1205. Laurence Kepéharm’s name appears 
in a beautiful little document of about that date, which has been 
lately reproduced and published. Adelicia Kepeharm, the 
1Mr. J. R. Green suggested that the number of substantial houses in 
Oxford, largely due to Jews, may have helped to draw teachers and 
students to the town. 
2 Mr. Boase accepts this derivation (Oxford, 49). But there are other 
derivations, from steeple and from stable. (See later, Chap. XVI.) 
* Or Schidyard Street: there are other spellings. It was called Oriel 
Street later. But medizval street names vary. Both Schools Street and 
High Street were sometimes called St. Mary’s Street (Mun. Civ. Oxon. 
274,n.). There were other Segrim houses near St, Aldate’s Church.

THE RISE OF THE MEDIZVAL UNIVERSITY 43 
Mayor’s widow, was sought in marriage by Stephen of Oxford, 
who offered the King two hundred hens for a Royal letter to 
recommend him to the lady. But the widow, knowing her 
Sovereign better, offered a hundred marks and two palfreys for 
her freedom, and the King apparently secured the hens as well. 
The Penyverthings, another old Oxford family, left their name 
in Pennyfarthing Street, till Pembroke Street displaced it. The 
Peckwethers, also prominent in Henry ITI’s day, are immortalized 
still in a great quadrangle. Somnore Lane, close by the North 
Wall, and Cheyney Lane, nearer the Market, may have taken their 
names from early citizens!: there were Cheynes in King Stephen’s 
troubled reign. The Burewalds had “great possessions in 
Oxford,” and were commemorated in St. Michael’s Church. 
Other old names recur persistently in documents—Halegods and 
Bodins, Padys and Stockwells, Bullocks, Hardings, Owens and 
Griffins, Inges and Knights, mingled with others less euphonious 
like Nuky, Log and Rok. Copin the Jew figures as a man of 
substance. Eilric Helleknave has to live down hisname. A shop 
near the Cornmarket? passes about 1220 to the father-in-law of 
Henry Gamage. A lease of another in High Street is recorded 
in 1195. The story of one corner tenement in High Street, 
granted in the thirteenth century to Stephen the book-binder on 
a perpetual lease, and part of the great property inherited from 
St. John’s Hospital by Magdalen College, is an interesting little 
example of the continuity of English custom. Its rent was 
fixed at thirty shillings in 1253. It declined to twelve shillings 
by 1487. But it stood at that figure unaltered from the days of 
the first of the Tudors until the reign of Queen Victoria had 
begun, and for six hundred years we can follow the history of the 
place. For generation after generation the old cartularies have 
preserved for us such memorials of the city in which the University 
was to dwell.® 
The Halls and hostels used by students were gradually 
organised on a more regular footing. Their independence 
admitted limitations. The Principal, originally little more than 
a leader and not necessarily a member of the University, elected

moner’s Lane (Hurst, Oxford Topography, 141). 
2 It was not till the sixteenth century that Northgate Street became 
the Cornmarket (Salter, Names of Oxford Streets, 13). 
3 See the Cartulary of St. John’s Hospital (I, 335-8). The details given 
above have been drawn chiefly from the three volumes of this Cartulary, 
admirably edited by Mr. Salter, from the Cartulary of St. Frideswide 
(ed. Wigram), and the larger History of Pembroke College (ed. Macleane). 
See also the Cartulary of Eynsham (ed. Salter) and Wood (City, ed. Clark) 
passim. There were of course other thirteenth-century Halls in Oxford 
well authenticated besides those mentioned in the text.

44 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
by the little society to be responsible for the rent and the running 
of the house, became by custom a Bachelor or Master.1 He was 
compelled to give security before the Chancellor for the rent of 
his Hall, and was thus gradually brought under University 
control. He was held responsible for the conduct of his scholars, 
for their attendance at lectures, for their discipline and learning. 
The Chancellor even claimed the right to remove him, and to 
veto the rules, the Hall Statutes, which the students made.? 
Heads of Halls were forbidden to buy or sell their places, to 
hold more than one such post at a time, to be absent from their 
duties for more than a year. The University had already estab- 
lished its right to determine rents with the townsmen, and to 
regulate all houses where its students lodged. If the lay owner 
of a Hall failed to execute repairs, the clerical tenant could do 
them and deduct the cost from his rent. The Masters insisted 
that houses once used as Halls or Schools should never be let to 
lay tenants, so long as scholars were willing to take them. And 
Royal sanction was secured for the doctrine that the University 
had a claim on all houses previously occupied by scholars, and 
indeed on all that could be spared.*® 
The University was steadily encroaching. But the townsmen 
were at first well able to defend themselves. Oxford in the days 
of Simon de Montfort held her head high among the cities of the 
land. She claimed like liberties with London, ‘‘ the same custom 
and law.” £ Her weavers and cordwainers had established their 
rights under Henry I. There were looms, it seems, at work 
beside the Cherwell, wool-markets in Northgate Hundred and on 
Holywell Green.’ St. Frideswide’s and St. Giles’ were not the 
only ancient fairs. There were busy stalls and dealers around 
Carfax, with rules and customs to govern their trade. The 
Ordination of the Market was to follow later on.6 Henry II had 
1Mr. Anstey quotes an undated Statute forbidding Manciples and 
servants to act as Principals (Mun. Acad. 468-9). Mr. Gibson dates this 
before 1380. 
* From the days of Edward I, as a passage in Reg. A. asserts (Ib. 470 
and Rashdall, II, 466). See also Mun. Acad. (14, 93, 427). These 
student ordinances were, no doubt, based on custom, 
® See the Writ of 1303 (Med. Arch. I, 81-2) ; also Rashdall (II, 467), 
and Mun. Acad. (13-16). 
«In 1301 the King confirmed the old charter granting the burgesses 
of Oxford the same liberties as the citizens of London (Ogle, Royal Letters 
to Oxford, 16). Oxford is often spoken of as a civitas, but till the days of 
the Tudor Bishopric it seems better to call it a town. 
5 Boase (Oxford, 36). It has been suggested that before the middle 
of the fourteenth century the Oxford weavers disappeared (Lipson, Hist. 
of Woollen Industries, 11). But in the Poll Tax return of 1380-81, 23 
weavers and 13 fullers are mentioned, if Prof. Thorold Rogers’ reading be 
correct (Oxf. City Docts. 6).

  THE RISE OF THE MEDIZVAL UNIVERSITY 45 
confirmed the Merchant Guild which he found in existence, and 
which may have dated from very early days. His son had given 
the Guild a perpetual lease of the town and its profits, and the 
Guild’s members formed a community of burgesses, to farm its 
taxes and to control its trade. These burgesses were the free- 
men, free to trade in Oxford, an aristocracy, it may be, but not 
too narrow to secure general assent. About the beginning of 
the fourteenth century the Guildsmen adopted the name of 
Hanasters,? as the ancient weekly Court or Portmote had adopted 
the name of Hustengs some twenty years before. The Hustengs 
Court was attended by all householders, but its procedure, in 
actions for debt especially, could not compete in cheapness or 
speediness with that of the Chancellor’s Court. The Hanasters 
have been estimated at something like five hundred in number. 
They represented at one time probably a majority of adult towns- 
men, and certainly the wealthiest and most important people in 
the town. They provided the municipal officers, the Mayor and 
Aldermen and Bailiffs: the Aldermen were doubled in number 
by Henry III, to correspond with the four Wards formed by the 
streets which crossed at Carfax. They provided also a Town- 
clerk and Chamberlains and other officers, who received perqui- 
sites, but no regular salaries, for what must often have been 
laborious work.* : 
Under Henry III the old town walls were rebuilt solidly in 
stone. A continuous lane ran round the town inside them. 
The beauty of the North Gate, the strongest of the four because 
there was no river on that side to defend it, with its towers and 
portcullis and battlements and statues, has been dwelt on by 
Wood with an antiquary’s affection. Beyond it was a deep 
ditch, Candich, above which the buildings of Horsemonger Street 
rose. Mills were working on the many waters; the Castle Mill 
1 The fee-farm was fixed in 1199 at £63 os. 5d.—that is {40 beyond 
the sum allowed for maintaining the 13 inmates of St. Bartholomew’s 
Hospital, a duty which the burgesses took over from the King (Mun. 
Civ. Oxon. xxxvi). 
* Hanaster is connected with hansa or hanse, a guild. (See Mr. Salter’s 
Mun. Civ. Oxon.—a volume to which I am here repeatedly indebted— 
xxvii and 288.) 
* There were two sets of officials, Bailiffs and Chamberlains, collecting 
money, and when Parliament voted a subsidy another collector was 
required. The Chamberlains collected the town income, rents, fees, mill 
profits, fishery profits, etc. The Bailiffs collected the fee-farm and paid 
it into the Exchequer (Ib. xxxi sq.). 
‘ The buildings in medieval Oxford generally, I think, stood back some 
little way from the road. Horsemonger Street was the road’s name in 
the thirteenth century : Candich is found in 1379 and for at least 300 years 
after that. In 1750 Broad Street appears on a map (Salter, Historie 
Names of Oxford Streets, 21).
-P-A-G-E-67
46 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
is standing yet. Certain springs or wells were already famous ; 
Bruman’s well, called Aristotle’s later, was named from a tenant 
of Robert d’Oili. The Friars had come and were begging and 
toiling side by side with the poorest of the poor. Away to the 
South, beyond the river, lay the forest where the legendary 
student, armed only with his Aristotle, had choked and conquered 
the wild boar, the meadows where Edmund Rich in his dreaming 
boyhood had met face to face the child of God. To the East, 
outside the Gate beneath St. Peter's, the Hospital of St. John 
with its many possessions owed its new buildings to King 
Henry’s bounty, but its foundation to an earlier date. And close 
to the Hospital the Jews had their first cemetery,1 where the 
ground fell to the water-side, and where for centuries now the 
loveliest tower in Oxford has watched the happy generations 
drifting by. 
In thirteenth-century Oxford, until King Edward banished 
them, there was no denying the importance of the Jews. 
Persecuted and hated as they might be for their faith and their 
exactions, for the wealth which helped so powerfully to finance 
the Middle Ages, to build minster and castle, to develop trade, 
they were the King’s paymasters as well as his chattels, and 
secure in the tyrannous protection which he gave. Their settle- 
ments in the Great and Little Jewry, between the High Street 
and St. Frideswide’s, occupied a considerable part of the centre 
of the town. Their holdings filled the lanes behind Fish Street,” 
now St. Aldate’s, and stretched to the East over St. Edward’s 
parish. St. Frideswide’s Priory was induced—it needed perhaps 
strong inducements—to sell them a site for their Synagogue 
opposite St. Aldate’s Church. The Civil Law Schools and the 
Canon Law Schools were established in their midst. At the 
end of the twelfth century Law students clustered thickly round 
St. Aldate’s, and for a while the study of the Law threatened to 
take possession of Oxford. Next to the Guildhall, once a Jewish 
building, was a house belonging to the House of Converts which 
Henry III with pious irony set up. But the Jews, it seems, 
retorted by making converts too. The Synagogue itself after 
the expulsion of its old owners became a tavern. But on the 
ground behind it a Hall for students rose, known, from the 
1The cemetery was afterwards ‘moved across the road, says 
Mr. Boase (Oxford, 24), to the site of the present Botanic Gardens. 
2 But probably the name Fish Street appeared only in the fourteenth 
century, after the expulsion of the Jews. It lasted till 1772 or later. 
It ran then to Folly Bridge. But in the Middle Ages and long 
after, up to 1750, the Southern part, beyond’ the South Gate, was 
saled not Fish Street but Grandpont (Salter, Names of Oxford Streets, 
7-8).

THE RISE OF THE MEDIZVAL UNIVERSITY 47 
Archdeacon who founded it, as Burnel’s Inn.1 The Hall 
developed for a time into a College, and was finally swept into 
Christ Church by the sharp practice of Wolsey and his master. 
But in early days the Jews still held the field. Shocked 
Christian chroniclers have told the story of Deus-eum-crescat, 
the insolent and powerful Jew—his name represents a translation 
from the Hebrew, not a Christian wish—who openly mocked the 
miracles wrought at St. Frideswide’s shrine. A later story tells 
how in 1244 the Scholars raided the Jewry so audaciously that it 
needed all Bishop Grosseteste’s influence to get the rioters released 
from prison. But the quarrel resulted in a Royal Charter which 
notably increased the Chancellor’s jurisdiction. And later still, 
on Ascension Day 1268, the Jews were the aggressors in an attack 
upon the clergy, long commemorated in the penalty they paid. 
While the Cross was being carried through the town ina procession, 
it was snatched from the bearer and trampled underfoot. The 
offenders were sentenced to provide as an atonement both a great 
cross of marble to be set up in the street, and a silver crucifix for 
the University to carry in similar processions upon ceremonial 
days. 
The University was now grown too strong to attack. Its 
ancient customs had become established. Side by side with 
regulations for enforcing order, rules for its internal administration 
had grown up. But some of the earliest Statutes only endorsed 
practices already in existence, or referred to legislation, perhaps 
not very formal or conclusive legislation, which had gone before. 
They say, “‘ it is ordered,” or “‘ it is the custom,” ® that such and 
such a rule shall be observed, without quoting the authority from 
whom the ordinance proceeds; and it is not certain that the 
Chancellor was necessarily a party to these decrees. Sometimes 
the ordinance is issued by the common consent or counsel of the 
Masters. Occasionally the Chancellor alone publishes a mandate 
or a prohibition. On one occasion a decree is made by the 
authority of the Chancellor and Regent Masters, with the unani- 
mous consent of the Non-Regents. On another, in 1253, the

2See ante (pp. 38). Later on, in 1260, the Constable of the Castle 
tried to limit the Chancellor’s authority over the Jews, but the town 
upheld the Chancellor (Lyte, 59). In 1286 Edward I gave the Chancellor 
jurisdiction in all personal actions and contracts between Jews and 
scholars, and the right to imprison Jews (Med. Arch. I, 40, and 
Collectanea, II, 286).

University makes an order, but adds that, if the order has been 
made already, it confirms it afresh.1 A little later we are told 
that the Chancellor and University of Regent Masters agree to 
a certain form of ordinance.? But the constitutional forms are 
still unsettled, and the chief object of legislation is to supplement 
the customary law. 
Only a few Statutes of the University can be definitely assigned 
to a date before 1275. It was custom which originally settled the 
rents of houses and the tenancy of Halls.* It was custom which 
at first decided academical dress and academical procedure. © It 
was custom which gave the Faculty of Arts its great predomin- 
ance, its practical veto on University business, its claim to meet 
and consider questions before they came up in Congregation. It 
was custom, the custom of Paris, which long dictated the methods 
of teaching. It was custom, as the Masters in 1280 assured 
Bishop Sutton of Lincoln, and as the Bishop in the following year, 
after the intervention of the Archbishop, grudgingly allowed, 
which gave them the right to inquire into the delinquencies of 
scholars, and which gave the Chancellor jurisdiction to try them 
and to prove their wills.5 It was custom, no doubt, which 
gradually settled the whole system of admission for degrees.* 
And it was obstinate custom which for five centuries and a half 
preserved as a part of that ritual the strange old oath never to 
consent to the reconciliation of “ Henry Simeonis,’ which 
originated in an affray of 1242, and which may have had some 
connection with the migration to Northampton in 1264.7 
1‘*Statuit Universitas Oxoniensis, et, si statutum fuerit, iterato 
consensu corroborat ”’ (Mun. Acad. 25). 
2“TIn hance formam consentiunt Cancellarius et Universitas Magis- 
trorum regentium Oxonie, ordinantes quod, etc.’ (Mun. Acad. 30). 
3 By the King’s writ of 1231 assessments of scholar’s houses are to be 
made according to the custom of the University (Cal. C. R., 1227-31, 587). 
“See Grosseteste’s Letter of 1240, which preceded the ‘Pope’ s Bull on 
the subject (Epistole, Rolls Series, 346). 
®In May 1281 Bishop Sutton agreed that the correction of spiritual 
offences in members of the University should be left to the Chancellor 
(Med. Arch. I, 37-9). See also later (p. 166). 
* Confirmed of course by Statutes, as time went on. The ordinance 
for the admission of Determiners was drawn up by 1o elected Masters in 
1267, and confirmed and sealed next year (Mun. Acad. 34-6). 
7 The origin of this strange old vow has been explored by Dr. R. L. 
Poole (Eng. Hist. Rev. July 1912). It seems that Henry son of Henry 
son of Simeon, a citizen of Oxford, was concerned in the death of one or 
more scholars in 1242. He apparently tried to buy the King’s pardon, 
and leave to return to Oxford from which he had fled. The King, perhaps 
moved by sordid considerations, was willing to allow his return, if the 
University consented. But the University steadily refused, and threatened 
to leave Oxford if the King insisted. The incident may have been one 
cause of the secession to Northampton. The oath was maintained till 
1827, though an unsuccessful attempt to abolish it was made in 1651.

  THE RISE OF THE MEDIAIVAL UNIVERSITY 49 
As the thirteenth century proceeded, the activity and reputa- 
tion of the University increased. When Archbishop Boniface 
visited Oxford, to denounce a brother Bishop, he was met, the 
chronicler tells us, by so imposing a multitude of clerks, that all 
the world was compelled to admit that the University was a . 
worthy rival of Paris. When Henry III wanted support against 
another Bishop, he applied to Oxford Masters learned in the 
law.1 When Bishop Lexington of Lincoln tried to limit the 
independence of the Masters, they appealed successfully to 
Pope and King. Henry III was warned that, if the University 
were interfered with, ‘the second School of the Church, nay, 
the foundation of the whole Church,” would be endangered. 
“ Heaven forbid that that should happen, least of all in my time,” 
said the pious King. And Innocent IV with characteristic 
vigour stepped in to protect the University’s liberties and rights. 
The Bishops of London and Salisbury were charged to see that 
its members were not molested. Its “laudable, ancient and 
tational customs” were solemnly confirmed. The persons and 
goods of its Masters and scholars were placed under the protection 
of the Apostolic See.? The terms of the agreement made with 
the Bishop of Lincoln in 1257 are not exactly known to us, and 
the issue may not have been pressed to a decision. But it seems 
clear that the University was claiming the right to discipline its 
Masters and to govern itself. At any rate by the middle of the 
century its sense of its own powers was growing and its recorded 
legislation had begun. And it is characteristic of Oxford that 
one of its earliest and most famous Statutes should have refused 
to give a degree in Theology to any student who had not previously 
taken a degree in Arts.‘ 
The fame of the University was now established, but it was 
1“* Magistros Oxonie in Jure legentes.’’ This was in 1243. (Patent 
Rolls, 28 Hen, III, m. to.d., or p. 438 of the Calendar, printed in English.) 
In Jan. 1244 Henry offered to appeal further to Paris, to ‘‘ all the Masters 
Regent in law.’’ See also Matt. Paris (Chron. Maj. IV, 265, and V, 
352-3 and 618). 
® Mun. Acad. (26-30). The date is 1254. In the same year Innocent 
IV promised that for five years Masters and scholars should not be 
summoned to answer outside Oxford for contracts made in Oxford (Papal 
Letters, I, 306). The Pope’s intervention may have been due to needless 
interference on the Bishop’s part. 
* Ann. Monastici (ed. Luard, I, 436). The University claimed the 
right to suspend Regents who did not fulfil their obligations, and the 
Bishop had treated this as an infringement of his authority (Rashdall, II, 
420). 
«Quod nullus in eadem Universitate incipiat in theologia nisi prius 
Texerit in artibus in aliqua Universitate’? (Mun. Acad. 25). For the 
history of the Statute of 1253, see later (pp. 72 sq.). It is the first written 
Statute to which a date can be assigned—March 1253, not 1252, as Mr. 
Anstey, followed by Dean Rashdall (II, 362), gives it.

through its teachers that that fame was won. Before the end of 
the twelfth century Edmund Rich had studied at Oxford and at 
Paris, had set his ring upon the Virgin’s finger and chosen her 
for his bride. In the early years of the century which followed 
he taught the new logic to Oxford students, until, warned by a 
vision to abandon secular learning, he gave himself up to theology 
and became the most inspiring preacher of his day. ‘ Study,” 
he told his young disciples, ‘‘ as if you were to live for ever: live 
as if you were to die to-morrow.” But he was as tender to their 
shortcomings as he was harsh and austere towards his own. 
Tradition would connect with St. Peter’s in the East at Oxford 
the little, ancient chapel which he built.1_ His memory lingers 
in the lanes about it, though seven centuries have gone by since 
he ceased to teach. The first recorded Master of Arts, Edmund 
Rich was also, it seems, the first Doctor of Divinity at Oxford. 
He was in due time appointed Archbishop of Canterbury and 
canonized as Saint. The old Chronicle of Lanercost tells us that 
the Schools in his day were in the churchyard of St. Mary’s close 
by the Western doors.* Here already ran the ancient Schools 
Street, which Wood was tempted to call the Street of Minerva, 
where all things “in relation towards the soule and accomplish- 
ment of man” were “only with the price of patience and 
endeavour ’”’ to be obtained.® 
Edmund Rich had hardly passed from Oxford before Robert 
Grosseteste was a leader in its Schools. Adam Marsh, the 
“Doctor Illustris,’’ succeeded later to Grosseteste’s authority, 
and is classed with him by Roger Bacon as one of the “ greatest 
clerks in the world.” Bacon himself eclipsed them both. But 
the story of those three rare spirits is part of the story of the 
Oxford Friars. In Bacon the young University could lay claim 
to the most original genius of the Middle Ages. And from Oxford 
came in Bacon’s day some of the best mathematicians of the 
time.4 William of Drogheda, a Civilian of distinction, lectured 
in the Oxford Schools on Civil Law. His name still lingers in 
the High Street in the house he owned.’ Ralph of Maidstone, 
one of the English Masters who left Paris in the migration of 
1229, was well known afterwards at Oxford as scholar, Chancellor 
and Friar. Richard of Wych, who also figures in the list of

Hall had nothing to do with Edmund Rich. There are several old lives 
of St. Edmund. One, still unprinted, is among the MSS. of Balliol College.

Chancellors, was once a Worcestershire squire or yeoman, whose 
natural holiness old biographies lovingly record. Student and 
teacher afterwards at Oxford, Paris and Bologna, he became the 
life-long friend of Edmund Rich. He succeeded to an English 
Bishopric at Chichester, and like his friend and master to the 
honours of a Saint.1. Walter de Grey is said to have been an 
Oxford pupil of St. Edmund’s, but a man of little learning in spite 
of his success. He too passed to an Archbishopric, for which 
he offered an enormous sum, and a prelate who stood so high in 
King John’s favour can hardly have been altogether worthy of 
respect. Grey kept great state at York, and settled on his See 
two famous houses, Bishopthorpe and York Place afterwards 
Whitehall. Accused of avarice and harsh dealings, he yet 
established some claim to be regarded as a good Bishop and a 
good patriot in his latter days. And in a younger generation 
Thomas de Cantelupe, born of a family with strong influence at 
Court, a Master of Arts of Paris, and in Oxford a successful teacher 
of the Canon Law, was perhaps the most magnificent Oxonian 
of his time. At Paris his wealth and hospitality had made him 
famous. At Oxford his piety was as conspicuous as the style 
in which he lived. When he took his degree as a Doctor of 
Divinity, about the age of fifty-four, his old master, Archbishop 
Kilwardby, declared him to be ‘“‘ as pure in mind and body as 
on the day of his birth.”’ His hair-shirt proved him an ascetic. 
His lectures on the Scriptures showed him a divine. His many 
benefices left him still a conscientious pluralist. His prejudices 
made him distrustful of all women—none, however old or ugly, 
were permitted in his house—and still more obstinately distrustful 
of the Jews. His public spirit made him an active Chancellor 
of the University, ready to sacrifice even his garments in trying 
to stop a fray. It made him, moreover, a friend of the great 
Earl Simon, till the battle of Evesham closed that chapter in his 
career. And it made him in later days the trusted adviser of 
King Edward, who sometimes recognised the value of a high- 
minded and honourable foe.2- Though excommunicated once by 
Archbishop Patcham,* Thomas of Cantelupe was canonised after 
1 Acta Sanctorum (X, 276-316). See also Lyte (60-1). 
2 Prof. Tout gives a full account of the authorities for Thomas de 
Cantelupe’s life in D.N.B. See also Canon Capes’ Introduction to his

‘ociety.

he most likely bore.

his death. His name ends the list of Englishmen and Oxford 
scholars admitted to that lofty dignity by the Church of Rome. 
Simon de Montfort had many friends in Oxford. The 
gathering of the Barons there in 1258, nicknamed the Mad 
Parliament, must have found adherents in both University and 
Town. It produced among other things the first Royal proclama- 
tion ever published in the English tongue. As the struggle 
between Henry and Earl Simon proceeded, the University showed 
its sympathies by lending money tothe Barons—money given for 
poor scholars and taken from William of Durham's Chest. In 
1263 or 1264 the scholars themselyes were drawn into the struggle. 
Prince Edward, passing to the Western marches—so Robert of 
Gloucester tells us in his rhyming Chronicle—lay at the Palace 
outside the North wall. The Town authorities, foreseeing 
trouble, shut the gates against him, and the scholars found 
themselves cooped up inside. Determined to get out to the 
playing fields at Beaumont, they fetched axes and hewed down the 
doors at Smith’s Gate,1 chanting over them cheerfully the 
office for the dead. The Mayor, regardless of the Chancellor’s 
protests, clapped the offenders into prison. The clerks rang the 
bell of St. Mary’s and rushed out to give battle to their foes. 
| Shops were plundered, taps set flowing—the Mayor was a vintner 
—till the wine ran down the streets. Complaints to the 
authorities followed. Some of the students, it seems, left the 
town and joined a colony of Cambridge scholars at Northampton, 
which had been driven there by a conflict with the Cambridge 
townsmen three years before. In March 1264 the King, about 
to unfurl his standard at Oxford, and perhaps mistrusting the 
loyalty of the clerks, ordered the Masters to withdraw to their 
homes. - But the students flocked in great numbers to Northamp- 
ton, where a new University was springing into life. When Henry 
marched upon Northampton, fresh from a visit to St. Frideswide’s 
shrine, he found Oxford scholars in arms against him, and came 
near to hanging the prisoners he took. The battle of Lewes 
followed, fulfilling the old warning which boded ill to any King 
who entered within Oxford walls. Within a few weeks of his 
victory Simon in the King’s name invited the exiled Masters to 
return.? The settlement at Northampton proved to be short- 
1 Where Catharine Street (the old Cat Street) joins Broad Street, and 
where the town wall ran. 
2 See Med. Arch. (I, 24-5), and Cal. Pat. Rolls, 1258-66 (320). The 
story of the dispersal to Northampton, as told by the old chroniclers, is 
not very clear. Sir H. C. M. Lyte (63-6) follows Robert of Gloucester, 
and it is likely enough that the sharp dispute between Town and Gown 
over the imprisonment of clerks arose out of Prince Edward’s visit. The 
tumult is placed by some chroniclers in 1263, and it probably was one cause,

lived. Thomas de Cantelupe, the Chancellor of Oxford, was 
made Chancellor of the distracted kingdom. But the scholars 
seem in no way to have suffered when the popular leaders fell. 
After the Barons’ War was over the King’s graciousness to the 
University revived, and the end of the long reign found its 
prosperity still growing and its rights and liberties secure. 
if not the main cause, of the migration to Northampton (Chron. of Abingdon. 
ed. Halliwell, 16-17, and Ann. Monast., Oseney, ed. Luard, IV, 139~41). 
On the other hand, Henry’s order to the University to go home (Cal. P. R., 
/1258-66, 307) was probably due in part to doubts about its loyalty 
(Rishanger’s Chron., ed. Halliwell, 22), and not only to the quarrel with 
the town (Aun. Monast., Winton, ed. Luard, II, 101). It may have been 
preceded by an attempt to bring the Northampton students back to 
Oxford. When the migration to Northampton began is uncertain. 
Mr. C. H. Cooper in his Annals of Cambridge (I, 48) suggests that Oxford 
students were already at Northampton in 1261. But the King’s mandate, 
approving the settlement of ‘‘ certain masters and scholars”’ there, dated 
Feb. 1261 (Cal. P. R., 1258-66, 140), more probably refers to the students 
from Cambridge. See also Floves Histoviarum (ed. Luard, II, 487), - 
Chron. of Edward I and II (ed. Stubbs, I, 61), and Rashdall (II, 395 and 
notes), The migration to Northampton was for a time a removal of the 
University wholesale.

  CHAPTER III 
THE FRIARS IN OXFORD 
Oxford that, while the young University was establishing 
its fortunes, a new ideal was being established in the Church. 
In the year of St. Thomas’ murder at Canterbury St. Dominic 
was born in Old Castile, and from his stern and orthodox devotion 
the brotherhood of the Preaching Friars arose. Eleven or 
twelve years later there was born at Assisi;in a wealthy merchant’s 
house, a gentler dreamer no less insistent on reform, who disdain- 
ing wealth and knowledge set himself with something of his 
Master’s high simplicity to win mankind to holiness by teaching | 
them the power of. love. 
Both these preachers of unworldly doctrines received an 
astonishing welcome from the world. The best minds of the 
early thirteenth century were already dissatisfied and ill at ease. 
The Crusades, which had stirred men’s hearts so deeply, had 
helped to shake the -old beliefs.1 It was not blind prejudice 
only which made the medieval churchman dread Oriental 
learning and the spells which the Saracens threw upon the West. 
In religion and politics, in science and in morals, new tastes and 
disorders were working, and working in the direction of supersti- 
tion or revolt. The Church, though in some respects more 
authoritative and triumphant than she had ever been before, 
was in danger of becoming the Church of the rich, cumbered 
with possessions and intent on power. The parish clergy, 
declining in energy and discipline, shared the lax morals of the 
day. St. Bernard, with his unfailing eye for Christian weakness, 
had declared the priests to be worse than the people. Bishop 
Grosseteste had to complain of a candidate for ordination coming 
to him dressed in rings and scarlet like a courtier, and to warn 
his clergy against drinking-bouts and playing publicly at dice. 
Patronage was constantly abused. Unfit and ignorant clergy 
were appointed. Out of a hundred and fifty-six presentations 
made in sixteen years in the Archdeaconry of Oxford, only 
thirteen of the clergy presented seem to have been University I: was a happy circumstance for the spirit and studies of 
  
1 But the introduction of Oriental science into Europe was due more 
to Spanish influences than to the Crusades in the East, 
54
-P-A-G-E-76
THE FRIARS IN OXFORD 55 
then.1 The Bishop had to insist on the recipients of livings 
attending “the Schools” before they entered on their duties. 
Thirteenth-century reports on the examinations of priests 
indicate the educational standards of the time. “ Amply 
illiterate” is the comment on one. “ He is a youth and knoweth 
nothing’ is the verdict on another. A third “ knew not how to 
chant.” A fourth ‘‘knew nothing, whether of reading or of 
singing.” A fifth. ‘‘ when asked to parse omni, said it was an 
adverb ;’’ when pressed for the meaning of “ annual,’’ he suggested 
“many times” or “every day.’ Standards of character were 
little higher. The priest’s heart was too often ‘“‘in the market- 
place or street or bed.’’ Sloth and negligence, irreverence and 
carelessness, were among the least of the offences charged. 
Incontinence and drunkenness figured among them. Clerical 
concubines were not uncommon. Quoit-player, dicer, tavern- 
haunter, leper, were terms applied to clergymen, even if not 
deserved. One dealt in corn at usurious prices. Another went 
about with a sword. A third refused to wear a cassock. ‘‘ Foul 
and unhonest chants” were heardinchurches. ‘Noxious games’’ 
were played there during Mass. Ministers in the diocese of 
Exeter threw snuffings from the candles at the Choir, and indulged, 
we are told, in ‘“‘ obscene orgies of gesticulations.” Livings fell 
to the wrong men. Some were too poor to be worth acceptance. 
The rich ones were often given for unworthy reasons to rectors 
who put in a vicar ‘‘ of the cheapest ’’ to do their work.? 
In the meanwhile Sunday observances were to a large extent 
neglected. Preaching and practical Christianity decayed. The 
monks, isolated in their splendid solitudes, might battle with 
their own temptations, or work for the glory and influence of 
the great Houses to which they belonged. But they left mankind 
beyond the cloister to struggle for themselves. Reformers rose 
in the Monastic Orders, but reforms brought fame and riches, 
and riches in turn led to ease and apathy. The Benedictine 
and Cluniac Monasteries had grown too fond of comfort. Their 
wealth was a byword. Giraldus Cambrensis marvelled at the 
table kept by the monks of Canterbury, at their levity and 
luxury, their wines and dishes.? The Cistercians, seeking a 
1“ Magistri,’’ which does not here necessarily imply an M.A. degree. 
In the Archdeaconry of Buckingham there were only 5 ‘“‘ Magistri”’ out 
of 138 presentations. (See Rotuli Hugonis de Welles, 1206-35, I, xii—xvii. 
in the publications of the Canterbury and York Society.) 
2 See the passages quoted by Mr. Coulton in A Medieval Garner (270-9, 
290-5, 312-15, 340 and 582). There was little difference, apparently, 
between England and abroad. 
3 De rebus a se gestis (Pt. II, cap. 5). Compare the installation-feast 
of a Prior of St. Augustine’s, Canterbury, in 1309, with its 6,000 guests, 
and its bill estimated by Mr. Coulton (Med. Garner, 677) at £5,000 in 
modern money.

56 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
stricter life far from the crowds and enticements of the world, 
had from the first turned their backs on the towns. But they 
had degenerated into wealthy landowners, and by no means 
commanded universal respect. Walter Map indeed, the witty 
Archdeacon of Oxford, freely denounced the Cistercian Order as 
men to whom equal justice was an abomination. Devoted monks 
and priests there were, no doubt, in every diocese and Order. 
But for the laity Bishop Golias stood as the type of a degenerate 
churchman—a hero of drinking-songs who hated thirst like death, 
and whose ambition it was to die in a tavern.t 
“Meum est propositum 
In taberna mori, 
Ubi vina proxima 
Morientis ori.” 
The towns, neglected by the Monasteries but daily growing in 
strength and independence, the wretched population which they 
sheltered, beset too often with squalor and disease, were losing 
faith in spiritual things, when suddenly a missionary movement, 
addressed directly to the town-dwellers in their distress, swept 
like a flame through the medieval Church, and with its fire of 
practical devotion lit a new hope in the hearts of the poor. 
St. Dominic had seen heresy at close quarters in the Albigensian 
War, and had learned, not the lesson of tolerance, but the dangers 
threatening society from sectaries and Saracens and Jews. His 
aim was to champion orthodoxy, to confute heretics, to encourage 
sound learning. The days of remote contemplation were over. 
The day for a living and fighting Christianity had come. Dominic’s 
disciples were to be essentially preachers of the faith, instructed, 
fervent and austere. But their appeal was to the educated 
classes. The new seats of learning were their natural home 
The renunciation of endowments was, it seems, no part of 
Dominic’s original plan. His special gift was the power of organ- 
isation, while the strength of St. Francis lay in his mystic and 
spiritual charm. But Dominic appreciated at once the force and 
popularity which the Franciscans drew from their self-denying 
creed. As early as 1220 the Friar Preachers adopted the profession 
of poverty, which the Lesser Friars, the Minorites, had already 
made their own, and side by side, as Mendicants, the two Orders 
travelled out to take the world by storm. In 1221 the Dominicans 
1See T. Wright’s Latin Poems aitributed to Walter Mapes (71-5 and 
Preface), Mullinger’s Cambridge (86-7), and J. A. Symonds’ Wine, Women 
and Song (20 sq.). There are different versions of the song. It is hardly 
fair to make the Archdeacon responsible for the drinking-song, which 
is probably much older than his day ; and there is no more evidence for 
attributing to him the original of the great tale of Lancelot du Lac (see 
Cambridge Hist. of Eng. Lit., I, 177-8 and 188-91). 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  THE FRIARS IN OXFORD 57 
landed in England, and passing on in a few days to Oxford, found 
their first lodging in the heart of the Jewry, where there were 
most converts to be made. In St. Edward’s parish they set up 
their oratory and school, and from the date of their arrival it 
seems that their welcome was assured. Their skill in preaching 
and in dialectics won educated hearers. Their simplicity, poverty, 
enthusiasm appealed to all. Old pupils of St. Edmund, Robert 
Bacon and Richard Fishacre, appeared among their earliest 
teachers. Great personages like the Bishop of Carlisle and the 
widowed Countess of Oxford granted property for their use. 
Ere long the Bishop resigned his See and joined their ranks. 
The King gave them wood from Shotover and Wychwood. The 
Jews gave them a few converts—most precious of all. Before 
many years were over 1 the Black Friars sold their home in the 
Jewry, and moved to larger quarters outside the Little Gate, 
beyond the South wall. Their patrons had bestowed on them 
an island between Trill Mill Stream and the Thames, and here 
already a new Convent had begun to rise. Here on stone arches 
over Trill Mill Stream they built their Preacher's Bridge. Here 
they established church and mill and school and cloister. Here 
names like Blackfriars Road and Preachers’ Pool for long recalled 
them. And here, to the North-west, in St. Ebbe’s Parish, and in 
the low ground by the town wall, they had for neighbours the 
only community in Oxford which could outshine them in piety 
or fame. 
Before the Dominicans had been long settled in the Jewry, 
the Franciscans followed in their steps. In September 1224 
there arrived at Dover a little party of bare-footed Friars, garbed 
in the coarse, grey habit of their Brotherhood, and led by Agnellus 
of Pisa, whom St. Francis had chosen for the difficult task. 
Homeless and penniless, save for the charity of the monks of 
Fécamp, who had paid their passage over, they made their way 
to Canterbury and found a shelter. From Canterbury four of 
the Friars, with two Englishmen among them, went on to London. 
There the Dominicans made them welcome, and there in Cornhill 
they. built their first rough cells, stuffing the party-walls with 
grass. From London soon afterwards ? the same two Englishmen,

English Dominicans (especially Ch. IV) and Mr. W. G. D. Fletcher’s 
Black Friars in Oxford. But our knowledge of them is slender compared 
with our knowledge of the Franciscans. See also Wood (City, II, 311-42), 
Stevens (Additions to Dugdale’s Monasticon, II, 203-7), and the Victoria

Lectures there are interesting sketches of St. Dominic, St. Francis and 
the early Friars.

London. This is most likely Eccleston’s meaning (Brewer’s edition, 9,

Richard of Ingworth in Norfolk and another Richard from 
Devonshire, set out again, and in spite of perils from forest and 
flood, in spite of an inhospitable Prior at Abingdon; who judged 
them to be mummers and not men of God, they arrived at Oxford 
safely. There too the Dominicans lodged and fed the new- 
comers, till they could hire a primitive dwelling of their own. 
And there they rented first a house from Robert the Mercer 
in the parish of St. Ebbe, and later, in the following summer, 
a larger house with some ground about it, which before long 
Richard the Miller settled in trust for their use. The first Warden 
of the Oxford house was an Englishman, William of Esseby, 
who as a young novice had accompanied the mission from abroad. 
Many “‘ honest bachelors and noble men ” soon joined the Order. 
Sympathisers and enthusiasts brought them gifts. Fresh houses 
in St. Ebbe’s were dedicated to them; and as years went on 
they were able to enlarge their quarters in the South-West corner 
of the town. 
In 1244 the Grey Friars received the King’s permission to 
break through the South wall, between Little Gate on the East 
and the Castle on the West, and like the Dominicans they were 
granted an island in the Thames, with the right to connect it 
by a bridge with their main possessions. The island perhaps 
helped to pay the fine imposed on Henry son of Henry son of 
Simeon for his inexpiable crime.1 Here, in the poor, low-lying 
suburb, the first humble buildings of the Order were set up. 
The Brothers worked with their own hands at the church; a 
Bishop and an Abbot, who had donned the Mendicant habit, 
helped to carry water, sand and stone. Luxury in their dwellings 
was forbidden. St. Francis had told them that the best of 
sermons was to live in ‘ poor cottages of mud and wood,” and the 
Little’s edition, 11-12), though Denifle and others have accepted the view, 
which Eccleston indeed suggests, that the Friars stayed in London a 
year before going on to Oxford. The theory which dates the Grey Friars’ 
arrival in England in 1219 instead of 1224 is discussed at the beginning of 
Mr. A. G. Little’s admirable volume on The Grey Friars in Oxford (1, n.). 
Mr. Little’s edition of Eccleston’s Chronicle (Tvactatus Fr. Thoma, Paris, 
1909) is the latest and best. Consult also Little’s Studies in English 
Franciscan History; the two volumes: of Monumenta Fvranciscana—in- 
cluding Thomas Eccleston’s Chronicle and Adam Marsh’s Letters—edited 
with a brilliant preface by Dr. Brewer ; Luard’s edition of Grosseteste’s 
Letters; Wood (City, II, 342-413); and Dr. Jessop’s Coming of the 
Friars. 
1The island was granted in 1245 (Cal. P. R., 1232-47, 451). An 
annuity of 50 marks was granted to the Warden and Convent of the 
Friars Minor of Oxford by Edward I. Under Edward II they petitioned 
for a license in mortmain—“ la mortificacioun de une place en Oxenford 
qe ne vaut ge deux souz par an.” (See Parliamentary Petitions in 
Collectanea, III, 141 and 116.)

  THE FRIARS IN OXFORD 59 
strictest of his followers clung to this injunction as an article of 
faith. The chief house of the Order in England grew up near 
the shambles of Newgate in Stinking Lane.1 The Franciscan 
Chapel at Cambridge is said to have been built by a single 
carpenter in a single day. The dormitory walls at Shrewsbury, 
first built of stone, were afterwards replaced with mud. A 
vision warned the Oxford Friars that men might be damned for 
excess in building. Jealous critics, monkish historians, were on 
the watch to accuse them of rearing “ mansions as lofty as the 
palaces of Kings.” Adam Marsh feared lest his novices should 
neglect the things of the spirit for flesh and blood and wood and 
stone and worldly gain. Even Grosseteste preached against such 
dangerous ambitions. The school reared in the days of Agnellus 
was probably one of the best of the Grey Friars’ early buildings 
in Oxford. The infirmary was built by his orders so low that a 
man could scarcely stand upright in it. It was not till the first 
and sternest years were over, that the spacious Convent of the 
Order was designed, and the great church built for preaching, 
where “‘ under a sumptuous pyramid ”’ the heart of its wealthiest 
benefactor, Richard King of the Romans, was laid. But time 
and prejudice were destined to sweep both away. No traces of 
either simplicity or splendour recall the cloisters of the Minorites 
among the Oxford marshes now. 
“« Three things chiefly have exalted the Order,” said one of the 
Franciscan leaders, ‘‘ bare feet, mean garments? and the refusal 
of money ”’—and there is no doubt that their single-minded 
poverty gave the Mendicants more than anything else their 
hold upon the times. Even braver than their poverty, however, 
was the devotion with which the Grey Friars ministered to the 
sick, and dedicated themselves to the service of the lepers, the 
most dreaded outcasts of the medieval world. In thirteenth- 
century Europe no harder or truer test could have been devised 
of a man’s readiness to sacrifice himself for others. St. Francis 
was a poet and he loved mankind.* It was bitter and loathsome 
to him once, he confessed, even to look upon a leper. But “ the 
blessed Lord brought me among them and I did mercy with them:” 
and mercy and tenderness brought their own reward. Their 
work among the sick led the Friars to study medicine and physical 
conditions as few had done before, and gave a valuable stimulus 
1 But there was no deliberate choice of unhealthy sites. The Friars 
took such sites as they could get, and sometimes cheap ones bought by 
public subscription.

to experimental science. Hardly less powerful in their appeal to 
popular feeling, tothe humble and neglected dwellers in the towns, 
were the personal and sentimental elements in the Franciscan 
creed, the Brothers’ constant insistence on the humanity and 
sufferings of Christ, on the purity and womanhood of the Virgin 
Mother of God. The Grey Friar had to preach to unlearned 
men. Dependent as he was upon his audience, he was com- 
pelled to find a way to touch their feelings. And nothing helped 
him more than the joyousness of spirit, which the Order, 
following its Founder’s example, made its own. Laughter, it 
seems, was the young Oxford Friar’s temptation. He had to 
be forbidden to laugh too much at his prayers. Cheerfulness 
and gaiety were almost a part of his rule. Excessive austerity 
in diet was discouraged. As guests at other men’s tables the 
Brothers were allowed to eat all manner of meats. Grosseteste 
once imposed a cup of wine for a penance: ‘to eat, sleep and 
be merry,’ he told them, were all alike necessary to health. 
Psalms and hymns had no sadness for these ‘‘ jongleurs of God.” 
They could weep indeed because Love was not loved: the Dies 
Ive was a Franciscan hymn. But joy in life was a part of their 
creed. To be a good fellow, to tell a good story, to carry the 
news and gossip of the neighbourhood through the country-side, 
were by no means repugnant to the Minorite ideal. The warm 
human sympathies, the wide understanding which won for the 
Friars the hearts of the poor, made friends as readily among 
important people. We find them mingling in public affairs, 
acting as counsellors, diplomatists, Crusaders. Oxford Minorites 
were used as Royal envoys. Adam Marsh was sent as an Ambas- 
sador over seas. A Master of the Oxford Friars was taken as a 
companion by Prince Edward to the Holy Land... Before the 
thirteenth century ended, a Warden of the Oxford Convent 
marched with the Crusaders, and. bore the Cross in the last fierce 
charge of the Christian Knights at Tripoli. ; 
St. Francis indeed, had he had his way, would have closed 
to his disciples one avenue of power. Books and learning had 
no place in his scheme. His sole aim was the practical imitation 
of Jesus. -“ A day will come,” he told his followers, ‘‘ when men 
will throw their books out of the window as useless.” The true 
Doctor was the man who showed good works. ‘‘ When you have 
got a psalter,’ he warned a timid novice, who had just learned 
to stumble through the psalms, ‘‘ then you will want a breviary ; 
and. when you have got a breviary, you will sit in your chair as 
great as a lord. . . . How many gape after knowledge! How 
much happier he who has made himself barren for the love of 
God!” And though St. Francis died, his spirit lingered, and 
the sterner zealots of the Order were long before they could
-P-A-G-E-82
THE FRIARS IN OXFORD 6r 
reconcile their aims with the ideals of University education. 
Roger Bacon had great difficulty in securing not only books and 
instruments but ink and parchment for his work. Even Agnellus, 
who built the Grey Friars’ School at Oxford, and persuaded 
Grosseteste to lecture in it, mourned over its vain dialectics. 
“Woe is me, woe is me! Simple brothers enter Heaven, while 
learned brothers dispute whether there be a God at all.” ? 
But the call of learning was too strong to be refused. 
Preachers dedicated to religion needed the stimulus of teaching. 
Even their simplicity longed to know more of the “subtle 
moralities ’’ about which Grosseteste spoke. So eager were they 
that they would go daily to the School of theology, ‘‘ barefoot, 
in bitter cold and deep mud.” ? Grosseteste, their earliest 
lecturer, was one of the first theologians of his time, and he 
warned them plainly that walking in ignorance meant walking 
to shame. His immediate successors in the School, like him 
seculars and ultimately Bishops, were all distinguished men. 
The necessity of studying theology and the Dominicans’ example 
had their inevitable effect. The rigid rules interfering with 
study were relaxed. Adam Marsh pleaded for concessions. 
The Franciscan lecturers appealed beyond their Convent to the 
University outside. The Mendicant Orders became famous for 
their learning, the Franciscans with their special attention to 
language and to science at least as conspicuous as the rest. 
Their libraries were said to be full of treasures—“ heaped up, 
amid the utmost poverty, the utmost riches of wisdom.” They 
were accused of buying up all the books in the market, of keeping 
books which did not belong to them, as jealous book-collectors 
are sometimes led to do—though Leland later could find in the 
Franciscan library at Oxford little except moths and cobwebs. 
By a strange irony the missionary Brotherhood, whom their 
Founder had directed to abandon learning, became the intellectual 
masters of their age, the pioneers of the most original philosophy 
and the boldest speculation in the medizval Church. 
The great reputation which the Franciscans won in Oxford 
was largely due to their early leaders. Agnellus of Pisa and the 
Englishmen who came over with him must have been remarkable 
men. And Robert Grosseteste, whom Agnellus drew into the 
service of the Order, became from the first an invaluable friend. 
Few figures loom larger in the first half of the thirteenth century 
in England. None is more representative of Oxford in its 
earliest days. None perhaps, even among the greatest medizval 
Doctors, had a wider influence than “ Lincolniensis’’ upon English

thought. A Head of the Schools who never failed to defend 
the University he loved, a Bishop who made himself felt in every 
part of his vast diocese, an untiring administrator, a fearless 
reformer, a statesman who never quailed before Pope or King 
when justice was at stake, Grosseteste was also one of the chief 
teachers and writers of his time. He did not always escape the 
pitfalls of an uncritical age.. He wasted labour in editing 
spurious Greek manuscripts.1_ But the list of works attributed 
to him shows the wide range of his mind. Foremost among 
contemporary divines, a Schoolman who yet saw the perils of 
Scholasticism, he urged the Oxford Masters of Divinity to take 
the Bible itself as the foundation of their teaching. His own 
Sayings placed the authority of Scripture above Pope or Council 
or text-book of the Church. Though not himself in the first 
rank of linguists, he realised the need of studying Greek and 
Hebrew. He set the scholars of St. Albans to translating 
Aristotle afresh. Tradition attributed to his influence the first 
direct translation of the Ethics, which Oxford men have thumbed 
and pondered for uncounted generations since. He shared 
Roger Bacon’s impatience with the confused, perplexing versions 
of Aristotle then current. He shared, he may have suggested, 
Bacon’s opinions on the importance of mathematics as the basis 
of physical science. He helped to make languages and mathe- 
matics appreciated at Oxford in the Franciscan School. Bacon 
spoke of his knowledge of ‘the sciences” with unmeasured 
admiration, and Bacon could be a sharp critic. Grosseteste’s 
labours and experiments, no doubt, suggested and anticipated 
Bacon’s, and his far-ranging studies included husbandry and 
medicine, poetry and music. He loved the harp: they said he 
kept a harper by him day and night.?_ He found time to rule a 
great diocese, to play a leading part in English politics and letters, 
to intervene, whenever -his intervention was needed, on his 
dear University’s behalf, to watch its officials, to advise on its 
studies, to plead for its turbulent clerks. He found time also 
to write French verses and to enjoy the lighter sides of life. He 
left a religious poem behind him which an eighteenth-century 
Professor compared to ‘‘a system of divinity written by a 
troubadour.” He was’a gracious, open-handed host, refreshing 
in his humour, simple in his human kindliness, as generous

from Athens by John of Basingstoke, who helped Grosseteste to trans- 
late it.

full account of the works attributed to the Bishop. See also Luard’s

Studies in English Franciscan History, Brewer’s Monumenta Franciscana,

always in appreciating merit as he was stern in punishing abuses. 
Severe to the faults of the monks, he was outspoken in his 
admiration of the spirit and labours of 'the early Friars. He 
became their staunchest patron. He wrote to the Pope with 
enthusiasm of their success. Drawn himself from the ranks of 
the people, he understood the force of their popular appeal. 
He left his books to the Franciscan House at Oxford, where they 
also preserved his sandals as relics. He would preach to them 
and joke with them and gently mock at their austerities, and 
bid them be merry as well as devout. It is no wonder that they 
sang his praises, and treasured up stories about him, and told 
each other solemn tales of the visions in which he appeared after 
death. j 
Even more closely associated with the Grey Friars was Adam 
de Marisco, Adam of the Marsh, who, eschewing wealth and 
worldly greatness, spent the best part of his life among them. 
His letters to Grosseteste, to Simon de Montfort, to other well- 
known correspondents, remain in all their tortuous Latinity, 
though unhappily we have no record of the replies.2 The 
“ Tllustrious Doctor,’’ whom Roger Bacon classed with Grosseteste 
as “‘ perfect in all wisdom,” was the first Brother of the Order 
to lecture at Oxford, and he did more perhaps than any other 
teacher to found the great Franciscan School. But to the last — 
he pleaded for the old ideal of poverty, for the stern simplicity 
of the Franciscan creed. Adam Marsh’s influence at Oxford 
was hardly less than Grosseteste’s own. He could speak not 
for the Minorites only, but for the whole University. When 
differences arose between them, his judgment and moderation 
helped to keep the peace. By the middle of the thirteenth 
century he was recognised as one of the leading churchmen of 
the day. He was summoned to attend a Parliament in London, 
to accompany Grosseteste to a Council at Lyons, to undertake 
missions for the King abroad. Princes and nobles, prelates and 
great ladies came to him for counsel. He was not afraid to 
preach an uncourtly sermon to his Sovereign, to show his sympathy 
with the great popular leader, to resist the exactions of the Pope, 
to insist on humanity and mercy towards the Jews. He did not 
hesitate to tell Simon de Montfort that a patient man is better 
than a strong man, “ and he who can rule his own temper than 
he who storms a city.” He would even write to the great Earl’s 
wife about the dangers of extravagance in dress and the sweetness

of humility in women. At Oxford he was ever working for the 
interests of his friends and students, interceding for the Chancellor 
with Grosseteste, appealing for assistance for poor scholars, 
begging for books for one, for parchment for another, for con- 
sideration for a third, for forgiveness for a fourth. But he had 
time enough still for the duties which made the Friars loved, 
and was just as ready to help and comfort all who came to him 
in trouble, a friend or neighbour broken by misfortune, a poor 
woman overwhelmed by lawyers, a horse-stealer brought by 
heavenly inspiration to a satisfactory consciousness of sin. 
Adam Marsh was not a man of genius. He probably owed his 
great reputation far more to his high character than to his 
scholarship or his exasperating literary style. But he was 
essentially, what Grosseteste found him, ‘‘a true friend and 
faithful counsellor,” and as such he filled in his generation no 
small place in the hearts of Oxford men. 
A far more famous name stands in the list of Adam’s disciples, 
a name linked with immortality, wizardry, romance. Roger 
Bacon’s life began early in the thirteenth century and continued 
almost to its close. He came of a family of some importance 
which suffered in the Royal cause. He was very likely a relative 
of Robert Bacon, the well-known Oxford teacher, who was one 
of the first Englishmen to join the Dominicans and to draw 
students to their Schools. He went, it seems, at an early age 
to Oxford, and became a devoted admirer of Grosseteste and of 
Adam Marsh.1 From boyhood onward he ‘‘ laboured much at 
sciences and languages.” The scientific writings of Aristotle, 
made available by Arabic students, were just becoming known 
in the Western world. Astronomy was already a popular science. 
Mathematics were advancing with Astronomy. Botany and 
Medicine were developing.2 And if Chemistry and Alchemy 
were still undefined and indistinguishable, the study of the 
metals was increasing every day. Bacon threw himself into 
these engrossing subjects. He spent his money freely on instru- 
ments and books. From Oxford he went abroad, stayed in 
Paris, lectured on the new Aristotelian science. By 1251, when 
he was again in Oxford, he was a well-known teacher and Master 
of Arts. In 1257 he was sent back to Paris, and there for several 
years he remained in the Franciscan Convent, ‘‘ unheard, buried, 
1 He may have heard Edmund Rich preach or lecture in Oxtord. But 
the days when St. Edmund was lecturing there regularly must have been 
over, even if Grosseteste’s lectures were still going on. 
2 The Emperor Frederick II insisted on the study of dissection in his 
Sicilian kingdom. (See Mr. Robert Steele’s essay on Bacon in the Studies 
in the History and Method of Science, edited by Dr. Charles Singer, II, 127, 
to which I am greatly indebted here.) And at Bologna both medicine 
and surgery were beginning to make way (Rashdall, I, 244-5).

lost in oblivion,” 1 but in spite of criticism, suspicion and hostility 
by no means lost to the cause of learning. 
It was an age of encyclopedias. Great teachers aimed at 
producing monumental books, which should sum up in all depart- 
ments the knowledge of mankind. Bacon seems to have followed 
the fashion, and to have collected materials for a vast and 
comprehensive work. He would arrange human learning under 
four main headings—Grammar and Logic, Mathematics, Natural 
Science, Metaphysics and Morals—and set forth a reasoned 
scheme of intellectual progress, leading up from the study of 
things human to the study of things divine. One faithful 
companion, a beggar-boy of genius, “ a virgin not knowing mortal 
sin,’ ? was trained to help him in his studies. And undeterred 
by the frowns of his Order, by difficulties with copyists and 
translators, by the want of money and materials and of nearly 
all that an investigator ought to have, the brave Friar laboured 
for years at his great task. Pope Clement IV heard of his struggles. 
In 1266 he asked to see his writings. And thereupon Bacon 
completed three treatises—the Opus Majus, the Opus Minus and 
the Opus Tertium—in a remarkably short time, and forwarded 
them for the Pope’s consideration. But these famous treatises, 
compiled, no doubt, from materials already collected, were little 
more than introductions to his comprehensive plan, and before 
the project went much further Clement died. 
Unhappily, while Popes changed, prejudice lived on. Bacon 
was not of a nature to conciliate opponents. He had little 
1Mr. Little (Roger Bacon; essays written for his seventh centenary, 
p. 7) points out that there is no ground in the Opus Tertium for supposing 
that Bacon was banished or imprisoned at this time. Like Mr. Steele’s 
article already referred to, these essays contain some admirable work on 
Bacon, including a valuable analysis quoted from the late Prof, Adamson 
and a valuable bibliography by Mr. Little. See also among other authori- 
ties, M. Charles (Roger Bacon, Sa Vie, etc.), Dr. Brewer’s edition of Bacon’s 
Opera Inedita (Rolls Series), Mr. Little’s Grey Friars and Studies in English 
Franciscan History, Dr. Rashdall’s Universities (II, 522 sq.), and Prof. 
Adamson’s article in D.N.B. with the references there given. Dr. 
Brewer’s volume of Bacon’s unedited works included the Opus Tertium, 
Opus Minus and Compendium Studii Philosophie. But Mr. Steele is now 
carrying forward Dr. Brewer’s plan, and has published since 1905 impor- 
tant editions of the Metaphysica, the Communia Naturalium (Books I and 
II), and the Secretum Secretorum. In recent years also Mr. J. H. Bridges 
has edited the Opus Majus, with a Life since separately published; Mr. 
Little has edited Part of the Opus Tertium, and Dr. Rashdall the Com- 
pendium Studii Theologie. M. Hauréau’s sketch of Bacon’s philosophy 
is a little disappointing (Hist. de la Philosoph. Scolast., Pt. II, t. ii, ch. 
XIX). Prof. Adamson (D.N.B.) gives details of early editions of parts of 
Bacon’s works.

mercy for his contemporaries’ failings. For popular opinion 
he had no respect at all. The strongest mind of the thirteenth 
century brought him little but trouble and discontent. When 
life went amiss with him, he broke out bitterly against the folly 
and unfairness of the world, against the ignorance and corruption, 
the pride and avarice, of Kings and prelates, monks and clerks.1 
There was no true understanding of the needs of education. 
The only study that prospered was the Civil Law. “ Evil- 
minded jurists” preoccupied the favour of Princes and carried 
off all favours and emoluments for themselves. The ‘‘ greedy 
Faculty ”’ grew rich, while the devotees of loftier studies had not 
the wherewithal to live. His complaints, no doubt, had some 
foundation; but if Bacon was dogged with unpopularity, he 
may have helped to bring it on himself. In 1278 his opinions 
were formally condemned, and he is said to have been imprisoned 
for some fourteen years. His last known work was written in 
1292, and he may in that year have regained his freedom. 
Tradition places his death soon afterwards, his unmarked grave 
among the Oxford Friars. And Oxford antiquarians, with even 
less to build on, for centuries gave the name of Friar Bacon’s 
Study to a little chamber in the tower by the South Bridge, 
where, it was said, the great magician of the Middle Ages, stealing 
over at night from his Convent, used often to climb up and 
commune with the stars. Pepys, running through the sights of 
Oxford, “a very sweet place,’ in one energetic day, paid a 
shilling to the man who showed it him in 1668.2 
It was easier, Leland declared, to collect the leaves of the 
Sibyl than the titles of the works written by Roger Bacon. 
Many of his writings still remain in manuscripts difficult of access 
and still more difficult to read. They must have been often 
copied in the Middle Ages, but it is uncertain how widely they 
were known. We may reject the story that the Friars at Oxford 
nailed down his dangerous books to the shelves. But for long 
after his death Bacon was most familiar to the public as an 
alchemist and wizard. It was not till the days of the Renaissance 
that his real fame revived. It was not till the seventeenth 
century that another English philosopher, sharing his name and 
his genius, pleaded as powerfully for observation and experiment 
as the true basis of knowledge. It was not till the eighteenth 
century that the Opus Majus found a publisher, and revealed 
1“ Totus clerus vacat superbie, luxurie, et avaritie ’’ (Brewer, Op. 
Ined. 399). 2 See his Diary for the 9th June, 1668. 
* There are, I understand, nearly 30 MSS, in the Bodleian, containing 
genuine works of Bacon. But Bacon, as Mr. Steele says, had an “ in- 
veterate habit of using his material two or three times over.”

THE FRIARS IN OXFORD 67 
the breadth of its author’s efforts to strengthen the thought and 
science of his age. Of the Friar’s vast projects little more than 
fragments are preserved. The Opus Majus was not only a 
criticism of the spirit in which scientific studies were pursued. 
It was an attempt to classify them and to expound a new scientific 
method with a thoroughness unknown since Aristotle’s day. 
What chiefly distinguished Bacon from his contemporaries was 
the originality and independence of his views. He was not 
content with quotations or commentaries upon others. To most 
of the Schoolmen science was largely a matter of words. To 
Bacon it was a matter of investigation. To him no form of 
inquiry came amiss. Moral Philosophy was, no doubt, the end 
of all the sciences, their mistress and queen: “for this alone 
teaches the good of the soul.’”’ But grammar and philology, 
astronomy and mathematics, agriculture and medicine, the study 
of plants and animals, and all forms of experimental science 
were within the compass of that busy, comprehensive mind. 
Bacon worked on the reform of the calendar, on optics or perspec- 
tive. He made burning glasses, magic mirrors. He studied 
the combination of lenses. He knew a man who had worked out 
the principle of a flying-machine. He searched the stars and 
their influence on the lives and passions of men. He plunged 
into alchemy, the mysterious science which awed and fascinated 
medieval thinkers. Speculative alchemy taught “‘ the generation 
of things from their elements.” Practical alchemy taught 
“how to make noble metals and colours,’’ and the rare art of 
prolonging life. He loved, no doubt, to linger on abnormal 
themes. In his version of the Secretum Secretorum, the fabled 
advice of Aristotle to Alexander, he turned aside from maxims 
of ethics, statesmanship, philosophy, to dwell on the enchantments 
of astrology, the strange concoctions of medieval physic, the 
restless quest of the philosopher’s stone. But there is nothing 
abnormal—indeed there is something curiously modern—in one 
of Bacon’s prescriptions for keeping young. ‘‘ Listen to beautiful 
music, look at beautiful things, hold stimulating conversations 
with sympathetic friends, wear your best clothes, and talk to 
pretty girls.” 1 Above all he saw the powerlessness of physical 
science unless it called in mathematics to its aid. He accepted 
Force and Matter as the fundamental physical ideas, and discerned 
with the intuition of genius that Force was invariably subject 
to mathematical laws. ‘‘ Impossibile est res hujus mundi sciri, 
nist sciatur mathematica.’ Mathematics were the master-key 
to all correct reasoning, to all accurate progress in understanding 
the secrets of the world.

    68 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
But after all the foundation of learning must be exactness 
in the use of language. That is why Bacon laboured at philology 
and produced the most remarkable Greek grammar of his day. 
He was hampered at every turn by inaccurate translations, 
which helped to make Scholasticism perplexing and obscure. 
His knowledge of the new Aristotle came to him chiefly from 
Arabic commentaries translated into Latin in Spain. But he 
saw the need of going to the fountain-head. He recognised as 
clearly as the men of the Renaissance the importance of studying 
in the originals both the text of Scripture and the science of 
Greece. Useless text-books must be swept away. He declared 
he did not know four men among the Latins who could translate 
grammatically Greek, Arabic or Hebrew. Yet it was from the 
East that all sciences sacred and profane had come. To clear 
thought on philosophic subjects language and not logic was the 
clue. No man in that period understood so well the immediate 
needs of education, all that the mastery of languages involved. 
He realised that teaching must be made attractive. “It is the 
first step in wisdom to have regard to those to whom one speaks.’’ 
Bacon saw plainly the failings of the Schoolmen. But it was 
to their age and race that he belonged, and his influence on 
Scholasticism has been partly lost sight of in his scientific fame. 
He had certainly no undue respect for custom and authority, or* 
for the blind deference which they commanded in the Schools. 
In his Compendium Studii Philosophia, produced about 1272, 
he had not spared the obscurantism of the clergy. He denounced 
the pride of supposed knowledge, the waste of energy involved 
in metaphysical debate. One individual was of more account 
than all the Universals in the world.2. He regretted, as Grosseteste 
had regretted, the time spent on studying text-books like the 
Sentences, instead of the Scriptures ‘‘ given to the world from the 
mouth of God and of the Saints.’”’ He complained of the ease 
with which half-trained and inexperienced boys became prema- 
turely Masters in Theology, a study “ which demands all human 
wisdom.” He found vanity, prolixity, unpardonable omissions 
even, unless the reference has been misunderstood, in the works 
of Thomas Aquinas. But a writer who dwelt with equal emphasis 
on the causes of perfect wisdom in Holy Scripture had no contempt 
for the best traditions of philosophy or religion. The first chapter 
of the Opus Majus strikes no uncertain note. ‘“‘ By the light of 
philosophy the Church of God is ordered.’ The last work he 
produced, the Compendium Studit Theologie, discussed as the 
Schoolmen might have discussed the causes and refutation of 
error. To Bacon the masters of antiquity were fallible like

others. But all great thinkers drew their enlightenment from God. 
He would use their wisdom fearlessly to illuminate and widen 
the learning of the Church. He would add to it new methods 
of searching out the truth. He would try to arrive at a know- 
ledge of the Creator by obtaining the fullest possible knowledge 
of the created world. For the inquirer entering on that high 
endeavour no field of study was too difficult or too remote. 
Bacon drew no followers round him. His loneliness lasted 
till the end. Proud, impatient, embittered by his treatment, 
he found little comfort or wisdom in the world. With all his 
power and genius he failed to make his ideas fully understood. 
But his writings had yet an appreciable influence on Oxford 
thought. Incomplete, at times perhaps uncertain, his handling 
of the problems of the Schools might bet But the germ of the 
opposition to the rising Dominican philosophy was there. And 
there too in characteristic vigour was the fine spirit of medizval 
independence, which made the Schoolman, with all his deference 
for authority, still an influence for freedom. In his criticism 
of the theories of Aquinas, Bacon, perhaps unconsciously, supplied 
materials which served the whole Franciscan School. He 
contributed something to the Realism of Duns Scotus, and some- 
thing also to the Nominalism of Ockham. Contemptuous of 
merely logical refinements, he yet helped to inspire the fearless 
thought, and even the over-subtle speculations, which were to 
render the Oxford philosophers of the fourteenth century in 
intellectual activity the leaders of the world. 
Other names, on which it is not possible to linger, bulk largely 
in the records of the Oxford Friars. Thomas de Bungay, the 
wizard associated with Bacon by tradition and romance, lectured 
to the Franciscans of Oxford and Cambridge in Bacon’s day, and 
shared, no doubt, his interest in mathematics and natural science. 
Earlier still, Richard of Cornwall and John of Wales were famous 
theologians, who not only lectured at Oxford, but won great 
reputations in Paris.2 John—‘ Wallensis’—was a_ prolific 
writer, many of whose studies on the virtues of philosophy and 
the temptations of mankind remain, Richard of Cornwall also 
enjoyed wide popularity, but that did not prevent Bacon from 
calling him an utter fool. Thomas of Eccleston was the first 
of the Friars’ historians. Adam of Oxford, ‘‘ of world-wide 
fame,” once secretary to Adam Marsh, was sent by the Pope 
to preach to the infidels. Ralph of Maidstone, Master at Paris

sophic ideas were ‘‘ puissantes comme critique, faibles comme systéme”’

  70 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
and Oxford, then Bishop and finally Friar, helped with his own 
hands to build the church in St. Ebbe’s, and his New Testament, 
bequeathed to the Minorites of Canterbury, is still to be seen in 
the British Museum. Hugh of Hertilpoll or Hartlepool was one 
of the two Proctors entrusted by Dervorguilla with the govern- 
ment of Balliol College. John Mardeslay later was a Friar and _ 
Doctor of Oxford who argued so skilfully against Papal exactions};\ 
as to win admiration from the Black Prince. Thomas Woodford * 
was known for his opposition to the Wycliffites, Nicholas Faken- 
ham for his criticism of the Princes of the Church. William 
Russell shocked fifteenth-century opinion by maintaining that a 
religious might enjoy the embraces of a woman without mortal 
sin, but brought down far sterner thunders by insisting that 
tithes ought to go to the poor instead of to the parish priest. 
And Henry Standish later still won fame by defending the Old 
Learning and by daring rashly to cross swords with Erasmus. 
Two more important names than these should appear among 
those of the Friars of Oxford. Two early Primates, Kilwardby 
and Patcham, exercised no small authority in the Oxford Schools. 
Robert Kilwardby, a Dominican, was the first Friar to win the _ 
highest honours in the Church of England. He became Arch- — 
bishop of Canterbury in 1272. Conspicuous as grammarian, 
logician, theologian, he made his influence felt in Oxford. The 
Oseney canons complained that he used it to exact exorbitant 
fees from them. Both Kilwardby and Patcham undertook to 
condemn erroneous teaching in the University—errors in grammar, 
logic and philosophy, of which the heresy that ego currit was 
good Latin seemed the most absurd. But there were graver 
errors than this among the opinions which the two important 
Visitations of 1277 and 1284 condemned, errors arising from the 
new Aristotelian teaching for which Aquinas was largely respon- 
sible and which the Dominicans were adopting as their own. 
Archbishop Patcham had a longer lease of power as Primate, 
and played a larger if not always a wiser part in political affairs. 
He had learned at Oxford not only science. and theology but 
poetry, it seems, and mathematics. He was all his life a staunch 
friend of the Franciscan Order. He clung to its ideals and its 
austerities. He could not bear to see it oppressed. And he 
was never backward to defend its opinions or to rebuke those of 
its Dominican rivals. But more important even than Patcham, 
  1“ This doctrine,” Dr. Rashdall adds, “‘ was of course a logical theory 
about the copula, not a piece of mere grammatical ignorance, as is sup- 
posed by Wood and others” (II, 425, n.). I think there is no doubt 
that Dr. Landry is right (Dums Scot., 39) in giving the date of Kilwardby’s 
Visitation and of the condemnation of the suspected doctrines as 18 March 
1277—not 1276—within a week or two of their condemnation in Paris. 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
THE FRIARS IN OXFORD GE 
the most popular of the Franciscan Doctors, the men who 
stirred the student world of Europe as no Oxford philosophers 
had stirred them yet, were John Duns Scotus, the “ Doctor 
Subtilis,’’ who was a Friar in St. Ebbe’s when the fourteenth 
century began, and William of Ockham, the ‘“‘ Doctor Invinci- 
bilis,’” who in his turn did something to sweep Duns’ ingenious 
intricacies away. Their influence on the University and the 
problems they debated form a separate chapter in the history 
of the Schools.t 
The Franciscans played a great part, none a greater, in 
Oxford life and Oxford thought. But other settlements of 
Friars followed where the disciples of Dominic and Francis 
led the way. About the middle of the thirteenth century the 
Carmelites or White Friars acquired a house in Stockwell Street.? 
There their white garments* soon became familiar. There or 
close by there King Edward II, in pursuance of a hasty vow 
made when flying from the field of Bannockburn, granted them 
the Royal Palace of Beaumont for their home. The name of 
Friars’ Entry near St. Mary Magdalen’s still recalls the gift. 
The Augustinians, very little later, obtained a grant of land 
and built a Convent just outside Smith Gate, where in the 
seventeenth century the courts and gardens of Wadham were 
to rise. The Schools of the Austin Friars took the lead in the 
teaching of grammar, and their name was long associated with 
the famous disputations for which their Schools were lent. 
Leland noted among their most eminent members Thomas 
Winterton, once ‘‘a great familiar’? of Wycliffe, John Cap- 
grave, the most learned of all Augustinians, and Thomas Pen- 
keth, who has a strong claim to immortality if it be true that 
he knew all the works of Duns Scotus off by heart. The Friars 
of the Penitence of Jesus Christ, more commonly known as 
Friars of the Sack, settled in the same period close by the 
Minorites, in St. Budoc’s parish. But before many years were

Mr. Little. 
2 Stock or Stoke, Mr. Hurst thinks, suggests a ford. The well was 
called Plato’s Well in Tudor days (Oxford Topography, 97-100). Grants 
of houses and lands to the Carmelites between 1317 and the end of 1324 
are recorded in the City Archives (Ogle, Royal Letters, 25-6 and 34). 
3 Their white habits, Leonard Hutten thought (Elizabethan Oxford, 
O.H.S., 80-1), were originally edged with red, in imitation of the garments 
of ‘‘ Elias the Prophett.”’ 
4 Friar Bastion, poet and warrior, the Prior of the Oxford House, hap- 
pened luckily to be at the King’s side (see Wood, City, II, 413-45, and 
Goldie, Bygone Oxford, 22-3). Edward also granted them 5 marks a 
year each for the sustenance of 24 Brethren, which were not punctually 
paid (Collect. III, 130).

over the Order was extinguished, and most of its property 
passed to the Grey Friars. Towards the end of the thirteenth 
century the Trinitarians were established by Edmund of Corn- 
wall in a House outside the East Gate And the Crutched 
Friars for a time, says Wood, found quarters in Grandpont 
towards the river, and afterwards near St. Peter’s in the East.? 
But none of these Orders enjoyed an influence comparable to 
that of the Franciscans or Dominicans either in the University 
or in the town. - 
It was perhaps inevitable that sooner or later difficulties 
between the Mendicant Orders and the University should arise. 
All friends and leaders of the Friars had not the authority of 
Grosseteste or the wise moderation of Adam Marsh. There was 
always a danger lest their duty to their Convents and their duty 
to the University should pull them different ways. And as 
the first, fine enthusiasm abated, critics of the new Evangelists 
had no hesitation in finding matter for complaint. In Paris 
the Friars made a determined effort to absorb the teaching of 
theology, while escaping from the University’s control. They 
secured the Pope’s assistance, and a long and memorable con- 
flict followed. But in Oxford the controversy took a milder 
form. The University ‘‘ founded in Arts” insisted that even 
theologians should first qualify in that subject. Bacon pro- 
tested against boys becoming Doctors of Theology before they 
had “learned anything of real value.” But the Dominicans 
and Franciscans were interested chiefly in theology and Canon 
Law. Their aim was to train men for pastoral work. Their 
greatest teachers had bidden them study the Bible, not the 
1 They had property later within the Gate, but were almost extin- 
guished by the plague in the middle of the fourteenth century. A Trinity 
Hall for poor scholars, says Wood, grew up on the site of some of their 
possessions, and William of Wykeham bought up others (City, II, 478-88). 
See also Hurst (Oxf. Topog. 146-7). But Mr. Salter points out that the 
town seized the property in the fourteenth century for non-payment of 
rent, and kept it till the end of the fifteenth, appointing priests to serve 
the Chapel (Mun. Civ. Oxon. xli, 19-20, 26-9 and 214). 
2In 1349 Richard Cary of Oxford had a license to alienate to the 
Crutched Friars by the Tower of London two messuages and a plot of 
land in Oxford, 30 ft. broad by 60 ft. long, valued at 2s. 6d. a year, to- 
wards the maintenance of 13 of the Order as Scholars in the University, 
and for the enlargement of their manse in that town (Cal. P. R., 1348-50, 
p. 291). Stevens (Additions to Dugdale, vol. I1) has little to add to our 
knowledge of the Oxford Friars. On the Crutched Friars, and on the 
hermit of Grandpont who guarded the South Bridge and other Oxford 
Bridge-Hermits, see Salter (Mun. Civ. Oxon. 117-19 and xlii-v). 
* The Cambridge Statutes of the fourteenth century show some appre- 
hension that Friars might fail in their duties as Regents and evade their 
academic oaths. (See Peacock’s Observations on the Cambridge Statutes, 
App. A., xliii, n.)

  THE FRIARS IN OXFORD 73 
Sentences of Peter Lombard or the dialectic of the Schools. 
Their rules forbade them to take an Arts degree. In 1253 
Thomas of York, a Franciscan Friar of high reputation, peti- 
tioned for leave to incept in theology, although he had not 
previously “ruled in Arts.’ The University was willing to 
grant a dispensation, to make a special case for Friar Thomas. 
But it held firmly to the principle laid down. Perhaps it already 
realised how important alike to discipline and to education it 
might prove. Adam Marsh protested: but even he was over- 
ruled. The Chancellor and Masters adhered to their Statutes, 
and kept the right to make exceptions in their own hands. 
There for the moment the controversy rested, but early in 
the fourteenth century it broke out afresh. The Dominicans, 
never backward in contention, became the protagonists in the 
new struggle. They charged the University with unfair dealing 
in a variety of ways. A single Regent Master could block the 
issue of the Graces or dispensations which alone enabled Friars 
to take theological degrees, and it was alleged that this power 
was frequently abused. The University had transferred to St. 
Mary’s the trial sermons and disputations on the eve of Incep- 
tion, which had previously been held at the Mendicants’ Con- 
vents or Schools : the latter were perhaps growing too important 
for the University’s peace of mind. The Friars were unreason- 
ably compelled to lecture on the Sentences, which involved 
some metaphysical and dialectical training, before they were 
permitted to lecture on the Bible. In the passing of Statutes 
insufficient deliberation was allowed. It had been ordered that 
any Statute carried by the Regent Masters in two Faculties, 
together with a majority of the Non-Regents, Masters who no 
longer taught, should be binding on the University as a whole : 
and Masters in Arts and in Medicine, if supported by the Non- 
Regents, could thus overbear the wishes of the theologians and 
Doctors of Law. It was intolerable that the ‘‘ supreme science,” 
theology, should have to submit to such dictation. It was 
flatly contrary to the practice at Paris; where a two-thirds 
majority of every Faculty was required to pass new Statutes.1 
The Friars were made to swear to all these objectionable regula- 
tions, and to vow never to oppose the University itself. One 
1The Bull Quasi lignum vite, granted by Alexander IV in 1255, and 
printed by Denifle (Chartulavium Univ. Paris. 1, 279-85) did not really 
go so far as the Oxford Friars alleged, but only made a two-thirds majority 
in each Faculty necessary to carry a decree of suspension of studies. But 
the Bull was meant to help the Friars, and to give them a veto on the 
use of that formidable weapon by the University. Dr. Rashdall thinks 
that both at Paris and at Oxford in the thirteenth century the practice 
was to require the consent of all four Faculties for a new statute, “ with 
the addition, in the case of Oxford, of the Non-Regents ”’ (II, 375).

Dominican Doctor at least had been excluded from Congregation 
for refusing to submit. Others had been excommunicated by 
the Archbishop of Canterbury .at the University’s request. 
The Friars’ students were being driven from their Schools. 
Their living, their good name, the affection of their friends, 
were being taken from them, A storm of obloquy had been 
aroused by the University’s “ exquisite and secret machina- 
tions.’’ These and other complaints composed a formidable 
indictment. When all allowance is made for medieval rhetoric, 
some of the grievances mentioned were, no doubt, deeply felt.1 
But the University was not prepared to give way. The 
Masters may have made mistakes, but. they were right on the 
main issues. They were fighting for the cause of education. 
They were defending the University’s authority against a powerful 
religious interest, which had already secured in Paris a privileged 
position for itself. The University’s answer justified its action. 
The Dominicans retorted with more detailed complaints. Their 
appeal to the Pope was read in the Minorite church “in the 
presence of a vast multitude of péople.’’ The Friars’ proctor, 
prevented from serving the notice of appeal on the Chancellor 
inside the Schools, waylaid him as he came out and thrust it 
into his bosom. The Chancellor with appropriate energy of 
language threw it in the mud. The undaunted proctor pro- 
ceeded to serve his notice on the Congregation in St. Mary’s, 
and when hustled out of church, mounted a tombstone and 
shouted it through an open window. The Masters’ servants, 
joining in with gusto, threatened to burn the saucy Friars with 
their buildings over their heads. “But the appeal nevertheless 
went on. The Masters complained of the malice which dragged 
them to remote tribunals, of the sinister influence which tainted 
at the source “ the rivers of favour flowing from the Apostolic 
Court.” They declared that the Friars used ‘oily words” to 
the Pope, but very different language-to themselves, that they 
stirred up the burgesses of Oxford, those “ satellites of Satan,” 
against the University, that they even proceeded to blows in — 
church, a crime naturally horrible to:scholars.?. Arbitrators 
were appointed finally to deal with the whole question, and 
1 The fullest statement of the controversy will be found in the Digby 
Roll in the Bodleian, printed and edited by Dr. Rashdall (Collect. I, 
193-273). See also, among other authorities, Cal. Cl. R. (1311, p. 445, 
and 1318, p. 535), Cal. Pap. Letters (II, 167), Rashdall’s Universities (II, 
378-86), Fletcher’s Black Friars in Oxford (8-11), and Little’s Grey Friars, 
passim. Edward II may have tried to be just to both sides. But he 
took up the Friars’ grievances and alarmed the University by threatening 
to overhaul their Statutes.

their award was confirmed by the King in 1314. On the chief 
issues the University won. Its Statutes were upheld. Its 
authority was strengthened. But on some points concessions 
to the Friars were made. Bachelors of Divinity, before taking 
their Doctor’s degree, were permitted to preach one sermon in 
the Dominican church. Any Master refusing the Grace which 
enabled a Friar to graduate in theology without first graduating 
in Arts, was required to prove to the Regents in theology that 
his objection was well founded and not due to malice alone. Full 
notice was to be given in future of the making of new Statutes. 
And Statutes were not to be deemed carried unless voted by 
a majority of Regents of three Faculties, instead of two, together ~ 
with a majority of Non-Regents. Of these three Faculties, 
however, the Faculty of Arts must always be one. 
With these provisions the Friars had to be content. But 
they did not cease to press their views, when opportunity 
offered, on Pope and King, and as the years went on their 
unpopularity in the University increased. In the general feud 
between Friars and Seculars, the University stood on the Secu- 
lars’ side, and the Convocations of Canterbury and York voted 
it support. In the particular matter of Graces for degrees, the- 
Friars were accused of abusing their influence with great persons 
to secure dispensations on easy terms. “‘ Letters of lords sealed 
with wax,” asking favours for the Friars, were looked on with 
little favour. The ‘‘ wax-doctors’’ found few defenders. Even 
Wycliffe wondered at the “ cursedness’’ which made a Mendi- 
cant, dead to the vanities of the world, try ‘“‘ to get him a cap 
of masterdom by praier of Lords.’ The Friars were accused 
of inveigling boys into their Order by wiles and presents, of 
carrying them off at the age of thirteen,? of teaching them to 
beg and waste their time. Their encroachments made them 
enemies.’ Their rivalries caused scandal. Their growing wealth 
forfeited respect. The parish clergy resented their activity as 
confessors, their rights of burial, their interference in parochial 
1 Besides Edward II they found other powerful supporters, especially 
Pope John XXII and King Richard II. King Richard’s Writ of 1379 
in their favour is printed by Mr. Salter (Med. Arch. I, 204-5). 
2 Richard Fitz-Ralph, Archbishop of Armagh, cited an instance of 
this in his speech at Avignon in 1357 (see Lechler’s John Wiclif and his 
Eng. Precursors, 1, 82; the date is wrongly given). A Statute of 1358 
refers to the subject (Mun. Acad., 205). The University forbade the 
Mendicant Orders to receive any student under 18. But in 1366, after 
the Pope’s intervention, this rule was annulled (Cal. Pap. Lett. IV, 52, 
and Collect, III, 139). 
3 The Archdeacon of Oxford in 1319 forbade them to give absolution 
to offenders excommunicated for attacks on clerks. (See Linc. Reg.

work. Vested interests resented their preaching against tithes. 
The ordinary clerk resented the superior sanctity they claimed. 
Before long the old story repeated itself again, and the suc- 
cessors of the noble-hearted zealots, whose gospel of self-sacrifice 
had won the heart of medieval England, found, as the monks 
had found before them, that they had outgrown their welcome 
from the world. 
But the great Mendicant teachers of the thirteenth century 
left their stamp on Oxford learning. Going down into the 
streets and market-places, to instruct others in the Christian 
creed, they were compelled also to instruct themselves. The 
systematic study of theology became for them a matter of supreme 
importance. And it was hardly less important to reconcile 
their theology with the teaching of the great philosopher whose 
logic filled the Schools, and whose authority rested on his appeal 
to the common-sense of mankind. It would not be easy to ex- 
aggerate the impression produced in thirteenth-century Europe 
by the discovery that Aristotle’s logic was only part of a larger 
philosophy hitherto unknown, and by the translations which 
made his writings on natural philosophy, metaphysics and ethics 
for the first time familiar to the Western world. It meant a 
new birth of science. It was the greatest event in the intel- 
lectual history of the age. The earliest Latin versions of the 
treatises on physical science were taken from the Arabic and 
reached Europe through Spain. It was Aristotle in an Eastern 
dress, as interpreted by Arabian commentators and medieval 
Jews. The influence of Avicenna, the brilliant Persian doctor, 
born before the tenth century closed, who knew the Koran by 
heart at ten and Aristotle’s Metaphysics a few years later, whose 
works on medicine held the field for centuries, and whose para- 
phrases of Aristotle served as text-books in the East, has been 
traced rightly or wrongly in every page of the writings of Albert 
the Great. The influence of Averroes, the great twelfth-century 
philosopher of Southern Spain, the Aristotelian commentator 
whose speculations alarmed the orthodox Moslems of his own 
century as much as the orthodox Christians of the next, is scarcely 
less noticeable in the philosophy of Aquinas.1_ But the Arabic 
texts were often translations from manuscripts in Syriac, which 
were themselves translations from the Greek, and it is no wonder 
if the Latin versions based upon them showed some confusion 
of language and of thought. “ For a translation to be true,” 
was Bacon’s caustic comment, “it is necessary that a translator 
1“ Albert doit tout & Avicenne; saint Thomas, comme philosophe, 
doit presque tout & Averroés’’ (Renan, Averrods et l’Averroisme, 187).

(Cambridge, I, 91 sq.).
-P-A-G-E-98

should know the language from which he is translating, the 
language into which he translates, and the science he wishes 
to translate.” + Obscurity was sure to follow from the col- 
laboration of a Spanish scholar who knew no Arabic with a 
Saracen or converted Jew who knew no Greek. And worse 
than obscurity were the perilous comments, the unorthodox 
and anti-Christian arguments, the denial of doctrines like the 
immortality of the soul, which Averroes and other Arabian 
scholars deduced too readily from the great Master’s text. 
For a time the new philosophy was gravely suspected in 
Western Europe. The Church and her leaders drew back in 
alarm. Papal Legates and University Doctors agreed to pro- 
scribe Aristotle’s Natural Philosophy. Lectures on the Meta- 
physics were forbidden in the Paris Schools. But the temptation 
to explore the new treasures, and the magic of the name behind 
them, proved too strong. It was too much to ask seekers after 
knowledge to reject a philosophy so far-ranging and complete, 
a system of science and ethics, of metaphysics and psychology, 
of government and conduct, in advance of anything yet known, 
and all bearing the imprint of the most venerated teacher of 
the past. The Schoolmen boldly plunged in to solve the prob- 
lem, to disentangle the Master they believed in from the dan- 
gerous glosses of the East. Alexander of Hales was one of the 
earliest of the great Franciscan teachers, an Englishman whose 
“irrefragable ’’ eloquence held for long the Paris Schools,? 
though Bacon thought his masterpiece ‘‘ heavier than a horse.’”’ 
He was the first theologian to give the new philosophy a welcome, 
even in its Arabian dress. Grosseteste and others laboured to 
secure new translations of Aristotle directly from the Greek. 
The Latin conquest of Constantinople made Greek sources 
more familiar, and versions independent of Arab translators 
gradually brought the Metaphysics, the De Anima, the Ethics 
and the Politics into use.? Before the middle of the century 
the alarm had died away. In 1254 the Paris Faculty of Arts 
prescribed as text-books nearly the whole range of Aristotle’s 
writings. His metaphysics and his natural philosophy were 
admitted to be “sound and useful doctrine.” Above all, the 
1 Brewer’s Preface to Bacon’s Opera Inedita (lix). But on Bacon’s 
contribution to the problem, and on the whole question of these Aristote- 
lian translations see Dr. Grabmann’s Forschungen tiber die Lateinischen 
Aristoteles-Ubersetzungen des XIII Jahrhunderts (Sect, III and passim).

78 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
famous Dominican Doctors, Albert the Great and Thomas 
Aquinas, set out to prove that, properly interpreted, Aristotle 
illumined and strengthened the teachings of the Faith, and 
triumphantly claimed the new philosophy as part of the 
recognised heritage of the Christian Church. 
While Alexander of Hales was lecturing in Paris, Albert 
the Great was studying at Cologne, and from the Dominican 
Convent in Cologne he brought to Paris an Italian pupil destined 
to be even more illustrious than himself. The street where 
Albert taught in Paris is known by his name yet. His twenty- 
one folio volumes remain to show his mastery of the learning 
of his time. The ‘“ Universal Doctor’? scorned no branch of 
knowledge. Physical science, botany, geography, astronomy, 
astrology, even alchemy and the forbidden arts, fell within the 
vast range of his studies. Architecture was not excluded, He 
has been credited with designing Cathedrals, and even with 
planning the first splendours of Cologne. Organ-building owed 
its development to his pupils if not to him. And his influence 
on Aristotelian study was profound. The “ Ape of Aristotle,’ 
as ungrateful critics called him, continued the method of para- 
phrase adopted by Avicenna. He was the first great School- 
man to endeavour to rearrange the Aristotelian philosophy so 
as to meet the requirements of the Christian Faith. But 
it fell to his celebrated colleague and disciple to build up the 
elaborate structure which was to reconcile philosophy with 
dogma, and to set Aristotle side by side with the Fathers of the 
Church. 
Thomas of Aquino has no place in Oxford history beyond 
the place he was to hold for generations wherever men and eager 
boys discussed the mysteries of belief. He was a Dominican 
whose authority the Oxford Franciscans were by no means too 
ready to accept. He was an Italian, trained at Cologne, whose 
teaching ultimately found its stronghold in Paris. The doc- 
trines which he deduced from Aristotle startled at first the more 
Conservative spirits of the day. And it took years before the 
“dumb ox” of the Cologne Convent was recognised, in the 
flowing metaphors of the Schoolmen, as the ‘“‘noble and 
illuminating candlestick,” the morning-star of the Universal 
Church. But no man’s name so filled the Schools. And no 
man organised and expounded so completely the accepted 
theology of the Middle Ages. In Pisa and in Florence altar- 
pieces represent the “ Angelic Doctor” in his glory, throned 
among prophets, evangelists, philosophers and saints. Sages 
like Plato and Aristotle attend him. Heretics like Arius, 
Sabellius, Averroes are seen crouching under foot. The pictures 
preserve the fixed tradition of St. Thomas’ service to the Church. 
 
-P-A-G-E-100

He took the two greatest reasoners of antiquity and established 
their philosophy in a definite place in the scheme of orthodox 
thought. He rescued Aristotle from the mists of error with 
which pagans or schismatics had surrounded him, from the 
perilous meanings which the unguarded student might read 
into his text. He reconstituted theology on an Aristotelian 
basis. He proved that Aristotle and Augustine were allies. 
He borrowed the exegetical methods of Averroes, and used his 
learning while rejecting his mistakes, He went out to meet the 
problems which doubt or scepticism suggested, and tried not 
to flinch from the difficulties involved. Like his master Albert, 
he was as ready to state the arguments against the Faith as he 
was to meet and to confute them. And his gift of luminous 
disputation, no doubt, increased the habit of debating, the 
tendency to lay stress on verbal argument and controversial 
methods, which even among the Schoolmen who preceded him 
was already marked enough. 
St. Thomas’ great work, the Swmuma Theologie, was con- 
ceived upon a noble scale.2 It aimed at building up a perfect 
system, unfolding all that knowledge had discovered of the 
1 Aquinas had almost all Aristotle’s works available in Latin trans- 
lations from the Greek. 
2 Dr. Harnack (Hist. of Dogma, tr., VI, 157-9, n.) gives a summary of 
it, which I may perhaps condense. The Summa consists of some hun- 
dreds of Questiones, divided into Articuli, which are subdivided further. 
The First Part treats of God and the issue of things from God, of the 
proofs of God’s existence, of His nature, His attributes, His will and His 
omnipotence, etc, It treats also of the Trinity and the Creation, of the 
origin of angels and of man, of the nature of the soul and the divine 
government of the world. The Second Part treats of general morality, 
founded on the Aristotelian ethics, of man’s end and will and freedom, 
of his passions, virtues and sins, of the meaning of law and of grace. 
And it goes on to discuss, in a second section, special morality, from the 
point of view of the return of the rational creature to God, the theological 
and cardinal and special virtues, the characteristics of the contemplative 
and of the active life. The Third Part treats of Christ and the Sacra- 
ments, dwells on the incarnation, the nature and the life of Our Lord, 
and goes on to discuss the doctrine and meaning of the Sacraments, 
through which men are incorporated into Christ. St. Thomas left the 
Third Part unfinished, and it was completed with notes based on the 
Sentences of Peter the Lombard. Each proposition, and the authorities 
for it and the objections to it, are fully discussed. The dominant thought 
of the whole elaborate system is that the soul has its origin in God and 
returns to Him through Christ. Mr. Seebohm (Oxford Reformers, 109) 
has criticised with less respect the “‘ brief compendium ”’ of 1150 folio 
pages, each containing 2,000 words, with its 43 propositions on the nature 
of God, its 15 propositions on the nature of angels, its 45 propositions 
on the nature of man, etc. A fairer estimate of St. Thomas’ work, and 
in particular of his important argument in the Contra Gentiles, will be 
found in Dr. Wicksteed’s Hibbert Lectures for 1916 on The Reactions 
between Dogma and Philosophy.

purpose and relationship of God and man. Over-subtle its 
reasoning might be, incomplete, elusive, credulous at times. 
But no one could question its monumental industry, its wide 
and generous learning, its impressive argument, its solid and 
aspiring thought. Aquinas started from two positions which 
all the orthodox world was anxious to accept. He was deeply 
convinced that religion was rational. He was no less deeply 
convinced that reason was divine. To show how the one sup- 
plemented and confirmed the other, was the greatest triumph 
that either theologian or philosopher could achieve. And in a 
rare degree St, Thomas was both. As a philosopher he set 
hardly any limit to the natural truths which reason might 
examine. As a theologian he recognised that there were mys- 
teries, like the Trinity and the Incarnation, which only faith 
could penetrate and which no human reasoning could compre- 
hend. Revelation flowed through the channels of authority, 
the Scriptures and the traditions of the Church. Reason flowed 
through the channels of philosophy, the thought and methods 
of Aristotle and Plato. But both reason and revelation had 
their source in God. The Summa Theologie was in fact the 
Summa Philosophie too. By either path the human mind 
might seek to scale the heights above. 
Under Aquinas the problems of the Schoolmen altered. 
The older controversies between Realists and Nominalists, and 
the familiar speculations in regard to Universals, though con- 
stantly recurring, became a less absorbing theme. St. Thomas 
was so moderate a Realist that he has even been called a 
Nominalist.1 New debates on the Principle of Individuation, 
on the Unity or Plurality of Forms in man, arose. Aquinas 
held that the individualising principle, that which made the 
individual, was found in matter, not in form. He insisted that 
there was but one form in man, one soul, the power to live and 
feel and think, which included every function that souls could 
fulfil. But these doctrines, though deduced by St. Thomas 
from Aristotle, and only intelligible to students of that Master, 
though they might not have proved fully acceptable to the 
Master himself, raised logical and theological difficulties at once. 
If individuality depended on matter, it might be extinguished by 
death. Moreover, angels were admittedly forms without matter, 
and on this theory their individuality disappeared. By his 
1 By M. Hauréau. Dr, Rashdall adds (I, 366): ‘‘ With Aquinas the 
reality of the Universal ante vem was acknowledged, but only as an idea 
in the Divine Mind: the Universal post vem was admitted to be an 
abstraction from the particulars; the Universal in ve became as with 
Aristotle, as with Gilbert de la Porrée in the preceding century, a Form _ 
inseparably immanent in Matter.”
-P-A-G-E-102
  THE FRIARS IN OXFORD 8r 
principle of individuation Aquinas endangered the whole system 
of the celestial hierarchy so dear to medieval belief.1 By his 
doctrine of the Unity of Form he embarrassed all who recognised 
with Aristotle the existence of separate forms or faculties or 
energies in the soul of man.? It has even been suspected that 
he embarrassed himself. Critics saw their opportunity. Bacon 
brushed the new ideas aside. Archbishop Patcham, with his 
strong Franciscan sympathies, denounced the “ profane novel- 
ties’ which the great Dominican had introduced.* Even Arch- 
bishop Kilwardby, himself a Dominican, frankly condemned 
the views of Aquinas.4 The Oxford Masters consented to this 
condemnation, and the Franciscan Schoolmen joined keenly 
in the strife. But the Angelic Doctor’s learning and piety 
triumphed, and up to the critical days of the Renaissance held 
the field. The fame of his great work, the staunch devotion 
of his Order, the belief that he had yoked philosophy for ever 
to the chariot of the Church, made him for posterity the most 
representative of the Schoolmen, the safest exponent of the 
Catholic creed. Not only Dominicans, but Cistercians, Augus- 
tinians and the clerks of the Sorbonne rallied to his support. 
Dante, speaking for medieval Christendom, placed him high 
in Paradise among the shining spirits of the blessed.5 Erasmus, 
1 The Celestial Hierarchy of the writer who so successfully borrowed 
the name of Dionysius the Areopagite—and whom French tradition 
ingeniously identified with St. Denys—had a profound influence on 
medieval thought from the days of Erigena to those of Colet. Both 
of those eminent men made translations or abstracts of it. 
2 On this subject see later (Chap. VI). 
* But in earlier days he had, apparently, defended the views of Aquinas 
in Paris. (See Art. on ‘‘ Peckham,”’ D.N.B.) 
* Kilwardby was responsible for their condemnation at Oxford in 
March 1277. (See F. Ehrle’s article in Archiv fiir Literatur-und-Kirchen- 
Geschichte des Mittelalters (V, 603-35).) 
5 Paradiso (Cant. X). But Averroes, to whom Aquinas owed so 
much, was left—in very good company—in hell (Inferno, Cant. IV). On 
Aquinas and his writings a large literature exists. His works have been 
often republished since the great Venetian edition of 1593 ; and in 1880, 
Pope Leo XIII, who proclaimed him “‘ the master and prince” of all 
Schoolmen, set on foot a new standard edition. Of the Summa Theologie 
or Theologica there are also several editions, notably one in four volumes 
in Migne (1845), one in five volumes published in Paris in 1887-9, and 
a careful translation by the English Dominicans lately. Among English 
books there are a full biography by Archbishop Vaughan (abridged by 
Canon Vaughan), short lives by P. Cavanagh, P. Conway and M. O’Kane, 
and volumes on St. Thomas’ teaching by J. M. Ashley, H. C. O’Neill, 
J. Rickaby and others. Among French writers M. Charles Jourdain has 
two volumes on St. Thomas’ philosophy, M. Hauréau two chapters in 
Pt. II of his Hist. de la Phil. Scol., and M. Crolet a study based on Stéckl’s 
work, Among German authorities the full studies by Frohschammer and

speaking for a very different generation, found him in his own 
field unsurpassed. And Oxford, while to some extent rejecting 
his authority, and choosing other leaders to bear her standard 
in speculation and debate, paid tribute to the commanding 
reputation which Aquinas had achieved.

CHAPTER IV 
THE EARLIEST COLLEGES—UNIVERSITY, BALLIOL 
AND MERTON: GLOUCESTER AND DURHAM 
ALLIOL, Merton, University divide the honour of ranking 
first among the Colleges of Oxford. Each has claims that 
are not to be despised. If the existence of a College dates 
from the establishment of its scholars by the bounty of their 
Founder in a common dwelling-place at Oxford, it seems that 
Balliol is entitled to precedence ; for the House of Balliol Scholars 
undoubtedly existed in June 1266. Statutes and charters followed 
later, but the life of the little community had begun.1 If, how- 
ever, the existence of a College is to be dated from the promulga- 
tion of its Statutes, from the organisation of a corporate society 
in the Founder’s scheme, Merton may claim that its Founder’s 
Statutes, first issued in 1264, mark the beginning of the regular 
Collegiate system in this country. But the College which Walter 
de Merton founded was at first an endowed House at Malden in 
Surrey, managing estates which were to support twenty students 
at Oxford or elsewhere. A House at Oxford was clearly pro- 
jected, but it is not so clear that it came into existence before 
the buildings in Merton Street arose. And it was not till 1274 
1“ Balliol,” says Dr. Rashdall (Universities, II, 473), “is thus dis- 
tinctly in actual fact the oldest of Oxford Colleges.’”” By 1266 it had, 
not improbably, been in existence for some years. (See later, pp. 97-8.) 
Dr. B. W. Henderson, in his history of Merton College (9 and 285-6), 
argues that Merton College was ‘‘ founded in Oxford in 1264.”’ It would, 
I think, be more exact to say that Walter de Merton intended in 1264 
to found a College in Oxford, and that his project, after several changes, 
was finally carried through by 1274. To dismiss Balliol as an almshouse, 
because it represents an older and simpler type of foundation than the 
Merton model, is surely to ignore the way in which the earliest Colleges 
came into existence, not at Balliol only but at Paris and elsewhere. (See 
Rashdall, I, 478 sg. and passim.) Walter de Merton’s plans began as 
early as 1262 (see later, pp. 113 sq.) : John Balliol’s, it seems, began still 
earlier. William of Durham’s bequest dates from 1249, but it was not 
used immediately to found a College, and his Scholars afterwards obscured 
their true origin by inventing fables about King Alfred. Balliol represents 
the oldest House of Scholars in Oxford whose existence can be proved 
and not merely conjectured. Merton represents the oldest corporation 
organised on what became the regular English collegiate system. Uni- 
versity represents the oldest benefaction out of which a College subse- 
quently grew. 
83  
-P-A-G-E-105
84 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
that the Founder completed its establishment in Oxford. Finally, 
if the existence of a College should be dated from the benefaction 
which supplied the funds appropriated later to its use, University 
College may trace back its origins to William of Durham, who 
died in 1249. He bequeathed to the University three hundred 
and ten marks, to be invested in rents for the maintenance of 
ten or more Masters at Oxford. But it is not certain that he 
intended his Masters to form a separate community. And iit 
was not till some thirty years later that the University established 
in a concrete form the little society out of which the College grew. 
It seems that Oxford students from the first adopted the 
genial custom of living together, of sharing expenses and arrang- 
ing for their maintenance in the Halls and Inns and Hostels 
which they hired. An unusually rich student might take a house 
for himself. An unusually poor one might take refuge in a soli- 
tary garret. But the common life and the common table were 
an early part of the system of the place. Scholars hard put to 
it to pay the cost of living saw no shame in accepting help from 
some rich man. Many a lad of promise owed to prelate or noble 
the training which gave him his first start in life. And the idea 
of providing on a permanent basis board and lodging for needy 
students was, no doubt, the primary motive out of which the 
College system sprang. Even before 1243 Alan Basset left 
money to support two Chaplains to pray for his soul, who were 
also to be students in the Oxford Schools.2 He probably attached 
less importance to the education of his Chaplains than to the 
safety of his soul, But William of Durham’s bequest a few years 
later had a more definite academic purpose and was on a larger 
scale. 
William of Durham was one of the famous Masters who left 
Paris in the troubles of 1229, and he may at some time after that 
have found his way to Oxford. He became Rector of Wear- 
mouth and prospered in the world. He is alleged, rightly or 
wrongly, to have been Archdeacon of Durham ? and Archbishop- 
elect of Rouen. Matthew Paris says that he ‘‘abounded in 
great revenues, but was gaping after greater’’ when he died. 
But we know nothing of his connection with Oxford or of the 
1 Charters, buildings, even permanent endowments, were not in the 
earliest days essential for starting a College, though, no doubt, the simplest 
College would cease if the funds which kept its students failed. 
2“ Or elsewhere’ (Twyne, MS. XII, 159). The trust, dating from 
1243, was vested in the Priory of Bicester. Alan Basset probably died 
in 1232. ars 
* Dr. Rashdall doubts this. We know very little for certain about 
William of Durham. Matthew Paris is the chief authority. But see . 
W. Smith’s Annals of University College (3-6), Rashdall (II, 469-70), 
and D.N.B.
-P-A-G-E-106
  THE EARLIEST COLLEGES 85 
reasons which led him to bequeath to the University money for 
the support of Masters there. The University authorities 
invested some of the money in houses in Oxford, chiefly in houses 
used by clerks because they yielded better profits. They bought 
two houses in Schools Street near St. Mary’s, on the ground where 
Brasenose College stands, one at the north-east corner, which 
became known as the University’s Hall, the other a little to 
the South of it, called then or soon afterwards Brazen Nose Hall. 
They bought also William of Drogheda’s old home on the North 
side of the High Street, and two houses on the South side further 
East. House property had its value in medieval Oxford, for 
the last of these investments seems to have paid eleven per cent. 
The rest of the money the University used with more freedom, 
“ needing it for itself and certain great men of the land.” William 
of Durham’s Chest was probably resorted to for loans, loans to 
students, even loans to politicians. When matters were looked 
into about 1280, it was found that no part of the money lent to 
De Montfort’s Barons had been restored. At that date, how- 
ever, the University took the matter up in earnest. An inquisi- 
tion into William of Durham’s bequest was held, and a Committee 
of Masters appointed by the University drew up a scheme for its 
management in future. The scheme which they framed may 
still be studied in the ancient manuscript in the Treasury of the 
College, and from that scheme the definite establishment of a 
community of scholars dates. 
University College was in a special sense the University’s 
creation. But in that respect it stood alone. Generally speak- 
ing, a College after the earliest days implied a company of scholars, 
living together in a common House,? governed by their own rules, 
1“ Aula Universitatis.’’ Wood (Colleges, 40) calls it Little Univer- 
sity Hall; and that name was given later both to this house and to 
another which became part of the College buildings in the High Street. 
The title Great University Hall was given to the College afterwards. 
The two purchases in Schools Street date from 1253 and 1262, and that 
of “‘ Drawda Hall” from 1255. The two houses on the South of High 
Street were bought about 1270, the main site of the College in or after 
1332. The foundation deeds and early leases can be seen in the College 
Treasury, some of them unhappily torn and stained, but some very well 
preserved. I have to thank Mr. A. B. Poynton, the Bursar, for his kind- 
ness in showing them to me. William Smith’s eleven volumes of MS. 
at University and twenty-eight volumes in the Library of the Society of 
Antiquaries are full of valuable material, and Mr. Carr’s history of 
University College deals very clearly with these early days. The College 
Register begins in 1509, but the Bursars’ accounts are almost complete 
from 1381 to 1597. 
® Domus or Auda is the word for the building, Collegium for the society 
which lived in it. A House of Scholars is the earliest description. Adam 
de Brome in 1324 first received a license to found a College (Oriel), and 
Robert of Eglesfield in 1341 a license for a Collegiate Hall (Queen’s),
-P-A-G-E-107
86 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
and supported by common endowments with which the University 
had no concern. The College buildings which gradually arose, 
at first on no fixed plan or principle, owed something, no doubt, 
to the monastic idea. But they resembled in many ways also 
the manor-house of medizval England,’ and from the first they 
developed on lines of their own. The buildings most needed 
were rooms for the scholars to live in, a Hall or Refectory for 
meals, a kitchen to prepare their food. The monastic dormitory 
and the closed monastic quadrangle were not, it seems, a part 
of the original design. But from the chamber-fellows of the 
Colleges the ‘‘chums”’ of later days descend, and from a very 
early date the method was adopted of setting apart corners for 
study in the chamber which two or three scholars shared. A 
place to worship in was wanted, and for this purpose a parish 
church was used, until the Colleges obtained permission to 
dedicate oratories or to build Chapels for themselves. Chests 
were set apart to hold the College manuscripts, until more space 
was required and College Libraries arose. A safe place to store 
the College records, its plate and its precious possessions might 
be furnished by building Treasuries, of which Merton’s was the 
first, or failing that, an upper room might serve the purpose. 
A gate-house, like the gate-house of an Abbey, grew up in its 
earliest form at Queen’s. A tower rising over the gate-way was 
a part of the great New College plan, and the tower generally 
supplied a muniment-room as well as a lodging for the Head of 
the College. William of Wykeham set the example of a complete 
and uniform quadrangle, with Chapel and Hall placed close 
together, and with bell-tower, cloister and garden complete. 
At New College the brew-house and bake-house were outside, 
adjoining. In several Oxford Colleges the kitchen stood apart. 
At Cambridge, kitchen, buttery and pantry.were often grouped 
together, following the fashion of a private house. 
Cambridge had other architectural features of its own. At 
Cambridge Common Rooms were established long before Oxford 
men had ceased to gather round the brasiers in their Halls, and 
to watch the smoke escaping through the louvres overhead. At 
Cambridge too a long gallery, borrowed from the medieval manor, 
was a favourite part of the design. And Cambridge, the first 
For these and other details see, among other volumes, Willis and Clark’s 
Architectural Hist. of Cambridge (Vol. I, Introduction, passim, and Vol. 
III, 247 sq. for the valuable essay on the component parts of a College), 
and Mr. Aymer Vallance’s Old Colleges of Oxford (especially the Intro- 
duction). Both are full of interest, though the views expressed are not 
necessarily final.

University to adopt the closed quadrangle,1 was the first also 
to adopt the three-sided court, open on one side to the air and 
sunshine, of which Trinity and New College were one day to give 
examples to the Oxford world. But it was only by degrees that 
these larger plans developed and that the statelier features of 
the Colleges grew up. The earliest buildings at Oxford, save 
for the noble Chapel at Merton,? were for the most part of a 
simple, unambitious kind. The earliest. Fellows at Balliol, 
Merton, University lived in detached blocks of plain, bare rooms. 
They were content with clay floors, unplastered walls and un- 
glazed windows. They must often have suffered severely from 
the cold. It was not till the time of the Tudors that wooden 
floors and panelled walls and plastered ceilings began to be a 
regular part of College life. It was not till the days of Elizabeth 
that fires became plentiful or bedding soft, that observers noted 
the increase of furniture and plate and hangings, “ the multitude 
of chimneys lately erected,” or pillows and bolsters coming into 
general use. It was not till much later, as men’s necessities 
developed and as the standard of ease and luxury advanced, 
that the Colleges of Oxford, with their wealth and splendour, 
and their rare inheritance of tranquillity and charm, became at 
least as famous for the comfort they embodied as for the ideals 
which their Founders had enshrined. 
The scheme adopted in 1280 for University College was, to 
begin with, on a very small scale.‘ The intention was to enlarge 
it as the available funds increased. Four Masters, well lettered 
and well conducted, fit to profit in Holy Church, and unable to 
live honourably in the state of Masters without some assistance, 
1It seems that the plans of Pembroke College and of Corpus Christi 
College at Cambridge anticipated by a few years William of Wykeham’s 
great design (Willis-Clark, III, 255-6). 
2 And, we should perhaps add, the Hall. 
3 But I am inclined to think that, at any rate in the later Middle Ages, 
fires in Oxford Colleges were less uncommon than has sometimes been 
supposed. 
4 William Smith in his Annals and Mr. Conybeare in his interesting 
article in the Colleges of Oxford (ed. by Dr. Clark) urge that before 1280 
some of William of Durham’s money may have been used to support 
scholars, and that these scholars may have lived in the houses bought 
by the University. Both conjectures are quite reasonable, only there is 
no evidence in support of either. The more natural inference from the 
deed of 1280 seems to be that the establishment of a community of 
scholars and the appropriation of moneys to its use began with the inquiry 
of that year. Smith pleads with force that a College is not necessarily 
a building of brick or stone. “ As soon as ever these Scholars amounted 
to the Number of three, they made as perfect a College as the Roman 
Tongue . . . could make them.’’ But there is no proof that before 1280 
William of Durham’s scholars did amount to three, or form any kind of 
separate society.

88 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
were to be chosen by the Chancellor and Masters in Divinity and 
certain others. They were to live together and study theology, 
and at least one of them was to be a priest. Each was to receive 
for maintenance fifty shillings yearly, more than the frugal 
scholars of Balliol were allowed. One of the four Scholars or 
Fellows—the terms were interchangeable—was to look after 
the rents and property of the small community, and to receive, 
if funds permitted, an additional five shillings a year. The first 
four were to have a voice in the election of other Fellows in 
future. But the University retained large powers of supervision, 
and could remove any Fellow or stop his allowance if necessity 
arose. Later on, in 1292, and again in 1311, other Statutes were 
issued, which entered into more detail.1 Further provision was 
made for the management of the College property, for an audit 
of its accounts and a register of its goods, for the payment of 
debts and the keeping down of expenses: the ordinary expenses 
of a Fellow were not to exceed twelve pence a week. In making 
up accounts “‘ all hatred, favour, prayer and price” were to be 
laid aside. The Senior Fellow was appointed to act as Head 
and was to serve as Chaplain. He and the Procurator or man 
of business, now described as the Bursar, was to draw a little 
additional pay. Every Fellow was to have, beyond his commons, 
half a mark yearly for room and service.2 But no Fellow was 
to keep to himself as much as ten shillings for more than a day. 
Stress was laid on the study of theology, but the Decretals might 
be read in the Long Vacation. Stress was also laid on character 
and poverty and on some connection with the neighbourhood 
of Durham. Scholars of William of Durham was to be the 
community’s name. 
Other provisions in these Statutes are worth noting. Fellows 
promoted to benefices worth five marks a year were to be replaced. 
Honest men, sojourners who were not members of the Society— 
the dim fore-runners of the Commoners of the future—were to 
be allowed, after a private enquiry into their characters, to come

vol. VII of his MSS. there (7-8). Wood translates part of it (Colleges, 
41): Conybeare, Carr and Rashdall give good accounts of it. Anstey 
prints it (Mun. Acad. 780 sq.) and also the Statutes of 1292 and 1311 
(56-61 and 87-91). Smith (MS. vol. VII) gives an account of all the 
Statutes to the end of the fifteenth century. They are not included in 
the collection of College Statutes published by the Commissioners in 
1853. The eighteenth-century Statutes were printed in 1855. 
2“ Pro servis et camera ’’ (1292), ‘‘ pro pensione domus et salario 
famulorum et aliis necessariis”’ (1311). The Head had an extra half- 
mark yearly, the Bursar an extra ten shillings. Nothing is said in the 
Statutes of 1292 or 1311 about the yearly fifty shillings, which probably 
went for commons,

in and board. A Library was established, with careful regula- 
tions for books taken out. In the College accounts for 1391-2 
there is a significant entry—“ paid a certain Friar for bringing 
back a book to the College 18d.’”"—which looks as if the sense of 
literary property had sometimes to be stimulated in material 
ways. Latin was to be spoken often.1 Mutual respect and 
civility were enjoined. Fighting and bad language were for- 
bidden ; loose songs and tales and fables about love were dis- 
approved. Fines were imposed on Scholars who spoke evil of 
each other, rising in amount with the degree of publicity given 
to the offence. But even in these later Statutes the control of 
the University was strongly emphasised. It was long before the 
little College secured its independence. It was some years before 
it obtained a seal of its own. And it was not till 1336 or later 
that it found a permanent home on the South side of the High 
Street,? where houses had been gradually acquired, and where 
now, in place of humble timber dwellings, roofed with thatch 
and repaired with moss, red earth and straw,* a stately front 
and dignified quadrangles support its venerable fame. 
A stranger incident in the history of the College is its per- 
sistent effort to prove that William of Durham was not its 
Founder. The records of the medieval Church are full of forgery, 
and the muniment rooms of Oxford have their share. But there 
are few examples of fraud so transparent and triumphant as the 
attempt of William of Durham’s Scholars to set up King Alfred 
in his place. The legend which some audacious spirit of the 
fourteenth century probably invented in the interests of a College 
lawsuit, was taken up by successive generations imperfectly 
equipped with the historic sense. Ingenious forgeries were con- 
cocted to maintain it, among others a plausible little document 
dated 1220, which mentioned the Great Hall of the University 
as existing a generation before William of Durham died. The 
Chancellcr’s seal was borrowed or stolen to support it. Twyne 
1“ Sepe ”’ (Mun, Ac. 60)—a rather weak stipulation. 
2 Spicer’s Hall in St. Mary’s parish was bought in 1332, and Lodelowe 
Hall and others close by a little later. It is uncertain where the Masters 
chosen in 1280 were housed. There is no evidence that they lived in 
the corner-house in Schools Street bought by the University in 1253. 
The rents of that Hall may have been needed for their support, and the 
fact that they finally settled in the High Street does not suggest that the 
Hall in Schools Street was regarded as their home. But that arrangement 
would of course have been natural enough, and failing any other it seems 
probable,

Mr. Riley in the Fifth Report of the Hist. MSS.Commission (477-8) and by

wine and gloves for visitors, for trees for the garden, and the like.

thought that a deed.so solemnly vouched for could not lie. But 
William Smith with searching candour retorted that, “if ever 
there was a lie in the world, the devil never told a greater.”1 
Pictures of Alfred as Founder appeared in the College windows. 
A statue of the King was set up over the gate. Wood relates 
that the word “ Fundatoris’’ was actually obliterated in one 
window from a scroll attached to William of Durham’s arms. 
The old prayer recited in the College Chapel was altered, so as 
to make King Alfred Founder of the College, instead of only 
Founder of the University as before, and a seventeenth-century 
Master, more honest than his colleagues; was moved to cry out, 
in the middle of the service, his protest at the fraud. A still 
bolder flight of falsehood discovered that Bede and St. John of 
Beverley had. been Scholars of the College long before King 
Alfred’s day, and new pictures were forthcoming to corroborate 
this plea. But careless ‘of such, contradictions the myth about 
Alfred lived on, / Eighteenth-century lawyers argued with in- 
verted piety that it-would never do to throw over a fable so 
long consecrated by the College prayers. ““‘ That a succession 
of Clergymen for so many years should return thanks for an Idol 
or mere Nothing, in Ridicule and Banter of God and Religion, 
must not be suffered in a Court of Justice.” And the climax 
was reached when, in 1727, in the course of a quarrel over 
the Mastership and the Chancellor's right of visitation, the 
Judges of the King’s Bench solemnly decided that the founda- 
tion of the College ae King Alfred was recognised by English 
law.? 
Advantages more and, traditions better worth recording, 
followed when the little College had been set upon its feet. More 
houses in Oxford were purchased, including the ‘‘ Cok on the 
Hoop”’ at the corner of Logic Lane. Gifts of money began to 
flow in. In 1418 the College income apparently amounted to 
fifty-six pounds, six shillings and tenpence all told. About the 
end of the fourteenth century the number of Fellows was in-

for a fifteenth-century lawsuit, not for the earlier one. For the Petition 
of 1379 from the Master and Scholars of “ Mokel Universite Halle,” 
which was “first founded by King Alfred for the support of twenty-six 
perpetual divines,” see Collectanea (III, 143-4, and the authorities there 
cited). 
2The Times of June 14, 1872, gives an account of the absurd but 
amusing “‘Millenary” dinner, at which Dean Stanley spoke his mind 
upon the subject, and for which Professor Freeman offered to contribute 
some of Alfred’s celebrated cakes. See also, Conybeare (Colls. of Oxford,

  THE EARLIEST COLLEGES or 
creased.1 Three new Fellowships were founded by Walter Skir- 
law, Bishop of Durham, who as a boy, “‘ being very untoward,” 
was said to have run away to the University from home.? Forty 
years later the Earl of Northumberland founded three others.’ 
One great lady left the College a “notable sum of gold and 
silver.” Another great lady and a Cardinal left more. An 
Oxford citizen or his widow gave in Elizabethan days lands and 
tenements and pastures, to support two lecturers in philosophy 
and logic, and to increaSe the diet of the Fellows. This was the 
first provision for any teaching staff. In the same reign the 
superb and notorious Earl of Leicester settled the nomination 
to two new Scholarships upon his second wife; Oxford men 
were probably more deeply interested in his dealings with his 
first. In the seventeenth century bequests, which helped to 
pay for the new buildings, came from Charles Greenwood, a 
famous College tutor, and from Sir Simon Bennet a wealthy, 
childless Baronet, who founded new Fellowships and Scholar- 
ships as well. Greenwood had the distinction of winning a warm 
testimonial from a celebrated man. ‘I protest to God,” wrote 
Strafford to his nephew, “ were I in your place I would think 
him the greatest; and best riches, I could or would possess.” 
Tutors like Greenwood spared no pains to look after their pupils, 
to regulate even their pocket-money, their medicines and their 
clothes. Towards the end of the century, Dr. Radcliffe, the 
bluff and uncourtly physician who is reputed to have told William 
III that he would not have his Majesty’s two legs for his three 
kingdoms, proved for many years another generous friend to 
the College.* 
It was not long before the’Scholars of William of Durham, 
or, as they preferred to be styled when disavowing their Founder, 
the Scholars of Great or Mickle University Hall,> won honours 
and distinctions in the world. The earliest Heads, the Senior 
Fellow acting, were not for the most part known to fame. But 
1 From 4 to 6 (Fifth Report Hist. MSS. Comm., 478). But in some 
of the early years they sank to 3, who may have had perhaps half a dozen 
other students lodging with them. 
2 These took effect in 1404 (Carr, 58). 
8 The Earl’s gift of the Rectory of Arncliffe in Craven to University 
College, ‘‘ our eldest daughter,” was acknowledged by the University in 
an elaborate letter in 1443 (Epist. Acad. 220-1). 
«Mr. Carr gives the fullest account of these and other bequests. 
Details, some of which may require corroboration, are also given by 
Wood (Colleges, 42 and 46 sq.), Ingram (Memorials of Oxford, Vol. I) and 
Chalmers (Hist. of Univ. of Oxford, I, 23-42). Let me add that I am again 
and again indebted to Mr. Qarr’s book and to his kind help. , 
5 A charter from Queen Elizabeth definitely incorporated “ the Master 
and Fellows of the College of the Great Hall of the University of Oxford ” 
—its legal title still (Carr, 89). 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
gz A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Edmund Lacy, who was Master about 1398, became Bishop of 
Hereford and Exeter, and was with Henry V in the Agincourt 
campaign. Wood generously credits the College with four 
Bishops of Durham, two of Lincoln and one of London in the 
fifteenth century alone.t On the other hand, the College pro- 
duced supporters of Wycliffe and opponents of Archbishop 
Arundel, “‘ degenerate sons and abortives,’’ who in 1411 brought 
down excommunication on their heads. Fifteenth-century 
Masters indulged in litigation which the little College could ill 
afford. Revenues were scanty. Religious laxity crept in. 
Bachelors as well as Masters were admitted. Young Commoners 
appeared.? Disputes occurred over elections to the Headship, 
and under Statutes made in Edward IV’s day the Senior Fellow 
ceased to succeed as a matter of right. Ralph Hamsterley, 
elected from outside in 1509, enjoyed no quiet tenure. But he 
started the College Register and he completed the first tower. 
His successor, Leonard Hutchinson, survived all political changes 
until 1546, when John Crayford, once Master of Clare Hall at 
Cambridge, and a ‘‘ better gladiator than Vice-Chancellor there,” 
imported rough and bustling manners naturally strange to Oxford 
men. The Reformation, however, left the College comparatively 
undisturbed, and the adherents of the old faith long retained 
their influence in it. Ridley declined a Scholarship in 1524. 
Cranmer had a friend there later, William Holcot, who carried 
a book to him ‘‘in his naughtiness’” in Bocardo. Thomas 
Caius or Keys, the irrepressible champion of the antiquity 
of Oxford, was elected Master in 1561,/in spite of his rather 
stormy University career. But, scholar as he was, he proved 
a far from competent administrator, and his successor, William 
James, had a hard task to restore the prosperity of the 
College. 
Shortly before the end of the sixteenth century a more 
celebrated person, George Abbot of Balliol, began to rule in 
University College and to exercise great influence in the Univer- 
sity at large. Clarendon complains of Abbot’s “ very sour 
aspect.” He had little sympathy with his Puritan views. But 
Aubrey declared that everyone who knew George Abbot loved 
him, and at Oxford Abbot was widely respected as one of the 
leaders of Calvinist opinion. The College prospered under his 
1 But Wood needs corroboration here. The grounds also for con- 
necting Fitz-Ralph, Archbishop of Armagh, with University College are 
very slender, and the grounds for connecting Shirwood and Baconthorpe 
with it are more slender still, though Mr. Carr loyally gives the traditions 
what support he can (52 and 54). 
2“ Boys ” are mentioned in the Bursar’s roll for 1441-2. Hitherto, 
it seems, the Commensales had been generally Masters,
-P-A-G-E-116
THE EARLIEST COLLEGES 93 
rule.t He had no indulgence for defaulting Bursars. He waged 
war against drinking, long hair and other vices in the under- 
graduate world. Abbot was made Archbishop of Canterbury 
by James I, and John Bancroft, who followed him, passed on 
in his turn to a Bishopric, and built Cuddesdon Palace for the 
glory and embarrassment of his successors. The Calvinistic 
movement was losing ground, and Thomas Walker, a connection 
of Laud’s, became Master in 1632. Walker’s reign saw many 
vicissitudes. Charles I visited the College in his splendour, 
and ten shillings had to be spent on whitewash for the Hall. 
A few years later, in his hour of need, he was appealing for the 
College plate.* In the Civil War University men served on the 
King’s side, and worked upon the Oxford earthworks with the 
rest. The College maintained twenty-eight Royalist troopers 
for some months. But it was represented also among the 
Parliamentary forces. Henry Martin, Member of the Long 
Parliament and Governor of Reading, had a gift of repartee which 
almost atoned for the fact that he was as “far from a Puritane 
as light from darknesse.’’ Though numbers fell, the life of the 
little Society continued, and it seems even to have succeeded in 
getting in its rents. In 1648 the Royalists suffered under the 
Parliamentary Commission. Thomas Walker, his namesake 
Obadiah, and other Fellows were expelled.? Joshua Hoyle was 
appointed Master, and was followed by a Chaplain of Cromwell’s. 
But the Restoration brought Thomas Walker back, and to in- 
1If Twyne’s figures are accurate, the College numbers had risen to 
72 by 1612, including 9 Fellows, 36 Commoners and 26 Poor Scholars, 
servitors and servants (MS. XXI, 514). 
2 It seems that in July 1642 the College pawned most of its plate 
and sent the money to the King. The rest was concealed when the 
Parliamentary troops arrived, and when discovered was confiscated by 
Lord Saye. Mr. Carr (107-8) thinks that the pawned plate was after- 
wards redeemed, and handed over to the Royal Mint in Oxford in January 
1643, like that of other Colleges. 
3“ The Master, five Fellows, seven scholars, the Butler, and two 
others, probably commoners, were expelled between July 8 and October 
17, 1648,” says Mr. Carr (115). Prof. Montagu Burrows (Register of 
Visitors of the University of Oxford, 555-6) gives the names of 13 members 
of the College, including Fellows, Scholars and servants, as expelled by 
the Parliament, and of some half-dozen who submitted. But the expul- 
sions were not always final, and it is not easy to be quite sure of the 
facts. The answers given by members of the College, dated May 18, 
1648, show 5 out of 9 submitting. In a list of July 7 of that year 3 are 
mentioned as deprived. Burrows gives a rather long list of new Fellows 
and Scholars appointed under the Commonwealth, and several references 
to the College debts. (See Register, passim, and especially 102-3, 135, 
145, 163, 173-4, 199, 269, 302, 386-8, and 555-8.) Langbaine’s tract of 
1651 (Foundation of the Universitie of Oxford) puts the College numbers, 
servants included, at 73.

crease his inadequate income the restored Master found it neces- 
sary to take a second wife.1_ The next Master, Richard Clayton, 
is dismissed by Wood as “‘ good for nothing but eating and 
drinking ”’ : the manners of the Restoration told. But the College 
at any rate did better, and the work of rebuilding went on. 
Obadiah Walker, a man of piety and learning, proved a successful 
begging-letter writer, and deserved his election to the Headship 
in 1676. He soon showed that he deserved also the suspicions 
cast upon his orthodoxy, and the accession of James IT permitted 
him to confess his long-cherished sympathy with his new 
Sovereign’s faith. Yet even after misfortune overtook him, 
Walker seems to have retained his friends. One famous pupil 
at any rate, whom he had tried to convert,? but who proved to 
have ‘“‘no relish for absurdities,” set up a simple and kindly 
inscription over his grave: 
SOW. 
Per bonam famam et infamiam.” 
Charlett, whose troubled rule ushered in the eighteenth century, 
was less successful in his dealings with the Fellows. But the 
failings and glories of that hospitable century, when Dr. John- 
son succumbed to the charm of the Common Room, belong to 
the history of a later day.® 
The College records tell of other worthies. Walter Hunger- 
ford fought at Agincourt. Robert Hungerford died for the Red 
Rose. Richard Fleming, once suspected of some sympathy with 
Wycliffe, lived to found Lincoln College as a stronghold of 
orthodoxy in 1427. John Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester, was a 
pioneer of the Renaissance both in learning and in crime.t Among 
prelates, Tobie Matthew, after playing many parts in Oxford, 
rose to be Archbishop of York, and Henry Ussher, less famous 
than James Ussher, who succeeded to the same post later, to 
be Archbishop of Armagh. Lord Herbert of Cherbury, most 
versatile of courtiers, spent four years at Oxford, as bachelor 
and husband, before he was nineteen, and decided that even at 
that tender age a man might soon have enough of philosophy and 
logic. Dudley Digges, once the colleague of Eliot, found it 
1“ For livelyhood only,” says Wood with needless candour. Three of 
the ejected Fellows, Obadiah Walker, Thomas Radcliffe and Abraham 
Woodhead, returned. The last was probably a Romanist already (Carr, 
122 and 132). 
2Dr. John Radcliffe (Carr, 152). 
8 T have explained in the Preface my reasons for bringing the sketches 
of College history in these early chapters down to the time of the English 
Revolution.

sity College. He was previously regarded as a Balliol man.

possible to serve under Somerset and Buckingham and Charles. 
Cavaliers commanded regiments for the King: Washingtons 
were found on both sides in the Civil War. Ezreel Tonge, the 
first Fellow put in by the Parliament, had his full share of the 
turbulent spirit of the time. Robert Morison, the first Professor 
of Botany, appointed in December 1669, “translated himself 
to the Physic Garden ; where he read in the middle of it (with a 
Table before him) on herbs and plants thrice a week for five weeks 
space.” John Russell, a young man of fashion, was sent down 
by Obadiah Walker, because his conversation damaged other 
young gentlemen in the College. Abraham Woodhead, who 
tutored and perhaps perverted Walker, was “the most in- 
genious and solid of the whole Roman party.’ Edward 
Hales, one of Walker’s converts, thanked James II for his 
toleration, and died for him at the battle of the Boyne. John 
Potter, destined to be Primate, came up as a servitor in 
1688. Carte wrote the life of Ormonde, the last great noble 
of a heroic age. 
The College buildings are themselves memorials to many 
more. In course of time the old thatched houses in or near the 
High Street were pulled down and replaced by an irregular 
quadrangle. Spicer’s Hall, the first house in St. Mary’s Parish, 
stood near the present Western gate. Rose Hall and White Hall 
were in Kibald Street behind ; their gardens probably ran back 
to the garden of Spicer’s Hall. Lodelowe Hall in High Street, 
East of Spicer’s, was bought in 1336, but was not included in the 
College till more than half a century later. Further East, Little 
University Hall and the Cok on the Hoop, purchased at the 
beginning of the fifteenth century, carried the College property 
to Logic Lane.1_ The old houses supplied rooms for students,” 
a dining-hall and probably a storing-place for books. The 
earliest students worshipped in the parish church.? But in 1369 
the Bishop gave a license for an Oratory or Chapel in the College, 
and some thirty years later the first Chapel was built. In the 
years which followed, a new quadrangle gradually grew up. 
About 1450 a new Hall or dining-room on the East side of it 
was built. Within the next quarter of a century the main 
gateway in the High Street, with a solid tower over it, 
1Then called ‘‘ Penkerychese lane alias Horsmyllane” (Carr, 59). 
In Grove Place a relic of Kibald Street survives (Salter, Names of Oxford 
Streets, 19).

8 St. Peter’s or St. Mary’s, but I have not been able to make certain 
which. The boundary between the two parishes runs almost through the 
present Western gate. Wood’s map of the ancient Oxford Halls, which 
Dr. Rashdall reproduces, is not exact.  
-P-A-G-E-119
  96 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
arose.1 The Chapel was enlarged and reconstructed. The 
Library was on an upper floor beside it. The newer buildings 
contrasted with the old. The ancient glass in the windows 
showed figures of St. Cuthbert, of William of Durham and of 
King Alfred—the monarch as usual busily engaged in falsifying 
the history of the College. The sixteenth century, it seems, saw 
Little University Hall definitely appropriated as the Master’s 
Lodgings,? and under Queen Elizabeth, when comfort was 
increasing, we hear of the Master’s furniture, of wainscoting and 
hangings, of damask and green and red “ saye.’’3 
But in the seventeenth century and the years which followed, 
the College was rebuilt upon a larger plan. In 1634 a new 
quadrangle, rendered possible by the generosity of Mr. Green- 
wood and Sir Simon Bennet, was begun. A new West side was 
followed by a new gateway and frontage to the street. The 
form of the new tower was, no doubt, influenced by the strong, 
broad, battlemented tower of earlier days. On the South side 
and facing the main entrance a new Chapel and Hall rose more 
slowly, interrupted for some years by “‘ civil distractions,’ but 
completed when the Restoration brought Church and King into 
their own again.’ The open timber roof of the Hall has since 
been covered with a plaster ceiling, and a chimney has replaced 
the louvre which once carried off the smoke. For the Chapel 
windows fine glass was available, “ exquisitely painted with 
scripture story ’’ by Abraham Van Linge, which Obadiah Walker 
is said to have secured over twenty years before,* and which still 
1 The tower, it seems, was not completed till early in the sixteenth 
century. The Master presumably lived there till 1531: but the matter 
is not very clear. 
2In 1531 (Carr, 79). But Mr. Carr suggests (63) that the Master 
may possibly have lived there earlier, before the tower was built. 
* Hist. MSS. Commission, Fifth Report (478). 
4 Many details of the expenditure, kept by Thomas Walker, are still 
in the muniment-room. The West side, with the return on the North, 
cost £1,405. The North side, with the return on the East, cost £1,651. 
The South side was more costly. The walls were for the most part 34 ft. 
thick. The large quadrangle was designed to be too ft. square. The 
smaller quadrangle, 80 ft. square, was added in the eighteenth century. 
(See the tenth chapter of Mr. Carr’s history.) 
5 The Hall was finished some years before the Chapel, the money for 
the purpose being raised in 1657. 
® See the receipt for part payment in May 1642, quoted by Mr. Carr 
(210 n.). Finished in 1641, all the windows except one are signed and 
dated. The East window, by Henry Giles of York, dated from 1687 
(Drake, History of English Glass-painting, 91). Mr, Westlake (Hist. of 
Design in Painted Glass, IV, 67-8) thinks that the windows at University 
represent the later Van Linge’s work in a perfect state. Bernard and 
Abraham Van Linge have left fine glass also at Wadham, Christ Church, 
Queen’s, Balliol, and possibly at Lincoln College. Most of it probably

lends its splendour to the College. Rich carving and panelling 
were added later, and Dr. Radcliffe provided an East window 
of fine English work. A high-roofed Library at right-angles 
to the Chapel, long reserved for graduates only, formed part of 
the seventeenth-century design. But in the nineteenth-century 
changes, which also transformed the Chapel and swept away 
the ornament upon the Southern front, this Library was destined 
to be superseded by another, and to descend to the level of a 
“kitchen stair.” Bancroft and Thomas Walker presented many 
of its manuscripts. A twelfth-century life of St. Cuthbert, a 
Latin Grammar of an earlier date, and a printed copy of St. 
Augustine’s De Civitate Dei, as old as 1473, are still among the 
Library treasures, while several Romanist publications recall 
Obadiah Walker’s rule. A Common Room for Fellows seems 
to have been established soon after the Restoration. The East 
side of the quadrangle was the last to be finished. It required 
a special appeal for subscriptions to “ gentlemen in the North 
Parts.” Their ‘‘aged mother... at this present time DCCC 
years old’? appealed with pathetic inaccuracy to former pupils 
to ‘‘ Repair her Ruins and Renew with great Augmentation her 
former glory:’’ and the Northern gentlemen were suitably 
impressed. The College arose from all its distractions far more 
spacious and imposing than before, and its time-worn buildings 
with their long line of frontage and their massive towers have 
since formed part of innumerable pictures of 
“The stream-like wanderings of that glorious street.” 
While the University authorities were dealing in no spirit 
of narrow precision with the trust funds bequeathed to them 
by William of Durham, John Balliol of Barnard Castle, husband 
of a Scottish Princess and father of a luckless Scottish King, was 
setting up a House for his Scholars in Oxford. John Balliol was 
one of the most powerful and wealthy Barons of the North. 
Old chroniclers represent him as a grasping, overbearing neigh- 
bour. But his wife so loved him that she kept his heart beside 
her in a precious casket after death, and in the Abbey of the 
Sweet Heart, where she was buried, she bade her descendants 
lay it upon her own.t Some time before the end of 1260, and 
is Abraham’s work, but Bernard’s window at Wadham is the earliest 
and on the whole the finest. Mr. C. H. Grinling’s paper in the Proceed- 
ings of the Oxford Architectural and Historical Society (New Series, IV, 
III sg.) gives a valuable account of the Van Linges and of the Ancient 
Stained Glass in Oxford. Giles’ window, largely perished, is said to exist 
still in the College cellars. 
1 The story of the Abbey and some of the traditions about its Foun- 
dress are given in Mr. W, Huyshe’s little book on Dervorgilla, Lady of 
Galloway.

  98 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
not improbably in 1255, John Balliol was induced to do penance 
at the Church door of Durham for his sins. He submitted to a 
public scourging and “assigned a sum of fixed maintenance? 
for scholars studying at Oxford, to be continued for ever.”” We 
know that there were already Scotsmen at Oxford—tales of 
poaching and rioting are mentioned—and that there had been 
Scotsmen or North Countrymen, with a young Balliol among 
them, concerned in 1238 in the Oseney affray.2 Even in his 
moment of humiliation John Balliol may have drawn comfort 
from the irrepressible independence of the race. At any rate 
in the years that followed his penance, some time between 1255 
and 1266, he established his society of Scholars in Oxford, on 
the example of the early Colleges abroad, and with the thrift 
which Scotland never undervalues allowed them each for their 
common table eightpence a week. In June 1266 a King’s writ 
spoke of the Scholars whom Balliol maintained at Oxford, and 
authorised the Mayor and Bailiffs to pay him twenty pounds 
for their use.4 The House of Balliol outside the North Gate, 
in St. Mary Magdalen’s parish, had already found a place in 
Oxford life. It continued to draw its exiguous revenues while 
its turbulent Founder lived. And his widow, ever reminded of 
his presence by the ivory casket ‘ bound with silver bright,” 
proceeded to organise on a more elaborate system the little 
community which bore his name. 
Dervorguilla of Galloway stands beside her husband as 
Foundress of the famous Scottish House. Her piety was perhaps 
less due to compulsion or remorse. Her pedigree—she descended 
from the old Royal line of Scotland—was more illustrious than 
his. Her features, fine for all their quaint rigidity, are stamped 
on her seal.5 A great lady and a great heiress—one of her homes 
1‘ Summam certe sustentationis.” The Chronicon de Lanercost (ed. 
Stevenson, 69) gives the story when speaking of the Bishop of Durham’s 
death in 1260, but does not assign it to that year. The incident may 
have occurred in 1255, the year from which Matthew Paris dates Balliol’s 
reconciliation with the Bishop and the end of many controversies between 
them (Chron, Maj,, V, 528).

man’s Rerum Anglicarum Scriptorum, I, 241) gives details under 1269, 
the year of Balliol’s death. It adds, curiously enough, that another 
House of Scholars existed at Oxford, who received twelvepence a week, 
given by the Bishop of Bath—presumably at the time when the chronicler 
wrote. Dr. Rashdall (II, 759) thinks this refers to Burnel’s Inn, which 
Bishop Burnel of Bath may have supported.

was at Fotheringay, where a still greater Scottish lady was to 
die—her charities and foundations were widespread. On Balliol’s 
death in 1269 she took over the maintenance of his students. 
She consulted advisers, both religious and secular, among whom 
two Franciscan Friars, Hugh de Hertilpoll and Richard de 
Slikeburne, are prominently named.t_ And in 1282, “‘ desiring 
with a mother’s affection to provide for the well-being * of our 
sons and Scholars dwelling in Oxford,’ she issued Statutes for 
them, delicately written on a single sheet of parchment, which 
can be read in the College Archives to-day. These Statutes, 
it seems, owed nothing to Walter de Merton’s example, but 
embodied customs which existed already in John Balliol’s House, 
and which probably drew their origin from the earliest Colleges 
in Paris. They required the Scholars of Balliol to attend services 
on Sundays and Schools during the week, to celebrate masses 
for their Founders, to say grace before and after meals. They 
bound them to obey the Proctors appointed by the Foundress 
in all matters that were known to concern their order and well- 
being. But they allowed them to elect their own Principal and 
to follow customs approved by themselves. The Proctors were 
to sanction the appointment of the Principal and to invest him 
with his office. They were made specially responsible for the 
finances of the needier Scholars, who were not to be called upon 
for any heavy payment if a deficit occurred in the common 
accounts *; and they were given large powers of discipline for 
their protection. The richer students were enjoined to live 
temperately, so that the poorer should not be overburdened 
with expense. It is not perhaps unreasonable to attribute to 
Franciscan influence this special consideration. for the needs 
and feelings of the poor. What was left over at meals was to 
be saved every day for one poor Scholar whom the Proctors 
appointed. Latin was to be spoken at the common table: 
those who would not speak it were to be served apart after the 
others, and if they proved incorrigible expelled. Careful rules 
were made for disputations. The Scholars, though from the 
first closely connected with the Grey Friars of Oxford, were not 
intended to be theologians. They were students of Arts and 
in principle an undergraduate community.‘ The Proctors 
1 Tradition made Richard de Slikeburne Dervorguilla’s confessor (Little, 
Grey Friars, 9, 158 and 216). But Mr. Davis doubts this. The Statutes 
were addressed to Hugh of Hartlepool and William de Menyl, who were, 
no doubt, the agents responsible for administering the moneys granted 
to the Scholars. 
2 The word used is “ utilitas.”’ 
* They were not to be asked to contribute more than one penny in 
any week, 
«They included some Bachelors of Arts. “ 
Midd!  
-P-A-G-E-125
  too A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
ruled that they must take the Arts course only, and it followed 
that they must give up their places when they took their Arts 
degree. : 
These two Proctors, Rectors-or Extraneous Masters—all 
three names are used—overshadowed the Principal of the College, 
and the exercise of their authority sometimes caused discontent. 
One of them till the sixteenth century was always a Franciscan. 
St. Catharine became the Patron Saint of Balliol, but the spirit 
of St. Francis hovered over it still.. Dervorguilla’s letter of 1284 
to Richard de Slikeburne, “ full of Piety and Public-spiritedness,” 
shows how completely she depended upon such advisers to carry 
through her schemes.? She prornised “‘ to ratify and approve 
in all and through all”’ whatever Slikeburne might “‘ order, do, 
change or provide concerning the business of the said scholars.’’ 
In the same year she bought them a permanent home, and 
assigned them a permanent endowment. Moneys due to John 
Balliol’s estate were collected. A property in Northumberland 
was settled on the Principal and Scholars. And before long 
other gifts and purchases passed into their hands. In 1294 the 
acquisition of houses in the London parish of St. Lawrence Jewry 
is said to have introduced a gridiron, that Saint’s uncomfortable 
emblem, into devices on the College walls. A few years later 
the death of William Burnel, Archdeacon of Wells, brought 
several tenements in Fish Street and behind it, including the old 
Jewish Synagogue, into the possession of the College. A block

Davis’ Balliol College (Chap. I), Mr. H. E. Salter’s Oxford Balliol Deeds 
(277-9), and the Fourth Report of the Hist. MSS. Commission (442 sq.). 
I do not think that Dervorguilla’s Statutes and grants of property were 
tantamount to a fresh foundation, for there does not seem to have been 
any break in the life of the Society, or»in the payments made for its 
support, or, so far as we can judge, in most of the customs by which it 
was governed. Dervorguilla only continued and completed what her 
husband had begun,

me tosee them. Mr. Salter’s volume, on these Oxford deeds makes one

of houses let as Schools in Schools Street carried with them the 
site of the Divinity School of the future. And other early pur- 
chases in Oxford included Chimere Hall in Shidyerd Street, near 
the present house of the President of Corpus, which was after- 
wards leased to Canterbury College at a rent of two marks a 
year, and Hert Hall in Merton Street, once the property of Walter 
de Fotheringay, the first recorded Principal of Balliol.1 
Time added by degrees to these resources. In the days 
of Edward III Sir William Felton provided a Rectory and lands 
at Abboldesley or Abbotsley, which raised the Scholars’ allow- 
ances for food and books and clothing and prolonged the College 
benefits after graduation. Clement VI confirmed this arrange- 
ment, and Wycliffe was the Master who ultimately took over the 
Rector’s house. Sir Philip Somervyle in the same age gave an 
endowment in Northumberland, which helped to transform the 
constitution of the College. Friendly prelates, a Gray * or a 
Neville, contributed to its possessions. John Bell, once Bishop 
of Worcester, gave a house in Clerkenwell, to found exhibitions 
for two Worcestershire students. Peter Blundell, a prosperous 
Elizabethan clothier, founded Scholarships for West Country 
boys.4 Leicester’s agent Anthony Foster, Bacon’s sister Lady 
Periam, William Hammond an Elizabethan Fellow, Thomas 
Tesdale, George Abbot and others, supplied funds for Fellowships 
and Scholarships and buildings. Gifts of money and plate fell 
in. A gift of a horn, to summon men to dinner, came from 
William Bell, a liberal-handed Master appointed in 1496. But 
still in the reign of Elizabeth the College revenues were assessed 
at only a hundred pounds a year. Thomas Tesdale’s great 
bequest of five thousand pounds in 1610 was diverted, by methods 
never thoroughly explained, to provide an endowment for 
Pembroke College, and Archbishop Abbot’s generosity could 
only mitigate the loss. After the Restoration Bishop Warner 
and John Snell, the one a prelate who had suffered for his loyalty, 
the other a Glasgow graduate who found fortune in the Law 
Courts of Charles II’s day, left moneys to keep up the Scottish

of Durham.

of Lincoln. (See Visitations of Religious Houses, Lincoln I, xvi, n.) 
4 After some rearrangement Blundell’s bequest added one Fellow and 
one Scholar (two of each after 1676). The Periam bequest added one 
Fellow and two Scholars, making the total numbers, in 1620, 12 Fellows 
ame 13 Scholars. The Blundell Foundation carried certain privileges with

connection and to strengthen the Anglican Church, moneys which 
have helped to seat Glasgow students on the thrones of Canter- 
bury and York. And other donations, stretching through the 
centuries, widened the narrow means of the earlier years. An 
imaginative print reproduced by Skelton? represents a group 
of Balliol benefactors posed under an architectural design— 
John Balliol in evident discomfort from his armour, Dervorguilla 
proffering her Statutes at his side, Somervyle and Felton arguing 
together, Blundell endeavouring to interest Lady Periam, 
Humphrey of Gloucester advancing with a touch of ducal swagger 
from the doorway where Wycliffe.and George Neville overlook 
the scene, and in the foreground Bishop Gray and William Bell 
and others receiving from attendant Cupids plans which the 
College authorities needed fresh benefactions to complete. 
The Statutes and traditions of the College were largely 
modified in 1340 by Somervyle’s gift, which Edward Balliol, 
King of Scots, confirmed. The sixteen Scholars or Fellows of 
Balliol were at first a struggling undergraduate Society, of an 
earlier type than any other Oxford College, whose members left 
when their Arts course was completed, and whose places were 
filled up by the College Proctors. Somervyle drafted a new code 
of Statutes, though he protested that he had no wish to abolish 
the old. He provided funds for six additional Arts students, 
to be elected by the other Fellows. And he directed that six 
of the Fellows, also chosen by election, should continue to hold 
Fellowships as Divinity students after taking their Arts degree.? 
Graduate members, theological study, and the practice of electing 
each other came in. All Fellows alike were to have their pay 
raised to elevenpence weekly, or even to fifteen pence if times 
were bad, with extra pay for the weeks of the great Feasts. They 
were to have allowances in sickness also. They were not to be 
useless or luxurious or vicious, but to avoid scandal, quarrelling 
and sin. But with these exhortations Somervyle introduced a 
good deal of confusion into the College rules, Above the Principal 
he set a Master with superior powers and substantial pay, with 
a private room and a servant to attend him, and with wide 
authority in matters of discipline and administration. The 
form of the Master’s election was prescribed. He was to be

4Mr. Davis thinks (31) that Somervyle’s arrangements were closely 
affected by the Felton endowment: but the subject is obscure. There 
was a new Chaplain as well as new Fellows. I should like to add here 
a special word of thanks to Mr. Davis, to whose history of the College 
I am constantly indebted. 
3 The Master and two of the senior Fellows associated with him were 
to compose differences and to correct offences (Stats. of Colls. I, Balliol, 
xiv.). 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
THE EARLIEST COLLEGES 103 
confirmed by Somervyle’s representative, by the Chancellor of 
the University, and by the Prior of the monks of Durham College 
next door. But the Master’s relation to Principal and Fellows, 
to Dervorguilla’s Proctors, to the outside dignitaries who had a 
voice in his appointment, and to the Bishop of Durham, who, 
apparently, was to act as a supreme Visitor over them all, must 
have raised problems difficult to solve.t 
It is evident that Somervyle’s Statutes were not a success. 
In 1365 they were to some extent superseded by new regulations 
promulgated by Bishop Sudbury of London, under the sanction 
of the Pope. These regulations have unhappily disappeared. 
But it seems that they made the Bishop of London Visitor of 
the College, strengthening perhaps the ecclesiastical influence 
already introduced, and that they recognised also to a large 
extent the authority of the old Proctors or Rectors. A later 
document suggests that this authority was sometimes abused.? 
The office of Principal came to an end. The Master was in 
course of time permitted to hold a benefice of any value. Chap- 
lains and outsiders, as well as Fellows, were made eligible for 
appointment as Master. Some traditions of self-government, 
even if limited in scope, remained. In case any Statute proved 
too rigorous or too lax in the judgment of the Rectors, it was to 
“be in the bosome”’ of the Bishop of London to make matters 
tight. Finally, in 1507, after a petition sent by the College to 
Rome, which complained that the Rectors’ powers had been 
exceeded, and which induced Alexander Borgia to intervene 
in the cause of virtue, new Statutes were drawn up at the Pope’s 
instigation by Bishop Fox of Winchester,‘ the Founder of Corpus 
Christi College, which governed the House of Balliol for three 
centuries and a half. 
The Statutes of 1507, though not uninfluenced by old associa- 
tions, made many changes and proved to be a comprehensive 
plan. The early College of Arts students developed into a 
training-place for theologians and divines. It received the

Paravicini (Early Hist. of Balliol, 183 sq.) prints an English version. Mr. 
Davis (35) finds in one phrase some dim beginnings of a tutorial system : 
but the passage he refers to (Stats. I, Balliol, xi) is not very clear. He 
also puts the weekly allowances at 12d., but 11d. is the figure in the 
Statutes.

Statutes more than once.

unique privilege of choosing its own Visitor: it had been tried 
by too many Visitors in days gone by. The number of Fellows 
was reduced to ten, and in them the government of the House 
was vested, Careful rules for their election were laid down. These 
Fellows were all to be Bachelors, Masters or Doctors. The 
power of the Rectors or Proctors disappeared. The Master, a 
priest of mature years, learned in theology, became little more 
than the Head of an aristocracy of Fellows. The Bursars took 
charge of the College estates. The two Deans became primarily 
responsible for the Library and the Chapel, for the discipline 
and studies of the place. For both Master-and Fellows regular 
residence was insisted on. Two of the Fellowships were to be 
filled by Priests, and beyond that every Fellow was to take 
Priest’s Orders within four years of his Master’s degree. The 
weekly commons were raised to sixteen, and in certain cases to 
twenty, pence. Masters received a stipend of twenty shillings 
and eightpence, Bachelors received eighteen shillings and two- 
pence a year. Grants in money were assigned for all who took 
degrees. Excessive expenses were to be avoided. The Fellows 
were still poor ; a cure of souls or forty shillings of private income 
disqualified for election; and any Fellow whose income rose 
above a hundred shillings was expected to resign. Besides the 
Fellows a subordinate class of ten ‘‘ Scholastics’? was formed 
out of the younger elements of the College, for whom, under the 
title of Balliol Scholars, the blue ribbon of English Scholarship 
was one day to be reserved. Each Scholastic was nominated 
by one of the Fellows, who may have been generally responsible 
for his conduct and his education: -They were to be sufficiently 
skilled in plain song and grammar, to study logic, to wear sur- 
plices in Chapel, to wait on the Fellows at table and live on the 
food which was left, to bear themselves honestly towards their 
' superiors till a chance came of stepping into their shoes.1_ But 
they were given no share in the government of the place. Besides 
these Scholastics the College might take in boarders not on the 
foundation, Commoners who paid for the advantages they 
received.? 
All members of the College were bound to attend services on 
Sundays and Feast-days, under penalty of a fine. Scholastics 
who failed to do so might even be whipped. Regular disputations 
1 These Scholastici sive servitores, with the clerical habit and tonsure, 
had to be nominated before they were eighteen. They had some preference 
in the Fellowship elections. They held their places till they were twenty- 
four (Statutes, Balliol, 9). 
2 The wording of the Statutes (Balliol, 19-20) suggests that Commoners 
were admitted, and in the fifteenth century Balliol’ probably derived both 
money and importance from this source.
-P-A-G-E-130
  THE EARLIEST COLLEGES 105 
in logic, philosophy and theology were to be held. A portion 
from Scripture or from one of the Doctors of the Church was to 
be read in public during dinner. Latin except on rare occasions 
was to be spoken, where now it cannot be whispered except 
at the risk of being “sconced.” Quarrels, noise, immoderate 
laughter, unfitting sports and occupations were forbidden. 
Mingling with actors was to be eschewed. Public taverns were 
to be avoided—“ poison once imbibed”? might ruin the body. 
On the other hand provision was made for an “ honest, provident, 
sagacious”’ cook. The College gates were to be closed at nine 
in summer and at eight in winter ; the Master kept the keys ; 
and anyone spending the night out of College, or making his 
way in again by illicit means, was liable to fine or whipping. 
The Master also was responsible for allotting rooms and gardens: 
small allotment gardens apparently went with the rooms. In 
days of plague or pestilence, which were not infrequent, the 
College might withdraw into the country, not too far away. 
And as “all the grace and loveliness of a visible body is 
begotten of the beauty of its members,’ so morals, character 
and industry were required of all alike. The Master was the 
head, possessing the five senses, the power to see, to hear, to 
smell, to taste, to touch. The senior Fellow was the neck. 
The two Deans were the two shoulders. The Bursars were the 
arms and hands, The rest of the Fellows were no better than 
the stomach, and the Scholastics merely shin-bones. Fox, when 
dealing with an old foundation, made no attempt to introduce 
the ideas of the Renaissance. But, reviewing his work and 
rejoicing in his metaphors, he foresaw a noble harmony reSulting 
from his plans. 
John Balliol’s Scholars, if tradition may be trusted, took up 
their quarters on the spot where now their Master lives,” in a 
house in Horsemonger Street beyond the North Wall. The 
house belonged to the University and was known afterwards as 
Old Balliol Hall. In 1284 Dervorguilla bought for them the 
site of a new Hall, three tenements with plots of land a little 
further East, where now the Western half of the front quadrangle 
stands. A few years later a garden to the North was added, and 
early in the fourteenth century the acquisition of four more 
tenements carried the College boundaries Eastwards as far as 
1 For Fox’s Statutes see Stats. of Colls. (Balliol, 1-22), De Paravicini 
(244 sq.), and Davis (66-75). 
2 There is no evidence for this beyond tradition. But we know that 
“Old Baylolhall ” occupied part of this site in 1300 and was then inhabited 
by students. St. Margaret Hall, to the East of it, occupied the rest. 
The former was styled Sparrow Hall later. One of Dervorguilla’s pur- 
chases, Mareys or Mary’s Hall, apparently became the nucleus of the new 
Hall for Balliol’s students. 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
    1o6 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Durham College. In 1342 St. Margaret Hall was secured be- 
tween the old House of Balliol and the new, and fresh purchases 
gradually extended the College property Westward to St. Giles’. 
An ancient holding of St. Frideswide’s was secured, where later 
Hammond’s Lodging was to rise,1 a house or two at the corner 
of Broad Street, and grounds and tenements stretching North 
towards St. John’s. But it was not till long afterwards that 
Balliol completed its frontage to St. Giles’ by buying up two 
famous inns, first the Catharine Wheel under the shadow of 
St. Mary Magdalen’s, a well-known tavern of the seventeenth 
century, to which Oxfordshire farmers brought forage for Rupert’s 
Cavaliers, and secondly the Cardinal’s Hat, a still older hostelry 
beyond it, over whose grounds the careless generations still play 
bowls.? 
The dwelling called Old Balliol Hall was leased from the 
University in 1379, and taken over in exchange for the site 
of the Divinity School in 1427. The Chapel was built much 
sooner. Before the end of the thirteenth century the Bishop 
of Lincoln allowed the Scholars of Balliol to have an Oratory of 
their own, instead of attending service in St. Mary Magdalen’s 
Church, and early in the next century new Chapel buildings were 
begun.? A document of 1328 tells us that the Abbot of Reading 
gave gifts of money and a window for this fabric of St. Catharine’s, 
worth in all thirty-six pounds, thirteen shillings and fourpence, 
besides timber and building materials carriage free. This 
Chapel was used for some two hundred years. In the days of 
Henry VIII, however, it made way for a new one, with a muni- 
ment-room or Treasury attached. Contracts for the mason’s 
work begun in 1521 are still preserved. At the West end of this 
new Chapel a great window opened into the Library, adorned 
by a picture of St. Catharine, sword and wheel in hand. At the 
other end a noble painted window given by Laurence Stubbs, a 
brother of the Master and himself a President of Magdalen, 
represented, we are told, “ in lively Colours and exquisite Postures 
the Passion, Resurrection and Ascension of Christ.’”’ The nine- 
teenth century destroyed this ‘“‘comely and decent chapple,” 
1 The site of Hammond’s Lodging has been disputed, but Mr. Salter 
has worked out the whole problem of the site of the College buildings 
with great thoroughness (Oxf. Balliol Deeds, Section I and Note I). 
2 It was not quite completed even then, The Inns were not bought 
till the eighteenth century, though leased much earlier. 
% About 1327. Mr, Salter gives good reasons (19 and 360-1) for rejecting 
the tradition which identifies the old Chapel with the Master’s dining-room. 
It seems that the site of the dining-room was not acquired till after the 
Chapel was built: and the wording of document 608 in Oxford Balliol 
Deeds seems scarcely applicable to an upstairs room. The first Chapel 
may have stood on the site where later Chapels followed.

to replace it by one of the worst incongruities of Victorian taste. 
But the colours and postures of the fine old glass were rescued, 
and their mellow beauty dignifies the modern windows yet. 
The reign of Henry VI saw the College buildings growing and 
the old quadrangle taking shape. Wood dates the Hall on the 
West side from the days of that unhappy King.? At the upper 
end of it was set a ‘‘ Lion rampant with a Bordure charged with 
Fleurs de Lis.” At right-angles to the Hall, on the North side, 
a noble Library arose. Masters like Thomas Chace and Robert 
Abdy, helped by benefactors like Bishop Clifford and Bishop 
Gray, made the Library buildings worthy of the treasures collected 
for them. Gray was one of the first to appreciate the oppor- 
tunities of the Renaissance, and some hundred and fifty of his 
splendid legacy of manuscripts remain.? The windows were 
filled with paintings and escutcheons. Mottoes and arms, of 
Montagu and Neville, Stafford and Beauchamp, Clifford and 
Percy, recalled not only the story of the College, but the storied 
names of English history. And when the fanatics made war on 
superstition and ‘‘ obscured with black paint ‘‘the pictures of 
the Saints, the less dangerous emblems of heraldry for a season 
at any rate survived.4 Another Master, William Bell, at the 
end of the fifteenth century, is credited with building the beauti- 
ful low tower and gate-way, which with its oriel window lasted 
into recent times. For some generations a forecourt set with 
elms separated this tower from the street beyond. A hundred 
years later Hammond’s bequest rendered possible an extension 
of the front in Candich, to begin the South side of a new quad- 
rangle. Under James I the pensioners of Lady Periam are said 
to have found quarters in a building in the garden, of which only 
the traditional site remains, and the College leased a tenement 
1 Abraham Van Linge also contributed two fine windows in 1637. 
And older glass—e.g. the kneeling figure of Sir W. Compton, the founder 
of a great house—remains. (See Mr. Grinling’s paper, Oxf. Architect. Soc. 
IV, 111 sq.) 
: Thera (Memorials, I, Balliol 11-12) would carry back the plans to 
the days of Richard II., Chace, who was Master from 1412 to 1428, built 
the Western half of the Library. Mr. Davis (45) summarises the process 
thus: ‘‘ The builders began at the east side of the quadrangle. Then the 
Old Hall was erected ; then the lower or western half of the Old Library ; 
then the Master’s House ; and then the eastern part of the Old Library. 
Finally, at the end of the century, the block of buildings which faced 
Broad Street was entirely re-cast.” 
3 But some Balliol MSS., including an Ockham presented by Gray, 
have found their way to other libraries. (See Bodleian Quarterly Record,

  108 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
called Cesar’s Lodging in St. Giles’, to house the Tesdale 
Scholars whom Pembroke immediately annexed. Here another 
tower and gate-way were one day to rise, and other buildings 
on the courts about them. But in the seventeenth century 
financial troubles allowed the College to sink into disrepair, and 
Shaftesbury’s followers had no- difficulty in_renting rooms there 
when they descended on Oxford in 1681.2 Little save the 
Master’s dining-room with its noble oriel window, the old Hall 
and the old Library with the Common Room beneath it, now 
recalls the ancient beauty of the College. Its modern rulers have 
stoically chosen to find its best monuments in the achievements 
of its sons. 
As time went on, however, the House of Balliol made its way. 
Its Scholars won credit. Its Masters, if not often specially dis- 
tinguished, contributed their limited learning to the Church.® 
Great, shadowy names have been associated with it, Duns Scotus, 
who is claimed by Merton with as little justice, Humphrey of 
Gloucester, who shines in Oxford history with a glory reflected 
from the world of letters,‘ and others whose connection with the 
College stands on firmer ground. “Wood gives a list of eighteen 
prelates whose education is attributed to it;including a Cardinal, 
a Patriarch of Alexandria and five| Archbishops. The list is 
headed by Richard Fitz-Ralph, ‘“ Armachanus,”’ Archbishop of 
Armagh, the great fourteenth-century Schoolman and divine, 
who proved so stern a critic of the Mendicant Orders, and in 
some ways so remarkable a fore-runner ofWycliffe. Wycliffe 
himself was Master of Balliol some time between 1356 and 1361.5 
Thomas Chace, a leading figure in the, University in Lancastrian 
days, Robert Abdy, who succeeded jn 1477, and William Bell, 
who was Master twenty years later, all contributed vigorously to 
the rebuilding of the College, while Richard Stubbs is identified 
1 But Loggan shows no Periam™ building, and Czxsar’s Lodging was 
probably only a part of the buildings of the old Cardinal’s Hat, which had 
now ceased to be an inn, and had been leased by Christ Church to Elizabeth 
Alwin in 1609. This lease Balliol may have bought from Elizabeth Alwin 
with the £300 which Archbishop Abbot is‘said to have provided after 1610. 
The College did not buy the property till 1773. Pompey, a building which 
“stood over against ” Cesar, a little further East, was also probably a 
part of the buildings of the Cardinal’s Hat (Salter, Oxf. Ball. Deeds, 
73-4 and 362).

4 Bale (Script. Illust. maj. Brit. 1557, 583) and Leland (Comment. de 
Script. Brit. 442) are chiefly responsible for this tradition. But Mr. 
K. H. Vickers (Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, 9) and Mr. J. H. Wylie 
(Hist. of England under Henry IV, iv, 135) seem inclined to accept it.

with the Chapel begun about 1521. The fifteenth century was 
a great age at Balliol, if the traditions of the Commoners associated 
with it may be trusted. Lord Berners, the translator of Froissart, 
and Cuthbert Tunstall, a notable Bishop of Tudor days, were 
probably members of the College. And of William Gray’s 
connection with it there can be no doubt. That famous Bishop 
of Ely was most famous as~@% humanist ; he enriched the old 
foundation with his scholarship and taste. George Neville was 
a more splendid prelate, Archbishop of York and brother to the 
King-maker. His arms, it is said, were once to be seen in the 
great window of the Master’s dining-room, where Bishop Gray’s 
were carved below. A spoilt child of fortune, ‘“ of blood virtue 
and cunning,’ Neville was made Chancellor of the University 
when barely twenty-one, and Chancellor of England not long 
afterwards. ‘‘ Moult facondieux,” he could quote Jeremiah or 
Lucan to give point to sermons or letters, or to excuse a political 
shift. His conduct called for such excuses more than once. A 
Master of Balliol has dwelt lovingly on one Gargantuan feast 
which Neville gave, when two or three thousand guests sat 
down to dine on sixteen hundred hogsheads of liquor and thirty 
thousand birds and beasts. There was little left of John Balliol’s 
frugality or of the old Franciscan tradition in that magnificent 
clergyman’s repast. 
College historians have counted as a Balliol man John Tiptoft, 
the brilliant and sinister Earl of Worcester, whom George Neville, 
his brother-in-law, failed to save from the scaffold, and who, 
like Gray, spoiled the libraries of Italy for books. But to Tiptoft 
it seems that University College has a better claim. Another 
prelate and politician, more fortunate in days of revolution, was 
John Morton, Bishop of Ely, whose strawberries King Richard 
loved, and whose shrewd counsels helped to seat King Henry on 
the throne. Morton came up from Dorsetshire and spent some 
years at Oxford, and played his part in University affairs.2 But 
this ‘‘ dearest son’”’ of the University was never very quick to 
reciprocate the University’s affection, and he left to his old 
College nothing but the honour of his name. Balliol students 
like John Free and John Gunthorpe, who shared in the enthusiasm 
caused by the Renaissance, have a high place also among the 
scholars who sought fortune in Italy in those entrancing years. 
The College made faint efforts at the Reformation to resist 
the King’s demands. But the Master, Whyte, a nominee of 
1 Balliofergus (104-8). It seems probable that this particular banquet 
was given on Neville’s installation as Archbishop of York. (See D.N.B. 
and Hearne’s Collections, II, 342-3.) But he, no doubt, gave great 
dinners at Oxford too.

quickly to St. John’ s, and George Bradshaw, for long Lawrence’s 
rival, stepped into his place. 
Bradshaw’s reign was brief, but Henry Savage, the College 
historian,1 who became Master in 1651, proved so adaptable that 
he kept his post for. over twenty years. His wife, a lady of 
family, was the first to live in the Master’s house. The new 
Master and the new Fellows seem to have added little to the 
character of the College. Strong convictions apparently went 
out of fashion. “Nicholas Crouch, who held a Fellowship from 
1634 to 1690, kept a diary destitute of interest even in the 
stirring days through which he passed.? Another Fellow pub- 
lished opinions upon cock-fighting. A third earned the reputa- 
tion of an atheist by admiring Hobbes. John Kyrle, the “‘ Man 
of Ross’? whom Pope made famous, came up as a Fellow-Com- 
moner in 1654. Hannibal Baskerville, the eccentric antiquary, 
noted that old customs like the Act Supper were still kept 
up in Balliol Hall. At the Restoration James Thicknes, 
Evelyn’s friend, expelled by the Parliament’s Visitors, was 
restored by a writ from'the King. ‘The\College finances were in 
hopeless confusion 3; to remedy them it was proposed to put 
Scholarships down. ‘Too many Balliol men spent their time in 
“‘a dingy, horrid, scandalous ale-house”’ close by. Savage's 
successor, Thomas Goode, struggled in vain against the manners 
of the Restoration, and did his best to collect money for the 
College. Politics ran high and churchmanship ran narrow, 
though Shaftesbury:’s Whigs found a brief home’at Balliol in the 
stormy days of the Exclusion Bill. Numbers declined sharply. 
Fellows were constantly away on leave. Corrupt resignations 
were not unknown. The buildings, though something was done 
to the Chapel, were described as “ falling/ to pieces through 
age.’ The College even sank so low that a President of Trinity 
could throw stones against its windows in the hope of completing 
the ruin of the place. 
While John Balliol’s Scholars were living on their weekly 
eightpence in a humble House beyond the North wall, Walter 
1 Savage was the author of Balliofergus, which inspite of its weaknesses 
was the first attempt to base a College history on authentic records. The 
second part of the title is apparently a reference to the ancestry of Dervor- 
guilla. 
2 Davis (139-40). 
The London property of the College suffered in the great fire. In 
1667 the College, among other debts, owed its butcher £50. It was reduced 
to melting some of its new plate. Goode and Mander (who became Master 
in 1687) made great efforts to restore the College. The worst debts were 
cleared off, and benefactions came in, including the Warner and Snell 
Exhibitions and some useful livings later. (See Davis, 160-6.)

  THE EARLIEST COLLEGES 113 
de Merton conceived and carried to completion his memorable 
plan for the endowment of a College. Walter de Merton was 
the first great English prelate who, lacking by Church law heirs 
of his body, resolved to leave the world of scholars an inheritance . 
instead. Early traditions suggest that as a boy he had come up 
from Basingstoke, where his parents died and where he founded 
a hospital as a memorial to them, to live as a student at Mauger 
Hall in the Cornmarket, and to be recommended to Grosseteste 
by Adam Marsh. But we know little of him till we find him a 
busy official in the Royal service, holding a surprising number 
of benefices in all parts of the Kingdom. From 1261 to 1263 
he was Chancellor of England, and a staunch adherent of the 
King in the quarrels of the day. In 1264, as a too prominent 
King’s man, he had his property plundered by a London mob. 
On Henry’s death he acted once again as Chancellor, but he 
passed on to the Bishopric of Rochester in 1274. He died in 
1277, from a fall of his horse in fording the Medway. But 
he had lived long enough by that time to complete his great 
design. 
Walter de Merton’s plans began as early as 1262. In that 
year he obtained a charter from the Earl of Gloucester, empower- 
ing him to assign his manors at Farleigh and Malden to the 
Priory of Merton ‘‘ for the perpetual support of clerks spending 
their time in schools.’ A little later he varied his scheme, and 
” 1 Ad perpetuam sustentationem clericorum in scolis degentium. 
The phrase “‘ in studio degentium ”’ is used a few lines later. The charter 
is given in Kilner (Pythagoras’s School, 51) and translated by Percival 
(Foundation Stats. of Merton Coll. 1). The words “in scolis degentes”” may, 
no doubt, be rendered ‘residing at the schools,”’ that is the University. 
Besides the documents in the Merton, Archives, Kilner’s notes on them and 
Bishop Hobhouse’s Life of Walter de Merton are authorities on the foun- 
dation. Halliwell’s Foundation Documents are worth consulting. The 
Statutes of 1264, 1270 and 1274 and later ordinances are printed in the 
Stats. of Oxf. Colleges. Percival gives some useful translations and details. 
Ingram (Mems. I) has something, Ayliffe (Ancient and Present State of 
Oxford, I, 272~7) not much, to add. Mr. Brodrick’s Memorials of Merton 
Coll. and his article in The Colleges of Oxford are well known. Dr. B. W. 
Henderson’s later history has a valuable Appendix on the original 
authorities and many interesting details. Mr. H. J. White’s little mono- 
graph should be mentioned, and the Sixth Report of Hist. MSS. Commission 
(545). There is a great deal of unprinted material in the Archives, which 
the Bursar kindly allowed me to consult, Bursars’ Rolls and other records 
deserving much fuller examination: Mr. W. H. Stevenson’s Calendar is 
an indispensable guide. The first two of Kilner’s volumes of MS. contain 
a good account of Walter de Merton, of the early Statutes and ordinances, 
and of the Liber Ruber, a catalogue or abstract of College deeds, dated 1288. 
A transcript of this was made in 1728. The College Register, in 5 vols., 
has been partly indexed : the two earliest run from 1483 to 1567 and from 
1567 onwards, and are fullofinterest. A great part of this unique Register, 
down to the year 1521 (f. 255%), has been prepared for publication by

  114 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
made over these lands for the support and studies of eight of his 
own kinsmen under the charge of a Warden and Chaplains. In 
1264 he went beyond this and established by a regular charter 
the House of the Scholars of Merton at Malden in Surrey, for the 
perpetual support of twenty Scholars at Oxford or elsewhere, 
and of two or three Chaplains residing in the House.1 The 
Warden of the House at Malden was charged with its adminis- 
tration, and he and his brethren resided there. The property 
was to be used for the benefit of the Scholars, who were entitled 
to inquire into its management every year. The Scholars were 
intended to live at the University, with a common dwelling and 
acommon dress. But it is not easy to say when this provision 
came into force.2 The years of the Civil War and of the migra- 
tion to Northampton could not have been a favourable moment 
for establishing scholars at Oxford.? It seems that these events 
interrupted the Founder’s plans. And the later charters suggest 
Mr. Salter, who generously put his proofs at my disposal. Only recently 
a vellum sheet containing the Sub-Warden’s accounts for the year 1299 
was found by chance among papers packed away in an attic. 
1 The words of the deed in the Merton Archives are “ad perpetuam 
sustentationem viginti scholarium in scholis degentium Oxonie vel alibi 
ubi studium vigere contigerit, et ad sustentationem duorum vel trium 
ministrorum altaris Christi in dicta Domo residentium.”” The version in 
Kilner (61) is slightly different. 
2 Bishop Hobhouse conjectures (12-13) that these Scholars were from 
the first ‘‘ chiefly housed in Oxford.” But this is a conjecture only, and 
I cannot find in the documents or in the language of the Statutes any 
evidence that a separate House or community of Merton Scholars came 
into existence in Oxford before the Merton Street buildings arose. This is 
not of course impossible, but on the whole I think it more likely that the 
Oxford part of the scheme waited till the buildings were ready. Merton 
recast his project more than once, and the “ troubles ” of the time delayed 
its completion. At one time, it seems, he bought land at Cambridge 
(Twyne, III, 592). But from 1266 onwards he bought land at Oxford, 
and money flowed in to enlarge his plans. In 1274, in his final Statutes, 
he recites the story of the foundation of the ‘‘ House of the Scholars of 
Merton,” founded and settled on his own property before the recent 
troubles in England arose: “‘ it was situated at Malden, in the county of 
Surrey, and was destined for the constant support of scholars residing 
in schools.” (I quote Mr. Brodrick’s translation, Mems. 317-18)... . 
“ But now that peace is restored in England, and our old troubles are 
allayed, I approve with firm purpose of mind, establish, and confirm the 
former grant ; and I limit, grant, and assign the local habitation and home 
of the school to be at Oxford, where there is a prosperous University of 
students, on my own proper freehold which abuts upon St. John’s Church.” 
It is difficult to infer from this that Merton had been maintaining a separate 
House for his scholars at Oxford for ten years past. The Latin version 
should be consulted too. 
® In the notes to Hutten’s Antiquities (Plummet’s Elizabethan Oxford, 
O.H.S., 107) it is suggested that Merton’s House was established at 
Malden in 1264 because Oxford was “ like to come to ruin.”

THE EARLIEST COLLEGES II5 
that he took the opportunity to recast them, and to complete 
them on a larger scale. 
But even if their execution was delayed, the plans went on. 
In 1266 and the years that followed Walter de Merton set to 
work to acquire property on the site which bears his name. A 
Royal license of 1266 to enclose land up to the Town Wall recited 
his intention of building a House for poor scholars in Oxford.* 
A plot of land West of St. John’s Church and three or four houses 
were purchased, near St. Frideswide’s borders and just inside 
the wall.2. The valuable advowsons of St. John’s and of St. 
Peter’s in the East were secured. The latter carried with it the 
Chapel of St. Cross and the manor of Holywell, destined to 
prove a fruitful source of litigation later. In 1267 a Royal license 
empowered the Warden and Scholars of Merton to bring water 
along by conduits from the Cherwell “‘ for the cleansing of their 
court,’’? which shows at least that the building plans were going 
forward. In 1270 the Founder issued another code of Statutes,4 
to confirm in time of peace a scheme drawn up in days of dis- 
turbance. They were on the same lines as those of 1264, but 
with much fuller provisions for the studies and discipline of the 
Scholars. Their numbers and their property were increased. 
Their conduct and business were more closely regulated. Their 
table, dress and burial were provided for. Their morals were 
guarded by a clause which placed the service of the House for 
ever in the hands of males. Finally, in 1274, he revised and 
completed the whole design. He established the Warden at 
the head of his Scholars in their new and permanent home in 
Oxford, and he issued the code which became the model for the 
first of Cambridge Colleges and the example for many a great 
foundation of a later day. 
Walter de Merton not only founded a community. He gave 
shape and purpose to a new ideal. His Scholars were no mere 
pensioners but a corporate fraternity, with a common life, 
1 The license is in the College Archives. See also Kilner (66). 
2 Anthony and Thomas Bek, afterwards well-known Bishops, were 
occupying a part of these premises, once the property of Jacob the Jew, 
and they remained for a time as tenants of the College.

a repetition of those of 1264. See also Hobhouse (34-5). The supposed 
Statutes of 1267 or 1268 in the Archives are probably later than 1274 
(Hobhouse, 32). 
® The Statutes of 1270 show a state of transition. There are, I think, 
clearly Scholars living in Oxford now, and two Sub-Wardens are required, 
one for the business of the House and the other for the students. The 
opportunity to develop the educational side of the foundation has come.

common property, a common Head. And they were, no doubt, 
intended by their training and their education to add to the 
strength and influence of the Church. But they were to take 
no vows and to enter no cloister. It was the secular priesthood 
which Walter de Merton intended to reinforce. Their object 
was study, and that might help to gain them livings in the 
future.1 Simplicity and order were enjoined upon them, but 
austere poverty was not required. The duties of the altar were 
to be performed for them by Chaplains. Handicrafts and manual 
labour, it is perhaps to be regretted, were no part of their work. 
Under the Statutes of 1274 the majority of Merton Scholars were 
to study the Liberal Arts and Philosophies before they were 
allowed to pass on to Theology, the aim and crown of all learning. 
But some ‘‘men of humility” might study Canon Law. One 
member of the College was to be a grammarian or teacher of 
Latin, to whom even advanced students might ‘‘ have recourse 
without a blush.” Every Scholar was to receive fifty shillings 
a year. If his health failed, he was entitled to relief in sickness, 
and might ultimately find a refuge in the Founder’s hospital at 
Basingstoke. He must be chaste, peaceable, humble, poor, of 
good conduct and capacity for study. He must share with the 
others a common table, and as far as possible a common form of 
dress. He must talk Latin in chambers, and abstain from noise, 
and be subject to expulsion if guilty of serious misdeeds. The 
election of new Scholars was to be in the hands of the Warden 
and the thirteen seniors. A year’s trial or probation was allowed. 
Founder’s kin enjoyed a preference ; so did candidates from Win- 
chester and from other dioceses in which the College had estates. 
The Warden of the College was a person of importance. He 
must be a man of discretion in spiritual and temporal affairs. 
He was to be appointed by the Visitor from a list of three selected 
by the seven senior Scholars, but he need not before his election 
be a member of the House. He had a general superintendence 
over all its officers and inmates. He had also general respon- 
sibility for the College property, round which he made a progress 
every year. He had a liberal allowance for his table, horses, 
clothes and servants. He had a deputy, a Vice-Warden or 
Sub-Warden, to assist him. But he was only one member of a 
self-governing Society, and his conduct and management were 
subject to revision and complaint. Three Chaplains at least 
were appointed for the services of the Church, and three times a 
year there was to be a Scrutiny or inquiry into the Society’s

general well-being. Stewards or bailiffs, to be setenbded for 
good service with the rank of Brethren,1 were to manage the 
College estates. Three competent Scholars were to act as 
Bursars, and there was to be a careful audit of accounts. The 
Scholars, whose numbers depended on the funds available, were 
divided into groups of ten or twenty, with a discreet senior over 
each, to encourage the younger ones in their studies and behaviour. 
The Dean was naturally at the head of ten.2 And in every 
chamber where the Scholars lived one of the seniors was put in 
charge. The Visitor* had a supreme jurisdiction, and the 
Warden might, if ‘‘ past endurance,’”’ be impeached before him, 
and removed ‘‘ without the wrangling of a trial at law.”’4 New 
Statutes could be made by the Warden and eight or ten of the 
seniors, and migration from Oxford was not to affect the regula- 
tions of the College. There were directions for the burial of the 
Fellows and for the education of young boys, Founder’s kin, left 
without support. All Scholars. were to live in peace and charity, 
and those who prospered in the world were not to be unmindful 
of the interests of the House.® 
These celebrated Statutes were for many generations the 
basis of the College life. But they were often added to or modified 
by the Visitor’s Injunctions, especially by Archbishop Kilwardby 
in 1276, by Archbishop Patcham in 1284, and by Archbishop 
Chichele in 1425. Kilwardby dealt with a number of details 
which the Founder had left unsettled. He appointed by name 
some of the first officers. He regulated their duties, allowances 
and payments. He ordered the Society’s books and muniments 
to be kept under three locks and the seal under five. He bound 
the Masters of Arts to lecture for three years from their Inception, 
but not to apply for the Chancellor’s license without the knowledge 
1 And with a “‘ perpetuitas in ipsa Domo ” (cap. 22), presumably fixity 
of tenure. These “ Fratres ” or ‘‘ ceconomi’”’ were a part of the Malden 
foundation, and did not migrate apparently to Oxford with the Warden. 
2 The ‘‘ Decanus ”’ grew into the College Dean. The “ Vicenarius ” 
with his group of 20 disappeared. 
* The Archbishop of Canterbury replaced the Bishop of Winchester 
in 1276. Kilwardby accepted the office for his successors.

Mr. Henderson (18) distinguishes from the ‘secondary poor scholars ”

from Malden, and were lodged before long in Nun Hall.

proud. Islip, who succeeded Bradwardine, and Stratford who 
filled the See before him, were both remarkable men. Later on, in 
Lancastrian days, the two Kemps were distinguished sons of the 
College. John Kemp, Archbishop, Chancellor and Cardinal, was 
the faithful Minister of an unhappy King. Thomas, his nephew, 
to whom not only the College but the Divinity School and the 
Library above it owed so much, ruled the great See of London 
many years. Later still, two famous Protestant Bishops were 
added to its roll: Hooper’s right to a place is uncertain, but of 
Jewel’s there can be no doubt. More legendary names have 
found their way into its records—Roger Bacon, Duns Scotus, 
William of Ockham: but no one has established their claim to 
figure there.t Nor can the great John Wycliffe be confidently 
included among Merton worthies, though one bearer of his name 
was certainly a Fellow of the College in his time. Walter Burley 
has perhaps a better title. He was a philosopher of wide repu- 
tation, reported to have been once a pupil of Duns Scotus, and 
to have written a hundred and thirty treatises on Aristotle 
alone. 
Mathematics and astronomy in particular flourished at Merton 
in the fourteenth century,? and in spite of Archbishop Patcham 
medical science too. John Gaddesden and John Ashenden 
belonged to a long line of men of science who brought credit.to 
the College for two hundred years. John Chambre, Warden in 
1525, was physician to Henry VIII and his father, and was 
associated with Linacre in the foundation of the College of 
Physicians. Linacre’s money founded two medical Lecturerships 
at Merton. Wolsey appointed a Fellow to lecture on medicine 
there. Another medical Fellow, who became President of the 
College of Physicians, watched over the health of the Virgin 
Queen. William Harvey, the greatest doctor of them all, though 
no product of Oxford, was for a brief time Warden of the College 
in the Civil Wars. He owed his appointment to the intervention 
of King Charles; so Cromwell retorted by nominating Dr. 
Goddard, his own physician, to the Wardenship in turn. After 
the Restoration Warden Clayton, an inadequate Professor of 
Physic and Anatomy, kept the medical tradition up. 
Other Wardens besides these enjoyed celebrity, at Oxford or 
1 Dr. Henderson has an interesting Appendix (C) on the Merton 
Catalogues of Fellows, and on some disputed names. In his text he is 
perhaps inclined to be generous to some doubtful claims. 
2 This difficult question of identification is discussed later (pp. 222-3). 
Dr. Henderson has a note on the subject (291-2). 
% Bradwardine heads a list of mathematicians who included Rede, 
Simon Bredon, Maudith and others. Oxford science had a great reputation 
in the fourteenth century. (See Mr. Gunther’s volumes on Early Science 
in Oxford.)

in the world outside. One, in the thirteenth century, gave the 
dwelling afterwards known as Postmasters’ Hall. Another, in 
the fourteenth century, died of the plague. Three Wardens in 
the fifteenth century contributed handsomely to the College 
buildings—Thomas Rodeborne, a noted mathematician, Henry 
Sever, the first Provost of Eton, who enjoyed a large number of 
benefices elsewhere, and Richard Fitzjames, a distinguished ruler 
of early Tudor days. John Bloxham helped Edward III in 
his diplomacy. Robert Gilbert was with Henry V in France. 
Richard Rawlins, a careless and hospitable gentleman, accom- 
panied a later Sovereign, Henry VIII, upon his French adventures. 
But he neglected the College interests. He was a constant 
absentee. He crowned his offences by selling the land on which 
the new College of Corpus Christi was to rise. Worse than that ; 
“he hardened his heart against the College Statutes and perti- 
naciously defended his misdeeds.” In 1521 the Archbishop of 
Canterbury decreed that Rawlins must be cut off from the College 
“like a rotten member.” ! John Chambre survived the Refor- 
mation and Cranmer’s interference with the College customs. 
Thomas Rainolds may have owed his appointment to Cranmer, 
but he found it possible to act as Vice-Chancellor to Pole. He 
failed to save the Library from plunder by extreme Reformers. 
He accepted a Bishopric from Queen Mary, and perhaps deserved 
to lose both Bishopric and Wardenship in 1559. Under Rainolds, 
while the College declined,? two Fellows, Richard Smith and 
William Tresham, made their mark as defenders of the old religion. 
Smith preached with grim humour before the martyrdom of 
Latimer and Ridley on the text ‘‘though I give my body to be 
burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing.” By 
charity the preacher apparently meant readiness to recant 
opinions, for he more than once recanted his own. 
A modern Warden, the historian of the College and till lately 
a familiar figure in its courts, has brought together many details 
of the lives of the early Fellows. We see them, generation after 
generation, students and churchmen, mathematicians and philo- 
sophers, learning, teaching, practising divinity and medicine, 
reading the stars, leaving bequests of books and plate and money 
to the College which they loved, mixing sometimes later in the 
larger world of politics, but concerned more deeply while in 
Oxford with the smaller world of Oxford life. They had diffi- 
culties with their Wardens. They had difficulties over the Col- 
lege Scrutinies, strange irregularities of conduct, language, dress.   1 College Register (I, 502-7. I quote by Mr. Salter’s kind permission 
the pages of his edition, which as I write is passing through the press).

Register, I, xxiii).

  122 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
They had difficulties with the townsmen, not only the time- 
honoured feud between cleric and layman, but their own particular 
quarrels about the College rights in Holywell and the control of 
the town ditch.1 - They had difficulties over religion. Wycliffe 
had a strong following at Merton, and all Archbishop Arundel’s 
authority was needed to suppress it. But other Merton men, 
Ralph Strode, the philosopher and friend of Chaucer,? and 
William Berton, who took a leading part in condemning the 
Reformer, were on the other side. In the battles of the Nations 
Merton warriors were not backward. One, an ex-Proctor, is 
alleged to have killed a man with a shaft from his bow—a feat 
which did not prevent his enjoying Church preferment or being 
“clericus familiaris Pape” afterwards. Merton men generally 
fought in the ranks of the South,? and John Wylliott, a College 
benefactor, was carried ‘‘ tumultuously ” into the Chancellorship 
by his Southern adherents in 1349. Gifts flowed in. Two 
memorable gifts date from the last quarter of the fourteenth 
century. The beautiful Library was built by Bishop Rede of 
Chichester, a generous friend of Oxford and an astronomer who 
had predicted the Black Death. And Wylliott’s well-known 
donation established a new class of Merton Scholars. The 
“ Portioniste,” poor boys with a stinted portion, were at first 
poor scholars or servitors, housed where they could find room. 
They waited in Hall at meal-times, and shared the broken 
food. They sang in the Chapel choir. But after 1519 they were 
housed together opposite the College in the building called Post- 
masters’ Hall. They had their own Principal, their own lectures, 
1See Collectanea (III, 147-8) and Ogle(Royal Letters, 83-4). 
2 Some would make Ralph Strode the tutor of Chaucer’s boy Lewis at 
Oxford. But-the relation between the R. Strode of Tanner, the N. Strode 
of Chaucer’s treatise on the astrolabe, and the W. Strode of the Oriel 
codex is not clear. (Compare The Ancient Kalendar of the University of 
Oxford, O.H.Sy 13, andthe article on Ralph Strode in D.N.B.) 
% Dr. Henderson thinks (46) there were exceptions to this rule. 
4The term Portioniste.may have been corrupted into Post-ministri, 
Post-magisivi and so Postmasters. But the familiar name is quite as likely 
to bean ancient College joke. Early in the sixteenth century their numbers 
were limited to equal those of the Masters (Goll. Reg. I, ed. Salter, 249 and 
356). They were then apparently nominated by the senior Fellows for 
five years—each Master-Fellow nominating one.’ In 1575 their number 
was fixed at twelve, and soon after that they were moved over into the 
College. Later gifts increased their number and allowances. They 
became pre-eminently the Scholars of Merton, perhaps absorbing or 
replacing any earlier class of poor Scholars: though Twyne speaks of 
29 Poor Scholars apart from the 12 “ Portioniste ” in 1612 (XXI, 514). 
For Wylliott’s assignment of “‘ Battes In” and tenements adjoining it, 
see Collectanea (III, \147), and for Wylliott’s foundation and its early 
history see Mr. Salter’s edition of the College Register (Introduction, 
xii-xv, and Appendix II).

their own allowances, which subsequent benefactions substantially 
increased. And they developed into a fortunate community 
. which even Eton boys were glad to reinforce. 
The early Tudor period, when Fitzjames was Warden, is 
illustrated by delightful entries in the College Register, often in 
Fitzjames’ hand. There are notes of Chapters and elections, 
notes about the studies, the promotions and the deaths of the 
Fellows. There are notes of leases and of law-suits. There are 
notes about the College property, its money, its vestments, its 
jewels and books, accounts of the progresses which the Wardens 
and the Bursars made. There are notes also on the buildings and 
the servants, on College events and College festivals, Inceptions, 
benefactions, outbreaks of the plague. Now and again we get 
a glimpse of public matters, an insurrection or a battle: Henry 
VII was not too securely seated on his throne. We hear of 
Perkin Warbeck, of the death of Prince Arthur, of the funeral 
of Queen Elizabeth, at which Warden Fitzjames preached. The 
Lady Margaret founds a lecture. The Princess Margaret marries 
the Scottish King. A tournament is held at Westminster. 
Executions occur on Tower Hill. Later on, in 1518, Queen 
Catharine, like Juno and Minerva, visits Merton, declining, as the 
Warden notes, all invitations to go elsewhere.1_ But most of the 
entries relate purely to College affairs. Fitzjames figures largely. 
He was a power in the College and much beloved. Even the 
acceptance of three Bishoprics in succession, involving frequent 
absences, did not break his spell. When he resigned in 1507, the 
Fellows were ‘‘as orphans bereft of their parents: the very 
house seemed up-rooted and well-nigh overturned.” Warden 
Rawlins, on the other hand, was guilty of shortcomings which 
could not be overlooked. Faults have to be punished—not as 
a tule too heavily. Morality has to be enforced. One Fellow, 
convicted of very scandalous offences, is sentenced to expulsion, 
but allowed five months’ grace ‘‘ for the honour of the College.” 
Others are rebuked or fined. In one case even a sentence of a 
penny produces “‘ fury and passion”’ instead of an acknowledg- 
ment of guilt.? 
There are inevitably some chronicles of quarrels, of mis- 
demeanours, of ‘‘ opprobrious words.”’ We hear that the Masters 
abhor to sit with the Bachelors, that the Bachelors, worse still, 
abhor each other.? But there are records too of many pleasant 
meetings, of many feasts and fires in Hall. Every year, on the 
vigil of St. Edmund, the r9th November, there is the election of

on to livings : in August 1496 we read of one Master ‘‘ promoted ”’ 
to a beautiful benefice and another to a beautiful wife.2 Members | 
of the College go on pilgrimage to Compostella: one is ship- 
wrecked on the way. One retires to a Monastery. Others fling 
themselves too rashly into the world’s conflicts: the Register 
records their doings in the serious fight between North and 
South in August 1506.3 We have interesting notes on the 
Warden’s furniture, on the painting of the Library ceiling, on | 
woodwork in the Chapel and elsewhere. We have notes of high 
prices. Dear corn necessitates economy. In 1490 Portionists 
and servitors are condemned for a time to black bread. In 1500 
the Portionists are to have only the bread left over from the 
Fellows’ table.4 Their numbers are limited, and the Commoners 
are cut down to two. Yet in 1496 the net income of the College 
is put down at three hundred and forty pounds.5 Merton 
Commoners were for a long while closely restricted. In 1507 
their number was fixed at four, and at the same time battelers 
were abolished. They were clearly not regarded as a source of 
profit. A hundred years later we hear of twelve ‘‘ knights or 
gentlemen’s sons,’ but there is little disposition to welcome 
Commoners of a poorer class.6 The Register abounds in these 
homely and illuminating details. For all their troubles and 
irregularities the Fellows went on their way rejoicing, sharing 
as the spirit moved them in the changes of the times. Under the 
Tudors? they persisted as Catholics in singing the old hymns on 
Holy days round the Hall fire. But they feasted Elizabeth’s 
courtiers in the same Hall without demur. The College 
sympathies were not at first with the Reformers. Jewel, by that 
time a Fellow of Corpus, fled for his opinions, and formed the

Register. But one would be glad to have earlier notices. Wood thought 
the Merton election of 1557 was the last in Oxford (Ann. II, 136-7). 
But we have elections at St. John’s in 1577 and 1607, and at Magdalen 
in 1588. (See Dr. F. S. Boas’ University Drama in the Tudor Age, 3 sq.,

lowest possible estimate of the opponents whom he left behind. 
The old learning, the old traditions of teaching, held their place 
| as long as possible at Merton. When Bodley came there to 
lecture upon Greek, Elizabeth had been seated for some years 
upon the throne. 
Under that great Queen, however, the Reformed Faith 
triumphed at Merton as elsewhere. Parker’s nominee, John Man, 
met at first with strong resistance, and there may have been 
rejoicings in the College when he was sent by his Sovereign to 
represent her at Madrid. The King of Spain, Elizabeth said, 
with a humour hardly tolerable in a subject, had sent her a 
Goose-man 1: so she sent him a Man-goose in return. Man was 
turned out of Madrid for speaking ‘‘ unreverently ” of the Pope, 
and he died soon after his return to Oxford. But his successor, 
Thomas Bickley, was as uncompromising in his views as he. 
Sir Henry Savile, recommended as Warden by Lord Burghley 
in 1586, found Merton a Protestant College, and ruled it with 
distinction for nearly six and thirty years. Savile bore a great 
reputation and he made the most of his influence at Court. He 
secured the Provostship of Eton also—in complete disregard of 
the Eton Statutes—and he governed both Colleges with a strong 
hand. He was regarded as a miracle of learning. He was in 
fact an accomplished scholar and an accomplished host. He had 
the advantage of being ‘‘an extraordinary handsome and 
beautifull man.” But he “ could not abide witts,” ? and he did 
not like being interrupted in his studies. ‘‘I would I were a 
book too,” cried his wife once in desperation, ‘‘ and then you 
would a little more respect me.” To which an impudent 
bystander retorted, ‘Madam, you must then be an Almanack, 
that he might change every year.’ ? Besides the noble buildings 
which Savile left at Merton, the Savilian Professorships of 
Geometry and Astronomy perpetuate his name. 
Savile’s reign was a time of great prosperity. The early 
Elizabethan troubles were over. The anxieties of the Civil War 
were far ahead. But the fate of Henry Cuffe, a Greek Professor 
who took to politics and shared in the tragedy of the Earl of 
Essex, reminded Merton men that Oxford scholars were happiest 
1 Don Guzman de Silva, the Spanish Ambassador. Queen Elizabeth 
among other vagaries secured from Merton College a lease for 5,000 years 
_ of the Manor of Malden, which she assigned to Lord Arundel. But the 
College seems to have recovered its property after a struggle and a law-suit 
in 1623. (See the College Register, I1, 270, 283 and 295, and other books in 
the Bursar’s keeping.)

at home. The son of Elizabeth’s headstrong favourite came up to 
Merton after his father’s death. Under Savile probably John 
Earle was elected to a Fellowship, one of the wittiest and most 
lovable of churchmen.! Earle’s pictures of the old College butler 
domineering over freshmen, and of the young gentleman of fashion 
who came up to wear a gown, who was ready enough to play 
tennis and to learn the ways of taverns, but who could not endure 
“to be mistaken for a Scholler,’”’ must have been drawn from the 
Oxford of his day. Under Savile John Chamber, a friend of 
the Warden, established two more Postmasterships for Eton 
boys. Under Savile Bodley founded his great Library, left 
money to help poor scholars of Merton, and was buried with 
a sumptuous funeral in the Chapel. And under Savile, among 
other eminent recruits, the “‘ ever-memorable’’ John Hales was 
elected to a Fellowship in the College. 
Savile’s successor, Sir Nathaniel Brent, also played a large 
part in the Oxford of his day. Brent married a niece of Arch- 
bishop Abbot, and later “ took the Covenant and ran altogether 
with the rebellious rout.’’ In Brent’s time Laud’s Visitation 
for three years revealed the failings and tried the temper of 
the Fellows. Brent and Laud became bitter antagonists. The 
Archbishop thought the Warden ‘very foul.” The Warden 
thought the Archbishop no better than a Papist, and said so with 
some freedom at his trial. The Civil War broke out. The King 
and Queen made their Court at Oxford. The Queen’s chamber 
over the archway is shown at Merton still., Drill displaced the 
ancient disputations. Scholars served for the King—not always 
the most scholarly: ‘‘tota Academia morbo castrensi afflicta,” 
comments a Merton scribe. The College plate, weighing less 
perhaps than might have been expected, went to the Royal Mint. 
But Brent remained steadily in the camp of the Parliament. 
He was turned out of the Wardenship by the King’s command, 
and Harvey appointed, not without some protest, in his place.* 
When the siege was over Brent returned in triumph at the head 
1The facts are not quite clear. Dr. Henderson (97) dates Earle’s 
election as Fellow of Merton 1621: Mr. Brodrick (281-2) dates it 1619: 
Wood (Athena, ed. Bliss, III, 716) dates it 1620, and Earle’s B.A. degree 
1619 (Fasti, ed. Bliss, pt. I, 386). None of these dates can be reconciled 
with the assertion in D.N.B. that he was the John Earles who matricu- 
lated at Christ Church in June 1619. (See Clark, Register, II, ii, 375.) 
2 See Earle’s Micro-cosmographie (Arber reprint, 37-8 and 44-5). 
* Chamber was an Elizabethan Fellow. So was Thomas Jessop, who 
left money to double the allowances of these scholars. 
‘Peter Turner of Merton, a strong Royalist, headed the protest. 
(See the second volume of the College Register, 357-9.) A page or two 
earlier in this volume (355) is a blunt, pathetic entry under January

of the Parliamentary Commission. Three Merton Fellows sat 
upon it with him, Edward Reynolds, Corbet and Cheynell, and 
the College became for a time the headquarters of the Parlia- 
mentary party in Oxford. Merton in fact took the lead 
in establishing the new system. More than two-thirds of its 
members submitted,? and it suffered comparatively little from the 
great political change. 
But the Revolution moved too fast for Brent. The Indepen- 
dents triumphed, and in 1651 Goddard, Cromwell’s physician, 
was made Warden in his place. Goddard represented the 
University in the Little Parliament. His rule was a period of 
strenuous recovery. Grave studies were accompanied by fresh 
traditions of discipline and prayer. When the Presbyterians 
recovered power, Edward Reynolds, twice nominated Dean of 
Christ Church by the Parliament, became Warden for a short 
time in 1660. But the Restoration soon brought other standards. 
Sir Thomas Clayton, forced on the College in spite of strong 
protest in 1661, ruled it indifferently for over thirty years. It 
was a time of lax conduct and lax administration. One shrewd 
but shrewish critic, who knew Clayton at close quarters, con- 
demned him as impudent, lascivious, irreligious, “the very 
lol-poop of the University, the common subject of every lam- 
poon.”’? And among the old celibate traditions Lady Clayton’s 
pretensions were ‘‘a scandall and an abomination.” Anthony 
Wood had reason enough to mark his contemporaries’ failings, 
as he pored over his notes and researches in his lonely study at 
Postmasters’ Hall. 
The original site of the College included roughly a rectangle 
between the Town Wall on the South and St. John Baptist Street * 
on the North. There was one plot West of the Church. There 
were three plots with houses on them East of it. And further 
East Nun Hall was rented from the Nuns of Littlemore, and the 
“poor boys’”’ at an early date lodged in it. As time went on 
this property was enlarged. Before the thirteenth century was 
over, the College had possessions on the North side of St. John 
Street. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries it not only 
increased its holdings there. It acquired lands and tenements 
1 See the replies made to the Visitors in May 1648, and Prof. Burrows’ 
estimate that 15 were expelled and 39 sooner or later submitted (Register 
of Visitors, 80-3 and 520 sq.). But it is difficult to be certain of the 
figures. William Berkeley, afterwards Governor of Virginia, was among 
the sufferers. So were able Professors like Peter Turner and John Greaves. 
Another conspicuous Royalist from Merton, Sir Richard Browne, John 
Evelyn’s father-in-law, represented Charles I and Charles II in Paris 
from 1641 to 1660.

to the West of the Chapel, where now Corpus Christi stands. 
And it acquired or leased various old Halls, or the sites of them, 
running East’ to the turning of the City Wall. Of these St. 
Alban Hall was the most important. It adjoined Nun Hall, 
which it presently annexed. The garden of St. Alban Hall 
became the Warden’s garden in 1444.1 Of the College buildings 
tradition declares that the Hall was first built in the Founder’s 
lifetime. At any rate the big door with the famous iron-work on 
it dates from very early years, and the steps of the Hall are 
mentioned in 1304. Henry VIII’s day made improvements in 
it. A high porch was added under Queen Elizabeth. Squalid 
ruins? are spoken of before the end of the Civil War. The seven- 
teenth century left it still a plain, unlovely building, with two 
louvres above and three windows on each side. But changes in 
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries have remodelled the 
Hall of Merton since. : 
Old as the Hall is, however, the beautiful Choir of the Chapel, 
which rose on the site of the earlier Church of St. John, has a 
more certain claim to rank.as the most venerable monument which 
any of the Oxford Colleges can show.* There is nothing of the 
same date in University or City to compare with its grand East 
window and its early Decorated work. The transepts with their 
Perpendicular windows—two of especial beauty looking North 
and West—were for the most part added later. They may have 
been begun in the thirteenth century, but they were dedicated 
in 1424. The nave, once planned, it seems, was never built.® 
The massive and imposing Bell Tower, with its peal of bells, was 
1 Of the early history of St. Alban Hall we know little. The College 
rented it for years from the Littlemore and bought it in 1549. Some 
of its buildings are attributed to Warden Panis, The street front was 
rebuilt at the end of the sixteenth century. I have followed Dr. Hender- 
son’s account of the College site, which he has very carefully studied, 
though it does not on all points agree with Mr. Brodrick’s or with 
Dr. Clark’s. See Dr. Henderson’s plans and notes (11-12 and 57— 
62). His chapters on the College buildings in Part II of his History 
are full of interesting detail. Loggan’s map shows the College about 
1675. 
2“ Situ et ruinis squalida ’”’ (Henderson, 243). 
8 But some relics of St. Frideswide’s would of course be older, and 
there may be older fragments embedded in the Magdalen walls. 
4 Dr. Henderson (196-201) gives reasons for dating it mainly about 
1294-97, and with this good architectural opinion agrees. (See the 
Archeological Journal, II, 137-44; and on the claims of the Hall to be 
earlier see Proceedings of Oxford Architect. Soc., N.S., vols. I and II.) 
Dr. Henderson’s chapter on the Chapel should be studied, and Mf. Grinling’s 
paper, already cited, on the glass. 
® Dr. Henderson is inclined to admit (205-6) that the abandonment of 
the nave at Merton was due to the example of New College.

completed about 1451.1 A great Rood Loft was constructed * 
and Choir stalls presented in the days of Henry VII. Some of 
the stained glass in the West window dates from the same century, 
but there is older glass in the windows of the Choir. The splen- 
dour of the East window dominates it all. A new organ was 
bought for thirty pounds in 1633, and marble paving appeared 
soon after. Wood gives in detail a description of the monuments 
set in his day against the walls of the Chapel, including one to 
John Earle, and one to Thomas Bodley, with the emblems of his 
Library about him, and one to Henry Savile, with Angels presiding 
and Fame trumpeting above. Some of those on the floor of the 
Ante-Chapel were broken by a fall of the roof in 1655—what else 
could be expected under a Usurper? Thievish workmen stole 
the brasses. But some beautiful specimens of the fourteenth and 
fifteenth centuries remain.? In 1657 the bells were recast. Wood 
criticised their tone, though he had heard them ringing gladly as 
he returned from one of his May ramblesjin the country-side. 
After the Restoration they were recast once more. Repairs and 
alterations, new paving and new wainscoting, beautified the fine 
simplicity of the Chapel. And later still the Stuart changes also 
disappeared. 
Close beside the Chapel were the Sacristy, used in turn perhaps 
as chapel, vestry, brew-house,* and the Treasury, “a very old 
and particular piece of stone-work’’ with a massive, high-pitched 
roof. Tradition, recalling the purchases of Walter de Merton, has 
ingeniously tried to identify the Treasury with the counting-house 
of Jacob the Jew. East of the Chapel and fronting on the street 
were the tenements which grew into the front quadrangle. The 
Hall lay on the South side of the square. The gateway with the 
tower over it at the North-west corner was built by Warden 
Rodeborne in 1418,5 when men’s hearts were still full of pride 
for Agincourt. But William of Wykeham’s example at New 
College had perhaps more to do with its plan. Loggan shows it 
two and a half centuries later, with a central window flanked by 
statues of Henry III and Walter de Merton, and with a curious 
1 But Mr. Brodrick points out (14) that a large outlay on the “ cam- 
panile ’’ is mentioned in the Bursars’ rolls for 1330~1, and the lower arches 
of the tower are very early work. 
2In 1486. (See the Indenture printed from the Bursars’ books, 
Archeological Journal, II, 181-2.) It was replaced by an oak screen in 
1671 (Henderson, 211). 
8 See Vallance (Old Colls. of Oxford, App. I). 
«The Sacristy dates from 1311: it was not used as a brew-house till 
1827. The Treasury is some years older. The Sacristy may have been 
used for services and meetings. In the seventeenth century a case of 
suicide seems to have been buried there.

old piece of carved stone-work above, said to be a relic of the early 
church which preceded the Chapel. The rest-of the North front 
was rebuilt just after the Armada, and about 1631 a new building 
was added West of the entrance gate. At the East and South- 
east end of this quadrangle was the Warden’s House, with the 
archway adjoining, mainly the work of Sever and Fitzjames. 
South of the Chapel lay the Little or Old Quadrangle, the oldest 
of all Oxford College Courts. On its South and West sides were 
the windows of the Library, built in 1377-78, but not the first 
Library which the College possessed.? The North and East 
sides are probably still older, and may date from the beginning 
of the fourteenth century, not much after the Chapel Choir. 
As early as the year 1300 we hear about new chambers.® ‘“‘ Mob 
Quad,” or, as Wood once calls it, ‘“‘the bachelors’ quadrangle” 
had, like the other quadrangle, its attic ‘‘ cock-lofts” and its 
famous rooms.* 
The chief glory of this small quadrangle, overshadowed but — 
not eclipsed by the grandeur of the tower, was the Library built 
by Bishop Rede. Within a few years of the foundation of the 
College Archbishop Patcham had ordered the works of Papias, 
Huguitio and Brito to be chained to an honest table for students © 
to consult.5 But Merton men demanded more stimulating fare ; 
and catalogues of the fourteenth century, still in part preserved, — 
give interesting lists of works on theology, philosophy and 
mathematics. Books could from the first be borrowed freely. 
They were taken out in considerable numbers at periodic “ elec- 
tions’’ or distributions of books.* They were kept for the most 
1 This piece of sculpture is now lower down, just over the entrance 
(Henderson, 251). 
2 Bishop Hobhouse (quoted by Mr. Brodrick, 16) has noted a reference 
to the Library in Jan. 1355, which clearly refers to a room. (See also 
Henderson, 227.) 
8 Mr. Brodrick (15) refers to Bursars’ rolls of 1306 ; but Dr. Henderson 
(198) gives details of the earlier date, 1300. 
4E.g. the “‘ Oxoniam Quare’’ room, named from a distich inserted 
in the windows some 400 years ago (Wood’s Life, II, 249, n.) : 
“Oxoniam quare venisti premeditare 
Nocte dieque cave tempus consumere prave.” 
Dr. Henderson has found no reference to the name Mob Quadrangle earlier 
than 1797 (255). But in the eighteenth century it was in use. 
5 See his Injunctions (cap. 3, Statutes of Colls., Merton, 41). 
® 136 were so distributed in 1372, 185 in 1410, and 238 in 1451. The 
two earliest Merton Library catalogues were made about 1320-40 and 
1360. The first contained some 80 books, including several translations 
from Aristotle, under Mathematics Euclid, Ptolemy’s A/magest and Plato’s 
Timeus, and under Grammar Priscian and Boethius. The second con- 
tained 250 books, all more or less theological, 43 volumes with glosses on 
parts of the Bible, 16 copies of the Sentences, 42 volumes of Augustine, 
Aquinas, Scotus, etc., and authors like’ Boethius, Josephus and Bede.

part in chests till a Library was ready to receive them: and 
even the earliest Library may have shown the beginnings of those 
lateral partitions with desks attached, of which Merton is said 
to have given the first example to the world.t Since Bishop 
Rede’s day the long, low rooms with the lancet windows have 
seen important alterations. A graceful barrel-roof was added in 
1502-3. In the seventeenth century the South room was 
remodelled. The old book-cases were replaced: only one half- 
case of the original fittings survives. Great dormer windows 
were formed in the roof. Panelling, plaster-work and carving 
were inserted,? lit by the mellow colours of the window at the 
end. An endowment for the Librarian was provided in 1672. 
The old chains for books were not finally removed till a hundred 
and twenty years later. They did not prevent an angry Librarian 
in the eighteenth century from throwing volumes out of the 
window. Undergraduates were not admitted till the nineteenth 
century was well advanced. Many a gift since Bishop Rede’s 
has enriched the store which the Reformation plundered. Thirty- 
eight volumes which belonged to the Bishop,* beautiful manu- 
scripts of the works of Ockham, an astrolabe which Chaucer 
might have studied when writing on the subject for his boy, and 
Caxton’s first edition of the Canterbury Tales,‘ still remain 
among the treasures of a Library, which yields to some in 
splendour, to none in ancient fame, in quiet beauty, in its dim 
charm of stateliness and peace. 
Fitzjames and Savile are prominent among the builders of 
the College, but Savile has left the happiest memorials. Besides 
The only classical MS. added in the fifteenth century seems to be a Seneca 
given by Warden Fitzjames. Of the MSS. mentioned in these early 
catalogues, which are earlier than Bishop Rede’s great contribution, only 
24remain. The habit of using fragments of old MSS. for bindings—even 
a tenth-century fragment of Jerome was so used—may account for some 
of the losses. I owe these details to a lecture on Merton Library by 
Mr. P. S. Allen, which I hope may be published soon. 
1 See Mr. Brodrick’s comment (16) on the “‘ palatia librariz ” of 1355. 
Mr. Gibson thinks that a double row of lecterns, back to back at right- 
angles to the wall, may have preceded the stall-bookcases with desks. 
2 The great dates in the history of the Library, says Dr. Henderson, 
in his chapter on the subject (235), were 1377-8, 1502-3, 1623-4 and 1641. 
In the second volume of the College Register (£. 343) there is an interesting 
reference to purchases of Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Arabic and Persian books 
with money given by Mr. Allen in 1640, 
* This is the figure given me by Mr. P. S, Allen as probable—three 
more than Coxe allows. Rede gave ninety-nine manuscripts, but the rest 
have gone ; one of them (Digby, 216) has found its way to the Bodleian. 
4On Caxton’s earliest editions of the Canterbury Tales see Gordon 
Duff (Early Printed Books, 129 sq., and The Printers, Stationers of London, 
etc. in the Fifteenth Century, 7). Lewis Chaucer’s astrolabe and the Merton 
astrolabe are alleged to be of about the same date. (See later, p. 190.)

  132 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
the new street fronts to the main quadrangle and to St. Alban 
Hall, Savile was responsible for a new quadrangle to the South. 
Contemporary with the beautiful buildings of Wadham, and 
mingling, as those did, classic forms and decorations with the 
Oxford Gothic style, the graceful range of Savile’s buildings 
looks out across the meadows to the Thames. Here the senior 
Fellows were lodged, in the ‘‘ very good and pleasant apartments ”’ 
which Wood praises. Here after the Restoration a spacious 
chamber was converted into the earliest Oxford Common Room. 
To the East were the gardens, less formal perhaps than Loggan 
represents them, with fine sycamores already planted and with 
Lady Clayton’s summer-house conspicuous upon the wall. To 
the West lay the grove, still undefaced with buildings. No 
Vandals in the seventeenth century proposed to destroy the Little 
Quadrangle or to sweep a portion of Bishop Rede’s Library away.? 
The great Warden’s energy was unceasing. He set up a new 
monument to Walter de Merton in Rochester Cathedral. He 
induced the College to give timber for Bodley’s Library and books 
for its shelves. The College may well pay tribute, as it does, 
to the “ lasting memory of his benefits and virtues,” for to Savile’s 
taste and generous discretion no small part of the dignity which 
stamps it, of the beauty which enfolds it still, is due. 
Other Houses for students were founded in thirteenth-century 
Oxford, which have no place-in the list of Colleges to-day. The 
great Monastic Orders soon realised the importance of sending 
their young brethren to the University to be trained. The Abbey 
which Edmund of Cornwall founded at Rewley in 1280 or 1281 
was intended as a place of study for Cistercian monks. The 
Benedictines of the Southern Province, who had Houses at 
Abingdon and Eynsham a few miles away, were not slow to adopt 
the same idea. In 1283 John Giffard, a Gloucestershire magnate, 
1 The Wadham buildings date from 1610 to 1613. Savile’s building 
was practically finished in 1610, “ circa festti Michaelis ” says the Register 
of the College. Battlements were added in 1622. (See also Henderson 
259-60.) On the style of these buildings and of the Schools Quadrangle 
see Sir T. G. Jackson’s delightful study of Wadham College (especially 
I-3 and 125-7). Savile’s influence on contemporary architecture in 
Oxford may have been greater than we know, and Thomas Holt, the 
master-carpenter who served him, was conspicuous among the Oxford 
builders of his day. 
2 Both these proposals were agreed to by the College in 1861! Mr. 
Butterfield seems to have been prepared for either. (See the resolutions 
quoted by Dr. Henderson, 262.) 
* But it did not succeed as a studium, owing to the opposition of the 
Cistercian Abbots. (See Little, Eng. Hist. Review, Jan. 1893, pp. 83-4.) 
Cistercian students had no definite headquarters in Oxford till St. Bernard’s 
College was built.

  THE EARLIEST COLLEGES 133 
who had abducted a widow of rank and importance without his 
Sovereign’s leave, founded, for the health of his soul and his 
lady’s, a cell for thirteen Benedictine monks drawn from the great 
House of St. Peter’s at Gloucester. The cell amid the water- 
meadows North-west of the town soon developed into a Bene- 
dictine College. Chapters of the Order held in 1290 and ragr 
sanctioned a more extensive plan. At Gloucester College—the 
name still lingers in a neighbourhood whose glory has decayed!— 
students from other Benedictine Houses gathered, representing 
the famous Abbeys of the Order, Malmesbury and St. Albans, 
Westminster and Winchcombe,? Canterbury, Glastonbury and 
many more. Malmesbury claimed special rights over the College, 
based on a later grant of the property, obtained, not to say 
extorted, by the Abbot from John Giffard in his declining years. 
Of sixty-five Benedictine Priories and Abbeys, thirty-eight, it 
seems, can be definitely connected with the College, and we know 
that fifteen of them at one time or another had houses or lodgings 
within its walls. On the part played in College affairs by some 
of the great Abbeys, especially by St. Albans, we have a good deal 
of information. Of the share taken by others we know little. 
Some of the students from various Abbeys seem to have betaken 
themselves for a time to Canterbury College. Some were clearly 
1 But there seems to be no evidence for the tradition that Gilbert de 
Clare, the great thirteenth-century Earl of Gloucester, had a house here, 
2 A house in Oxford belonging to Winchcombe is mentioned in a Bull 
of Pope Alexander III, confirming that Monastery’s possessions in 1175 
(Dugdale, Monasticon, ed. 1846, II, 303). But there is nothing in the Bull 
to indicate that this house was a place of study, as Stevens (Additions 
to Dugdale’s Monast. I, 337-41) suggests. Stevens gives an account of 
Gloucester College, but the most valuable account is to be found in the 
early chapters of the History of Worcester College by Mr. Daniel and 
Mr. Barker, to which I am much indebted. 
3“ Camere.’ The first official proposal by the Benedictines of the 
Canterbury Province for the establishment of a College at Oxford was 
apparently made in 1275. Subsequent Chapters developed the idea. 
But it was not till 1337 that the Constitution of Benedict XII, amended 
later, organised the system, and required all Benedictine Houses, including 
those in the Province of York, to send one in twenty of their members to a 
studium generale. The number of Benedictines at Gloucester College at 
any time is difficult to estimate. The authors of Worcester College (Chap. I1) 
think it may have averaged 100. But I doubt if the average was nearly so 
high. The only list we have, one of 32 in 1537, can hardly be taken as 
representative. More Benedictine students, no doubt, went to Oxford 
than to Cambridge. But Durham had its own College. Canterbury broke 
away. Westminster generally sent 2 students to Gloucester College ; 
some Houses sent one, some none at all. In 1432 Bishop Gray released 
Eynsham from the obligation for five years (Visitation of Lincoln, ed. 
A. H. Thompson, I, 56). In 1440, we are told, one Abbey has sent none 
for six years, another none for seven, another none for twelve (Worc. Coll. 
61). See also Bishop Pearce of Worcester’s Monks of Westminster,

134 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
turbulent and difficult to rule. But it is clear that for several 
generations a limited number of monastic scholars flowed to this 
Benedictine settlement at Oxford, and that they lived there under 
one superior, but subject always to the authority of their own 
Houses. If the young monks were glad to go to Oxford, their 
superiors were not always so ready to send them, and in spite of 
the wealth of the Abbeys there were not infrequently difficulties 
in regard to funds. 
But the larger spirits took a wider view. When the first 
Benedictine of Gloucester College received his degree as a Doctor 
of Divinity, monks and prelates of the Order flocked to Oxford 
to celebrate the occasion, and a deputation arrived from St. 
Peter’s Abbey, Gloucester, with a cavalcade of a hundred horses 
to do honour to a colleague who had done honour to them all. 
The Benedictines were not unwilling to spend money on such 
occasions, and in other ways also they encouraged their students. 
They gave them an instructor in theology. They taught them 
to preach both in Latin and in English. But they forbade them 
to mix freely with the seculars outside. In the fourteenth and 
fifteenth centuries more than one Abbot of St. Albans showed 
himself a good friend to the House at Oxford. Thomas de la 
Mare, whose rule in his great Convent covered nearly half a 
century, sent up more than the required number of his monks 
to be “‘ educated in all kinds of knowledge.’’ He gave money 
freely for their lodging and support. He prevented Archbishop 
Courtenay from visiting the College. His successor built the 
first stone house for his students, next door to that of the Norwich 
monks. The next Abbot made the house of the St. Albans men 
the finest in the College. And John of Whethamstede, a famous 
fifteenth-century prelate,* was Prior of the College before he passed 
on to govern the Abbey. He enriched and completed the 
buildings which his predecessors had begun. He built the 
Library and the garden wall. A Chapel and a Refectory were 
already built or building. Abbot John noted that in one respect 
at any rate the Chapel resembled Solomon’s Temple, in having 
taken forty years to build. He also gave three silver salt-cellars 
to his students, and increased the payments which they drew. 
Another fifteenth-century Prior of the College, Edmund Kirton, 
was an active member of the University, and helped to secure 
for it a grant from Benedictine funds. Abbot Millyng, who

Annals and the two volumes of the Abbot’s Registers, all edited with 
introductions by Mr. H. T. Riley in the Chron. Monast. S. Alban. (Rolls 
Series) : also D.N.B.

thezprincipal Chapel (Worc. Coll. 47).

THE EARLIEST COLLEGES 135 
sheltered Elizabeth Woodville in an hour of peril, was a student 
of Gloucester College. One resident at least figured among the 
earliest Reformers. Feckenham, the last Abbot of Westminster, 
was among the College’s last recruits. But Feckenham belonged 
to an age which was already passing. The Reformation, which 
destroyed the Benedictine Abbeys, inevitably swept away the 
Benedictine Colleges. Yet the old quarters of the monks of West- 
minster and Abingdon and part of the lodging of the Gloucester 
monks remain. 
Meanwhile the Benedictines of the Northern Province had also 
established a colony in Oxford. The ground chosen was a site 
of some ten acres outside the North wall, where now the lime-set 
lawns of Trinity are spread. Here in 1286 “arable londs. . . 
in Bewmounte” and “ voide groundes beside Peralowse Hall in 
Horsemonger-strete ’’ were secured from the Abbess of Godstow. 
The Convent of St. Frideswide and other owners contributed 
plots of ground.1’ And here the Priors of the great Abbey at 
Durham set about building their students a permanent home.? 
Edward III became the patron of the little College, in gratitude 
for a victory which again seated a Balliol on the Scottish throne.*® 
Students came. A theological lecturer was talked of, though the 
plan apparently fell through. Richard de Bury, the book-loving 
Bishop of Durham, intended but failed to bequeath to it the 
greatest library of the age. Bishop Hatfield, however, magni- 
ficent as Bishop, Minister and builder, dying in 1381, succeeded 
in leaving it a handsome benefaction, and with these funds the 
little settlement was endowed and organised afresh. Eight 
student monks, with a Warden among them, and eight secular 
students in grammar and philosophy were to form the community 
in future. The secular students were placed on an inferior footing 
to the monks, but there is no evidence that they rebelled against 
this. The monks were the Fellows, the seculars were Scholars 
or “boys.” The Fellows, visitors from Durham residing for the 
time in Oxford, received liberal allowances for commons, clothes 
and other expenses. They had plate and vestments and even 
1 The title-deeds are still at Durham, and among their seals is the seal 
of St. Mary Magdalen Parish, bearing the star and crescent of Richard I, 
who was born there. Perilous Hall was on the site of Kettell Hall. I 
owe these details and others to the first chapter of Dr. Blakiston’s History 
of Trinity College and to the same writer’s article on Some Durham College 
Rolls (Collectanea, III). 
2 Hugh de Derlington, about 1287, is said to have sent students to 
Oxford. Richard de Houton, about 1290, apparently began to build. 
But he must have been much occupied with the vicissitudes of his own 
career.

fires in their rooms. Indeed the comfort that they lived in 
tempted them sometimes to forget to whom it all was due. 
Early in the fifteenth century new buildings were erected. 
The College was approached then, and for centuries later, by a 
long road, close to the borders of Balliol, running Northwards 
from the gate. A gate erected in 1397, at a cost of four pounds, 
lasted till 1733. The oldest chambers lay to the West of the 
entrance. To the East of it a new Chapel was begun in 1406, 
to replace the Oratory licensed some three-quarters of a century 
before. The Refectory lay further North, on the West side of 
the small quadrangle or ‘‘ Quadrantt.”’ The buttery and kitchen 
and other chambers were beyond. The Warden’s chamber was 
on the North side of the court, the Library and other chambers 
on the East.1_ The little Black Monks in the Library windows 
kneeling to the Saints—Becket’s full-length figure shows his 
murderer’s dagger still sticking in his head—are not needed to 
testify that Trinity possesses the old Benedictine inheritance 
to-day. Durham College produced some well-known Wardens. 
It received from time to time distinguished guests. It let its 
spare rooms freely to strangers,? and took in lodgers from other 
Benedictine Abbeys in the North. Like other Colleges it had 
financial troubles, deficits not always made good by fresh bequests. 
In the fifteenth century its numbers fell off and its revenues 
declined. In the reign of Henry VIII the net income was put at 
one hundred and twenty-two pounds odd. The Warden had a 
salary of twelve pounds. The seven Fellows took eight pounds 
apiece. And the rest went in general expenses, in pay for the 
Scholars, in alms for the Friars and the poor.® 
The See of Durham played a great part in the history of three 
of the earliest Colleges at Oxford, and Durham College came near 
to inheriting from Richard de Bury the richest literary bequest 
of the time. That picturesque prelate made it a rule never to 
refuse to buy a book ; and perhaps in consequence of this amiable 
failing his library had to go to pay his debts. He loved his 
collection better than gold. He wrote of it with eloquent and 
1 The “‘ fayre Library, well desked and well flowred,”’ cost £42 in 1417. 
The authority for these early buildings and their interesting details is 
The Situation and View of Durham College, drawn up apparently after the 
Dissolution, and now preserved at the Record Office (Rentals and Surveys. 
Roll 548). Dr. Blakiston has used this Roll in his Trinity College (19-28). 
But it seems to have come to the Record Office not from the Augmentation 
Office but from the Treasury of the Receipt of the Exchequer (Chapter 
House, Westminster) together with other documents relating to the 
foundation of Christ Church. 
2E.g. to Gilbert Kymer, the well-known Chancellor of the University.

of poor Colleges like University and Balliol in their early days.

| lively fancy. His bedroom, they said, was strewn with precious 
volumes— masters who teach without birch or ferule or harsh 
words.”’! And the passion was genuine, though Petrarch, who 
once cross-questioned him at Avignon, suspected that he knew 
more of the outside than of the inside of his books. The Bishop 
had one fault. He dreaded the influence of the “ biped beast ” 
named woman, who was jealous implacably of clerks and students, 
and was apt to turn upon them and drive them out of doors. 
But if her influence could be avoided, like the asp or the basilisk, 
he saw Oxford taking the place of Paris, that ‘‘ Paradise of the 
world.” The little College at Oxford missed the chance of this 
great legacy, but it collected its own library, and for many 
generations it held onits way. Like other settlements of monkish 
students, it was doomed to vanish when the Reformation came. 
Anne Boleyn proved too strong for her opponents. The biped 
beast and her influence over the heart of a King prevailed. But 
these settlements, while they lasted, helped materially to bring 
the monasteries into touch with Oxford life. Their discipline 
perhaps did something for the cause of order. And, different as 
they were from other Colleges, their corporate traditions, no 
doubt, tended to strengthen the Collegiate system and ideal.?

CHAPTER V 
THE MEDIZZVAL UNIVERSITY AT WORK 
ITH the close of the Barons’ War and the foundation 
W of the earliest Colleges, a new period of prosperity 
for the University began. Oxford had taken her place 
beside Paris among the most famous seats of Western learning. 
She claimed indeed with superb assumption that Paris was an 
imitator if not a daughter of her own.! Students flowed to her 
from every quarter. The tireless scholars of the Middle Ages 
were not content to study at a single University. They travelled 
far afield in search of teachers—‘ wont to roam around the world 
. . . till much learning made them mad.” ? They relied upon 
the comradeship of learners. They were franked by the common 
language of educated men. The Schoolmen of Oxford in the 
early fourteenth century became the leaders of European thought. 
Dante himself, it has been asserted, listened to her lecturers and 
wandered in her streets? Her numbers were considerable. 
Youths of all ranks and conditions swelled them—from fine 
young gentlemen under the King’s patronage to needy boys as 
portionless as any begging Friar. The Halls and Inns increased. 
A crowd of clients sought the University’s protection and found 
a livelihood within its precincts. Booksellers,‘ illuminators, 
1 Edward II was persuaded to claim that Englishmen had originated 
the University of Paris, and in 1296 the Bishop of Lincoln put forward 
a hardly less audacious plea. (See Linc. Epis. Reg. Sutton, mem. 141b, 
and Twyne, II, 23.) 
2 So said a monk of Froidmont in the twelfth century. He added that 
in Paris they sought liberal arts, ‘‘ in Orleans authors, at Salerno gallipots, 
at Toledo demons, and in no place decent manners” (J. A. Symonds, 
Wine, Women and Song, 17). 
* This tradition hassome support. (See Lyte, 89-91 and the references 
quoted there.) Giovanni da Serravale, Bishop of Fermo, who knew 
Robert Hallam (once Chancellor of Oxford) at the Council of Constance, 
wrote a Latin commentary on the Divina Commedia apparently in 1416, 
and in the preamble he twice states that Dante studied at Oxford. Mr. 
Gladstone defended this view in the Nineteenth Century for June 1892. 
But Dr. Paget Toynbee, who has allowed me to consult him, does not 
accept it. 
“Dean Rashdall (I, 415) points out the distinction between the 
“Librarius ”’ at Paris, who sold books for private individuals, and the 
“ Stationarius,” who employed writers to produce them, and then either 
sold or lent them out on hire.

THE MEDIZVAL UNIVERSITY AT WORK 139 
parchment-makers, binders, writers and copyists, surgeons, 
barbers and apothecaries, mingled with other followers, not of 
one sex only, whose position was less assured. But not even the 
inclusion of servants and dependents can render credible the 
estimates which some medieval writers give—the sixty thousand 
students of the past whom Wycliffe spoke of, the thirty thousand 
whom a celebrated Archbishop, almost his contemporary, had 
known at Oxford in his youth,! the fifteen thousand whom 
William of Rishanger reckoned in the days of Henry III, or 
even the six thousand whom “ Armachanus” was prepared to 
be content with in 1357. Wycliffe was on solider ground when 
he admitted that in his time the scholars of Oxford numbered 
less than three thousand. After the Great Pestilence, counting 
students only, he might safely have put them at less than two. 
In the great riot of 1298, which few of the scholars or their 
dependents would have missed, three thousand clerks took part 
according to one version, and fifteen hundred according to 
another.2. The Crown’s demand for fifteen hundred psalters in 
granting a confirmation of Charters in 1315 suggests that fifteen 
hundred was approximately the official estimate of Oxford 
scholars.? And later on, in 1438, the University declared in a 
petition to Convocation that of all its reputed multitudes in old 
days hardly a thousand then remained. 
Through all the turbulence of medieval Oxford the old ideals 
of simplicity and austerity survived. Philosophers indeed clung 
1 Gascoigne’s statement to the same effect (Loci e Libro Veritatum, ed. 
Rogers, 202) was probably based on that of Archbishop Fitz-Ralph of 
Armagh. For Wycliffe’s statements see De Ecclesia (ed. Loserth, Wyclif 
Soc., 374), and for William of Rishanger’s his Chronicon (ed. Halliwell, 
Camden Soc., 22). The best discussion of the subject is in Chap. XIII of 
Dr. Rashdall’s second volume: but even his estimates may possibly be 
too high. In the thirteenth century, when the numbers at Oxford may 
have been highest, only a small proportion of beneficed clergy seem to have 
been University men. The Rotuli of Bishop Hugh Wells (Cant. and York 
Soc. I, xiii) show that in the Archdeaconry of Oxford out of 156 pres- 
entations made in 16 years only 13 were described as “ Magistri.” In the 
fifteenth century, when one considers the population after the Black 
Death, the small area of Oxford, the small numbers who took M.A. degrees, 
the small numbers in the Colleges and Halls, especially before Magdalen 
was founded—it is possible that 450 would more than cover the students 
in Halls and 150 the monks and Friars—one understands the depression 
of which the University complained. On the other hand Sir James 
Ramsay’s estimate (Eng. Hist. Rev., Oct. 1903) seems to me too low.

to the belief that a place of study ought not to be too healthy, 
that the mens sana depended little on the corpore sano, that 
weakness of body often led to strength of mind.1 Of poverty 
the students as a whole had neither love nor fear. The University 
had at first no endowments, and as years passed only a few small 
grants came to its aid. It had for long no buildings of its own. 
Its Masters taught in hired schools, hired from the Monasteries 
or other landlords. Under Edward II they petitioned the Crown 
for land near Smith Gate to build Schools on, as Masters and 
scholars were increasing so fast.2 Its members dwelt for the 
most part in hired lodgings. Its meetings and ceremonies took 
place in borrowed churches. The Faculty of Arts, sometimes 
called the Black Congregation, had their own separate meetings 
at St. Mildred’s, on the site of the future Lincoln College. But 
the chief business of the University was done in St. Mary’s, where 
Congregations of all the Faculties assembled.? There its degrees 
were granted. There, as time went on, its slender revenues, 
its treasures and its manuscripts were stored.4 That venerable 
church has passed through many changes, Its memorials of 
Saxon and Norman days have vanished. It was not till near the 
end of the thirteenth century that its great tower rose above 
the High Street, and its beauties as we know them began.® It 
was not till 1320 that Bishop Cobham of Worcester founded the 
Old House of Congregation; a two-storeyed building on the 
North-east side, and thus gave the University a habitation of 
its own: and even now probably few undergraduates who pass 
that time-worn corner remember that the first dwelling-place of 
the University is there. It was not till some years later that the

2 See Collectanea (III, 10). The Canon Law School was University 
property before 1279: but it was let with the Hall attached to it. Some 
ten houses in Oxford were given to the University in the thirteenth century, 
but they were let on lease (Med. Arch. I, 275). 
3 That is the Congregation of Regents (Congregatio minor), which sat 
in the Congregation House after it was built, and the Great Congregation 
of Regents and Non-Regents (Congregatio magna or plena) which met in 
St. Mary’s choir. To this larger body in the sixteenth century the term 
Convocatio came to be applied. 
4 Some of the earlier Chests were kept at St. Frideswide’s. But adecree 
of 1454 ordered their removal to St. Mary’s (Register of Convocation 
Aa, 83). 
5On St. Mary’s see Sir T. G. Jackson’s volume on The Church of 
St. Mary the Virgin, Oxford. The church was rebuilt as we know it in the 
fifteenth century, but the thirteenth-century tower remains, with the 
spire which was added soon after. It is possible that the church was 
also rebuilt when the tower was added. But it is perhaps more probable 
that it was rebuilt a hundred years earlier, in Richard I’s day: St. Hugh 
was a great builder. Even Sir T. Jackson, however, cannot speak 
positively, and evidence is wanting.

books which the Bishop had intended for the upper room in his 
new structure were carried off from Oriel, after a pretty quarrel, 
to found the earliest Library which the University could claim: 
and Oriel thought the claim a bad one still.1_ It was not till the 
following century that “‘ a long pile of stone building ” in Schools 
Street was provided by the Abbot of Oseney # as a permanent 
home for the Arts Schools, or that the noble Divinity School 
beyond it set a new tradition of splendour for the academic 
world. But the poverty of the University was one source of 
its strength. A corporate body without possessions to encumber 
it could laugh at fine and forfeiture. A community without 
habitations to relinquish was always free to migrate if its needs 
required. 
To the individual student not compelled, like the Franciscans, 
to eschew the temptations of riches, the advantages of poverty 
may have seemed less clear. It is evident that expenses at Oxford 
varied widely. The poorest students of all might seek a begging- 
license from the Chancellor, and eke out a living with charity 
which carried no discredit. Begging, though the Friars made 
it the fashion, had its disadvantages as a means of education, 
but many a penniless lad in the Middle Ages owed his learning 
to generous patrons or friends. Some, in the Colleges, ranked 
as servitors or battelers,4 performing certain menial duties and 
waiting on their betters before sitting down to dinner. Some 
were excused the customary charges, and graduated im forma 
pauperis without having to pay fees. But the great majority 
of students lived with some degree of comfort. John Balliol’s 
Scholars indeed had to make shift on eightpence weekly. But 
the Merton Scholars with fifty shillings a year were at first 
thought to have ample. At Exeter the early Scholars had only 
tenpence a week. At Oriel the weekly allowance for commons 
was raised in 1329 from a shilling to fifteen pence. New Col- 
lege in times of scarcity allowed as much as one and sixpence. 
Queen’s in the days of Edward III fixed a liberal maximum of 
1 The books were secured by the University about 1337. The Bishop, 
like other injudicious testators, disposed of more property than he 
possessed, and his books became the subject of a dispute, in which Adam de 
Brome, Rector of St. Mary’s and Founder of Oriel College, played a 
generous part. (See Collectanea, I, 62 sq. and Dr. Poole’s article on 
Cobham in D.N.B.)

two shillings. Two or three shillings a week could be made to 
cover all a student’s expenses: three shillings or three and 
sixpence could be made to do it well. Four or five shillings 
weekly seems to have sufficed even for young men who kept a 
tutor and a servant and who depended on the bounty of a 
King. In 1288 the Bishop of Hereford sent two lads to Oxford, 
whose expenses for forty weeks came to close on fourteen 
pounds. About the same time Edward I sent there two young 
gentlemen from Gascony, and allowed them thirty-five marks 
a year, something under twelve pounds each.1 The son of a 
prosperous London citizen in Edward III’s day spent two 
shillings weekly on his board, twenty-six shillings and eightpence 
a year on tuition, forty shillings on clothes and twenty shillings 
on sundries, making nine pounds, ten shillings and eightpence 
for his yearly charges, the equivalent perhaps of a hundred and 
eighty pounds to-day. The rents of rooms varied a good 
deal. In the records of the Chancellor’s Court in the fifteenth 
century we find a scholar’s room in Athelstan Hall charged 
at seven and sixpence a year, and a room in Lincoln College, 
belonging to a well-to-do Master, rated at thirteen shillings and 
fourpence.? The pay of servants was generally small, but per- 
quisites probably increased them. In the early days of Exeter 
College the Manciple received five shillings a term, the cook 
two shillings, the washerwoman one and threepence, and the 
barber a shilling. An early Tutor at New College received five 
shillings a year for each pupil. Fees were low and teaching 
cheap. The standards of living as a whole were frugal. But 
functions like Determination and Inception might involve heavy 
expenses. The costs for the average student were substantial, 
and a full course at Oxford lasted many a year.‘ 
The Chancellor’s and Proctors’ Books, treasured among the 
Archives of the University, yield innumerable glimpses of the 
conditions of medieval life. The first little collection of Statutes 
we possess seems to date from about the year 1275, and the 
Statutes in it are almost all concerned with the maintenance of 
order. But the majority of them reappear, with others of a 
similar nature, in the official records of the University, of which 
the most august and venerable is Registrum A, the Chancellor’s 
Book. The earliest portion of this celebrated Register is in a

hand which can hardly be dated much later than 1325.1 It is 
based on materials which were probably in existence before 1312. 
It seems likely that the need for codifying the University’s 
Statutes was suggested by the great quarrel with the Friars, 
Each Chancellor received this book on his accession, and made 
in it such entries as he pleased. Additions and interpolations 
followed later. Attempts to revive faded passages with oak galls 
have obliterated portions of the text. Even Chancellors were 
sometimes careless, and necessary records were too often omitted. 
In the fifteenth century the Proctors also had Books of their 
own. As time passed, the Chancellor’s Book was re-arranged 
and re-bound, with. little regard to regularity or method. In 
its present form it begins with a document of 1459, and takes 
us through an ecclesiastical calendar, a note of masses and a list 
of heresies, before reaching the belated preface. Transcripts of 
ordinances, charters and proceedings jostle each other in its 
pages, without reference to subject or to date. But with all its 
imperfections, the book’s interest is supreme. It has remained 
for centuries a code of almost immemorial customs, and for 
three hundred years it was the most authoritative record of the 
laws and liberties which the University possessed.* 
For the medieval student conditions, no doubt, altered, but 
altered less than might have been expected, between the days of 
Roger Bacon and the days of Erasmus. The boy who came up 
to Oxford from a country home, escorted sometimes by a carrier 
or “‘ fetcher,” to enter on his long course of University training, 
seems to have enjoyed in the early days at any rate a remarkable 
degree of freedom. Young, very young, as he often was, he 
chose the Master whose lectures he would attend, and was warned 
by the quidnuncs not to make his choice too quickly. He 
chose the Hall or Inn where he would lodge, or joined with 
other students who were hiring a Hall for themselves, and he 
afterwards took his share in electing the Principal, and even in 
1T am here following Mr. Gibson, whose work on the Statutes is of the 
first importance. As I write, Mr. Gibson’s book is not yet published, 
but he has given me access to his proofs and notes. (See also Appendix 
at the end of this volume.) 
? Nearly all the earlier Statutes in the Chancellor’s Book were printed 
by Mr. Anstey in Munimenta Academica, but the arrangement left much 
to be desired. Mr. Gibson, by examining the different handwritings, and 
by comparing the entries with the order in Registrum D (MS. Bodl. 337)— 
which is largely a transcript of the Chancellor’s Book, made probably 
about 1375, and the importance of which he was the first to point out— 
has been able to rearrange the contents, and especially the earliest Statutes, 
with a clearness not attained before. These two Registers, with the 
Junior Proctor’s Book (Registrum C, dating from 1407) and the Senior 
Proctor’s Book (Registvum B, dating from 1477), are the four chief 
authorities for the ancient Statutes of the University.

managing the business of the house. He shared also, no doubt, 
in the practical jokes which generally accompanied the initiation 
of a student, and which, little as we hear of them at Oxford, 
ancient custom almost everywhere excused. In the Roman 
Empire Justinian had intervened to stop them. In medieval 
Paris Statutes were needed to restrain them, to protect from 
extortion the ‘‘ Bejauni”’ or “ becs-jaunes,” the unfledged birds, 
at whom they were aimed. In seventeenth-century England 
Anthony Ashley Cooper headed a revolt against them,tand they are 
not likely to have been free from objection three centuries before. 
When installed in his room—which he often shared with 
a companion—the average student had comforts of his own, 
and, though floors were still bare except for rushes and windows 
often innocent of glass, these comforts increased as time went 
on. Chaucer’s scholar kept books and instruments of music. 
He had Aristotle at his bed-head, and many a song in “his 
merry throat.” The fifteenth-century inventories which remain 
of the goods of Masters and students give lists of clothes, of 
furniture and of other possessions not to be despised. There 
are manuscripts of the Schoolmen and the Fathers, Pope Gregory's 
Homilies and Anselm’s Cur Deus Homo. Boethius is there, and 
Priscian and Rabanus, books of Digests and Decretals, psalters 
and missals. Plato’s Tim@eus is mentioned, and Martial and 
Seneca and Ovid. Among household things bedding figures 
largely, not only mattresses and bolsters, sheets and blankets, 
but coverlets of green and yellow powdered with roses, or white 
and black with birds and flowers. Beds and heavy furniture 
were, no doubt, often hired. Truckle-beds were used by junior 
students. Boys slept sometimes two together. Cisterns and 
troughs for washing were provided, but some of the washing in 
Colleges might be done in the Hall.?  Coffers and chests are 
mentioned, and chairs and forms and stools and tables. Candle- 
sticks and snuffers are mentioned also, but candles were always 
dear and scanty. Bellows and tongs showed that fires in private 
rooms were not unknown. One list of belongings includes an 
old harp and a broken lute. Another speaks of a Hornpipe. 
1 The practice of ‘‘ tucking,’ skinning the chin with the thumb-nail, 
lingered at Exeter in the seventeenth century, and the custom of compelling 
freshmen to recite under penalty of tucking was long kept up at Merton 
(Wood, Life, I, 133-4). In some French Universities these practices ran 
to ‘‘nefarious and incredible enormities.”” And in Germany the cere- 
monies associated with the ‘“ Bejaunus’’ were made the pretext for 
bullying and extortion (Rashdall, II, 628 sqg., and A Medieval Garner, 
670-3).

Others refer to swords and knives, to iron-shod staves and bows 
and arrows, in readiness, no doubt, for any fray. A Master at 
Merton in 1512 has one glass window and one which is half 
glass. And one or two wills strike a note almost of luxury with 
their bequests of silver spoons and silver-mounted goods.! 
Clothes play from the beginning a large part in the tale of 
Oxford men’s effects. Togas, tunics, tabards, hoods figure 
beside doublets, tippets and mantles. Bright colours are popular : 
there is at first no insistence upon black.* Parti-coloured 
garments were looked upon as secular. The clerk’s dress was 
generally uniform in colour and marked by some peculiarities 
of length and make. Colleges had their own liveries. It was 
only reasonable, one of the older Statutes of the University 
argued, that those whom God had adorned beyond the laity 
within, should outwardly differ from the laity in fashion.? A 
decent clerical dress and the tonsure were expected. But; 
subject to that, Oxford men in early days probably dressed much 
as they liked. Absalom in the Miller’s Tale, with his golden 
hair, his scarlet hose, his surplice white as the blossom on the 
hawthorn, and with Paul’s windows stamped on his shoes, may 
serve as a type of the humbly-born dandy in the world of medieval 
clerks. The toga, which became the modern gown, seems to 
have been a robe or tunic, longer than the tabard, worn by almost 
anyone, and as cheerful in colour as its owner wished. Under 
this gown a closer tunic might be worn, and over it the academic 
cappa. The tabard was a loose upper garment, worn out of 
doors by the poorer classes generally, and widely adopted for

2 Among the goods of Master Jacob Hedyan we find a “ togam blodii

prevailed.

E. C. Clark has three papers on the subject in the Archeological Journal 
for 1893 (73 sq., 137 sq., and 183 sq.). But the subject is full of difficulty, 
and the meaning of the terms used varies a good deal at different times 
and places, in College Statutes and elsewhere. Even Mr, Brightman’s 
clear summary in the Preface to Mr. Gunther’s Brasses in Magdalen 
College may on some points be questioned by other authorities; for 
instance, he allows the tabard short sleeves, And Prof. Clark has state- 
ments which I find it difficult to follow. I have confined myself to general 
statements in the text. But many points of detail, the use, for instance, 
of tippets, and the reason why in England only tippets have vanished 
while hoods (caputia) remain, the varieties of liripipia—evidently tails or 
ends or streamers—and the exact meaning of terms like epitogia, may be 
worth exploring further. See also the All Souls Statutes (cap. 17), and

  146 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
informal academic purposes, affected sometimes by Bachelors 
but not confined to them. Edward I gave the young De la Fytes 
tabards from his wardrobe every year. Hoods at first were 
worn by all clerks—their fur or wool was worth having in winter. 
Silk hoods came in later for the Masters’ summer wear. Bachelors 
generally and Doctors of Divinity wore hoods of lamb’s wool or 
of rabbit’s fur. Minever hoods were for Masters and persons of 
importance1; the Oxford Proctors wear them still. And a 
little triangular bunch of stuff at the back of those officers’ 
shoulders still recalls the purse in which the medieval Proctors 
carried the common funds. 
Oxford Masters wore, as the badge of their degree, the square 
cap or biretta, with a tuft instead of a tassel on the top.2 But 
certain Oxford Faculties preferred the pilewm, a round cap which, 
according to high authority, was bestowed by God Himself on the ~ 
Doctors of the Mosaic Law. The Master’s distinctive academic 
garment came to be the cappa, a sleeveless cloak or cope bordered 
or lined with fur, which was worn over the toga or the tabard. 
Originally it was the full-dress outer garment of a clerk, but it 
took many academic forms. In John of Salisbury’s day the 
metaphysical question whether a man who bought a tota cappa 
bought the hood also, was eagerly debated in the Schools. As time 
went on scarlet and purple, in the case at any rate of the superior 
Faculties, replaced more sober hues. There are indications that 
a cappa with sleeves, manicata, was regarded as the Bachelor’s 
special dress. One famous Oxford student, afterwards a Bishop 
and a Saint, is said to have been so poor that he shared a cappa 
with two friends, and the three used it in turn for attending 
lectures. There is a picture of the Chancellor wearing a scarlet 
cappa in a fourteenth-century miniature in the Oxford Chancellor’s 
Book. And at Cambridge the Vice-Chancellor wears it on 
degree days still. The pallium, like the chimera, was a variation 
of the cappa, on which an old song ingeniously refines : 
“Vidi quosdam divites 
Fame satis clare 
Formas in multiplices 
Vestes variare, 
Contra frigus hiemis 
Pallium cappare 
Veris ad introitum 
Cappam palliare.’’*   
1Mr, Anstey quotes without date a Statute forbidding Masters in 
Theology to wear minever any longer “in suis capis clausis seu palliis” 
(Mun, Acad. 393). 
? The square cap without the tuft was worn towards the end of the seven- 
teenth century by B.A’s. and foundation Scholars (Rashdall, II, 641, n.) 
3 Carmina Burana (ed. Schmeller, 75). Mr. Brightman suggests that a 
cappa clausa had a slit in front for the arms, a pallium two side slits.  
-P-A-G-E-178
  THE MEDIAIVAL UNIVERSITY AT WORK = 147 
Plain robes and tabards cost threepence, and a plain cappa 
fourpence—so the University tailors testified on oath. For a 
furred cappa or a furred robe with a palliwm sixpence was the 
proper price.1 But the rules of dress were not always carefully 
observed. A plaintive Statute of the fifteenth century rebukes 
the insolent audacity of many scholars who “ do not scruple to 
wear their hoods in the fashion of Masters,” and regulates the 
fashion closely for the future.* Later on, as the toga gained 
ground, the cappa of the Masters disappeared. But there is an 
infinite variety in the fashions followed by different orders of 
students in different Universities at different times, and the cut 
and colour of clothes in modern Oxford help us comparatively 
little to re-shape the garments of the past. 
Students living in Colleges and Halls generally took their 
meals together, and had to talk Latin while they ate them, if 
they talked at all. In the common dining-room in cold weather 
there was, no doubt, the best chance of finding a fire. Oxford 
fare had a bad name in the early sixteenth century—Sir Thomas 
More contrasted it unfavourably with the diet of Lincoln’s Inn. 
Cambridge fare had at times a still poorer reputation : one Head 
of a Cambridge College bewailed in a sermon the meagre ‘“‘ porage ”’ 
on which his students fed. And, unless Erasmus exaggerated 
grossly; some Paris students fared worst of all. But most 
Oxford clerks in the Middle Ages probably had at least two good 
meals a day, and as much meat and beer at those meals as they 
needed. In the days of Wycliffe meat and bread, butter and 
beer, were cheap enough. A farthing bought a pound of meat. 
A halfpenny bought a pound of cheese or butter. A penny 
bought six pounds of wheat. Dinner was generally at ten in 
the morning, with three or four hours of lectures or study before 
it. Supper was about five in the afternoon. Commons were 
the ordinary meals taken together at these hours, but extra food 
could be procured and eaten elsewhere. The old Hall Statutes 
tried to put down this practice,> but something beyond the two

chief meals was clearly not unknown. Breakfast of a simple 
nature for “‘ young and hungry stomachs ’’—a morning draught 
perhaps with a crust or a scrap to sweeten it—crept into fashion, 
as years went on. Later still, ‘‘nuncheon,” the ancestor of 
luncheon, which appeared at Cambridge, probably appeared at 
Oxford too. And there was drinking again—there may have 
been some food with it—before the clerks of Oxford rested from 
their toil or idleness at night. 
Work before dinner and work again till supper was in theory 
at any rate the daily round. The medieval student seems 
rarely to have grasped the modern doctrine that in a place of 
education the most important study should be play. There was 
an interval probably for exercise and disputation after dinner. 
But custom left little time beyond the evenings for amusement ; 
and the sixteenth-century Cambridge Head, who saw life in 
such gloomy colours, declared that the time after supper was 
largely spent in problems and in running up and down to get 
warm. In medieval Oxford men apparently found it easier 
to get warm after supper in roaming the streets until the curfew 
tolled, and the problems which they sought there, in spite of the 
rules made to regulate their roaming, were often of a noisy and 
a lusty kind. The worst rascals are frankly accused of sleeping 
by day and doing evil by night.t Sport was certainly not 
unknown. Hawking and cock-fighting were common enough. 
Dogs and ferrets and ‘‘ unclean beasts’? were as popular with 
country boys in the fourteenth century as in the twentieth. But 
it was not thought fitting that serious students should play 
among the birds of the air, or that poor men living largely on 
alms should give the bread of the sons of men for dogs to eat.? 
Poaching in the woods and streams round Oxford was perhaps 
more popular still, The roads near the University were some- 
times infested by outcast scholars on the look-out for prey, 
who added the joys of the highwayman to the delights of sport. 
Innocent gamies were probably less common. The chief amuse- 
ment of the age was fighting, and clerks were not supposed to be 
fighting men. Exercises to develop the body were no part of 
the medieval system of developing the mind. Gambling may 
have needed sharp discouragement. Rowdyism and practical 
joking required it even more. Musical instruments, no doubt, 
called for regulation: there is a touch of humour in the Statutes 
of some German Universities which permitted them, ‘‘ provided

and games allowed in the Universities of Europe.

they were musical’’ at seasonable hours. And William of 
Wykeham may have had good reason for forbidding dancing 
in Hall or Chapel as well as leaping and singing and inordinate 
noise. The Devil, in the medieval churchman’s view, was 
“the inventor and governor and disposer of dances.” Yet 
Chaucer’s parish-clerk could trip and dance in twenty ways 
“ After the schole of Oxenforde tho, 
And with his leggis castin to and fro.” 
It is less easy to understand the insolence and profanity which 
the medizval educationist discovered in games of ball, or the 
spirit which denounced chess as “ noxious and unhonest,” in 
days when the great bell of St. Mary’s summoned undergraduates 
to battle, and the narrow lanes round Carfax sometimes ran 
with blood. 
Hand in hand with tumult and disorder, with stern and 
vain attempts at discipline, and with an ardour in pursuit of 
knowledge capable of noble and austere ideals, went many forms 
of piety befitting clerks. Religion and its ceremonies entered 
closely into life. Daily Mass was not at first compulsory, but 
it gradually became the rule.? Singing the Antiphon of the 
Virgin was associated with the evening drinking, as prayers 
among children are associated with bedtime. Feasting and 
praying often went together. The Feasts of the Nations, at 
Paris at any rate, began with a Mass if they ended with a carouse. 
Saints’ Days made constant holidays. St. Scholastica’s Day 
was a great festival—made memorable in the middle of the 
fourteenth century by one of the worst Oxford riots ever known. 
So were the Feast of St. Nicholas and the vigils of St. Peter 
and St. John. Processions and sermons interrupted lectures 
and broke the monotony of term. In winter on the nights of 
Saints’ Days songs might be sung and stories told and poems 
or chronicles recited round the braziers in the College Halls. 
On Twelfth Night even mummers found admission. The 
prejudice against strolling players had hardly yet begun. 
Of early miracle-plays acted in the Colleges we hear little 
in Oxford history. It is not till the close of the Middle Ages 
that we find scriptural plays given at Magdalen, and payments 
in the College accounts to the Master of the choristers for the 
tunic of the actor who played the part of Christ, for hair for the 
women,? for refreshments for the boys. It is not till the same

period that we find the election of a Rex Fabarum mentioned 
in the Register of Merton College. But the ancient ceremonies 
of the Boy Bishop were sanctioned, it seems, even by dignitaries 
of the Church, and the spectacle of children ‘‘ strangelye decked 
and appareled to counterfaite priestes, bysshops and women,” 
and of boys who “‘ singe masse and preache in the pulpitt, with 
suche other unfittinge and inconvenyent usages,” ? lingered till 
the Reformation swept it away. We have traces of the Boy 
Bishop at All Souls and Magdalen, and even earlier at New 
College. We find Christmas Kings later at Christ Church and 
New College, at Magdalen and St. John’s. Before the Reforma- 
tion is over we have an English play, Thersytes, acted surely 
at Oxford, with allusions to the Proctors and their men at 
Broken Hays. We have a Latin sacred play produced at 
Brasenose, and the Christ Church authorities limiting their 
expenditure on drama to four plays a year, ‘‘a Comedy in 
Lattin and a Comedy in Greek and a Tragedie in Lattin and 
a Tragedy in Greek.” * The era of classical or semi-classical 
plays at the University has begun. 
Christmas of course was the chief time for these festivities. 
The King of Misrule had power in his brief days of sovereignty 
to impose punishments upon the juniors and to set the servants 
in the stocks. Christmas carols mingled freely with the medieval 
love-songs, the tales of Constantine, of Nebuchadnezzar, of 
Pyramus and Thesbes and the rest. John Hyde’s book, a 
delightful miscellany in the Library of Balliol College, contains 
among its saws and ballads, its hints for dosing horses, helping 
curates, making beer and soap and ink, a collection of songs 
and stories which must often have been heard round Oxford 
fires. Lovers’ lamentations— 
“O my hart is woo, Mary she sayd so ’’—

so fully kept. See on the whole subject Boas (University Drama, Chap I,

are followed by Christmas anthems of rejoicing :

The words of ‘‘ The Nutbrown Mayde”’ are preserved beside a

Oxford boys may well have been thinking of their mothers if 
they stayed up over Christmastide. Their ideas of amusement 
were perhaps more limited, their vacations at first less lengthy 
and elaborate, than ours. But holidays on ecclesiastical pretexts 
were popular and frequent, especially popular, it seems, with 
teachers. Non-legible days, when the Masters did not lecture, 
were always increasing in number. The Calendar shows in one 
month alone, November, eleven days besides Sundays which 
counted as holidays so far as the University teachers were 
concerned. And, though vacations at Christmas and Easter 
were comparatively brief, it seems clear that the Long Vacation 
established at an early date as good a claim to the title as it 
enjoys to-day. 
How far in medieval Oxford religion entered into character 
it would be a harder task to say. Into the ordinary curriculum 
of the Arts student it entered very little. Canonists and 
theologians followed studies of their own. Even for- priests 
the University supplied comparatively little religious education. 
For the ordinary man it supplied still less. Every scholar at 
Oxford was regarded as a clerk and claimed the privileges of 
that far-extended Order, privileges which sometimes made 
benefit of clergy merely a synonym for evading the penalties 
1A date about July 5 or 6 was recognised as the date for the Cessatio 
and October 10 as the date for the Reswmpcio magistrorum vegencium. 
“Statutum est quod citra proximum diem legibilem ante festum S. 
Thomae cessare non liceat ullo modo.”’ (See Mun. Acad. 447, where the 
last paragraph, in the earliest hand of Register A, must be before 1350. 
Mun. Acad. cxlv is a little misleading. But see also Wordsworth, Ancient 
Kalendar of Univ. of Oxford, 92-3 and 98-9). Oxford also took some 
days’ holiday at Whitsuntide. The Pope’s attempt in 1261 to limit 
the summer vacation at Paris to one month broke down in practice at 
an early date (Rashdall, I, 477). There seems no need for Mr. Macray’s 
suggestion (Register of Magdalen College, II, iii-iv) that the Long Vacation 
grew out of fifteenth-century migrations to avoid the Plague, although the 
unhealthiness of Oxford, due to that and other causes, may in early days 
have helped to establish the custom. A good many members of the 
University probably remained in Oxford for at least partof the time.

of the law. But in the case of students the tonsure was generally 
conferred by the barber and not by the Bishop. Some clerks 
took Holy Orders, some took Minor Orders, some took no Orders 
at all. The Church was not made for priests alone. It was the 
avenue to all peaceable professions, the way of advancement 
for the poor and humble, the natural inheritance of educated 
men. Ministers of State and men of business, civil servants, 
lawyers and physicians, secretaries, diplomatists, architects, 
accountants, were all drawn from the great community of clerks. 
Neither the University nor the Colleges laid stress at first on 
Holy Orders as a condition of office. It was chiefly the wish 
to endow theologians or to provide for the service of the Church 
which led to Fellowships being reserved for the clergy. Celibacy 
was a part of a clerk’s obligations, just as much as the tonsure 
or the clerical dress. Clerks who married forfeited their claim 
to a degree. Masters who married lost their right to teach and 
their right to share in College Fellowships and other clerical 
endowments. But there were, no doubt, exceptions and incon- 
sistencies in the enforcement of the rule. Clerical responsibilities 
could be lightly worn. And it seems clear that in medieval 
Oxford married scholars were not unknown.? 
Clerical obligations certainly did not extinguish the secular 
spirit in Oxford life. Ecclesiastical moralists have drawn black 
pictures of student vice in the Middle Ages, and the student 
quarters of thirteenth-century Paris may have revealed ugly 
scenes of license.? Each of the Nations there was credited with 
its own peculiar failings. But the hard-drinking English were 
compared not unfavourably with the empty, boastful Normans, 
the brutish fools from Burgundy, and the raging Germans, 
obscene in their cups. At Oxford the Proctors had to keep a 
list of homicides and grave offenders banished from the city. 
Inquisitions into the morals of students were made yearly by 
the Chancellor’s authority, to put down the scandals of ‘‘ bucklery ” 
and taverning and the grosser forms of vice. The insistence on 
ineffectual spiritual punishments, and the reliance on oaths to 
enforce regulations—at one German University students even 
had to swear not to knife the examiners who “ ploughed” 
1 But with men admitted to Ordination some more formal ceremony 
was, no doubt, required. (See Rashdall, II, 644, sq.) 
2 E.g. in 1234 the King ordered the release of certain scholars’ con- 
cubines from prison (Cal. C.R., 1231-4, 570), and in 1459 an indenture 
between Town and University speaks of a clerk or scholar ‘‘ havyng a 
wyf” (Mun. Acad. 347). 
% According to Jacques de Vitry’s well-known indictment, “ honorificum 
reputabant si quis publice teneret unam vel pluras concubinas,” for worse 
vices prevailed. “In una autem et eadem domo schole erant superius, 
prostibula inferius ’’ (Jacobi de Vitriaco, Libri Duo, Hist. Occident. 278).

them—made life and evil-doing easy for the rascal whom no 
scruples in regard to perjury restrained. It was only by slow 
degrees that fines and guarantees of a practical nature took the 
place of vows which had no sanction beyond the terrors of the 
Church. It is interesting to find in the fifteenth century two 
Principals of Halls after a sharp quarrel swearing on the Holy 
Gospels vows of peace and affection for the future, and one 
offender who had struck the other humbly asking pardon on 
his knees. But it was probably of more practical importance 
that both delinquents were asked to give substantial security, 
for the workings of the clerical conscience often failed to justify 
the leniency shown to guilty clerks.+ 
The commonest source of trouble was drink. Half the 
householders of Oxford brewed and sold beer.?. Drinking was 
part of every academic triumph. It accompanied each step in a 
University man’s career. It was the universal form of hospitality, 
jollity, amusement, the chief occupation, failing others, of a 
roystering age. It was a natural corollary of this system that 
the Chancellor had to see to it that the Oxford taverners kept 
up the quality of their beer. But that did not prevent their 
making it with water from streams into which the sewers emptied, 
or stop complaints that liquor in Oxford was unfit to drink 
and inordinately dear. It was ano less natural result of these 
habits that there was constant brawling in the streets, practical 
jokes more humorous to perpetrators than to victims, baiting of 
watchmen and worrying of citizens, mischievous frolic and clamour 
and song. Student songs which have come down to us deal so 
largely with the tale of follies, that they give perhaps an over- 
coloured picture of frivolity which was often innocent enough. 
It would be churlish to grudge to the clerks of the Middle Ages 
the light-heartedness which, mingled with serious endeavour, 
makes modern Oxford the most entrancing city in the world. 
But the note which the old songs strike is not seldom one of 
careless contempt for the sanctities of life. 
A rich collection of these songs has descended to us, dating 
from the thirteenth century and from even earlier days.? Many 
1 Mun. Acad. (552-4). But candid churchmen in the thirteenth 
century complained that even fines were ineffectual, and admitted that 
clerical offenders were often punished in money, if at all, for crimes for 
which they “ should justly be committed to a life-long prison ” (A Medieval 
Garner, 586).

century, it might be different later when professional breweries increased.

of them, it is true, are serious in tone, devotional and moral. 
They deal with grave or sacred themes. The vanity of life, the 
instability of fortune, the rewards of faith, are ever on the singers’ 
lips. 
““Memor esto juvenis, 
Tui Creatoris, 
Crux Christi te moneat 
Omnibus in horis.”’ 
There are laments of poverty and hymns of praise, songs of the 
Crusaders and songs of the classics, and songs recalling the 
nativity of Christ. Saladin and Helen, Pilate and Herod, 
Dido and Venus, are strangely mingled with Prophets, Patriarchs 
and Fathers. The sins of priests come in for chastisement. 
Rome and her greatness, her failings, her exactions, fill no small 
space in the singers’ minds. 
“Roma caput mundi est 
Sed nihil capit mundum.” 
But the larger number of them, and probably the most popular, 
are songs not of devotion but of idleness, of love and gaiety 
anddrink. They are full of the call of the spring and the sunshine, 
of the woods and fields, of the birds and flowers. They are alive 
with the delight of being young. The claims of youth to joy 
are urged incessantly, in contrast with the futility and uselessness 
of age. 
“‘ Congaudentes ludite, 
Choros simul ducite ! 
Juvenes sunt lepidi, 
Senes sunt decrepiti.” 
The world of churchmen vanishes, and a world of lovers, a 
frankly pagan spirit, takes its place. 
“ Quicquid agant alii, 
Juvenes amemus.” 
Here and there we get a reminder that the singers are scholars 
too. But their studies are only things to be forgotten, their 
ars dialectica a source of woe. Venus and Bacchus are the Gods 
whom they worship. They have no misgivings of modesty or 
shame. A parody of the Mass expresses the blasphemous prayer 
that the Power which has set discord between clerks and rustics 
will grant the clerks to live by the rustics’ labours and to rejoice 
in their wives. They haunt the tavern rather than the church, 
for drinking naturally ministers to love. 
“Bacchus forte superans 
Pectora virorum 
In amorem concitet 
Animos eorum.
-P-A-G-E-186
  THE MEDIZVAL UNIVERSITY AT WORK = 155 
Bacchus sepe visitans 
Mulierum genus 
Facit eas subditas 
Tibi, O tu Venus!” 
The confession of Golias, the typical representative of the low- 
living, wine-bibbing clerk, has been translated by a brilliant 
writer.1 But among pictures of drinking, dicing and debauchery 
fairer scenes are set. There are maidens wandering in wild 
lawns and woody places, blackbirds singing in thickets, blossoming 
orchards, ripening corn-fields, shepherdesses plucking fruit and 
flowers. Young girls debate the claims of their lovers, whether 
the clerk or the soldier be the properer man. A son, sick unto 
death, entreats his father’s leave to take the cowl, and the father 
bids him remember the coarse fare, the cold water, the dreary 
round of the monastic life. A poet protests that his lyre, his 
art, is dearer to him than wine or kisses or even life itself. The 
perils of water are a favourite topic : the peril was real in medieval 
towns. The gains and griefs of gaming are another. But youth 
and its inheritance of strength and of enjoyment is the surpassing 
theme. 
“ Gaudeamus igitur, 
Juvenes dum sumus.” 
Life is brief, death certain. Honour the University which 
breeds us, the Founders who support us, the commonwealth 
which guards us, the women whom we love. 
“ Perish sorrow, perish care ! 
Perish envious blamers ! 
Devils who the soul ensnare, 
Dullards, kill-joys everywhere, 
Scoffers and defamers.” 
The world of the song-writers is a world of cheerful license, 
hardly held in awe by the authority of the Church. Discipline, 
no doubt, improved as the organisation of the Halls and Colleges 
grew stronger, and as University legislation became more 
judicious and complete. But in the records of medieval Oxford 
there is abundant evidence of the rough violence of life. If 
they do not show such picturesque vicissitudes as Paris—a 
Provost forced to kiss the corpse of a scholar he has hanged, or 
a great Abbot organising a murderous affray—they show instance 
after instance of assault and murder, often punished, an Oxford 
historian reminds us, by nothing worse than migration to Cam- 
bridge. Bishops exhorted the clerks of their dioceses to attend 
the Schools prepared for study and not armed for a fight. Oaths

not to carry arms and not to conspire to make disturbances were 
administered only to be broken. The students even rose in 
rebellion against Statutes passed by the Masters for the preserva- 
tion of the peace, and carried into office a Chancellor and Proctors 
whom they expected to support their views.! There were fights 
with the King’s foresters, fights with the officers of justice, 
fights with the monks of Abingdon, fights between clerks and 
laymen, fights among the clerks themselves. And the offenders 
were not only rowdy boys, but Masters, Friars, beneficed clergy- 
men, Heads of Halls, principalities and powers. Old Statutes 
are at pains to point out that the ancient and cunning Enemy 
of mankind is always stirring up strife among students. He 
seems to have had an unhappy influence over Vicars of St. 
Giles’, and once tempted the Warden of Canterbury College to 
sanction a street-raid by his scholars on other people’s beer.? 
Jousts and tournaments in the neighbourhood of Oxford 
offered agreeable opportunities for disorder. They were pro- 
hibited by Edward I and Edward II. ‘Much lewd people,” 
says Fuller, “waited on these assemblies, light housewives as 
well as light horsemen.’’ Swords and trumpets, rattling of arms 
and “roaring of riotous revellers all the night” disturbed the 
peaceful scholars at their studies. ‘‘ Where Mars keeps his term, 
there the Muses may even make their vacation.” 3? Parliament 
was called in to enforce morality at Oxford. Students were 
forbidden to spend their nights in taverns. In the troubles of 
Edward II’s day Oxford played only an unwilling part. A 
handsome, young impostor declared himself the son of Edward I, 
and established himself in the Palace at Beaumont with a dog 
and a cat to maintain his claim. The headless corpse of Piers 
Gaveston was brought to the Black Friars’ Convent in the marshes. 
Isabella took possession of the town, when her unhappy husband 
fled before her. Orleton, the turbulent Bishop of Hereford, laid 
before the University the cause of the Queen,* and the younger 
Edward, a boy of thirteen, was present at that memorable sermon 
1Sir H. C. M. Lyte (131-2) gives the date as 1327, but it is a little 
uncertain. Twyne (MS. XXII, 366) suggests 1347, but quotes an old 
Lichfield chronicle as giving the date 1330. It must surely be this 
chronicler whom Wood refers to (Ann. I, 442), without acknowledgment 
to Twyne, as an author “‘ whose name to me is yet unknown.”’ But it 
seems that 1347 cannot be aright date: 1338 or 1349 might be. 1349 was 
apparently the year of John Wylliott’s stormy election as Chancellor. See

in 1326. It wasatime of weak administration. The old enmities 
between the Nations blazed out afresh. In 1334 a violent battle 
between North and South filled the Castle jail to overflowing 
with arrested clerks. Fierce quarrels broke out between the 
scholars and their servants. The authorities proved powerless. 
The King interfered. Many of the clerks, Northerners especially, 
abandoned Oxford and transferred their studies to Stamford, 
where already, it seems, before the end of 1333, a contingent of 
Oxford students had arrived. That memorable secession, which 
Merlin had foretold in academic Latin, is a landmark in the 
troubles of the age.t It was the most determined attempt ever 
made by dissatisfied Oxford students to set up a new University 
elsewhere. It failed, as the earlier migrations to Salisbury and 
Northampton had failed before it. But it clearly alarmed the 
authorities, and it left its traces stamped on Oxford customs for 
five hundred years. For several months the seceding scholars 
persisted in their enterprise, in spite of Royal warnings and urgent 
exhortations to return. As late as July 1335 there were thirty- 
eight Oxford men, mostly Northerners, at Stamford, with Masters 
and students and a “‘ manciple atte Brasenose’”’ among them, 
who had carried into exile the names and customs of their old 
home. For many generations there survived in Stamford the 
Brasenose Hall which these students had established, and the 
famous knocker, brought apparently from Oxford, which after 
an absence of five and a half centuries has found its way back 
to Brasenose College. And down to the year 1827 an oath not 
to give or attend lectures at Stamford as a University or place 
of general study was part of the statutory ritual at Oxford for 
all candidates taking a degree.® 
1A Petition of 1334, apparently from the Stamford seceders, dwells 
on the innumerable robberies and ills which Town and University authori- 
ties were equally powerless to control (Collectanea, III, 133). See also 
Salter (Med. Arch. I, 126-7), and Lyte (134-5). 
2 This Hall, older possibly than the migration which gave it its name, 
survived apparently till 1688, and its gateway was set up again after its 
demolition. In 1890 Brasenose College bought the property and brought 
the Brazen Nose back to Oxford. (See Monograph II, by Mr. F. Madan, 
in the Brasenose Quatercentenary volumes.) 
8“Tu jurabis quod non leges nec audies Stamfordie tanquam in 
Universitate studio aut collegio generali” (Mun. Acad. 375). On the 
secession to Stamford, which may have begun in 1333, see Brasenose 
Quatercentenary Monographs (I, 15-20), Victoria County Hist. of Lincoln- 
shire (II, 468-74), and Collectanea (I, 3 sq.) with Dr. Rashdall’s criticism 
(II, 397, n.). It is an interesting and difficult question when the Stam- 
ford Schools began, how far they developed and how long they lasted. 
There were certainly old Schools in the town, and Masters may have 
lectured there after 1335. But the so-called University had a brief life.

158 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
But more formidable even than the quarrels of the Nations 
were the great conflicts between Town and Gown. As the 
thirteenth century drew to a close, the powers of the University 
steadily increased. Sharp disputes arose with the townsmen. 
There were complaints against Robert Welles, the King’s Bailiff 
in Beaumont. He stubbornly denied the University’s rights 
in the fields about St. Giles’, where the students roamed and 
played. There were complaints on the other side against the 
Chancellor, who had perhaps exceeded his prerogative and abused 
his powers. King and Parliament intervened to stop them. 
Edward I proved on the whole a good friend to the scholars. 
In 1288 the University secured a triumph in the removal of 
Robert Welles from office, and the Masters vowed to suspend 
all lectures if he were restored. But the quarrels went on, and 
in 1298 a famous fray occurred. 
On Friday the 21st February a fight began at Carfax between 
certain scholars and one of the Bailiffs of the town. It is far 
from clear that the scholars were not the aggressors. The 
offenders were arrested and rescued by their friends. Next day, 
Saturday the 22nd, the clerks met at St. Mary’s and assaulted 
all the townsmen they could find, beating one of them before 
the high altar of the church, and adding point to their action by 
praying ostentatiously for the souls of three others who would 
soon be dead. The Bailiffs, applying for justice to the Chancellor, 
were curtly told to punish their own men. They set a watch, 
but the clerks attacked them. Thereupon the Bailiffs seized 
and imprisoned three clerks, and Sunday was spent by the one 
side, it seems, in invading the students’ quarters, and by the 
clerks assembled about St. Mary’s in killing one man and assault- 
ing others. The Proctors seem to have made a belated attempt 
to prevent things going further. But blood was up on both 
sides, and on the Monday the opposing forces were on foot. The 
bell of St. Martin’s summoned the townsmen. Ox-horns sounded 
in the streets. The battle raged from Carfax to St. Mary’s. 
Houses were broken into, shops were sacked. Messengers, it is 
said, were hurried off to bring up reinforcements. But after 
the fall of Fulk Neyrmit, a fighting parson, shot by an arrow 
from an upper chamber by a townsman defending his house, 
do not think the passage quoted by Twyne (XXII, 366) and referred to 
by Dean Rashdall (II, 397-8 and 756) is concerned with the secession to 
Stamford. But Dr. Rashdall has not missed the interesting colophon in 
William Wheteley’s Commentary on Boethius’ De disciplina scholarium 
(MS. Exeter College, 28), which shows that a Master was lecturing at 
Stamford in 1309. Does that imply a grammar school only or something 
more ?

University see later (pp. 162-3).

the clerks seem for the moment to have accepted defeat. At 
least they obeyed the Proctors’ orders to withdraw to their 
lodgings. Some of them may have been carried off to prison : 
the Chancellor would not have been backward to demand their 
release. Nor was he backward in blaming the town authorities 
for the outbreak and in demanding the keys of the gates. The 
Bishop was informed that the townsmen had made an attack 
on the innocent scholars. The burgesses complained to the 
King that the criminals of two counties made their home in 
Oxford and wore the habit of the Oxford clerks. But when 
justice got to work on the offenders, the Church as usual proved 
too powerful for its opponents. The town was fined. The 
liberties of the University were confirmed: it was the Bailiffs’ 
entering scholars’ houses to arrest them, which had caused the 
deepest resentment. Certain laymen arrested by the Chancellor 
and released by the Bailiffs were sent back to prison. The 
leaders of the townsmen were banished or removed from their 
places. For others, with the mild inefficiency of medieval 
justice, a general annesty was allowed.1 But the townsmen 
nursed their injuries still. In the years which followed they 
took the opportunity to remodel the walls of St. Martin’s Church, 
so as to increase its convenience as a citadel for defence or for 
attack.? 
Riots on this scale were rare, but fights as mischievous and 
bitter continued to keep up the unending feud. Something 
more than high spirits or low tastes is needed to account for 
them. A deeper cause lay in the wide-spread grievance felt 
against the ever-encroaching privileges of clerks.* Fifty years 
later a still more famous outbreak in Oxford echoed perhaps a 
stronger note of national discontent. The Black Death had 
1 The most recent and exact account of this riot is given by Mr. Salter 
(Med. Arch. I, 43 sq.), who prints the deeds bearing on the subject and 
giving both points of view. Different accounts vary in their details. 
The most important original accounts are given by Walsingham (Hist. 
Anglicana, I, 62-3), in the Opus Chronicorum (59), by Rishanger (Chronica, 
167)—all in the Rolls Series, edited by Riley, and all giving the date as 
1296—and in Annales Monastici (ed. Luard in the same series, IV, 539). 
The Select Cases from the Coroners’ Rolls (printed by the Selden Society, 
90-91) give in picturesque detail the inquest on ‘ Fulco Neyrnuyt.” 
See also Wood (Amn. I, 349 sq.), Lyte (122-5), and compare the version 
of the concord between Town and University, dated Sept. 22, 1298, in

Acad. 67-9).

accepting a decision by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop

  160 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
changed the face of England and had created dim new possibilities 
for the poor. It had swept away, we are told, an incalculable 
number of the common people, and of monks and clerks “a 
multitude known only to God.”’! Wages leaped up. Labour 
seized. its opportunity. Archbishop Islip bewailed ‘“‘the un- 
bridled cupidity of the human race.” Even salaried priests 
demanded large increases of pay. Vested interests began to 
tremble. The spirit which stirred the Lollards, which armed 
Jack Cade, was afoot. But the famous riot of St. Scholastica’s 
Day, Tuesday the roth February 1355, differed little in its origin 
from the riots that had gone before. A party of clerks drinking 
at the Swyndlestock tavern beside Carfax quarrelled with the 
vintner and broke his head with a quart-pot. His friends took 
up his cause. St. Martin’s bell brought out the townsmen. The 
Chancellor, interposing to keep the peace, had to flee for his life. 
The scholars, summoned in their turn by the clamour from St. 
Mary’s steeple, hastened to the Chancellor’s relief, and fighting 
followed with no great damage till night fell. 
But matters were not allowed to rest there. Next morning 
the Chancellor warned the students sternly against breaches of 
the peace, while the Mayor rode off to Woodstock to lay his 
complaints before the King. But the townsmen were already 
collecting their forces and calling in allies from the country-side. 
They were determined not to miss so good.an opportunity of 
settling accounts with the spoilt children of the Church. Four- 
score citizens, secretly collected at St. Giles’, broke out upon the 
scholars in Beaumont Fields. Again the bells clanged and the 
armies mustered, and a fierce and much more dangerous fight 
ensued. The scholars tried to shut the gates, but the country- 
men poured through them—two thousand strong, it was said, 
with a black flag at their head. ~The clerks were overpowered 
and took refuge in their Halls and Inns. But the Halls and 
Inns were fired and pillaged. Books, lyres, clothes, carpets, 
and a curious belt composed of human skins * are mentioned in 
11It is not easy to find definite information as to the effects of the 
Black Death on the University, though there are various references to 
the havoc wrought among clerks, and one. Petition of the period repre- 
sents the University in general terms as ruined and enfeebled by it (Collect. 
III, 137-8). In the dioceses of Norwich and York it has been estimated 
that two-thirds of the clergy died, and half the population of England 
is said to have been swept away. But Geoffrey le Baker, an Oseney 
clerk, has only vague and meagre statements about the effects at Oxford 
(see his Chronicle, ed. E. M, Thompson, 99). See also Creighton’s History 
of Epidemics in Britain (chap. III), Miss Putnam’s Enforcement of the 
Statutes of Labourers, and her article on Wage Laws for Priests (American 
Hist, Rev., Oct. 1915).

the list.of spoils. Cries of ‘‘ Slay, Slay, Havoc, Havoc,” resounded 
through the night : 
“‘Vexilla prodito ad domus properans 
Banno sic edito ‘Ha Wok’ vociferans.”’ + 
With the morning the Chancellor in his turn hurried to the King, 
and efforts, perhaps now dictated by panic, were made to keep 
the clerks at home. But again the mob broke into the Halls. 
Scholars were beaten, wounded, killed, pursued to the churches 
and dragged from sanctuary there. Some were even carried off 
and tortured, their tonsured crowns flayed “in scorn of their 
clergy.”” The Friars marched out in solemn procession. But 
their crucifix was dashed to the ground, and a scholar murdered 
while clinging to the Friar who bore the Host. The vanquished 
clerks abandoned the contest and fled in despair. Within a few 
days Oxford was deserted by all students who could not find 
protection behind walls strong enough to defy attack. 
Then, slowly but surely, the hand of retribution fell. The 
Bishop of Lincoln laid the town under an interdict. The King 
at last set his justice on foot. A Commission was appointed to 
inquire into the riot. Two hundred townsmen were arrested 
and the Sheriff of Oxfordshire dismissed. The Mayor and his 
chief associates were sent to prison. Both Town and University 
had to surrender their privileges, but the University’s were 
restored within four days. Once again the Church and her 
supporters triumphed, and the burgesses paid dearly for excesses 
which had delivered them into their enemies’ hands. A new 
Charter in June 1355 bestowed on the University, more precious 
to the King than gold or topaz, fresh powers of interfering with 
the trade and government of the town, powers of regulating 
bread and ale and weights and measures, of supervising markets, 
of keeping the streets, of assessing the taxes of privileged persons, 
of punishing laymen as well as clerks for carrying arms. A 
heavy fine was imposed for damage done in the riot.2 Goods 
seized from the clerks were collected and returned. The Chan- 
cellor’s jurisdiction was definitely extended to the Northern 
suburb.? But it was some months before the Masters consented 
to resume their lectures. It was still longer before the Church 
1See the Poems on the Riot given in Bodi. MS. 859, and printed in 
Collectanea (III, 165 sg.). The University complains of her sufferings 
and troubles, and of the viper John de Bereford, the Mayor who had 
stirred up the strife. 
2 The University accepted fifty pounds— quinquaginta libras argenti ”’ 
—in the end. But much larger demands were made at first. (See Med. 
Arch. I, 44 and 158-9, and Mun. Civ. Oxon. 132 and 135.)

1356. (See Mun, Acad. 173-80, and Salter’s Med. Arch. I, 161-6).)

made terms. And even then the Mayor and Bailiffs and sixty 
burgesses were bound under penalty of a hundred marks to attend 
each year a Mass at St. Mary’s on St. Scholastica’s Day for the 
souls of the clerks who had been killed, and to offer a penny 
apiece in memory of their victims. Even when Masses for the 
dead went out of fashion, the University substituted other 
services and insisted that the penance should go on. It was not 
till 1825 that the petitions of the townsmen for its abolition were 
accepted and the time-honoured vengeance of the University 
appeased.? 
The Chancellor’s position was now secure. The town and 
its liberties had passed more and more under his control. His 
old spiritual jurisdiction over the scholars of Oxford, depending 
on ecclesiastical sanctions and support, had become in effect a 
territorial monarchy and extended widely over laymen. The 
Charter of 1244, a long step in the process of aggrandisement, 
had given him civil jurisdiction in debts and contracts in which 
clerks were concerned. The Charter of 1248 had asserted his 
rights against the town. The Charter of 1255 had given him 
a voice in the punishment of laymen who injured clerks, a 
considerable measure of criminal jurisdiction. The reign of 
Edward I had seen his powers and those of the University steadily 
enlarged. An important Charter of 1275 had confirmed his 
authority in civil actions in which either party was a scholar.® 
A still more important agreement, made in 1290 between Univer- 
sity and Town in the presence of the King,* had defined and 
1The settlement arrived at in May 1357 is given in Mun. Acad. 
(190-202) and in Med. Arch. (I, 168-71). See also Ogle (Royal Letters, 
51-65 and 331-3). The community was punished, according to medieval 
methods, but individual offenders came off more or less lightly. 
2 Among recent writers Dean Rashdall gives a full account of this 
memorable riot (II, 403-8), with detailed references which I need not 
repeat. But, like Sir H. C. M. Lyte and Prof. Thorold Rogers and more 
than one of the old chroniclers, he dates it Feb. 1354, instead of Feb. 
1355. The right date is given in Thompson’s edition of Adam of Muri- 
muth (421-2) and by Ogle, as above. Wood’s account (Amn. i. 456 sq.) 
is as racy as usual. Mr. Salter prints some important documents (Med. 
Arch. I, 148 sq.), beginning with the King’s writ of March 5, 1355, taking 
the University into his special protection, and others from the City 
Records (Mun. Civ. Oxon. 126 sq.). Of the references in the Close Rolls 
and Patent Rolls perhaps the most important is the King’s mandate of 
July 1355, reciting the privileges reserved to the University (Cal. Cl. R., 
1354-60, p. 140). 
Dean Rashdall comments (II, 398), ‘‘ it is not clear that the former 
privileges gave a civil jurisdiction except when the scholar was defendant.” 
In 1286 (Cal. Pat. Rolls, 236) there was a fresh grant of jurisdiction to 
the Chancellor in actions and contracts between scholars and Jews. (See 
also Med. Arch. I, 40.) 
4 “Coram ipso Domino Rege et ejus consilio ad Parliamentum ” (Mun. 
Acad. 46). The Crown interfered freely when it thought fit.  
-P-A-G-E-194
  
THE MEDIZVAL UNIVERSITY AT WORK 163 
strengthened his jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases in which 
one of the parties was a clerk.1 It had asserted his rights over 
the King’s Bailifis. It had extended them over wide classes of 
University servants and dependents. It had revealed the 
grievances resented by the townsfolk and the high claims of 
University officials. It may well have deepened the old jealousies 
which led to the riot of 1298.2. But the settlement which followed 
the Slaughter of 1355 was even more conclusive. It decided in 
the University’s favour the long contentions of the past, and 
gave the Chancellor an irresistible authority over the traders 
and the independence of the town. 
It was no question now of defending the liberties of scholars 
against the jealousies of townsmen. The only question was how 
far the burgesses of Oxford were to retain the freedom and self- 
government which they had long enjoyed. They were still a 
powerful community. They probably out-numbered the clerks.? 
They had flourishing trades. Twenty-nine brewers, eighteen 
butchers, sixteen bakers, twelve tapsters, all women, are men- 
tioned in the records of 1380-81. Skinners, weavers, carpenters 
and fullers were equally well represented, while forty-nine tailors, 
fifteen bootmakers and seven glovers ministered to the appearance 
of clerk and layman alike. The town income quietly increased. 
By the end of the fourteenth century rents produced over seven- 
teen pounds a year. The cellars under the Guildhall yielded 
something. Closed roads, the strip of land under the wall, the 
turrells which defended it, yielded something too. Fees for 
admissions to the Guild varied, but might bring in as much or 
more.* There were small profits from the Castle Mill, from 
fishing in the town moat, from the stalls kept by butchers. The 
fee-farm collected for the Crown by the Bailiffs may sometimes 
have yielded a substantial surplus,® but this, it is probable, the 
1“ Except in cases of homicide and mayhem,” (See Rashdall, II, 
401, n., and App. xxxii.) Compare with the agreement given by Mr. 
Anstey (46-56), the Inspeximus of 1315 printed by Mr. Salter (Med. 
Arch, I, 88-94). 
2 It may be added that in 1309 the scholars were granted the right 
to summon laymen before the Chancellor in personal actions. This was 
confirmed in 1324 and 1327. (See Cal. Pat. Rolls, 1309, p. 103; 1324, 
P. 391; 1327, p. 22; and Med. Arch. I, 83-4.) 
3 Prof. Rogers (Oxf. City Docts., ed. Boase, v) estimated from the Poll- 
tax rolls of 1380 that there were 2,035 laymen over fifteen in the town. 
« But often less (Mun. Civ. Oxon. xxxiii). Mr. Salter prints some of 
the Chamberlains’ accounts (Ib. 253 sq.). No accounts of the Bailiffs 
survive, 
5 Ib. (xxxvi-ix). In 1352 the fee-farm was reduced from £63 os. 5d. 
to £58 os. 5d. In 1537 it was reduced again. In case of subsidies voted 
by Parliament Oxford was rated at a fixed amount for each “tenth,” 
namely {91 7s. tod. This was reduced by £10 or more in 1440 (Jb. 207).

  164 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Bailiffs kept. The town had no reason to fear for its prosperity. 
But it was falling under its rival’s sway. The Chancellor’s 
authority had to a large extent superseded that of the town 
officials. His Court was popular and active: in actions for debt 
its procedure was rapid and cheap.!_ He was mainly responsible 
for peace and order. He had charge of the streets. He settled 
what taxes the University’s dependents paid. He interfered 
freely with the traders of Oxford, with their markets and their 
prices, and with the quality and distribution of their goods.? 
The supply of food and drink was naturally a matter of the 
first importance, and the University’s efforts to keep down their 
cost were a never-ending source of contention with the town. 
In 1285 we find the Chancellor complaining that the Mayor and 
Bailiffs exacted a quarter of every salmon sold. In 1293 the 
King commanded that the price of wine for Oxford scholars 
should be only a halfpenny more than the London rate. In 
1311 the King required the Mayor and Bailiffs to confiscate at 
the /Chancellor’s demand all wine found to be “ putrid and 
corrupt.” 5 As the fourteenth century proceeded, Royal Man- 
dates poured into Oxford ® to regulate the trade and conduct of 
the town, writs in regard to the assize of bread and ale, writs for 
paving and cleansing the streets, for avoiding smells, for purifying 
water, for working fat and tallow, for slaughtering cattle outside 
and not inside the walls. Butchers and other offending trades- 
men were unwilling to move into the suburbs, where, it was 
alleged, evil-doers dwelt. There were petitions also for the 
punishment—the real not merely formal punishment—of bakers 
and brewers who broke the rules, demands that strangers should 
be allowed to sell food unimpeded,’ and not food only but cloth 
1 Whereas that of the Hustengs Court was slow and cumbrous. On 
the practice by which a layman “ ceded his action”’ against another 
layman to a clerk, and thus gave the Chancellor a jurisdiction to which 
he was not entitled, see Mr. Salter’s note (Ib. xxiv—vi). 
2On the freedom which the Oxford market enjoyed from the Royal 
clericus mercati, see Mr. Salter’s note (Med. Arch. I, 176). The consumer 
was protected to some extent against excessive prices first by the regu- 
lations of the guilds, later by the courts-held under the Statute of 
Labourers, and by the courts held for the assizes of bread and ale. 
(Ib. II, 129-30.)

for complaint against each other. Later on, in°1449 we find the man-

and linen, vain sighs on the part of over-charged consumers for 
dim ideals of freedom in trade. The control of bread and ale was 
an ancient source of trouble. Ever since 1248 the University 
had claimed with the King’s sanction to be present at the assize,+ 
and had constantly complained of the way in which the townsmen 
evaded their obligations. In 1324 the King granted the custody 
of the assize to the Mayor and Chancellor jointly: the two 
officials could not, however, always agree as to the time and 
place. The friction went on. But after the riot of 1355 this 
long-standing quarrel was settled, and the Chancellor at last 
secured in both cases the custody of the assize alone. At the 
same time he secured the supervision of market offenders, of 
meat and fish unfit for human consumption, and of those 
mysterious forestallers and regrators whose dealings were a 
constant source of suspicion to the medizval world.? In theory 
the liberties of the town remained. But in most points vital to 
ciple of Durham College declaring that the Oxford bakers gave the 
townsmen 13 to the dozen and the clerks only 12, and Parliamentary 
Petitions accusing the Chancellor of abusing his powers. (See Collectanea, 
II, 56, and III, 103-4, 117-18, 122-3, 126, 135-6, etc.) 
1 The King granted this in 1248, 1255 and 1301. The two franchises 
were never separated, but the court for the trying of bread was held at 
least twelve times, and the court for the assize of ale only twice, every 
year. The rent paid for the double assize was 100 shillings a year. 
Its profits were worth more and went to the Chancellor or perhaps in 
part to the Proctors. In the fifteenth century the rent was reduced to 
a penny, Edward IV confirming on this point the grant of Henry IV 
(Med. Arch. II, 140 and 286). I owe these details chiefly to the full 
and interesting account of the Assize of Bread and Ale printed by Mr. 
Salter from the University Archives (Med. Arch. VI, 129 sq.). For the 
Assay of Weights and Measures see the same volume (266-7). See also 
Med. Arch. (I, 153-4 and earlier references passim), Mun. Civ. Oxon. 
(34-5, 37-8, 53-4, 59-60, 63-4, 72-4 and 86), and Ogle (Royal Letters, 
60-4 and 329). It is not easy to say how far the control of ale carried 
the control of wine. It was probably not included in the early grants. 
2 Dr. Murray’s Dictionary defines a forestaller as one who buys up 
goods before they reach the public market, and the King’s Writ of 1320 
printed by Mr. Salter (Mun. Civ. Oxon. 31-4) throws light on this. Dr. 
Murray’s definition of a regrator as a middleman who collects goods 
from the producer and brings them to market is not so complete, and 
should be compared with Mr. Salter’s valuable note (Ib. xxii-iv). The 
regrators, who, unlike the forestallers, were of real use to the public, 
seem to have been small dealers, who put in their windows—or whose 
wives put in their windows—what they wished to sell, mostly articles 
of food, and sold them to the public between market days. Their num- 
ber was limited by agreement to 32. The town was interested in increasing 
the number—Twyne notes that early in the fourteenth century the 
number increased to 100 (IV, 67)—because it levied a charge of 15d. on 
every regrator’s window. The University laboured to keep the number 
down, apparently on the curious theory that if there were too many 
regrators, they would not be able to make a living without charging too 
much. A regrator of beer was a publican (Med. Arch. I], 183).

  166 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
its administration and prosperity, the Chancellor’s ascendency 
was now practically supreme. 
If the privileges of the University grew at the expense of the 
town, they grew also at the expense of the Bishop. The conflict 
of interest which had appeared in the days of Bishop Lexington, 
developed quickly in the days of Bishop Sutton. On the part 
of the Bishop of Lincoln we have grumbling protests against the 
University’s usurpations. On the part of the University we 
have successful, if sometimes barefaced, assertions of its claims. 
In 1280 Congregation insisted that the Chancellor had possessed 
from time out of mind the right to deal with suits between 
scholars and laymen, with the probate of scholars’ wills, with 
inquisitions into their morals, and with contracts made by Masters 
within the University. It is astonishing how much unproved 
assertions imposed upon the medieval mind. The Chancellor 
and Proctors improved on this with the ingenious theory that 
the Bishop had only an appellate jurisdiction in cases of morals 
when resort to the Chancellor and to Congregation had failed.? 
Sutton did not willingly surrender his claims. He summoned 
the University officials to answer for contempt of his visitatorial 
powers. He interfered with the University’s jurisdiction. He 
refused to confirm the Chancellor by proxy, and insisted on his 
appearing before him—a demand which led to a sharp quarrel 
and a cessation of lectures at Oxford. He objected to the 
University speaking of electing its Chancellor at all. The 
Archbishop had to warn him that the University would not 
submit to this ‘‘ unwonted bondage.’ King and Parliament 
had to intervene. Even when Bishop Sutton ungraciously 
yielded, the controversy went on. Bishop Dalderby early in 
the fourteenth century protested against the University’s “ con- 
spiracies’’ and usurpations. He made difficulties about con- 
firming the Chancellor, reminding the Masters that they could 
only nominate, that it was for the Bishop to appoint. He 
threatened with excommunication all who made Statutes to the 
prejudice of his See. But the University was not to be dismayed. 
In 1322 it claimed the right to depose its Chancellor, as well as 
to elect him, and the Bishop agreed to revoke the appointment 
apparently without demur.? When a new Chancellor needed 
confirmation, it became a point of honour for the Bishop to ask 
1See the agreement of 1281 between Bishop Sutton and the Univer- 
sity (Med. Arch. I, 37-9). Sutton, says Dean Rashdall (II, 423-4), was 
“‘the last Bishop who seriously attempted to interfere with the ordinary 
course of appeal from the Chancellor’s Court to the Regent Congregation 
and thence to the full Congregation of Regents and Non-regents.”’ 
2 And was even careful to stipulate that in so doing he did not seek to 
acquire any new right. (See his letter in the Archives, I, 8, and Salter’s 
Med. Arch. I, 105-6 and note.)   
 
-P-A-G-E-198

why he had not come to seek it, to protest against his absence 
and to insist that it was only “by special grace” that he 
confirmed him at all. But this formula satisfied the dignity 
of both sides, and was generally accepted for some fifty years.+ 
In 1350, however, an unwise Bishop reopened the question. The 
University, now fortified by precedents, appealed to the Arch- 
bishop to interfere. Archbishop Islip told his Diocesan sharply 
to confirm the Chancellor within six days. Not only that, he 
confirmed him himself, when the Bishop refused. And though 
a pretty quarrel followed, in which the angry Bishop cited his 
superior to Rome, the Pope sanctioned the strong action of the 
Primate. In 1367 Urban V went further. He dispensed with 
the need for confirmation altogether. Legitimate election of 
the Chancellor by the Regents of the University was declared 
to be enough.* The University had at last emancipated itself 
from the Bishop’s control. 
The Archdeacon of Oxford could not expect to be more 
successful than the Bishop in arresting the growth of the 
Chancellor’s power, and a long dispute in the fourteenth century 
ended in giving the Chancellor archidiaconal jurisdiction over 
his scholars. But the Archbishop of Canterbury sometimes 
proved a tower of strength when the University wished to 
challenge the claims of its old ruler at Lincoln. The Primate’s 
authority was not easily disputed. His views on doctrine com- 
manded obedience. He was always ready to listen to appeals. 
His Visitations were important academical events. He kept a 
watchful eye on the University’s proceedings, and he rarely 
failed, in early days at any rate, to encourage its independence.®

University’s privileges and promised to execute the Chancellor’s sen- 
tences of excommunication (Med. Arch. I, 35-6, and Mun. Acad. 39-41) ; 
and in 1348 he intervened, with the Bishop of Chichester, to settle a dis- 
pute between University and Town (Med. Arch. I, 336-41). 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
  168 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Indeed at the end of the fourteenth century Archbishop Courtenay 
acquiesced in a Bull of Pope Boniface IX, which exempted the 
University from the “ jurisdiction, dominion or power” of all 
Archbishops and Bishops whatsoever.?. But Courtenay’s suc- 
cessor, Archbishop Arundel, faced by the ‘“‘insolency”’ of ‘a 
company of boys,” found that this privilege went a great deal 
too far. He secured the help of King and Parliament in setting 
it aside. He induced another Pope to cancel it in r41z. And 
finally—but not till after a sharp struggle, in which the Arch- 
bishop found himself barred out of St. Mary’s and actually 
threatened with excommunication by the Chancellor—the 
Archbishop’s right of visitation was established, and the Univer- 
sity was made to feel the Primate’s power. Generally speaking, 
the Archbishop’s right to intervene in questions that touched 
the University was*admitted. It often proved a moderating 
and reconciling influence. It was supported by the Crown and 
by clerical opinion, and was rarely resented by the University 
itself. And the Pope’s intervention was sometimes useful too. 
The Popes showed themselves on several occasions disposed to 
strengthen the University’s position. They took an interest in 
its disputes and its studies. They interfered to grant degrees.5 
They rebuked heresies when heresy appeared. They received 
reiterated appeals from Oxford for benefices for scholars trained 
in its Schools, and they seem on the whole to have appreciated 
the importance of appointing men whose education would reflect 
credit on the Church. 
More useful still was the intervention of the Crown. Henry 
IV, it is true, supported Archbishop Arundel, and earlier Kings 
1 He even aided, says Dean Rashdall (II, 430), to procure it. 
2 Mun, Acad, (78-81): but Mr. Anstey misdates it 1300: it should 
be 1395. See also Twyne (II, 211-12 and 223-4), Wood (Amn. I, 365), 
Rashdall (II, 430). In 1396 the lawyers in the University protested against 
this Bull, and the King called on the University to renounce it (Wilkins, 
Concilia, III, 227, and Cal.’ P.R., 1397, p. 109). 
*See later (Chap. VI). See also Lyte (292—5), Rashdall (II, 430-7), 
and the references quoted by both. In 1479 Sixtus IV restored the 
University’s exemption from English ecclesiastical control (Wood, Amn. I, 
631 sq. and Reg. FF—Bodi. MS. 282, f.-74). 
«E.g. the Bull of 1246, ordering that all teachers at Oxford should 
be first examined-and approved by the Bishop or his deputy according 
to the custom of Paris, and the decree of the Council of Vienne, which 
Du Boulay (IV, 141) gives under 1311, for the teaching of Hebrew, Greek, 
Arabic and Chaldaic at Oxford and other Universities, In 1320 the 
Archbishop of Canterbury took steps to raise funds for a converted Jew 
to teach Hebrew, but Greek seems to have been dropped (Wilkins, Con- 
cilia, II, 500). The object was missionary rather than educational. 
5 Dr. Rashdall points out (II, 30) thatthe Archbishop’s power of 
giving degrees is a relic of the Papal dispensing power, (See also II, 
750-1.)

like Edward II and Richard II sometimes showed a stern front 
to University demands. But the Crown in general proved itself 
the Chancellor’s friend. It helped to enlarge his rights and his 
freedom. It encouraged him in resisting improper claims from 
Rome, in checking, for instance, the pretensions of an Archdeacon 
of Oxford who was also an Italian Cardinal and an absentee. It 
refused to allow the Chancellor to appear as a party in the Papal 
Courts. It recognised and enhanced the mysterious prestige 
with which circumstances gradually surrounded his office. And 
many of the men who held the post greatly helped to increase its 
reputation. Grosseteste was Chancellor in power if not in name. 
Richard of Wych was afterwards a Bishop and a Saint. Thomas 
of Cantelupe became Chancellor of England. Robert of Win- 
chelsey with all his faults was a great Primate, strong enough to 
win political victories even over Edward I. The University 
compared him, not inappropriately, with Becket : they were “two 
olives formerly planted in the University’s garden and after- 
wards transplanted to paradise.” 2 Richard Fitz-Ralph, ‘“‘ Arma- 
chanus,’’ was conspicuous both in the Schools and in the 
Church, a fearless censor of Mendicant abuses, a fore-runner of 
Wycliffe in philosophy, an Irish prelate whose bones worked 
miracles after death. Robert Stratford, who defeated the 
Stamford secession, was a brother of John Stratford Archbishop 
of Canterbury, and not only Chancellor of Oxford but Chancellor 
of England and Chancellor of the Exchequer. William Courtenay, 
who ruled the University in 1367, was a still greater personage. 
He became Primate, but he started life as a great-grandson of 
Edward I; and his nephew, Richard Courtenay, the opponent 
of Archbishop Arundel, was the dear friend of Henry V. 
Great churchman as he was, the Chancellor was not necessarily 
in Holy Orders. The Regent Masters who elected him usually 
selected a Canonist or Theologian, and in a vacancy the senior 
member of the Faculty of Theology acted ex officio as ‘‘ Chancellor 
born.” But custom alone restricted the freedom of their choice, 
1 There were exceptions. John Wylliott of Merton in 1349 carried 
his election by force, and is accused of breaking open a University Chest 
and banishing a Proctor (Twyne, IV, 148, and Lyte, 170-1). John 
Lutterel in 1322 differed so seriously from the University that he was 
deprived of his office with the Bishop’s consent (Med. Arch. I, 105-6). 
There are references to Lutterel’s disputes with the University in Lord 
Harlech’s MS. (f. 155). 
2 Harlech MS. (155-6). Winchelsey was Chancellor of Oxford in 
1288. 
8 Fitz-Ralph was probably Chancellor in 1333, though Wood doubts 
it. (See Dr. Poole’s article on him, D.N.B.) Fitz-Ralph was a great 
preacher: there are 88 sermons of his in Bodl. MS. 144. He was often 
at Avignon. Among other tasks he laboured to reconcile the Armenian 
Christians with the Roman Church.

and they had power not only to make, but to unmake their 
nominee. If it were found that the Chancellor could not be 
relied on to do justice, the Proctors and Congregation could 
summon him to mend his ways or go.! In the Chancellor’s 
absence from Oxford, a Commissary or Vice-Chancellor might 
be appointed to discharge his duties? But his absence was 
steadily discouraged because of the ‘‘many perils” it involved.® 
He was, from 1322 at any rate, if not earlier, elected for two 
years : but he might be re-elected. It was not until the fifteenth 
century that his office became permanent, that he ceased to be 
resident in Oxford, and that the Vice-Chancellor nominated by 
him stepped into his shoes. 
But this elective Sovereign, depending on the Masters and 
yet owing his independence to them, was a real Sovereign while 
he reigned. His powers were large, his dignity undoubted. The 
silver seal and chain, the silver cup, the measures for grain and 
cloth and liquor, the weights and scales, the hammer and anvil, 
the copies of Bulls damning heresies and errors, all presented 
to him on his installation together with the volume of Statutes 
which he had to interpret and apply, * were symbols of an authority 
which carried further every day. Not only the town, but the 
University came more and more under his control. He could 
vary and dispense with the Statutes of the Halls. He exacted 
sureties’ from their Principals. He could in certain cases 
remove them.* He could suspend Masters from lecturing and 
prevent students from taking degrees. Traders had to satisfy 
his standards. Craftsmen solicited his sanction for their regula- 
tions. Disorderly characters, male and female, fell under his 
scourge. His jurisdiction, built on wide ecclesiastical founda- 
tions, included the powers of an Archdeacon and of a Justice of 
the Peace.” The Mayor and Bailiffs of the town were bound to 
1 Mun. Acad. (108-9). The Proctors and Regents would first invite 
him to repair his errors. If he proved obstinate, the Non-Regents would 
then be called in to help to depose him. Mr. Anstey gives a “ Forma 
electionis Cancellarii ”’ (493), which, Mr. Gibson tells me, is in the oldest 
hand of Reg. A. It is found also in D, C and B. 
2 The oldest University account-book preserved in the Archives gives 
details of the expenses incurred on a business journey of the Chancellor 
in 1358. (See Mr. Gibson’s paper in the Eng. Hist. Rev. for Oct. 1909, 
and Med. Arch. I, 175 sq.) 
* Mun. Acad. (127). He lost his office if absent from Oxford in full 
term for a whole month, unless he had a good excuse, or was specially 
exempted, like Robert Stratford. The perils of absence were of course 
dwelt on when the University wanted an excuse for refusing to obey 
the summons of the Bishop of Lincoln.

help him in arresting offenders. The Sheriff was bound to 
imprison them on his demand. A Charter of Richard II forbade 
the King’s judges and officials to try suits which belonged to the 
Chancellor's Court.2, A Charter of Henry IV defined and en- 
larged his jurisdiction. It was to extend from Godstow Bridge 
on the North to Bagley Wood on the South, and from Botley 
on the West to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital on the East.? Eccles- 
iastical privileges ended fitly at an institution which enshrined 
the comb of Edward the Confessor, long famous as a cure for 
headaches, St. Stephen’s bones, St. Andrew’s rib and St. Bartho- 
lomew’s skin. And five years later, in 1406, King Henry gave 
the University a further privilege. In spite of protests from the 
town and the county, which found an echo in the House of 
Commons, he transferred to a new officer appointed by the 
Chancellor, the Seneschal or Steward of the University, the right 
of trying for felony and treason members of the University, 
privileged laymen and dependents, who did not enjoy the im- 
munities of clerks.* 
A curious miscellany of charges is to be found among the 
cases which came before the Chancellor’s Court. Scholars, 
Masters, Principals of Halls are summoned for all sorts of offences, 
not excluding failure to pay rent. Their violence is punished. 
Their possessions are noted. Their wills are proved. Their 
incontinence is checked.’ Townsmen are quite as faithfully 
dealt with. Beer and bread are constantly in question: their 
quality has to be closely watched. All taverners are made to

2 Med. Arch. (I, 221-2). 
3 Ib. (226-30). 
4 Ib. (231-4). These privileged servants and traders are enumerated 
in the important indenture of 1459 (Ib. 243-6). They included among 
others stationers, book-binders, writers, barbers, manciples, cooks, laun- 
dresses, carriers, etc. When clerks lost their ecclesiastical privileges at 
the Reformation, all members of the University fell into the category 
to whom the Steward’s jurisdiction applied. (See Rashdall, II, 409-11.) 
Henry’s Charter in the University Archives (A.1.) speaks of the “ malice 
of the lay folk of the town,” and includes counts of treason, insurrection, 
felony and mayhem. Clerks convicted of serious offences at Assizes 
were surrendered to the Bishop before the Reformation, and then punished 
by ecclesiastical law. (See also Cal. of Charter Rolls, 1341-1417, pp- 
430-1, and Registrum Privilegiorum, 1770, p. 47.) The High Steward’s 
Court still exists. It may be added that the townsmen on their side 
had a remarkably large number of servants, many of them apparently 
engaged in brewing ale. See Mr. Salter’s comments on the Poll Tax of 
1380 and the Statutes of Labourers (Med. Arch. II, xvii). 
5A charge of this nature brought in the fifteenth century against 
the Master of the Great Hall of the University was, happily, quashed 
(Register Aaa, £. 6). This, the first Register of the Chancellor’s Court, 
1434-1469, has been prepared for the Press by Mr. Salter,

take an oath on the Gospels at St. Mary’s to brew nothing but 
good beer. A long and bitter experience was needed to shake 
the medizval churchman’s belief in the efficacy of oaths. Sellers 
of bad meat have to be punished, an attempt to make a corner 
in fish put down. Brawls, assaults and the carrying of weapons 
constantly give rise to trouble. There are quarrels over debts 
and pledges, quarrels over procedure, quarrels over games. There 
are violent quarrels, in which laymen flee to Broadgates Hall for 
sanctuary, or angry clerks break each other’s heads. And there 
are trivial quarrels, like the one in which a venerable Canon on 
the one side and a schoolmaster and his wife on the other are 
forbidden to indulge in abuse and making faces, and sentenced, 
by a happy touch of humour, to entertain each other at dinner 
with a goose. 
The orders of the Court are widely varied. They are some- 
times petty and inquisitorial. They explore every corner of 
University life. There are orders exacting sureties for good 
behaviour, orders binding servants on oath to observe their 
indentures, orders permitting inn-keepers to erect ovens, orders 
limiting expenses in the Schools, orders even settling the amount 
of parishioners’ offerings at St. Peter’s in the East. A Friar is 
degraded and banished for libelling two Bachelors of Theology 
in a sermon. A writer is accused of falsely and cunningly 
attaching a new document to an old seal. A schoolmaster, 
threatened with excommunication, is imprisoned for conspiring 
with a multitude of scholars to snatch the sentence from the 
priest’s hand and to drag him from the pulpit. A Master, falsely 
defamed as a Scotchman, produces witnesses to prove his English 
birth. There are little details of personal delinquency, illustra- 
ting the closeness of the inquisition into conduct and the simple, 
child-like side of medizval life. From time to time inquiries 
into morals were held by representatives of the University in 
churches. Townsmen as well as scholars came under review, 
and juries of citizens gave evidence as to their neighbours’ faults.1 
Afmanciple® is punished for dicing and gaming all night. A 
Civil Law scholar is accused of entering a manciple’s house and 
banging his wife. A-laundress is charged with committing evil 
deeds under pretence of washing. A Vicar is sworn not to pay 
suspicious visits to a tailor’s wife. An organ-player of All Souls, 
1The University divided the town into districts, and appointed a 
Doctor of Theology and two Masters of Arts in each, to conduct the 
inquiry and report to the Chancellor’s Court. The inquisition, beginning 
with clerks, was gradually extended to townsmen. It may have been 
founded on the episcopal inquisitions of an earlier day (Rashdall, II, 
412). 
2A manciple was of course an officer or servant chiefly concerned 
with the supply of provisions.

convicted of incontinence, weeps so bitterly when sent to prison 
that he is promptly forgiven and let out.1_ A student has to pay 
fourpence for drawing his dagger against a Proctor. An inn- 
keeper at the Cardinal’s Hat has to make good the value of a 
horse which he has allowed a couple of Welsh students to purloin. 
Tailors who scamp the material for the Bedels’ and the Masters’ 
clothes are threatened with imprisonment. Women in the Middle 
Ages were sometimes harshly treated, and women offenders are 
not overlooked. Agnes Petypace, who has extreme views on 
domestic discipline, is bound over not to beat her servant more 
than decency permits. Margery Snow is banished for breaking 
prison. Margaret Curteys? is pilloried for worse offences. The 
pillory itself became a grave subject of contention. In 1325 the 
Mayor presumed to move it without consulting the Chancellor 
first. The Chancellor excommunicated the offender. The Mayor 
appealed to the Regent Masters against him. Finally by a com- 
promise the pillory was moved again and re-erected just six 
feet nearer the North Gate. 
In most cases the mildness of the penalties inflicted is as 
noticeable as the fatherly discipline enforced. Banishment 
beyond the limits of the town® seems to have been the severest 
punishment. Imprisonment, fine, penance, excommunication, 
the pillory—for townsmen—above all, the giving of sureties for 
good behaviour and the practice of clearing a man’s character 
by oath, were the favourite methods of securing justice. The 
main object was to induce an offender to confess his fault and to 
amend in future. Promises of reformation were accepted with 
generous credulity. Hard swearing, the oath of a man’s friends 
at compurgation, was trustfully treated as equivalent to proof.4 
Arbitration was as popular as compurgation. Aggrieved parties 
were exhorted to be content with compromise and reconciliation, ~ 
as children are taught to kiss and make friends. It was only by 
degrees that the grave abuses of compurgation were acknow- 
ledged, and the superiority of pecuniary fines allowed. 
The system was, no doubt, imperfect and hardened offenders

ing of one extract in Mun. Acad. (631-2), for which Mr. Anstey is not 
responsible, suggests.

174 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
took advantage of its faults. But it is probable that the clerks 
of Oxford were more often made amenable to punishment than 
the clergy in the ordinary ecclesiastical Courts. As cases for 
decision multiplied, the Courts held by the Chancellor and his 
deputies increased. A Regent Master might decline to plead 
except before the Chancellor or his Commissary. But the 
Hebdomarii, the weekly judges, were kept busy with minor cases, 
and Bachelors of Canon Law and Civil Law were called in to 
help the Doctors to get through them. From these inferior 
Courts appeals were frequent, first to the Chancellor (or his 
Commissary), then to the Congregation of Regents, and then to 
the whole body of Regents and Non-Regents. Beyond that an 
appeal could be carried in civil cases to the King, and in spiritual 
cases to the Pope. Clerks were reputed a litigious race, but it 
seems that they were on their guard against the lawyers they 
employed. Penalties had to be provided to check needless 
litigation, delays, obstruction, frivolous appeals. University 
legislation did its best to insist on the speedy decision of cases, 
and to check the “ unbridled multitude of advocates,” who for 
the sake of gain encouraged law-suits and suppressed or hid the 
truth. The right of appeal to the Bishop of Lincoln, which the 
University at first was ready to admit as a means of getting rid 
of his immediate interference, fell into disuse as its independence 
increased. The Archbishop of Canterbury’s right to intervene, 
and to call up cases into his Court, was more readily acknowledged, 
especially as a counterpoise to the Bishop’s claim; and the 
University did not hesitate to petition the Archbishop for his 
patronage and assistance when it was desired. But the appellate 
powers usurped by Congregation, on the plea of ancient customs 
which had no origin in fact, vested large powers of spiritual 
jurisdiction in an assembly whose members had in many cases 
no ecclesiastical standing at all.* 
1See Mun. Acad, (231-2). See also Ib. (19 and 356, 69-77, 260, 
460-1 and 465). Mr. Salter prints (Med. Arch, I, 190-1) a King’s Writ 
of 1367 forbidding appeals ‘‘extra regnum,” that is to Rome. The 
appeals in Oxford were heard by delegates of the two Congregations, 
representing all the Faculties. This old right of appeal was last resorted 
to in 1844. In 1894 an Order in Council substituted for it an appeal 
from the Vice-Chancellor’s Court to the Queen’s (or King’s) Bench Division. 
Dr. Rashdall has an interesting Appendix (II, 785-90) on the present 
jurisdiction of the Vice-Chancellor’s Court. 
2See Wilkins (Conc. III, 241-2), Lambeth MS. 221 (f. 172), Reg. 
Arundel (II, f. 91», cf. Twyne, XXIV, 121), and Epist. Acad. (13). 
* Rashdall (II, 438-9). The Dean points out (437) that the system 
of appeal at Oxford was copied from the system at Paris, where an appeal 
lay from the Rector’s Court to the Faculty of Arts and thence to the 
wiole University, although the circumstances at Oxford were entirely 
ifferent.

THE MEDIZVAL UNIVERSITY AT WORK 175 
Beside the Chancellor and closely associated with him were 
the two Proctors elected by the Faculty of Arts, one by the 
Masters of the South and the other by the Masters of the North. 
Primarily responsible to the Artists and to the Nations, they 
became the official representatives of the University as a whole. 
They were probably the earliest executive which it possessed. 
The Chancellor was at first a personage apart, outside the guild 
of Masters. Even when his interests were identified with it, and 
he became the recognised President of the Great Congregation, 
the Proctors retained in the Congregations of Regents some 
powers which a President would generally possess. They 
presided over the Congregation of Regents in Arts. They alone 
could summon that assembly. And to this day traces of their 
old position and authority survive. The Proctors had to assist 
the Chancellor in his functions. They had to carry out the 
Statutes. They had to superintend elections, to regulate 
academic business, to take part in graduation ceremonies, to 
administer the oaths. They had to keep order, to make lists of 
offenders, to see to punishments and fines. They had to supervise 
the University’s expenditure and the University’s accounts. 
They received its rents, no great matter, payments for Graces, 
fees for degrees, and other small sources of income.? They could, 
if united, effectively veto legislation : at first indeed one Proctor 
alone could do so by refusing to summon the Faculty of Arts.? 
They were the Chancellor’s assessors in most of his public acts, 
and they could, if necessary, summon Congregations to examine 
into his conduct and to remove him from office. It may interest 
undergraduate offenders, proctorised in modern Oxford for some 
minor iniquity of academic life, to remember that their task- 
masters once had no small power to break or punish the august 
Head of the University himself. 
Below the Chancellor and Proctors, but ranking in antiquity 
1The two Proctors were elected yearly soon after Easter by two 
Boards representing the Northern and Southern Masters of Arts. The 
Southern Proctor was the senior of the two (Mun. Acad. 81 and 485 
sq.). ‘To this day it is the Proctors who administer all oaths and 
declarations, who in the Regent Congregation submit graces to the 
House and in all Congregations count the votes and announce the 
decision ”’ (Rashdall, II, 365). 
2The average income of the University between 1464 and 1496 
was about £58. (See the Proctors’ Accounts printed by Mr. Salter, 
Med. Arch. II, 272, and for more details on this subject, later, 
Chap. VIII.) 
3 Mr. Anstey prints under 1304, and again under 1344 (Mun. Acad. 
81 and 146), Statutes empowering one of the Proctors with the Chan- 
cellor’s assent to summon a Congregation of Regents in Arts at St. Mil- 
dred’s, in spite of his colleague’s opposition. There seems to be no 
authority for the date 1304.

beside them, were the six Bedels.1 They also were elected 
officers, servants appointed by the University to execute its 
orders and maintain its state. They figured in all ceremonies, 
funerals included. They published proclamations, generally 
in Latin. They went round the Schools, giving out University 
announcements. They collected the votes in Congregation. 
They served writs, exacted fines, and escorted evil-doers to prison 
when they consented to go. Their dues and perquisites were 
settled by Statutes, which had to be repeated when the “ charity 
of the students grew cold.”” Three of them, who came to be known 
as Gentlemen or Esquire Bedels, were superior to the others in 
standing. They were expected to provide their inferior colleagues 
with food and with ten shillings a year for shoes. And these 
superior posts were evidently in demand. We find great person- 
ages interfering in the nominations. In days of corruption it 
was alleged that the posts were sold. In 1433 the four Superior 
Faculties attempted to nominate a Bedel, asserting that they 
were the ‘‘senior and saner part of the electors.’ But the 
Masters of Arts resisted and carried their candidate in.? Later 
on, Henry VI and Edward IV recommended candidates of their 
own. Henry demanded the punishment of two Bedels, who had 
“outrageously uttred”’ libels against himself, his “ wyf’’ and 
his son. And later still, in 1501, the election of an Oxford Bedel 
caused a sharp division in Royal circles.. The Prince of Wales 
and the Bishop of Lincoln supported one candidate. The Prince’s 
grandmother, the illustrious Lady Margaret, preferred another. 
The King and Queen encouraged a third.. The Lady Margaret’s 
candidate won, and the Bishop, who was also Chancellor of the 
University, was respectfully reminded that even Cesar, Cicero 
and Pompey had sometimes proved unable to oblige their friends. * 
The government of the University lay of course in the hands 
of the Masters. Strictly speaking, they were its only members.* 
At Oxford, it is true, the Non-Regents, the Masters who had 
ceased to lecture, had an authority denied to them elsewhere. 
They took part in the making of Statutes and in other important

from pedum, a stick (I, 194,n.). But Dr. Murray’s New English Dictionary 
does not confirm this view. 
2% See Mun. Acad. (321-3), and later (p. 339). John Came, the candi- 
date of the Faculty of Arts, received the votes of a majority of Masters. 
For the Bedels’ rights and duties see Mr. Anstey’s volumes, passim. 
Two Bedels were attached to the Faculty of Theology, two to the Law 
Faculties, and two to the Faculties of Medicine and Arts.

THE MEDIEVAL UNIVERSITY AT WORK 177 
University affairs. But the regular business of the University 
was largely in the hands of the Regent Masters; and among these 
the Masters of Arts—fons et origo ceteris'—took the lead. The 
Congregation. of Regents in Arts, sometimes called the Black 
Congregation, was summoned by the Proctors to separate meetings 
at St. Mildred’s. In very early days it established its right to be 
consulted first, and it seems probable that for many generations 
proposals to alter the Statutes and to grant Graces to individuals 
were submitted to this Congregation and discussed by it before 
they were adopted by the University as a whole. The Masters 
of Arts were wont to declare that a Statute which they disapproved 
could go no further. And though the other Faculties were 
unwilling to admit this, and claimed the right to disregard the 
recommendations made, it is at least doubtful whether in early 
days any Statute which the Faculty of Arts persistently rejected 
could have been insisted on by the Great Congregation or have 
permanently secured the University’s assent.2 As time passed, 
however, the authority of the Congregation of Artists diminished. 
In 1437 St. Mildred’s Church was partly pulled down. When 
College teachers increased in number, the Regents in Arts must 
have declined. Their separate meetings ceased. In the days 
of Queen Elizabeth the Black Congregation is spoken of as 
obsolete,? and its powers were evidently extinct.‘

‘The name “ Black Congregation "’ for the Regents in Arts seems to 
be used only once in the Statute Books, in a document inserted about 
1485 (see Mun. Acad. 481, where Mr. Anstey’s heading ‘“ Forma Cele- 
brandi Congregationem Nigram,”’ etc., taken from a seventeenth-century 
memorandum in Registrum B, is a mistake: the heading should be 
“Forma Congregationis Magne”). It is used three times in Registrum 
Aa (ff. 41>, 93" and 122), all between the dates 1450 and 1462. It may 
have been used little if at all in early days. I do not feel sure that the 
name “ Previous Congregation ’’ was ever used. Has it any authority 
beyond the phrase “ congregationibus artistarum previis ad congrega- 
tion Regentium et Non-regentium ’’ used in two passages in Mun. 
Acad. (81 and 146)? The suggestion that Non-Regents sometimes 
attended the Congregation of Artists is made three times in Mun. Acad. 
(8x, 146 and 188-9). But the words ‘et Non-Regentibus ”’ at the foot 
of p. 188 are a mistake; they are not in the MSS. And the words on 
p. 81, ‘ congregationibus artistarum previis ad congregationem Regen- 
tium et Non-regentium apud S. Mildredam faciendam,” which are prac- 
tically repeated on p. 146, cannot, I think, be correct. If we change 
into faciendis the word printed faciendam on p. 81 and faciendas on 
p. 146, the difficulty disappears. Ithink thisis therightreading. Except 
Reg. D, which gives “ faciendas,’”’ the MSS. use a contracted form. If 
this surmise is justified, there is nothing to show that Non-Regents 
attended the Congregation of Artists, and Dean Rashdall’s note (II, 374)

  178 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
The Congregation of Regents of all Faculties, the Lesser 
Congregation,! was destined to enjoy a longer life. In name it 
still survives. It met in the Congregation House at St. Mary’s. 
The numbers attending it may have varied a good deal.? It 
dealt with all kinds of University business, finance, administration, 
lectures, studies. It could make Ordinances though it could 
not pass Statutes. It could grant Graces, and out of its power 
of dispensing with the University’s requirements there grew in 
time the power of granting degrees. As time passed, its authority 
may have developed and increased. But it is not easy to draw a 
definite line at any given moment between the work done by the 
Congregation of Regents and the work reserved for the Great 
Congregation, or to say exactly what duties the Congregation of 
Regents could not, if it were necessary or convenient, under- 
take.* The Congregation of Regents and Non-Regents, the 
Full or Great Congregation, met in the choir of St. Mary’s 
Church. Its numbers were presumably the largest, but how far 
the Non-Regents attended it is difficult to say. This constituted 
the real Parliament of the University and was alone competent 
to make its laws. It survives to-day under the well-known 
name of Convocation which the sixteenth century apportioned 
to its use.* 
In the Great Congregation voting was by Faculties, and the 
Non-Regents voted like a Faculty together. The full solemnities 
of University legislation towards the end of the fifteenth century 
-are described in a eurious document in the Proctors’ Books. 
There were five days of elaborate ceremonial: first the promulga- 
would need amendment. It is clear from the context that the Regents 
mentioned at the beginning of the Form in Mun. Acad. (481) are Regents 
in Arts. The term ‘‘ Parva Congregatio’’ is also found, though very 
rarely. It appears from two passages in the Oriel Inquisition of Sept. 
1411 to be identical with the Black Congregation. 
1The name ‘‘ Congregatio Minor” is comparatively rare. It occurs 
only six times|in Register Aa, all in Jan. and Feb. 1456, and Mr. Gibson, 
to whose exact knowledge I am here again indebted, believes it to be 
unknown in the Statute Books. 
2 But see Registrum Aa (f. 122%), where a Congregation of 60 Regents 
in 1462 seems to be a full meeting, and the Merton Register (I, ed. Salter, 
155), where 18 Doctors and about 50 Regents are said to have attended 
a Minor Congregation. in Feb. 1492. Regents continued to lecture after 
the short period of Necessary Regency was over: but the number of 
Doctors here seems large. 
8 Even its inability to make Statutes mattered little, if Ordinances 
would serve the purpose. 
«The Non-Regents were probably difficult to get together, as the 
Preface to the Chancellor’s Book suggests. The Black Congregation has 
gone; but the Lesser Congregation of Regents still exists in the modern 
Oxford constitution as the Ancient House of Congregation, with the 
now purely formal power of conferring degrees. (See Rashdall, II, 
791-2.)

tion of the Statute in the Black Congregation, then the Assembly 
of the Masters at St. Mary’s and the election of scrutators, 
then the separate conclaves and discussions when the Bedels 
summoned the Faculties to deliberate apart, and finally the formal 
declaration of the decisions to which the Faculties had come.t 
During the discussions the Non-Regents occupied the Choir of 
the Church. The Theologians sat in the House of Congregation. 
The Canonists, the Civilians, the Medical men, and the Proctors 
with their own Arts Regents, met in different Chapels set aside 
for the purpose. The consent of the Regents in all four Facul- 
ties, Arts, Theology, Law and Medicine, was at first required 
for every Statute, and the consent of the Non-Regents as well. 
But at the beginning of the fourteenth century the principle of 
majority voting camein. The Friars declared that it was invented 
to prejudice them. But after the award of 1313-14 it was 
admitted that a majority of Faculties could bind the rest.* 
The Theologians and Canonists, the “most sacred’? Faculty 
and its ‘“‘ venerable handmaid,” claimed superiority of standing : 
and next to them the Doctors of Medicine and of Civil Law. 
But the Medical Doctors sat on the Chancellor’s right hand.* 
At times the separate Faculties seem to have exercised the right 
of making regulations for themselves. But in general the 
details of discipline and education were settled by Congregation 
for all Faculties alike. The superior Faculties had no Deans 
of their own, no clearly marked or organised independence.‘ 
The influence of the Faculty of Arts was always paramount ; 
and to that influence, accentuated perhaps by their own want 
of special opportunities or exertions, the decline of the higher 
Faculties at the English Universities is due. 
University education in medieval Oxford was a long and labor- 
ious business for those who sought the honour of a degree. In 
1 Mun. Acad. (481-3). The heading given by Mr. Anstey, as already 
explained, is wrong. ‘There is a later transcript of this document in the 
Chancellor’s Book. Three days or more if necessary were apparently 
given to the discussions and voting at St. Mary’s. The Canonists and 
Civilians were sometimes treated as two Faculties. Dr. Rashdall thinks 
that they generally appointed two representatives on University Dele- 
gacies, to which Divinity and Medicine each appointed one, and Arts 
four, but that in divisions they sometimes voted as one Faculty (II, 
375, 0.). His view as to the number of representatives is confirmed by 
Reg. Aa, under date 4 Dec. 1453. 
* See ante (pp. 73-5), and Collectanea (II, 218 and 226). 
® And the Civilians on his left (Mun. Acad. 234-5). This was a 
requirement of King Richard II, Academic opinion would scarcely 
have rated medical men so high. 
‘Dr. Rashdall notes this as “‘ the greatest constitutional peculiarity 
of Oxford ”’ (II, 447). In foreign Universities each Faculty regulated 
the conferment of its own degrees.

180 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
the earliest days there was no Matricula or list of students on 
which the names of all new-comers were inscribed.1_ No oath of 
obedience to a Rector was taken before they started on their 
course. The requirement that every scholar should place his 
name on the roll of some Regent Master was the oldest and 
nearest substitute for matriculation. Long afterwards Henry V 
enjoined that all scholars should within a month of their arrival 
take an oath before the Chancellor to keep the Statutes for the 
preservation of the peace.? The basis of education was Grammar, 
and Grammar meant the teaching of Latin. John of Salisbury has 
left on record his plea for classical studies as a foundation, rather 
than the sophistications of logic which even in the twelfth century 
were taking possession of the Schools.? The Psalms were learned 
first. Then Cato ‘supplied the universal reading-book. Donatus, 
Priscian and Alexander de Villa Dei® taught rules for parsing, 
scansion and philology. But in the early days, before its meaning 
narrowed, Grammar included a good deal more than that. Latin 
prose and French translation were a part of it. Latin verse is 
among the earliest school traditions we possess. - 
“Inter artes que dicuntur trivium, 
fundatrix Grammatica vendicat principium ; 
sub hac chorus militat metrice scribentium.” ¢ 
And the student of verse and prose passed on, not only to the 
delights of medieval disputation and to medieval authors like 
Boethius, but to Ovid and Terence, to Livy, Tacitus and Virgil, 
to Lucan and Persius and the classics of the past.’ 
Most of the boys who learned Grammar at Oxford were 
probably drawn from the immediate neighbourhood. Many

Bologna. Oxford was of course a University of Masters. At Paris 
individual Masters had their own lists.

Poetry, Section XXVII) dates it before the middle of the fifth century. 
It may be quite a century older. Caxton translated it into English prose 
in 1483, and even then described it as the best book for young children 
in school.

THE MEDIAEVAL UNIVERSITY AT WORK  18r 
a town in the Middle Ages had its own Grammar School, con- 
nected with some Monastery or Cathedral or church.1_ William of 
Wykeham founded a great Grammar School for his boys at Win- 
chester. Waynflete provided a Grammar Master at Magdalen, 
to teach the young Demies till they began their course in Arts. 
The Grammar Masters at Oxford may possibly have been in 
the earliest days under the care of the Archdeacon.? But very 
early in the fourteenth century we find the University asserting 
its control.? Two salaried Masters of Arts were appointed to 
superintend the Grammar Schools. The Grammar Masters 
made a yearly payment to the University, which in the fifteenth 
century was generally six marks. They received their licenses 
from the University, and in course of time Grammar degrees 
arose. But these degrees were not on the same footing as those 
of the regular Faculties, and they did not confer membership 
of Congregation.©> The Grammar Masters were responsible for 
the morals as well as for the education of their scholars. They 
entered on office by whipping a boy, who received a groat for his 
invidious “‘labour.’’ A cane® and a birch were their symbols 
of Inception. But many of them attained distinction. One 
of the most famous, John Leland, a kinsman probably of the 
great antiquary of later days, kept a school, it seems, at Peck- 
water Inn in the early years of the fifteenth century : 
“Ut rosa flos florum, sic Leland grammaticorum.” 
We hear of three Grammar Masters in 1447, but of only one in 
1464 and in 1477. About the middle of the fifteenth century 
there are said to have been five Grammar Schools in Oxford, 
Inge Hall, Lyon Hall, Tackley’s Inn, Cuthbert Hall and White 
Hall.” But before the end of the century these old schools

3See Mun. Acad. (85-6, 259, 354, 436, 440, 501-2 and 563-4). The 
two superintendents appointed in 1306 are said to be elected “‘ ut fieri 
consuevit.” 
«This payment and the superintendent’s salary sometimes varied ; 
but the latter is always 13s. 4d. in the fifteenth-century Proctors’ Accounts 
which we have. See Mr. Salter’s clear summary (Med. Arch. II, 278-9). 
5’ A Bachelor’s degree in Grammar grew up, as well as a Master’s. 
See Boase (Register, I, 3, 11, 14, 64, etc.), Clark (Reg. II, i, 8—where 
there seem to be one or two slight errors), and Rashdall (II, 599). School- 
masters could win Grammar degrees by composing some prescribed 
exercise, e.g. I00 verses in praise of the University. See Reg. G (143) 
and Boase (Reg. I, 64).

were dead or dying, killed perhaps by the new free Grammar 
Schools that were growing up. In 1492 the superintendents 
appointed by the University, who had no work to do for their 
pay, were made to act as superintendents of the disputations at 
the Austin Friars, where there was work to be done and no pay 
assigned.1 By that time, if the fierce criticisms of Erasmus 
may be trusted, Grammar Masters had degenerated abroad if 
not in England into a miserable race of men, ‘‘ hunger-starved 
and slovens in their schools,” deafened by noise, poisoned by 
foul atmosphere, aged and tormented by their crabbed studies, 
and using birch and rod remorselessly to terrify the boys who 
made their lives so hard. 
Once the elements of Grammar had been mastered, and often 
before their Latinity was adequate to their needs, students 
could enter upon the regular Arts course. The Trivium and 
Quadrivium, the Seven Liberal Arts of antiquity, were still 
the foundation of knowledge. Rhetoric succeeded naturally to 
Grammar: the limit between them is not easy to define. Logic 
or Dialectic overshadowed them both. Rhetoric helped to teach 
the arts of composition and persuasion. It included some 
training in the elements of law.2_ The oratory of Cicero was 
laid under contribution, the Rhetoric of Aristotle and the even 
more familiar writings of Boethius.? In the fifteenth century 
Rhetoric was largely associated with a study of the Latin poets. 
A degree in Rhetoric, ranking little above a degree in Grammar, 
was sometimes combined with a laurel crown. ‘‘ A Kyng to me 
myn habite gave,” sang John Skelton with a poet’s license. 
And whatever the degree was worth, it apparently qualified 
the holder to teach Henry VIII in his delightful boyhood spelling 
and the “ Musys nyne.’’ But as the teaching of the Schools 
developed, Logic with its syllogisms, its disputations, and its 
training in the methods of argument and thought, became the 
most engrossing subject of them all. 
At Oxford, however, to a greater extent than at Paris, the 
four Arts of the Quadriviwm—Music, Arithmetic, Geometry, 
Astronomy—held their own in the educational tradition. 
Boethius in his De Musica had set out to teach the theory of 
1 Mun. Acad. (363) and Med. Arch. (II, 279, 347 and 351). 
2 Particularly in Italy. ‘‘ The old division of Rhetoric into the three 
branches, ‘ demonstrative,’ ‘ deliberative,’ and ‘judicial,’ allowed the 
introduction of Law-studies under the last-mentioned category without 
requiring the addition of a new Art to the sacred Seven ’’ (Rashdall, I, 
103). 
3In 1215 the text-books at Paris may have been limited to Donatus 
and Boethius. . In fifteenth-century Oxford they apparently included the 
Metamorphoses of Ovid and “ poetria Virgilii’” (Ib. I, 434, and II, 457, 
and Mun. Acad. 286). 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
THE MEDIZVAL UNIVERSITY AT WORK _ 183 
Music; and musical theory, governed by considerations of 
proportion and arithmetic, was regarded in the Schools even 
more than its practice. Degrees in music ranked much on the 
same level as degrees in Rhetoric, and they also were late in 
date. They appeared in the fifteenth century at Cambridge and 
possibly at Oxford. But the first recorded Doctor of Music at 
Oxford was Robert Fairfax, who took his degree in 1511.1 
Bachelors were admitted to read a book of music.? Candidates 
for the Doctorate had generally to compose a Mass. Arithmetic 
owed much of its importance to the Calendar. It was of value, 
like astronomy, in fixing ecclesiastical dates. Reckoning was 
elaborate and difficult till the Arabic numerals came in. But 
Merton men helped to make mathematics popular at Oxford, 
and English mathematicians like John of Holywood and Bradwar- 
dine must have attracted thirteenth and fourteenth century 
students. Geometry was founded upon Euclid. Astronomy was 
based upon the system which Ptolemy had conceived. The earth 
was the centre of the Universe, and round the earth the sun, the 
planets and the stars revolved. Mathematics and astronomy 
were closely connected. The line between astronomy and astrol- 
ogy was very dimly drawn. The stars, it was thought, presided 
over science and ruled the destinies of man. An Oxford scholar 
was admitted to practise in astrology as late as Tudor days. 
The teaching of the Seven Arts was supplemented by the 
teaching of the Three Philosophies. Natural Philosophy opened 
up the world of science. Moral Philosophy taught the meaning 
and the limitations of duty, conscience, will. Metaphysical 
Philosophy peered into the problems of the origin and the future 
of mankind. And for all alike Aristotle was the teacher of 
supreme authority, ruling, since the re-discovery of his writings 
in the thirteenth century, not in philosophy only but in almost 
every department of thought. Text-books, no doubt, might 
vary, but Aristotle held the field. The logician turned to the 
Categoria and the De Interpretatione, to the Priora and Posteriora 
Analytica, to the Topica and the Sophistict Elenchi.4 The rhetor- 
ician depended on Aristotle’s Rhetoric. The natural philosopher 
1 And he, it seems, was only incorporated from Cambridge (Boase, 
Register, I, 78). Bachelors of Music appear a little earlier at Oxford, but 
I do not find in Mr. Boase’s volume any before 1505. See also Rashdall 
(II, 458) and Abdy-Williams (Account of the Degrees in Music at Oxford 
and Cambridge, especially Chap. II). 
2 Probably a book of Boethius. 
3 Rashdall (II, 458-9). See also Register H. (f. 4%), and the Merton 
Register (I, pp. 466-7).

Isagoge and the logical works of Boethius, Gilbert de la Porrée’s Sex Prin- 
cipia, and the writings of Priscian and Donatus. (See Dean Rashdall’s

looked to his Physics,! the metaphysician to his Metaphysics. 
For the student of Moral Philosophy his Ethics, Politics and 
Economics were an indispensable guide. Under the great name 
of Aristotle the Arts course prospered and grew. It is true that 
many of those who followed it may never have advanced as 
far as a degree. Yet the predominance of the Faculty of Arts 
was the basis of the University system, and it is of interest 
to follow the steps in the Arts student’s career. The crowded 
little Schools in the famous lane beside St. Mary’s were the 
centre of University life. The Masters sat at desks raised well 
above their audiences. The students, if they obeyed the Pope’s 
injunction, which is doubtful, sat in the straw or rushes 
on the floor,? so that “all occasion of pride might be taken 
away from the young.” More probably, like Edmund Rich, 
they sat on seats. Books were few, and viva voce teaching 
universal. The teachers read, the students heard, and might 
| or might not understand. Latin was of course essential. But 
many a student had to plunge into Aristotle before he had 
mastered the only language in which Aristotle could be read. 
For the first part of his career the Arts student was a learner 
only. He attended lectures, which started very early in the 
morning. He took part in exercises. He joined in repetitions, 
in detailed discussions of the lectures given. Ordinary lectures 
were originally the regular lectures given by Masters on the 
usual lecture-days.t They were given in the morning hours _ 
and in the recognised Schools. Extraordinary or cursory lectures 
analysis, II, 455-8, and compare his account of the Arts studies of 
Paris, I, 433-43.) There was little real change between the thirteenth 
and fifteenth centuries, but the text-books must have altered from time 
to time. In Paris in the thirteenth century we find the sceptical Liber 
de Causis, an Arabian work attributed to Aristotle ; and German Statutes 
mention other treatises like the Summule of Petrus Hispanus, and works 
on mathematics by Englishmen like John Holywood (De Sacro Bosco) 
and Archbishops Patcham and Bradwardine. 
1 De celo et mundo, De proprietatibus elementorum, De vegetabilibus et 
plantis, De animalibus, etc. 
2 Urban V in 1366 required all students of Arts to sit on the floor 
(Du Boulay, IV, 390). But students in the higher Faculties at any rate 
sat higher, and there is evidence that before the middle of the fourteenth 
century Arts students were demanding seats and desks. Mr. Gibson has 
drawn attention to the University Formulary of about that date preserved 
in the British Museum (Royal MS. 12, D, XI), which contains proclama- 
» tions by the Chancellor forbidding pushing and fighting for seats, noisy 
entrances into the Schools, unpunctual arrivals, etc. 
* At least the Lanercost Chronicle assumes this in a quaint passage, 
quoted in Collectanea (II, 187). 
«“ Legible ’’ days. Later on it was the custom at Paris for authorised 
teachers besides Masters and Doctors, e.g. Bachelors of Theology, to give 
ordinary lectures, even in afternoon hours (Rashdall, I, 427).
-P-A-G-E-216
  
  THE MEDIEVAL UNIVERSITY AT WORK 185 
were lectures given during the hours not reserved for ordinary 
lectures, and generally speaking in the afternoon. The distinction 
between them and ordinary lectures was primarily one of time. 
But they differed also in the men entitled to give them, and to 
some extent in the place and manner in which they were given.4 
Ordinary lectures were reserved at first for Masters or Doctors, 
and these authorised teachers might at different hours give 
extraordinary lectures too. But extraordinary or cursory lec- 
tures could be given by Bachelors, or by scholars of a certain 
standing admitted to lecture in order to qualify for a Bachelor’s 
degree. The difference between the two classes of lectures 
originated, it seems, at Bologna, and once corresponded with a 
distinction between the more essential and the less essential 
text-books of the law. At other Universities and in other 
Faculties the distinction between the subjects treated was less 
marked. But at Paris the term cursory came to be applied to 
the extraordinary lectures of Bologna, the lectures given out of 
the ordinary hours. And at Oxford, which adopted the Paris 
tradition, cursory lectures, with their greater freedom as to time 
and place and the standing of the lecturer, came to mean some- 
thing lighter and quicker in their methods, less exhaustive, it 
may be, in their treatment, at any rate less formal and elaborate, 
than the ordinary lectures of the Schools.? 
A thirteenth-century jurist once propounded a plan for a 
course of law lectures at Bologna, which may serve to illustrate 
the methods of the University teachers of the Middle Ages :— 
“ First, I shall give you summaries of each title before I proceed 
to the text ; secondly, I shall give you as clear and explicit a state- 
ment as I can of the purport of each Law (included in the title) ; 
thirdly, I shall read the text with a view to correcting it; fourthly, 
I shall briefly repeat the contents of the Law; fifthly, I shall solve 
apparent contradictions, adding any general principles of Law .. . 
and any distinctions or subtle and useful problems arising out of 
the Law with their solutions, as far as the Divine Providence shall 
enable me. And if any Law shall seem deserving, by reason of 
its celebrity or difficulty, of a Repetition, I shall reserve it for an 
evening Repetition.” * 
  
1It appears that they also differed sometimes in the matter of pay- 
ment. At Bologna a non-Doctor “ extraordinarie legens ” was forbidden 
to demand fees (Ib. I, 212). 
2 This subject, which has puzzled writers less familiar with the com- 
parative history of medieval Universities, is treated by Dean Rashdall 
with great clearness (see, especially, I, 207 sq. and 426-7), and I see no 
reason to doubt his conclusions. On the Arts student’s obligation to 
attend ordinary lectures on every lecture-day see Mun. Acad. (426-7). 
Masters and Principals of Halls had to report offenders.

(II, 219-20). He points out that there is no mention here of ‘‘a very

186 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
At Oxford, in the fifteenth century, the rules for lecturing were 
still substantially the same. A Statute of 1431 required the 
Masters in ordinary lectures first to read the text, then to expound 
it openly and fully, then to pick out passages calling for special 
comment, and then if necessary to start problems for discussion. 
But there was to be no wide wandering from the text, no inter- 
fering with the work of other Faculties, no trespassing upon 
forbidden ground.1 To analyse, to subdivide, to know the 
pros and cons of every argument, to be alert in disputation, in « 
posing questions and in suggesting replies—these were the arts 
which appealed to teacher and scholar alike. Long before the 
Middle Ages were over the students of Oxford must have had 
the debating instinct in their blood. ; 
After some two years of studies of this kind * the Arts student 
became a ‘‘ General Sophister.’’ He was then expected to take 
part in disputations, principally in logic, for at least a year, 
opposing and responding in the parvise.? Later on, in his fourth 
year, he had to face the test of Responsions, to dispute in grammar 
and logic with a Master, another important stage in his career. 
After passing that,° he was qualified to face the Board of four 
important feature of all medieval lectures—the reading of the ‘ glosses.’ 
By the Bologna Statutes the Doctor is required to read the ‘ glosses’ 
immediately after the text.” He adds that in Lent Repetitions were 
suspended and Disputations took their place. 
1 Mun. Acad. (288). 
2Sir H. C. M. Lyte says that, while grammar and logic were studied 
before Determination, and music, geometry, astronomy and moral philo- 
sophy after it, there was no fixed rule as to other subjects (206-7). But 
some natural philosophy was required before Determination (see Mun. 
Acad. 34; the [vel] interpolated there in the second paragraph should 
be omitted), and later at any rate some mathematics (Ib. 243). 
8“ Payvisum interim frequentantes, et se ibidem disputando, arguendo, 
et respondendo doctrinaliter exercentes ’’ (Mun. Acad. 242). Parvis was 
the term for the cloister of Notre Dame and of St. Pauls : Ducange derives 
it from Paradisus. Dr. Clark’s suggestion (Reg. II, i, 21) that in parviso 
means in parvisis or parvisiis, in little things like logic and grammar, 
must be set aside, together with the temptation to translate it “in 
smalls.”” The old phrase lingered on for centuries in the testamur given 
after Responsions. The Form for Determination in 1268 (not 1267) 
should be compared with that in 1409 (not 1408) in Mun. Acad. (34-6 and 
241-3). In 1412 the Form was found “nimis onerosa’’ (Ib. 260-1), and 
its modification ordered. 
«He became a ‘‘ Questionist’’ and had to respond to the “ questio.” 
These forms, no doubt, developed by degrees. If this form of Respon- 
sions can hardly be said, in Mr. Mullinger’s phrase (I, 353), to “ correspond 
to the present final examination,” it at least involved some test of know- 
ledge. 
§ In the thirteenth century there was an interval of six to eight months 
between responding to the question and determining (Mun. Acad. 35). 
But this was reduced later to a few weeks (Ib. 242).

Masters, elected for the purpose annually before the beginning of 
Lent, to satisfy them that he had read the necessary books and 
completed the necessary exercises, and to prove that he was in 
all respects, in learning, in conduct, and even in stature, a fit 
and proper person to “determine.” 1 Besides the candidate’s 
oath that he had been through all the processes required, the 
Masters must have had opportunities of taking evidence as to 
his character and knowledge, if not of examining him in his 
books: and witnesses had to be produced to testify to his 
attainments.2 But it is a singular fact that at Oxford and 
Cambridge, alone among the Universities of Europe, there is 
no trace at either Determination or Inception of anything 
corresponding to an examination in the modern sense. 
Determination was an imposing function, a rehearsal as it 
were, invented by the students, of the still greater ceremony 
of Inception ahead. It began on Ash Wednesday and continued 
for several days. The candidates were called on to dispute in 
the Schools, to defend propositions against all comers, to argue 
especially points of logic, to show the proficiency which they had 
attained. Their friends saw to it that they secured an audience, 
1The exact meaning of this term has been much canvassed. Mr. 
Mullinger’s explanation (I, 354), based on Dean Peacock’s, that, instead 
of disputing himself, as at Responsions, the candidate now presided over 
the discussion and gave his decision or determination on it, is accepted 
by Mr. Boase (Reg. I, viii), but is criticised by Dr. Rashdall as incom- 
plete. Yet the Dean’s definition—“ to ‘determine’ meant to maintain 
a thesis against an opponent ’—does not seem to cover the ground (I, 
444). The determiner, no doubt, had to argue. But may he not have 
crowned his argument by summing up the conclusions, the determination, 
of the debate ? The idea of a Bachelor finishing up his disputations as 
a student may possibly, as Ayliffe suggests (II, 120), have been included 
in the term. The phrase determinare acta sua is used in one ordinance 
(Mun. Acad. 240). See also Clark (Reg. II, i, 50 sg.) and Lyte (208). 
2 The Masters took age and even height into account (Boase, Reg. I, 
287). The average age for Determination at Oxford can hardly have been 
less than 19 or 20. The tendency at Oxford, as compared with Paris, 
was to make it later, and to reduce the requirements for the M.A. 
(Rashdall, II, 451-2). 
3 Mun. Acad. (34-5 and 243-4). The distinction between determining 
pro se and determining pro aliis is not easy to understand. To determine 
for others must have meant paying their expenses: it was the rich men 
who did it: and one would have expected them to claim some exemption 
from study in return. Yet both the earlier and the later Statutes insist 
on some additional reading in their case, if they have not already deter- 
mined for themselves (Jb. 35 and 243). On the other hand determiners 
for others could incept after two years more of study, instead of three 
(Ib. 416-17) ; and this may have been regarded as sufficient consideration 
for the expense they incurred. 
“On this point see Rashdall (II, 442-3).

and were even prepared if necessary to drag in the passers-by.t 
The bell of St. Mary’s summoned to these contests in the morning. 
The same bell, or the compline at St. Frideswide’s, stopped them 
in the afternoon. Masters watched over them and checked 
irrelevance in argument.? Success in disputation was the test 
of efficiency, the real equivalent of examination, in the medieval 
Schools. Brilliancy in debate at Determination might make a 
young man’s reputation. ‘Great is eloquence,’ said a Pope 
of the Middle Ages, ‘‘ nothing so much rules the world.’ ? And 
the importance of the trial, the publicity and ceremonial attached 
to it, the gatherings of friends and supporters, the costly gifts, 
carousing and festivities which crowned it all, made it a memorable 
event in a student’s life. At Determination he passed into the 
rank of Bachelors, secured, as we should say, his Bachelor’s 
degree. With the Chancellor’s license 4 he began to give cursory 
lectures to others, besides joining in disputations and attending 
lectures for himself. He became to some extent a teacher as 
well as a learner. The first part of his apprenticeship was 
complete. 
Four years of hard work were thus required for the Bachelor’s 
degree in Arts, and at that point, if not sooner, it seems probable 
that many Oxford students may have suspended their University 
career. But the final stage of Inception remained. Three more 
years at least of study, of reading and disputing, of ceremonies, 
festivities and charges, were needed to make a man a member 
of the community of Masters, to acquire the full license and the 
teacher’s rights.° During these years he took part in the dispu- 
tations at the Augustinian Convent, the immemorial ‘“‘ Austins ” 
which long survived the disappearance of the Friars. He delivered 
1 A very early order by the Chancellor, in the earliest hand in Reg. A. 
forbade this. 
2 In the fifteenth century, at any rate (Mun. Acad. 246). 
3 See Bishop Creighton (Historical Lectures, 197). 
4The license to lecture—on some book of the Faculty of Arts, and 
generally on Aristotle’s Ovganon—preceded the act of Determination ; 
and strictly speaking, it was this license, rather than the act of Deter- 
mination, which gave a Bachelor’s standing. The ceremony of Deter- 
mination could be omitted. It was usual, but it was not essential, before 
Inception. But the man who did not determine had to study for eight 
years in all—‘‘fere per octo annos”’ (Mun. Ac. 415—an early Statute, 
perhaps before 1350), ‘“‘adminus . . . per octoannos”’ (Jb. 417). I think 
eight years for non-determiners to incept in, and seven for others, may 
be taken as the rule, though the Statute of 1431 suggests that even 
determiners were expected to take eight years over the course (Ib. 285-6). 
It should be remembered that many students took more than four years 
to get the B.A. degree, and that the seven or the eight years were often 
exceeded. 
5 The clerk who did not proceed beyond the Bachelor’s degree was 
styled Dominus, in English Dan, Dompne or Sir (Lyte, 216).

the elementary lectures on Aristotle expected of him, and carried 
much further his own study of the philosopher’s works. When 
all necessary processes had been completed and he was ready 
to be received into the company of Masters, nine Regents, besides 
his own Master who presented him, were called on to speak 
from personal knowledge to his character and attainments. Five 
others deposed more generally to their belief in them.1 He was 
presented to the Chancellor, and kneeling before him he took 
the oaths required by custom,? and received in the name of the 
Trinity the license to incept, to lecture, to dispute. Then at 
last the way was clear to the final ceremony. The Inceptor 
engaged a School to lecture in.- He made a circuit of the Masters, 
accompanied by the Bedel of the Faculty, and invited them to 
his function and his banquet. He went through his “‘ Vespers,” 4 
another solemn disputation on the eve of the great day itself, 
and the presiding Master, the Father of the occasion, made a 
speech extolling his merits. Finally he appeared in St. Mary’s 
Church with a great concourse of Inceptors, Masters and specta- 
tors, in the presence of the Faculty which he desired to join. 
He rehearsed the ancient and elaborate ritual. He received 
the book, the cap, the ring, the kiss of peace. He delivered his 
inaugural address and joined in a last disputation. He took 
his final oaths, was hailed as Master, and proceeded to pay his 
footing among his new colleagues with feasting and expenditure 
which he could often ill afford.* The framework of the old Arts 
system was completed. The student, now a teacher and a 
1 Manners, morals, habits, all were taken into account. The ceremony 
of Inception was called the ‘“‘ Act.” The depositions were strictly confi- 
dential. The nine deposed de certa scientia, the five deposed de creduli- 
tate (Mun. Acad. 424). 
2 To obey the Statutes, to incept within a year, to keep down the 
expenses of Inception, to keep the peace, to use the University books 
as they should be used, to avoid the temptations of Stamford and other 
dangerous ideas, etc. (Ib. 374-6). The oaths never to consent to the 
reconcilation of Henry Simeon or to reassume the degree of B.A. were 
taken after Vespers (Lyte, 213-14). 
3 Mr. Anstey quotes the form of words from the Junior Proctor’s 
Book, and notes the large blot obliterating later the name of the Virgin 
(Mun. Acad. 383). The principal references to Inception in Arts in his 
volumes (285-8, 377-8, 382-3, 414-19, 424-6, 430-5) will be found better 
arranged in Mr. Gibson’s forthcoming book. 
4 But there might be an interval of some months before the Vesperie@ 
took place, Time-honoured buffooneries, like shaving the candidate’s 
beard, went with them. 
5 The actual ceremony of Inception was performed by a Regent of 
the Faculty concerned, and in the case of Arts students by the Senior 
Proctor. The license, as Dr. Rashdall points out (II, 446), came from the 
Chancellor, the actual Mastership from the Faculty. There were “ Acts,’’ 
degree-days, in winter as well as in summer.

Necessary Regent, could pass on to the higher Faculties, to the 
larger fields of thought ahead. 
For all the higher Faculties a further course of training was 
enjoined. We have little information before the sixteenth cen- 
tury in regard to Oxford medicine and medical degrees. Science 
was of slow growth in a world where Scholasticism ruled, and 
where wordy disputation was more valued than observation 
or research. The Northern Universities were even slower than 
those of the South to substitute experiment for dogma. For 
many generations astronomy and astrology were the most highly 
developed forms of science. Practically all the great medieval 
mathematicians ‘were astronomers. All medical science was 
supposed to be governed by the stars. For the arrangement 
of the Calendar astronomy was of course essential. Chaucer 
may not have been the only fourteenth-century father who 
“compouned’”’ an Astralobie ‘‘ after the latitude of Oxenford ”’ 
for his son, an Oxford boy.1 For fixing the date of Church 
festivals, especially the all-important date of Easter, astronomy 
had a high ecclesiastical value. For the Doctor it became no 
less indispensable, as Eastern superstitions gathered round the 
science of early Greece. ‘“ A Doctor without Astrology,” declared 
the medieval pundits, was like an eye without the power to act. 
Medical men “‘ must of necessity know and consider the natures 
and conjunctions of the stars.’”’* Even Roger Bacon thought 
that the most valuable of medicines, compounded in part of 
pearls and precious stones, should be exposed to the stars’ 
influence for eight days. And these ideas, linked with the 
attractions of Scholasticism and the timidity of the Church, 
long prevented medical science from developing in the right 
direction. Surgery was generally undervalued. The Doctors 
of Paris in the fourteenth century, and probably the Doctors 
of Oxford also, thought it a degrading manual art. Surgeons 
at Oxford could secure a license to practise, but could not secure 
even an inferior degree. They ranked little if at all above 
the apothecaries and. spicers who ,sold roots and balsams in 
the High Street. Anatomy was dreaded, though at Salerno as 
early as 1238 Frederick II had ordered the dissection of a corpse

Christopher Wordsworth, O.H.S., p. 13), Bodl, Quart. Rec. (II, 238), and

on Mediaval Astronomy (in Vol. II of the Studies in the History and Method 
of Science), which is based largely on’M. Pierre Duhem’s Systéme du 
Monde, and Mr. Gunther’s volumes which illustrate, in the fourteenth 
century especially, the importance of Early Science in Oxford. Dr. 
Singer’s Early English Magic and Medicine has some interesting side- 
lights on the medical beliefs of the early Middle Age.

THE MEDIZ:VAL UNIVERSITY AT WORK _ tor 
every five years. At Florence, when dissections were permitted, 
it was found necessary to sustain Professors and students with 
spices and wine. A great fourteenth-century Doctor at Mont- 
pellier mocked at the Northern physicians, who knew all about 
the Universal and the technicalities of logic, but who knew 
nothing of practical experiments and could not carry through 
a single ordinary cure.? 
The Greeks indeed had bequeathed to their successors 
traditions which would have taught them better ways. Alone 
among the nations of antiquity they understood that a science 
of medicine must depend on observation, not on theory. 
Hippocrates, the Father of Medicine, ‘‘ the divine old man,” 
as Sydenham called him, had invented the inductive method 
some four hundred years before the Christian era. His appeal to 
experience, his collection of cases, his high and noble ideal of 
his calling, and the teaching inherited from him and his followers, 
were the foundation of medical science down to modern times. 
Galen, who followed five or six hundred years later, overshadowed 
the history of medicine for a thousand years and more. Galen 
had the good fortune to propound views which were acceptable 
to most of the theologians of the Middle Ages, whether they were 
Christians, Mohammedans or Jews. His vast and wordy treatises 
contained for centuries almost all that medical students wished 
to know of physiology, biology, anatomy and botany.? His 
twenty-two volumes, with their Latin, Arabic, Syriac, Hebrew 
versions, filled the Schools. And even after Aristotle’s scientific 
writings had been re-discovered, and when their vast sweep in 
physics and psychology, in physiology and above all in biology, 
was partly understood, Galen continued to dominate the scene. 
Medizval philosophers, medical men included, could appreciate 
Aristotle’s treatises on life and death, on soul and sense, on youth 
and age, on sleep and dreams and waking, better than his con- 
tributions to biology and his invaluable observation of living 
nature. Schoolmen like Albert the Great might plunge into 
1b. (I, 246). 
2 7b. (I, 430, n.). Degrees in surgery could be obtained sometimes in 
Italy, and Bologna became an important home of anatomical science. 
Boniface VIII forbade the mutilation of corpses. But the practice of 
dissection was admitted in the fourteenth century at Bologna, Venice 
and Montpellier, and in the fifteenth century at Saragossa, and, no doubt, 
elsewhere. (See Puschmann, Hist. of Medical Education, tr. E. H. Hare, 
243 sq., and Rashdall, I, 245-7 and II, 133.) 
*Galen was born A.D. 131. His writings in fact contained, says Dr. 
Singer, to whose little volume on Greek Biology and Greek Medicine 1 
am much indebted (p. 69), ‘‘ the whole knowledge possessed by the world 
in the department of physiology from the third to the seventeenth cen- 
tury, nearly all the biological conceptions till the thirteenth, and most 
of the anatomy and much of the botany until the sixteenth century.”  
-P-A-G-E-223
  192 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
the study of botany with a vigour and discrimination not to 
be despised.1_ Arab commentators might contribute their in- 
genious learning: Arabic translations were the principal medium 
through which the medical science of Greece found its way 
into Western Europe.? But still, though science struggled, the 
cramping traditions of Scholasticism survived. The leaders 
of medicine still built their theories upon words. At Oxford 
at any rate it was long before medical science could throw off 
the swaddling-clothes of the Middle Ages. 
At Oxford there were lectures both on theory and on practice. 
Galen and Hippocrates were the foundation of the course. The 
Liber Febrium of Isaac the Jew and the Antidotarium of Nicholas 
of Salerno are mentioned,’? and other treatises must have been 
in use.t Most medical students at Oxford probably passed 
through the Arts training ; but an Arts degree was not essential 
for a medical man, though the inevitable disputations and the 
duties of responding and opposing were. It appears that the 
Bachelorship of Medicine, admission to lecture on a book of the 
Aphorisms, generally went with admission to practise in Oxford.® 
1 Albert probably drew some of his knowledge of natural history from 
the works of Michael Scot, a famous scholar and wizard of the thirteenth 
century, translator of Aristotle, abbreviator of Avicenna and astrologer 
to Frederick II. Bacon mentions his visiting Oxford in 1230, and Scot 
may possibly have been an Oxford student. Dante, Boccaccio, Sir Walter 
Scott and many others have contributed to his fame (see his Life by J. 
Wood Brown and D.N.B.). 
2 The profound influence on medical study of translations made from 
the Arabic in the eleventh and twelfth and perhaps the thirteenth cen- 
turies, largely at Monte Cassino and still more largely at Toledo, is shown 
in a valuable note by Dr. Payne quoted by Dean Rashdall (II, 780-5). 
“Most of the works of Hippocrates and Galen must, and all of them 
might, have been derived ’’ from such translations. For the predominance 
of Galen see the list of books chosen for lectures at Montpellier in 1340 
(Ib. 123-4). 
3 Mun. Acad. (406 and 409). 
‘ Besides Galen’s Liber Tegni (téyvn taro) and the Aphorisms and 
Regimenta Acutorum (negi dialtns d&éwv) of Hippocrates, other works 
of Galen, if not of Hippocrates, must have been well known at Oxford. 
Isaac and his disciples wrote on several subjects. The writings of 
Johannicius, Theophilus and Philaretus (sometimes identified with each 
other), of A°gidius, the great Parisian Doctor of the twelfth century, and 
of others, may have been known at Oxford, as at Paris and Cologne. 
The medical works of Avicenna and the Arabs, widely studied in Southern 
Europe, were less known, it seems, in the Universities of the North. 
Compare the information on medical studies at Bologna, Paris, Cologne, 
Montpellier, given by Dean Rashdall (I, 247-8 and 429-30, and II, 123-4). 
Sir N. Moore has some notes on the studies of John Mirfield, a London 
physician of the fourteenth century (Hist. of the Study of Medicine in the 
British Isles).

been so in the fifteenth century.

THE MEDLVAL UNIVERSITY AT WORK — 193 
It could be obtained by Masters of Arts after four years’ study ; 
others had to take a longer time.!_ In both cases an examination 
by the Regent Doctors was required.? The full degree of Doctor 
of Medicine, the license and Inception, needed even for Masters 
of Arts two years of further study, and it seems probable that 
these two years were partly spent in practical work.* If little 
hospital practice was available,t some attempts to deal with 
patients may yet have been made, and in the sixteenth century 
at any rate some slight experience of anatomy and some proof 
of cures effected was required.’ But even so the practical 
training must have been wholly insufficient. The Medical 
Faculty of Oxford, overweighted with theory and circumscribed 
by tradition, remained a small and struggling Faculty, although 
the Crown insisted on its being treated with respect. It was 
vain for Henry V’s legislation to try to confine the practice of 
the ‘‘ mysterie of fysyk ’’ to University men. Quacks, unlicensed 
practitioners, apparently flourished in the town of Oxford,* 
while in the University there was sometimes only one Doctor 
of Medicine available to teach.? There must of course have been 
able men drawn in all ages to medical study. At Merton 
1 Non-M.As. apparently needed eight years’ study for admission “ ad 
practicam in municipio Oxonie ” (Mun. Acad. 406), as long a period as 
they needed for the M.D. But the old Statutes are not too clear on all 
details. 
2“ Super practica ’’ (Jb.). But this may be only on the theory of 
practice. References to Bachelors of Medicine in the early Statutes are 
very rare. But there is one in Mun. Acad. (425). 
8 Dean Rashdall doubts (II, 454, n.), not without reason, whether 
either examination or practice was required to turn an M.A. into an M.D. 
But examination was surely needed (Mun. Acad. 406): and the admission 
to practise in Oxford two years before the M.D. degree must surely have 
been given in order to enable some practical experience to be secured. 
This seems to have been the custom at Cambridge. (See Peacock, 
Observations on Statutes, App. lii, n.) 
«The Hospital of St. John could not have afforded valuable facilities 
for medical training at Oxford. Dr. Singer reminds me that the medieval 
hospitals were intended for the aged, the infirm and the chronically 
ill, just those cases against which modern hospitals are on their guard. 
Still Hospitals existed. Paris in 1449 required Bachelors of Medicine to 
visit the hospitals or else to accompany practitioners on their visits. 
Salerno and Montpellier from an early age, Vienna and Ingoldstadt later, 
expected Bachelors of Medicine to acquire practical experience; and 
I think that this was probably the understanding at Oxford too. (See 
Puschmann, Hist. of Medical Education, tr. Hare, 253 sq.) 
5 See Hearne (App. to Trokelowe’s Annales Edvardi II, 347-8) and 
later (Vol. II,Ch. XII). But thecures may refer to cases of surgery only. 
6 “ Multi laici et illiterati practizantes”: they were to be punished as 
disturbers of the peace (Mun. Acad. 236-7). This Statute, of May 1400, 
needs re-editing, but its substance remains.

especially in early days the interest shown was strong. But 
it was not till the sixteenth century, till the control of the Church 
diminished and science broke its bonds, till medical lecturerships 
were founded in the University and the College of Physicians 
started on its life, that a new era in academic medicine began. 
Even then progress was far from rapid. Theories and formulas 
still played an abnormal part. To John Earle of Merton in the 
seventeenth century a ‘‘dull Phisitian’’ was still a thing to 
mock at. “ He is sworne to Galen and Hypocrates, as Vniuersity 
men to their statues (sic), though they never saw them.’’ His 
“discourse is all Aphorismes.” He “ tels you your Maladie in 
Greeke.”’ + 
Medicine and Law were popularly supposed to lead to a 
prosperity which philosophers could not hope for :— 
“Dat Galenus opes, dat Justinianus honores, 
Sed genus et species cogitur ire pedes.”’ 
But it was not by teaching in Oxford University that either 
lawyers or physicians found the way to wealth. There was a 
time, in the days of Roger Bacon, when Civil Law threatened 
to eclipse all other studies. But before the middle of the four- 
teenth century it is evident that that danger had passed away, 
and that very few Doctors of Civil Law remained in residence 
at Oxford.2 The Law Schools lectured on Justinian and on 
Gratian, on the Digest which revealed the spirit of Roman juris- 
prudence, on the Decretum, the celebrated twelfth-century text- 
book which had secured the triumph of the Canon Law. But 
in England the Law took its own course and trained its own 
disciples. The Civil Law of Rome was studied chiefly for use in 
the ecclesiastical Courts. And the Canon Lawyers who filled 
so many great Sees in medieval Christendom, and built up 
the authority of the Roman priesthood over the consciences of 
men, never secured the same influence in this country as they 
did abroad. The degree of Bachelor of Civil Law‘ at Oxford 
required four years of study in the case of Masters of Arts and 
six years in the case of other people. For the Doctor's degree 
two or three more years of lecturing and disputing were probably 
1 Micro-cosmographie (Arber’s reprint of 1869, 25-6). 
*The authorities could not count on as many as four (Mun. Acad. 
404; Mr. Gibson dates this before 1350). And there was apparently the 
same scarcity of Canonists (Ib. 399). 
8 Edward I’s grant of free lodgings in the Palace at Beaumont to 
Franciscus Accursius, the Bolognese Civilian, whom he brought to Oxford 
in 1275, is the first trace of any contribution towards the endowment of 
a University Lecturer (Rashdall, II, 460, n.). 
4 That is, the license to lecture on a book of the Institutes. See Mun. 
Acad. (402-5) and Rashdall (II, 454).

  expected,! and they were chiefly occupied in reading the Institutes 
and certain volumes of the Civil Law. Therules for the Bachelor’s 
degree in Canon Law were not less exacting. They did not 
stipulate for a degree in Arts.2 But they enjoined five years’ 
study of the Civil Law, of the Decretum of Gratian and the 
Decretals of Gregory IX and his successors. For the Doctorate 
it seems that two more years of studying, lecturing and disputing 
were required, and it may be an additional year for those who 
had not already taken a Civil Law degree. 
Doctors of Theology, the supreme science, needed still higher 
qualifications. For them sixteen to nineteen years of training 
were not thought too much, * though it must be remembered 
that the practice of dispensing with some of these elaborate 
requirements increased as time went on. Masters of Arts, 
with seven years of study behind them, had to work seven years 
more to become Bachelors of Divinity, to be admitted, that is, 
to lecture on the Sentences, Peter the Lombard’s indispensable 
text-book of theology, which was hardly second in authority 
to the Bible itself. Albert the Great indeed had assured his 
pupils that the Virgin possessed a summary knowledge of both. 
1 No time is specified. The chief books mentioned besides the Insti- 
tutes are the Digestum Novum and the Infortiatum. ‘The ordinance adds— 
‘Qui igitur de cetero legere voluerit instituta, libros saltem ordinarios 
apparitatos [juris civilis] proprios se juret habere, aut alienos ad minus 
sibi ad usum totius lecture suz in illa facultate absque fraude concessos ”” 
(Mun. Acad. 402-3). The words in brackets are added in Reg. A. 
2 But they, no doubt, presupposed an Arts training. 
* On Gratian’s great text-book and on the Decretals of Gregory IX, 
Boniface VIII, Clement V and their successors, see Dr. Rashdall’s 
interesting section (I, 128-42). 
“I think this is probably the meaning of the three material passages 
in Munimenta Academica, which are not very clear. P. 400 gives, as I 
understand, the requirements for the Bachelorship—three years of Civil 
law, two years on the Decretum, and the Decretals complete during the 
five years. P. 398 gives the requirements for the Doctorate, five years 
of Civil Law, two years on the Decretum, and the Decretals twice over 
meanwhile. P. 399 adds that Inceptors in Canon Law, who have not 
already ruled in Civil Law, must spend at least three years in Civil 
Law, two years in Bible study and three years on the Decretwm, besides 
hearing the whole of the Decretals. The Statutes are not well arranged, 
and a comparison with Paris or Bologna does not help. 
5 Sir H. C. M. Lyte adds two more years for the Necessary Regency 
in Arts (223). But did the M.A. who became a theological student wait 
till those two years were over to begin his theological training? It may 
be so; the Petre Statutes at Exeter seem to contemplate this (Boase, 
Ex. Regist. 1894, xc) ; and Necessary Regency was exacting ; it required 
twenty-four lectures a term. But if he did, he would lose most of the 
advantage which he gained in point of time by taking his Arts degree. 
The Statutes do not make this clear. The total period again might well 
be lengthened by students taking more than seven years for their M.A. 
degree. See also Reg. Ann. Coll. Merton. (xxvi). 
   
-P-A-G-E-227
    196 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
The seven years included a thorough study of the Bible and the 
Sentences. Opponency came in the fifth year. For the Doctor's 
license two more years of training were needed, more work 
upon the Bible and the Sentences, more disputations, the delivery 
of at least one public sermon,! Vespers, and all the solemn 
ceremonial which accompanied the Inceptor’s rank. Candidates 
who were not Masters of Arts, but who obtained leave to dispense 
with that requirement after the famous Statute of 1253, had to 
submit to a still longer process, and to, work for another two or 
three years.2. The Doctors of the supreme science were determined 
that its distinctions should not be too lightly won. 
Hardly less formidable than the tax upon the time of students 
was the tax upon the student’s purse. The costs of the whole 
elaborate system, of functions like Responsions, Determination 
and Inception, tended to be far too high. Some efforts were 
made by the authorities to check them. Statutes were passed 
forbidding gifts of robes and feasts and drinkings. But these 
Statutes were afterwards repealed, and it is uncertain how 
far the efforts to enforce economy were continuous or sincere. 
The fees for Arts degrees paid to the University were small, 
only one week’s commons for Masters and half that sum for 
Bachelors. We find a fifteenth-century Bachelor of Arts 
admitted for fourpence. We find Bachelors in Common Law 
asked for trifling payments, a contribution to repair a window 
in the House of Congregation, a noble for the pavement of St. 
1In Latin at St. Mary’s (Mun. Acad. 395; see also 391 and 396-7). 
More preaching, it seems, was required in the fifteenth century. But an 
English sermon at St. Peter’s in the East was preferred by some candi- 
dates to a Latin one at St. Mary’s (Rashdall, II, 453 and n.). 
2 Candidates who were not graduates in Arts required for the B.D. 
nine years of theology (Mun. Acad. 389) and eight years’ study of the 
liberal arts (Ib. 390)—making for the D.D. nineteen years at least. On 
the requisites for Theological degrees see Mr. Anstey’s work (203-4 and 
388-07). 8 William of Wykeham allowed his College to contribute towards the 
expenses of his poor scholars 13s. 4d. at Responsions and Determination, 
and 26s. 8d. at Inception (Stats. of Calls. I, New Coll. 52-3). But these 
figures must have been constantly exceeded. In the fourteenth century 
it could have been no rare thing for a degree in Theology to cost—when 
translated into-modern values—two or three hundred pounds. z 
4See Mun. Acad. (247 and 455). The date of the latter passage is 
1322. In 1478, however, there is some reduction again in the rules for 
expenditure (Ib. 353-4). Perhaps, as Mr. Salter suggests (Med. Arch. II, 
274), Cambridge was ‘‘ cutting the rates.” 
® The average receipts from this source at Oxford from 1464 to 1496 
—every year is not given—were only about £3 a year. (See the Proctors’ 
Accounts in Med. Arch. II, 273 and 275.) Mr. Salter thinks this indicates 
about thirty M.A. and forty B.A. degrees yearly. The receipts from the 
Doctors’ degrees, however, formed nearly half the University’s income 
(Ib. 274). But see Reg. Ann. Coll. Merton. (xxii).

Mary’s and another for the building fund of the new Schools. 
But the presents and perquisites required by custom, robes for 
Masters, gloves for Bedels, and above all the large and extrava- 
gant entertainments, were far more serious than the fees. For 
the higher degrees these costs were very heavy, though probably 
the charges varied and something was done to accommodate 
them to what candidates could afford to pay. A new Master 
of Arts was glad to escape the duty of feasting the Regents by 
paying twenty pounds, a considerable sum in the Middle Ages. 
In 1343 the Benedictines proposed to grant twenty pounds for 
each of their members who incepted in theology.* Even poor 
Friars were made to pay ten pounds, though the University 
denied this. A Prior of the Austin Friars at Oxford was probably 
fortunate to escape so cheaply.’ In the year 1400, we are told, 
the Convent of Christ Church, Canterbury, paid over a hundred 
and eighteen pounds for two of its members to incept in theology 
and Canon Law,® a sum which could hardly represent in modern 
money less than fifteen or sixteen hundred pounds. Such 
figures are difficult to credit. But the old limit for expenditure 
at Inception was very high,‘ three thousand gross Tournois,” 7 
1See Boase (Univ. Reg. I, 10, 2 and 5). 
2 1b. (I, 7). But the University on its side spent a good deal on 
feasting Inceptors. 
®See Wilkins (Concilia, II, 714 and 725). Each Inceptor in Canon 
Law also was to have a grant of 20 marks. But if more than one member 
of the Order incepted in the same year, these grants had to be divided 
between them. 
4 Epist. Acad. (352-4). It is to be feared the University quibbled. 
5’ Mun. Acad. (564-5). The Friar’s fee was reduced to 10 marks and 
the monk’s to 20 marks in 1478 (Ib. 353). 
® Lyte (225) quotes Tanner MS. 165 (f. 212). But see the computus 
in the Chapter records at Canterbury (O. 128). A century and a half 
later Ramus estimated the cost of the Doctor’s degree in Paris at 1,002 
livres for theologians and at 881 livres for medical men. (Rashdall, I, 
476.) 7“ Tria millia Turonensium grossorum ”’ (Mun. Acad. 383), or “‘ Turo- 
nensium argenteorum ”’ according to the Canon adopted in 1311 by the 
Council of Vienne. The latter phrase is used in the Cambridge Statutes 
(Peacock, Observations, App. A, xxi). What were these Turonenses grossi 
or argentet worth ? Dean Rashdall (I, 232) and other writers speak of 
them as “ pounds Tournois.” But if, as Mr. Wylie estimates (Hist. of 
Eng. under Henry IV, vol. IV, 285), the pound Tournois was worth 
22s. 6d. in 1400, the sum becomes incredible. In 1337 Benedict XII 
forbade the Black Monks to spend more than ‘‘ valorem duorum millium 
Turonensis argenti’”’ (Wilkins, Conc. II, 599). And in 1346 Clement VI, 
to solve doubts as to the English equivalent, decreed that “ quatuor 
Turonensium parvorum sterlingo Anglicano in pretio cozquari; ita quod 
sexaginta libre illorum Turonensium equevaleant libris quindecim sterling- 
orum ”’ (Ib. 734). Here the Tuvonenses parvi, spoken of as pounds, are 
worth 5s. each. But 2,000 of them would make in modern money an 
almost impossible sum. No wonder there were doubts about the meaning
-P-A-G-E-229
  198 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
which seems to have meant according to modern standards 
about five hundred pounds. Even by this limit some University 
students declined to be bound. Fine young gentlemen like 
George Neville of Balliol, who loved magnificent dinners, took 
full advantage of the regulations which refused to confine expenses 
too strictly.1 But wealthy Inceptors like Neville were allowed 
to pay the expenses of poor colleagues. Even Walter Paston, 
whom Lady Harcourt disappointed of the venison which she had 
promised for his feast, hoped to get some advantage from the 
fact that Lionel Woodville, the Queen’s brother, was taking his 
degree at the same time. The University, too conscious of its 
own niggardly endowments, was no niggard in allowing other men 
to spend. And the heavy charges must have operated strongly 
to prevent students in the higher Faculties from taking their 
degrees. 
The Masters who surmounted all these difficulties and entered 
on their career as teachers were not permitted to forget the 
obligations which they had incurred. They were bound in early 
times to hold disputations for forty days continuously, wearing 
their full academical ‘dress, and to lecture constantly as 
““ Necessary Regents’ for two years. The Mastership, it should 
of the phrase, which seems to have been almost as indefinite as some 
contemporary statements about numbers. But sooner or later for Uni- 
versity purposes in England the value of the “ tria millia Turonensium ” 
must have been fixed; and I see no reason to reject the estimate given 
by John Caius in 1574 (Hist. Cantabrig. Acad. 123), and based apparently 
on the Old Proctor’s Book at Cambridge, that the Turonenses in question 
were taken to be worth something over 3d. each, that forty-eight of them 
went to the mark and seventy-two to the pound, and that 3,000 of them 
equalled £41 13s. 4d. in Elizabethan money. This in modern values is 
about £500. The Commissioners of 1852 accepted John Caius’ calculation 
(Documents relating to Univ. and Colls. of Cambridge, I, 379) ; and so did 
Mr. Mullinger (I, 357). 
1See Registrum Aa (66%) and Boase (Reg. I, ix). Neville also sup- 
plicated for leave “‘ accipere ’’ (or “‘ acceptare"—Mumn. Acad. 731) ‘‘ sub 
se tot inceptores quot sibi placuerit.”’ 
2 Paston Letters (ed. Gairdner, III, 248 and Ixviii), 
The average yearly receipts from Doctors’ degrees, £26, between 
1464 and 1496, indicate very few degrees each year (Med. Arch. II, 273-4). 
But a list of graduates in 1414 (Linc. Episc. Reg. Repingdon, 136-7: 
Twyne, II, 13-14) shows a substantial number of Doctors and Bachelors 
of the higher Faculties, about thirty, apparently in residence at that 
time. 
4 Ib. (419 and 452). How old this obligation was, or how long it was 
enforced, it is difficult to say. It may have been partially dispensed 
with early. Sir H. C. M. Lyte (quoting Mun. Acad. 415) speaks of the 
one year of necessary Regency being ‘‘ afterwards lengthened to two 
years ’”’ (217). But the ordinance referred to only requires an Inceptor 
in Arts to swear “sibi provisum esse de scholis pro anno quo tenebitur 
ad lecturam,”’ and there is, I think, no proof that it is earlier in date than 
the ordinances requiring two years of lectures,  
-P-A-G-E-230
  THE MEDIZVAL UNIVERSITY AT WORK 199 
be remembered, was originally a vocation, not merely an honorary 
degree. The fees which the Masters collected! and on which 
their remuneration depended, were certainly not extravagant 
in amount. Twelve pence a year or three pence a term was 
paid for lectures in Logic. Eighteen pence a year was the 
minimum for lectures in Physics. Grammar fees were rather 
higher, eight pence a term *—perhaps the students needed more 
attention—and in the superior Faculties the charges were a good 
deal higher still. Masters as a rule were forbidden to remit 
them. The Statutes explain that, if a rich man lectured for 
nothing, poor men might be unable to draw the audiences 
which they deserved. In the fifteenth century the fees of all 
Regents in Arts were pooled and equally divided. But they 
were not always easily collected, and they were probably never 
large enough. The want of adequate salaries for teachers has 
hampered University teaching from the earliest days. Duke 
Humphrey of Gloucester established about 1436 temporary 
Lecturerships in the Seven Arts and Three Philosophies, but he 
failed to endow them with the income needed. The famous 
Lady Margaret, two generations later, was the first to endow 
a University Chair. But without such permanent endowments 
University teaching was bound to fail. Tutors and lecturers 
on College foundations stepped more and more into the places 
of the old Masters of the Schools. College funds became respon- 
sible for teaching which the poverty of the University was unable 
to provide. The necessary lectures of the Regents were more and 
more excused or avoided as time went on. In the sixteenth 
century they became little better than a form. The single 
“ Ordinarius,” who survived for generations to give formal 
lectures in each of the Arts and Philosophies, ceased to command 
or to expect an audience, and gave ‘‘ Wall Lectures” to the 
empty walls. 
From very early days, however, the Regents appear to have 
been by no means indisposed to dispense themselves from the 
obligation to lecture. Graces and dispensations of all kinds 
played a large part in University life. The regulations were 
so cumbrous that it became a common practice to ask for leave 
to omit some of them. Graces for that purpose became a matter 
of course, and almost an inseparable part of a degree. When 
a candidate was ready to graduate and thought that he had 
studied enough for the purpose, he presented his supplicat, 
1 Mr. Anstey, followed by Sir H.C. M. Lyte (218-19), derives the familiar 
College “‘ Collections ” from the fees, collecta, paid by pupils, which the 
Masters were bound to collect (Mun. Acad. xcvi, 428, etc.). 
2 But for special teaching more could be charged (Ib. 439-40). At 
Bologna, it seems, the fees for Grammar were lower than the fees for 
Logic and higher than the fees for Medicine (Rashdall, I, 240).  
-P-A-G-E-231
200 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
stating the terms he had kept, the lectures and exercises which 
he had attended, and asking for the other formalities to be 
dispensed with.1 The granting of Graces became a regular 
source of income. There were petitions of many kinds, petitions 
for leave to omit a certain number of lectures, petitions, less 
common perhaps, to vary the books prescribed, petitions to 
count a term kept at Cambridge or terms spent out of Oxford 
owing to the plague, petitions backed by influential persons, 
which at times threatened to degenerate into abuses, to secure 
University honours for individuals who were far from having 
satisfied the ordinary rules. And the conditions on which 
Graces were granted varied as widely. Sometimes they were 
granted simpliciter, without conditions, Sometimes an additional 
sermon or disputation or additional lectures were required in 
return. Sometimes presents for the Regents were exacted ; 
robes, knives, dinners were not despised. Sometimes a special 
contribution, like the payment of a noble, was imposed. And 
sometimes, when hard pressed for money for a great, expensive 
purpose such as the building of the Divinity School, the University 
resorted to what was practically the sale of Graces, perhaps more 
freely than it liked.? 
This important power of dispensing with rules, of granting 
dispensations from Statutes, belonged to the Masters, who not 
infrequently exercised it in their own behalf. There is evidence 
that it was easily abused. But it is not so easy to say to which 
Congregation the power originally or properly belonged.® It 
is clear that the Lesser Congregation of Regents possessed it, 
1E.g. in January 1456 John Toly, a Benedictine monk, supplicates 
that two years in the Faculty of Arts and six years in Canon Law with 
four long and short vacations may suffice that he be admitted ad lecturam 
extvaovdinariam of any book of the Decretals. This Grace, it may be 
added, which was conceded, was promulgated by one of the Proctors 
(Reg. Aa, 93°). 2In the latter part of the fifteenth century they brought in to the 
University on the average some £16 or £17 a year (Med. Arch. II, 273). 
8 Mun. Acad. (572-3). See also Ib. (730-5). 
4 Ib. (95 and 331-2). 
5 Dean Rashdall thinks (II, 447, n.) that the constitutional power of 
dispensation lay with the Regents, except when specially reserved by 
Statute to the Great Congregation. But I am not sure that this view 
covers all the facts. The University was allowed, in the words of the 
Preface to Reg. A. (Mun. Acad. 369) “‘ coetu Magistrorum regentium et 
non-regentium adjurato [recte adunato], statuta corrigere, eis addere 
seu detrahere . . . quatenus major pars Universitatis et sanior, deliber- 
atione previa, duxerit ordinandum: solent tamen Regentes sine Non- 
regentibus, propter fatigationes et vexationes frequentes in vocatione 
Non-regentium evitandas, gratiose cum personis aliquibus, certis ex causis, 
contra statuta aliquoties dispensare”; but they must be properly 
summoned, and all present must consent, 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  THE MEDIAVAL UNIVERSITY AT WORK 201 
and from their use of it there has descended their immemorial 
right to confer degrees. But it is equally clear that the Great 
Congregation of Regents and Non-Regents exercised it also. 
And there can be no doubt that the Congregation of Artists 
claimed the right to discuss the grant of Graces, as well as other 
matters, before they went on to the Great Congregation.1_ But 
this claim was not uncontested,? and by the middle of the 
fifteenth century it may have been generally ignored. The 
Register of that period shows us the Great Congregation granting 
Graces so freely, in one year at any rate, that their prerogative 
in the matter must have been beyond dispute. Possibly in 
this, as in other cases, the lines were not always strictly drawn, 
and the old regulations proved more flexible in practice than 
their wording would suggest. Graces were undoubtedly a 
valuable device. -They provided for all sorts of special cases. 
They avoided possible hardships. They rendered elastic a 
system where elasticity was greatly required. And when the 
ancient rules went out of fashion, they were of considerable use 
in bridging over the change to newer ways. 
The winning of a Master’s degree in the Middle Ages, still 
more the winning of the Doctorate in Medicine, Theology or 
Law, required, as these time-honoured regulations show us, a 
substantial period of work. The ways of learning were difficult 
and costly. The standards insisted on in principle at any rate 
were high. Many of the young men who passed through Oxford, 
who crowded its churches, sang in its taverns, fought in its by- 
ways, disputed in its Schools, probably found these demands 
beyond them and failed to carry the process through. The 
splendid ardour of the age of Abélard, the exaltation of the age 
which discovered Aristotle afresh, yielded in time to duller 
1 Mun. Acad. (117, 331-2, 429 and 491). 
2 Ib. (188-9). 
3On March 17, 1450, in days when its old importance had departed, 
the Black Congregation resolved to ask the Great Congregation to decree, 
for this time only, that the Graces on the roll (with two exceptions) might 
be sought in the Black (Parva) Congregation, any Statute notwithstanding ; 
and this proposal the Great Congregation accepted next day (Reg. Aa, 
41), It is regrettable that our information on these points depends so 
largely on one fifteenth-century Register. In 1503 a decree forbade the 
Congregation of Regents to grant dispensations in cases reserved by 
Statute to the Great Congregation. (See Reg. B, 102, and E, 64>.) 
The entries in Registrum Aa in February 1456 record a number 
of Graces granted by the Lesser Congregation of Regents, one or two and 
three or four at a time. But these are accompanied by much more 
numerous grants of Graces made by the Great Congregation, six, nine, 
thirteen, twenty-four, in a single day. In that month at any rate the 
great majority of Graces must have been granted by the larger body. 
(See Reg. Aa 93°, 94%, 95, 96 and 97%.)

generations and more commonplace aims, to the search for 
experience, adventure or good fellowship, to the ordinary needs 
of education, to the calls of a professional career. The soul of 
the old system languished, and men became impatient of its 
verbal casuistry, its stereotyped routine. But the life of medieval 
Oxford at its best was a life which scholars could delight in. 
The atmosphere was one of intellectual effort, widely diffused if 
not always clearly understood. The comradeship of master and 
pupil, the contact of mind with mind, bore fruit. And the leaders 
of thought, however few their disciples, never forgot the grandeur 
of their task, to make all knowledge the training ground of reason 
and reason the interpreter of faith, and by their help to solve 
the overshadowing problems of the destiny of man and the 
purposes of God.

CHAPTER VI 
THE SCHOOLMEN OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY— 
DUNS SCOTUS, OCKHAM, WYCLIFFE 
HATEVER Oxford taught men in the Middle Ages 
there is no doubt that she taught them to dispute. 
Philosophy was a lofty and laborious science, in which 
only a minority of students could hope to travel far. But all 
who wished to enter on that field of study had to learn the use 
of logic first.1 The syllogistic method was universal. To excel 
in logical discussion was the test of success. Oxford logicians 
and philosophers may have produced an infinity of sophisms. 
But they produced also a number of fine and subtle minds. And 
in none were their characteristics more conspicuous than in the 
great Schoolman who made Franciscan influence for a time 
supreme, and whose name, by the strange ironies of chance and 
education, has become a synonym for stupidity to-day. Even 
Thomas Cromwell’s Commissioners, who ‘‘ set Dunce in Bocardo,” 
could not destroy his reputation, though they scattered his 
writings to the winds. His intricate and imaginative genius, 
with the keen and vigorous reactions it provoked, left its stamp 
deeply on the later Schoolmen and helped for generations to 
mould European thought. 
Thomas Aquinas, as even his critics admitted, had made a 
noble effort to settle once for all the foundations of philosophy, 
to render the orthodox thinker contented and secure. But into 
his place as the chief leader of the Schools there stepped a 
new philosopher, whose disturbing ingenuity opened the flood- 
gates of speculation afresh. Of the life of John Duns Scotus we 
know curiously little. He was a Franciscan Friar, born some- 
where in these islands, earlier probably than 1274, the year 
of St. Thomas’ death. He lectured at Oxford, it seems, about 
the beginning of the fourteenth century. He lectured also at 
Paris. He wrote voluminously. He died at Cologne.? But 
beyond these facts we know nothing certainly about him. The 
1 The distinction between logica utens, which was a method not a 
science, and Jogica docens, of which the proper object was the syllogism, 
and which was a science in so far as it dealt with the laws of thought, 
was emphasised by Duns Scotus but is found in Albert the Great.

monument erected to his memory in 1513 in the Minorite Church 
at Cologne summarised all, perhaps more than all, that we can 
safely say. 
“Scotia me genuit, 
Anglia me suscepit, 
Gallia me docuit, 
Colonia me tenet.” 
Two great authorities! have declared that no materials now 
exist at Oxford likely to throw more light on his career. A 
manuscript at Merton College, written in 1455, makes him a 
native of Northumberland and a Fellow of Merton; the former 
statement may be worth consideration, but the latter may be 
dismissed. A note in the catalogue of the Library at Assisi, 
written in 1381, makes him an Irishman. A strong plea has 
been put forward for his Scottish birth.2 A reasonable conjecture 
identifies him with a “‘ Johannes Douns,” who in the year 1300 
failed to secure the Bishop’s license to hear confessions in Oxford. 
If this identification be correct, Duns must have been thirty by 
that time and could not have been born as late as 1274. But he 
apparently remained in Oxford, and was soon afterwards lecturing 
on the Sentences as a Bachelor of Divinity there. His great 
commentary on the Sentences, known later as the Scriptum or 
Opus Oxoniense, soon won a high place in the Schools. Like 
other Schoolmen Duns took the whole world of knowledge for 
1 Bishop Stubbs and Mr. Coxe of the Bodleian (Mullinger, I, 173, n.). 
But younger Oxford scholars may have more to say ; and to one of them, 
Mr. C. R. S. Harris, who is now working on Duns Scotus, I owe many 
valuable suggestions. The facts as to Duns’ life will be found in Mr. 
Little’s Grey Friavs (219-22), in his edition of Father Fitzmaurice’s 
Materials for the History of the Franciscan Province of Iveland (87-8), 
in De Martigné’s La Scolastique et les traditions Franciscaines (256-98), 
and in D.N.B. Wadding’s great edition of his works (1639) includes 
some of which the authorship is doubtful: the De Rerum Principio in 
vol. III is important for Duns’ metaphysical views, and the great col- 
lection of Questiones on the Sentences in vols. V to X, which constitute 
the Opus Oxoniense, is important for his theology, and indeed for all his 
precepts. Among modern writers, besides the references in Mr. Mullin- 
ger’s and Dean Rashdall’s volumes, and Dr. Harnack’s discussion of 
Duns’ contributions to dogma in vol. VI of his History of Dogma (tr.),

his province. His speculations on astronomy—the profound 
influence of the stars on human life was of course a common- 
place with the thinkers of his age—did not close, if they did not 
open, the way to modern science. His views on civil society, 
on property and contract, showed his independence. His plea 
for poverty as almost essential to holiness, his exaltation of the 
poverty-loving monks above the secular prelates of the Church, 
brought down perhaps rebukes upon his head.1’ As a moralist 
he was sometimes startling. As a grammarian he had both 
originality and breadth. As a mathematician he is said to have 
been remarkable. As a logician he was supreme. In December 
1304 he was called to Paris, in a letter which bore witness to his 
“praiseworthy life, his excellent knowledge and his most subtle 
mind.” In Paris he taught perhaps for three or four years. He 
may then have lectured for a short time in the Franciscan Schools 
at Cologne. There is little reason to reject the tradition that he 
died early. There is still less reason to accept the story which 
declares that he was buried alive in a trance. But he found 
time to fill twelve folio volumes with dialectics which fascinated 
if they bewildered his age. And posterity for long bore witness, 
as ungrudgingly as his own generation, to the depth, the richness, 
the dexterity of his extraordinary mind. 
Able critics have differed widely in their interpretations of 
Duns Scotus’ philosophy. Some have recognized him rightly 
as above all else a metaphysician. Others have maintained 
with less plausibility that the worship of logic was the key to his 
career. The exact value to be assigned to logic was a favourite 
subject of discussion in the Schools. Two famous teachers of 
the thirteenth century, William Shirwood and Petrus Hispanus 
—the latter a Portugese divine trained in Paris, afterwards con- 
spicuous as Pope John XXI—had introduced to Latin scholars 
a new method of treating logic, and Pope John’s Summule 
Logicales were for long a leading text-book in the West.* But 
1 The treatise De Perfectione Statuum, if genuine, may well have caused 
resentment, and may well, as Dr. Landry points out (Duns Scot, 245-50), 
have been made a reason for removing the writer summarily in 1308 
from Paris to Cologne. 
2M. Hauréau and Dean Milman (Latin Christianity, 1864, ix, 141) 
represent the two schools. It is not easy to be certain first what Duns 
actually wrote, secondly how far he varied his opinions, and thirdly how 
far his commentators have interpreted him aright. 
3 Mr. Mullinger (I, 175-9), following Prantl (Geschich. der Logik, I, 
264), derives the work of Shirwood and of Petrus Hispanus from the 
manual on logic written by Psellus, an eleventh-century Professor at 
Constantinople. But it is quite as likely that the Synopsis of Psellus, 
so-called, was a later translation into Greek of the Summule of Petrus 
Hispanus, which even in the fifteenth century were still read in St. Andrews 
and Glasgow. See M. Thurot’s articles (Revue Aychéologique, 1864, X,
-P-A-G-E-237
206 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
with the re-discovery of Aristotle and the re-birth of philosophy 
logic ceased to occupy so large aspace. The leaders of the Schools 
depended on it still as an instrument invaluable for arriving at 
knowledge. But they refused to rank it with physics or meta- 
physics, as a science dealing with veritable entities like the laws 
of Nature or the existence of God. Albert the Great laid it down 
that logic was not concerned with being but only with “‘ second 
intentions.”’1 Second intentions were conceptions of the human 
intellect which had no real existence in the Divine mind or in 
the external world. And if Duns Scotus argued that these 
concepts of the intellect had an objective reality, and that the 
logic concerned with them was a science of reasoning though not 
a real science,® he differed little from Albert or Aquinas there. 
He cannot fairly be charged with teaching men to regard logic 
as an end rather than a means, or to accept @ priori reasoning, 
verbal subtleties and intellectual distinctions as more important 
than the scientific observation by which alone true knowledge 
can be advanced. 
Scotus realised as clearly as any of the Schoolmen that there 
were fields which logic could not cover, beliefs which it was idle 
to ask it to explain. Old teachers had subordinated philosophy 
to theology. Aquinas and his disciples had reconciled the two. 
But with Duns Scotus and William of Ockham they to some extent 
parted company again. Aquinas had been forced to reserve 
certain of the Christian mysteries, doctrines like the Creation, 
the Trinity, the Incarnation, as problems of faith which reason 
could not adequately solve. Duns, it seems, went further in 
relegating doctrines of theology to the sphere of faith. Hecould 
not find a satisfactory proof of the omnipotence of God or of the 
immortality of the soul. In one treatise indeed he produced 
267-81, and Revue Critique d’Histoive, etc., 1867, I, 199-202, and II, 
4-11), Ueberweg (Hist. of Philosophy, tr., I, 404, n.), Dr. Poole’s article 
on Ockham, D.N.B., and Rashdall (II, 296, n.). As regards Shirwood I 
cannot agree with Mr. Mullinger (I, 177) that the reference to “ old 
Sherewood’s Vicetie ’’ in Ben Jonson’s song written for The King’s Enter- 
tainment at Welbeck (Fol. of 1640, p. 278)—it is not a part of the Under- 
woods—has anything to do with the thirteenth-century Schoolman. The 
piece has several topical references to Sherwood Forest. 
2“ Scientiz logicze non considerant ens et partem entis aliquem, sed 
intentiones secundas ” (Prantl, III, 91, n.). As M. Hauréau explains it 
(I, ii, 176), the intellect, directing itself towards external objects, dis- 
cerns, for example, the individual Socrates; that notion is the intentio 
prima. It then goes on to recognise Socrates as an animal; that notion 
is the intentio secunda.

argument after argument for the existence of a single, final 
Cause.1_ He maintained the possibility of securing by natural 
reason some knowledge of God.* And he held with St. Thomas 
that some of God’s attributes could be explained by reason while 
others could be deduced from revelation alone. But for Scotus, 
it seems, even more than for Aquinas, there were certain all- 
important dogmas of religion which it had to be frankly recog- 
nised that neither logic nor philosophy could prove.* He found 
their source and explanation only in the will of God, on which 
everything depended, the world’s existence and the moral law. 
Deeply and warmly religious, he raised the claims of authority 
even higher than before. But at the same time, if all the works 
attributed to him are genuine, some of his arguments might have 
been used to sweep the rational basis of belief away.4 For 
Aquinas the Divine Will, like the human will, was subject to 
a rational determination. God commanded what was good 
because it was good. Arabian commentators even denied the 
freedom of God. For Duns the Divine Will was subject to far 
less limitation. Good was good because God willed it so. He 
emphasised and insisted on the Free Will of God. That was 
with him a cardinal doctrine, though it might occasionally lead 
to dangerous admissions and results. He insisted also on the 
freedom of man. He exalted the will as compared with the 
intellect, love as compared with knowledge. He would have 
softened the rigour of the Augustinian teaching by reviving 
in-all its fullness the earlier doctrine of Free Will. But in 
the main he left theology dependent on authority and faith. 
Clearer than human argument and observation there shone 
1 De Rerum Principio (Wadding, III). 
2See Pluzanski (Chap. VI). 
* It is very difficult to be sure of Duns’ views on the relations between 
theology and philosophy. See Minges (Das Verhdltniss zwischen Glauben 
und Wissen). 
«Mr. Harris has pointed out to me that in the De Rerum Principio, 
the De Primo Principio and the Commentaries on the Sentences Duns’ 
position is not in principle different from that of St. Thomas, and that it 
is only in the Theoremata, a fragment incomplete and ill-arranged, that 
a more sceptical position is taken up. Mr. Harris doubts if this is Duns’ 
work. So does P, Déodat Marie de Basly in an article on the Theoremata in 
Archivum Franciscanum Historicum (tom. XI, 1918, pp. 3-31). On the 
other hand a very recent commentator, Dr. Landry, does not accept this 
view. 
5 But that, Minges points out, did not prevent good things from 
having also an inherent goodness in them, See on the problem of the 
arbitrariness of the Free Will of God, on which Duns has probably been 
often misixterpreted, Minges’ treatise Dey Gottesbegriff des Duns Scotus 
and his article in the Philosophisches Jahybuch for 1906 (Bedeutung von

within the soul a light divine, illuminating man’s experience, 
revealing in the darkness the difficult approach to truth. 
But in philosophy Duns Scotus took a bolder tone. Realist 
as he was, often as he may seem to yield to the Realist tempta- 
tion to “ multiply entities without necessity,” to fill with abstrac- 
tions the whole world of thought, his re-statement of the problems 
set by the Schoolmen was both original and profound. On the 
great problem of the Universals orthodox Scholasticism was now 
to a large extent agreed.? The old question ‘‘ What is the 
Universal? ’’ had been succeeded by the question ‘‘ In what 
does Individuality consist ?’’ The problem how the Universal 
existed in the individual had reappeared as the problem of in- 
dividuation, and Aquinas, by maintaining that the principle of 
individuation lay in matter, had startled and confused his age. 
Duns Scotus joined issue on that point with the Dominican 
teaching, and tried to re-state the whole problem in regard to 
Universals afresh. He and his disciples inevitably challenged 
some of St. Thomas’ conclusions, his theories in regard to angels, 
his doctrine of the Unity of Form. But Duns was less concerned 
to deny specifically the doctrines of Aquinas than to place his 
own interpretation on the old problems, to find fresh meanings 
of infinite variety for formulas which had racked so many philo- 
sophic minds. He delighted in ingenious speculation. His 
method is controversial and involved. His chief work was done 
in commenting on others, in explaining, answering, refining 
points which they had raised. His comments made at different 
times may not be always perfectly consistent. He did not live 
long enough, it may be, to elaborate a.complete or final state- 
ment of his views. But as arguments they are stimulating and 
suggestive in a high degree. The origin of knowledge and ideas, 
the existence, the will and the attributes of God, the nature of 
matter, the problem of being, the source of the intellect and of 
the soul of man—these were the vast and lofty questions which 
Duns Scotus once more called the Schoolmen to debate. 
Scotus was neither a sceptic nor a mystic, though he may 
have had something of the nature of both... Nor in many of his 
doctrines did he travel far from the path trodden by the orthodox 
thinkers of his day. Like them he took the experience of the 
senses as the basis of our knowledge. Like them, trying to give 
Aristotle “‘a Catholic interpretation,” he sought the principle 
1 Yet the Nominalists borrowed from Duns some of their weapons, 
and the distinction between Realism and Nominalism is not in his case 
always clear. M. Hauréau (LI, ii, 216-24) perhaps presses the charge of 
Realism too far.

of life outside the body, and agreed that through the soul the 
body lives and feels and thinks, But he differed from St. Thomas 
as to the way in which the soul became united with the body, 
and as to the nature of the body when once united with the soul. 
St. Thomas, in his determined opposition to materialism, held 
that the “ corporeity ” of the body, even that which made it a 
body, was due to the soul. And he held that there was only one 
soul in man, one substantial form, the anima rationalis, which 
included all the vital functions. But was St. Thomas right in 
maintaining that matter had no actual entity and could not 
exist without form? Did not his acceptance of matter as the 
principle of individuation imply that after death there would 
be no matter by which human minds could be distinguished from 
each other and involve a heresy, the unity of all human minds ? 
Was not the doctrine of the Unity of Form even more dangerous 
theologically ? For if the soul were the form of the body, it 
disappeared with it, and Christ’s body in the tomb could not have 
been substantially the same as Christ’s living body. Duns could 
not accept these conclusions. He held, perhaps more naturally; 
that corporeity belonged to the body. The body might preserve 
its form even when the soul passed from it. Christ kept His form 
of corporeity in the tomb. Absolute unity of form could not 
be insisted on. More than one form must enter into the making 
of man. 
In the days when Duns Scotus was a student, Aquinas had 
by no means won universal recognition, and in arguing against 
some of his innovations Duns was upholding the older traditions 
of the Schools. Duns drew from St. Augustine two of his 
favourite doctrines, the superiority of the will to the intelligence 
and the Plurality of Forms.?. But in each case he took a view 
of his own. An important letter exists, written by Archbisho 
Kilwardby, probably about 1278, to an Archbishop of Corinth 
who had fallen a victim to the temptations of Aquinas.? The 
English Primate took his stand on St. Augustine. He main- 
tained the substantial reality of the rationes seminales sive 
originales verum—the germs deposited by God in matter, to 
1The esse corporeum, distinct from the esse vivendum (Pluzanski, 
114-15). 
2 Prof. de Wulf, in his edition of Le Traité ‘‘ De Unitate Forme”’ de 
Gilles de Lessines (Les Philosophes Belges, I, 22 and 30-2), argues that 
the thesis of the plurality of forms was not Augustinian by temperament, 
but the product of a “‘ péripatétisme faussé,” and largely due to Arabic 
and Jewish interpretations of Aristotle. 
* This letter, with the six main points selected for argument, is given 
by F. Ehrle in his article on Augustinianism and Aristotelianism in Archiv 
fiir Literatur-und-Kirchen-Geschichte des Mittelalters (V, 603-35), and is dis- 
cussed by De Wulf in Chap. VI of his introduction to G. de Lessines’ treatise,

appear one day as substantial forms 1—which played so large a 
part in the teaching of that great Father of the Church.? He 
insisted on the multiplicity of forms in nature, on the need of 
distinguishing the vegetative, the sensitive and the intellectual 
souls in man. The many operations of the human body, the 
diversity of parts affected—the feet and hands and eyes of a 
living man—required a diversity of integrating forms. So only 
could the problem of human generation and the deeper problems 
of the faith be understood. Duns refined upon this earlier theory. 
He took a line between Kilwardby and Aquinas. There was one 
primary form actuating matter and producing the body. There 
was another form giving life. Duns held that, besides the soul, 
the body had its forma corporeitatis, and that the organs of the 
body had their own substantial forms.. But he held also that 
the vegetative, sensitive and intellectual souls were not three 
forms but one. He would not allow plurality of forms within 
the spiritual principle.. He would not multiply entities without 
necessity there. He called in the famous principle of parsimony, 
Frustra fit per plura quod per pauciora aque bene fieri potest. 
The doctrine of form and matter was bound up inextricably with 
the ideas of act and power. The determining act, it was argued 
on the one side, must be a single form and simple. The con- 
stituting principle of things in nature, that which in communi- 
cating itself to matter’ gave it its substantial determination, 
could not be composed of several forms. The problem was to 
reconcile the unity of the soul with the multiplicity of its opera- 
tions. To which on the other side it was ‘answered that the 
multiplicity of a being’s perfections required a multiplicity of 
substantial forms, which all applied their determining act to 
matter. The problem was to assign the share of each in con- 
stituting the concrete thing.® To the mind of Duns Scotus, 
who could conceive of matter as created before any form deter- 
mined its existence, any number of acts might interpose between 
1 Ehrle (Ib. 633) describes them as “ wirkliche in der ‘ materia prima’ 
schlummernde Krafte, welche, durch die Einwirkung des eine neue Wesens- 
form hervorbringenden Princips erweckt, zu jener Hervorbringung mit- 
wirken.”’ See also Landry (Duns Scot, ch, III).

the primary matter not yet in existence and the final union of 
form and matter in the concrete thing. 
Idealist as he was, Duns insisted on the unity of matter and 
on its presence in all things created.!_ St. Thomas had perplexed 
the orthodox by suggesting that angels had no matter in them, 
and that in matter the principle of individuation lay. Duns 
declared that matter must enter into angels as into other things, 
and thus restored the individuality of the angel host.2 He 
likened the world to a beautiful tree. Its roots were prime 
matter. Its leaves were passing accidents. Its branches were 
substances subject to corruption. Its flower was the reasoning 
soul, its fruit the angelical nature. And the hand of God had 
formed it from the first. He recognised the existence of matter 
and form in all beings susceptible of change, of matter which is 
the subject of the change, and of form which is its result. But 
he distinguished, in his earlier works at least, matter primarily 
prime, which had no form, only essence without existence, from 
matter secondarily prime, which had received the form of the 
corruptible and the incorruptible, and from matter prime in 
the third degree, which was distributed among all species. He 
traced to form the differences which determined matter second- 
arily and thirdly prime alike. It was in the ultimate form which 
actualised the ultimate division of matter, which conferred on 
the substance individual existence, that the principle of individu- 
ation must be found, in other words, in a special principle which 
made it this being rather than that. And for this individu- 
ating form Duns invented the strange term heccitas or thisness, 
where Aquinas had been contented to dwell on the quidditas 
or whainess constituting man. ‘‘ Over speculations like these,” 
cried’ Erasmus passionately, “theologians professing to teach 
Christianity have been squandering their lives.” As one strains 
after the meaning of the Schoolmen, one ceases to wonder at the 
thirteenth-century story of the upright and unhappy clerk, who 
was sometimes led by his studies to doubt whether he had a soul 
at all, whether there were a God to seek for, and whether the 
world were other than a dream.® 
1See Wadding (III, 52 sq.). 
2 St. Thomas had to rely on the theory that every angel was a separate 
species, while men were individuals of one species. 
8 De Rerum Principio (VIII, 4, 30; Wadding, III, 53). The roots 
divided into corporeal and spiritual branches. 
*As Dr. Landry puts it, human substance can be given to many 
individuals, The same substance augmented by heccitas can only belong 
to one (Duns Scot, tor). The constituting principle of individuality, 
Pluzanski comments (229 and note) is that which completes the reality 
of the being, ultima realitas entis—realitas not res.

  aiz A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
It was not difficult to mock—Erasmus mocked delightfully 
—at notions, formalities, quiddities like these, ‘‘ things which 
no eyes ever saw, unless they were eyes which could see in the 
dark what had no existence.’ What gave to such arguments 
their practical importance was their bearing on theology and 
the problems of the faith. If the Doctors of the Church inquired 
what happened to the elements in the Eucharist when the miracle 
of Transubstantiation was performed, they were driven for ex- 
planation to the metaphysics of the Schools. When St. Thomas 
argued for the Unity of Form, he had to apply his doctrine 
to the presence of Christ in the Sacrament, and to explain how 
that mystery was intelligible if the form of Christ had passed 
at death. The questions how the great miracle was to be in- 
terpreted, what happened to the substances and accidents when 
the ceremony took place, in what sense Christ in the first memor- 
able Supper partook of Himself, how the Eucharist could have 
been celebrated while Christ’s body remained in the grave—a 
point which Aquinas had not made intelligible, but which Duns 
Scotus urged with his irrepressible imagination1—these were 
the problems which assailed the Schoolmen, and which at times 
they handled with astonishing intrepidity and resource. No 
doubt, they had to pay their tribute, not only to august tradi- 
tions, but to the emotional cravings of their age. Critics have 
pointed out how large a part is played in religious history by 
popular superstition, based in the first place on the senses, 
modified—not always rendered clear—by philosophic teaching, 
and accepted by ecclesiastical authority in the end. But the 
demands of faith and the need for explanation in their turn 
stimulated the advance of thought.2 The Schoolmen were 
scientists as well as theologians. Confined and mysterious as 
were the ways in which they wandered, they were yet the ways 
of learning and inquiry, and the men who followed them were 
recognised as the intellectual leaders of their age. 
It was no proof of intellectual weakness if medieval Oxford 
found Duns Scotus hard to understand. And it was not un- 
natural that posterity, reviewing with little sympathy the labours 
of the Schoolmen, fixed on his metaphysical gymnastics as the 
supreme type of over-refinement in debate. ‘‘ The logician spins 
cobwebs out of his own inside,” sang the students who studied 
his writings, and even more readily the students who did not. 
1On Duns’ doctrine of the Sacraments see Harnack’s summary (tr. 
VI, 226-7, n.). 
2“ From the doctrine of God there grew up the doctrines of thought 
and of will ; from the doctrine of the Trinity, the doctrine of the Kosmos ; 
from the doctrine of the Lord’s Supper, the doctrine of space ” (Ib. VI, 
238; see also 313, n.).
-P-A-G-E-244
  THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY SCHOOLMEN 213 
“Logicus aranee potest comparari, 
Que subtiles didicit telas operari, 
Que suis visceribus volunt consummari.” 
Rabelais mocked at the “ Barbouillamenta Scoti.” Humanists 
and Protestants poured ridicule upon his faults. Diderot coined 
a word to rebuke his sophistications. Descartes declared that 
the logic of the Schoolmen more often corrupted than added to 
sense. No doubt, the Subtle Doctor sometimes allowed his love 
of argument to carry him too far. No doubt, the study he ex- 
celled in preferred defining words to ascertaining facts. ‘“ What 
is the best thing and the worst among men? ”’ asks the clerk 
in the curious old Oxford Catechism,! among numerous other 
questions dealing largely with the family history of Adam and 
of Noah. And the Master’s answer ‘‘ Word is best and worst ”’ 
perhaps throws some light on the method of the Schools. How 
many of Duns’ hearers, one wonders, followed his flights com- 
pletely? How many found a stimulus, how many found 
bewilderment, in contact with that astonishing debater? Yet 
behind the ceaseless syllogisms, the singular and intricate dis- 
tinctions, the imagination of the controversial thinker running 
wild, one hears a voice that has thoughts to utter, one sees a 
strong, clear intellect at work. The methods may be devious 
or misleading. But the vision splendid is in view. And Duns 
after all was occupied with subjects which were the chosen study 
of some of the best minds of his day. If the Realist sought in 
Universals the foundations of individual life, if the Nominalist 
tried to weave into his philosophy such observation of natural 
phenomena as his opportunities allowed, if teachers led their 
pupils to examine the relation of form to matter and of concepts 
to realities, the meaning of substance, accidents, species and the 
like, it was from no mere love of verbal quibbling or of arguing 
for arguing’s sake. It was because they thought that these 
difficult speculations were steps upon the path of knowledge, 
real aids to the solution of the mysteries of life. Beyond the 
web of Scholastic disputation they saw the quest of the Holy 
Grail. And the problems which they struggled to interpret are 
not dead. To every boy who grows to manhood in the city 
where Duns Scotus taught, there comes sooner or later, if he has 
a mind that questions, the longing to know more of these per- 
plexities, the imperious impulse to unravel them if he may. 
Oxford’s inheritance from the Middle Ages is the attempt to 
think about high things like these. And so long as youth lasts 
and inquires and wonders, the voice which the Schoolmen vainly

tried to answer will call, and call not vainly, to the hearts and 
understandings of men. 
Other names and other arguments not less perplexing play 
their part in the philosophy of the great Franciscan School. 
Duns, no doubt, wandered far from the paths which other Grey 
Friars had trodden, from the devout mysticism of Bonaventura 
and the practical common-sense of Bacon. But both inside 
and outside his Order his views found friends. Henry of Ghent, 
a fellow-student of Aquinas at Cologne, and one of the earliest 
and most brilliant theologians of the Sorbonne, anticipated 
some of Duns’ opinions.t Three Minorites, claimed as Oxford 
students,? William of Ware, William de la Mare and Richard 
Middleton, have been reckoned among his masters. William 
de la Mare was one of the boldest critics of St. Thomas’ doctrine 
of Unity of Form, and William of Ware’s commentary upon the 
Sentences may be read in the Merton Library to-day. When 
the Subtle Doctor’s brief career was over, his victorious syllo- 
gisms still held their empire in debate. At Oxford teachers like 
John Dumbleton and John Baconthorp the Carmelite sustained” 
them. Walter Burley, the tireless commentator upon Aristotle, 
taught upon lines which the Realists had traced.? And though 
Richard of Bury, the book-loving Bishop of Durham, added 
nothing, for all his interest and celebrity, tothe philosophy of 
his day, Thomas Bradwardine, one of his Chaplains, lent the 
authority of a celebrated treatise to support the Realist tradition 
and the accepted logic of the Schools. Bradwardine, a great 
figure in the Church, a great studerit of philosophy, and an Arch- 
bishop of Canterbury whom the Black Death struck down, 
returned to the ideas of Augustine, and foreshadowed some of 
Calvin’s views. His bold appeal to Predestinarian dogmas gave 
a lead which Wycliffe followed, struck a deep note in the theology 
of his time. And Chaucer himself has borne witness to the part 
which the intellectual discussion of such problems played in the 
England which he. knew.

of Aquinas, and owed a good deal, it seems, to Bonaventura and to Bacon. 
Richard Middleton is said to have written on the Immaculate Conception, 
a doctrine whose triumph has been associated also with Duns. (See Little, 
Grey Friars, 213-5, Hauréau, II, ii, Chap. XX, and Rashdall, II, 530 and 
539-) * Walter Burley of Merton cannot be claimed as a Friar.

That in scole is greet altercacioun 
In this mateere, and greet disputisoun 
And hath been of an hundred thousand men.” ? 
Meanwhile within the ranks of his own Order a revolt against 
the methods of Duns Scotus had begun, Whether or not William 
of Ockham took his name from the ancient Surrey village whose 
peace not even the cataract of modern traffic has destroyed, 
there is no doubt that he was studying among the Grey Friars 
of Oxford in the days when the doctrines of the Subtle Doctor 
filled the Schools. Recent criticism has dealt severely with the 
traditions gathered round the early life of Ockham, and most of 
the facts alleged about it have been successfully impugned. He 
was never a member of Merton College. He was never, it seems, 
a leader or even a student in the Schools of Paris. He was born 
too late to be a pupil of Duns Scotus. He probably never 
qualified for the title of Doctor which posterity unanimously 
conferred.2. But he was undoubtedly a son of Oxford. It was 
at Oxford that he studied and lectured and won his Bachelor’s 
degree. And it was from Oxford that his fame as a theologian 
and philosopher spread to Paris and occupied the world. The 
followers of Aquinas found their master’s doctrines, on the 
principle of individuation, on species, on divine ideas, subjected 
to a criticism keener than any they had met with yet. The 
followers of Duns Scotus found, under the Franciscan banner, 
an antagonist strong enough in intellect and courage to sweep 
the needless abstractions of their School away. 
It was as a critic chiefly that William of Ockham excelled, 
and his criticism proved surprisingly destructive to many of the 
doctrines which the older Schoolmen had maintained. He 
abandoned, more definitely and boldly than Duns Scotus, the 
attempt to identify reason with religion. He declared that the 
dogmas of theology lay, and must ever lie, beyond the region of 
proof. Logic had its own sphere and processes and limitations. 
Philosophy and psychology had clear and intelligible aims. But 
1See The College Chaucey (ed. MacCracken, 200); the passage is 
quoted by Mullinger (I, 198-9). Bradwardine’s famous treatise, De 
Causa Dei, was of great importance in fourteenth-century theology (see 
Harnack, VI, 169-70). Dr. Rashdall comments (II, 540)—‘‘ However 
appalling some of the Augustinian dogmas may sound to modern ears, 
it must be admitted that a return to Augustine was a step towards a 
return to spiritual Christianity.’”’ I have thought it better in this brief 
outline of the methods and ideas of two or three leading Schoolmen to 
avoid entering on questions like the relative influence of Augustinian- 
ism and Aristotelianism and many other philosophical questions, which 
students of the subject will find adequately treated elsewhere. 
2 These facts seem to be established by the careful study of Ockham’s 
early life given by P. J. Hofer (Avchivum Franciscanum Historicum, V1, 
209-33). He places Ockham’s birth little before 1300.
-P-A-G-E-247
  216 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
revealed religion, the vision of things divine, lay quite apart. 
The existence and the unity of God were not provable by 
argument ; they were articles of faith. Transubstantiation, if 
impossible to grasp by human reason, was on that account all 
the more a proof of the omnipotence of God.!_ In the region of 
theology William of Ockham bowed as readily as any loyal 
Catholic to the formulas, the authority, even the superstitions 
of the Church. There he realised, as Duns did, the inadequacy 
of reason. He was content to rest on intuition. Like Duns he 
understood the mystic’s point of view. But in the region of 
philosophy he turned his back on dogma; and plunged into 
speculation as frankly as any*sceptic could desire.2 What he 
could not explain he left to theology. For the rest he appealed 
to common-sense. The subtleties which the Realists relied on 
to reconcile the two became irrelevant. Experience, observation, 
the methods of induction; the modern spirit prevailed. Saved 
from all dangerous conflict with authority, and acclaimed after 
a brief struggle even in the University of Paris, Nominalism, as 
the Invincible Doctor understood it, found itself triumphant 
once again. 
For William of Ockham faith alone could solve the problem 
of the soul’s existence, a question on which Aristotle always 
seemed to him “ to speak with doubt.” ? He preferred to bend 
his energies to discussing, in precise if peculiar language, the 
origin of knowledge and the meaning of concepts or ideas. But 
beyond the needs of logic he would not go. Logic in his view 
was concerned not with the essences of things—that belonged to 
metaphysics—but with the notions which experience suggested, 
with signs or terms imposed by ourselves. Concepts were the 
1“ Unreasonableness and authority are in a certain sense the stamp 
of truth.” Dr. Harnack (VI, 166-7, n.) points out that Ockham is wholly 
sincere in this plea. He “‘ presents the paradoxical spectacle of a strongly 
pronounced religious nature finding refuge simply in the arbitvary will of 
God”’ (Ib. VI, 310). The Sacraments for him “‘ have simply an impor- 
tance ’’ because God ordained them so (Jb. VI, 227, n.). 
2“ La foi,” says M. Hauréau, “ne l’inquiéte pas ”’ (II, ii, 361). Dr. 
Rashdall quotes Ockham’s Centiloguium Theologicum as proof that he 
‘positively revelled in demonstrating the uncertainty and irrationality 
of the dogmas which as a Theologian he was prepared to swallow with 
dutiful avidity ” (II, 537-8). He adds elsewhere that ‘‘ the Occamists 
put the finishing touch to the downward tendency of scholastic ethics ” 
(The Idea of Atonement, 387). 
%Intelligendo per animam intellectivam formam immaterialem, in- 
corruptibilem, que tota est in toto et tota in qualibet parte, non potest 
sciri evidenter per , . . experientiam quod talis forma sit in nobis, nec 
quod intelligere talis substantize proprium sit in nobis, nec quod talis 
anima sit forma corporis. Quidquid de hoc senserit Aristoteles non curo, 
quia ubique dubitative videtur loqui. Sed ista tria solum fide tenemus ”

things which the logician dealt with, and laboured to distinguish 
and define. It was not the business of logic to decide whether 
“second intentions ’”’ had a real existence. To postulate abstrac- 
tions, to multiply hypotheses and entities did not render clearer 
the approach to truth. The ancient problem of Universals he 
treated with the same strong sense. Man cannot know “the 
Divine essence or the Divine quiddity or anything about the 
teality of God.” He can only form conceptions about them. 
The Saints of old had spoken of the names and not of the attributes 
of God. Modern philosophers might argue that the Divine 
attributes were distinct and diverse ; the older philosophers had 
found the distinction in the names, and the identity and unity 
in the thing signified. These names were signs expressing only 
concepts of the human mind. He had little sympathy with 
some current theories on Divine ideas, none for the view which 
would create fresh abstractions to explain them. He empha- 
sised again the maxim Frustra fit per plura quod fiert potest per 
pauciora. He rejected without hesitation the doctrine that 
Universals had a real existence outside the human mind. He 
brushed aside as irrelevant the inquiry whether the principle 
of individuation lay in matter or in form.? If neither matter 
nor form existed universally, nothing could be gained by inquiring 
to which of them the individual was due. Everything that 
existed was individual, was hec res by the mere fact of its existence. 
Between man and the God who created him neither matter nor 
form could be interposed. Realist efforts to derive the individual 
from the Universal had not helped to make the problem clear. 
The individual was the only reality, the single thing which man’s 
senses could perceive. The Universal was not anything really 
existing. But it was not on the other hand a mere vain imagina- 
tion. It was a mental concept, “‘ signifying at the same time 
several singulars,” found ante rem in the intelligence of God, 
found fost vem in the intelligence of man. Conceptualist rather 
than Nominalist, William of Ockham was yet styled the Aucior 
Nominalium. It has been claimed that his powerful advocacy 
closed in favour of the Nominalists the final chapter of the great 
medizval controversy, as Abélard’s had closed the first. In 
some respects his genius reaches back to Abélard: in some it 
reaches forward towards Luther : in some it reaches even further 
and joins hands with the common-sense philosophy of a later 
1 Hauréau (II, ii, 394). 
2 But Mr. Thorburn points out (see Discussion V in Mind for 1918, 
345 sq.) that the phrase “‘ entia non sunt multiplicanda, preter necessi- 
tatem ” was not Ockham’s. 
3“ Non est querenda causa individuationis.” (See Pluzanski, 231-2, 
and Charles, Roger Bacon, 207.)

day. He ranks as a champion of Nominalist opinion, as a 
trenchant critic of Realist illusions. But his influence in both 
camps, as logician, psychologist and philosopher, was profound. 
If Ockham is not to be ranked among the greatest of medieval 
thinkers,1 he yet introduced a truer method in the world of 
thought. If he avoided almost ostentatiously certain vital 
problems and accepted blindly certain dogmas, if he left un- 
charted that dim region where the medieval Realist groped, not 
altogether vainly, after ideas which common-sense could not 
explain, he yet, within the limits which he fixed for his inquiries, 
taught men that truth was the supreme thing worth pursuing, 
not for the Church’s sake but for its own.? 
“ Ockham,” says Wood, “ by these his inventions did set the 
wits of Oxford to work.” But there was another side to his 
activities, significant of the new part which the Schoolmen were 
to play. He was not only an illustrious philosopher. He was 
a great figure in European politics, one of the leaders in a memor- 
able controversy with the Supreme Head of the Church. His 
influence has been traced in the writings of Marsiglio of Padua, 
the most famous ecclesiastical rebel of thé day, whose plea for 
new ideals of sovereignty and of religion, with its large-minded 
tolerance, its anti-sacerdotal doctrine, its strangely democratic 
note, struck at the root of the medieval theory and anticipated 
the longings of a later age.* He gradually became the champion 
of his Order in the long controversy over evangelical poverty. 
1 His Nominalism, Mr. Harris suggests to me, is not satisfactory, 
because it fails to account for any correspondence between thought and 
things. For Ockham’s influence on Luther and Luther’s Nominalist 
traditions see Paquier’s translation of Denifle, Luther et le Luthéranisme 
(III, 191-232). s 
2 For Ockham’s life and writings see, among other authorities, P. J. 
Hofer’s two articles in Archivum Franciscanum Historicum (VI, 209-33 
and 439-65), which on some points modify Dr. Poole’s article in D.N.B.,

Goldast’s Monarch. S. Roman. Imp. (1614, II, 313 sq.) ; and among Ock- 
ham’s writings his Summa logices or Summa Totius Logica, his Commen- 
tavii on Aristotle, his Questiones on the Sentences and ‘‘ in octo libros 
physicorum,”’ his Quodlibeta Septem, his treatises De sacramento altaris and 
De corpore Christi, and his Centiloquium theologicum. Mr. Little, to whom 
I am so often indebted, has given a careful list of both the political and 
the philosophical writings. But it is not‘easy to point out the connec- 
tion between the two. It was perhaps loyalty to his Order rather than 
philosophy which led Ockham to criticise ecclesiastical abuses. 
8 The argument of Marsiglio’s Defensor Pacis is clearly sketched in 
Dr. Poole’s little volume on Wycliffe and Movements for Reform (28 sq.). 
See also Goldast (Monarch. 154 sq.). But it must not be assumed that 
Ockham was ever associated with Marsiglio at Paris.

He boldly defended the theory that the Franciscans did not and 
ought not to hold property of their own—a theory which increased 
their claim to holiness, and which threatened alarming conse- 
quences if applied to the Church as an institution.1 The Popes 
in their “ Babylonish captivity”? at Avignon not unnaturally 
refused to countenance this doctrine, and William of Ockham 
had other grounds as well for turning his powerful batteries on 
them.2 There were plenty of abuses in Church and Papacy 
open to attack. Summoned by John XXII to answer for his 
heresies, he retorted by accusing the Pope himself of heresy. 
Flung into a Papal prison at Avignon, he escaped in 1328 down 
the Rhone in a boat, and threw himself upon the Emperor’s 
protection. Louis the Bavarian, who had his own sharp quarrel 
with the Papacy, was quite ready to welcome so useful an ally. 
“O Imperator, defende me gladio, et ego defendam te verbo” 
—so, tradition says, the fugitive philosopher proudly appealed 
for the Prince’s support. And in the years that followed, in 
spite of Papal excommunications, he continued his intrepid 
activities at Munich, in the little cosmopolitan society of free 
spirits gathered round the Emperor there, studying, pamphlet- 
eering, attending Councils, defending his Order, challenging the 
pretensions of the Holy See, maintaining the authority of the 
Emperors and their independence alike of Avignon and Rome. 
The Schoolman had developed into the Reformer. The logician 
had found new, practical, Imperial problems to debate. The 
Friar, even if in the end reconciled to the Church whose anathemas 
he so long defied, had raised issues which the assailants of the 
Papal system were never likely to forget. 
John Duns Scotus and William of Ockham mark the climax 
of the long-drawn tournament, through which, like knights 
encumbered by their heavy armour, the thinkers of the Middle 
Ages moved. The years which separate Duns Scotus from 
Wycliffe were in Oxford years of vigorous intellectual life. The 
science of theology was the Schoolmen’s main pre-occupation, 
but they claimed the whole field of science for their own. Natural 
1Duns Scotus’ De Perfectione Statuum—if it be Duns’—was an in- 
teresting anticipation of Ockham on this point. 
2 Hofer shows (Archiv. Francisc. Hist. VI, 439-65) that it was Ockham’s 
theological and philosophic doctrines, rather than his views on the poverty 
of Christ, which led the Pope to summon him to Avignon to answer for 
his heresies. In its narrow sense the Friars’ plea was little more than 
a legal quibble. They admitted that they had the use of property, but 
asserted that its ownership was vested in the Pope. In 1322 John XXII 
swept away this complacent theory by declaring that use was inseparable 
from ownership, and by depriving the Order of the right to hold property 
in the name of the Roman See. (See Little, Grey Friars, 77, and Poole, 
Wycliffe, 22 sq.)

220 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
philosophers were as ready to dogmatise about the “ primum 
mobile,’ to “render a reason for thunder, winds, eclipses and 
other inexplicable things,” 1 as divines to descant on original 
sin. Copernicus and Galileo found it as hard as Colet or Erasmus 
to let the light into the dim and venerable traditions which 
had so long passed for science in the Schools. But before the 
fourteenth century ended Scholasticism had done its work. Its 
supremacy was over. Its decline had begun. Its catchwords 
were still popular, perhaps more popular than ever. Its rivalries, 
descending from the Schools into the streets, furnished new 
excuses for the quarrels of the Nations, supplied new battle-cries 
for graduate and undergraduate brawls. Moreover, it began 
to touch practical problems, questions of government and social 
order, which gave it a fresh vitality and a closer interest in 
national concerns. It continued indeed to produce new Doctors. 
Richard Holcot, the intrepid Dominican, laboured to prove that 
Thomas Aquinas and William of Ockham had defended the same 
principles, that natural truths were one thing and revealed truths 
another thing, that philosophers and theologians were not bound 
to agree. Adam Woodham or Godham, one of the most remark- 
able of the later Franciscans, ‘‘ a modest man,” not inferior, some 
thought, in doctrine or ability to Ockham,? followed the Invincible 
Doctor at Oxford, wrote on the Sentences, and probably lectured 
in the convent there. The Secular clergy, less wedded than the 
Regulars to the Realist tradition, came to the front in philosophy, 
and handed the Nominalist tradition on. At Paris and at Vienna 
the new methods and ideas gained ground. Pierre d’Ailly, 
famous as teacher and as Churchman, made them paramount 
before the end of the century in the College of Navarre. As 
science became more rational and independent, and turned her 
back deliberately on the field of faith, theology in her turn 
became more mystical, more certain than ever of the miracles 
whose reasonableness it was no longer necessary to prove. And 
the most brilliant of William of Ockham’s disciples, Jean Charlier 
de Gerson, reformer, statesman, philosopher, divine, who ruled 
the University of Paris after Pierre d’Ailly till Henry V became 
the ruler of France, combined with a clear and authoritative 
Nominalism the mystical piety of Bonaventura, and turned 
unsatisfied from the ‘‘ cob-webs’’ of the Schoolmen, to contem- 
plate directly the vision of God. 
In a sense, it is true, the long, devoted labours of the School- 
men failed. They proved unable to identify reason with religion, 
or to solve the insoluble problems of the world. Their narrow,

edition, 462).

  THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY SCHOOLMEN 221 
rigorous methods, their infinite sophistications, confined the 
studies and exhausted the patience of mankind. ‘‘ The fame of 
them all shall perish with them,” cried Petrarch: ‘‘ one tomb 
shall suffice for their name and their bones.”? And yet for 
centuries the Schoolmen trained the intellect of Europe in habits 
of precise and reasoned thought. They spoke a peculiar language, 
but they taught men to appreciate how much and how little 
words could mean. They inspired a passion for knowledge. 
They led generation after generation to think on large and lofty 
themes. And their bold questionings, their daring speculations, 
circumscribed by superstition though they were, became, in 
John of Salisbury’s phrase, ‘‘ torches of war” in the conflict 
with unreason, torches which may at times have made the 
shadows darker, but which helped to illuminate the way to 
freedom. 
Wycliffe stands at the beginning of a new era. With him 
the days of Oxford Movements have arrived. But to the prestige 
and traditions of the Schoolmen he owed no small part of his 
authority and fame. He was essentially a son of Oxford. It 
was there that he won celebrity as the greatest living clerk. It 
was there that his opinions found their stronghold. It was there 
that he spent the chief part of his life. And it was through him 
that the University first applied its spirit and its genius to shaping 
the practical problems of the time. Yet a curious uncertainty 
hangs over his Oxford career. There are records of a John 
Wycliffe at four Colleges, Balliol, Merton, Queen’s and Canter- 
bury, during the Reformer’s lifetime, and reasons well worth 
consideration have been found for identifying him with each. 
But there were at least three contemporary bearers of his name, 
or of a name which sounded very like it.2_ One became the Vicar 
of Mayfield * in 136z, under the shadow of Archbishop Islip’s 
palace ; and he may conceivably have been a Fellow of Merton 
in 1356. Another, afterwards unknown to fame, was a Poor 
Boy at Queen’s in 1371-72.4 And the third and greatest was 
1 Quoted by Mullinger (I, 433, n.). 
2 The name is spelt in some twenty different ways, Wycliffe, Wiclif, 
Wyclyve, Whytecliff and many others, The date of Wycliffe’s birth is 
uncertain ; Dr, Rashdall inclines to place it after 1324. 
3 Mayfield was a Vicarage, not a Rectory (Taxatio Ecclesiastica of 
Pope Nicholas IV, printed by the Commissioners of Public Records, p. 138). 
«The Poor Boy’s name is not said to be John. Of the six or seven 
entries in the College accounts printed in Dr. Magrath’s notes (The Queen’s 
College, II, 112), which contain the name of Wycliffe in one form or 
another, only one, in 1374-5, gives the name John. But the Wycliffes 
of Merton, Mayfield and Canterbury College were all called John. I 
cannot think with;Dr. Rashdall (D.N.B.) that the Poor Boy of 1371-2 
might be the Master John Wiclife who rented a room in 1374-5.
-P-A-G-E-253
  222 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
the Northern student, hailing from a Yorkshire village not far 
from the Balliols’ old home, who was undoubtedly Master of 
John Balliol’s little College in 1360-61. He may have been 
elected to the Mastership a few years before that. He was 
probably a Fellow of Balliol first, and may possibly have been 
enabled by the new Somervyle Statutes to stay on there and 
study theology after taking his~Arts. degree. He may, it is 
equally possible, have been a Fellow of Merton for a time. In 
1361 he accepted the living of Fillingham—‘ value thirty 
marks’’; and though his connection with the University was 
never broken, his connection with Balliol apparently ceased. 
In the same year he applied for a Prebend at York, which was 
not granted. Buta Prebend in the collegiate church of Westbury 
was offered him instead. Later on his name was connected with 
a Prebend and Canonry at Lincoln, which he most likely never 
enjoyed. There are good grounds for thinking that he had 
rooms at Queen’s College between 1363 and 1366, and again in 
1374-75, and yet again in 1380-81. And evidence which it is 
difficult to resist identifies him with the Master John de Wyclyve,? 
who was made Warden of Canterbury College in December 
1365, when the seculars displaced the monks, and who was 
expelled from that post later when the monks triumphed over 
their opponents.’ In 1368 he exchanged the living of Fillingham 
1Mr. H. S. Cronin suggests (Eng. Hist. Rev., 1920, 564-9) that the 
Lincoln Canonry went to Philip de Thornbury, the son of an English 
mercenary leader in the Pope’s service. In his paper on John Wycliffe, 
the Reformer, and Canterbury Hall, reprinted in 1914 from the Royal 
Historical Society’s Transactions (3rd Series, vol. VIII) he suggests that 
Wycliffe held the Westbury Prebend from 1362 to 1375 and gravely 
neglected his duties. But he does not seem to have followed this point 
up. The paper is not quite free from prejudice. 
2 The appointment-is recorded in Archbishop Islip’s Register at Lam- 
beth (f. 306%), and was made at Mayfield. 
This problem of identification is a well-known difficulty. The 
arguments against it, which deserve respect, are summed up by Dr. 
Shirley (Fasciculi Zizaniorum, 513 sq.) and Dr. Rashdall (article on 
Wycliffe in D.N.B.). But these arguments, suggested in part by articles 
and correspondence in the Gentleman’s Magazine (1841, II, 146-8, 378-9 
and 591-2, and 1844, II, 136), are answered with skill though perhaps 
with some little over-statement in Mr. Cronin’s paper on John Wycliffe 
and Canterbury Hall, as well as by Lechler in his Life of Wycliffe (tr. 
Lorimer, 103 sg., ed: 1884). Those who think the Warden was not the 
Reformer but the Vicar of Mayfield, lay stress on Archbishop Islip’s con- 
nection with Mayfield, on his alleged intention to annex that living to 
the Wardenship, on the silence of some chroniclers and critics like Walden, 
on the suggestion that the Warden had previously been a scholar of the 
Hall, and on the strangely indifferent tone in which the Reformer refers 
to the subject (De Ecclesia, ed. Loserth, 371). On these points it may 
be said that Islip’s intention of annexing the Mayfield living is apocryphal, 
if it rests only on the passage to which Dr. Shirley refers, where Archbishop

for one at Ludgershall. From Ludgershall after a few years he 
passed on to Lutterworth. About 1372 apparently he became 
a Doctor of Divinity at Oxford, and in 1377’ Black Hall seems 
to have been his temporary home. At Oxford he added to his 
reputation daily as a teacher ‘“‘ incomparable in scholastic 
exercises.” And from Oxford he was drawn by the needs of 
an ambitious Prince, but even more by his own strong sense of 
public duty, to play a great part in national affairs. 
Parker stated long afterwards (De Antiquitate Britannice Ecclesia, ed. 
1572, 274) that Islip appropriated (appropriauit) the Rectories of May- 
field and Pagham to the College. This is not a statement of Islip’s in- 
tentions, but only an error of fact. The suggestion that the Warden had 
previously been a scholar of the College is also probably a mistake. If 
that was “an impossible position for the Vicar of Fillingham,”’ the same 
difficulty would apply to the Vicar of Mayfield. The suggestion, made 
by Lewis (12-13), rests on a vague statement taken from Langham’s 
defence, which may only mean that he thought the College ought to be 
ruled by a monk and not by a secular Fellow. The statement refers to 
1367. I do not attach much importance to the wording of the Regia 
pardonatio of 1372 (Lewis, 248). ‘The silence of Walden is rather curious, 
but he wrote some fifty years after the event. More curious is the cool 
detachment of the Reformer’s tone in the De Ecclesia. But neither point 
is conclusive; and on the other side the indications that the Warden 
was the Reformer are very difficult to resist. First we have two contem- 
porary statements, one by the Monk of St. Albans (Chronicon Anglia, 
ed. Thompson, 115), which though vague in form is more applicable to 
the Reformer than to anyone else, the other, clear and positive, by William 
Woodford, who knew Wycliffe well at Oxford (Little, Grey Friars, 81 and 
246-9) and could hardly have failed to know the facts. On this important 
point, and on some others, Shirley’s argument is much weakened by more 
recent information. Next there is the fact that nothing we know about 
the Reformer’s life makes his appointment as Warden improbable: on 
the contrary it fits in curiously well with such information as we have. 
After the Warden’s expulsion the Reformer is found at Queen’s—I think 
this can hardly be doubted. At Queen’s also are found two supporters 
of the Warden, Middleworth and Selby, who had been expelled with him 
(Magrath, The Queen’s College, 115-16). The Warden is described as 
Magister, the Reformer’s proper title in 1365; the Vicar of Mayfield is 
always called Dominus, a term not applicable to a Master. The Warden’s 
name, amid all the vagaries of medizval spelling, seems always to be spelt 
without a ‘“‘t,”’ and the Vicar of Mayfield’s, as such, always to be spelt 
with one: Whytecliff is the favourite form for him. Approaching the 
subject with some bias in favour of Dr. Rashdall’s view, I find myself 
driven to the conclusion that the evidence identifying the Warden with 
the Reformer is much stronger than the evidence on the other side. I 
know of no proof that the Vicar of Mayfield was a Fellow of Merton in 
1356. But Mr. Cronin, quoting Islip’s Register (f. 316>), suggests that 
the Archbishop ‘‘may have come.across him through Merton Priory, 
on whose title he ordained a certain John Whytecliff, of the diocese of 
Salisbury, subdeacon in 1356.” See also later (pp. 274—5 and 305-6).

224 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
The clerks who listened to Wycliffe’s lectures could hardly 
have failed to watch with keen anxiety the issues between Church 
and State, between Papal claims and national independence, 
which overshadowed the history of the time. The splendid days 
of Crecy and Poitiers had departed. Disillusion and exhaustion 
had followed in their train. Since the Black Death silent eco- 
nomic changes had transformed the life and temper of the people. 
The Government, in which prelates and nobles struggled for 
supremacy, was inefficient and unpopular. Parliament was un- 
easy and suspicious. Trade languished. The mastery of the seas 
was lost. The Black Prince, with his glory behind him, was 
slowly dying in his Palace at Kennington.1 His father was in 
his dotage, his son too young to rule. His brother, John of 
Gaunt, with his vast heritage of Lancaster and his dreams of a 
Crown in Spain if not at home, was a dangerous and overpowering 
influence too near the throne. The selfish aims of the great 
feudal magnates, the wealth and privileges of the Church, the 
ever-increasing demands, the ever-diminishing reputation of 
the Papacy, the deep and inarticulate discontent of the un- 
represented classes, threatened the whole social order of the 
State. The French Popes in the “ sinful city of Avenon,” living 
in luxury and trafficking in corruption, could not count on 
obedience in England. ‘‘ Bibamus papaliter,” let us drink like 
a Pope, was supposed to be a favourite exhortation with Benedict 
XII. The rival Pontiffs of the Great Schism; who followed, 
were more concerned to suppress each other than to purify the 
Church. While Wycliffe at Lutterworth was heralding the 
Reformation, Urban VI was torturing his Cardinals and preaching 
a Crusade against the Anti-Pope. The one thing constant in 
Papal policy was the system of exactions it enforced.? The 
Papal appointments to English benefices, the foreign nominees 
thrust in, the appeals from English Courts to Rome, the annual 
biographies Dr. Lechler’s (tr. by Prof. Lorimer) has largely superseded 
the earlier lives by J. Lewis, R. Vaughan and others—though Lewis 
prints some useful documents. More lately Dr. R. L. Poole’s Wycliffe 
and Movements for Reform, Mr. G. M. Trevelyan’s Age of Wycliffe, Dr. 
Rashdall’s article in D.N.B., and Mr. Cronin’s pamphlet on John Wycliffe 
and Canterbury Hall, have added to our knowledge. Mr. F. D. Matthew’s 
Introduction to The English Works of Wyclif is of value, and Mr. L. Ser- 
geant’s volume is popular and useful. For Wycliffe’s writings see the 
publications of the Wyclif Society, the Catalogue by Shirley, the lists 
given by Lechler (App. VII) and Rashdall (D.N.B.), and other references 
mentioned in these notes. 
1 He died in July 1376, the old King, his father, in June 1377. 
2 England was a great field for Papal impositions (see Stubbs, Con- 
stitutional History, III, ch. XIX). The Statutes of Provisors and of 
Premunire, in 1351 and 1393, directed against Papal patronage and 
appeals to Rome, afford strong proof of the prevailing abuses.

tribute to the Pontiff—an evil legacy from a worthless King— 
the ancient Peter’s pence, the fees and dues and so-called volun- 
tary offerings, the greedy Papal collectors travelling round— 
these things were difficult to tolerate when Pope and Church 
alike had lost respect. The Mendicant Orders, once a stronghold 
of Papal influence, had long since yielded to the temptations, and 
ceased to command the admiration, of the world. ‘‘ The earth 
is ruined by covetise,’”’ sang one of the contemporaries of Chaucer, 
‘for no man careth but to fill his bags.” 4 
Ecclesiastics still played a large part in the government of 
England. But that did not make the Church more popular. 
Prelates like Bishop Courtenay of London, Wycliffe’s earliest 
opponent, or Archbishop Sudbury, who in 138r was murdered 
by the mob, or Bishop Despencer of Norwich, once a soldier of 
fortune in the Papal armies and always better fitted for a camp 
than for a choir, or William of Wykeham, the famous Bishop of 
Winchester, to whose failings Oxford cannot be unkind, forfeited 
public confidence when affairs went ill. ‘‘ Cesarean clergy,’ 
as Wycliffe described them, worldlings bent on secular dominion, 
filled high place in Church and State. English livings were left 
vacant or neglected. Ill-paid substitutes did duty for the absen- 
tees. The ecclesiastical Courts were full of abuses. Ecclesiastical 
offenders often went unscathed. The sale of indulgences, the 
prevalence of pluralities, the pressure of clerical offerings and 
tithes and dues,? steadily sapped the laity’s allegiance. Men 
noted ever with less and less tolerance the grave failings of the 
parish clergy, the decadence of monks and Friars, the too familiar 
devices of Pardoner and Pilgrim, the too well authenticated 
stories of clerical blackmail, the large community of useless 
clerks whose only tools were prayers and psalters, and whose 
only occupation was “ as heirs of heaven”’ to beg. The mysteries 
of religion were ceasing to be mysteries. It was not only clerks 
who carped at them in “ crabbed words.” Wealthy laymen also 
would discuss them

  226 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Public opinion was ripe for a movement, not only against the 
power and privileges which the Church misused, but against the 
positive beliefs which she embodied, and from Oxford the leader 
of that movement came. 
We cannot be quite sure of the date when the well-known 
Oxford Schoolman stepped into the political arena. But before 
he became a politician he was already a theologian of repute. 
If Wycliffe does not rank with the greatest of the Schoolmen in 
power or originality of mind, he was yet the last of the great 
medieval Realists. But his Realism was of a moderate and 
enlightened type. He rejected the philosophy of William of 
Ockham, while he inherited his political independence. He 
owed much to Bradwardine, much to Fitz-Ralph, much to St. 
Anselm, and much to Plato.1 He carried on the return to 
Augustine which Bradwardine had begun. He shared the Au- 
gustinian views of most of the early Reformers. For Wycliffe 
Universals had only an ‘intelligible and possible’ existence. 
They were realised in the individual. They existed eternally 
in the mind of God. The will of God, eternal and unchangeable, 
was not capable of arbitrary decrees, or of granting the unjustifi- 
able privileges which Christ’s Vicars on earth sometimes ventured 
to grant in His name. Wycliffe’s insistence on predestination 
and on the necessity of grace did not destroy his belief in human 
freedom. Through all his obscure and tortuous Latinity—as 
uncouth as any that the Schools produced—there showed a 
strong and penetrating mind, keenly alive to the ethical side of 
Christianity, deeply conscious of the humanity of Christ. The 
speculative Schoolman met the practical Reformer. The preacher 
developed into the pamphleteer. In treatises and lectures; in 
tracts and sermons—his literary output was extraordinary as his 
years advanced—he passed from discussions of logic, from ques- 
tions as to the origin of man, to theories of Church and State, of 
Civil and Divine Dominion, of the functions of the Pastor and 
the functions of the King. From thence he advanced to 
great debates on doctrine, to interpretations of the Eucharist, to 
polemics on monks and Friars, to a bold challenge to the power 
of Pope and Anti-Christ—not always for Wycliffe separable 
things. From obscure Latinity he turned to trenchant English, 
and appealed to his countrymen in tones that all could under- 
stand. And the plain, quaint English of the Twelve Conclusions, 
which his followers urged upon Parliament ten years after his 
death, has a force which no medizval Latin could attain. 
1 He seems to have drawn his views on Predestination largely from 
Bradwardine, and his views on Dominion largely from Fitz-Ralph.

“‘ Qwan the Chirche of Yngeland began to dote in temporalte after 
her stepmodir, the grete Chirche of Rome, and chirchis were slayne, 
be appropriacion to divers placys, feyth, hope and charite begunne 
for to fle out of oure Chirche. For pride with his sori genealogie of 
dedly synnes chalingith it be title of heritage.” 
Wycliffe’s famous Doctrine of Dominion, with its feudal 
view of lordship and of service, and its daring new appeal for a 
hierarchy severed from the temptations of worldliness and wealth, 
brought into Church politics the theories of the Schools.? God, 
the lord of all, gave men dominion in return for service. No 
intervening vassals, no mediating priesthood, interrupted the 
direct relation between God and man, the direct dependence on 
Him of layman and of priest alike. But dominion was founded 
in grace. The righteous man standing in grace had dominion 
over the whole sensible world. The wicked man on the other 
hand had nothing. “The faithful hath the whole world of 
riches, but the unfaithful hath not even a farthing.’ A man’s 
character not his office made him what he was. Bad potentates, 
even bad Popes, lost their right to dominion, if they lacked the 
grace on which all power reposed. The law of Christ was the 
only real foundation of all laws which men accepted, even 
of laws regulating property and wealth. Spiritual, evangelic 
dominion, conferred by Christ upon ecclesiastics, did not involve 
rights of property or jurisdiction. Temporal power and conquests 
and possessions belonged to the kingdoms of earth and not to 
the kingdom of the Church. Priests who did their duty in a 
life of simple poverty would never lack offerings from their 
flocks. But if by mortal sin they forfeited dominion, their 
claim to tribute, offerings and tithes failed also. Excommuni- 
cation of a man was only valid provided that the man had sinned. 
Even the Pope’s decrees were only binding so far as they carried 
out the Gospel law, the will of God. If the Church exceeded its 
proper functions, the State might intervene and vindicate its 
own authority. Transitory, and subject to modification and to 
error, as all Civil Lordship was, it might yet be necessary to 
accept it, to yield obedience to constituted rulers, even to tyrants 
for the time. In that sense there was meaning in the startling 
paradox that God must sometimes obey the Devil. Even to

difficult to date Wycliffe’s works, but most of those we know probably 
belong to the latter years of his life.

228 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
the wicked we must give their due: But righteousness, grace, 
was the only source of natural authority; the law of Holy 
Scripture was the only fundamental rule. And grace, moreover, 
was the only source of ownership. In theory at any rate Wycliffe 
did not draw back from the conclusion that to the righteous, 
the lords of the universe, the common stock of the world’s goods 
belonged. A wise theologian would determine nothing rashly, 
wherever his political prepossessions might lead, but ‘‘ according 
to law he would affirm that it were better that all things should 
be in common,” + 
It is easy to understand the influence of these doctrines in 
a society conscious of grave abuses and already stirred by 
discontent. Wycliffe was no advocate of revolution, though 
fearless in attacking wrong. He would not at first apply his 
theory to the circumstances round him without careful and 
elaborate reserves. But his hearers cared chiefly for its applica- 
tion, and quickly swept his reserves away. His first political 
pamphlet, on:the right of the State to deal with the property 
of delinquent churchmen, and on the burning question of the 
tribute to the Pope, may date from 1366, or more probably 
from some years later.2 But in 1374 he-was sent officially to 
Bruges to negotiate with the Pope’s delegates in regard to Church 
appointments. He was drawn into association with John of 
Gaunt. He was accused of ‘‘ barking against the Church,” of 
running from pulpit to pulpit to expound his dangerous opinions. 
His high-minded plea for poverty in the Church appealed strongly 
to great lords like Lancaster and Percy, who saw in the demand 
for disendowment a prospect of profit for themselves. If the 
Good Parliament of 1376 revolted against Lancaster and his 
rascally dependents, there was always a possibility that the 
Duke might regain his popularity by a crusade against the riches 
of the Church. If so, the De Civili Dominio might help to supply 
the argument required. There is little doubt that the Duke 
saw in the great Schoolman an instrument for winning the 
nation to his side. And it was largely as the Duke’s ally that the 
Bishops attacked Wycliffe, and summoned-him to answer for 
heresy in 1377. 
The old chronicler has depicted for us the dramatic scene 
which followed at St. Paul’s—Wycliffe’s appearance in the 
crowded Cathedral, escorted not only by four Friars from Oxford 
but by the greatest nobles in the country, Percy’s overbearing 
insolence, Bishop Courtenay’s stout resistance, Lancaster's

* 2-Dr. Loserth argues with some force for a date ten years later than 
1366 (Eng. Hist. Rev. XI, 319 sq.). Wycliffe describes himself as “‘ peculi- 
aris regis clericus”’; his connection with the Court had begun.

fierce threat that he would pull down the proud Bishop for all 
his Royal kin, the indignant Londoners, devoted to their Bishop 
and trembling for their liberties, breaking loose at last, the 
mob’s attack on the Duke’s Palace in the Savoy, the unloved 
Duke’s escape by water to take refuge with the Black Prince’s 
widow on the Surrey shore.t_ The proceedings came to nothing. 
The Reformer went unharmed, and he lost none of his popularity 
with the public. But before the year was over, the Pope had 
intervened. A Bull addressed to the Chancellor of the University 
of Oxford accused Wycliffe of teaching the doctrines of Marsiglio, 
and bade the University hand him over to the Primate and the 
Bishop of London. Other Bulls from Rome enforced the attack. 
And early in 1378, in the Archbishop’s Chapel at Lambeth, 
another abortive trial took place. The articles left the charges 
in no doubt. The Reformer had questioned the Papacy’s claims 
to political dominion, the validity of excommunication and of 
spiritual censures, the priest’s power to bind and loose. He 
had insisted on the need of grace, on the duty of conforming to 
the law of Christ, on the right of temporal authorities to call 
the Church and her rulers to account, and to deprive her of ~ 
her possessions if they were misused. On these points Popes 
and Bishops were certain to attack him, but the heart of the 
nation was upon his side. The young King’s mother forbade 
the Bishops to assail him. The citizens of London broke into 
the Chapel at Lambeth to protect his cause. The trial ended 
with a weak injunction not to preach his doctrines on account 
* of the scandal they excited. But that injunction neither he 
nor his followers obeyed. 
Oxford still supported Wycliffe loyally. His friends there 
had promptly protested against the Pope’s right to order the 
imprisonment of an English subject. The Proctors had been 
slow to act upon the Papal Bull. The Chancellor and the Doctors 
of Theology had declared Wycliffe’s conclusions to be true. 
The Chancellor’s deputy, who had confined him for a time to 
Black Hall, was deprived of his office. The Government was 
still his friend. In the autumn of 1377 Parliament had consulted 
him as to the lawfulness of stopping payments due to foreign 
holders of benefices in England. In 1378—and, it may be, 
earlier also—Wycliffe seems to have attended Parliament.* He

doubtful. But the view here taken seems to be the most likely.

arrange them to number nineteen; some give only thirteen. It is said 
that fifty were sent ‘out to Rome.

Theology in 1378. Dr. Poole (Wycliffe, 78) suggests that he may have

even ventured to defend Lancaster’s ‘high-handed violation of 
sanctuary at Westminster, which had resulted in the death of 
Robert Hale. But he could hardly have failed to realise the 
doubtful aims and practices of some of his political allies. In 
the same year, 1378, the Great Schism broke up the unity of 
Christendom, and shook afresh the authority of the Popes. 
And Wycliffe, disappointed perhaps in his hope of securing 
political reform from turbulent and selfish factions, threw into 
the work of doctrinal and spiritual reformation all the great 
energies of his remaining years. 
It was to the people that the famous Schoolman turned, 
and through the voice of Oxford that he moved them. He 
organised and sent out his poor priests, to advocate a simpler 
faith, a purer Church, and to supplement the ordinary parish 
services by teaching English people in the English tongue. 
He “ gathered round him,” says a monkish chronicler, “‘ many 
disciples in his pravity, living together in Oxford, clad in long 
russet gowns of one pattern, going on foot, ventilating his errors 
among the people.’ 1 They were no mere ignorant evangelists. 
They were in many cases University students and educated men, 
drawn from the greatest scholastic centre of the day. But 
they understood the value of the missionary system which the 
later Friars had abused. Wycliffe himself was at first no enemy 
of the Friars. On the contrary, he claimed their support. He 
was prepared to imitate some of their methods. To his mind 
they contrasted favourably with the richly endowed monastic 
Orders. Their doctrine of poverty he thoroughly approved. 
But as time went on, his hostility to monks and Friars alike 
increased. He could not fail to see the defects of their practice, 
the uselessness of much of the monastic life, the many evils 
which mendicancy led to, the grave abuses which it encouraged 
and maintained. As incumbent of a parish he may possibly 
have learned to resent the Friars’ interference. He resented 
still more their unfriendliness to his own poor priests. Even 
before they attacked his doctrines, he had become a stern critic 
of their faults. And his followers joined with gusto in the 
fray. The Friars were denounced as Iscariot’s children, as 
disciples of Satan, as perilous enemies to Holy Church. Disciples 
are apt to go beyond their Master, and Wycliffe’s missionaries, 
issuing from Oxford, no doubt exaggerated his opinions and 
been present earlier, “in his quality of royal chaplain.” But in neither 
capacity could he have had any regular claim to be present. A special 
appearance on a special occasion is not impossible. (See the anonymous 
Continuation of Adam of Murimuth’s Chronicle, ed. T. Hog, 234.) 
1See Chron. Anglie (395), and Knighton (Chron. II, 184). 
2 Lovers of precedents may even find in Wycliffe’s priests the first 
experiment in University extension,
-P-A-G-E-262
  THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY SCHOOLMEN 231 
pressed the meaning of his language too far. Before long he 
was able to supply them with weapons more formidable than any 
utterances of his own. For he had plunged into the noble work 
of translating the Bible. The great Protestant appeal to the 
authority of Scripture had begun. 
As yet, in spite of the powerful interests which he had offended, 
Wycliffe had proved invulnerable to attack. His daring criticism 
of abuses had found wide support. His character, his learning, 
his argumentative resources had confounded his opponents. 
His simplicity and courage had appealed deeply to the people. 
In London Princes and nobles had stood by him. In Oxford 
theologians and students, the younger men especially, had béen 
content to follow in his footsteps. But in the last four years 
of his life these circumstances altered. The peasants’ rising in 
1381, with its dangerous challenge to Crown and Church and 
social order, the horrible days of rioting and slaughter, the panic- 
stricken gatherings in the Tower, the murder of Chancellor and 
Treasurer, Primate and Chief Justice, the still worse peril averted 
only by the rare courage of the boy King, produced inevitably 
a fierce reaction. In politics Wycliffe was no leveller, no preacher 
of revolt. There was nothing except prejudice to connect him 
with the rebels who hunted down the friends of John of Gaunt. 
But it was not difficult to represent his theories on the misuse 
of property and power as incitements to mischief and subversive 
of the State. And while the alarm produced by the rising 
told naturally against his teaching, a movement which gave the 
Church a new handle against him had been developing in the 
Reformer’s mind. Before the rebellion was over, it was realised 
that Wycliffe in his conflict with clerical tradition had taken 
an irretraceable step. He had in effect been driven to challenge 
the central tenet of the medieval Church. 
For some years past he had felt doubts about accepting 
the ordinary view of Transubstantiation, the theory that the 
priest by the mere power of his priesthood could perform a daily 
miracle in the Mass, and change the substance of the bread 
and wine into the substance of the body and blood of Christ. 
1 When Wycliffe began his translation from the Vulgate is uncertain. 
It is unlikely that any part of it was widely known before 1381. He 
worked chiefly, it seems, on the New Testament, and his disciple Nicholas 
Hereford on the Old. John Purvey, his faithful curate or companion at 
Lutterworth, revised it all. It may have been completed about 1388. 
The MS. of Hereford’s translation is in the Bodleian (MS. 959): he 
translated the Old Testament as far as the twentieth verse of the third 
chapter of the book of Baruch. Cardinal Gasquet’s doubts in regard to 
the Wycliffite tradition are answered by Mr. F. D. Matthew in a note 
on The Authorship of the Wycliffite Bible (Eng. Hist. Review, 1895, X, 
91-9). 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
  232 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
He hesitated to admit that the accidents, the sensible properties, 
of the bread and wine remained, when their substance was 
destroyed and replaced. He clung to the belief in Christ’s 
real presence in. the Sacrament, but the longer he examined 
and discussed it, the harder he found it to explain. Even while 
a ‘‘Sententiary ”’ .and a Responding Bachelor at Oxford, says 
one of his assailants, ‘‘ he held publicly and in'the Schools that, 
although the Sacramental accidents were in.a subject, yet that 
the bread ceased to exist at consecration. .And being much 
questioned as to what was the subject of those accidents, first for 
a considerable time he replied that it was a.mathematical body. 
Afterwards, when this position had’ been much argued against, he 
answered that he did not know what the subject of the accidents 
was, yet he asserted clearly that they had a subject. Now in 
these articles and in his confession he lays down expressly that 
the bread remains after consecration and is the subject of the 
accidents.” No doubt, as Wycliffe’s views developed, his opinions 
fluctuated a good deal. They were easy to criticise. They were 
not always clear or consistent. And he did not perhaps convince 
himself entirely by resorting to figments of the Schools. As 
early as 1367, if the sermon be rightly dated, he had found it 
“enough for the Christian to believe that the body of Christ 
was in some spiritual, sacramental manner at every point of 
the consecrated Host.’’ And as time passed, he came nearer 
and nearer to interpreting the real, presence in a spiritual sense, 
to making the bread and wine the sign of the reality rather than 
the reality itself.2 He never completely abandoned the old 
tradition. But he was driven to abandon the theory that the 
priest could change the substance, could “‘make the body of

which follows, and which very likely does injustice to Wycliffe’s views,

Wycliffe’s English Works (xxiii-iv).- -Wood’s comments are interesting 
(Ann. I, 498 and 513). 
*Sir H. C. M. Lyte pleads (262-3) for Wycliffe’s consistency in the 
later years of his life. But it is not easy to reconcile the passage, for 
instance, in his Confession (Select English Works, III, 502)—‘‘ Right as 
the persoun of Crist is verrey God and, mon—verrey Godhed and verrey 
monhed—tight so, holy Kirke, mony hundred winters, have trowed, the 
same sacrament is verrey God’s body and verrey bred ’’—with this state- 
ment quoted in Fascic. Zizan. (105)—‘‘ The consecrated host which we 
see on the altar is neither Christ nor any part of him, but the effectual 
sign of him.’’ The Confession given in Knighton (1, 161) probably 
represents Wycliffe’s opinion fairly enough—that the consecrated bread 
was ina sense God’s body without ceasing to be bread: it was ‘‘ both 
together.” There is some excuse for Melancthon’s criticism that Wycliffe’s 
view was confused: but it would not be fair to accept as his opinions 
all that critics and chroniclers put into his mouth,

Christ,” and with it to abandon the loftiest pretension, the 
proudest claim on which the hierarchy reposed. 
It was only by degrees that Wycliffe’s final position was 
established, and he never perhaps threw over all reserves and 
doubts. But he parted company frankly with the orthodox 
view, and even before his theory was fully developed, he found 
it assailed in a quarter where he had long looked for support. 
At Oxford the Chancellor, William Berton, was an old opponent. 
Without attacking Wycliffe personally, he induced twelve Doctors 
of Theology and Law to condemn the new doctrines put forth 
by ‘‘ certain persons filled with the counsel of the Evil Spirit.” 
| Their decision was proclaimed and published while Wycliffe 
was lecturing at the Austin Friars.1 He appealed at once to 
the King. But the sympathies of the authorities were no longer 
on his side. John of Gaunt, ready enough to despoil the clergy 
of their riches, drew back from the risk of denying their beliefs. 
He would not hear of the new “ detestable opinion.’’ He bade 
Wycliffe talk of it no more. The rebellion had taught its own 
lessons, and a reaction against all rebels had begun. Courtenay, 
the new Archbishop, summoned a Court at Blackfriars in May 
1382, to condemn the doctrines which Wycliffe’s followers 
professed, the dangerous heresies in regard to the Eucharist, 
the no less dangerous heresies in regard to the powers and the 
property of priests. The nerves of the Council were shaken 
by an earthquake, and it is significant that Wycliffe personally 
escaped attack. But the Bishops were authorised by the Crown 
to take strong measures against his supporters. All the interests 
which he had alarmed and challenged, seized the opportunity 
and gathered for revenge. Oxford might fight for its freedom 
of discussion. The Secular clergy, the younger men especially, 
might rally to the greatest Schoolman of the day. But the 
ecclesiastical authorities were now masters of the situation, and 
they were determined that the University should submit. 
A curious contest followed. The Archbishop commanded 
the University to suppress the condemned doctrines under pain 
of excommunication, and entrusted his mandate to an old 
opponent of Wycliffe, the Carmelite Doctor Peter Stokes, But 
the Chancellor, Robert Rygge, was now on the Reformer’s side. 
Stokes was afraid to publish his mandate. The Chancellor would 
give him no assistance, and meanwhile Nicholas Hereford and

(30) in regard to Berton’s Chancellorship. There are some grounds for 
putting the Oxford condemnation in 1380—though I think that less likely 
—and some for suggesting 1382. (See Matthew, Eng. Hist. Rev. V, 
328-30, Poole’s Wycliffe, 105, and the articles on Berton and Rygge in

Philip Repington, two of Wycliffe’s strongest adherents, were 
preaching inflammatory sermons in Oxford with the active 
connivance of their friends. Repington was said to have incited 
the people to rise and spoil the churches. The Chancellor, who 
came to hear him, went home laughing at his side. Repington’s 
supporters carried weapons under their gowns, and the Mayor 
supplied the Chancellor with a guard of a hundred men. “‘ Vener- 
able father,’ wrote Stokes to the Archbishop, “I dare go no 
further for fear of death.” The Masters of Arts,1 the Secular 
interests, the University officials, the friends of University 
freedom, even the townsmen, the University’s old rivals, made 
no secret of their sympathy with the Reformer’s cause. 
But the Church, with the Crown behind it, proved too strong. 
The Chancellor, summoned imperiously to Lambeth, was forced to 
beg pardon on his knees. He was only forgiven on the inter- 
cession of William of Wykeham, ever faithful to the University | 
which he beautified and loved. He was compelled to suspend 
Wycliffe and his chief followers from preaching, and to make a 
general inquisition for heretics and their productions at Oxford. 
Most of Wycliffe’s prominent supporters were sooner or later 
made toretract. Hereford and Repington were excommunicated. 
Others like John Aston and Laurence Bedeman, who had been 
Rector of Exeter College, were condemned. At Oxford at any 
rate the Reformers were silenced. Rygge proved unable to 
protect his friends. Hereford set off for Rome, in the vain hope 
of finding there tolerance and understanding, and was thrown 
into a Papal prison. And though he afterwards returned to 
England, raised the Wycliffite standard and faced imprisonment 
again, he finally forsook his old connections, received preferment, 
andendedasamonk. Repington recanted ; he became Bishop of 
Lincoln, a Cardinal, and a terror to the Lollards. Bedeman sub- 
sided into a Devonshire living. John Aston, after a hard fight, 
apologised and “denied the presence of bread.” But his sub- | 
mission may have been only a formality, for before five years 
were over he was preaching his old creed afresh, Even John | 
Purvey, Wycliffe’s companion at Lutterworth, was driven 
some years later to retract. Wycliffe himself, who remained 
to the last strangely unmolested, seems to have abandoned the 
battlefield at Oxford, and to have made no further fight there 
for his opinions.?- He had already withdrawn to Lutterworth. 
1 But not, it seems, the Regents in Theology. 
2 Wycliffe’s alleged recantation is neither proved nor probable. 
Knighton (Chron, II, 156 sq.) hardly establishes the charge. See Arnold’s 
note (Select. Eng. Works of Wyclif, III, 501). Knighton’s statement that 
Wycliffe appeared before a synod at Oxford in November 1382 is im- 
probable. Lechler inclines to accept it (tr. 1878, p. 403), but Rashdall 
and Trevelyan do not.

He had determined to appeal from the wisdom of scholars to 
a wider and less educated world. “An unlearned man with 
God’s grace,” the Oxford Doctor sadly acknowledged, ‘ does 
more for the Church than many graduates.” 1 But though 
exiled from his old home, he flung himself more vigorously than 
ever into his popular campaign. His Latin dialectics may have 
lost their hold on theologians, but his terse, shrewd, forcible 
English still kept its powerful appeal for the people. The 
attempt made by the Crown and the Lords in 1382 to put down 
his itinerant preachers was sharply checked by the House of 
Commons.? His work went on. To the last he busied himself 
with his sermons, his tracts, his great translation, his fearless 
condemnation of ecclesiastical error and abuse. To the last 
he challenged Pope and Bishop, monk and Friar. He denounced 
with all his old force and effectiveness the Crusade preached 
by Urban VI against his rival at Avignon, and the Bishop of 
Norwich’s scandalous campaign on its behalf. But his health 
had already begun to break. Stricken with paralysis on Inno- 
cent’s Day 1384, while hearing Mass in his own church, he failed 
quickly. From that day forward he never spoke again. His 
opponents let him die in peace. Archbishop Arundel indeed 
would have had the “son of the old serpent” dragged from his 
grave and thrown upon a dunghill. But it was not till many 
years later that orthodoxy so far triumphed in its malice as to 
take up his bones and burn them and cast his ashes in the river 
Swift.

fearless a Reformer, and a far greater master of the English 
tongue, declared that the flame which Wycliffe lit in England 
proved ‘‘ but a short blaze soon damped and stifled by the pope 
and prelates.’’* But the judgment of Erasmus that it ‘‘ was 
only overcome and not extinguished” perhaps more nearly 
represents the facts. At Oxford indeed the Bishops’ authority 
triumphed. Royal writs proscribed Wycliffe’s opinions, and 
ordered the banishment of all who preached them. King Richard 
was as vehemently orthodox as the cousin who dethroned him : 
on his tomb at Westminster his boast that ‘‘ he overthrew the 
heretics’”’ can still be traced. In 1397 Archbishop Arundel 
determined to extirpate heresy in Oxford. His own banishment 
for high treason checked his plans. But the revolution which

seated Henry IV on the throne restored the Archbishop’s authority, 
and sealed again the alliance between Church and State. The 
Lollards, who claimed to be half the nation, may have been 
“Jollers’’ or idle fellows. But there was no doubt of their 
resolve to attack Church abuses as well as to “lull” or sing or 
mutter psalms.1. They preached. They read the Bible. They 
lifted up their voices against celibacy. They denounced the 
confessional, pilgrimages, relics, even the unchristian practice 
of war: 
“T know not how charity may stand, 
Where deadly war is taken on hand.” * 
Powerful squires were counted among the Lollards’ protectors. 
Town after town in England was full of their friends. London, 
Leicester, Bristol, the Midlands and the West, became centres 
of Lollardy.*? Oxford, even under repression, was still their 
academic home. The University was no longer ‘“‘ the mother of 
virtues, the lamp of knowledge, the prop of Catholick faith.” In 
r140r an Act with the sinister title De Heretico Comburendo 
sharpened the softer penalties of an earlier day. Persecution 
for heresy was a new fashion in England, a fashion which never 
for long took root among our people. “ Roasting men to 
orthodoxy,” in Jeremy (ollier’s saying, might be permitted 
but was not understood. But Church and State were bent upon 
repression, and both had reasons for’ disquiet. Preachers of 
“ dissembled holiness ’’-were to be sparedno more. Prosecutions 
were instituted. Obstinate heretics ‘‘ damnably thinking of the 
Sacraments” “were burned. Prince Henry himself intervened at 
the pitiful death of John Badby, the tailor of Evesham, in 1410, 
entreating him to confess his errors for life and pardon and three- 
pence a day. The same great King vainly tried to argue Sir 
John Oldcastle out of his beliefs. Orthodox opinion could not 
understand why knight or noble wanted 
‘To bable the Bibel day and’night.”’§

* Especially London and Bristol, says Adam of Usk (Chron., ed. 
Thompson, 3-4 and 141, n.). He speaks of the slaughter of 23,000 
Wycliffites, under the year 1382—a wild statement, even if it is meant 
to include all the Lollards killed before the close of his Chronicle in 1421. 
Dr. Rashdall, while discounting these figures, seems to think that a 
Wycliffite rising was stamped out with’ great slaughter in 1399 (D.N.B., 
vol. lxiii, p. 218). But I do not know of any authority for this beyond 
Adam of Usk’s statement above.

  THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY SCHOOLMEN 237 
Oldcastle’s rising seemed to justify, severities. Persecution lasted, 
and the proscribed opinions lasted too. At Oxford indeed in 
1406 the Chancellor and Masters are alleged to have issued a 
celebrated document—there are good reasons for thinking that 
it was issued under the University seal—extolling Wycliffe in 
terms which the Heads of the Church could never have approved. 
A later Chancellor declared that the University seal had been 
stolen, to send encouragement from heretics in Oxford to heretics 
in Prague. And it is not impossible that a hasty vote of 
Wycliffite Masters in the Long Vacation may have sanctioned a 
demonstration which the University as a whole would have 
condemned.* 
Be that as it may, Archbishop Arundel was himself at Oxford 
shortly afterwards,? holding a provincial Council and over-awing 
rebels. Wycliffe’s Bible was prohibited, together with all trans- 
lations of the Scriptures issued without the leave of the Bishops. 
University teachers were forbidden to teach heretical doctrines 
or to allow discussions about the nature of the Sacraments 
or the essential dogmas of the faith. A monthly inquisition to 
discover heretics was ordered in all Colleges and Halls. The 
offenders were to be suspended and expelled. Unlicensed 
preachers were to be suppressed. A rigid censorship subjected 
books to the approval first of University delegates and secondly 
of the Archbishop himself. Not content with these sweeping 
Constitutions, which struck directly at freedom of discussion, 
the chief source of Oxford’s intellectual life, Arundel, it seems, 
was determined that Wycliffe’s heresies should be condemned 
by the University too, and he demanded the appointment of 
twelve persons to draw up a list of the Reformer’s errors. In 
1 Lyte (279-80) makes this suggestion. But it is not impossible that 
the seal was stolen and misused. (See Wilkins, Concilia, III, 336.) Dr. 
Rashdall (II, 433, n.) seems to suggest that the incident occurred in 1411. 
But 1406 is the date generally accepted. (See Wilkins, III, 302, and 
Wood, Amn. I, 542-3.) On Peter Payne, a devoted Wycliffite, whom 
Gascoigne accused of sharp practice in the matter, see the interesting 
article in D.N.B. 
2 Probably in 1408, towards the end of the year. Dr. Gairdner gives 
both 1408 and 1407. (Compare his article on Arundel, D.N.B., with his 
Lollardy, I, 61.) From the Archbishop’s Register at Lambeth it seems 
clear that Councils were held both at Oxford and at St. Paul’s Cathedral 
(Regist., Arundel, II, 1o%-12»). Wilkins (Conc. III, 314-19) speaks of the 
Constitutions as made in St. Paul’s in January 1408 (Old Style), but adds 
at the end ‘“‘ Datz Oxonii” (the words in the Register are ‘‘ Datt. Oxon.”’) ; 
and he gives in a foot-note authority for the view that the decisions made 
at Oxford were confirmed in London. Dr. Rashdall (II, 432, n.) thinks 
the Constitutions were published both in Oxford and in London. Dr. 
Stubbs (Const. Hist. III, 360) and the Archbishop’s Register (f. 12») which 
Wilkins follows (III, 320), give the date of publication as 1409. But it 
is not easy to be certain about the dates.

  238 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
vain the Oxford Masters raised objections. In vain the majority 
of Faculties in the Great Congregation refused to make the 
appointment of delegates required. In vain, when the Arch- 
bishop at last secured their appointment, John Byrche, a freedom- 
loving Proctor, induced the Masters to cancel it and to carry on 
the fight. In vain the students resisted and rioted and resorted 
to scurrilous songs. In vain the Chancellor who dissolved 
the Congregation was driven to resign. The imperious Arch- 
bishop got his delegates. The delegates after some delay and 
pressure got out their list of heretical propositions, two hundred 
and sixty-seven long. And the books of Wycliffe which gave 
sanction to these errors were burned at Carfax under the 
Chancellor’s eyes. 
But fresh material for controversy was soon forthcoming. 
Arundel determined to assert his claim to visit the University 
officially, in spite of the immunities granted by the Pope.? In 
I41I he summoned the Masters to meet him at St. Mary’s, and 
the Chancellor Richard Courtenay, backed or instigated by the 
Proctors, refused. An issue dearer than any heresy of Wycliffe’s, 
the independence of the University, was at stake. John Byrche 
and Brent his colleague fortified the Church against the Arch- 
bishop. They declined to allow him to enter Oxford as Visitor, 
and when he launched an Interdict against them, they defied his 
authority and celebrated Mass. Armed scholars, only too glad 
of the pretext, poured into the streets and forced the Primate’s 
followers to withdraw.* Arts students and Seculars, Northerners 
and Southerners, lovers of privilege and turbulence and indepen- 
dence, even Oriel Fellows with a taste for roystering,‘ joined in. 
1 The report of the twelve delegates is referred to in letters from the 
University, the Archbishop and the King. (See Wilkins, III, 339 sq. 
and 350-1, and Cotton MS. Faustina, C. VII, 171° sq.) It was probably 
presented before December 1409 (Lyte, 283, n.). Wilkins gives the 
report twice, once under 1382, which must be a wrong date, and once 
with the conclusions in full under 1412 (III, 171 sq. and 339 sq.). See 
also Arundel’s Register at Lambeth (II, 126-127), Cotton MS, Faustina, 
C. VII (134, 135 and 160°), and Twyne (II, 229). Some of the erroneous 
propositions were, it seems, again examined and condemned, in Oxford 
in June 1410 and in London in March rrr. ° (See Lyte, 283-4 and 
Univ. Arch. Reg. C, 123*-125». See also MS. Bodl. 282, 109? sq.) 
2The Bull of Boniface IX, in 1395, which exempted the University 
from all episcopal jurisdiction, had roused strong opposition, even at 
Oxford, which was encouraged by Arundel and supported by the King. 
It was revoked by John XXII in November 1411. (See Lyte, 292-5.) 
® Twyne records the Archbishop’s anger (KXIV, 122 sq.). 
«The record of the Archbishop’s Visitation in Oriel College Treasury 
has been used by Dr. Rashdall and Sir H. M. Lyte. Thomas Wilton was 
one of the most active and determined rebels, and Northern feeling— 
Wilton was a conspicuous Northerner—probably contributed to Wycliffe’s 
support. (See later, p. 260.) But the opposition to Arundel had in many 
cases very little to do with theology.
-P-A-G-E-270
  THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY SCHOOLMEN 239 
In September 1411 the King summoned Chancellor and Proctors 
to London and required their resignation. The King’s Council, 
Parliament, and subsequently the Pope himself, set aside the 
Bull which exempted the University from the Archbishop’s 
jurisdiction. The Masters were called on to elect a new Chancellor 
and new Proctors. But uncowed and impenitent they re-elected 
the old ones instead.1 Prince Henry had to be called in to 
mediate and to avert the Royal anger. In the end the Arch- 
bishop’s right of visitation was acknowledged. The University’s 
opposition was suppressed. And with the triumph of ecclesiastical 
authority the independent spirit of the Oxford Schoolmen and 
the interest, no doubt, of their teaching declined. 
But the liberty which Arundel had struck at did not disap- 
pear. Wycliffe’s books “lay hid.’ ? But his Wicket, a popular 
tract against Transubstantiation, found readers all through the 
fifteenth century in England. Even in Oxford Colleges his 
books were bought. English Lollards carried them North over 
the Border. Scottish Lollards, dim ancestors perhaps of 
Cameronian martyrs, sprang up to study them in Ayrshire and 
the West. As late as 1523, on the eve of a greater Reformation, 
Bishop Tunstall complained to Erasmus of “‘ the great band of 
Wycliffite heretics.’ 4 The Oxford Reformer’s memory was 
never forgotten in his own country. His doctrines found a new 
celebrity and force abroad. Jerome of Prague brought back 
Wycliffe’s books from England to the proud little Slavonic 
kingdom which had given a Queen to Richard II. Bohemian 
pilgrims came to Lutterworth, made transcripts of his writings, 
1 References to the King’s intervention and the struggle over Richard 
Courtenay’s re-election to the Chancellorship will be found in Cotton MS. 
Faustina, C. VII (129-130%, 165°-167%, and 171). 
2 Not only was Arundel’s Visitation carried through, but early in 
1414—not 1413—Repington, now Bishop of Lincoln, announced his inten- 
tion of enquiring into heresy in the University, and was met by no protest. 
The Chancellor’s reply is interesting as giving a list of resident graduates, 
over sixty altogether, including twelve Regent and eighteen Non-Regent 
Masters, and nine Doctors of Divinity, of whom three were Friars and 
three were monks (Twyne, II, 13-14). But the list may be incomplete. 
(See Lyte, 295-6 and Rashdall, II, 436, n.) But it is not clear that 
Arundel’s Visitation had all the results which he desired. About 1435 
we find the Pope calling on the King to suppress heresy in the University, 
as the Archbishop, the Bishop of Lincoln and the Chancellor and Proctors 
are apathetic in the matter, and the King deprecating this serious view 
(B.M. Royal MS. 10, B. IX, 183» and 184). For the King’s action in 
1411, repudiating the exemption from ecclesiastical jurisdiction granted 
by Boniface IX, see Cal. Pap. Letts. (VI, 302-4), Cott. MS. Faust. C. VII 
(1314 sq.), and Shadwell (Enactments in Parliament, 1, 7-14).

CHAPTER VII 
THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 
EXETER, ORIEL, QUEEN’S, NEW COLLEGE AND 
: CANTERBURY 
ETWEEN the days of Duns Scotus and the death of 
Wycliffe several new Colleges were founded in Oxford, one 
of which, crowned with the beauty of five centuries, still 
retains that simplename. Walter of Stapeldon, Bishop of Exeter, 
was a loyal Devonian and an Oxford Canonist of repute.t He 
played a great part as churchman and statesman in the difficult 
days of Edward II. As he rose in the world, he gave generously 
to public purposes the wealth which he acquired. He spent 
lavishly in rebuilding his Cathedral. He left funds for founding 
grammar-schools at Exeter and Ashburton, to train boys for 
University life. He made many bequests to help poor scholars. 
He collected a fine library at his London house near Temple 
Bar, which “the giddy multitude’ incontinently sacked. He 
proved a faithful Minister to an unhappy King, and when his 
master fell he paid the penalty, and was seized by the mob and 
beheaded in Cheapside. But in 1314, in the days of his greatness, 
he devoted certain small revenues in Cornwall to establishing in 
Oxford a Hall for students from the West Country which he 
loved.?_ As the years went on, other property was added, and 
within the Bishop’s lifetime the little community was well launched 
on its career. 
At ‘Stapeldonhalle”” there were to be twelve ordinary 
Scholars or Fellows on the foundation, eight from Devonshire 
and four from Cornwall. They were to be Arts students studying 
philosophy, and were to qualify by a good general education for 
work in Church or State. The Bishop’s sympathies evidently 
lay with the Seculars rather than the monks. One additional 
1 Dean Rashdall (II, 491) thinks that he may have studied at Bologna 
or some Southern University, and points out that to some extent Exeter 
at first represented, like Balliol, the early, simple type of College found in 
Paris. 
2 Apparently his brother, Sir Richard Stapeldon, joined in the gift. 
Their plans began in 1312. The original statutes are dated 24 April, 1316. 
But the Bishop bought Hart Hall and Arthur Hall, for the purposes of 
his College, in 1314, and the King’s license dates from that year.

Scholar only; appointed by the Dean and Chapter of Exeter, 
was to study Theology or Canon Law, and to serve the College 
as Chaplain. The first home of these Scholars in Oxford was 
near Smith Gate, where they occupied two little houses which 
the Bishop had bought, Hart Hall and Arthur Hall beside it, 
on the site of the Hertford College of the future But from there 
they were very soon moved to larger quarters further West. 
Hart Hall was let to other students and the rent applied to the 
maintenance of the new House. In the North part of the parish 
of St. Mildred, between the North wall of the town and the 
lane to which Brasenose was to give its name, the Bishop acquired 
new possessions, partly by purchase and partly by gift from a 
West country friend—St. Stephen’s Hall, ‘an ancient place 
consecrated to learning,” two other little properties rented from 
the Abbess of Godstow, and other tenements in Oxford later on. 
In 1322 he added to the College endowments the Rectory of 
Long Wittenham on the slopes of Sinodun Hill. And presently 
further purchases in Oxford, Fragnon Hall, where the Bodleian 
now interposes, Sheld Hall and Culverd Hall and others on the 
West, Scot Hall and Bedford Hall and others to the South, 
made the Fellows masters, as the fourteenth century proceeded, 
of most of the ground between the North end of Schools Street 
and “the Turl.’ + About 1404 an entrance from Turl Street 
was made by Bishop Stafford, but the West gate and the West 
front were not built for another two hundred years. The chief 
entrance to the College was at first on the North. There in 
1Mr. C. W. Boase gives a plan of these sites (Pl. iv) in his Registrum 
Collegii Exoniensis (ed. 1894), which, with its great store of details and 
its list of Commoners (Part II), is invaluable for the history of the College. 
The earlier edition of 1879 contains some important Latin documents. 
Mr. W. K. Stride’s more recent College history also gives a useful list of 
the MS. and other authorities on the subject. I am constantly indebted 
to both writers. The Second Report of the Hist. MSS. Comm. (127-30) 
should be consulted. Of College documents, which the Rector kindly 
allowed me to examine, the most interesting are the Computi Rectoris 
from the earliest years—a folio volume running from 1566 to 1639 is in 
the Rector’s keeping—the Bursars’ Books and Caution Books, both dating 
from the early years of the seventeenth century, and above all the College 
Registers, the two earliest volumes of which run from 1539 to 1619 and 
from 1619 to 1737. A seventeenth-century volume dated 1631 contains 
transcripts of important Elizabethan documents and of some early deeds 
and charters. The handsome Book of Benefactors dates from the beginning 
of the eighteenth century. There is more than one copy of the early 
Statutes, but the originals are not forthcoming. Wood of course has a 
notice of the College history in his Colleges, and notes on the site (City, I, 
113 sq.): but these latter must not be too implicitly accepted. Nor do 
Mr. Boase’s conjectures (360 sq.) dispose of all the difficulties in regard to 
site and buildings. ‘‘ The Turl”’ was known by that name about 1590, 
but had probably no regular name before that (Salter, Historic Names of 
Streets of Oxford, 18).
-P-A-G-E-274
  THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES = 243 
1432 William Palmer, the Rector, once a schoolboy of Launceston, 
built a tower and gateway opening into the lane under the town 
wall.1_ And there, though later builders have swept away so 
many old memorials, Palmer’s Tower substantially survives. 
The Scholars of Stapeldon Hall were poor men, chosen for 
their poverty, their aptitude and conduct. They received ten- 
pence a week for Commons. They received also clothes, rooms 
and ten shillings a year. But their clothes or liveries were 
expected to last for three years. The Rector and the priest were 
given twenty shillings each. The servants’ wages were on the 
same unambitious scale—five shillings a term for the manciple, 
one for the barber and two for the cook. They were a young 
community. They retained their Fellowships only till they had 
qualified and lectured as Masters in Arts, that is, allowing ample 
time for all the processes, for thirteen or fourteen years at the out- 
side.2. They lost them if they succeeded to benefices or acquired 
an income of sixty shillings a year, or if they stayed away five 
months out of the twelve, or refused to take the office of Rector. 
The Rector must have been a young man—his post apparently 
was not greatly in demand—and by an unusually democratic 
arrangement he was elected or re-elected yearly by the Fellows. 
He kept the keys and the purse. He ruled the College and 
managed its business. He lived at first in rooms over the main 
gate. He and his colleagues had certain funds allowed them, 
for seeing to the College property, for visits and festivities, for 
long journeys down to Devonshire, for payments to the Exeter 
carrier, who sometimes brought up presents from the West. 
There were curious old customs, still surviving in the sixteenth 
century,’ in which the boots and clothing of the Fellows played 
a prominent part. They must not wear shirts “ with lappets 
hanging down like promontories,” nor courtiers’ plaits about the 
neck. Bachelors must have long gowns reaching to the knees. 
They must come early to matins and vespers before the bell 
stopped. They must not be too familiar with Masters, but 
must respect their high degree. Scholars, who were not Bachelors, 
were to walk about “within the Academy” with uncovered 
1This lane bore different names at different dates and in different 
parts—e.g. Somnore Lane, the King’s Way, and Exeter Lane. Rector’s 
Row, afterwards called Chapel Row, dated from the same year. It was 
a block of buildings, East and West of the tower, facing Somnore Lane. 
The West part became the Rector’s Lodgings. 
2 The Statutes contemplated a student taking possibly six years for 
B.A., four or five more for M.A., two for lectures as Necessary Regent, and 
one final year before his Fellowship ceased. (Boase, Ev. Regist., 1894, 
xxxi-ii.) It was a liberal calculation.

heads. All Scholars were expected to attend lectures and to 
hold constant disputations. They must eschew noisiness and 
idle stories and bad manners in the House of God. They must 
abstain from pilfering at the buttery. ° They must feed those in 
prison once a week. It was a homely and simple little community, 
with no dangerous temptations to luxury or wealth.t The Bishop 
of Exeter watched over its welfare, interfered in its quarrels, 
and insisted on its rules. He also protested sharply if the 
Fellows filled up a vacancy with a scholar from the diocese of 
Salisbury. The name of Exeter College gradually displaced the 
old name of the Founder, and early in the fifteenth century the 
Pope confirmed the change. In 1384 Bishop Brantingham 
ordered the rule for the annual election of the Rector to be 
altered: the office was to be continuous so long as its holder 
was not proved to be negligent or unfit,? “ Statutes, like their 
makers,” said the Bishop pithily and wisely, ‘‘ require change, 
as experience shows.’’? co 
The College buildings grew up gradually, and in very early 
days the Chapel was begun. The Rector of St. Mildred’s Church? 
required an assurance that it should not prejudice his rights. 
In 1321 a license to build the Chapel was granted, and in 1326, 
in the last year of his greatness, Bishop Stapeldon had leave 
to consecrate the high altar. “It -stood to the South-east of 
the spot where Palmer’s tower was afterwards to rise. It was 
raised above the ground, with chambers under it, and the Fellows 
sat near the door. Old fourteenth-century records remain of 
purchases of wine and incense and wax-candles, of payments 
for repairs and other charges—eight pence for a workman who 
mended the windows, two pence for breakfast for a priest and 
singing clerk, sixteen pence for an iron chain to secure a book 
1In 1535-6 the Valor Ecclesiasticus estimates the College revenues at 
only £83 2s. Elizabethan endowments‘are said to have brought them up to 
£600 before that century closed (Boasé) Ex.“Regist., lxxvi and xcvi). 
But this must be an over-statementy £200 or a little less would probably 
be nearer the mark (Stride, Exeter College, 43): 
? Boase (Ex. Regist. Ix). But it seems doubtful how far the order 
took effect, for in 1566 John Neale was chosen as Perpetual Rector, after 
having been apparently elected Rector in six successive years (Ib. 68 and 
Stride, 47, n.). 
* The earliest existing copy of the Statutes, long after Stapeldon’s day, 
was used for the text printed in 1855; but they were not included in the 
Statutes of the Colleges issued by the Commission. They were printed 
again by Prebendary Hingeston-Randolph in-his Register of Walter de 
Stapeldon Bishop of Exeter (303-10). 
4St. Mildred’s Church is rightly placed by Mr. Boase (Ex. Regist., 
Plate IV) South of Brasenose Lane, on the site of part of Lincoln College. 
Mr. Boase’s Register is full of valuable details in regard to the College 
buildings, and Mr. Stride’s volume of 1900 has a special chapter on that 
subject (Ch. VII) from the late Rector’s pen.

by Rabanus, three half-pence for a cord for the Chapel bell. 
Early in the fifteenth century Bishop Stafford of Exeter, besides 
other generous benefactions, gave a chalice and books for divine 
service, and re-built the porch and covered it with lead. Later 
on fresh benefactors, William Palmer and John Westlake, 
presented windows which Wood has described. This Chapel 
lasted for three hundred years. But in 1624 another Chapel 
was built further to the West, and George Hakewill, Fellow and 
Rector, although he had “‘ two sonnes of his own to be provided 
for,” contributed twelve hundred pounds towards its cost. 
The old Chapel was turned into a Library and lingered on for 
some generations. Its successor, a double Chapel notable for 
its fine arched roof and paintings, and for the ‘‘ three little white 
stones ’’ commemorating the children of Dr. Prideaux, the great 
Rector of his day,t has now given place in turn to a third building 
designed upon a more ambitious scale,? and the masonry hewn 
in the seventeenth century has gone to fill up the deep foundations 
rendered necessary by the nearness of the old town ditch. 
Exeter had a very early College Library, which, Wood tells 
us, fell into ruin in the reign of Edward III. There are records 
of contributions to it in the fourteenth century by Bishop 
Grandison, Bishop Brantingham and Bishop Rede.? In 1375 
three shillings and fourpence were paid for thatching its roof. 
But about 1383 a new Library was built, at right-angles to the 
old Chapel, ‘‘on the East side,” says Wood, ‘“‘of the upper 
Court that now is.’ Homely little details of the building 
charges—payments for stone, for timber, and for workmen’s 
wages, for cheese for labourers, for breakfast for the white- 
washers—are preserved in the records of the College. This 
building, enlarged by Bishop Stafford, continued in use for some 
two centuries and a half. But in 1624 or 1625 the books were 
moved to the old Chapel, where they nearly suffered destruction 
from a fire in 1709. The College authorities had overlooked the 
danger of keeping a ‘‘ Hole for Ashes” beside the main room 
where their manuscripts were stored. The eighteenth century 
1 They were baptised, it seems, in St. Michael’s Church, not buried 
there, as Mr. Boase (89) suggests. (See Peshall, Antient and Present State 
of the City of Oxford (27)). Mr. Vallance (Old Colleges, 26) gives an interest- 
ing picture of Hakewill’s Chapel. 
2 About 1859. Sir Gilbert Scott’s, Chapel was once described by Prof. 
Freeman as one of “‘ the most glorious” buildings in modern England 
(Proceedings of Oxford Architectural Soc., N.S., 1, 171-2). Others have been 
more impressed by its disproportion to the buildings round it and the 
space at its command. But its history belongs to a later day. 
3 William Rede, Bishop of Chichester, 1368-85, a very good friend to 
Merton, found means to benefit other Colleges too. He must not be 
confounded with Robert Reade the era who was Bishop of 
Chichester, 1397-1415.

was to provide another Library, and the nineteenth century 
another building yet, looking down on the great chestnut which 
bends its boughs to touch the College opposite whenever Brase- 
nose has to yield to Exeter upon the river.1 Among the early 
treasures of the College are included, besides the Tullys and 
Aristotles and Schoolmen, the Bibles and Service Books of bygone 
days, two copies of Tyndale’s New Testament, two rare volumes 
printed at Tavistock in the reign of Henry VIII, and a famous 
Psalter dating back to Cregy, which became the family Bible of 
the Tudor Queens, and which is still. our sole authority for the 
date of the birth of “the noble king Harry the vii.” 2 
Many other buildings are mentioned in the College documents. 
Dr. Prideaux’s survey, taken in 1631, gives some interesting 
details. A Hall was built in the fourteenth century, not far 
from the North gate, West of the old Library, and running 
South, more or less parallel with it.3 It was “ half-covered” 
by Bishop Stafford, who succeeded to his diocese before that 
century closed. Stafford proved a generous patron to the 
College—he has been called its second Founder—and he spent 
over two hundred marks upon its buildings. When the Hall 
got the rest of its roofing is not so clear. But there are early 
notices of charges for its upkeep, for table-cloths and napkins, 
for towels for the wash-basin, for candles and torches, for tankards 
and spoons. The original kitchen stood near it, and also the 
new one built soon after 1483.4 The old Hall could never 
“conveniently intertayne the Company,” but it seems to have 
served the College until 1618, when Sir John Acland, as became 
a West country magnate, gave eight hundred pounds for a new 
one, with a great beer cellar underneath. With its open roof 
and its louvre it is conspicuous in Loggan’s plan. The kitchen 
was left standing ‘‘ in the midst of the College very disgracefully ” 
until 1632, and we hear of blind streets and ugly corners in the 
College precincts, “full of Bones Filth and Nettles.’’ Before 
Henry VIII’s death a little block of buildings sprang up at the 
South-west corner where Turl Street joins Brasenose Lane. 
Fifty or sixty years later, in 1597, Bentley’s Nest was built 
over the fourteenth-century Library, timber buildings, ‘‘ wooden

3 It can be seen in Agas’ view, and is just visible in Bereblock’s. In 
Loggan’s it has disappeared. (Mr. Boase gives, Pl. III, an enlarged 
copy of Agas’ view.) 
4 We are told that John Phylypp (Rector, 1464-70) gave money for 
it in that year (Jb. 42). He is also said to have subscribed to a new Hall. 
But Wood is surely right in thinking that the fourteenth-century Hall 
lasted till 1618 (Colleges, 112).

Stuffe,”’ more picturesque perhaps than commodious to live in. 
But on the other hand the “ Firmnesse and Magnificence”’ of 
Periam’s Mansions, which adjoined it,! set in the seventeenth 
century a new standard for the College rooms. John Periam, 
the son of an Exeter merchant, and brother-in-law of the lady 
whose benefits Balliol recalls, proved a worthy benefactor. 
“God rayse us,” prays a grateful chronicler, ‘‘ many such to 
follow his example.” He was connected with Dr. Prideaux, 
the famous Rector, who left behind him buildings of his own. 
The reign of James I saw important changes. In 1605 a 
West gate with a tower over it appeared upon the Turl: and 
in 1671 a fine block of buildings North of this tower was added. 
In James I’s day also Somnore Lane was closed—thanks to the 
influence with a Scottish King of a Scottish nobleman—‘ the 
now Marquesse of Hamilton, some tymes student of our Colledg ” ; 
and fresh space was thus given for the extension of the College 
to the North. Alderman Wright of Oxford built a house on or 
near the City wall. This passed to the College, and before many 
years were over Dr. Prideaux is said to have added a third storey 
to this building and to have given it his own name.? By the end 
of the seventeenth century, while some of the older buildings 
had decayed or vanished, the main quadrangle had grown up. 
Acland’s Hall was on the South side towards Brasenose Lane. 
Hakewill’s Chapel was on the North side, and the Jacobean 
gateway and other buildings on the West. Dr. Prideaux in his 
Survey gives many details of the Rector’s Lodgings, between 
the Chapel and Palmer’s tower, beginning with the cellar and 
describing all the rooms, the ‘“‘ Waynescote Parler,”’ the Rector’s 
Bedchamber, the “‘ Waynscoted great dyning Roome,” the hall 
and several ‘‘ Studyes,’”’ up to the Treasury, reserved for the use 
of the College, and the Cock-loft at the top.? He speaks also 
of the outbuildings lying in the space between the North front 
and the old town ditch, of the Tower house once standing in 
boggy ground “ between the butts,” of the stable built by Dr. 
Holland, and converted apparently into rooms by Dr. Prideaux, 
of the three little gardens “‘ without the Rector’s Back side, 
ranging along by the Cittye Wall.” We hear of a Mount with 
a dial on it, of a Bowling Alley, afterwards included in the Rector’s 
garden, of an ancient tennis-court and of an ancient conduit, 
1 In the South-east corner of the quadrangle, next to Acland’s Hall. 
27 cannot find this in Loggan’s view: Mr. Stride’s history speaks of 
it (194) as hidden by the Chapel. But Mr. Boase’s plans (Pl. IV and 
p. 360) seem to place it further North, and in that case it ought to show 
in Loggan’s picture. (See also Stride, 182 and 190.) 
3 For Dr. Prideaux’s Survey of December 1631, see Boase (Regist. 
311-20). Both Prideaux, after the date of this Survey, and Dr. Bury in 
1671 added materially to the Rector’s Lodgings.

248 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
which once brought water down from Carfax to a cistern near the 
Chapel door. But most of these old memorials were destined to 
vanish with the sweeping, heedless changes of succeeding years.! 
In early days Stapeldon’s Scholars had their troubles, poverty 
and pestilence, misgovernment and discord. After the Black 
Death came the Wycliffite movement : the Exeter Fellows gave 
it strong support. Robert Rygge, the Chancellor who played 
so large a part in the great controversy, Thomas de Brightwell, 
who suffered at the hands of Archbishop Courtenay, and Laurence 
Bedeman or Stevine, Rector in 1379-80, whose ‘‘ fox-like craft ’’ 
Bishop Brantingham denounced, were all conspicuous members of 
the College. Benedict Brent, Fellow and Proctor, though not 
apparently a Lollard, was as bold as John Byrche in resisting 
Archbishop Arundel’s encroachments, and was sent to the Tower 
for his audacity.?. But at Oriel, Queen’s and Merton the Wycliffite 
Fellows of Exeter found friends. Among political personages 
Robert Tresilian, Chief Justice in 1381, was a member of the 
College. Prominent among Richard II’s supporters, he shared 
the fate of other advisers of that unhappy King. But under 
the House of Lancaster many Exeter men found prosperity. 
Two, it is said, were with Henry V at Agincourt. One, Michael 
de Tregury, was afterwards Rector ofthe new University set up 
at Caen. He lived to be Archbishop of Dublin, where Swift 
long after discovered his tomb. Two others were respectively 
physician and confessor to Henry VI. William Palmer, builder 
of the first College tower, was physician apparently to King 
Henry’s Queen. Walter Lyhert,-a miller’s son from Lanteglos 
by Fowey,? became Provost of Oriel, and was afterwards 
famous both as Bishop and as builder. . St. Mary’s owed 
its new Chancel to him, when its old walls failed. Sir John 
Fortescue accompanied Queen Margaret in her exile, and 
wrote on the laws of England for her ill-fated son. Another 
Fellow found his way to Jerusalem and celebrated Mass there in 
1462. From Henry V and Cardinal Beaufort legacies came to 
the College. Later on, William Grocyn, returning from Florence, 
taught Greek in the old Hall. Colet was entertained there. 
Servants of Wolsey’s were probably among its members. Henry 
VIII enforced his views upon it. But the Catholics of the West, 
who protested against the violence of the Reformation, found 
1 The information collected by Mr. Boase is well worth study—though 
there are still points on which it is difficult to be exact. 
2 He was elected Rector shortly afterwards. Middleworth (see pp. 223 
and 274) was not the only Exeter man who passed on to Queen’s, and who 
was associated with Wycliffe and his opinions. But all Exeter men were 
not on that side.

sympathisers within its walls. John Moreman, the well-known 
Vicar of Menheniot, whom Edward VI’s Council sent to the 
Tower, and whose cause the Cornish insurgents defended, was a 
member of Exeter and had been Principal of Hart Hall.1_ Even 
under Elizabeth Catholic influences persisted. John Neale, the 
first ‘‘ perpetual” Rector, was ejected in 1570 for refusing to 
conform. All but four members of the College were said to 
be “‘ secret or open Roman affectionaries.’’ Exeter men swelled 
the ranks of the Jesuits, and helped to found the College at 
Douai, even to supply a conspirator for the Gunpowder Plot. 
The old order in Oxford did not die without a struggle, and the 
old order has often found defenders in the West. 
But with Elizabeth, who had Stapeldon blood in her veins, 
a new order began. Rectors with new views were appointed. 
Exeter men were conspicuous when the Queen visited Oxford ; 
and in 1566, on her first visit, John Bereblock, the Dean, prepared 
for her a set of valuable drawings of the Colleges of that day. 
“Far from the Oxford schools lies Exeter 
Hard by the western ocean’s distant marge, 
Yet next the Oxford schools there waits for her 
A nook secluded in the Muses’ charge. 
*Twas Bishop Stapeldon, rememb’ring whence he came, 
Founded this Devon house and called it by his name.” 
And under Elizabeth a veteran Tudor statesman founded afresh 
the prosperity of the College. Sir William Petre was as successful 
as his great contemporary Cecil in retaining office in revolutionary 
times. The son of a wealthy Devonshire tanner, he studied at 
Exeter, became a Fellow of All Souls and tutor to the half- 
brother of Anne Boleyn. Introduced at Court, he won the favour 
of Cromwell, and worked hard and profitably at putting the 
monasteries down. He became a Secretary of State under 
Henry VIII. He was equally prominent under Somerset and 
under Somerset’s supplanters. He helped to arrange the 
succession of Lady Jane Grey. He lost no time in declaring 
for Queen Mary. He joined in welcoming Cardinal Pole to 
England, but he induced the Pope to confirm him in his own 
monastic spoils. At the right moment he became the servant 
of Elizabeth, and he died full of possessions and honours. An

the beginning of the earliest College Register, and some entries smudged 
and deleted in 1547 may refer to theological troubles. 
2T. Neale, the Hebrew Reader, wrote Latin verses to describe Bere- 
block’s drawings. The verses on Exeter, put into the mouth of Lord 
Leicester, the Chancellor, are translated in Mr. Stride’s book (48-9). 
T. Neale must not be confused with John Neale, the Rector first elected 
in 1560 and ejected ten years later.

  250 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
able, moderate, far-sighted man, “of approved wisdom and 
exquisite learning,’ with no cast-iron political principles, and 
yet, says Strype, “ without spot that I could find except change 
ofj religion,’ Petre had perhaps some reason for bewailing to 
Cecil that men went fishing in the world “for gain and wicked 
mammon.” He seems to have clung to the old Church. He 
certainly clung to many of her possessions. But at least as 
regards his old College he used his wealth both generously and 
well. He bought Rectories and lands from the Queen and 
bestowed them on his old Society. He more than doubled the 
revenues of the College. Eight new Fellowships were founded, 
for students drawn from the many counties in which the Petre 
family had property. In March 1566 the Queen granted the 
College a charter of incorporation, and empowered the Bishop 
of Exeter, as Visitor, to draw up new Statutes with Petre’s 
assent. 
The Elizabethan Statutes date from a new age, but they 
recall many customs long familiar? The Rector, a Master of 
Arts, was to live on the spot, and to be at least thirty years old. 
A Sub-Rector and Dean were appointed to assist him. His 
permanence and dignity, if not his affluence, were now assured. 
The old practice of disputation was re-affirmed and encouraged. 
Logic lectures were to begin at six in the morning, logic disputa- 
tions to follow for, two hours every day. The time was to be 
reckoned by a water-clock. Philosophers and theologians had 
of course their disputations also. Fellows elected before taking 
their Bachelor’s degree were not to take it till three years after 
their election. Masters of Arts, after completing their necessary 
Regency, were to have ten years for the Bachelor’s degree in 
Divinity and to take their Doctorate in eight years more.‘ 
Independent means, of small amount, preferment of a certain 
value, marriage or non-residence, vacated a Fellowship. One 
Fellow was allowed with wise liberality later to travel abroad 
for four years to study Physic or Civil Law. Commons were 
fixed at twelve pence a week and eighteen pence for weeks of 
festival. The Rector had twenty shillings for stipend, the 
Chaplain twenty-six shillings and eight pence, the Fellows ten

Reni), 
. . a the South and East of England. This helped to break down the 
West Country and Catholic tradition. 
3 Mr. Boase (Ixxxix sg.) gives many details. Petre’s Statutes were 
partly based on those of Trinity. But I should hesitate to say with Mr. 
Stride (43) that either Petre’s or Sir Thomas Pope’s “ show the influence 
of the new learning and the new faith in almost every line.”

his D.D.

shillings each.1 The Dean was paid for presenting men for 
degrees, and received eight pence a quarter from the Commoners 
and Battelers who attended his lectures on logic. Dress was 
regulated, gambling and unruly sports prohibited—though cards 
were allowed on certain festal days. Dogs, ferrets, rabbits, 
hawks, were all proscribed. The Bible was to be read during 
meals in Hall; after that conversation in a learned language 
was permitted. Gates were to be locked at a quarter past nine 
at night; and the keys carried to the Rector’s bed-room. There 
were rules for dealing with the College property, for limiting the 
length of leases, for the guidance of the Visitor; for removing a 
Rector or a Fellow. The Statutes were to be read aloud twice a 
year in the Chapel, and any Fellow lost a fortnight’s commons if 
on those occasions he stayed away. One of Petre’s objects was, 
no doubt, to remind the Fellows of a discipline which the course 
of many generations had relaxed. 
Several of the new Fellows nominated by Sir William Petre, 
“unnaturall sons,’ as a later Rector called them; became 
Romanist missionaries in England or abroad. But by the end 
of the century Protestant influences, supported in high quarters, 
had triumphed. Thomas Glasier from Christ Church was 
appointed Rector, on the strong recommendation of Sir John 
Petre, in 1578, and by the same influence, backed perhaps by 
Royal pressure, Thomas Holland, who had been connected with 
Oriel and Balliol, was brought in in 1592.2 Holland, already 
Regius Professor of Divinity, was ‘‘an Apollos mighty in the 
Scriptures,’ afterwards one of the translators of the Bible, and 
he had grown up in the new ideas. These able rulers re-organised 
the College. In the seventeenth century it was one of the most 
important in Oxford. Holland was credited with training 
““many famous bishops and doctors,” and there was no lack of 
great West Country names. Sir John Eliot matriculated at 
Exeter in 1607. Pym, a little earlier, had an Exeter man for 
his tutor, though he went to Broadgates Hall himself. It is 
worth note that Eliot, Pym and Hampden all went up to Oxford 
at fifteen. Edward Hyde tried in vain for a Fellowship at 
Exeter. William ‘Noye, of Ship-Money fame, ‘‘ Attornatus 
Domini Regis ’’—which he translated only too aptly as “ one 
that must serve the King’s turn ’”’—and William Strode, one of

each ; and in 1592 the Rectorship is said to have been worth £70 (Boase, 
Ixxvi and xcvi). In 1649, on the other hand, it was valued at only 
445, (Ib. cxxii). 
Holland had been Exhibitioner of Oriel and Chaplain and Reader

Mercer, had resigned his claim (Boase, 83-4).

the Five Members, were both educated in the College. So, if 
he be the gentleman’s son from Devonshire who matriculated in 
March 1601,1 was John Ford, not the least illustrious of the 
dramatists of his day. And so were many other notable West 
Country men ?—Grenvilles and Arundels, Champernownes and 
Carews—who, when the war came, held by the King. Sir Bevil 
Grenville showed himself in arms not unworthy of the ancestry 
behind him: 
“Thy grandsire fills the seas and thou the land.” 
But at Oxford, as he told his son, he ‘‘ fell upon the sweet delights 
of reading poetry and history,” and he found himself “ infinitely 
defective’ afterwards in his knowledge of other things. His 
son, unhappily, took no warning, and was content to be a loyal 
but unlettered Dean. 
In 1612 the College numbered over two hundred members,? 
including a long list of Commoners besides servitors and poor 
scholars. John Prideaux was elected Rector in that year. He 
was the son of a humble Devonshire yeoman, and had travelled 
up to Oxford in a pair of leather breeches which, tradition said, 
he kept beside his rochet in later days. -He had entered the 
College as a “ Scoutsboy”’ in 1596, and may have joined the 
labours of a scullion to the studies of a scholar. Chaplain in 
turn to James and Charles, he proved as loyal as any man to 
the rights of Kings. But he could not believe in the divine right 
of Bishops, and he differed widely from Laud’s opinions though 
he won and kept the Archbishop’s respect. His independence 
did not prevent King Charles from making him a Bishop. He 
1See Register of University (ed. Clark, II, ii, 246). 
2 But Prideaux drew students from all over England, from Scotland 
and from the Continent too. 
3 Mr. Stride says (54) that 206 names were on the books: and Twyne 
(MS. XXI, 513) puts the number of students at 188, in the estimate 
of students in Colleges and Halls which the Vice-Chancellor rendered to 
Prince Henry in August 1611. Exeter in that list ranks third, its numbers 
being exceeded only by Christ Church (214) and Magdalen (211). But 
servants here are not mentioned. Twyne’s list of 1612 gives Exeter 134 
Commoners, and makes the total higher. 
4 There were also at times Fellow Commoners, rich men who dined at 
the Fellows’ table, and Battallers or Battelers—it is spelt in more ways 
than one—who ranked below the Commoners but above the Servitors. 
They were distinguished by different scales for caution-money, rent and 
commons (Boase, xcvii—viii). Mr. Boase’s guess that the word battels 
means ‘‘ little bats,’’i.e. the tallies or notched sticks on which the accounts 
were kept, is not supported by Dr. Murray (New Eng. Dict.), but is 
worth consideration. De Quincey’s derivation (Autobiography, II, 47) 
from ‘‘the old monkish”’ paella a plate, is also ingenious. But I think 
battels in old English simply meant food.

  THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES = 253 
left the University as the Civil War broke out, and shared in 
the ruin which fell on many loyal Churchmen. His income and 
supplies ran short. He laughingly complained that he had too 
great a stomach: he had to eat up his plate, his library, his 
linen and his pewter. He died in poverty at Bredon, a refugee 
in the diocese over which he had ruled. But before misfortune 
came he had made his College a power in Oxford, and a leading 
force in the Calvinist party which ruled the University before 
the ascendency of Laud. While Prideaux was Rector, King 
Charles visited Oxford, and founded certain Channel Island Fellow- 
ships to be held at Exeter and elsewhere. The Calvinists of 
Jersey and Guernsey, it seems, required some training in Anglican 
ideas. George Hakewill, a well-known Fellow, disputant and 
orator, and the builder of the seventeenth-century Chapel, 
succeeded Prideaux as Rector in 1642. But he spent most of 
his Rectorship in exile from Oxford, and the death of his Sovereign 
broke his heart. _Hakewill had already had a sharp experience 
of politics, having been imprisoned in 1621 for opposing the 
Spanish Match. In literature, however, he proved more fortunate. 
His writings supplied materials for Milton, and even helped to 
form Dr. Johnson’s Olympian style.? 
Exeter men played their part in the war. One governed 
St. Michael’s Mount for the Parliament. Another held Pendennis 
Castle for the King. Anthony Ashley Cooper, “ the little man 
with three names,” enlisted upon both sides. He was to spend 
his life fishing in troubled waters, and in 1637 he came up to 
Exeter to trouble the waters there. He spent money freely. 
He was generous to poor scholars. He headed a rebellion against 
the practice of tucking—scraping and torturing freshmen’s 
chins. Ashley’s future colleague in the Cabal, Thomas Clifford, 
was also a Commoner of the College, but was regarded there 
as a youth “of a roving, shattered brain.’”’ Lord Wharton, 
for all his love of dancing, devoted his grace and beauty 
to the Puritans. John Blackmore was among the Regicides. 
Sir Robert Spottiswoode carried the King’s commission from 
Oxford to Montrose, and met his death at the Covenanters’ ~ 
hands. The Duke of Hamilton, whom Cromwell overpowered at 
Preston, and who died on the scaffold soon after the Sovereign 
whom he had served with so little skill, a Cary, a Stanhope, a 
Godolphin, a Trevanion, were among the sufferers for the Royalist 
cause. Exeter gave money to the King, three hundred and ten 
pounds, part of which had to be borrowed. She gave her plate,

  254 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
with ill-concealed reluctance 1; it was against the “ plain, literal 
and grammatical sense’’ of her Statutes. But the King 
graciously offered to dispense with any penalty which such a 
breach of the Statutes might involve. Besides, if his Majesty 
were ‘‘ destroyed in this rebellion,” the College was unlikely to 
survive. She paid her quota for the King’s foot-soldiers, at the 
rate of four shillings a week for each.2 One of the Fellows, 
Henry Tozer, the Sub-Rector, was conspicuous for his Royalism, 
and held out with courage against the Parliamentary Visitation 
of 1648. He carried the majority of the College with him, 
though a substantial minority was willing to submit. A con- 
siderable number of Fellows and others were expelled by the 
Visitors,* and new members appointed in their stead. Hakewill 
was left undisturbed till his death a year later, but then John 
Conant was nominated Rector, and a fresh period of prosperity 
for the College began. 
The new Rector was soon a great figure in Oxford. An 
admirable scholar, he knew Hebrew and Syriac as well as Arabic 
and Chaldee. He disputed publicly in the Schools in Greek. 
Conanti nihil difficile, Dr. Prideaux had said of him, when he 
came up as a poor Somersetshire schoolboy some twenty years 
before. In 1647 he had resigned his Fellowship from conscientious 
scruples. As a Presbyterian he differed on some points from 
the Independents, but Cromwell recognised in him a high example 
of Puritan idealism tempered by common-sense. As a College 
Head of marked discretion and ability, who watched in person 
over the studies of his scholars, saw to their expenses, cared for 
their morals, encouraged worth wherever he found it, and exerted 
himself even to see the College servants taught, Conant drew 
pupils from all parts to the College and made it the most popular 
in the University of his day. He was equally successful as 
Professor of Divinity, as Vice-Chancellor, as Visitor and adviser 
of the Government. His character and moderation won him

2“ We do assure you in word of a King, that this charge shall lie on 
you but one month ”’ (Jb., f. 34, under date of 27 June, 1643). 
# Mr. Boase (cxvii) says that the Visitors in 1648 expelled 10 Fellows 
and 18 other members of the College, and he names 12 who submitted. 
Prof. Burrows’ Tables (Reg. of Visitors, 499-501) give 14 expulsions. It is 
difficult to say how many took effect. For the questions put to Henry 
Tozer, and for the answers given to the Visitors in May 1648, see Burrows 
(13-14 and 60-1), Out of 24 interrogated then 11 submitted. The College 
Register at this time is not very full or informing, and it indicates no 
startling changes in 1660. Langbaine (Foundation of the Universitie)

friends on all sides. He joined in the movement which produced 
the Restoration, but he could not retain the Rectorship in the 
new order of things. Ultimately he conformed to the Church 
of England, and worked on steadily for many years after bidding 
good-bye to Oxford. Wherever he went affection followed him, 
though he cared little for preferment or wealth. His successors 
at Exeter, unhappily, were of a different type, and the College 
rapidly deteriorated under them. Joseph Maynard was so 
nototious a drunkard that even a Bishop of the Restoration 
had to ask him to withdraw. But this weakness, which Charles 
II described as “ his infirm and valetudinary condition,’ was not 
regarded as disqualifying him for a stall at Exeter and a Cornish 
living. And Arthur Bury, called “ Blackberry” because he was 
a little black man, to distinguish him from three others of the 
name, and made Rector in 1666 on the personal recommendation 
of the King, proved so quarrelsome and overbearing that he 
had to be removed in turn by Bishop Trelawney, after he had 
set the whole College by the ears.2 No wonder that Wood 
complained that Conant’s College had become rude, uncivil and 
debauched. 
Space will not suffice for many more details of the College 
history, full of colour as they often are. But the fifteenth- 
century Principal of Mildred Hall who had to go to compurgation 
on a charge of incontinence, is worth a word of notice, if no 
more. So is the Puritan Chaplain of James I, who could not 
stand his Majesty’s strong language, but who did not hesitate 
to denounce his clerical colleagues as soul-murderers himself.4 
So is the anonymous Fellow whose great bottle of beer was 
smuggled into College as a copy of Bellarmine—whence any 
“bottle with a great belly was called a Bellarmine to this day.” 
So are Thomas Chaffyn the Royalist delinquent, who had been 
Chaplain to Shakespeare’s Earl of Pembroke, and Nathaniel 
Norrington, another seventeenth-century controversialist, whose 
tomb, it is said, furnished a hearthstone for the College kitchen, 
and George Hall, a Royalist Bishop of Chester, who left the College 
a Cornish estate and a gold cup, and, not least, Joseph Glanvill,®

the original philosopher, who in his Vanity of Dogmatizing 
denounced the old methods of the Oxford Schools, who defended 
witchcraft, advocated science, and first told the story of the 
Scholar Gipsy, on which a later son of Oxford was to found a 
noble poem. Tales of these and many others are collected in 
the records published by a distinguished member of the College. 
From the day of its foundation Exeter held its own. It struggled 
through its early poverty, lived down vicissitudes and failings, 
and has now for six full centuries in Oxford maintained its 
ancient and honourable name. 
Some ten years after the foundation of Exeter, Oriel College 
started on its life. In April 1324 Adam de Brome, Rector of 
St. Mary’s, a ‘‘ beloved clerk” and almoner to the King, in other 
words a prosperous and influential ecclesiastic, secured the Royal 
license to found a little Society of Scholars “‘ in sacred theology 
and the art of dialectic.’’ He seems to have assigned to them 
Tackley’s Inn in the High Street for a residence, and Perilous 
Hall in Horsemonger Street with some other small property for 
their support. But in January 1326 Edward II, “a learned 
prince and in the time he lived an excellent poet,” received the 
surrender of these possessions, and established the House of the 
Blessed Mary at Oxford to more practical effect. The King 
added to its endowments the advowson of St. Mary’s, and placed 
Adam de Brome at its head. Statutes, modelled largely upon 
those of Merton, provided for a Provost and ten Scholars of 
Bachelor standing, to be nominated in the first place by their 
chief.2- But after the first the Scholars were to be elected. 
They were to choose their own Provost. They were to study 
Arts and Philosophy until allowed to pass on to Theology or 
Law. But this does not seem to have prevented medical 
researches. Before full admission they had to endure a year’s 
1This is presumably the ‘‘ unum messuagium’”’ mentioned in the 
King’s license. Whether any Scholars lived there in 1325, and whether 
the earliest Oriel Scholars lived there or at St. Mary’s Rectory, after the 
King presented it in 1326, is not quite certain. Tackley’s Inn stood 
where 106, High Street stands now. It was afterwards Bulkeley Hall 
(Ogle, Royal Letts. 99, n.), and its refectory apparently existed in Wood’s 
time. Its fine cellar and some other fragments still exist (Hurst, Oxf. 
Topography, 178).

Oriel College. The first Royal Charter was dated December 20, 1324, 
and. the second, the more important, January 21, 1326. The earliest 
Statutes, also dated January 21, 1326, were withheld from publication by 
the Commissioners in 1853, but were privately printed two years later. 
The King’s license speaks of ‘‘ quoddam collegium scholarium in diversis 
scientiis studientium.”

probation. Their selection was, by a rather notable provision, 
free from all restrictions as to locality or Founder’s kin. A 
Dean, unique at Oriel in authority and elected by the Scholars, 
was to assist the Provost, and to replace him when required. 
The Scholars were allowed twelve pence a week for commons : 
the Provost; though he drew other small allowances, shared their 
fare. Their numbers might be increased as revenues permitted, 
and leave was given for the College to acquire property up to 
the value of sixty pounds a year. Their relations with St. 
Mary’s were carefully defined. They were bound to provide 
four Chaplains for the daily service of the Church; and most of 
them were expected to attend it in surplices on Sundays. In 
the rules for accounts and for scrutinies and in several other 
particulars the first Statutes of the new College were content 
to follow the Merton precedent of 1274. 
But in days when thrones were falling, Royal patronage 
was an uncertain thing. Adam de Brome thought it wise to 
secure for his new Society the protection of the powerful Bishop 
of Lincoln, in case its Royal protector failed. Henry Burghersh, 
a worldly and ambitious prelate, one of the ‘‘ Baal sacerdotes, 
alumni Jesabelle,” had already taken up the cause of the Queen. 
In May 1326 the Statutes were re-issued in a form which gave 
the Bishop large powers of control, and which differed materially 
in some points from the regulations of a few months before. 
1These Statutes were confirmed by the Bishop on June 11, 1326. 
(See the originals in the College Archives.) They were printed first by 
Hearne in 1729 in the Appendix to his edition of Trokelowe’s Annals of 
Edward II (295 sq.), and were reprinted by the Commissioners in 1853 
(Stats. of Colls. 1), together with the additions of 1329, and various later 
ordinances. There are earlier charters from the Bishop, dated March 13 
and April 26, 1326, approving the admission of Adam de Brome and the 
impropriation of St. Mary’s Church. I have to thank Mr. Lyon, the 
Treasurer, for allowing me to see these and other College documents, 
which are for the most part very well preserved and often have beautiful 
seals attached: and I have to thank Mr. G. C. Richards also for kind 
help, The original license from the King is in the Archives, dated April 20, 
1324—the date April 28 in Mr. Rannie’s book (4) is a misprint. So is 
the testified copy of the Royal Charter of December 20, 1324—from the 
original once in the Tower of London—reciting the foundation charter of 
Adam de Brome dated a fortnight earlier. So are the Royal Charter of 
January 21, 1326, and the original Statutes of that date. Dr. Shadwell’s 
article in The Colleges of Oxford (87 sq.) gives some account of the materials 
for the College history, His unpublished catalogue of muniments and his 
Registrum Orielense give more details, And he has left transcripts of 
part of the Dean’s Register, which begins in the fifteenth century, and of 
the Treasurers’ accounts which begin in 1409—which I hope may soon 
be published. There are many details of College rents and expenses—the 
latter not always as interesting as one might expect, though the entry 
“ Soluta Pro Potationibus ” is often repeated. Mr. Riley (Second Report 
Hist. MSS. Comm, 137) praises the computi for 1409-15 as the best written

  258 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
The Bishop was now to be the Visitor of the College in place of 
the Crown. He, and not the Royal Chancellor, was to have the 
right to confirm and to remove the Provost. The Provost with 
the consent of the Scholars was to appoint the Dean. The rules 
in regard to study were varied. The Canonists were limited to 
three and must study Civil Law first. Any additional Scholars 
were to study dialectic, before proceeding to theology. A 
common seal for the College was provided, to be kept by two 
discreet and trustworthy Scholars, who also acted as Treasurers 
or Bursars, and joined the Provost in rendering an annual account 
of the receipts and expenses of the House. The Scholars were 
to be consulted on questions of importance, and were to co-operate 
with the Provost in making fresh Statutes, subject to the 
Bishop’s assent. And the Bishop was given the power to inter- 
pret and correct the Statutes in any case of obscurity or doubt. 
Three years later, before the end of 1329, when the price | 
of corn rose high, and when additional property had come in, 
the Provost and Fellows took advantage of their power to make 
additional Statutes. The Provost was allowed to be chosen 
outside the ranks of existing Fellows; to hold a benefice, to 
keep a separate table, and to draw for stipend as much as ten 
marks a year. The Dean was to have ten shillings yearly, the 
two Fellows acting as Bursars and the one who collected the 
autumn tithes of Littlemore five shillings each. The Fellows 
were each to receive pittances, of five shillings at Christmas and 
Easter, and of forty pence at Whitsuntide. Commons were to 
be increased to fifteen pence a week so long as bread was so dear. 
The manciple was to be paid a mark, the cook half a mark, the 
barber ten shillings.2 There were new provisions also for the 
settlement of disputes within the College, for weekly disputations, 
for the yearly inspection and division of the College books.* 
Bishop and King approved these regulations. The Statutes, 
though modified from time to time by later ordinances,‘ took 
and most intelligible accounts of that date known to him. There is an 
older College Register dating from 1397 in the British Museum (Lansdowne, 
386), consisting chiefly of notes on College properties. 
1 Dum tamen idem sic electus socius juratus ejusdem domus prius 
extiterit (Stats. of Colls. I, Oriel, 14). Scholars and Fellows in these 
Statutes are of course the same. 
2 There are discrepancies about these figures. The Statutes printed 
in 1853 allot 5s. a year to each Bursar and tithe-collector: Mr. Rannie 
makes it ros. (p. 15). The printed Statutes make the barber’s pay Ios., 
Mr. Rannie tod. Hearne’s version of the Statutes (App. to Trokelowe, 310) 
confirms the figures given in the text. 
3 Each Fellow in turn chose a book for a year (Siats., Oriel, 14-15). 
“Ordinances by various Bishops, from Bishop Burghersh in the 
fourteenth century, down to Bishop Longland in the sixteenth, are printed 
in the Statutes of Colleges (I, Oriel, 18-40), and Hearne, in his edition of 
Trokelowe, carries them down to 1612.
-P-A-G-E-294
  _THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 259 
their final form, and in effect the code of Bishop Burghersh 
governed the College for four hundred years, until in the eighteenth 
century the Court of Common Pleas made the surprising discovery 
that the original Statutes of January 1326 were still in force. 
In 1331 Pope John XXII confirmed the little corporation. Its 
seal, with Adam de Brome in a posture of devotion, still survives. 
And College tradition, though meticulous antiquarians may doubt 
it, still treasures the Founder’s cup presented by an unkingly if 
poetical King.? 
Bishop Burghersh, whatever his opinions, proved a useful 
friend. Early in the reign of Edward III the College possessions 
were increased. The advowson of Coleby in Lincolnshire was 
secured.2. The Hospital of St. Bartholomew outside Oxford, 
where the hill climbs up to Cowley, was annexed to the College, 
with all its property in or near the town. But the townsmen 
seem to have resented the arrangement, and for two hundred 
years they disputed the charges payable for almsmen there.? 
The Provost of Oriel, already Rector of St. Mary’s, became 
Warden of the Hospital as well. And the house founded by 
Henry I as a refuge for lepers became the resort of Oriel Fellows 
in search of purer air. Other property in Oxford, houses, shops 
and gardens South of St. Mary’s Rectory—Tackley’s Inn lay 
a little further West—and other holdings outside Oxford, came 
in. Moyses Hall in St. Aldate’s parish and Baner Hall in 
St. Mary Magdalen’s were acquired under the will of Adam de 
Brome, to the last a generous friend of the College. Above all an 
important tenement named La Oriole, at the corner of Shidyerd 
Street and St. John Street,* once the property of Queen Eleanor 
of Provence, was secured before the end of 1329. It became 
the headquarters of the Society, and its name soon afterwards 
displaced the older titles of the Blessed Mary’s House or the 
King’s Hall.5 As the century proceeded, the College acquired

2 Partly through Adam de Brome, who had presented the advowson 
of Aberford in Yorkshire in 1324. 
3 The College seems to have paid what it was bound to pay for the 
maintenance and clothing of the almsmen; but the town was unwilling 
to pay its share, in spite of the King’s commands. Litigation began in 
1390, but there was trouble much earlier. See Rannie (22-3) and Ogle 
(Royal Letis. 46). 
4 Now Oriel Street and Merton Street. Mr. Hurst (Oxf. Topog. 195-6) 
gives a sketch of the College site. He prefers the name “‘ Le Oryole.” 
See also Rannie (62-5). St. Mary’s Rectory stood close to the corner of 
Oriel Street and High Street, but shops grew up on the High Street front. 
The ground and tenements South and East of it, towards Merton Street 
and Grove Street, were acquired mostly in the fourteenth century.

Worthies of All Souls, 25). So was ‘‘ the Hall or College of the Blessed

  260 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
most of the ground between La Oriole and the High Street, 
stretching Eastward to Grope Lane.t In the old Rectory St. 
Mary Hall developed, distinct from the College but under its 
control. The Fellows’ revenues grew and their allowances were 
augmented. In 1397 a Register of title-deeds and charters was 
required. A few years later the Treasurers’ accounts, known 
later as “ The Style,” ,begin. And in the sixteenth century the 
Dean’s Register was regularly kept. Disappointing as these 
records are in their domestic details, which if set out with more 
fullness might have proved delightful reading, they give clues to 
the resources and progress of the House. It appears that early 
in the fifteenth century the net income of the College was some- 
thing under ninety pounds a year.? 
The little Society had its inevitable struggles, irregularities 
in the conduct of its Fellows, disputed elections to its Headship, 
and outbreaks. of faction after the fashion of the times. In 1349 
turbulent Southerners, led by John Wylliott of Merton, attacked 
Provost Hawkesworth when elected Chancellor, at St. Mary’s 
Church. Hawkesworth retorted by producing a Bull; issued 
some years earlier by, Pope John XXII, forbidding “ illicit 
conventicles ”’ in the church or churchyard. There were troubles 
over the doctrines of Wycliffe, and fierce contests for the 
Provostship in the years following Wycliffe’s death. There was 
trouble over Archbishop Arundel’s high*handed acts of power. 
Arundel himself was the most distinguished of the early Com- 
moners attached to the Society, and in his old College he found 
foemen worthy of his.steel. John Byrche, the intrepid Proctor of 
1411, who held St. Mary’s against the Archbishop, was an Oriel 
man.* So was William Symon, his successor, and as strong 
an opponent of Archi-episcopal encroachments. So were other 
Fellows even more mutinous and lawless, like Thomas Wilton, 
a truculent champion of the North, who slew a scholar in the 
Chancellor's lodgings and woke up the Provost to challenge 
him to fight, or John Rote, the Dean, the “root” of all the

* Drawn principally from rents in Oxford, from the tithe of the three 
churches at Aberford, Coleby and Littlemore, and from offerings in 
St. Mary’s (Colls. of Oxford, 100). 
8 Oriel favoured the North. Mr. Rannie claims (30) for Hawkesworth 
a ‘substantial victory.” His death, however, immediately afterwards 
probably cleared the way for Wylliott. Hawkesworth’s immediate 
successors, Daventre and Colyntre, were followed by seven other Provosts 
between 1387 and 1427, of whom Mr. Rannie (Chap. III) gives a careful 
account. For Hawkeswerth’s connection with Queen’s College and 
Balliol see later-{p. 269, n.). 
“Though Wood assigns him to University College. For the struggle 
with Arundel see ante (pp. 238-9). The record of Archbishop Arundel’s 
Visitation in the College Archives has been used by Mr. Rannie.

evil, who bade the Devil break the Archbishop’s neck. Flat 
rebellion, if not flat Lollardy, for a time made Oriel its home. 
And Reginald Pecock carried from Oriel into a wider world, where 
hewon preferment, fame and persecution, a bold appeal to reasonas 
the ground of faith, which even Lollards might not have disavowed. 
But these storms passed. Provost Corffe, indeed, elected in 
the year of Agincourt, devoted himself to the Council of Constance, 
where Wycliffe’s heresies were finally condemned. But other 
notable Provosts in the fifteenth century raised the College to 
a high level of success. John Carpenter and Walter Lyhert 
both rose to Bishoprics under Henry VI, both combined the 
Headship with other preferments, and both, Carpenter especially, 
were generous to their old College. Benefactions flowed in. 
Manors were bequeathed or purchased. The College endowments 
rapidly increased. Within a hundred years eight new Fellow- 
ships were added to the original ten, most of them limited to 
particular districts, though the unrestricted freedom of the 
earlier ones remained. John Frank, who under the House of 
Lancaster was both an Archdeacon and a Master of the Rolls, 
gave four of these new Fellowships. Bishop Carpenter founded 
another, for candidates from his diocese of Worcester. Bishop 
Smyth, whose fame is linked with Brasenose, helped in the 
sixteenth century to found a sixth. And Dr. Richard Dudley, 
once Principal of St. Mary Hall, added two more in 1525. The 
new Fellowships required alterations in the Statutes, and the 
new revenues permitted certain additions to the pay and 
perquisites of members of the College.* Exhibitions were 
established also. Carpenter, with Lyhert’s co-operation, founded 
six Exhibitions, charged on the lands of St. Anthony’s Hospital 
in London, of which he had been Master. Dudley founded 
six more Exhibitions in 1529. The Exhibitioners were for a 
long while lodged at St. Mary Hall, and as a class they never 
rose to importance in the College.* They seem never to have 
attained to the rank of junior Scholars—Scholars in the modern 
sense—or to have had any such claim to succeed to Fellow- 
ships later as was enjoyed by some of the younger members 
of other foundations. Commoners gradually appeared. The

even these had their distinctions, and the Exhibitioners might perhaps have 
objected to being identified with either.

appearance of Scholastici under training to be Scholares’’ (Rannie, 72-3).

out at Oriel is not clear.

    262 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Commensales were young men of wealth and family, like Thomas 
Arundel, who shared the table of the Fellows. The Extranet 
and Communarii, Strangers and Commoners who lodged in the 
College, were at first generally men of academic standing, but 
they developed into the undergraduate community of later times. 
The most famous of these guests, to whom the College in the 
fifteenth century gave quarters and a life-long welcome, was 
Thomas Gascoigne, theologian, controversialist and Chancellor, a 
familiar and a stimulating personage in the Oxford of that day. 
The Wars of the Roses left the College prosperous, but Tudor 
administrators noted that laxity had crept in. Bishop Longland 
had to remind the Provost and Fellows of their duties. More 
care of the College was needed, more regular residence. Order, 
obedience, proper conduct, proper dress must be enforced. 
Bachelors doing wrong must be corrected. Strangers must not 
be brought so freely ® into the’sleeping-places. Disputations 
must not be neglected. The new love of the classics must not 
oust the older learning. The old obligation to study theology 
must be maintained. In matters of high policy the College 
may have felt difficulty about obeying the King. One former 
Fellow indeed, Edward Powell—and he was not the only one— 
stood by the Church he was bred in, pleaded for the rights of 
Queen Catharine, and bravely suffered death. But the worst 
trials of the Reformation passed Oriel by. Provost Smyth, 
elected under King Edward,* kept his place under Mary and 
Elizabeth. William Allen, Fellow of Oriel and Principal of St. 
Mary Hall, took his unbending Catholicism abroad‘ to Douai, 
and secured the honours of a Cardinal at Rome. Provost 
Blencowe in his long reign saved money for the College buildings, 
and saw the Elizabethan changes which swept students into 
1 The great increase of Commoners begins under Elizabeth, when all 
students are brought into Colleges or Halls. Occasional Commensales 
are found much earlier, and Extranet lodging in the College also. See 
Shadwell (Registrum Orielense, Preface, v to x) and Rannie (37 and 72-6). 
Gutch, in his enumeration of the Oxford Colleges in 1612, allots thirty 
Commoners to Oriel (Collectanea Curiosa, I, 196. sq.), following Twyne’s 
figures (MS. XXI, 515). Twyne makes the total numbers of the College at 
that date 79. Langbaine (Found. of Univ. of Oxf.) makes the total 106 
in 1651.

3 In 1550, though the King’s Council had put forward William Turner, 
famous as botanist and Protestant preacher. Smyth’s successor, Marbeck, 
was brought in irregularly from Christ Church, bat only held office for a 
year. The College disliked the Edwardian chang¢s. 
Mr. Rannie does not seem to mention Cardinal Allen. But he must 
have been between 1550 and 1565 a conspicuous member of the College. 
His tutor, Morgan Phillips and other leading Romanists were there. »

Colleges and broke down still further the old independence of 
the Halls. A steady flow of Commoners began. They soon 
exceeded the Fellows in number, and increased the pressure on 
the accommodation of the College, St. Mary Hall increased as 
well. Under Leicester’s Chancellorship the Hall was separated 
from the College to which it had been from the first so closely 
attached. But Oriel continued to supply it with Principals 
for many years to come. 
Provost Blencowe ruled over the College from 1574 to 1618. 
William Lewis, Francis Bacon’s Chaplain, afterwards Secretary 
to the ill-fated Buckingham, succeeded for three years only as a 
very young man,? and his admirable skill in writing begging- 
letters proved of value in collecting funds for the new buildings. 
John Tolson, who had been an Exhibitioner in 1590 and who 
spent over half a century in the College, was Provost from 162 
to 1644. He lived long enough to see the new buildings com- 
pleted and the College finances ruined by the war. Rents fell 
short. Timber had to be felled, commons reduced, and Fellow- 
ships left vacant. Royalist guests were quartered on the College. 
Oriel is said to have given her plate to the King with joy, but 
it is to be feared that the joy was soon turned into mourning. 
Pre miseria temporum the autumnal audits had to be postponed. 
John Saunders succeeded in critical days, but he died in office 
nine years later. From the Provost and Dean downwards the 
Fellows were largely Cavaliers. And the Parliamentary Visitation 
in 1648 dealt faithfully with them. They fenced with the 
Visitors’ questions and tried to avoid direct submission. But 
the majority of them seem to have lost their places. The 
crisis passed and the new-comers were absorbed. Robert Say, the 
Dean, quietly succeeded to the Provostship in 1653, and held it 
in spite of all vicissitudes for nearly forty years. Court corrup- 
tion had its counterpart in the Oxford of the Restoration. One 
member of the College burdened it with debt. There was 
bribery in the election of Fellows—the “ Devil of buying and 
selling,” lamented Dean Fell. Say’s high-handed method of 
pushing a nominee of his own into a Fellowship led to a sharp 
1Shidyerd Street took the name of St. Mary Lane from about 1545 
or earlier until 1772, before it became Oriel Lane (Salter, Names of Oxford 
Streets, 19). 
2 To confirm Lewis’ appointment the Lord Chancellor’s authority was 
called in (as well as the Bishop’s), thus reverting to the intention of the 
orignal Statutes of January 1326 (Rannie, 96). 
* Mr. Rannie estimates that only 5 Fellows were finally removed, 
of whom 2 were soon restored (105). But I should put the number 
of expulsions higher. Prof. Burrows thinks (Register, 536-7 and 571) 
that 10 or 12 members of the College were expelled. (See also 
Burrows, cxxv and 65-6.)

quarrel. The Bishop of Lincoln, as Visitor, had to interfere. 
A Commission of inquiry was appointed, which insisted that 
the majority of Fellows should have a voice in all elections, and 
that a new Fellow, once elected, should be admitted without 
delay. Say tried to appeal to the King, but he was compelled 
to yield, for all his ‘‘ Hectoring.” His action was the beginning 
of troubles which produced a law-suit later. His successor, the 
last Provost of the seventeenth century, had been Chaplain to 
King William, and bitter Tories could find little merit in the 
man. They even alleged that he was chosen “at Mother Shep- 
herd’s at Heddington”’ by a majority of the Fellows with whom 
he used to drink. 
Distinguished names, great names, touch the College history 
in Tudor and Stuart times. There is good ground for believing 
that the ‘‘ W. Rawley,”’ who figures in the list for 1572, was the 
superb adventurer and statesman whose name shone like a star 
in the succeeding age. Traditions repeated by Aubrey? tell 
us that Ralegh at Oxford had ‘‘a kind of pigg-eie’”” and was 
full of pride, that he talked with a broad Devonshire accent, 
and appropriated some one else’s gown after the recognised 
manner of a buccaneer. Henry Unton, a descendant of the 
Protector Somerset, served at Zutphen with Sir Philip Sidney 
and before Rouen with Henry of Navarre. Sir Robert Harley, 
a sturdy Puritan of the Long Parliament, was an Oriel Fellow- 
Commoner in Elizabethan days. Prynne, a fiercer Puritan, 
was born on College property, and was like his father a tenant 
of the College. He never outgrew his affection for it. He left 
to its Library “my Ocham upon the Sentences’’ and “ one of 
each sort of my owne printed bookes.’’ Richard Brathwaite, 
“Dapper Dick,” a poet and romancer of widely different senti- 
ments, did not hesitate to mock at Puritan precision in verse 
which delighted the opposite party.* Others, like Hannibal 
Baskerville, the solitary eccentric, who so cherished wandering 
beggars that he put up a special bell for them at his back door,® 
1 Brief Lives (II, 177 sq.). For the biographies of The Provosts and 
Fellows of Oriel valuable material has been collected by Mr. G. C. Richards 
and Dr. Shadwell in a volume which, as I write, is passing through the 
Tess. 
Rss See Barnabe Itinerarium or Barnabee’s Journal (ed. Haslewood and 
Hazlitt, 1876). 
3 Baskerville is better known as a student of Brasenose (Wood, Life, 
I, 270). Mr, Rannie mentions quite properly among Exhibitioners and 
members of Oriel (Chap. V) several distinguished men who were more 
closely connected afterwards with other Colleges. Early students moved 
about so freely that it is not always easy to decide under which heading 
they should be put. For instance, John Rouse began at Balliol and 
Scroggs moved on to Pembroke. Roger Mainwaring, the Royalist divine, 
and John Birkenhead, the Royalist pamphleteer, both joined Oriel but

John Rouse, Bodley’s Librarian and Milton’s friend, Scroggs, 
the unscrupulous Chief Justice of the Popish Plot, Holt a Chief 
Justice in a better era, who “‘ sat in triumph over and contempt 
of vice,’ have their places among the men of notoriety or reputa- 
tion who all added to the fame of the College. 
Among the buildings, of which La Oriole was for long the 
chief, the Library has points of special interest. The College 
books are mentioned in the early Statutes, and provision is made 
for their use and inspection. Bishop Cobham of Worcester, 
who died in the same year as Edward II, bequeathed his books 
to the University, and a room was built to receive them over the 
Congregation House at St. Mary’s Church. But the Bishop 
died in debt, before the room was finished. Adam de Brome 
bought the books from his executors and bestowed them on his 
own College; and there they remained till 1337, when the 
University authorities forcibly carried them away. The College, 
which had rights over St. Mary’s, retorted by trying to bar the 
University out of the new building there, and for the better part 
of a century the dispute continued, while the College quietly 
accumulated another library for itself. Donations and bequests 
came in. Early Provosts, Adam de Brome and William de 
Daventre, both, it seems, gave largely. Bishop Rede left ten 
books, to be firmly chained. A catalogue, dating from 1375,1 
shows that theology was well represented. Aquinas and Scotus, 
Aristotle, Priscian, Justinian, figured among the inevitable 
authors. But none of the classical writers found a place. In 
course of time the University secured possession of the Old 
Congregation House at St. Mary’s, and in 1444 the College 
determined that its collection could no longer be kept in chests. 
A Library was built, to which Thomas Gascoigne seems to have 
subscribed, on the East side of the original quadrangle. Fifteenth- 
century Provosts contributed to it. One interesting manuscript 
has the autograph of Duke Humphrey of Gloucester; it was 
John Capgrave’s present tohim. And the famous “ St. Jerome,” 
dated 1468, upholds almost aggressively the honour of the early 
Oxford Press.2 In the rebuilding of the seventeenth century 
the Library found a home in the new quadrangle on its Northern 
passed to All Souls. Gerard Langbaine, the well-known Provost of 
Queen’s, held a Dudley Exhibition though he was a member of Queen’s 
College. These Exhibitions were closely connected with Queen’s, and do 
not seem to have always involved residence at Oriel (Magrath, The Queen’s 
College, II, 2). 
1 Dr. Shadwell printed this catalogue in Collectanea (I, 57 sq.). It 
probably dates from 1375, not 1349. But the books mentioned in it have 
disappeared, and Bishop Cobham’s books were apparently never recovered.

side. The eighteenth century was to substitute another and 
more formidable structure, endeared to later generations by the 
famous Common Rooms with their memorials below. 
In the first quadrangle grouped about La Oriole, always the 
main site of the College, the first Chapel was licensed in 1373.1 
Richard Earl of Arundel, warrior and statesman, and the Arch- 
bishop, his son, contributed generously to its completion in the 
years that followed. The arms of Fitzalan were blazoned with 
those of Lancaster and Mortimer and others on its ancient glass. 
Under Henry VIII a new Hall was built in this quadrangle, to 
replace an older chamber where tradition said that a Mayor of 
Oxford had been hanged. But both were swept away in the 
great rebuilding begun in 1619, with funds bequeathed by Provost 
Blencowe or collected by Provost Lewis’ persuasive pen. The 
South and West sides of the original court, facing St. John Street 
and Shidyerd Street, were taken down and replaced. A few 
years later, about 1636, fresh contributions were collected, and 
the North and East sides were rebuilt with the same success,? 
constituting a new quadrangle, “‘ the neatest and most uniform 
as any in Oxon.” The College quarry at Headington supplied 
the quickly crumbling stone. A new Chapel and Hall rose 
opposite the gateway. Figures of Edward II and James I,* 
surmounted by the Virgin, crowned the beautiful portico between. 
There were new chambers on three sides of the quadrangle and 
the Provost’s Lodgings on the North. By 1642 the work was 
regarded as finished, and the new Chapel was opened for service 
on the eve of the Civil War. An.archway on the North led into 
the College garden, where, early in the century which followed, 
fresh benefactors contributed new wings for a second court. 
Further North again lay the old, irregular buildings of St. Mary 
Hall; a separate community but the most ancient home of the 
College.* Finally, outside the city, St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, 
set amid its meadows, was rebuilt in the difficult days of 1651, 
and the screen then placed in its venerable Chapel still bears the 
date and the initials of the College, which Wood’s lively prejudice 
mistook for Oliver Cromwell’s, cut in his honour by “ the saints ” 
he led. 
1 Bereblock’s plan shows it on the South side of the quadrangle, where, 
no doubt, it stood. 
2 The East side was probably pushed further back. The new Chapel 
covered the site of St. Martin’s Hall at the South-east corner, which was 
probably beyond the limits of the first quadrangle and was not acquired 
till the sixteenth century began (Rannie, 65 and 100). 
’It is hard to think that this figure represents Charles I. The re- 
building began under King James. But I admit the point is doubtful. 
* The Hall paid rent for most of its buildings to the College—amounting 
to £3 in the latter years of the nineteenth century (Rashdall II, 762).

  THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 267 
The “ Hall of the Scholars of the Queen ”’ in Oxford received 
the Royal license in January 1341.1 Robert of Eglesfield, 
Chaplain to Queen Philippa, a Cumberland man of gentle blood, 
who may possibly in earlier days have represented his county in 
Parliament, determined to found a College at Oxford, under the 
special patronage of English Queens, for the cultivation of 
theology and the benefit of the Church. He bestowed on it the 
manor of Renwick in Cumberland and certain tenements and 
garden ground in Oxford near St. Peter’s in the East. These 
included a small property, which he had purchased from Univer- 
sity College in May 1340, fronting on the lane which now separates 
New College from Queen’s ; and here, in the North-west corner 
of the College precincts, where the laboratory, the stables and 
the garden afterwards grew up, Eglesfield’s earliest Scholars 
must have looked for a home.? But they very soon found a 
1 The words “ collegiate hall,”’ quandam aulam collegialem, are used in 
the license (Stats. of Colls. I, Queen’s, 4). 
2 Temple Hall, which some have thought the first site of the College, 
lay a little further to the North-west, where the garden of the Warden of 
New College runs. It was purchased by Eglesfield in December 1340, and 
he also bought several plots of ground to the North and East of the College 
site, which were sold later to William of Wykeham. . Mr. H. E. Salter has 
contributed a clear and valuable note on this subject (Appendix C) to 
the first volume of Dr. Magrath’s recently published history of The Queen’s 
College. I need not say that I am repeatedly indebted to these volumes, 
which with their ample notes and referencesrepresent many years’ study 
of the subject, as I am also to the Provost’s kindness in answering questions 
and to his earlier writings. These volumes really supersede the earlier 
sketches and references in Wood (Colleges), Ingram (Memorials, 1), Chalmers 
(University of Oxford, 1), the Second and Fourth Reports of the Historical 
MSS. Commission, and elsewhere. In Appendix A Dr. Magrath gives a 
full account of the materials for the College history. In Appendix D he 
prints the earliest surviving Long Roll, College accounts for 1348. The 
College Archives were classified and calendared in the eighteenth century 
by E. R. Mores, who also made collections for its history, six volumes of 
which, preserved in the Bodleian, are described by Dr. Magrath. The 
College Registers contain notes on a variety of subjects, records of elections, 
copies of documents and summaries of accounts. But the most interesting 
materials perhaps are the College Computi, the Long Rolls containing the 
accounts, which begin in 1348. Eight volumes of transcripts from these, 
containing the accounts, with very few omissions, from 1348 to 1470, 
have been made by Mr. C. L. Stainer and indexed. Earlier transcripts 
also exist of the Computi from 1592 to 1790: but those from 1470 to 1592 
have not yet been transcribed. Dr. Magrath’s quotations from these 
accounts in his notes give a special interest to his history, and to his care 
the admirable arrangement of the College documents is chiefly due. The 
Provost allowed me to see several of these documents, including some 
early Long Rolls, Registers G and H, which bear witness to the energies 
of Provosts like Robinson, Langbaine and others, the Elizabethan Queens 
College Book, confirming the College property, the Entrance Book, begun 
about 1634, and the Liber Albus Benefactorum dating from about the end 
of the seventeenth century. But in a case where the work done has been

permanent residence in a house adjoining this upon the East, 
which William of Muskham, the Founder’s friend, acquired for 
them in 1341. Muskham’s purchase, inhabited at one time by 
the monks of Christ Church, Canterbury, had a wide gateway 
facing St. Peter’s Church. It corresponded roughly with the 
present North Quadrangle. And a few shops to the South-east 
of it, opposite Edmund or St. Edmund Hall, on the spot where 
the main entrance of the College was to rise, extended its pos- 
sessions towards the High Street, which before long they would 
inevitably reach. Muskham was only one of several friends 
whose gifts were greatly needed to carry out Eglesfield’s am- 
bitious plans. Three knightly benefactors of Edward III’s day 
contributed materially, and the widow .of a fourth.1 Queen 
Philippa, who is often spoken of as Foundress, whom Eglesfield 
did his best to associate with the College, and whose famous 
wooden image is still preserved among its treasures, contributed 
still more. She secured the Pope’s approval for the establish- 
ment of the Society, for the appropriation of churches, and for 
the building of a Chapel. She made a grant for the sustenance 
of the Scholars, when other sustenance perhaps was running 
low. And she probably induced.the King to bestow on it its 
most valuable endowment, the Wardenship of St. Julian’s 
Hospital or God’s House in Southampton, founded long before 
by Gervase the Rich, and destined long afterwards to add 
materially to the riches of the-College.? 
Eglesfield seems to have made his home within the walls of 
his foundation, and to have acted as its Provost while he lived. 
His Statutes indeed nominated Richard de Retteford as the first 
Provost, together with twelve other Fellows whose names are 
given, and half of whom may have been Merton men. But only 
four of the original nominees, and Retteford is not among them, 
are found in 1348 in the first record of those enjoying the benefits 
of the College. Richard of Retteford is mentioned as a Fellow 
of Balliol in 1325 and as a Fellow of ‘‘ University Hall” in 1343. 
He was connected in turn with the dioceses of York and of 
Hereford. And it is doubtful if he ever undertook the duties 
of Provost. Eglesfield was certainly acting in 1348, and on his 
death, in 1349, William Muskham apparently replaced him,® 
so recent and so full, I have not thought it necessary to go beyond the 
quotations which Dr. Magrath’s history contains, 
1Sir Robert Achard, SirJohn de Handlo, Sir John de Stowford, and 
Isabel the widow of Sir Robert Parvyng, a distinguished judge. (See 
Dr. Magrath’s notes to his history, I, 10, 16, 17, 23, and his Liber Obituarius 
Aule Regina, 91, 83, 66, 88.)

to be succeeded by John Hotham a year later. The little com- 
munity had a struggle to exist. The Provost’s place was of no 
great value, and there were hardly ever half-a-dozen Fellows 
gathered round him in those early years. It was not till the end 
of the fifteenth century that their number began to rise above 
seven. Eglesfield spent his last years among them, impoverished 
perhaps by his own liberality. Various little charges—pennies 
for his oblations upon feast-days and half-pennies for parchment 
for writing his letters—were paid by the College on his behalf. 
When he died, they made a “ great burning for him,” using 
eleven pounds of wax and spending fourpence-three-farthings 
upon wine. His famous horn, for which the wine may have 
been needed, survived the sacrifices of the Civil War and still 
remains the loving-cup of the College.? 
The Statutes, drawn up by the Founder, had a character 
and elaboration of their own. They depended comparatively 
little on the precedents of Merton. Religion and charity mingled 
largely with Eglesfield’s design, prayers for the souls of others 
and alms for the poor of the town: and he must have taken a 
whimsical pleasure in some of its details. The Provost and 
twelve Scholars or Fellows, like our Lord and the Apostles in 
medieval paintings, were to sit on three sides of the high table 
only, a custom which they followed until recent years. All the 
original Fellows were Masters,* and all Fellows were expected 
to take priest’s Orders. But besides theologians there might 
services to the College (Ib. 99-101, and Liber Obit. 5, 13, 56, 67-9). Of the 
thirteen Fellows named in the Statutes only Hawkesworth, Cundale, 
Polmorva and Colingham reappear in 1348, in the Long Roll which 
Dr. Magrath prints (L{App. D). These four, two Chaplains and one Poor 
Boy, were then drawing commons. Hawkesworth’s story presents some 
difficulties. Connected first, it seems, with Balliol, he was a Fellow of 
Oriel in August 1341 and Provost of Oriel from November 1348 to 
April 1349. But he must have been for a time Fellow of Queen’s, and was 
certainly drawing commons there between March and September 1348 
(Ib. I, 91, 94-5, 333-8, and II, 413). 
1 Magrath (I, 97,n.). From the Long Rolls it appears that the number 
of Fellows rose to 8 or 9 at the end of the fifteenth century, and to 11 in 
1534-5; that in the sixteenth century they fluctuated a good deal, fall- 
ing to 4 under Queen Mary, and rising higher generally under Elizabeth ; 
that in 1590 they rose to 12—possibly for the first time ; and that after 
1600 they did not often fall below that figure. 
2 Skelton (Oxonia, I) has a picture of the horn, which has generally 
passed as the Founder’s. So has Dr. Magrath, with some interesting notes 
(I, xviii and 22). It has been mistaken for a trumpet and accused of 
speaking ‘‘ pure Athenian.” 
*It was to be ‘‘aulam quandam collegiarem Magistrorum, capella- 
norum, theologorum et aliorum scholarium ad ordinem sacerdotii promo- 
vendorum ” (Stats. of Colls. I, Queen’s, 6). I quote from the Statutes 
printed in 1853. Dr. Magrath (I, Chap. II) describes them fully, with 
more detail than I can give.

be a limited number of law students destined to incept in Canon 
Law. The theologians were allowed eighteen years to complete 
their studies, the Canonists, it seems, thirteen. They forfeited 
their Fellowships by grave misconduct, by entering religion, by 
neglecting their studies, and by acquiring an independent income 
of ten marks a year. Natives of Cumberland and Westmorland, 
poor, waste, unlettered districts, and specially the Founder’s 
kinsmen, were to enjoy a certain preference. So also places 
where the College had livings or lands.1_ In theory open to all 
the world, it was largely in fact a North Country foundation, 
with the Archbishop of York for its Visitor ; but Southerners 
were not to be shut out. Robed in blood-red, in memory of 
Christ’s Passion, the Fellows were to live in some comfort and 
style. Ten marks a year were allotted for the clothing and 
maintenance of each, of which eighteen pence a week, or if 
necessary two shillings, were set apart for commons. The 
Provost, the ruler and manager of the College, was given five 
marks of additional income, which might rise, as the numbers 
and revenues grew, to as much as forty pounds a year. He was 
to have his own servant or clerk. He might, if he could afford 
it, have a separate table and live outside the College. The 
Visitor, who confirmed him, had power to remove him. But a 
Provost deposed for old age or infirmity had a claim to a pension 
and to quarters in the precincts. There was a similar provision 
for incapacitated Fellows. Eglesfield intended his Scholars to 
be liberally treated, and by the middle of the fifteenth century 
it seems that they could sometimes save money if they chose.® 
Thrice in the year, when circumstances permitted, surplus 
revenues were to be divided among them. And at the same 
time a solemn inquiry was to be held into matters of discipline 
and conduct. The provision for servants was liberal: indeed 
1 Eglesfield certainly contemplated the admission of Scholars outside 
Cumberland and Westmorland : and a decree of Richard II’s reign provided 
that elections from these two counties or from Founder’s kin should be 
balanced by elections from places where the College held property or 
from members of the University. But the practice of confining elections 
to the two counties, with its inevitable consequences, prevailed. The 
whole subject was vigorously discussed in 1854, when John Barrow pleaded 
for the closed system in The Case of Queen’s College, Oxford, and William 
Thomson, afterwards Archbishop, retorted in An Open College best for ail. 
It was difficult to press the claim for special endowments for unlettered 
districts in counties where Wordsworth, Southey, Coleridge and De 
Quincey had made their home. 
2 That was to be the maximum, when there were forty Fellows. 
3 See the will quoted by Mr. Anstey (Mun. Acad. 592 sq.). 
«“ Portionem insuper, ultra communam ”’ (Stats., Queen’s, 17). Pre- 
sumably this means a portion beyond the 10 marks allowed for each, as 
well as beyond the 2s, allotted for commons.
-P-A-G-E-310
  THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 271 
the whole scheme was far too liberal for the funds in hand. The 
College was to have its butler, its cook, its kitchen-boy, its 
gardener, its barber and its baker, its brewery and mill, and a 
night-watchman, to remind it of the time to rest and the time 
to labour, who nevertheless failed to prevent an exceptional 
number of fires. ‘‘A larger multitude of servants” was to be 
forthcoming if required. The Fellows were summoned to dinner 
by a trumpet. French might be talked as well as Latin at 
meals: Court fashions perhaps were popular with an old Court 
Chaplain. And a sum of forty pounds was to be set apart each 
year for the purchase of victuals and fuel. But excess in food 
and drink was forbidden ; so was the haunting of taverns, the 
keeping of hawks and hounds, dangerous games like dice and 
chess which led to gambling, and musical instruments which 
provoked levity and interfered with work. Woe to those who 
played among the birds of the air, or who gave to dogs the bread 
of the sons of men! The stabling of horses in the College was 
condemned. The Founder thought no detail too insignificant 
to settle for his College—the colour of the Fellows’ and the 
Chaplains’ garments, the weight of their loaves, the enter- 
tainment of their visitors, and even the washing of their 
heads. 
At Queen’s the ecclesiastical element was unusually strong. 
Besides the Fellows, who were bound to take priest’s Orders, 
the Founder contemplated a staff of thirteen Chaplains, whose 
duties and allowances were carefully defined. One was to be 
Dean of the Chapel with control over the rest. Two were to be 
Precentors, the fourth was to be Sacrist, the fifth a Bible Reader, 
the sixth the almoner, and the seventh the Treasurer’s clerk. 
Two Fellows were elected to act as Treasurer and Chamberlain 
—we might call them senior and junior Bursars—who were 
responsible with the Provost for the College seal and property, 
for its muniments and its accounts; while a third officer, the 
Steward of the Hall, was elected weekly to superintend the 
service and the cost of meals. But more distinctive were the 
Poor Boys, elected on much the same basis as the Fellows, who 
were intended by the Founder to increase till they equalled in 
number the seventy-two disciples, and some of whom were 
admitted before they were fourteen. For them a regular course 
of education was devised, the most systematic Arts teaching 
1 But it is doubtful if they ever exceeded two (Barrow, Case of Queen’s 
Coil. 9). 
2 They received 12 pence a week for commons and 28 shillings a year for 
clothes and expenses, besides small payments for special duties. Masses 
and prayers for benefactors were prescribed in detail (Statutes, Queen’s, 
26 sq.).
-P-A-G-E-311
  272 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
as yet contemplated within College walls. They were to learn 
grammar, philosophy and logic from two teachers specially 
assigned. They were to serve as choir-boys and to be taught 
chanting by two clerks acting under the Chaplains. They were 
to converse only in Latin or French. They were to dispute with 
the Fellows at dinner and supper, to answer posers before they 
earned their food. At times, though rarely, they might be 
called upon to wait in Hall. If they became Masters of Arts 
they could compete for Fellowships.1. Robert of Eglesfield 
perhaps meditated what William of Wykeham soon after accom- 
plished, linking a community of schoolboys with his College. 
The Boys’ commons were fixed on a low scale. Their dress 
was a matter of special interest : the Founder evidently delighted 
in such questions. Their tabards* gave rise to the famous 
class of Taberdars, But even the Poor Boys did not complete 
the Founder’s plan. Thirteen poor men and women, the halt, 
the blind, the deaf and dumb, were to be fed daily in the College 
Hall; and broth, brewed according to Eglesfield’s directions, 
was to be given away at the College gate. 
Eglesfield drew a large and elaborate plan. But the College 
circumstances were far from permitting—they have in fact 
never permitted—its realisation in detail. The numbers on 
the foundation remained comparatively small. But additional 
classes of students soon grew up within the College. The Statutes 
offered little encouragement to strangers; but almost from the 
beginning, it seems, there were lodgers or pensioners paying 
rent for rooms, of whom one at least bore Wycliffe’s name. 
Almost from the beginning legends speak of visitors still more 
illustrious, of Edward the Black Prince and wild Prince Hal.* 
1 Dr. Rashdall (II, 497) thinks they had “ no positive claim or even 
preference.’ But the wording of the Statutes (Queen’s, 31) surely implies 
that some preference was given them. 
2 Eight pence a week, besides alms—small payments perhaps for 
attending services in memory of dead benefactors (Stats., Queen’s, 30, and 
Magrath, I, 48). - 
*“Indumenta corporis cum collobiis protensis ad medium tibie” 
(Stats., Queen’s, 31, and Magrath, I, 47-8). The name Taberdar may not 
have been much used before the seventeenth century, but gradually it 
was reserved for a senior class, It came to be applied to B.As. only: 
the requirement to this effect laid down in 1821 only re-stated, surely, 
what had been an older custom. Eighteenth-century entries in the 
College records suggest that the position of the Poor Boys and Taberdars 
was modified from time to time. The nineteenth century dispensed with 
residence for Taberdars. (See, among other references in Dr. Magrath’s 
volumes, I, 138, n.,and II, 112,138, 147-8.) But it should be remembered 
that these early terms and descriptions of students were often more or less 
fluid and loosely applied. 
« The question of Prince Henry is dealt with later. It is not of course 
impossible that the Black Prince should have visited Queen’s as a boy,

THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 273 
From an early date servitors existed.1 Commoners and Battelers 
appeared. In 1552 we hear of twenty-one undergraduates, 
with two Bachelors and ten Masters. But some twelve years 
later the College list includes thirty Commoners, besides the 
Provost; the Chaplain, the ten Fellows, and a dozen Taberdars, 
servitors and Poor Boys.* Half a century later, if Twyne’s 
figures may be trusted, the Commoners have increased to a sur- 
prising extent.? Fellow-Commoners, Gentlemen-Commoners or 
Upper-Commoners came up also, rich young gentlemen who 
opened their purses to secure from poorer students such services 
as fags might give at school. Some had servitors assigned to 
them at College, to do their “little businesses” for them. Some 
brought up tutors or attendants who joined the College as 
servitors. William Lancaster, the Provost who rebuilt the 
College in the days of Queen Anne, first came up with John 
Lowther, an Upper-Commoner of 1670, and matriculated ‘as 
batler”’ there. Sir Joseph Williamson, one of the great bene- 
factors of the seventeenth century, entered as a Batteler in 
1650, became a Taberdar in 1653, and a Fellow four years later.4 
The Queen’s Statutes are the earliest to speak of studies, corners 
portioned off the sleeping-chamber which two or three Fellows 
shared, little compartments, perhaps five to six feet square, 
furnished at times with desks and seats and shelves. The 
Queen’s customs have always had an interest of their own. For 
. festivals there were special regulations. A boar’s head, adorned 
with banners, became a traditional Christmas dish. On New 
Year's Day the Bursar presented each member with a needle 
before he went abroad in 1345: we have no College accounts to refer to 
before 1348. But there is no evidence for the tradition at all, and the 
alleged portrait introduced long after was said at one time to reproduce 
the features of an Oxford butcher boy. Walter Burley, once of Merton, 
is the Prince’s traditional tutor. But Edward may well have been 
interested in the College. 
1 Roland or Rowland Byres, Provost in 1426, first appears in 1407 
among the sevvientes (Magrath, I, 138). Walter Bell, his predecessor, 
began as a Poor Boy in the same year, and was a Taberdar in 1413-14 
and Provost in 1421.

*The reference in Twyne is XXI, 514. This gives Queen’s 194 
Commoners, and brings up the total numbers of the College at that date 
to 267, exceeding Magdalen (246) and Christ Church (240) which come 
next. No other College in this list has nearly so many Commoners, 
though Brasenose is credited with 145 and Exeter with 134. Dr. Magrath 
(I, 237, and 358) accepts this list. Twyne adds up his figures wrongly, 
but his statement in regard to Commoners is clear. On the other hand 
his list of 1611 (p. 513) allots only 150 students to Queen’s, and students 
ought to include Commoners. I doubt the figure 194. In 1651 Langbaine 
makes the College total 160 (Found. of Univ. 7).

and thread—a play upon the Founder’s name *—with the words 
“Take this and be thrifty.” The advice, little needed in the 
Middle Ages, may be more necessary now. If Eglesfield was 
only too generous in his solicitude for others, his sons have been 
better able to allow to his foundation an adequate proportion 
of the luxuries of life. 
Among early Provosts William of Muskham,; although a 
shadowy figure in the College history, contributed materially 
to its foundation. But the Black Death raged in Oxford as 
elsewhere, and for some years pestilence and poverty threatened 
the little Society’s existence. Henry Whitfield had a longer 
reign. But it ended in a curious quarrel, connected, it may be, 
with the methods of election in College rather than the prevalence 
of Wycliffite opinions. Whitfield and three Fellows who sup- 
ported him are said to have been expelled. The defeated party 
seized the College keys and seal and papers. An appeal to the 
Visitor was followed by an appeal to the Crown. King Edward 
died and King Richard intervened. But Whitfield subsided 
into an Archdeaconry and seems to have borne no grudge against 
his old colleagues. In 1363, before these troubles overtook him, 
the Provost had travelled to Avignon on College business. The 
details of the journey are still found in the College accounts. He 
had to buy his outfit in London. His gown and his large cape 
cost twenty-five florins. His boots cost three or four shillings. 
His horse and saddle, which he sold; brought four and twenty 
shillings in. His lawyers naturally cost him a good deal more. 
His journey back from Calais to Oxford cost-only seven shillings : 
but he took as many weeks to reach Avignon in going out.* It 
was in Whitfield’s day that the great John Wycliffe came to 
Queen’s to find a lodging.® Middleworth, ejected probably 
1The Aiguille and Fil represented Eglesfield—a less happy allusion 
than the eagle on the cover of the famous horn. Holinshed’s story that 
Henry V once in early days went to Court in a blue satin gown full of 
holes from which threads and needles dangled, is supposed to be one of 
the proofs that ‘‘ he was an academician of Queen’s”’ (Chalmers, Hist. of 
University of Oxford, 1, 192-3). 
4In 1379 (Magrath, I, 106, n.): but the accuracy of the entry is 
doubtful. Whitfield’s three supporters, Frank, Lydford and Trevellis, 
may have been, like two others mentioned with them, Middleworth and 
Trevisa, West Countrymen. It may have been a dispute over the election 
of a Provost: there is nothing definite to connect it with Wycliffe. See 
also Cal. Close Rolls, 1379 (258, 420 and 470).

with him from Canterbury College, became a Fellow there. 
Selby, also expelled from Canterbury, had rooms there.1 Nicholas 
Hereford, who took part’in translating the Bible, was a Queen’s 
man and conspicuous among the Reformer’s adherents, and the 
College, no doubt, provided others, though it provided some 
critics of the new doctrines too. 
Thomas Carlisle, the fifth or sixth Provost,? ruled from 1377 
to 1404,-and entertained still more conspicuous guests. The 
Earl of Northumberland, who was Hotspur’s father, Archbishop 
Arundel of Canterbury and the Bishops of Salisbury, Lincoln 
and Carlisle, appear in the Long Rolls among the visitors received 
with varying degrees of hospitality. The College accounts show 
sixpence spent on wine and bread for the Earl of Northumberland, 
and tenpence on wine for the Bishop of Carlisle. But when 
Henry Beaufort appeared as Bishop of Lincoln three shillings 
and sixpence was not thought too much for wine, and the College 
once gave a supper in his honour at which evidently no expense 
was spared. Royal Dukes also were made welcome. Thomas 
of Gloucester, Edward III’s youngest son, destined to die so 
mysterious a death, was entertained in 1392, and John of Gaunt, 
his elder brother, in 1393. The Lancastrian tradition had already 
begun. A certain ‘‘ Bewforth,” who is generally identified with 
Henry Beaufort the Bishop and the half-brother of Henry IV, 
had a room in College and a servitor to attend him in 1391, and 
“beuforth ’’ was a guest for whom wine was provided in 1395-6. 
A few years later Beaufort was Bishop of Lincoln and Chancellor 
of the University.4 In 1403 he became Chancellor of England, 
and in the next year Bishop of Winchester. Long afterwards 
he was a Cardinal as well. He is said to have had charge of the 
education of his famous nephew, and out of his relations with 
Henry and with Oxford there grew the tradition that he brought 
the young Prince as a boy to Queen’s. John Rous, a chronicler 
of little value, who died nearly a century later, stated that 
Henry V had studied at Queen’s College, under the care of his 
uncle Henry Beaufort, who was then Chancellor of Oxford, 
and had occupied a room over the entrance-gate. The College, 
as in duty bound, adopted the story, set up a proud inscription 
“Pensiones ” in 1374-5—‘‘ Item pro camera magistri Johannis Wiclife 
XXs.’’ See also ante (pp. 221-3).

But even for a tradition so attractive it is difficult to find much 
foundation in fact. Of Henry’s strong interest in Oxford and 
in Oxford men there is no doubt. But the records of his life 
which we possess make it difficult to see when he could have 
stayed for any time at Queen’s, and no contemporary biographer 
refers to the story. He was a boy of five or six when the Duke 
of Lancaster was received by the College in 1393. He was a boy 
of ten when Beaufort was made Chancellor. He was only eleven 
when King Richard carried him off to Ireland in May 1399. It 
is not impossible that he should have visited the College in his 
boyhood, and even have slept in the room over the gate. But 
it is difficult to believe that such a visit would have escaped all 
mention in the College records, and it is still more difficult to 
account for the omission if Henry ever came there after he was 
Prince of Wales. 
In the fifteenth century the pretensions of Archbishop 
Arundel gave trouble at Queen’s as elsewhere. He claimed not 
only the right of visiting the University, but special rights of 
visitation over Queen’s, and it was only after a struggle that the 
privileges of the Archbishop of York prevailed.? In 1413 it was 
thought well to secure the confirmation of the College Statutes 
by the Pope. There were visitations also of the plague. There 
were worthy but inconspicuous Provosts—Walter Bell, who had 
once been a Poor Boy, Rowland Byres who had once been a 
servitor, Thomas Eglesfield a relative of the Founder, John 
Pereson, who gave the College land and plate, including “‘ a nut 
harnessed with silver and with a cover of silver and gilt.” ® 
Henry Bost, who succeeded in 1483, was more important. He 
was already Provost of Eton, and he may have brought good 
1 See Wood (Colleges, 153) and Ingram (Memorials, I, Queen’s College, 
15). The tradition about Henry V at Queen’s is not of course an 
impossible absurdity like the legends about King Alfred and University 
College. But the evidence for it, when examined, is very slight. I have 
taken the traditional date, August 1387, for Henry’s birth. 
2 In the end Arundel yielded, but saved to himself “ the visitation of 
the scholars dwelling in the College, according to the judgment and decrees 
of King Richard and the present King.’’ (See Collectanea, III, Pt. II, 152-3.)

THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 277 
out of evil by becoming confessor to Jane Shore. In Edward 
IV’s day Eton, too closely associated with Henry VI, had to 
surrender the Priory of Monk Sherborne for the benefit of the 
College, and in Richard III’s day a property of some value 
bequeathed by a Westminster tailor came in.t Thomas Langton, 
thrice a Bishop and almost an Archbishop,* was made Provost 
in’ 1487, and was the first of his family to enrich the College. 
Christopher Bainbridge, afterwards Archbishop and Cardinal, 
was elected Provost in 1496, poisoned romantically at the in- 
stigation of an episcopal rival while serving as Ambassador to 
Henry VIII, and buried in a magnificent sepulchre at Rome. 
During these early years benefactions came in steadily, and 
among others Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter, maintained 
the Lancastrian tradition by leaving the College a chest of a 
hundred pounds. The Long Rolls contain many interesting 
details bearing on the College life. We have charges for “ save- 
naps” or bibs, for ‘‘ schynkyl,” shingle, for the repair of the 
Chancel, a Library charge of five shillings for the Subtle Doctor 
upon Porphyry, entries of sevenpence for rushes, of threepence 
for moss to bind the walls, of sevenpence for one labourer to 
prune the vines, of elevenpence for another to pull up nettles. 
We learn that Provost Bell lived in an upper chamber at the end 
of the Hall, that three shillings and fourpence were spent rather 
significantly on arrows about the time when Archbishop Arundel 
was causing trouble.? And there is no lack of information about 
the expenditure in entertainment of the College guests. 
The records of the sixteenth century are not much more 
eventful, in spite of the changes in the world outside. Provosts 
Rigg and Pantre and Denys, who saw Henry VIII and his three 
children ascend the throne in turn, seem to have been but little 
affected by the troubles of the day. Denys indeed was accused 
of defending Lady Jane Grey’s title; but he contrived to hold 
his place from 1541 to 1559, though the changes under Queen 
Mary, if not under King Edward, must have had their influence 
on the College. The early years of the century saw great im- 
provements in the College buildings. There is one significant 
entry in the Long Roll of 1535-6, a charge of twenty shillings 
and fourpence for expenses in the kitchen for “the Visitors of 
our lord the king, namely doctors Tragonwell and Layton.” 
But the College was for the most part absorbed in its own business, 
in the expulsion of a Fellow named Tyffyn, which led to the

before the appointment took effect.

intervention of the Visitor in 1542, in the seditious practices of 
another Fellow named Ralph Rudd, who had made himself 
Principal “‘ of a hall called Edmund Hall, wherein neither learning 
nor lesson is frequented.” - Queen’s contributed four Fellows 
to the new foundation of Trinity, and bore its share of the ex- 
penses occasioned by the Visitation of Cardinal Pole. Elizabethan 
changes produced a rapid succession of Provosts between 1559 
and 1565.1 Provost Hodgson may have resigned “ for religion 
sake’ in 1561. But he must have been a party to the payment 
of four shillings and eightpence “ pro destruendo altaria’”’ a year 
or two before.? John Boste, who was expelled later on for his 
opinions, and died as a Catholic martyr in 1594,3 was not the 
only Romanist to leave the College. Provost Francis, Queen 
Elizabeth’s physician; a medical man from Christ Church, may 
have owed his unpopularity in part to his Protestant opinions. 
But the stubborn opposition, which soon led to his withdrawal, 
may have been due as much to the interference of the Queen. 
Provost Shaw, his sticcessor, had no religious difficulties, only 
drink and mismanagement, to account for his disgrace. There 
is not much to note before the accession of the two great Provosts 
with whom the century ends. But benefactions still came in, 
and numbers were intreasing. Nicholas Myles, Vicar of St. 
Bride’s, in London, an old Fellow who was subsequently murdered, 
left the College a manor, and proyided a Lecturer in Sophistry 
and Dialectic at a stipend of twenty-six shillings and eightpence 
a year. William Fetteplace, a name well known in Oxford, 
bequeathed some lands iti Berkshire. And Archbishop Grindal 
founded one Fellowship and two Scholarships in connection with 
the School which he established at St. Bees. The College ordered 
the Archbishop's portrait to be painted, at a cost of thirteen 
shillings and fourpence, in return. , 
With Henry Robinson, elected Provost in 1581, and Henry 
Airay who succéeded him eighteen years later, as Elisha suc- 
ceeded to Elijah, the College entered on a great period of its 
career. Robinson, a former Taberdar, had been Principal of 
Edmund Hall since 1576, and showed himself from the first a 
man of character and power. 
“Invenit destructum, reliquit extructum et instructum.” 
He enforced the Statutes and regularised the practices of the 
College. He restored to it the emoluments from copyholds and

heriots, from reliefs and fines, which previous Provosts had 
treated as their own. He secured Letters Patent for the in- 
corporation of the College and a new Charter to make certain 
of its property and rights.1_ He saw to repairs and improve- 
ments. He rebuilt God’s House at Southampton. Fellows 
and Commoners increased. College Lecturers in Greek and 
Rhetoric appeared. Registers were established and an Entrance 
Book begun.? Robinson was called on to give help outside the 
College, in revising the University Statutes, in the selection of 
authorised preachers. He was a notable figure in Oxford, and 
when he passed on to the Bishopric of Carlisle he was fortunately 
succeeded by another capable Provost. Henry Airay, once a 
Poor Boy, devoted his life to the College interests. He continued 
the building operations. He fought for and maintained the 
right of Queen’s to nominate the Principals of Edmund Hall. 
On James I’s accession he went to Court to make sure of the 
patronage of the new Queen: there had been no Queen-Consort 
in England since Henry VIII's persistent efforts to fill the place. 
But Airay was best known in Oxford as a preacher and as the 
leader of the Calvinist party. As Vice-Chancellor he called 
Laud to account for a sermon at St. Mary’s in 1606. His views 
and character made his College very popular for a time. Before 
he died in 1616, it is said to have been the largest in Oxford, and 
to have had nearly two hundred Commoners on its books. 
Another North Country man, Barnabas Potter, succeeded 
Airay, though Archbishop Abbot proposed some one else. He 
too had been Principal of Edmund Hall, and he too became 
Bishop of Carlisle. He had daughters to whom Herrick ad- 
dressed verses. He had a nephew Christopher, who became a 
Court Chaplain and Provost of Queen’s, like himself. Barnabas 
Potter’s reign was prosperous and uneventful. Christopher 
succeeded in 1626 at a quiet time, and soon had the satisfaction 
of obtaining from the King, “ chiefly through the intercession 
of Queen Mary the Patroness of the College,” the advowsons of 
six livings in Hampshire. One of four contemporaries, known 
as Potter the Wise, Potter the Grave, Potter the Fool. and Potter 
the Knave, Christopher took pains to promote religious teaching. 
But his Court connections may have helped to draw him away

3 Under Christopher Potter also the College determined in 1634-5 
that no member of the Foundation should proceed B.A. till he was of 
five years’ standing, nor M.A. till he had been four years B.A. It also 
re-asserted its right to nominate Principals of Edmund Hall (Magrath, I,

  280 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
from the Puritan party. He became a strong supporter of Laud, 
and when the clouds gathered he “‘ suffered much for the King’s 
cause.” In 1640 he came into conflict with the Puritans, and 
was summoned before the Long Parliament. In 1642 he sent 
to the King four hundred pounds for himself and eight hundred 
for the College. Parliament ordered his arrest. The College 
plate went to the Royal Mint.1 Queen’s men had to pay for 
the King’s soldiers, and to work on the fortifications with the 
rest: they complained that the Magdalen men did not do their 
share. Richard Rawlinson, one of the youngest Fellows, drew 
up a remarkable plan for the fortification of the city. Other 
Queen’s men like Sir John Stawell, who raised five regiments 
for Charles, and Sir Timothy Fetherstonhaugh, who was taken 
prisoner and beheaded; were inevitably drawn into the great 
struggle. Sir Edward Hungerford was a General on the Parlia- 
mentary side. On Potter’s death, in 1646, another conspicuous 
Royalist, Gerard Langbaine, succeeded—a distinguished scholar, 
a friend of Ussher and of Selden,? who had acted as Keeper of 
the Archives with admirable results since 1644. It was a de- 
pressing time for Cavaliers. Langbaine had to face the Parlia- 
mentary Commissioners in 1648, but he was allowed to keep his 
place. The answers to the Visitors made by some of the Fellows 
excelled in circumlocution. They found it’strangely ‘‘ abstruse, 
ambiguous and difficult” to decide what the powers of Parlia- 
ment might be. But in spite of the attitude and the record of 
the College, the number of expulsions seems in the end to have 
been unusually small. Langbaine must have shown both ability 
and discretion. The Puritan traditions of an older day and 
influential friends like Selden may have helped to protect the 
College. 
Langbaine soon made his peace with the authorities and 
regained control of his College. He was invited to join in pro- 
posals for University reform. He defended the rights of the 
University against the city. He was ready, if needed, to defend 
them even against the Visitors of Cromwell. His firm, judicious

handed over to the King.

* It is not clear that Langbaine submitted, as Prof. Burrows thought. 
But he kept his place, as did several other Fellows at first threatened with 
expulsion. In the end the expulsions were singularly few, even less, it 
seems, than the seven suggested by Burrows—the smallest number which 
he gives for any College. Compare his Register of Visitors (74-9, 542-5 
and 571) with the details given by Dr. Magrath in his Ninth Chapter, In 
1660 also the same conciliatory spirit seems to have prevailed.
-P-A-G-E-322
  
THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 281 
conduct served his colleagues well, and he was, no doubt, willing 
enough to support the efforts of the Puritan rulers to restore 
work and discipline, to enforce morality and worship in the 
Colleges at large. Barlow, who replaced Langbaine in 1658, 
was equally successful. He had been Bodley’s Librarian since 
1652. He shared Langbaine’s learning and his Royalist opinions. 
He excelled him in the gift of making friends with those in power. 
Anthony Wood, though he owed something to Barlow’s kindness, 
found it difficult to pardon his facility in this respect, and there 
is little doubt that Langbaine was a stronger man. But Barlow 
played a leading part in the Oxford of the Restoration: always 
useful and acceptable, he had too many friends to be ignored. 
The College prospered under his rule. Well-known names 
appeared upon its lists. Joseph Williamson, who had come up 
from Westminster School and entered as a Batteler in 1650, 
mounted, with the help of Sir Edward Nicholas and Arlington, 
to a great place in the State: William of Orange could hardly 
listen with patience to his despatches, but Pepys judged him 
to be “a pretty knowing man’’: and he proved not only a 
generous benefactor but a powerful friend of the College. Lady 
Hungerford, the widow of the Parliamentary General, bequeathed 
a thousand pounds for Exhibitions, Charles II and his wife 
visited Queen’s, and their portraits were set up on the walls, 
together with pictures of Henry V and Cardinal Beaufort. 
Barlow became Bishop of Lincoln in 1675, but he rarely visited 
his episcopal city. He wrote freely and on many subjects. 
His plea for toleration was probably sincere. But in the days 
of the Popish plot he was conspicuous in denouncing Papists 
and in arguing that the Pope was Anti-Christ. Charles II’s 
death altered his opinions. He made himself notorious by his 
subservience to James, and in 1688 he had some anxious moments 
before declaring his devotion to King William. 
Timothy Halton, elected Provost in 1677—Barlow did not 
resign immediately on. being made a Bishop—kept up the North 
Country tradition. He filled office after office in the College— 
varied, it seems, by a brief experience of diplomacy with William- 
son abroad—and he lived to reign over it for twenty-seven years. 
He was a vigorous ruler, an active Vice-Chancellor, who was 
not afraid to protest against the mischief done by His Majesty’s 
players in Oxford, or to enter taverns in person and punish the 
scholars found there. One so discovered, Henry Fleming, cer- 
tainly no tavern-haunter, may be taken as a type of a Queen’s 
student in Halton’s day.1_ The son of a North Country squire,

seventeenth century. Of Daniel Fleming, who was there 1650-1652, we

he came up in 1678 with “ designs on the foundation,” entered 
as a Batteler and paid comparatively low fees. His battels 
for the quarter varied: but he paid five pounds for caution- 
money, ten shillings a quarter for “ tutorage,”’ six and eight- 
pence for his bed-chamber and study, two and sixpence to the 
barber, two shillings each to bedmaker and laundress. He 
shared a room with another student, and he had to do a little 
furnishing on his own account. After a year or so he became 
a Poor Child. His studies included logic, ethics, arithmetic, 
Euclid, Greek, Latin and Hebrew. He wrote “ collections,” 
made verses, took his part in declamations and disputations. 
He took his Bachelor’s degree and was elected “ Tabiter’’ in 
1682, but the cost of the treats he had to give was very small.* 
After that he devoted himself largely to theology, to qualify 
for the living of Grasmere which was in his father’s gift. Halton, 
if on one occasion severe to Henry Fleming, seems to have been 
a liberal and successful Provost. His noble Library began the 
rebuilding of the College, which his successor, William Lancaster, 
was to carry out. 
Many names of interest and celebrity are to be found upon 
the books of Queen’s. Richard Pace, Colet’s successor at St. 
Paul’s, may have been sent to Queen’s by Thomas Langton, 
before he went abroad with Cardinal Bainbridge, and learned 
to serve Wolsey and Henry VIII. Robert Langton, the old 
Provost’s nephew, was a conspicuous benefactor of the College. 
Bernard Gilpin, the “ Apostle of the North,’ was a Fellow in 
the middle of the sixteenth century. Sir John Davies, a high- 
handed lawyer by profession but a poet of note even in Shakes- 
peare’s day, matriculated in 1585. Sir Henry Wotton came on 
in the following year from New College, and wrote a play while 
an undergraduate at Queen’s. Thomas West, first Governor 
of Virginia, who gave his name to Delaware Bay, and Sir Thomas 
Overbury whose sinister tragedy shocked the worthless Court 
of James I; were members of the College before the sixteenth 
century closed. Three figures famous among their Oxford con- 
temporaries may also count with the Elizabethans—John 
Rainolds, Hooker’s tutor, who migrated from Corpus, but 
returned there as President in 1598, Thomas Jackson, who was 
President of Corpus later; and Henry Wilkinson the elder, best 
known in Puritan times. Great names of the North Country, 
do not hear much, but of his son Henry there are many details. (See, 
among other references, Vol. I, 250-5, 258, 262, 288-0, 304, 306, 313-15; 
Vol. II, 15-16, 27-9, 73-4, 80-2, etc.) 
1It should be added that a Commoner’s expenses, for battels 
especially, would probably be higher than Henry Fleming’s. Henry 
Brougham, for instance, about 1657-8 paid more. But the difference is 
not great (Ib. I, 107-8, and Magrath’s history, II, 31-2).

Lowther and Eden, Musgrave and Fleming, appear in the records 
of the seventeenth century, beside other names well known in 
English history like Lucy, Digby, Coventry, Lenthall, Acton, 
Fetteplace. John Bankes, a great Chief Justice, and Edward 
Nicholas, a faithful Minister of Charles I; came up when King 
James was on the throne: the State Papers still preserve for us 
Latin verses which young Nicholas sent to his father from Ox- 
ford and letters which his sister Susan wrote to him at Queen’s.? 
Sir Thomas Myddelton was a successful Parliamentary General. 
“Eternity ’’ Tipping—he rashly wrote a discourse on the subject 
—was one of the Parliamentary Visitors after the War. Michael 
Hudson, King Charles’ plain-dealing Chaplain, who died for his 
master, was almost a figure of romance. Thomas Crosfield, 
elected a Fellow under Christopher Potter, has left in manuscript 
in the College Library a valuable diary of the stirring times he 
saw. John Owen, famous even as an undergraduate for his 
character and learning, proved a great Vice-Chancellor under 
Cromwell. Thomas Lamplugh, a very different figure in the 
Oxford of the Restoration, rose, by methods which Wood stig- 
matised as cringing, to the Archbishopric of York: and Rush- 
worth won a place in history by the Collections he compiled. 
Bridgeman and Michel are seventeenth-century names connected 
with valuable benefactions to the College later. Lancelot 
Addison, a Batteler in 1651, gained notoriety as Terre Filius 
by a speech which he had to retract upon his knees?: and 
Joseph Addison followed his father at Queen’s before passing 
on to Magdalen where his memory lives. Thomas Hyde and 
“Rabbi” Smith were both book-lovers and distinguished 
Orientalists. Edward Norris, Member for Oxford, and Henry 
Compton, Bishop of London, were among the first in the great 
Revolution to declare for William of Orange. Sir Robert South- 
well, five times President of the Royal Society, was not only a 
successful official but William Petty’s and John Evelyn’s friend. 
Edmund Halley was an eminent astronomer, who printed and 
perhaps suggested the Principia of Newton. Wycherley, whose 
wit gilded the brazen manners of the Restoration, lived in the 
Provost’s Lodgings, “‘ philosophiz studiosus,”’ for a time: and 
even Haines the actor, for whom he wrote parts, and whom 
Pepys praised as an incomparable dancer, may find mention in 
the long list of Queen’s men, beside the statesmen, lawyers, 
doctors, controversialists, divines.

attack on Puritanism—in a Congregation of July 1658, according to Wood’s 
account (Life, I, 256). Lancelot Addison may have owed his Deanery at 
Lichfield afterwards to the influence of Sir Joseph Williamson, and to the 
same source Joseph Addison may have owed his name.

  284 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Before the close of the fourteenth century the site of the 
College was well defined. The outlying grounds stretching 
North and East to the town wall, which Eglesfield had secured 
but which were of little value after the plague of 1349, had passed 
into the possession of William of Wykeham. But the College 
property extended Southwards from the large house bought by 
Muskham opposite St. Peter’s Church, and included a line of 
shops upon the High Street.1_ The garden ground behind these 
shops became available for building, as the old dwellings adapted 
first for College purposes fell out of use, and here, not far from 
the South-east corner of the property, the Chapel was begun 
about 1364. The Vicar of St. Peter’s in the East had to be paid 
for the parishioners he lost, and to this day the payment is 
maintained. The College accounts preserve many details of 
the expenditure. We have the names and wages of several of 
the workmen: the masons’ labourers received in summer nine- 
pence halfpenny and in winter elevenpence a week, the masons 
themselves a good deal more. There are entries for stone and 
glass and straw and nails, for wine and oil, for vestments and 
for candles, for service-books, for rushes on the floor. We hear 
nothing of ‘“‘organs”’ before 1429. The Chapel was licensed 
and practically finished about 1382, but it was not formally 
consecrated and completed for nearly forty years more. The 
same period apparently saw a Library built, also on the South 
side but a good deal further West. Bishop Rede of Chichester, 
a generous friend to many College Libraries, contributed from 
1372 onwards to its fabric as well as to its shelves. A window 
with an effigy of Robert Bix, a Fellow of Wycliffe’s day who left 
the College silver spoons, was noted by Wood in the Library 
later, though originally, it seems, intended for the Chapel.2. The 
Long Rolls of the latter years of the century have entries in 
regard to bindings, chains and fittings. St. Thomas, Duns, 
Bradwardine, Gregory, Augustine were among the grave manu- 
scripts which the Fellows read. Provost Whelpdale bequeathed 
books in 1423. Archbishop Grindal and Christopher Potter 
contributed later. A catalogue of 1663 proved to be rich in 
1 As well as a few shops fronting East upon the lane. The property 
at the corner of the lane and the High Street was secured in 1497. The 
College possessions gradually spread West along the High Street: the 
most Westerly, ‘‘ Drowda Hall,” for over six centuries the property of 
University College, was not acquired till 1908. (See Mr. Salter’s Appendix C 
to the first volume of Dr. Magrath’s history.)

to the many details quoted by Dr, Magrath in his full notes from the 
College accounts.

manuscripts, though not in early printed works. A new Hall, 
on the West side of the growing quadrangle, was still being built 
when the fourteenth century closed. Muskham is said to have 
contributed to it,t but he died many years before it was ready 
for use. By that time also the “ ancient kitchen ” was removed, 
and kitchen implements were being freely purchased. Both a 
summer and a winter buttery existed. The great gateway had 
arisen opposite Edmund Hall, on the site of the shops acquired 
in Eglesfield’s lifetime. It must be remembered that the 
original College had no buildings on the High Street, but faced 
East and was entered from the lane. Chambers grew up beside 
the gateway and elsewhere: a Chamber Roll of 1418 speaks of 
them in various parts of the College. The Provost’s quarters 
were South of the Hall.* A fuel-house, a hen-house, a stable, 
a well, and remains, no doubt, of other old tenements and gardens, 
added to the picturesque variety which the eighteenth century 
resolved to sweep away. 
Benefactions and the needs of the College added to these 
early buildings as time went on. . Provost Langton built new 
chambers North of the gatehouse. His nephew, Robert Langton, 
built in Wolsey’s days a spacious Ante-Chapel, West of the old 
Chapel, which more than doubled its size, and which, joining 
the corner of the Provost’s Lodgings, shut off the Library into a 
little court of its own. Robert Langton also introduced fine 
glass. This is preserved in part in the present Chapel windows,* 
and when the troubles of the seventeenth century were approach- 
ing, Abraham van Linge set himself to rival or eclipse it. Lang- 
ton’s generosity also helped to beautify the Choir, the Library 
and the Provost’s chambers.5 Wolsey’s arms found a place in 
1 Money may have been collected for many years (Jd. I, 81). Musk- 
ham’s gift of 160 marks seems to have been intended for something more 
than repairs to the original dining-room. 
2 There are details about a gate in the Long Roll of 1348 (Magrath, 
I, 342). 3 On the West side of the quadrangle. ‘‘ Camera supra parluram cum 
parlura et studio et solario, per annum XLs. debet hoc anno nihil quia 
inhabitatur per prepositum ”’ (Magrath, I, 84, n.). The Library lay further 
to the South and West, and must have been partly hidden by the Lodgings. 
See Loggan’s print: Bereblock’s drawing is rather misleading. 
‘Ib. (II, App. G). Van Linge’s work has also been re-set in the 
present Chapel. It was probably all in the old Ante-Chapel in at least 
seven windows, dated 1635. (See Grinling, Ancient Stained Glass, Oxf. 
Architect. Soc., N.S., IV, 111 sg.) 
5 It was to Robert Langton that the bay-window on pillars, shown in 
the corner of the quadrangle in Loggan’s print, was due, and not, as Wood 
thought, to the Provost. It bore the Langton coat of arms, which is now 
over the door of the passage leading from the Provost’s garden into the 
street (Magrath, I, 166-7). For Langton’s brass and others see Vallance 
(Old Colleges, App. I).
-P-A-G-E-327
  286 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Langton’s windows, and possibly Wolsey’s Italian workmen 
may have helped to lay the Chapel tiles. Two or three genera- 
tions later, under Provost Robinson and Provost Airay, more 
building was required. Work was done on the roofs of the Hall 
and the Lodgings. In 1602 a “ novum cubiculum ” appears in 
the accounts. Other entries speak of the cost of the ‘‘ new 
structure.’”’ Seats were needed for the Fellows’ garden. The 
wood-yard and the cellar were repaired. Under Charles I there 
was again more building: we hear of “‘ nova edificia”’ in 1628. 
Walls were raised and demolished about the ball-court and the 
gardens. Muskham’s original house, no doubt, had long van- 
ished. The North side of the quadrangle and the enclosures 
beyond it must have taken their shape. After the Restoration 
Provost Barlow, restoring the old order in the Chapel, added 
some stained glass. He set up pictures of Henry V and Cardinal 
Beaufort in the room over the porter’s lodge, and he probably 
procured the pictures of Charles II and his Queen, for the carriage 
of which three shillings were paid. He may conceivably have 
kept an eagle in the College—if he could reconcile it with the 
spirit of the Statutes: five shillings and threepence was spent 
on work to shut it up.? 
At any rate in Barlow’s day Sir Joseph Williamson began 
his benefactions. A silver trumpet to summon the Fellows to 
dinner—Barlow thought that, to summon men on ordinary occa- 
sions “to a mess of pottage and twopenny commons,” the old 
brass trumpet was enough 2—a silver basin to hold the boar’s 
head at Christmas, a beautiful silver porringer for the Provost’s 
use at the high table, and even silver-handled knives, were added 
to the College treasures. In 1672 Williamson spent some seven- 
teen hundred pounds on a new building which, extending North- 
wards from the North-east corner of the old quadrangle, formed 
the East side of another court. This is fresh and conspicuous 
in Loggan’s picture, and alone of the buildings which Loggan 
represented now survives.? Later still Williamson bequeathed 
his books and his rich heraldic manuscripts to the College, and 
six thousand pounds which formed the nucleus of the fund for 
rebuilding it all. And it may be that Williamson’s example 
encouraged Provost Halton in his large designs. Wren and 
Hawksmoor were taken into council. Great schemes for im- 
provements began to appear. In May 1692 the foundation-stone 
was laid of a magnificent new Library, North-west of the old 
+“ Operculum fabricanti ad concludendam aquilam domini prepositi 
5s. 03d.’’—a, curious entry, if, as on other grounds seems probable, the 
eagle was of wood. (See Magrath, II, 38, =) But one must allow for 
College humour. Ib. (46, n.).

quadrangle. The ancient buildings, though Hawksmoor pleaded 
for their workmanship, were doomed. Medieval Queen’s was 
suddenly to vanish, but the tale of its destruction and replace- 
ment belongs to the story of a later time. 
The greatest of the fourteenth-century Colleges, and the 
greatest founded till then in Oxford, was the last. Few figures 
are more typical of medieval England, of its fine purposes, its 
practical achievement, its shortcomings mingled with noble 
effort and ideals, than that of the celebrated Bishop, who built 
himself in Winchester and Oxford memorials with which few 
monuments of Kings can compare. Humbly born and simply 
educated, William of Wykeham was appointed in 1356 clerk of 
works to the Crown. He was put in charge of Edward III’s 
great building plans at Windsor, and soon made his value felt 
as a master of business, if not as a master of architectural design. 
Rewarded with ecclesiastical preferments, he became the most 
conspicuous pluralist of his day. His abilities won the King’s 
favour so quickly that in 1365 Froissart declared that “ all thyng 
was done by him and without him nothinge done.” ® He was 
no less fortunate in securing the friendship of the Black Prince. 
The Great Seal and the splendid Bishopric of Winchester crowned 
an important and lucrative career.4 And even his political 
failures, the revolt of Parliament against ecclesiastical mis- 
government, the strictures of Wycliffe and the hostility of John 
of Gaunt, could not for long deprive him of power. Under 
Richard II he was again raised to the Chancellorship, and played 
a prominent if reluctant part in the dangerous counsels of the 
King. Henry IV’s usurpation left him unmolested, not the most 
forcible, but alike in his strength and in his weakness the most 
representative, ecclesiastic of his age.

2His father was a poor freeman of Wickham in Hampshire. His 
mother seems to have had some gentle blood. The Bishop was very 
likely trained as a notary. Apart from brief and early manuscripts, 
valuable accounts of the Bishop’s life and workare given in the biographies 
by Bishop Lowth and G. H. Moberly, in Walcott’s William of Wykeham 
and his Colleges, in A. F, Leach’s History of Winchester College, in the first 
chapter of Dr. Rashdall’s and Mr. Rait’s history of the College, and in

  288 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
It was in November 1379 that William of Wykeham issued 
his charter for a College of seventy ‘“‘ poor and indigent scholar 
clerks,” to form with their Warden the new ‘“Seinte Marie 
College of Wynchestre in Oxenford.”1 Oriel was an earlier 
College of St. Mary, founded half a century before. Already the 
Bishop had purchased for his Scholars a good deal of property 
in the town, mostly in St. Peter’s parish and in the desolate 
empty space near the town wall.2 A certain number of old 
Halls and tenements, a Maiden Hall and a Chimney Hall among 
them, occupied the site. But a great part of it was garden 
ground, and some of it was waste land with an unsavoury repu- 
tation, where, in the words of a fifteenth-century Chancellor, 
“filth, rotten corpses and intestines of corpses and almost all 
the refuse of the University were thrown,’’* where thieves and 
malefactors sheltered, and where, it may be, a plague pit had 
been dug. The town owned part and made the Bishop pay a 
heavy price for it.4 Other owners, St. John’s Hospital, St. 
Frideswide’s, Oseney, Godstow, Littlemore, Queen’s College, 
proved easier probably to deal with. The purchases began in 
1369. Papal Bulls securing privileges for the future College 
began in 1371. The Bishop’s influence was strong and his great 
wealth made endowment easy. Lands in Oxfordshire, Bucking- 
hamshire, Berkshire, Wiltshire, Essex and Norfolk came in— 
including an Essex church which had long been the property of 
the Hospital of St. Bernard in the Alps, The Bishop’s vigour 
carried through his plans. Even before 1376, when a political 
crisis overtook him and forced him to break up his household and 
to send his Oxford Scholars away, he had established students 
both at Winchester and at Oxford.’ Some of the Oxford lads 
lodged at Hart Hall, where the earliest Scholars of Exeter had 
1 Wood (Colleges, 181). The Royal license to found the College and 
hold land in mortmain is dated June 30, 1379. But Wykeham had 
scholars in Oxford before that. 
2 One of his early purchases, however, was New Inn Hall, on the other 
side of the town (Rashdall and Rait, 27). 
3 See Magrath (I, 339, n.). 
« £80, though the jury found it was worth only tos. a year (Ogle, 
Royal Letters, 334-9; see also 75-8). It was set down as 3 roods. But 
Mr. Salter points out that medizval measurements exaggerate and would 
make the site of New College over ro acres instead of less than 5. Mr. 
Salter gives a clear account of the property acquired in 1370 by the Bishop 
from Queen’s College, stretching West from Hammer Hall, which stood 
on part of the site of the present cloisters and North of Temple Hall. 
The latter, or its site, was also secured by the Bishop in 1392, (See 
Magrath, Queen’s College, I, App. C.) 
5 A School at Winchester existed long before Wykeham’s day, and 
Wykeham had students there before 1376 apparently. (See Moberly’s 
Life, 108, and Leach’s Hist. of Winchester, 63 and 67.)
-P-A-G-E-332
  THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 289 
lodged before. In March 1380 the foundation-stone of the new 
College buildings was laid. In April 1387, Wykeham’s Scholars 
moved from their temporary quarters, and singing a solemn 
litany took possession of their stately home. And though already, 
as the Bishop lamented, there had arisen among them conten- 
tious spirits, who “erected their necks on high” and suggested 
‘‘odious comparisons of nobility to ignobility, of science to 
science, of faculty to faculty, of country to country,” there must 
have been in their minds a comfortable conviction that no other 
Oxford College, not even Queen’s with its large design or Merton 
with its wealth and beauty, could in scale or in splendour compete 
with their own. 
The Statutes, based to some extent on those of Merton, but 
far more elaborate and detailed,! were revised by the Founder 
more than once. It was not till the year 1400 that they took 
their final shape. The new College of St. Mary at Oxford was 
to include a Warden and seventy Scholars or Fellows, ten priests 
or Chaplains, three stipendiary clerks, and sixteen boy choristers 
to serve in the choir. Founder’s kin had preferential claims to 
Fellowships,? and the inhabitants of certain districts where the 
College had possessions. But the distinctive feature of Wiliam 
of Wykeham’s great establishment was that he provided another 
College for younger boys at Winchester, from whom his Oxford 
Fellows were to be drawn. Instead of the limited arrangements 
for teaching younger students which Walter of Merton and 
Robert of Eglesfield had planned, William of Wykeham arranged 
for the boys who profited by his munificence to be educated in 
a great grammar school at Winchester first, to secure there the 
grounding in Latin which was often so inadequate and yet so 
essential for University students, and after that to spend two 
years on probation at New College before obtaining the full 
status of perpetual Fellows. Of the seventy chosen—poor, 
indigent scholars‘ between fifteen and twenty years old, of good 
manners, conversation and condition, sufficiently instructed in 
grammar, and able and anxious to learn—no fewer than twenty 
were to study Civil or Canon Law. Any deficiency in this number 
Arts students of less than three years’ standing must supply.’ 
1In the Statutes of the Colleges of Oxford (1853, Vol. I) the Merton 
Statutes of 1274 occupy 15 pages, those of New College 116. 
3 Founder’s kin, among other privileges, escaped the period of probation 
and could be elected up to the age of 30 (Statutes, Rubs, 2 and 6). 
* The Founder probably expected even perpetual Fellows to pass on 
in time to benefices or employments, or else to a College living. (See 
Rashdall’s and Rait’s New College, 51-2.) But they stayed on at New 
College longer than at Merton, it seems. 
“ An income exceeding 5 marks disqualified for election, or one exceeding

-P-A-G-E-333
  290 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Two Fellows might study astronomy, and two others medicine. 
But medical study in Oxford was still precarious, and the Founder 
required his medical students, if the University provided no 
Regent in the subject, to turn to the study of theology instead. 
For the rest, after a full Arts training, theology was to be the 
paramount aim. Vacancies among the Fellows were filled by 
an annual examination held at Winchester by the Warden and 
two Fellows, who at the same time inspected the School. 
New College was founded by a Conservative Churchman, who 
was unusually alive to the needs of education, but who was also 
a deep believer in ceremonial religion and in the value of inter- 
cession for the dead. To pray for the soul of the Founder was 
no less a duty than to train men for service in the Church or in 
the world. Daily prayers for College benefactors, daily masses 
in the College Chapel, weekly processions round the College 
cloister, were provided for with elaborate detail. Ecclesiastical 
observances had increased since the days of Walter de Merton. 
The rule of daily attendance in College Chapels had begun. But 
the rules for encouraging learning were more original and almost 
as complete. Five Deans were to supervise studies.2_ Frequent 
disputations in Hall and Chapel were required. A new and 
valuable provision, the real beginning of the Oxford tutorial 
system, put all the younger students at New College under the 
charge of tutors ® whose services the College paid. A hundred 
shillings a year were set aside for the purpose. All Fellows 
were expected to take degrees * and Orders: in the case of poor 
students the College contributed towards the cost of degrees.® 
1 Yet we hear of only one sermon a year (Rub. 43), and there is no 
provision for the religious instruction of boys who were intended to be 
priests. 
2 And with some other of the senior Fellows they apparently carried 
through an examination for the Bachelor’s degree (Rub. 26). 
3“ Informatorum ” (Rub. 28), who supplied the personal teaching 
which young students needed. 
4 But they were not allowed, as a rule, to apply for Graces to dispense 
with the conditions for a degree. Out of this a curious abuse arose. 
When such Graces came to be asked for as a matter of course, New College 
men, who did not seek them, were thought to be specially exempted from 
the necessity of asking for them. And when University examinations 
came in, New College men, who had their own examination, claimed to be 
exempted from these too. The theory had unfortunate effects on New 
College education. (For this interesting suggestion of Dean Rashdall’s, 
see his Universities, II, 507-8, and New Coll. 153-5.) King’s College, 
Cambridge, claimed the same privilege (Peacock, Observations on Cambridge 
Statutes, App. A). 
5 These allowances, varying from 13s. 4d. for Responsions and Deter- 
mination, to 26s. 8d. for Inception, are said to be “‘ pro vestibus, furruris, 
et aliis eorum necessariis in hoc casu,”’ and later “ pro necessariis suis 
sumptibus et expensis que circa premissa ipsos facere oportebit (Rub. 27).
-P-A-G-E-334
  THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES = 2gr 
A high standard of effort and discipline was enjoined upon them. 
A great ecclesiastical and academic corporation was to preserve 
the old traditions but to meet the new needs of the time. 
Hand in hand with a certain grandeur of conception went 
minute regulations for the Fellows’ daily life. The Founder’s 
Statutes are exceptionally long. The allowance of a shilling a 
week for commons might rise to one and sixpence if the price of 
corn went very high. A Steward of the Hall was appointed each 
week among the Fellows to superintend the purchases of food. 
Liveries were provided, varying in pattern and degree: junior 
Fellows came in for old suits after four years’ wear. Eccen- 
tricities in dress, peaked shoes, red and green hose, long hair and 
beards, were severely discouraged. Fees or salaries were allotted 
for special services to certain Fellows.1 Quarrels were to be 
settled—the Founder was very much alive to the possibilities 
of quarrelling—by the Vice-Warden, Deans and others: Warden 
and Visitor were only called in for difficulties of a graver kind.? 
The Bishop of Winchester was appointed Visitor, but his powers 
were closely limited by the Statutes.* Latin conversation was 
enjoined. The Bible was read during dinner. Only on great 
days would the Scholars gather round the fireplace to indulge 
in songs or poetry, to discuss “‘ the chronicles of kingdoms or 
the wonders of this world.’ 4 There was to be no habit of 
lingering in Hall after meals. Guests must not interfere with 
studies: no stranger must pass a night in the College. Strife, 
scurrility and base talk were prohibited, unseemly sports, illicit 
games, inordinate leapings and wrestlings and tumults and noise. 
Books were provided in the Library, some to be circulated, some 
to be chained. New College Scholars rose early. They had to 
walk out two and two together, if they walked abroad. Three 
or four of them shared a chamber, but each had a bed and a 
1The Vice-Warden received 53s. 4d. a year, each of the five Deans 
and also each of the three Bursars 13s. 4d., each Tutor 5s., each Fellow 
in Priest’s Orders doing duty in the Chapel a sum not exceeding 4os., 
each of the ten Chaplains 4 marks, with an additional mark for the one 
who acted as Sacristan, each of the three Chapel clerks 20s. There were 
also small fees for members of the College who attended memorial services 
for the dead. (See Rubs. 13, 14, 28, 30, 43, 45, 49.) 
2 But minor offences might be punished by the Warden (Rub. 34). 
And a Papal Bull of 1398 exempted the College from all other 
prelatical jurisdiction (New Coll. 32-3). 
“Dr. Boas thinks (University Drama in Tudor Age, 10), no doubt, 
rightly, that Wykeham sanctioned the festival of the Boy Bishop. ‘* Per- 
mittimus quod pueri vesperas, matutinas et alia divina officia, legendo et 
cantando dicere et exequi valeant, secundum usum et consuetudinem 
ecclesie Sarum ”’ (Rub. 42). 
* Hawks and hounds and dice and chess are specially forbidden, and 
“that most vile and horrible game”’ of shaving beards on the eve of 
Inception (Rub. 25).

  294 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Chapel was a graceful Cloister,! a burying-place for members 
of the College, and a new encroachment on the rights of Oxford 
parish priests. Beyond the Hall was a garden, defended by 
the old town bastions, to supply food and later on recreation 
for the Fellows. At the East end a gate in the town wall led 
into the Slype, the slip of ground outside it. Another gate, close 
to the Church of St. Peter, was opened only when special cere- 
monials or necessities required.? 
The Chapel, unique among the Chapels of Oxford, recalled 
and challenged the great Chapel at Merton. Its form, a choir 
and transepts only, became the favourite form for Oxford College 
Chapels. Its stately reredos, in place of an East window, its 
ancient screen gates which are used to-day, its rich stained glass, 
its ornament and sculpture, its glow of colouring on walls and 
windows, lent it a splendour which many may regret. An organ 
was set up in 1458 in a loft supported by wooden pillars. The 
glass condemned by Edward VI’s Visitors was spared till the 
College should be rich enough to replace it. But under Elizabeth 
it was taken down, the fine work of the reredos was sacrificed, 
and the East end was covered with a plaster wall. Laud’s day 
saw some revival of old glories. But after the surrender to the 
Puritans the organ was destroyed, and the gilding and painting 
probably suffered again. The Restoration brought back the 
desire for colour and for ceremonial music. At the East end a 
“frame of wainscot’’ was erected. Painting and gilding re- 
appeared. The idea of restoring the fine old reredos does not 
seem to have occurred to anyone. But a new altar-piece, repre- 
senting “ the Concave of a Semi-Rotunda in the Ionic Order,” 
pleased the early eighteenth century with its ‘‘ wonderful Effect.” 
A new organ was set up, “sweet and musical,’”’ of which parts 
still survive. The old glass, saved from the rancours of the 
Reformation, still shines in the windows of the Ante-Chapel in 
tones which even Reynolds’ followers could not match.* Of 
the monuments on which Wood loved to linger some beautiful 
1 It is difficult to see how the choir-school found space to exist between 
the East cloister and the West wall of the Chapel (Wood, Life, I, 49). 
No wonder that it was found “‘a.very inconvenient situation”; Ingram 
adds that about 1694 one of the Masters obtained leave to instruct his 
scholars in the old Congregation House at St. Mary’s (Mems., New Coll., 
21-2). Yet Wood’s statement seems precise and he was taught there. 
There is just space for a small and narrow room. It may have been short- 
lived: I can find no trace of it in Chaundler’s pictures of New College 
(Chaundler MS., Roxburghe Club).

to inspect the fortifications (Statutes, Rub. 65).

Reynolds made cartoons. On New College glass see Mr. Grinling’s paper

brasses remain.t But most of the brasses in the Cloister were 
“sacrilegiously conveyed away’’ when the King’s ammunition 
was stored there in the barbarous days of civil war. 
The Hall, the oldest in Oxford if Merton’s claims be dis- 
allowed, was completed in 1386.2 It was enriched with panelling 
under the Tudors—by Archbishop Warham, if the tradition be 
true. The ancient blazons still decorate the windows. The 
arms of Wykeham, Warham and Gardiner mingle with devices 
prouder yet. A portrait of the Founder, with his two Colleges 
on either hand, bears the inscription : 
“Qui condis dextra, condis collegia leva, 
Nemo tuarum unam vicit utraque manu. 
Manners makyth Man.” 
The Library, at the East End of the quadrangle, was a part of 
Wykeham’s scheme. It soon overflowed into more rooms than 
one. The Founder gave it two hundred and forty manuscripts.* 
Archbishop Cranley gave it others. Later benefactors helped 
to enrich it. _Warham’s books and Pole’s books found their 
way there.¢ Five hundred printed volumes came in 1617 from 
Bishop Lake. Other large donations followed, and from gifts 
and fines and degree-money an annual income was built up. 
The law-books were housed originally over the Chequer or 
Bursary. But later on, when a third storey had been added 
to the quadrangle, they were removed to the Manuscript Library 
above, and in the days of the Popish Plot the old Law Library 
was converted into a Common Room, where the Fellows could 
discuss in leisurely security the scares and follies of the world 
outside. The Chequer below this chamber was also appropriated 
to the seniors’ use, and in due time the junior members of the

69 ft. high. Dean Rashdall and Mr. Rait (New Coll. 81, n.) and Mr. 
Prickard (New College, in College Monographs, 28) give rather different 
figures. Mine are given me by the College Bursary. 
* Of which only twenty-seven remain (New Coll. App. K). Mr. Leach 
has printed a list of the books given by Wykeham (Collecianea, III, 
213-44), and he points out their heavy cost, estimated in modern money 
—tising to something like £53 for Augustine’s De Civitate Dei or for Albert 
the Great On Vegetables, and even higher in certain cases. Comparatively 
cheap books like Cicero’s Rhetoric and Boethius’ Arithmetic were worth, 
at the same estimate, £4 or £5 of our money. 
“See Dr. M. R. James (The MSS. at Lambeth, 11). Bishop Rede of 
Chichester, who is credited with gifts to several College Libraries, is known 
to have given books to New College, and so is Bishop Walter Skirlaw of 
Durham (Hist. MSS. Comm. 2nd Report, 135, and New Coll. 250): they 
died respectively in 1385 and 1406. Rede’s gift of ‘‘ 50 precious books 
of Theology and canon law ”’ is recorded in his will in Twyne (XXIV, 107).

296 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
College secured in the new quadrangle a Common Room for 
themselves.?_ Externally the introduction of attics in the reign 
of Queen Elizabeth was the first interference with William of 
Wykeham’s design.? But the attic windows were not allowed 
to show inside the quadrangle, and it was not till a hundred years 
later that a third storey definitely appeared. The walls of the 
quadrangle were carried up for the purpose, and new square 
windows inserted throughout. Encouraged by these depreda- 
tions, and no doubt needing more space, the College decided in 
1682 to begin a new quadrangle on the garden side. And in 
course of time the gardens beyond it, once reserved for kitchen 
uses, became a place of refreshment and delight, with their 
sixteenth-century mound, their seventeenth-century hedges, 
their eighteenth-century iron screen, and behind them a back- 
ground which belongs to all the centuries, stamped with the 
beauty which only time can give. 
The great days of the Schoolmen were over when Wykeham’s 
Scholars entered into their inheritance. It was lawyers and 
ecclesiastics rather than philosophers that the new College set 
itself to train. Two Archbishops, Chichele and Cranley, are 
among the earliest Fellows whose presence is recorded in the 
Hall. Chichele lived to found another College. Cranley was 
Warden in 1389 *—he had previously been Warden of the College 
at Winchester—was Chancellor of Oxford and Chancellor of 
Treland, and Archbishop of Dublin for some twenty years. While 
at Oxford he was an important figure in the University. He lies 
before the altar of the Chapel of his College, but his fine brass is 
in the Ante-Chapel now. Wycliffism took no strong hold of 
Wykeham’s Scholars; though one or two of them were burned 
as heretics under Henry VI. The type represented by Cranley 
and Chichele, and by Bishop Bekynton of Bath and Wells, the 
Secretary and Minister of Henry VI; who has left his monument 
in his Cathedral city, was the type which Wykeham may have

Mr. A. O. Prickard’s little Monograph on New College, Oxford, 
illustrated by Mr, E. H. New, has an interesting description of the College 
buildings. 
* He is third in the list of Wardens given by Rashdall and Rait (232-3). 
Richard de Toneworth and Nicholas de Wykeham are there given as the 
first and second Wardens under date 1377 and 1379. I know of no 
evidence that Nicholas Wykeham was Warden in 1374 or 1375, though 
Rashdall and Rait suggest (37) that the letter given in Lowth’s Life of 
Wykeham (App. X),and mentioning N. Wykeham as Warden, was written 
at that date. But Mr. Leach (Winchester College, 67), to whom they 
refer, dates it 1388. Some of the statements made about Cranley also 
(New College, 91) seem to be inexact, Few of the early College Wardens 
were conspicuous men,

THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 297 
wished to mould, statesmen conspicuous both in politics and in 
the Church whose high places they adorned. Bekynton with 
his influence and his great reputation proved a valuable ally. 
He secured a suppressed Priory and several manors for the 
College. And under his friend and correspondent Thomas 
Chaundler, who was Warden from 1454 to 1475, the educational 
tradition was well maintained. Chaundler was perhaps a little 
fulsome towards Bekynton. But he became a leader in the 
University. He opened a new field of distinction to his College. 
He made it one of the earliest homes of the New Learning. He 
wrote, it has been said, the best Latin prose of his generation, 
and under him the Latin taught at New College was the best 
Latin of the day. The Greek taught there by the Italian scholar 
Vitelli was the first Greek taught in the Oxford of the Renaissance. 
The scholarship learned there by Grocyn, the son of one of the 
College tenants and afterwards the holder of a College living, 
placed him among the famous teachers of his time. And though 
the lead in the new movement passed to Magdalen, New College 
still kept its reputation up, and Warham, one of the last repre- 
sentatives of the old order in England, represented also the 
learning which Colet and Erasmus loved. 
But it was the old order, redeemed by education, for which 
New College stood. Through the Middle Ages it went on its 
way, studying, dreaming, dozing, entertaining, producing some- 
times prelates or officials, enjoying great preferments in the 
Church. In 1418 the ‘‘ Ambassadors of our Lord the Pope” 
were made welcome with wine and spiced bread and beer. The 
Ambassador of Burgundy came in 1426. There was talk of a ~ 
visit from Henry VI. There was a feast for Bishop Waynflete 
later. The College gave a famous Headmaster to Winchester 
and Eton ; it gave Eton also a Provost who saved it from spolia- 
tion by Edward IV.? It gave a Lord Chancellor, Bishop Russell, 
to Richard III. It gave Magdalen a President, who is credited 
with some share in negotiating the marriage of Catharine of 
Arragon, which was to have such astonishing results. It gave 
more than one Bishop to the Bench, including an Archbishop 
of Dublin, a contemporary of Wolsey, who bore the old Oxford 
name of Inge. Few of the medieval Wardens rose to fame. 
1 Chaundeler seems on the whole to be the spelling preferred in 
Registrum Aaa. But Chaundler, Chandler, Chandeler are variants. 
There are no rules for medieval spelling, and even the distinguished 
authors of the little history of New College spell Bishop Bekynton’s name 
in more ways than one. For Chaundler’s writings on Wykeham and on 
other subjects see the beautifully illustrated Chaundley MS. which 
Dr, James has edited for the Roxburghe Club. 
2 The Headmaster was William Horman, author of school-books and 
a friend of William Lily; the Provost William Westbury (New Coll. 98-9).

  298 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
But John Young, elected in 1521, was not only Warden, but 
apparently an Archdeacon, a Dean, a titular Bishop, and Master 
of the Rolls at the same time. And in the days of the Reforma- 
tion Warden London, another unblushing pluralist, proved an 
unblushing time-server as well. Beginning life as “ the rankest 
Papistical Pharisee,” he fell with a heavy hand on the early 
Oxford Reformers, and is said to have starved one of them to 
death ‘in the steeple.” The dying man summoned strength 
to tell his friends that he could take no food but a pie of Wardens 
baked, ‘‘ and so after his prayers sleapte swheetly in the Lorde.”? 
London found it necessary to propitiate Cromwell with presents 
of gloves and partridges and geldings, and for all his forcible 
adroitness he had trouble in securing obedience from his Fellows. 
He became one of Cromwell’s Commissioners. He joined in 
Layton’s Visitation. He assisted the spoilers who in ‘ the great 
quadrant Court’’ of New College scattered the leaves of Duns 
Scotus and other “ barbarous dreamers”’ to the winds. London 
was certainly no fool, and he was also no enthusiast for the 
~Reformation. When Cromwell fell he became the instrument 
of Gardiner’s severities. But it is satisfactory to know that his 
unscrupulous methods brought him to the pillory and to prison 
in the end.? His successor, Henry Cole, succumbed in the same 
way, after similar efforts to satisfy both sides. Cole was quite 
ready to submit to King Edward, and to acquiesce, it seems, in 
the startling changes proposed by the Visitors of that day, which 
would have robbed New College of its law-students in order to 
create a College of lawyers at All Souls. But he became a 
conspicuous agent of the Marian reaction, and played his part, 
a most ungenerous part, at Cranmer’s death. 
Finer spirits, wedded to the old faith and active in the days 
of Queen Mary, fled into exile when the Reformation finally 
prevailed. Thomas White, indeed, appointed Warden in 1553, 
contrived to keep his place for twenty years. But Catholics bred 
in Wykeham’s two Colleges were conspicuous among the exiles 
gathered at Louvain and Douai. Munden,* a Fellow ejected 
at the Visitation of 1566, became a Jesuit and suffered at Tyburn: 
Sanders became Professor of Theology at Louvain, and died 
when acting as Papal representative in Desmond’s rebellion in 
Ireland. John and Nicholas Harpsfield, both vigorous defenders 
of the old religion, suffered deprivation and imprisonment when 
their cause went down. Thomas Harding, said to have been

  THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES — 299 
nominated in King Edward’s day as Warden, but a strong 
Romanist later, gathered Wykehamist refugees round him abroad. 
Bishop White of Winchester, an old Fellow of the College, fell 
into disgrace by reminding Elizabeth, when preaching Mary’s 
funeral sermon, that a live dog was better than a dead lion. Each 
change of ecclesiastical authority threatened Visitations and 
expulsions, but for a long while the Catholic element at New 
College held its own. 
In 1566-7, however, Bishop Horne’s Visitation took place. 
It. was carried through with systematic thoroughness, and it 
produced many charges of irregularity and misconduct.1_ Some 
Fellows, it was suggested, would subscribe to anything. Some 
were accused of heresy, some of mocking at religion, some of 
violent tempers and abusive language. There was ample 
evidence of neglect and disorder in the College. Services were 
avoided. Latin talk was dropped. Only three of the choristers 
had ever been taught to sing. The Warden in particular was 
accused of loose morals and lax administration. He pleaded 
guilty to charges of taking presents, of maintaining a big house- 
hold, of keeping dogs in College, of telling his Fellows too freely 
what he thought about them. But he was quite as ready with 
serious charges against his accusers, and their good faith was 
probably quite as doubtful as his own. The crimes alleged were 
strangely mingled. Wearing a yellow doublet and dancing in 
suspected places were as much talked of as heresy, adultery and 
dishonesty of a serious kind. The punishments included com- 
purgation, and may seem as light and uncertain as some of the 
offences. The Bishop did his best to check these abuses. His 
Injunctions laboured to enforce the Statutes. Certain members 
of the College were suspended for refusing to subscribe to the 
Articles of Religion. The Visitor’s chief object probably was 
to put Popish practices and religious disobedience down. Later 
Visitations dealt more with points of conduct, with gaming, 
drinking, fighting, with buying of places, with petty peculations, 
with the stealing and pawning of books. Bursars took com- 
missions from the tradesmen? and claimed the dripping as a 
perquisite of their own. Bold spirits protested that the Visita- 
tions went too far,? and Horne’s severity was resented by the 
1 Of this Visitation, of those which followed it in 1576, 1585 and 1599, 
and of the Injunctions which resulted from them, Rashdall and Rait give 
a careful account (115 sq.). 
2 See the account of Bishop Billson’s Visitation in 1599 (New Coll, 141). 
The reappearance of monitions in regard to the use of the surplice, 
which Horne had resorted to before, indicates the growth of Puritan 
feeling.

Fellows. But Horne’s successors in the latter years of the 
century found it necessary to intervene again, to. check mis- 
conduct, to repress corruption, to prevent the abuse of the 
benefits which William of Wykeham had bequeathed. 
Warden Colepepper, another fortunate pluralist, ruled the 
College from 1573 to 1599. In his day ‘‘ the incomparable pair 
of brethren,’ Pembroke and Montgomery, the friend of Shakes- 
peare and the patron of Vandyck, are said to have come up as 
Commoners, aged respectively twelve and eight+; Sir Henry 
Wotton was for a short time a Gentleman-Commoner living 
outside the College; and the Fiennes family established their 
doubtful claim to the privileges of Founder’s kin.2 Warden 
Lake, who left to become an admirable Bishop, was succeeded 
in 1617 by Robert Pinke, whose long reign was destined to cover 
a memorable period of Oxford history. Benefactions continued 
to flow in. Fifteenth and sixteenth century prelates, Bishop 
Bekynton of Wells, Bishop Russell of Lincoln, Bishop Shire- 
bourne of Chichester, who established ‘‘ Wiccamical Prebends ”’ 
there, Cardinal Beaufort and Archbishop Warham, were among 
the donors who gave gifts or founded Exhibitions for the College. 
Wardens like Lake and Pinke and Woodward later kept the 
generous tradition up. The College pride perhaps grew with its 
possessions ; undergraduate Fellows claimed to wear tufts or 
tassels in their caps and to sit in the Bachelors’ seats at St. Mary’s.3 
James I paid a brief visit to the College in 1605.4 He was enter- 
tained ‘with a royal feast and incomparable musick.” But 
His Majesty has been accused of leaving a tradition of drunken- 
ness behind. James summoned to Court and exposed the 
ingenious impostor Richard Haydock, a Fellow who practised 
physic by day and claimed to be inspired to preach sermons in 
his sleep at night. Laud stepped in to reprove excesses like 
2 If they matriculated, as stated (Reg, of Univ. ed. Clark, II, ii, 195), 
in March 1593, William Herbert (Pembroke) was under thirteen, and 
Philip (Montgomery, and Pembroke also later) was under nine. They 
died respectively in 1630 and 1650, and it is a mistake to suggest (New Coll. 
193) that either succeeded in 1661 or served on Cromwell’s Council, though 
the younger served for a short time on the Parliamentary Council of State. 
2 Founder’s kin sometimes constituted one-fourth of the Fellows 
(Ib. 157). Among other Elizabethans Sir Henry Sidney has been claimed 
as a member of the College in his youth: Christopher Johnson, Head- 
master, physician and Latin poet, and Thomas James, the learned 
Librarian of the Bodleian, illustrated the resources of the age. 
? On this and similar claims, see Rashdall and Rait (1 55-6). 
“I know of no authority for the suggestion of these two authors (150) 
that Queen Elizabeth visited the College in 1566. The total numbers in 
James I’s day, 1612, are put by Twyne (XXI, 514) at 130; he adds up 
the details wrong, and he mentions no Commoners, Langbaine puts them

long hair and slashed doublets among the younger Fellows, and 
to suggest that an undue degree of Calvinistic study was respon- 
sible for the failure of New College men in after life. But Warden 
Pinke was a lieutenant on whom the Archbishop could rely. 
He took part in revising the Statutes. He stood by the Chancellor 
in his efforts for discipline and reform. When the Civil War 
came, he was one of the first Heads to-risk the displeasure of 
Parliament and to exert himself to raise troops and defences for 
the King. He watched the Royalists drill in the quadrangle. 
He handed over the cloisters for a Royal magazine. A Loyalist 
of the old school and one of the last devotees of the old Scholastic 
learning, he did not survive the humiliation of his master. Soon 
after the Parliament triumphed in Oxford he fell down the steps 
of his Lodgings and died.t 
Lord Saye’s descent on the College in September 1642 was 
one of the first operations of the war. He showed no unnecessary 
roughness to his old College, but he ransacked the Warden’s 
study for compromising papers, as ia duty bound. After Edge- 
hill the tower and cloisters were given up to military uses. The 
choir-school, with little Anthony Wood among its scholars, was 
transferred to ‘‘a dark nasty room.” The College plate, all but 
a few cups and vessels, went to the Royal Mint.? The College 
sympathies, traditionally Conservative; must have been strongly 
on the King’s side ; even in 1647 its members made a bonfire on 
the Prince’s birthday and resorted to conspiracy when arms had 
failed. Its stout walls had their value in the fortifications, and 
in 1651 the Puritans prepared to defend the tower against Charles 
II. The Parliamentary Visitors found New College men stub- 
bornly malignant. Out of fifty members interrogated in May 4 
1In November 1647. Henry Stringer, and in 1649 George Marshall, 
succeeded as Warden. 
2 This has been questioned, but there seems to be no doubt about it. 
(See New Coll., App. D). The authors of the College history give in their 
Preface a useful account of the materials available, apart from those 
already quoted here, like the books on Wykeham and his Colleges, the 
Statutes (printed in 1853 from the Harleian MS. 1343 in the British 
Museum), and the many references in Wood (Colleges, Athena, Annals 
and Life), in the Second Report of the Hist. MSS, Commission, in Ingram 
(Memorials), the State Papers, D.N.B., etc. Among MS. materials 
in the College must be mentioned the Register of past members of the 
Society, which the late Warden compiled. Seven volumes of Evidences, 
copies of important deeds, were made under Warden Woodward. The 
White Book has interesting notes on early days up to 1456. The Bursars’ 
Rolls run from the foundation to 1638, and the Long Books follow from 
1651 to 1881. The books kept by the Stewards of Hall from 1387 to 
1544 give details of commons and guests. I have to thank the Warden 
for kindly allowing me to see these and to put some questions to him, 
and Mr, P. E. Matheson for his help,
-P-A-G-E-345
  302 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
1648 only one yielded unqualified submission.t Some con- 
descended to excuses; but many refused point-blank, and did 
not conceal their opinion that it would be tantamount to “ flatt 
perjury”? to yield. Over fifty recusants were sentenced to 
expulsion; and though the sentences passed were not always 
carried out, Dr. Stringer, whose appointment as Warden was a 
defiance of the Parliament, and a very considerable number of 
members were condemned. Stringer held on till the autumn of 
1649, and his successor, Warden Marshall, found some difficulty 
in enforcing Puritan ideals. There were tales of deep drinking 
among the Fellows. There were worse scandals among the 
Chaplains. There was a marked reluctance even to sconce 
gentlemen who absented themselves from the long Puritan 
prayers. The old evil of corrupt resignations, of paying to ~, 
succeed to places, cropped up again. New College did not alter 
its ways to conform to the new system, and the return of the old 
rulers brought no revolutionary change. 
Marshall’s rule did not survive the Commonwealth. Michael 
Woodward, who saw the Restoration, reigned as Warden from 
1658 to 1675. He too found the times difficult. The Fellows, 
he said, imposed upon him. Small-pox invaded the College. 
Bishop Morley’s Visitation in 1664 endeavoured to insist upon 
reform. Like Laud, the Bishop found the College wanting in 
distinguished men. The old obligation to take Orders was 
neglected. The. old standards of education and discipline were 
relaxed. The Chapel services had been restored immediately 
after the King’s return: but even in 1654 John Evelyn had 
reported that New College Chapel retained ‘‘ its ancient garb.” 
The admission of Commoners, non-foundation members, rare 
though not unknown before, and difficult to reconcile with the 
Founder's intentions, was now put on a recognised footing. They 
were allowed, contrary to the ancient practice, to live inside the 
College, and this rendered necessary a new quadrangle, for which 
the well-to-do new-comers might very properly help to pay. 
Woodward took a genuine interest in his College and left it many 
legacies. He seems to have been the last Warden for two hundred 
years who cared to study its documents and history.* His 
successor, Dr. Nicholas, was chiefly known as a Vice-Chancellor 
who did his duty “ hauling taverns.” And Henry Beeston, who   
      
1 There are traces, however, of others submitting. The head cook and 
barber were among those who yielded, but the under-servants were made 
of sterner stuff. The exact number of final expulsions is, as usual, hard 
to ascertain. Prof. Burrows thinks it might have been sixty or seventy, 
including servants: but I doubt if in the end it was nearly so high. (See 
his Register, 53-60, 195, 527-31, 571 and passim ; and see also New College, 
170 sq.)

became Warden in 1679, and who was a member of the famous 
Philosophical Society, was condemned by Wood as a courtier 
too ready to run with the times. The same shrewd critic found 
the College degenerate in learning, ‘‘ much given to drinking and 
gaming, and vaine brutish pleasure.’”’ It probably needed, as 
he said, a thorough reformation. Even the Warden’s Lodgings 
would have been exceptionally lively if his three and twenty 
children had accompanied their father there.+ 
Warden Pinke, among other good deeds, befriended an 
unfortunate Fellow of the College, who fell into debt and was 
imprisoned by Parliament, although one of the most learned 
astronomers of his time. As the contriver of the octodesex- 
centenary period, Robert Lydiat earned a line from Dr. Johnson 
and the awed respect of unchronological mankind. It is strange 
that a College invited to such studies should have devoted so 
much of its time to producing minor poets. Pinke is said to have 
offered a chaplaincy at New College to Peter Gunning, a devoted 
Royalist expelled from Cambridge, who rose to a Bishopric in 
later days?; and Morgan Owen, the builder of the fine porch of 
St. Mary’s, was a Chaplain of New College as well as of Archbishop 
Laud. Other notabilities of the seventeenth century included 
Nathaniel Fiennes, who surrendered Bristol to Prince Rupert, a 
Hyde who became Bishop of Salisbury, a Trenchard who became 
a Secretary of State, and Sir Edward Herbert, who proved 
an honest Chief Justice even under the auspices of James II. 
They included also two of the Seven Bishops, and Sir Richard 
Holloway, one of their judges. Ken went up to New College 
before the Restoration, and found it allowable to practise his 
music and to scatter his charities there. But, as the seven- 
teenth century proceeded; zeal and scholarship visibly declined. 
“Golden scholars’? might still come up from Winchester, but 
they were apt to deteriorate into “ silver Bachelors and leaden 
Masters ’’ before their course was run. It was not till a much 
later day that the era of reform began, and that William of 
Wykeham’s noble foundation, with its stateliness in building, 
its cost and curious workmanship, its comely form of govern- 
ment, not always proof against abuse, and its ample and honour-

a “faithful nursery of learned and able men.” 
1“ But,’”’ Wood adds in September 1683 (Life, III, 74), “‘ all are dead 
except three.’ In 1689 Lord Ashley declared that there was only one 
sober Fellow in the College, and he retired in that year (New Coll. 189-90). 
2 The authors of New College (168-9) mention that Isaac Barrow was 
also welcomed at New College by Dr. Pinke. But this was the elder 
Isaac Barrow, the uncle of the famous mathematician and divine.

late Warden’s Register (f. 189). Turner and Ken were the two bishops.

  304 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Canterbury Hall or College also dated from the fourteenth 
century, and would be entitled to a place between the Colleges 
of Eglesfield and Wykeham, had not time-and the tide of the 
Reformation swept its fame and its memories away. The monks 
of Christ Church, Canterbury, had at one time like other Bene- 
dictines a lodging ‘‘in the common manse of Black Monks in 
Stokwellestrete.” 1 But as early as 1331- they rented, for six 
marks, a house close to St. Peter’s in the East.2, Three young 
monks were sent from Canterbury to settle there. They left 
home with fifty shillings, spent thirty-seven on the journey and 
arrived with thirteen. The bailiff of the Convent’s property 
at Newington near Oxford was charged to see to their necessities, 
but was reminded, when one of the students died, that the two 
survivors did not need as much as the three. The Bishop of 
Lincoln licensed an Oratory for them. The Convent wrote to 
them about their studies, sent horses once to fetch them for a 
festival at Canterbury, kept a watchful eye on their affairs. It 
is difficult to say how long the little Hall lasted? The Black 
Death spared the Priory of Christ Church, but it swept away, as 
Archbishop Islip lamented, far too many trained and learned 
men. In 1355 the Archbishop reminded the Convent that it 
had no young students at the University left. In 1359 he asked 
leave for a monk to return there. In 136r he went further and 
secured a Royal license to found a new Hall or House at Oxford 
for a certain number of scholars both religious and secular.* 
The advowson of Pagham and the manor of Woodford were 
settled on it. Several little tenements on the North-east border 
of St. Frideswide’s were gradually acquired. In 1363, it seems, 
the Society took shape.’ Four monks were among its early 
1 They assigned it to Westminster Abbey in 1371. (See the document 
in the Chapter records, O, 139.) They may have used it when the settle- 
ment in St. Peter’s Parish ended, and very probably in earlier days. 
2“ Ubi solebat Dominus Archiepiscopus manere ’”’ (Lit. Cant. I, 392-3). 
Archbishop Mepeham, Mr. Salter suggests to me, might have rented it 
some thirty years before, while keeping terms for his D.D. 
2 It appears, from a letter printed by Dr. Sheppard (Jb. II, 266) and 
dated 1343, to have been in existence in that year. But the evidence is 
by no means conclusive. And if Muskham hought the house for Queen’s 
College in November 1341—it is identified by its wide gate—the monks 
probably withdrew soon after. 
¢ Ib. (II, 332, 386-8 and 409-10). The letters quoted by Dr. Sheppard, 
mostly from Register L, are in the Chapter Library at Canterbury. The 
Royal license (O. 127 among the Chapter documents) is dated October 20, 
1361, but misdated in the catalogue. 
5 See the documents of April, May and June, 1363, printed by Dr. 
Sheppard (Lit, Cant. II, 442-3 and 445-8). The Archbishop speaks in 
general terms of twelve students. Most authorities date Woodhall’s 
appointment as Warden 1362. But-it seems clear from Islip’s Register 
at Lambeth (192) that the date should be March 19, 1363.

members, and one of the Christ Church monks, Henry Woodhall 
or Woodhull, was appointed Warden.* 
Controversy soon arose between the monks and the seculars 
in the new College. Islip may have hoped that they would live 
together on an equal footing. That he originally intended the 
monks to have a governing voice was freely asserted and freely 
denied.2 But his health was failing and his intentions may not 
always have been clear. Or the monks may have shown them- 
selves too eager to secure control. At any rate in December 
1365 the Archbishop removed the monkish Warden and appoin- 
ted ‘‘ John de Wyclyve”’ in his stead.2 He made the little 
College into a secular Society. New Fellows, Middleworth, 
Selby and Benger, replaced the monks. And the Statutes 
drafted about this time* ran upon familiar lines. The Fellows 
were, as usual, to be chaste and honest, humble, peaceable and 
poor. There were rules for discipline and study, rules for the 
Chapel and rules for the Bursar. The Warden, chosen by the 
Archbishop from three presented to him by the Fellows, was to 
have ten pounds a year. Some attempt was made to limit 
entertainments in connection with degrees. There was to be 
a Library with a Chaplain as librarian, and a Hall with commons 
on a fairly liberal scale. But moderate abstinence was recom- 
mended, because it helped the intellect, as Daniel had found out. 
Older and younger Fellows were to sleep in the same chamber, 
to restrain insolence and stimulate high thinking in the young. 
All alike were to be members of a common family, and if all the 
family were secular, it was hoped that its members might not 
disagree. But Islip died in 1366. His successor, Langham, was 
a Benedictine, and the monks naturally took advantage of this 
circumstance to reassert their claims. Steps were taken to 
1 Woodhall was an Abingdon monk, a Doctor of Theology, admitted 
to Christ Church, Canterbury in March 1361. Was he brought there 
for the purpose ? (See Lit, Cant. II, 497.) 
* Mr. Cronin (John Wycliffe, the Reformer, and Canterbury Hall, Oxford, 
reprinted in 1914 from the Transactions of the Roy. Hist. Soc., 3rd Series, 
Vol. VIII), who argues ably the case for the monks, thinks that Islip 
intended the four monkish Fellows to govern the College and the eight 
secular students to be on a subordinate footing. But this assumption is 
difficult to reconcile with Islip’s language or with his action in 1365. And 
I think Mr. Cronin overstates the power of the Chapter to “ dictate ” 
terms to the Archbishop. 
3 On the reasons for identifying him with Wycliffe the Reformer, see 
ante (p. 222). 
4 Wilkins (Concilia, III, 52 sq.) dates the Statutes 1362-3. They are 
given in Islip’s Register at Lambeth (ff. 213-215), but without a date. 
I think Mr. Cronin establishes his point that these Statutes were only a 
draft prepared after Islip’s reorganisation of the College at the end of 
1365.

to Rome and a lengthy trial followed. In 1370 the Papal arbi-

CHAPTER VIII 
OXFORD IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY 
HE challenge which Wycliffe and his followers offered 
to the authority and abuses of the Church, created 
some prejudice against the Schools of Oxford, and may 
have helped to bring Cambridge into fashion. But the great age 
of the medieval University was over before Wycliffe’s ashes 
were cast into the Swift. The vivid life, the passionate enthusiasm 
of the earlier days gave place, it may be, to teachers less original, 
to ambitions less exalted, to complaints about the slowness of 
preferment, to tame compliance with the evils of the time. 
The old love of disorder was stimulated by examples on a larger 
scale outside. Numbers declined. The University wept for her 
lost students as Rachel for her children, but tears alone would not 
bring them back. The unpopularity of the Church in the country 
told against the whole community of clerks. Bishops “ lived 
high in the King’s Court.’ Livings appropriated to Monasteries 
were sometimes starved. Absentee Rectors neglected their 
duties, and ill-paid substitutes took their places. ‘‘ Those that 
had money had preferments though they were idiots and de- 
bauched.” 4 Complaints could not be repressed by high-handed 
acts of authority or by sending Lollards to the stake. The 
Great Schism in the Papacy shook the foundations of religion, 
Oxford indeed played her part with other Universities in trying 
to settle the long scandal. She urged the summoning of a 
General Council. Incidentally she supplied a third Pope when 
both existing claimants were condemned. But Alexander V, 
the only Oxford graduate, it may be, who ever sat in the chair of 
St. Peter,? proved as powerless as Gregory or Benedict to end 
the rivalries which divided Christendom, and the intervention of 
Oxford was of little moment beside the activities of the University 
of Paris. Even the English Nation in Paris, which had refused 
to bow to Avignon and had steadily maintained its independence, 
was merged in the community of German students, and before

FIFTEENTH CENTURY OXFORD 309 
the middle of the fifteenth century the old name had disappeared. 
At Caen a new University was established by an English King, 
and a Fellow of Exeter was sent over to rule it. But Oxford 
gained no real increase of influence from English victories in 
France. At home the ‘damnable’ Statute of Provisors 
had tended to stop the preferment of University men. The 
Popes, with all their insupportable pretensions, understood 
better than private patrons the importance of education in 
candidates for Church appointments. The Universities suffered 
when it was realised that a degree no longer led so quickly to 
aliving. The Lancastrian Parliaments recognised, like Richard II 
before them, the need of granting Oxford some measure of relief.? 
And in 1417 the Province of Canterbury adopted stringent 
regulations for securing benefices to men who had worked their 
way through a University course, and for reserving benefices 
of superior value for graduates who had won the superior 
degrees.® 
But the evils which Oxford had to complain of as the fif- 
teenth century proceeded were largely due to causes beyond 
the University’s control. The whole nation was suffering from 
the want of governance, from the exhaustion which followed the 
splendid and ruinous attempt to conquer France. The Lancas- 
trian kings appealed to public sympathy by their great adventures 
on the Continent and their constitutional experiments at home. 
And at first they displayed in no small measure the finer qualities 
of their race. If Henry IV proved in the end a rather perplexing, 
disappointing figure, after the romantic story of his early years, 
if the pressure of difficulties, ill-health and disillusionment changed 
a gracious, chivalrous, impulsive Prince into a politic, suspicious 
King, Henry V at least was singularly successful, and became 
in a rare degree the leader of the nation. All parties bowed 
before a Sovereign so just in conduct, so lofty in ambition, so 
wise in counsel, so superb in war. But round the lonely child 
he left behind him there gathered the accumulated troubles of 
his age and race, the breakdown of the people’s hopes and 
expectations, the ghosts of the sins of his fathers, and the grim 
inheritance of disease. 
1 In 1442, says Sir H. M. Lyte (333). But the change had begun before 
this (Du Boulay, V, 420-1). And in 1439 it seems that only a single 
Master represented the English or German Nation at Paris (Rashdall, I, 
549-50). 2In 1403 all graduates were exempted from the Statutes against 
Provisors, But the complaints went on. (See Lyte, 288-9, Rotuli 
Parliamentorum, III, 301 and 465, Rymer’s Federa, VIII, 339, Collectanea, 
III, 153, and Twyne, XXIII, 49). The fourteenth century is full of 
petitions for benefices addressed by the University to the Popes.

‘Woe to thee, O land, when thy King is a'child! ” 
Simple to the verge of foolishness, helpless beyond the record, of 
weak, Kings, the heir.of the greatest soldier in Europe only asked to 
spend his days in reading and devotion. As the years advanced 
and misfortunes crowded round him, friends, subjects and Ministers 
admitted his unfitness... The great Churchmen who had helped 
to establish his dynasty passed away., Not a few of them were 
closely, linked with Oxford—Arundel, who had anointed Henry IV.

into,Henry. V’s adventures, Beaufort, the wealthy and politic 
Cardinal who had loved Henry, of Monmouth but, could not save

and Chancellor, struggled long and honestly to support Henry VI’s 
unsteady throne... Waynflete, Beaufort’s successor at Winchester, 
and, like Chichele the Founder of an, Oxford College, won their 
master’s confidence and stood by him_staunchly in his last and 
most, miserable years, .But neither Kemp nor Waynflete could 
defend the poor King against himself. The Princes of Lancaster 
passed in.turn, pursued, by the evil fortunes of their family, and 
left no heirs. . Bedford died, and, his strength and sagacity. died 
with. him.;Gloucester lived some -twelve years. longer, long 
enough,to win himself a special place in Oxford history, and to, 
show himself too often incapable of either sagacity or strength, 
Discontent flared into rebellion... Jack Cade marched on London. 
Jack Sharp, who demanded the confiscation of Church property, 
had been, ‘“ dampned to the death before the Duke of Gloucester 
at Oxenforde’’ nearly twenty years before. The King’s health 
broke and York became, Protector. The Civil War destroyed 
the House of Lancaster, and taught men that the Yorkist Princes 
had both, cruelty and, cunning behind the popular gifts which 
brought them applause. Before the century ended the wheel 
went, round again, The field of Bosworth closed the thirty 
years of bloodshed which the first battle of St. Albans had begun. 
And a new generation, turning with relief to the security offered 
by the Tudors, began to look beyond the Schools of Oxford for 
new ideals of learning and of faith. 
Henry IV supported Archbishop Arundel’s authority in his 
struggle with the Oxford Masters who defied him, but in general 
he showed. himself the University’s friend. He presented it 
with a large gilt cross. He gave books and money to its Library. 
He ‘exempted its graduates. from the Statute, of Provisors, He 
remitted—all but.one penny—the yearly payment of a hundred 
shillings for the assize of bread and ale. He enlarged the

the Pope.t He once tried to nominate a Bedel, and he recom- 
mended candidates, sometimes unsuitable candidates, for degrees.? 
But the University again and again expressed its admiration 
of the Royal virtues *: it was only when circumstances changed 
and Henry’s throne was slipping from him, that the poor King 
had reason to complain of insult. Even then he was still strong 
enough, in 1459, to have the offenders, two Gentlemen Bedels, 
deprived of their offices and sent to prison.4 But academic 
politicians were deplorably ready to bend before the forces of 
the time. On Henry’s brief restoration, in 1470, they wrote with 
effusion to congratulate him on recovering his kingdom: it was 
undoubtedly Divine Providence at work. A few months later 
they wrote with still greater cordiality to congratulate the 
Sovereign who had dethroned him, offering their ‘“‘ infinite thanks 
to a most merciful God.’ 5 Edward received these protests 
with indulgence. He confirmed while he ignored Lancastrian 
Statutes. He spared the property of the Colleges, exempting 
them from the confiscatory legislation of the time.? He endowed 
a chantry at Windsor and gave the University the right to 
nominate the Chaplain. He founded or contemplated a lecture 
in theology. He visited Oxford and spent a night at Magdalen ; 
the Chancellors and Masters went out with “a multitude of 
lights ” to greet so successful and benevolent a Prince. Richard 
III enjoyed the same assurance of devotion, till Henry of Richmond 
replaced him on the throne. The Masters prudently got rid of 
a Chancellor, Lionel Woodville, who was too closely associated 
with Richard’s opponents. The new King also came to stay at 
Magdalen, and Waynflete, who had been one of the dead Henry’s 
dearest counsellors, found it necessary to offer Richard a welcome. 
A Sovereign who could appreciate the art of disputation, praise 
the eloquence of Grocyn and award the disputants a Royal 
buck apiece, was felt to deserve the University’s allegiance, at 
any rate until he lost his Crown. In 1484 the Masters of the

University rejoiced in Richard’s victories with a pleasure which 
His Majesty could hardly have believed. In 1485 they could 
not refrain from expressing to Henry VII their delight in his 
triumph. Richard’s conqueror seemed superior to Hannibal and 
recalled Alexander to academic minds.1 
But in spite of declining vigour and of brief, complaisant 
loyalties like these, Oxford was still a voice in Christendom. At 
Constance, in the early years of the century, Bishop Hallam, 
once an Oxford Chancellor, took the lead in demanding Church 
reform. At Basle later on, though the University, when invited 
to send delegates, grumbled at the cost,? Peter Payne, who had 
once been Principal of Edmund Hall, seized the opportunity 
to defend the views of Hus and Wycliffe? The University 
corresponded on ecclesiastical affairs with foreign Princes. It 
had powerful friends like Chichele and Kemp at Court. And in 
Oxford itself the fifteenth century, for all its shortcomings, was 
in some respects an age of growth. New Colleges were founded 
near St. Mary’s. A lovelier building rose beside the Cherwell 
beyond the East gate of the town. Above all, the University 
at last secured buildings of its own that were worthy of its fame. 
From the earliest days St. Mary’s Church, whatever changes 
overtook it, had been the centre of academic life. There the 
Masters met, their spokesmen were elected, their Chancellors 
and Commissaries sat. There degrees were given and disputa- 
tions held. There most of the University’s business was trans- 
acted and most of its property kept. But St. Mary’s, though 
used by the Masters from time immemorial, never belonged to 
the University. The Congregation House, built in Edward II’s 
reign by Bishop Cobham, in a little court behind the chancel 
of the church, was for generations the only building of importance 
which the University possessed.5 Neglect has long since fallen 
on this venerable structure. Its windows have been altered 
and darkened. Its meetings of Masters have been transferred 
elsewhere. Its space has been filled with broken fragments from

Virgin from the niche above the porch, whose head the Puritan 
soldier of the seventeenth century. shot off. The old home of 
the University in the heart: of Oxford has in turn been. treated 
as store-room, school-room, lumber-room and cellar. But neither 
time nor indifference can obliterate its interest or destroy the 
traditions: which its walls enshrine.t 
But: something better than the buildings of St. Mary’s or the 
Schools in, Schools Street were required in an age when most of 
the Universities of Europe were beginning to ask for more spacious 
quarters... Cobham’s. Library was growing too small for, its 
inheritance, The Church and the Schools. were. threatened, with 
decay. The tenements where the earlier Masters had, lectured. 
wereifalling down. In 1439 Abbot Hokenorton of Oseney built 
a new substantial range of lecture-rooms, which the Abbey. let 
to Masters for their use, and which became the chief Arts Schools 
of the University—the ‘‘new Schools’? of that day—till the 
time of James 1.2, In the years that followed. the ancient Law 
Schools also called for repair.? | And:long before that the Masters 
were collecting subscriptions for a far more magnificent design. 
The Divinity School was planned upon, a scale quite dispropor- 
tionate to the. University’s resources. It took more, than, a 
generation to complete it.. It took all the funds that persistent 
importunity could procure... In 1427, when, Thomas Chace of 
Balliol: was Chancellor, a site was secured from Balliol lying to 
the East. of Exeter College, at the North end of Schools Street 
under ‘the town wall.4: Bishops and, other dignitaries, Cathedral 
Chapters, the great Monastic Orders, in fact: all likely: patrons, 
were invited to subscribe... The Benedictines responded with a

Congregation House as 45 ft. by 20 ft.; Mr. Vallance (The Old Colleges of 
Oxford) makes it 45 ft. 9 in. by 18 ft. 8 in. A late Vicar of St. Mary’s 
in his account of the church thinks that the lower room was originally 
60 ft. long.) Sir T. Jackson discusses the statues in his history of the 
church, 
2 We hear of thirty-two schools in Schools Street in the fifteenth 
century, to which Determiners were restricted (Mun. Acad. 239-41: but 
the date’ may be later than 1409). Abbot Hokenorton probably pulled 
down some old Schools for his new stone building. The new Schools 
were let to Masters at 13s. 4d. each, and the Masters sublet them to 
Determiners (Wood, Ann, II, 759-60). 
* The Canon Law School in St. Edward’s parish was clearly University 
property in the sixteenth century: Dr. Rashdall thinks (II, 463) that 
both the Canon Law and the Civil Law Schools belonged at one time ‘to 
individual Doctors. But Mr. Salter identifies the Canon School with a 
house which the University acquired in 1279. (See his Note on University 
Tenements, Med. Arch. I,.275 sq.) 
«Tt must have been’a stretch of imagination which led the University 
in’ 1423 or 1424, when begging from the Bishop of Bath and Wells, to 
describe the building as “ already begun ” (Epist. Acad. 10).

love of literature, his open purse, and the gratitude of the many 
writers he befriended, secured for him the name of a gracious 
and generous Prince. Yet, if truth be told, the “ Good Duke” 
did little good outside the world of letters, and his reputation 
would have fared ill had he not found favour with churchmen 
and chroniclers, philosophers and poets. His chief merit, and 
no mean one, was his taste for books. He drew round him, 
like any Prince of the Renaissance, a court of scholars whom his 
liberality inspired. Italians of mark like Aretino and Candido 
Decembrio had reason, no doubt, to acknowledge his bounty, 
though it seems that they expected more than they received. 
Tito Livio,? the biographer of Henry V, was called Humphrey’s 
poet and orator. AZneas Sylvius attributed the eloquence of 
Englishmen largely to his patronage. A learned theologian like 
-Capgrave wrote the Duke’s life and flattered his intellect. 
Scholarly prelates like Abbot Whethamstede, who loved books, 
his monks said, better than business, and Bishop Pecock, whose 
ready pen ran him into heresy; were among Duke Humphrey’s 
friends. Poets like Occleve and Lydgate—the latter may 
possibly have had some Oxford training—led the chorus of 
appreciation.* Balliol tradition claimed Gloucester as a student. 
The University hailed him as its “ most singular protector,” ¢ 
most serene prince, most gracious lord. It appealed to him 
constantly for endowments and support. It lavished on him a 
tich vocabulary of adulation. He had brought the Greeks 
from the grave. He had unsealed the secrets of Africa and 
Asia. He was to Oxford what Cesar had been to the Romans, 
what Hector had been to Troy. And from one who knew Duke 
Humphrey even better we can learn all that his Usher and 
Marshal had to tell—how his Grace’s hair was combed, his 
breeches tied, his bath and slippers prepared for him, his table 
served, his pew in church attended to, and his Royal person 
cared for in still more intimate and peculiar details.5 
1Leonardo Bruni of Arezzo—Aretinus or Aretino—may have been 
introduced to the Duke by Zano Castiglione, Bishop of Bayeux. See 
Vickers (Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, 351 sq.), whose view is perhaps 
rather indulgent to Humphrey. For Candido’s correspondence with him 
see Eng. Hist. Rev. for 1904 (xix, 509 sq.). 
2 On Titus Livius de Frulovisiis, who came from Ferrara and “ indi- 
genated ”’ in England, see Jb. for r910 and 1915 (xxv, 58 sg.and xxx, 74 sq.). 
3 Lydgate has been thought by some a poet of genius little below 
Chaucer, and by others “a prosaic and drivelling monk.” Occleve’s 
confessions are more interesting than his poems, See Sir S. Lee’s article 
on Lydgate (D.N.B.) and estimates of both in Warton’s Hist. of Eng. 
Poetry (Sects. XX-X XIII) and Cambridge Hist. of Eng. Lit. (II, ch. VIII).

  FIFTEENTH CENTURY OXFORD 317 
The Duke’s library, his “ bien mondain”’ 1 was probably the 
most interesting collection in the country. It was not confined 
to theologians like Augustine and Ambrose and Albert the 
Great, to Isidore and Boethius and the text-books of the time. 
Great Schoolmen indeed like Scotus and Aquinas were missing. 
Classical books and secular literature took their place. Plato 
and Aristotle—Candido’s translation of the Republic, Aretino’s 
translations of the Politics and Ethics—figured beside Arabian 
works on astronomy and medicine. Bede was there, and 
Suetonius and Josephus, and other chronicles of a later day. 
Ovid’s Fasti and Metamorphoses, Seneca’s tragedies, Livy, Cicero 
and Pliny seemed to strike a newer note. One Greek book—a 
vocabulary—and manuscripts of Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio 
bore witness to the owner’s catholicity of choice. The cobwebs 
of the Schoolmen were losing their hold on the student: the 
breezes of the Renaissance were beginning to blow them away. 
The Duke’s physician, Gilbert Kymer, was a familiar figure 
in Oxford, where he acted as Chancellor for several years. He 
took a prominent part in building the new School. And tradition 
has credited him with securing the Duke’s treasures for the 
Library of the University which he loved.? 
Books in early days were costly treasures, and the first 
manuscripts which the University possessed were kept, with 
its other treasures, in St. Mary’s Church. Before his death in 
1327 Bishop Cobham of Worcester planned a Library to house 
them over his Congregation House, and drew up detailed instruc- 
tions for their keeping. He left both books and money for the 
purpose, but unhappily he left large debts as well. Adam de 
Brome came to the help of the executors, and paid down a 
1 There seems to be to-day no evidence that the Duke wrote this motto 
in his books, as Leland thought. But Mr. Gibson has found the motto 
on an old binding which contains a MS, that once belonged to Kymer 
(MS. Laud. misc. 558). 
2 Lists of the books given by Duke Humphrey are printed in Mun. 
Acad. (758-72) and Epist, Acad. (179-83, 204-5, and 232-7), The later 
lists are more interesting than the first. The Bodleian Quarterly Record 
(I, 131-5) gives an alphabetical list of all the books presented by the 
Duke in 1439, 1441 and 1444. One of the two books under the heading 
of Dante was a Latin commentary by Giovanni da Serravalle. Most of 
the books entered under Petrarch and Boccaccio were probably copies 
of Latin works by them. I have to thank Dr. H. H. E. Craster for this 
information, and for his note on the Duke’s gifts (Ib. III, 45), which I 
have followed. But Dr. Paget Toynbee has lately pointed out that the 
Liber Dantes in the list of 1444 was a copy of the Divina Commedia in the 
original, the earliest copy on record in this country (Times Lit. Supp., 
1920, 256). In an appendix to his life of the Duke (426 sg.) Mr. Vickers 
has collected interesting facts in regard to the later history of the MSS. 
which Humphrey possessed.

substantial'sum, which he thought entitled his College to the books. 
But after Adam’s death the Regent Masters’ descended ‘on Oriel 
and carried them off.’ Even then Oriel, with its rights over St. 
Mary’s; claimed possession or control of the building, and’ it 
was not till 14z0 that Archbishop Arundel was able to compose 
the claims of University and College. In 1367, when the Uni- 
versity was still fighting for the building, and even inventing 
deeds to support its claim,? the regulations which Bishop Cobham 
had drawn up for his Library were made public. “Some of ‘the 
manuscripts were sold, to provide a small income for a Chaplain 
or Librarian to take charge of the rest, and to see that no 
sacrilegious readers brought’ pen or ink’ or knife into the place. 
But the ‘earliest Library Statute dates from 1412. It assigned 
as’salary to the Chaplain or Librarian five pounds, six and eight- 
pence a’year; the six and eightpence was for celebrating masses, 
the hundred shillings yearly was drawn from the assize of bread 
and ale.’ The Librarian had also, like other University servants, 
his perquisite of robes. | Careful rules. for the use of. the books 
were laid down.’ Only graduates and’ senior ‘students * were 
allowed to read them, and sons of Lords of Parliament, who were 
privileged people. Precautions were taken against crowds and 
noise, misconduct’ and misuse. The names of all’ books and 
their donors were to be inscribed ““in an elegant and’ beautiful 
hand’ on a large and conspicuous board hung up ‘in the building. 
The Library was to be open from nine to eleven in ‘the morning 
and from one to four in the afternoon. But the Chancellor was 
allowed ‘to’ visit it during any hour of daylight; and to distin- 
guished strangers, and to Richard-Courtenay who had watched 
over its completion, the same favour was allowed.* In 1432:a 
singular ordinance for the encouragement of theological students 
secured, for the Library copies of all University sermons preached 
by Doctors. of Divinity and of all the examinatory sermons 
which Bachelors had to deliver.4 
Contributions of more permanent value soon began to come 
in, In.1435 Humphrey of Gloucester gave the University the 
first, ofthe many .memorable gifts. which were to. transform 
1 The Statute of 1412 speaks of its completion a good deal later, in 
Richard Courtenay’s time—‘‘ cujus temporibus et labore est completa 
domus ’’ (Mun, Acad..266). But it seems clear that the room was’ used 
before'that, and probably from 1367, when William Courtenay,’ Richard’s 
uncle, was Chancellor and took the matter up with vigour.

later of further contributions. He promised his “ Latin books” 
just before he died: and the Masters again and again appealed 
to his representatives to carry out what they at any rate looked 
on as a pledge.? But the manuscripts given during the Duke’s 
lifetime’ were in themselves’ a splendid. inheritance, and the

progress of the work was seriously delayed. But at last Bishop 
Kemp of London, the Cardinal's nephew, came ito the rescue

too appeared with contributions, Bishop Bekynton and Abbot 
Whethamstede among them. Master Somerset gave books and 
silken vestments, but the University hinted plainly that it would 
like to know what he, as one of the Duke’s administrators, had 
done with the rest of the library in his hands. The Duchess of 
Suffolk, a great lady allied to Chaucer and the Beauforts, gave 
“‘boks and golde.’” Thomas Knolles, a London grocer, gave a 
copy of Josephus. John Tiptoft Earl of Worcester bequeathed 
a fine collection of manuscripts gathered in the purest passion 
of an ill-spent life. Waynflete lent scaffolding 1 from his buildings 
at Magdalen, and workmen whose services the King had lent him, 
and whom the King was liable to recall. The work went on 
while dynasties tumbled—the new storey with its solid walls 
and their ten windows imposed upon the five great windows 
in the bays formed by the buttresses below. The Tudors were 
seated on the throne before all was completed. In 1487 we read 
of books remaining in the old Library; some, it seems, were still 
there in 1512.2. In 1488 we read of books being chained in the 
new Library, which was probably finished in that year or the 
next. Even then the history of the new Library was chequered. 
The rules for its protection were not too scrupulously kept. 
Readers, even Masters, borrowed the books and did not bring 
them back. Polydore Vergil, backed by Henry VII’s patronage, 
stands under some suspicion of purloining them.? Reginald 
Pole, allowed a few years later to enter the Library without 
wearing academical dress,‘ lived to see worse things befall it. 
Leland about 1540 noted some thirty volumes which he found 
there. Edward VI’s Commissioners, in 1550, ruthlessly broke 
up the great collection, scattered its splendid manuscripts, and 
sold or plundered its contents. The treasures gathered perhaps 
by Duke Humphrey and John Tiptoft were “sold away for 
Robin Hoods pennyworths, either to Booksellers, or to Glovers 
to press their gloves, or Taylors to make measures, or to Book- 
binders to cover books.”” Three at most of the Duke’s own volumes 
found their way to the Bodleian later. Two of these contain 
Duke Humphrey’s name and inscription. A third is dedicated 
1“ Edificiales machine” (Ep. Acad. 443). 
*The University Scribe borrowed Cicero’s Epistole ad Atticum from 
the old Congregation House in February 1512 (Reg. G, 141). See also 
Ep. Acad. (533 and 545) and Lyte (322-3). Mr. Macray’s date for the 
completion of the new room, about 1480 (Amn, of Bodl, 8), may be rather 
too early.

to him by its writer Aretino.! Of the rest a few have in after 
days been traced to Colleges or private owners, or have been 
secured by great Libraries at home or abroad. In 1556 the 
Library building was left empty and deserted. The University 
callously deputed the Vice-Chancellor and Proctors to sell the 
fittings which nobody required.? 
Duke Humphrey’s Library® replaced the older Library in 
Cobham’s building, though some books were left there for the 
time. But the old Congregation House was inevitably concerned 
in the fortunes of the Church. The fabric of St. Mary’s was now 
fast decaying. Already in 1462 Walter Lyhert, Bishop of 
Norwich and once Provost of Oriel, had rebuilt the chancel in 
the form which we know, and in 1487, before the new Library 
was finally completed, it was found necessary for the safety of 
the parishioners to rebuild the nave as well. The University 
set to work to collect funds with its usual courage. Benefactors 
came forward—one generous subscriber was Richard Lichfield, 
Archdeacon of Middlesex and Bath. ‘‘ Good deeds,” cries Wood 
with enthusiasm, ‘‘ trod on his heels, even to heaven gates.” 
Henry VII gave oaks for timbers. Two of his Ministers, Cardinal 
Morton and Sir Reginald Bray, are credited with helping: Bray 
indeed, as famous for building as for statecraft, has been credited 
with the design. Before the end of the fifteenth century a 
complete scheme of rebuilding had been adopted, and a new 
Perpendicular Church with great lights and lofty arches, with 
mouldings, woodwork and a “‘ paire of organs,” had arisen beside 
the noble thirteenth-century tower. The Congregation House 
was left, but its outer wall and windows were remodelled, so as 
1The three MSS. claimed as Duke Humphrey’s property are the 
Letters of Nicholas de Clemenges, the Letters of the younger Pliny, and 
Aretino’s translation of Aristotle’s Politics. Mr. Vickers doubts if the 
last was the actual volume presented by the Duke (Appendix, 427). He 
points out that Mr. Macray was mistaken in attributing to the Duke 
(Ann. 8) a MS. of Valerius Maximus given by Whethamstede. In the 
British Museum are several of the Duke’s MSS. not included in his gifts 
to Oxford. See also Gibson (Oxf. Libraries, 19-20). It is a question 
whether Tiptoft’s books were ever received. 
2 Macray (Ann. 11-12). But the building seems to have been handed 
over to the Faculty of Medicine, ‘‘ whose students had hitherto done their 
exercises in the Divinity School below ”’ (Bodl. Quart. Rec. III, 148). 
It may be noted that both early University Libraries ran East and West. 
So did early Libraries at Balliol, Lincoln, Brasenose, Corpus, Wadham— 
to say nothing of later buildings. Merton Library ran East and West 
and North and South. Many Oxford Libraries, no doubt, ran North and 
South, as the old rule suggested. But it seems that at Oxford convenience 
was at least a strong element in deciding the direction which they took.

to correspond with the new large windows of the Church, and to 
give the impression from the outside that the building consisted 
of one storey instead of two.1 Early in the sixteenth century 
the upper chamber, the old Library, was decorated and roofed 
anew, and apparently became the meeting-place of Congregation. 
There is a reference in one of the Registers in 1507 to the “ dobul 
roffe of the congregatyon howse with paytyngys and knottes 
gyltyd”’; and in another, in the year following, there is an 
acknowledgment of a payment made by Edmund Bishop of 
Salisbury for the new building above the House of Congregation, 
which the Bishop’s liberality is said to have rebuilt.2_ The desks 
and seats of the old Library it was proposed to transfer to the 
Canon Law School, where a new fabric also replaced the old. 
The University was slowly increasing its possessions, but its 
ancient Chests with their regulations remained. The example 
set in the days of Grosseteste had been followed by other bene- 
factions since. The Warwick Chest, the Winton Chest, the 
Guildford Chest, the Burnel Chest, the Chichester Chest and many 
another,® recalled dignitaries in Church and State, who had given 
funds for the use of students with increasing liberality since the 
fourteenth century began. Elaborate ordinances governed their 
foundation. Borrowers from the Warwick Chest were bound to 
repeat the Lord’s Prayer thrice in honour of the Trinity and the 
Ave Maria five times in honour of the Virgin. The donors’ 
names were publicly recited, and special masses were offered for 
their souls. Guardians of the Chests were regularly elected, and 
were sometimes sharply summoned to give an account of their 
trust. The Chest of the Four Keys, founded in the fourteenth 
century, contained rolls or registers of the University’s belongings, 
muniments and charters, books and transcripts® and Proctor’s

Chapel on the West side of the tower, which was partitioned off from the 
church later.

“cista exemplariorum ” (Mun, Ac. 155) was not a ‘‘ Chest of Patterns,” 
as Sir H. M. Lyte (180, n.) translates it, following Mr. Anstey, but a Chest 
of documents, containing pledges given by appellants as a guarantee 
against frivolous appeals. It may, or may not, have been a separate 
Chest. No patterns of academical dress were kept in the Archives ; but

accounts. Its guardians were the two Proctors and two Regents 
in Arts from the North and the South! In 1412 a new Chest 
of Five Keys was established, to contain, in the sweeping terms 
of the ordinance, all goods accruing to the University in future,? 
and two Heads of Colleges were called in to act as guardians 
together with the Chancellor and Proctors. But in 1427 another 
Chest of Five Keys was found necessary, and was apparently 
devoted to jewels and money alone. In this case neither the 
Proctors nor the Heads of Colleges reappeared as guardians, 
though the same care was taken to represent both North and 
South. The Chancellor, two Regents in Arts and two Non- 
Regents from the Colleges were made custodians, and a regular 
audit by four Doctors and four Masters was required. It may 
be that the opportunity was taken to reorganise the arrangements. 
Once again the assets for which the Proctors were specially 
responsible were defined. The older Chests perhaps were over- 
crowded and falling out of use. In any case only one Chest 
of Five Keys survived the troubles of the Reformation. It 
passed into the keeping of Corpus Christi College later, when 
most of its companions had been sold. Besides these, a Chest 
of Three Keys was instituted for a more temporary purpose in 
1437, to help in the building of the Divinity School.® 
Other Chests were founded for the benefit of students or 
for the use of special Colleges, and were administered on similar 
lines. Stapledon Hall from early days had two Chests of its 
own. Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter, the brother of the 
Cardinal, left a hundred pounds for a Chest at Queen’s, and a 
similar sum for one at Trinity College, Cambridge. Two other 
fifteenth-century foundations, the Chichele Chest and the Danvers 
Chest, allowed the University and the Colleges to borrow, and 
thus diminished the funds available for poor scholars, who sought, 
as the Archbishop eloquently put it, “the pearl in the field of 
engravings of them were kept in the Convocation House under a Statute 
of 1770 (Poole, 5-6). 
1 Mun. Ac. (152-3): the date is before 1380. Dr. Poole suggests 
1347, and would identify the Chest of the Four Keys with the New Chest, 
which was apparently combined with the Selton Chest later (Ib. 155 and 
219). It is difficult to say how many University Chests there were, or 
how many were known as Proctors’ Chests at one time or another (Jb. 
155, 228, 235, 501). 
2“ Bona quecunque, cujuscunque nature, quocunque titulo, Uni- 
versitati in posterum proventura ” (Ib. 259). These ‘‘ goods ” included 
copies of new Statutes (Ib. 253-4). 
Mr. Anstey gives the ordinances for the two Chests of Five Keys 
(Ib. 257-9 and 280-2): but the dates should be 1412 and 1427. 
‘ The Chests in the lower House of Congregation were ordered to be 
sold—presumably the old loan chests—in January 1546 (Poole, 11).

divine knowledge.’ The great Duke of Bedford is credited with 
establishing the Chest of the Three Philosophies and the Seven 
Liberal Arts; and in 1439 it was resolved that all books given 
by Duke Humphrey or others for lectures on these subjects 
should be kept in this Chest in the Library under the Librarian’s 
control, and the books borrowed by Regents or by other Masters 
for the use of their students.1 Some fifty years later Archbishop 
Bourchier, an old University Chancellor, left money for Chests 
at Oxford and Cambridge.? Occasionally the University received 
' gifts of a different kind. Bishop Northburgh of London left 
funds for law students in 1361.8 Henry VI assigned revenues 
for his scholars from Eton. And the foundation of the Chest 
of the Three Philosophies and Seven Arts was made the pretext 
for fresh appeals by the University both to Bedford and to 
Gloucester, which resulted in the maintenance for a time at any 
rate of special Lecturers on those subjects. But funds for Chests 
for lending purposes were long the favourite form of benefaction, 
and it was in the lower room of the Old House of Congregation 
that these Chests were generally stored. 
The Proctors’ Accounts which survive from the latter part 
of the fifteenth century > show that the University’s average 
income was then about fifty-eight pounds and its average ex- 
penditure less than forty-five. Any surplus went to the Chests 
and was probably spent in building. Besides payments for 
degrees and Graces,* some four or five pounds a year came in 
from rents, four pounds, fourteen and eightpence from the old 
Oseney and Eynsham contributions, two or three pounds from 
the Grammar Masters, which, however, ceased in 1477, and some 
two pounds a year more from fines for breaches of the peace 
and other small payments.” One of the chief items of expenditure 
was the cost of the yearly entertainments to Inceptors on the 
vigils of St. John the Baptist and St. Peter. This ranged from 
five pounds upwards—in 1496 it rose to nearly nine—the charges 
including lights and rushes and the carrying of benches to wherever

the entertainment might be held1_ The payment divided among 
the Regent Masters was nearly four pounds a year.2. The audi- 
tors got something. The Proctors too got something, a share of 
fines and of degree fees, small payments for their expenses, for their 
night watch, for the hire and repair of armour: the amount 
perhaps depended on the balance in hand. The Proctors had 
no regular salaries, but some official profits were expected and 
received. A salary of four marks was paid to the Registrar, 
a salary of five pounds, six and eightpence to the Chaplain who 
was also Librarian of the University, and there were smaller 
payments to others, including the parish clerks of St. Mary’s 
and St. Peter’s. Rent was paid for one or two University 
buildings, seven shillings to Balliol for the Divinity School site. 
Payments for the new buildings were in the fifteenth century a 
constantly recurring item. Political troubles, no doubt, caused 
some expenditure. Attentions to great men—doubly necessary 
in times of revolution—accounted for more. And the defence of 
the University’s legal rights and privileges sometimes made a 
serious inroad on the limited means which the Masters could 
command. 
It is to be feared, however, that neither accounts nor docu- 
ments were kept in early days with the care that they deserved. 
We hear of University property disappearing ‘‘in a marvellous 
way’ through the negligence of Proctors.6 We have stories 
of Chests being robbed and their guardians admitted to compur- 
gation. In 1449 the Chest of Four Keys, when searched in 
vain for a missing document, proved to be so full of rolls and 
bonds of no value that a Committee of eight Doctors and Masters 
was nominated to reform it.? In 148r we find Master John 
Brertone summoned “once, twice, thrice, and peremptorily ”’ 
to account for his management of the Danvers Chest.§ Later 
on, in 1510, there were complaints that the accounts of the Chests 
had not been audited for thirty years ; and Archbishop Warham, 
the Chancellor, sent down a Master named John Yong, who was 
appointed by Congregation with eleven others to conduct a 
complete examination, and to report on the total sums deposited, 
1 In 1469 it seems to have been at Queen’s, in 1471 at Durham College. 
2 £3 18s. 8d., provided by Eynsham and Oseney, was the sum distributed 
from 1478 onwards. Before that the amount was larger. 
3 In 1474, Mr. Salter points out (Med. Arch. II, 283) the profits of one 
Proctor must have been £5 17s. 1d. (See his introduction, mentioned 
above, for these and many other interesting details.) 
« £5 of this came from the assize of bread and ale. In 1481 ninepence 
more was added, perhaps for the saying of an additional mass (Ib. 286).

on the loss sustained by the insufficiency of pledges, and on the 
actual value of what remained. Details of sixteen Chests are 
given in the report : there seem to be some inaccuracies, and the 
figures quoted are not complete. But the total sums due to 
these sixteen Chests are estimated at six hundred and fifteen 
pounds, and the total deficiency at two hundred and thirty-four 
pounds, a considerable proportion of the whole. The Committee, 
or a smaller Committee of which Yong was a member, pushed 
their inquiries further with unsatisfactory results. Books, 
presumably University pledges, improperly abstracted and never 
properly redeemed, were found in the house of Mrs. Hunt, the 
widow of the late University Stationer, and in the hands of two 
Bedels who had already done some profitable trading in volumes 
of this kind. Advantage was no doubt frequently taken of the 
negligence shown by University officials.? 
The University, moreover, was always afraid that manuscripts 
of value would be sold and carried away from Oxford. ‘‘ The 
excessive multitude of sellers of books” was made a pretext 
for confining to official Stationers the right of selling any volume 
worth more than half a mark. The Stationers were sworn to 
protect the Chests from loss, without interfering with their 
management, and to render a faithful account of all goods there 
deposited which came into their hands.* Relics were regarded 
as a bad security. Perishable goods were not readily received. 
It was the Stationer’s business to value University pledges. If 
he had a monopoly of selling them, he was responsible for the 
moneys received. In 1412 Congregation apparently became 
alarmed about the condition of certain books and other “ ante- 
pestilential’” pledges,> and appointed a Committee of eight 
Masters to co-operate with the University Stationer in selling 
them off. In the same year the Stationer’s duty was found to 
be so anxious and laborious, that he was included among the 
University officials to whom students on graduation were expected 
to give clothes. And in the same year also the University,

seventeen Chests, and another list (745-7) of twenty-two Chests under

University Stationer was contemplated in the Statutes. But references 
elsewhere to the Stationer (Ib. 253, 255) seem to indicate that the University 
was generally satisfied with having one official Stationer at a time.

observing that it was of little value to make laws and to neglect 
to keep them, ordered the Proctors to see that Statutes passed 
during their term of office were inscribed in the Chancellor’s 
and Proctors’ Books, and a copy of them deposited in the Chest 
of Five Keys. But this salutary provision failed of effect. 
Before long the University was obliged to appoint a Registrar 
or Scribe,* whose duty it should be to give form and permanence 
to its public acts, to draft its letters, to make copies of its docu- 
ments, to register Graces and the names of graduates and their 
‘‘examinatory sermons.” The Scribe, besides his salary of four 
marks yearly, took fees from individuals for registering their . 
Graces and degrees. 
The Statutes generally looked to the past, and one new 
departure of the fifteenth century attracted, it would seem, 
but little notice in the University, though it marked an epoch 
in the world of letters. The first book printed at Oxford bears 
the surprising date of 1468. It is a Latin commentary on the 
Apostles’ Creed, called by the name of St. Jerome but written by 
Rufinus of Aquileia. It claims to be older than Caxton’s printing 
press at Westminster, older than the first presses of Paris and 
Utrecht, almost as old as those of Basle and of Cologne. A 
legend, started in the seventeenth century, declared that a 
printer, abducted from Haarlem by a conspiracy at which Arch- 
bishop Bourchier, Henry VI and Caxton connived, had been 
brought over under guard to Oxford, and had there set up the 
earliest English press. But the tale which Richard Atkyns of 
Balliol repeated or invented with the shameless freedom of the 
Restoration, and which Wood and others adopted, has ceased to 
find belief. Though the volume of 1468 with its date remains 
in evidence, it is not to Frederick Corsellis of Haarlem that its 
production can be traced. Bibliographers of great authority 
have suspected that the book was dated carelessly or deliberately 
ten years too soon.? But even if the doubt exists, if Oxford

eruditus.” The date is uncertain. (See MS. C.C.C. Camb. 423, pp. 63-4.) 
I owe the reference to Mr. Gibson, who is printing the Statute—as I owe 
so many others. Possibly John Manyngham (Boase, Reg. I, 14) was the 
first Registrar. He was in office in 1446 (Med. Arch. II, 284). 
3 The question is fully discussed by Mr. Madan in his volumes on The 
Early Oxford Press (1895, especially App. A) and The University Press at 
Oxford (1908), to which I owe most of these details. A great authority 
reminds us that “it is dangerous to assert that a book is wrongly dated 
because you cannot make it fit into a bibliographical theory,” and a paper 
by Mr. Madan in The Library for April 1918 on Two Lost Causes points 
out that all the watermarks in the St. Jerome are found in paper made 
as early as 1468. See also Bodl. Quart. Record (I, 142). But Mr. Gordon 
Duff (Early Printed Books, Chap. IX) decides for the later date, 1478.

cannot be proved beyond question to be the birthplace of the 
British Press, the credit and interest of this early experiment 
in printing at Oxford remain. The ‘“‘ St. Jerome” was followed 
by some fifteen other volumes before 1487, most of which 
apparently owed their existence to Theodoric Rood. Rood was 
a printer who came from Cologne, and set up a small press in 
the High Street, or possibly found one already established there. 
Later on he took into partnership the University Stationer 
Thomas Hunt,’ whose love of a good book tempted him to 
doubtful dealings in the manuscripts deposited in the Chests. 
The second known volume issued by this little business was 
Aretino’s translation of Aristotle’s Ethics. It is dated 1479. 
Another was Cicero’s oration Pro Milone, which if really produced 
at Oxford about 1480, was the first classic printed in this country.? 
Others included works on grammar, logic and theology, a com- 
mentary on Aristotle’s De Anima by Alexander of Hales, with a 
fine woodcut border dating from 1481, and the first edition of 
Lyndwood’s great work on Canon Law. Of all these rare and 
early volumes copies or fragments still remain. But soon after 
the accession of the House of Tudor the first Oxford Press closed 
down. In the reign of Henry VIII the experiment was repeated, 
and two printers, working in St. John Street under the shadow 
of Merton, produced about half-a-dozen books. But it was not 
till the days of Elizabeth that the printers of Oxford were able 
to establish a business that endured. And it was not till the 
seventeenth century that Archbishop Laud and Dean Fell 
secured for them the rights and the resources which were to make 
the Oxford Press a power. 
The University Chancellors of the fifteenth century were 
often men of influence in the State. Robert Hallam, afterwards 
Bishop of Salisbury, elected Chancellor in 1403, played a great 
part in ecclesiastical politics abroad. No man was more respected 
for his fearless efforts to reform abuses and to restore peace 
within the Church. Richard Courtenay, who defied Arundel’s 
authority and even threatened the Archbishop with excom- 
munication, was a still more conspicuous figure. He fought hard

the Epistles of Phalaris printed in 1485. ‘‘ Hoc Teodericus rood quem

I, 272) has traced Rood’s house in the High Street, now 35 and 36, where 
. Dyryke Dowcheman or Dyryk Rode was tenant in 1480 and 1482. John 
Dowcheman had the house before that. (See also Mr. Madan’s article in

for the privileges of the University. He established its Library 
on a proper footing. He was never backward to defend its 
cause. But for all his independence he retained the favour of 
Henry IV. And under Henry V, his dear and constant friend, 
he was largely employed in public duties, made Bishop of a 
See which he had no time to visit, and drawn to the camp of the 
great King in France. He died abroad in the King’s presence, 
and was buried by Henry’s order behind the high altar of 
Westminster, in the Confessor’s Chapel where Henry was himself 
to lie. Thomas Chace, the Master of Balliol who set the new 
Divinity School on foot, was Chancellor in 14261 and later. 
A prominent figure in University business, he came into sharp 
conflict with the town. He apparently prevented the fishmongers 
who had stalls in the High Street from paying anything for 
stallage to the Bailiffs, and was accused by the Mayor and 
Burgesses of stretching his rights of jurisdiction to do them 
“oppressions, wrongs and injuries.” 2 Some of the resident 
Chancellors like Chace, or like Henry Sever who became Warden 
of Merton, or like Robert Thwaytes who became Master of 
Balliol,? spent the best years of their life in Oxford and devoted 
themselves to University affairs. Gilbert Kymer, though he 
moved in the world, became a Court physician, and secured 
Duke Humphrey’s patronage and probably his books, was an 
active member of Congregation. He was Proctor in 1412. He 
was for a short time Principal of Hart Hall. He was Chancellor 
in 1431, 1432 and 1433, and again for several years before 1453. 
His ‘‘ prudence, sobriety, watchfulness, courage,” made him, 
we are told, a mirror for his successors.‘ He never forgot the 
University, though called to Church preferments for which the 
greatest of physicians would now sigh in vain. And Chancellors 
like Thomas Gascoigne and Thomas Chaundler were identified 
with Oxford interests to the end. 
Gascoigne, one of the most picturesque of medizval Chancellors, 
received and perhaps desired no advancement. He spent most 
of his vigorous and bustling life in the University. He had 
rooms for many years at Oriel, where his private fortune prevented 
his election asa Fellow. He preached. He wrote. He denounced 
heresy and heretics. But he also denounced unceasingly abuses 
dealings with a well-known MS. now in the Bodleian, see Bodl. Quart. 
Record (II, 118-20).

in the Church—the ignorance, the neglect of duty, the venality 
and corruption, which had crept in even to the University itself. 
He spared the Regents and students of Oxford as little as he 
spared the lawyers or the monks. He attacked with equal 
fervour indecencies of dress and conduct, the grave heterodoxy 
of Bishop Pecock, the cynical complaisance of another Bishop— 
from St. David’s—who refused to put down concubinage among 
his clergy because it brought him in four hundred marks a year. 
Gascoigne had, no doubt, a sharp tongue and a censorious eye 
for others. But he lived in a society whose standards were 
probably deteriorating every day, and those standards, it seems, 
he did his best to raise. His strict honesty refused preferments 
the duties of which he could not perform. But he was ready 
enough to serve as Chancellor or Commissary or ‘‘ Cancellarius 
natus ’’—that is as senior Doctor of Divinity acting as Chancellor 
when a vacancy occurred. His notes in the Registers and the 
high praises of his colleagues! bear witness to his unceasing 
interest in his work. His Theological Dictionary, preserved by 
Lincoln College, reveals a great deal of his character and story. 
His body lies buried at New College. His will is among the 
records of the Chancellor's Court. The Chancellor in whose 
Court it was proved deserves to rank beside him as a life-long 
servant of the University in very difficult times. Thomas 
Chaundler, for so long Warden of New College, was repeatedly 
Chancellor or Commissary between 1457 and 1479. He did most 
of the work for George Neville, when that high-placed dignitary 
was occupied elsewhere. He was one of the most prominent 
and trusted of University officials. He was a scholar who hailed 
with enthusiasm the first faint dawn of the classical Renaissance. 
And he must have been a ruler possessed of both tact and 
adaptability to be a successful Chancellor or Vice-Chancellor in 
the quick changes of those revolutionary years. 
But some of the fifteenth-century Chancellors found it difficult 
or impossible to reside in Oxford. Kymer, a Court doctor, 
held benefices at Wimborne, Salisbury and elsewhere. Even 
Chaundler was Chaplain to Edward IV, and was often called 
1In 1436 the Chancellor and Regents spoke of him as “‘ iste doctor 
catholicus, qui cedulo sudore studii inter nos sane doctrine metit manipulos, 
quibus oves Christiani ovilis sane et catholice pascere novit’’ (Ib. 137). 
Nine years later the University appealed to the King on his behalf (Jb. 
247-9). 2 Gascoigne matriculated before 1420, was Chancellor in 1434 and 
1444-5, and died early in 1458. (See Dr. Poole’s valuable notice, D.N.B.) 
His will is given in Mun, Ac. (671-2). The MS. of his Dictionary, though 
the property of Lincoln, is now kept at the Bodleian. Prof. J. E. T. 
Rogers edited a selection of extracts from it under the title of Loci e Libro 
Veritatum.

  FIFTEENTH CENTURY OXFORD 331 
away from the University. And men like Thomas Bourchier, 
of Royal blood and great connections, passed on quickly to 
Bishoprics and higher things. Bourchier was Bishop of Worcester 
in 1434 and Bishop of Ely in 1435, while he still held the Chancellor- 
ship of Oxford. And as Primate and Cardinal, crowning in turn 
Edward IV, Richard III and Henry VII, he could have had little 
time to spare later for University affairs. But his Register at 
Lambeth shows him taking part in the appointment of Wardens 
at Canterbury College, All Souls and Merton, and he left the 
University a bequest in his will. William Gray of Balliol, who 
succeeded Bourchier in the Bishopric of Ely, was trained at 
Oxford and lived there for some time. He served as Chancellor 
in 1441-2. His love of learning drew him abroad, and his 
duties as Bishop engrossed him later. But he left his splendid 
manuscripts to his old College, which he never forgot. George 
Neville was Chancellor at twenty-one, and was re-elected for 
obvious reasons when his family were masters of the State. 
But he was far too deeply plunged in politics to do more than 
patronise or feast his academic friends. That duty, however, 
he is said to have performed on a prodigious scale.? Lionel 
Woodville, later on, had also greater interests to attend to, and 
his Royal connections became an embarrassment when a usurper 
drove his family from power. John Russell, once a Fellow of 
New College, was already Lord Chancellor and Bishop of Lincoln, 
when chosen Chancellor by the University which had long ceased 
to fear the Bishop’s interference. He has been called the first 
perpetual Chancellor, as he held the office till his death. Russell, 
said Sir Thomas More, was a wise man and a good man, and one 
of the best-learned of his time. He made a speech which was 
printed by Caxton. He visited Oxford with Henry VII. His 
arms are on the roof of the Divinity School to-day. His successor, 
Cardinal Morton, who followed Gray in the Bishopric of Ely 
and Bourchier in the Archbishopric of Canterbury, and for whom 
in an hour of imprisonment and danger the University had 
interceded in the warmest terms, would scarcely accept the 
office of Chancellor when the Masters laid it at his feet. He told 
them that he could not attend to its duties. He refused to 
take the oath which was usually required. Morton had been 
Commissary in 1446, when Thwaytes was Chancellor, and had 
had his earliest administrative training in University affairs.®

honours or popular applause. He helped, however, to rebuild 
St. Mary’s and the old Canon Law School. He helped also to 
train Sir Thomas More. But for great prelates like Morton or 
like Warham, who elected later, in the sixteenth century, held 
the office for six and twenty years, residence in Oxford was out 
of the question. More and more the Chancellorship became a 
post of dignity divorced from the daily administration of affairs. 
The University perhaps needed a friend at Court to protect it. 
The Court may have been glad to have an agent on whom it 
could rely. The Commissaries or Vice-Chancellors gradually 
entered into their inheritance, and took up the local duties 
which the Chancellors resigned. 
The Statutes of the fifteenth century throw some light on 
the University’s disorders, but they throw little light on the 
general history of the time. The rivalry between Town and 
Gown was not over, but the Town had been forced to realise 
the University’s strength. In 1406 we find it appointing four 
representatives to treat with four representatives of the University 
in regard to disputes between them, and two years later referring 
differences to the Archbishop of Canterbury and the King’s 
Council. In 1429 the townsmen again appealed to the Council : 
they could not tolerate the action of Chancellor Chace. In May 
1432 the University could devise no better method of allaying 
these “calamitous and detestable’’ dissensions and of averting 
the wrath of God from the sinners, than to organise a solemn 
procession of Doctors, Masters, scholars and priests, with elaborate 
regulations as to the order they should walk in.2_ But practical 
co-operation was more useful than processions. In 1450 the 
University provided scholars to watch for a time with townsmen 
at the gates. In 1459 an important agreement was drawn up, 
for which perhaps the Chancellor, Chaundler, and the Mayor may 
share the credit, to settle vexed questions in regard to the privilege 
of University dependents and the rights of Chancellor and Mayor 
respectively to deal with offenders and disturbers.of the peace. 
The privileged class, which had been steadily increasing, was 
carefully defined. Masters, scholars, clerks and their servants, 
University officers and their attendants, stationers, book-binders, 
writers, barbers, cooks and caterers, carriers, poor children, and 
many others serving or trading within the University precincts, 
were admitted to be under the Chancellor’s protection, and on 
the other side it was admitted that the privilege of the University

should extend to them alone.t The Chancellor continued to 
exercise authority over the town. He dealt faithfully with 
defaulting taverners and tradesmen. In 1480 he made the 
cooks into a corporation, and settled the toll to be paid at the 
East gate, when they rode into the town in their bravery in 
Whitsun week. In 1491 he granted privileges to the guild of 
tailors. In 1499 he admitted the hurers or cappers into the 
ancient society of barbers—the wearing of rough caps may have 
been the fashion even then—and forbade any hurer, “ within 
the procincts of Oxford dwellinge, to sell a old capp new dressed 
for a new capp under payne of forfeitture of the same to the 
Chaunceller and one pounde of waxe to our Ladie light.” 4 
The keeping of the peace and the maintenance of order were 
still the first necessities alike of Royal and of academic legislation. 
At the beginning of the fifteenth century Irishmen figured largely 
in the records of lawlessness, rivalling the Welsh who had been 
conspicuous just before. In 1413 Henry V with the assent of 
Parliament banished all Irish and Irish begging Clerks called 
“ Chaumberdeakyns ” for the sake of tranquillity in the Realm. 
One of the first Statutes of Henry VI repeated this order, and 
dwelt on the “‘ homicides, murders, rapes, robberies and other 
felonies ’’ committed by Irishmen dwelling under the University’s 
jurisdiction,“ to the great fear of all manner of people dwelling 
thereabout.”® But graduates in the Schools were exempted 
from both Statutes, and a Royal writ soon exempted students 
also.? ‘‘ Wylde Irisshmen who had nothing to live on” defied 
the authorities, and were accused of burning houses down.® 
Clerkly highwaymen appeared upon the roads. Poachers roamed 
the woods of Shotover and Woodstock.® Scholars and clerks 
of the University, ‘‘ unknown, armed and arrayed for purposes 
of war,” dared, in the words of the Royal Statute, to hunt with

dogs by day and night, to capture deer and hares and coneys, 
and to threaten the keepers of them with their lives. About the 
year 1410 the University, bewailing the ‘‘mad continuance of 
execrable dissensions,” set up a delightfully elaborate scale of 
fines for disturbers of the peace—twelve pence for threats of 
personal injury, four shillings for pushing with the shoulder or 
striking with the fist, ten shillings for a blow with knife or 
sword or dagger, twenty shillings for carrying bows and arrows 
with evil intent, forty shillings for night wandering or resisting 
the execution of justice.1 The force of money penalties as 
compared with oaths or compurgation was coming home at last 
to academic minds. Gascoigne noted how many rascals were 
ready to swear to their innocence in public while in private they 
admitted their guilt. 
The University’s ordinances were as outspoken as the King’s. 
They too denounced the ‘‘ Chamberdekenys,” who ‘in the form 
of scholars” lurked about Oxford, dwelling in no Halls, but 
spending their days in sleep, their nights in taverns, brothels, 
homicide and theft.? All scholars were required to reside in 
some Hall or College. Townsmen were forbidden to take them 
in as lodgers without express permission. All unattached and 
wandering students must have a recognised place of residence in 
future: they were liable to imprisonment or banishment as 
“rotten members ”’ if they disobeyed. In 1420 Henry V issued 
an edict for the preservation of the peace, which, while exacting 
an oath from all new-comers to the University, and prohibiting 
lodgings in the houses of laymen, placed all scholars and their 
servants under the control of Principals whom the University 
admitted and approved.* Henry VI characteristically recom- 
mended Latin sermons as the best means to increase ‘“‘ vertu and 
cunning,’ while he desired to see ‘‘ misgovernance’”’ put down.‘ 
But even sermons failed to prevent tumultuous scenes at the 
feasts of graduation, or beating on doors and roofs and tables 
and throwing of stones to annoy the guests.5 The Chancellor and 
Proctors bound themselves by fresh oaths to suffer no partiality 
or weakness in enforcing law. But the students may have found 
1 There were further fines for Masters and scholars, varying with the 
means of the offender (Mun. Ac. 314 sq.). The date here is probably 
about 1410. But the provisions reappear in the group of Statutes dated 
May 24, 1432 (Ib. 304-6). The fines went, one-third to the Chancellor, 
one-third to the Proctors and one-third to the University. The Chancellor 
and Proctors paid the Bedels 2d. out of every 1s. they received (Mun. Ac. 
317-18). Mr. Salter’s division (Med. Arch. II, 277) seems to be rather 
different.

little difficulty in evading regulations which they disliked. We 
hear little or nothing of the Civil War, though we have notices 
of injuries and woundings, and of a riot at the Crown Inn followed 
by the excommunication of the offenders.1_ In 1470 indeed the 
University asserted that not a single scholar had to its knowledge 
taken arms on either side.2 But the confusion in the country 
must have increased the opportunities of any young men who 
loved a fight, and it may be that incidents occurred in Oxford 
which it was the business of University officials to ignore. 
Increased supervision of the scholars involved the better 
organisation of the Halls. The Chancellor’s right to veto and 
to alter Hall Statutes was re-affirmed: it dated by tradition 
from the days of Edward I.3 Principals were forbidden to take 
in students whom other Heads of Houses had expelled—at any 
rate till the offenders had been punished and satisfactory pledges 
of amendment had been given4—and they were required to 
swear that they would admit no one without good evidence of 
character.’ But the Principals themselves, for fear of losing 
their profits, were often too lax in expelling or punishing delin- 
quents;; and as such remissness could only be due to a want of 
education, the University in 1432 insisted that all Principals 
and their substitutes should be graduates in future.6 It was 
recognised that Principals ought to have some power to teach. 
Before the end of the century a new code of Hall Statutes was 
published, drawn up apparently in the Chancellorship of Gilbert 
Kymer and revised in that of Bishop Russell, which Principals 
and scholars were bound to study and observe. They forbade 
any Hall student to change his quarters to another Hall without 
the permission of his old Principal and the Chancellor’s assent.” 
They limited the right of Principals to be absent during term 
time. They laid down rules of discipline and conduct, rules 
for study, for religious services, for orderly behaviour, for cleanli- 
ness and peace. They provided punishments, even whippings, 
for offenders. Boys who were still boys had to be forbidden 
to break windows, to spill liquor on the cloth, to cut their names 
on tables, to draw pictures on the walls. But the standards of

  336 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
the Halls were scarcely distinguishable from those which the 
Colleges required, and they marked, no doubt, a further step 
in the process by which the old democratic and independent 
Halls of medieval Oxford were being brought under University 
control. 
It might be expected that these measures would have 
strengthened the position of the Halls. But as a matter of 
fact they went hand in hand with their decay. It may be that 
reform came too late to save a system which had already served 
its purpose. It may be that in days of political disturbance, 
with the number of students generally declining, and the Oxford 
grammar-schools going out of fashion, many of the old Halls 
were already almost empty, or had fallen into a condition which 
no reforms could revive. So late as 1462 we have a long list of 
Masters offering security as Principals to Chancellor and Proctors, 
and more than sixty Halls appear still to be in use.1_ The old 
names, White Hall and Black Hall, Vine Hall, Eagle Hall, Hawk 
Hall, Corner Hall and many another figure in the list. But 
before the middle of the next century most of these had gone. 
The Colleges were stepping into their places and were opening 
their doors to the undergraduate world. The inadequacy of the 
old Hall buildings and the overcrowding of students in small 
quarters probably contributed their share to this result. They 
contributed also to the insanitary conditions, to the outbreaks 
of pestilence of which the chronicles are full, to the bad air, the 
bad smells, the dirt and the bad drainage, which so often in 
medieval Oxford brought diseases in their train. 
But Hall students had clearly no monopoly of the troubles 
of the time. We still hear of many lively incidents, of a hot- 
headed scholar breaking a manciple’s head, of a Commissary 
committing sins which called for his removal, of practices which 
recall Adam of Usk’s adventure in stealing another man’s horse.? 
Mendicant Friars had not ceased from troubling. One of them, 
William Russell, so shocked the University by his unconven- 
tional opinions on morals and on tithes, that Inceptors were 
required to abjure his doctrines. An Augustinian Canon was 
sent to prison for bearing arms. An Augustinian Friar took 
upon himself to excommunicate a Doctor of Divinity, and had 
to fly from Oxford for such gross contempt of the Chancellor’s 
rights. The University could hardly bring itself to pardon him,

(Jb. 519-22, 618-21, and 675-9) and dated respectively 1438, 1451 and 
1458. The numbers are between sixty and seventy in each case. 
2 Adam of Usk, the chronicler, taught Canon Law in Oxford about 
1387 and, it seems, Civil Law later. His strange theft in 1400 caused a 
scandal and interrupted his career. (See his Chronicon, ed. Thompson, 
1904, xi-xiii and xxi-ii, and the references there given.)

  FIFTEENTH CENTURY OXFORD 337 
even when Humphrey of Gloucester interceded in his behalf.t 
Unlicensed medical practitioners were still regarded as disturbers 
of the peace. Even authorised doctors might lose a part of 
their profits if they failed to complete a patient’s cure.2 Medi- 
zeval justice found obvious advantages in paying them by results. 
Begging was still sanctioned by the Chancellor’s license. Poor 
scholars of Oxford still found it profitable to sing ‘‘ at rich mens 
,dores.” Wood has a pleasant story of one rich man so pestered, 
who led the beggars to a well and bade them make verses on 
it or get nothing. The scholars, “‘ scratching their heads and 
looking smilingly upon each other,’ produced after a little 
pause three Latin epigrams adroit enough to melt the hardest 
of hearts. Even Bishops—Aorribile dictu—went astray. And 
Bishop Pecock’s heresies made such a stir in clerical circles that 
the University authorities felt compelled to march in solemn 
procession to Carfax and there to preside over the burning of 
his books.* 
Pecock, it must be admitted, had an unruly, independent 
mind. But it seems doubtful whether he would have been 
interfered with had not his patrons in politics been upon the 
losing side. As it was, the theological enemies whom he had 
made impartially in all camps, took advantage of Yorkist preju- 
dice against him. He had won his reputation as a champion of 
the Church. He had justified and defended Popes and Bishops 
—not always in the most judicious way. He had laboured in 
his Book of Faith ‘‘to win the lay children of the Church into 
obedience,” and to defend her doctrine upon rational grounds. 
His Repressor of Over Much Blaming of the Clergy is not only a 
fine argument in medieval English, defending Church practices 
against the charges of the Lollards, but also a fine plea for moral 
law. But his Lancastrian friends were dead. The Friars 
remembered that he had called them “ pulpit-brawlers.” The 
Lollards loved him little. The Yorkist prelates loved him less. 
He got into difficulties over the early Fathers. He showed a 
readiness for criticism and a taste for contradiction which led 
him sometimes to contradict himself. And when he ventured 
to revise the Creed, all parties joined to overwhelm him. He 
was forced to resign and to recant.5 Pecock had been a Fellow

?In March 1500 a certain Dionysius was adjudged to deserve only

fully cured his patient (Reg. d, f. 32%).

of Oriel and at one time a teacher in Oxford. Gascoigne detested 
his opinions: and they may possibly have made some way 
among the younger students. But Oxford as a whole had out- 
grown its Wycliffism and heresy found it a barren soil. So 
orthodox indeed had the University become that, before the 
fifteenth century was over, the Pope seems to have given the 
Chancellor the right of conferring minor Orders and of licensing 
preachers to preach where they pleased. 
More serious than the fear of heresy was the general laxity 
and lowering of standards alike in the University and in the 
Church. Degrees at Oxford in the fifteenth century were often 
too easily obtained. ‘‘ Wicked and debauched persons ” managed 
to secure them. Early in the century the University resolved 
to disqualify candidates who obtained letters from influential 
persons to ‘“‘ extort’’ graces for degrees.2- And in 1441 another 
Statute bewailed the multiplication of ‘‘ inept and frivolous” 
Graces, and the disregard of the old rules of procedure on the 
subject.2 Too much regard was paid, no doubt, to influence 
and rank. Wood tells a story of an Archdeacon of Oxford 
about the middle of the century who owed his preferment to 
“a very great personage of Royal blood.” He was “not only 
a Natural, but also a Sot.” He was drunk every day. He 
could understand no more Latin than a parrot. His profession 
of faith was a profession of confidence in his income. And cases 
of this kind did not stand alone. ‘‘ Virtue and learning went 
barefoot.” Asses and fools with money and patrons behind 
them “rod in pompous array.” 5 The Friars, not unready to 
criticise, complained that the University, like Eli, was declining 
into dotage and unable to see the errors of its sons.® 
For all that, the Statutes adopted in the fifteenth century, 
even if partly ineffective, are a proof that higher standards

remained. Apart from the special ordinances for the New 
Schools and the Library, the Chests and the Halls, there were 
fresh regulations for the election of University officials, fresh 
Statutes for Determiners and Inceptors,1 fresh orders to enforce 
attendance at lectures, to keep up disputations and to prevent 
their being curtailed.2 There were rules to define the duties 
of the Proctors, to secure the better keeping of the muniments 
and the better keeping of accounts.* There were rules to regulate 
the fees of Bedels. In 1433 a dispute over the election of a 
Bedel raised and decided a constitutional question. The two 
Proctors and four Masters of Arts elected one candidate, the 
Chancellor and Doctors of four Faculties another. The latter 
claimed that the votes of the Artists ought to count as one vote 
only. But Congregation resolved that the term majority meant 
not a majority of Faculties but a majority of votes.4 The 
Black Congregation may have lost its old importance, but the 
influence of the Artists was still too strong to set aside. There 
were rules to regulate the expenses of graduation. In 1443 the 
University admitted to the Archbishop of Canterbury that the 
cost of degrees was “‘ immoderate and disgraceful.” But in 1460 
it assured the King with less candour that it was not true that 
the Mendicant Orders were obliged to pay heavily for Inception, 
and that the costs at Oxford were no greater than at Cambridge.® 
There was an important group of ordinances passed in May 
1432, which summed up the law on a variety of subjects. There 
were rules for University sermons and for the better keeping 
of the University seal, rules to expedite the administration of 
justice and rules to regulate appeals.” Rules also about clothes 
were frequently required. Such was the iniquity of certain 
Bachelors that, in order to vary the fashion of their hoods, they 
would break their oaths and imperil their souls. Rules about 
precedence roused even stronger feelings. Doctors of Law and 
Doctors of Medicine each claimed to rank above the other. 
Bachelors of Law asserted their equality with Masters so persis- 
tently as to cause serious disputes. In 1435 the University 
appealed to the Duke of Gloucester and even to the King against 
the absurd presumption of the Bachelors. ‘‘ Discord, the step-

mother of the sciences and virtues,” was bringing the Chancellor’s 
authority into disrepute.1 There was clearly no want of subjects 
for legislation or reform. And if the authorities were not always 
successful in enforcing the precepts they laid down, they at 
least recognised the need of revising their methods, of laying 
stress on the University’s requirements, of trying to bring their 
turbulent community under more satisfactory control. 
Itis about the middle of the fifteenth century that the 
earliest Register of Congregation known to us begins.? Faded 
and imperfect as it is, its entries are yet full of interest. There 
are notes of some eleven hundred students between 1448 and 
1463, of the degrees they sought, of the conditions imposed upon 
them, of the Graces they secured. There are many requests 
about the books to be read. One is allowed to dispense with 
Euclid, another to read the De Anima instead of the Georgics, 
another to study ‘‘ Ptholomeus in Quatripartis ’’—all perhaps 
that a reasonable astronomer could require. There are many 
provisions about fees: contributions to the paving of the 
University Church or the completion of the Divinity School 
mark the stages in an academic course. There are many mis- 
cellaneous notices. A Proctor is mortally wounded in an affray 
between Peckwater Inn and St. Edward’s Hall. An Archdeacon 
of Bath is munificent in his subscriptions. A Master of St. 
John’s Hospital is banished for his misdemeanours and for 
breaking prison.* The records, no doubt, are incomplete. The 
Scribes or Registrars did not always do their duty, though 
Congregation voted them small fees for entering the names. 
In 1458 indeed John Farley, the Scribe, was so accomplished 
that he could write his name in Greek letters, which did credit 
to a New College man. But a century later Thomas Keys or 
Caius, famous for his audacities in writing Oxford history, so 
disgraced himself by staying away from Congregation and by 
his carelessness about his entries and his dues, that the University 
had to expel him from office. Keys, it is sad to relate, lost his 
temper, and smacked the face of a Master who was ordered to 
detain him. He was sent to prison to purge his misconduct, 
but survived to become Master of University College—no unfit 
place for a mythologist—in 1561.5 The old Registers are full of

FIFTEENTH CENTURY OXFORD 341 
human touches. Much more than the routine of medieval 
Oxford lives in their attenuated lists. 
Many of the University’s letters written in the fifteenth 
century are preserved in the manuscript volume in the Archives 
known as Registrwm F.1 They are full of wordy rhetoric, of 
exaggerated metaphor, of high-flown compliment, after the fashion 
of the times. Humphrey of Gloucester is a “ light-bearing star 
and a most unshakeable column.”’ His liberality is a heavenly 
inspiration, his life and morals an example to the world. Earl 
Tiptoft of Worcester is as upright as he is eloquent. The Bishop 
of Salisbury is a raft in shipwreck. The Archbishop of Canter- 
bury’s glory blinds the University as owls are blinded by the 
sun.2, When Edward IV sends his nephew Edward Pole to 
Oxford, “‘ the noble infant so eagerly desired,” the University’s 
emotions can hardly be restrained within the limits of the Latin 
tongue. When Pole’s companion, Stanley’s brother, is dis- 
covered after Bosworth to be a great personage in the State, 
the University protests that, while not quite an Aristotle or an 
Augustine, he is only less dear to it than Stanley’s son. And 
yet through all this adulation a good deal of independence shows. 
The University rarely hesitates to stand up for its liberties and 
tights. It declines to re-admit offenders, even though the King 
desires it. It is very reluctant, even after Bosworth, to hand 
over a Bishop who is a political refugee. It will allow no 
invasions of its jurisdiction. It would rather die, it tells the 
Archbishop, than allow its privileges to be violated or broken.® 
It speaks its mind, in spite of circumlocution, whenever its real 
interests need defence. 
The burden of many of the letters is of course the want of 
funds. Poverty is the ‘‘ execrable step-mother of study.” The 
University, once so famous, has in 1438 and 1439 become squalid 
andsad. Few students now wish to come to Oxford. The Halls 
and Inns are empty or destroyed. The doors of the Schools are 
closed. Not a thousand scholars are left. Thirty years later only 
the intercession of St. Frideswide can save the University from 
periland decay. Learned men seek in vain for preferment. The 
wisest teachers and the most industrious students are left to 
languish in want until old age.* Again and again the University

pleads for relief from taxation, especially for its unbeneficed 
clerks. Again and again it presses on the Heads of the Church 
the urgent need of more benefices for its Masters, if learning is 
to live. Once at least, in 1450, it is startled by an alarming 
rumour that Parliament is meditating the resumption of all 
Royal grants of land for pious uses. This would have meant 
ruin for the Colleges, and strong protests were sent up to Parlia- 
ment, to the Lord Chancellor and to the Duke of York, from 
the “moder, lanterne, and welle” of the clergy, in metaphors 
which must have touched the stoniest hearts.1 The Lords were 
appealed to in Latin. With the Commons forcible English was 
sometimes thought more likely to prevail. And once or twice 
one is led to suspect that the University, in its wish to stimulate 
charity, overstates the tale of its distress. But the general 
picture is scarcely painted too dark. There is no doubt that 
in fifteenth-century England the needs and anxieties of the 
University were serious enough. 
Meanwhile the old formulas were losing their authority. The 
old methods of scholastic disputation had fallen into disrepute. 
In the Arts Schools in Schools Street teaching, apparently, 
languished.? Many a fifteenth century student, 
“When through the casement sang the Spring,” 
found life less exciting in the lecture-room than out of doors. 
Many a fifteenth-century parent, no doubt, echoed the instinctive 
cry which has leaped to the lips of the English upper classes 
even in days less distant from our own: ‘I swear by God’s 
body I’d rather that my son should hang than study letters.” § 
Yet a new generation with new learning was arising. Ideas 
more captivating even than the springtime were laying hold of 
men. Far away in Italy the dawn had broken. A revolution 
more momentous than any change of dynasties had begun. 
Greek teachers from the East were gathering disciples. Greek 
manuscripts were flowing into the libraries of the West. Men 
of taste and fortune vied with each other in securing them. 
Delighted students, copyists, interpreters, translators, pored over ~~ 
their texts. The spell of Italy, always powerful with churchmen, 
drew scholars irresistibly over the Alps. From Oxford a remark- 
able group of students went to listen to the lectures of Guarino 
at Ferrara. Robert Fleming, Dean of Lincoln, whose uncle the 
Bishop had already founded Lincoln College, carried back precious 
manuscripts for the little College Library, and among them, no

doubt, his own Latin poems. An Oxford Professor has reprinted 
“three chaste and strong hexameters,’ in which Fleming 
celebrated the majesty of a far from venerable Pope.t William 
Gray of Balliol, not contented with studying at Oxford and 
Cologne, made his way by Florence and Padua to Ferrara, and 
there set up a splendid household till he moved on to Rome. 
Gray soon learned even better than Fleming to make use of 
Greek scholarship and Italian art, and brought back a far more 
famous store of manuscripts to enrich the Library of his old 
College. John Free of Balliol, a much poorer student, followed 
Gray to Ferrara, and made such a reputation by his learning 
that he was invited to write a new epitaph for Petrarch’s tomb. 
He was perhaps the most celebrated English scholar of his day. 
He made more money, however, by practising medicine, and he 
did not fear to produce a panegyric upon baldness,? an ailment 
which his medicines failed to cure. The Pope nominated him 
to an English Bishopric, but he died before entering into possession 
of his See. John Gunthorpe, it seems, accompanied Free from 
Balliol to Ferrara, and his fame for scholarship won him Royal 
favour and a succession of posts and embassies later. Head 
for a time of King’s Hall at Cambridge, he gave manuscripts 
both to Cambridge and to Oxford, and built himself at Wells 
a noble Deanery close to the Cathedral in which he lies. A 
greater personage, John Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester, was as quick 
as Gray to secure Italian treasures, as eager as Free or his 
fellow-scholars to learn all that Italy could teach. Even Arch- 
bishop Neville employed Greek scribes to copy manuscripts for 
him,? and his friend Bishop Shirwood of Durham brought from 
Rome a library of classics which Fox finally bestowed on Corpus 
College. 
The full effects of the Italian Renaissance were not seen in 
England till a generation later. They were visible earlier abroad, 
where John Wessel and Rudolph Agricola had come back from 
Italy to-lecture to the Heidelberg students, and where Hegius * 
was preparing himself to be schoolmaster to Erasmus. But 
before the Wars of the Roses were over the new influences were

  344 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
at work in Oxford life. Cornelio Vitelli had brought his Greek 
learning from Italy, and Warden Chaundler had invited him to 
New College,1 where his own good Latin was a source of pride. 
Grocyn, ‘‘the patriarch of English learning,’ had left New 
College for Magdalen, and was soon to be studying in the cities 
of the South. William Selling had travelled abroad and made 
friends with Politian. He had brought back the same love of 
Greek to his great Priory at Canterbury, and had made young 
Linacre a greater scholar than himself.2_ Another monk, Millyng, 
the well-known Abbot of Westminster, who gave sanctuary to 
Edward IV’s family and fed them with ‘‘ halfe a loaf and two 
muttons daily”’ in the hour of their distress, had learned still 
earlier at Gloucester College the scholarship which distinguished 
him in later years. John Colet, a grave boy, was already study- 
ing at Oxford. Linacre had just become a Fellow of Chichele’s 
foundation. William Lily was soon to be a member of Magdalen, 
and William Latimer was to follow Linacre to All Souls. The 
Schoolmen still held the fortress, but the New Learning was 
knocking at the gates. Dimly but surely the new spirit had 
begun to work. A few years more and even Colet would be 
condemning Aquinas for his “ preposterous philosophy,” and 
Erasmus, yawning over the ‘‘ accursed ”’ volumes of Duns Scotus,* 
would be wondering whether, while the world moved onwards, 
the teachers of theology had not fallen asleep. 
In the dawn of this new era a King, not too sure of his subjects, 
thought it advisable to treat the Oxford Masters as his friends. 
Richard III’s visit to the University was the last memorable 
incident in Oxford history before the Middle Ages passed away. 
The first of the Plantagenets had watched from his Palace 
at Beaumont the University beside him springing into life. 
The last of his House found it:deeply rooted in antiquity, even 
if its spirit and its numbers had recently declined. Richard 
‘like his brother stayed at Magdalen, and not in the Carmelite 
Convent which had once been the home of English Kings. In 
July 1483 he arrived from Windsor with a company of lords 
and Bishops, Lincoln and Surrey, Lovel and Stanley, Beauchamp, 
Audley and the rest. He was met, says Wood, by the Chancellor, 
1 About 1475. See Prof. Burrows’ article on Grocyn (Collectanea, 
II, 337 sq.). In Paris Greek is said to have been taught from 1458 (Crévier, 
L’Université de Paris, IV, 243 sq.). The earlier attempts to found Chairs 
for Greek and Hebrew at European Universities were missionary efforts 
to facilitate the conversion of Jews and Turks. 
2 On Selling see Gasquet (Eve of the Reformation, 24 sq.). Leland calls 
him “ Gulielmus Tilleus, alias Cellingus ’’ (De Script. Britan., ed. Hall, 
482-3). As a monk he could not have been at All Souls. 
8 The epithets are from Mr. Froude’s translation (Life and Letters of 
Evasmus, ed. 1910, 106 and 75).

Regents and Non-Regents at the town’s end, and “ honourably 
and processionably received into Magdalen College.” The 
University gave the party wine and gloves. Two days were 
spent in paying visits and in hearing disputations. Moral 
Philosophy and Theology, it seems, had a special interest for 
the King. The Muses “ crowned his brows with fragrant wreaths 
for his entertainment,’ and in return the Royal bounty was 
liberally displayed. Richard passed on with his retinue to 
Woodstock, leaving a grateful and submissive University behind. 
The town that King Richard saw had altered greatly since 
Queen Eleanor lodged at Beaumont and Fair Rosamund took 
refuge in her Nunnery beyond. But still on the low slope 
between the rivers the same close-set rectangle stood. The ancient 
walls still girdled it. The ancient parishes and churches for the 
most part still survived, though St. Mary’s was falling into ruin 
and schemes for its rebuilding were on foot.1 The town’s old 
liberties had dwindled as the privileges of the clerks within it 
grew. But it still had a bustling market and thriving trade. 
New towers and parapets, new chapels and quadrangles had 
encroached upon the old, narrow lanes. Others had spread 
beyond the town limits, where Balliol had set the example of 
building. All Souls was already beginning to mellow. At 
Magdalen the new-cut stone must still have been shining as 
white as the rose on the Founder’s tower. But the great bell- 
tower had not yet risen beside the Cherwell, to cast its spell 
on every traveller approaching from the East, and within the 
College precincts many relics of the older Hospital, of its buildings 
and gardens and meadows, remained. Passing West, beyond 
the ground where dead, forgotten Jews were lying, and entering 
the town by the East gate under battlemented walls, King 
Richard saw the main line of the High Street curve before him 
much as it curves to-day. To the left were the Saracen’s Head 
and the Tabard,? and other low-built timbered houses, where 
Waynflete had first housed the scholars of Magdalen Hall. To 
the right was St. Peter’s Church, where Edmund Rich perhaps 
had worshipped, and many a generation of priests and students 
since. Beyond lay Queen’s, still hidden from the High Street, 
University opposite, with its early, irregular court in great part 
recently rebuilt, All Souls in its new splendour, and St. Mary’s 
in woeful disrepair. Old Halls and Inns for students were 
scattered among the neighbouring streets. Schools Street ran 
between busy, noisy little buildings, but less busy and noisy 
than of yore, to the new Divinity School—with the still newer 
1 The chancel of course was already rebuilt—in 1462.

new Examination Schools.

Library above it—made ready perhaps for a disputation in the 
Royal presence. Further West again rose Exeter College, already 
venerable in its associations, with Lincoln, the new bulwark 
against heresy, just founded afresh by Rotherham’s munificence, 
and behind to the North-east lay the lofty walls of New College, 
no longer meriting its misleading name. Across the main street 
from St. Mary’s, where amid overhanging houses dark, ill-paved 
lanes ran to the South wall, the Oriel buildings stretched towards 
Merton. The Black Monks of Canterbury kept or forgot their 
vows. And St. Frideswide’s, sunk in immemorial slumbers, 
recked nothing of the Cardinal destined to destroy it, who for 
his part, untainted by ambition, was still dreaming the dreams 
of childhood in his Suffolk home. 
But though the University overshadowed it, the vigour of 
the town survived. If St. Mary’s spire dominated the High 
Street, St. Martin’s at Carfax was the centre of municipal life. 
There the Craft of Tailors had their chantry and an upper 
window emblazoned with their shears. The tailors’ shops were 
mostly, it seems, in St. Michael’s parish, and on St. John’s eve 
they made merry, sometimes too merry, with dance and music, 
“caressing themselves with all Joviality in Meats and Drinks.” 
The Company of Barbers had their customs also. They paid 
to keep a light for ever burning in Our Lady’s Chapel at St. 
Frideswide’s. On Sundays they shaved none but those who 
had religious duties to perform.t The Cooks had only lately 
secured incorporation and the Chancellor’s sanction for their 
feast at Whitsuntide. If King Richard rode up the High Street 
he must have found the various traders in their stations, as the 
regulations of the market and the town required. The Market 
Ordinance of 1319 had placed the sellers of straw with their 
teams in the middle of the highway between East Gate and All 
Saints’ Church. The sellers of pigs were to be on the North 
side between All Saints’ and St. Mary’s, with the sellers of wood 
opposite on the South side of the street. The sellers of ale were 
a little further West, and the glove-sellers also, between All 
Saints’ and the Mitre. The sellers of bread and milk and eggs 
and butter were posted about Carfax, where the throng was 
thickest. The butchers had stalls in the High Street, though 
Butcher’s Rows grew up elsewhere. The drapers gathered 
round St. Martin’s, the corn-sellers towards North Gate. The 
fishmongers and cooks were found about the Vintry in St. 
Aldate’s. But as time passed the rules for traders varied, and 
the old positions had, no doubt, altered to some extent by King 
Richard’s day. Beyond the South Gate, in the water-meadows, 
1See Boase (Oxford, 38 sq.). ’

-P-A-G-E-396

and Westwards where the broken streams wandered under the 
Castle walls, the Black Friars and Grey Friars had their quarters. 
Round to the North, beyond the Castle outworks, beyond 
Bocardo and the old town ditch, dwelt other Friars and monks, 
in Beaumont and in Gloucester Hall. St. Bernard’s College 
fronted on St. Giles’. Balliol and Durham College opened off 
Candich or Horsemonger Lane. Further East again the Austin 
Friars, outside Smith Gate, looked back across the walls to New 
College. Holywell was still a country manor, with its own 
church and green and mill and watercourses, but its old wool- 
market may have disappeared. Through all these streets,! past 
gate and bastion, church and tavern, shop and stall, a tide of 
young life flowed and ebbed, clerics and laymen, students and 
idlers, brawlers and dreamers, soldiers, citizens, packmen, women, 
monks, adding ever to the stir, the colour, the vivid picturesque- 
ness of the scene. The King who looked down upon the pageant, 
and received perhaps its unwilling tribute as he passed, was 
to end an era in its history, as he ended the great dynasty from 
which he sprang. With Bosworth Field a different chapter 
opens. A fresh wind rushes through the Schools. The old Gods 
begin to tumble from their places. New aims in learning and 
new conceptions of theology arise.

  CHAPTER IX 
THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 
LINCOLN, ALL SOULS, MAGDALEN 
AND OTHERS 
F the three Colleges founded in the fifteenth century* 
Lincoln, designed as a protest against heresy, was the 
least fortunate in the chances of its birth. Richard 
Fleming, the Bishop who began it and who named it from his 
See, is not at this date an easy man to judge. In his earlier 
years he was conspicuous in Oxford. A handsome Yorkshire- 
man* from University College, he served as Northern Proctor 
in 1407. He was responsible for the preparation of the Junior 
Proctor’s book.? He regulated and perhaps reformed the 
system of disputation. He was actively concerned in University 
business. And, unless his contemporaries misjudged him, he 
was at one time a supporter of some of Wycliffe’s views. Arch- 
bishop Arundel at any rate had no doubt that Fleming was an 
opponent of his own. He denounced him as no wiser than the 
beardless boys who tried to teach before they knew how to spell, 
and he overwhelmed with ecclesiastical thunders the damned 
conclusions which they damnably espoused. Yet within a 
few years of this sweeping censure Fleming is found, with 
Repington, who was clearly an old Wycliffite, active on the 
orthodox side. He received encouraging preferment. In 1420 
he succeeded to Repington’s great Bishopric at Lincoln.’ In 
1423 he appeared as spokesman of the English Church abroad. 
He won the Pope’s favour by championing the Papacy. He 
1 That is, founded to endure. St. Mary’s and St. Bernard’s belonged 
to the same era, but have passed away. 
2“ Juvenis forma speciosus,” says his epitaph (Wood, Colleges, 235), 
and the statement has been unkindly attributed to the Bishop himself. 
* For an account of this book see Anstey (Mun. Ac. 237-9). 
“See Wilkins (Concilia, III, 322). For Fleming’s life see the Intro- 
duction to the Visitations of Religious Houses (Lincoln, I) published by 
the Canterbury and York Society, and the sketch drawn and the authori- 
ties quoted by Dr. Poole in D.N.B. 
5 He was nominated by the Pope in 1419 (Le Neve, Fasti, ed. Hardy, 
II, 17). It is quite likely that Fleming’s differences with Arundel were 
political rather than theological. Repington’s change of opinion is better 
established. 
348
-P-A-G-E-398
    THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 349 
secured from Martin V a nomination to the Archbishopric of 
York. And though the King’s Council refused to sanction this 
promotion, Fleming’s attachment to ecclesiastical authority 
steadily increased. In 1427 he received the Royal license to 
found a “little College of theologists” at Oxford, to defend 
the cause of orthodoxy against the “ swinish snouts” who 
presumed to feed upon its precious pearls.1 And before he 
died he cleared himself for ever from all suspicion of the like 
profanity by digging up Wycliffe’s bones at Lutterworth and 
throwing them into the Swift. 
Fleming’s opinions and his reasons for revising them may 
after five centuries be allowed to rest in peace. But the Bishop 
had little beyond the soundness of his doctrines to bequeath 
_ to the College he designed. He obtained leave from the Crown 
to unite the three Oxford parish churches of All Saints’, St. 
Mildred’s and St. Michael’s by the North Gate, and to establish 
in All Saints’ a College consisting of a Rector and seven Scholars.* 
St. Mildred’s Church disappeared. Its churchyard and some 
buildings near it went to form a site for the new foundation. 
Two Chaplains were appointed to serve the two churches that 
remained. As King and Parliament and Primate, the Arch- 
deacon of Oxford and the Mayor and the parishioners apparently 
approved of this arrangement, no one else had a right to complain. 
But the revenues forthcoming must have been very scanty 
even counting all church offerings, fees and Sunday pence. 
Fleming’s charter creating the College and appointing the first 
Rector was dated December 1429. He seems to have begun 
_ the buildings and to have started the Library. He reminded 
himself that Ovid had promised: immortality to men who carried 
through great designs. 
“Tale opus hic feci, quod ego per szcula cuncta, 
Si quid habent veri ratum presagia, vivam.”’ 
But he died suddenly in January 1431, before his plans were 
completed, and the life of his little foundation was left hanging 
in the balance for some years. 
John Beke, however, the second Rector, appointed in 1434, 
proved a strong and energetic ruler. He secured powerful 
assistance. The Archdeacon of Oxford gave a “‘ notable sum of 
money.” John Forest, Canon of Lincoln and Dean of Wells, 
undertook to build a Chapel and a Library, a Hall and kitchen, 
1See Fleming’s Preface to the Statutes (Stats. of Oxford Colls., 
Lincoln, 7). 
2See the wording of Henry VI’s license (Ib. 4-6). Fleming was 
empowered ‘‘ easdem ecclesias sic unitas, annexas, et incorporatas, Eccle- 
siam Omnium Sanctorum nominare; et eandem ecclesiam in ecclesiam 
collegiatam sive Collegium erigere.”

and chambers above and below. Parishioners and neighbours 
were induced to help. A house or two in Oxford, an estate at 
Botley, the venerable mill at Iffley, far more venerable to-day, 
a grant from Cardinal Beaufort’s executors, and lands and gifts 
from other sources were secured. Before Beke was succeeded 
by Tristropp as Rector in the early months of 1461, the modest 
little “‘ College of the Blessed Mary and All Saints of Lincoln 
in the University of Oxford ”’ was fairly on its feet. The Founder 
had proposed a Society consisting of a Rector, seven Scholars 
and two Chaplains. Another Scholar or Fellow was nominated 
to pray for a special benefactor’s soul. A Bible-clerk, a chorister 
from Lincoln, was appointed, to wait at table, to read the Gospel 
and to say grace at meals. Still the danger of confiscation was 
not over. Courtiers were covetous and a Civil War was going on. 
George Neville had to be entreated to deliver the College from 
“greedy thieves of dogs and plunderers.” Edward IV con- 
firmed its rights by charter.1_ Tristropp, appointed in the difficult 
days when Edward was fighting to seize the Crown, proved 
equal to the task of defending his dominions. He secured a 
valuable donation from the executors of Bishop Bekynton of 
Bath and Wells. Above all, Thomas Rotherham, Bishop of 
Lincoln, visiting the College in 1474, and moved by an eloquent 
and pitiful appeal, promised ‘“‘ with great love and affection ” 
to perfect the work which his predecessor had begun, and 
established on a sure foundation the house which Fleming had 
so scantily endowed.* 
1The wording of the charter of 1462 proved faulty, and another 
charter was needed in 1478, to prevent the extinction of the College. 
(See Clark’s Lincoln, 23 and 28.) 
2Dr. A. Clark’s Lincoln in the Oxford College Histories, to which I 
amconstantly indebted, is the chief recent authority for its annals, and 
is of course fuller and later than his article in the Colleges of Oxford. 
Wood’s sketch (Colleges, 234-51) is slight. Rotherham’s Statutes, pre- 
served in the College Archives in a copy signed by Rotherham himself, 
were printed in 1853 from copies in the British Museum and at Trinity 
College, Cambridge (Stats. of Colls. of Oxford, 1), together with Fleming’s 
Preface, the Royal Patent of Foundation, and the Darby Statutes of 
1537. The Second Report of the Historical MSS. Commission (130-2) 
gives some account of the College Archives. The most interesting docu- 
ments in the muniment room, which the Rector kindly allowed me to 
examine, include an early lease (1286) of a Hall between All Saints’ and 
St. Mildred’s, a conveyance of a toft to Fleming in July 1430, an agree- 
ment in regard to a gift of books by Thomas Gascoigne in 1432, letters 
and deeds relating to Beke the Rector and to patrons like Southam and 
Forest in 1437, and Edward IV’s confirmation of charters in 1462 and 
1478. Henry VI’s charter of October 1427 and Fleming’s charter of 
December 1429 are missing. But the substance of them is included, with 
other early documents of interest, in the volume of transcripts made 
probably about 1730 by William Vesey, a Fellow of the College. The

Theology, ‘“‘ empress and mistress of all Faculties,” was the 
study which Fleming had enjoined on his Fellows. He may have 
sketched some regulations for them. But it was left for Rother- 
ham in 1480 to draw up the code of Statutes, which with few 
changes governed the College for nearly four hundred years. 
Rotherham, himself, so far as we can judge him, stands out as 
a noble figure in ignoble times. Bishop of Lincoln,? Archbishop 
of York, Chancellor of the Kingdom, a great lawyer and a great 
diplomatist, he was a powerful Minister under Edward IV and 
a faithful friend to Elizabeth Woodville in the hour of her 
distress. He was a faithful friend also to both Universities, 
though Cambridge has the better right to claim him as a son, 
large-handed in his gifts for education, munificent in the buildings 
which he planned. The number of Fellows at Lincoln was 
raised to twelve, exclusive of the Rector. New endowments 
were procured to support them. Dagville’s Inn in the High 
Street took the episcopal sign of the Mitre when it passed into 
the possession of the College. It brought with it the garden 
where now the Oxford market stands. Gradually the little 
Society’s resources increased. Compared with New College or 
with Magdalen, it still remained a very poor foundation. But 
it was able to maintain its members and to perform the services 
required.* 
Rotherham’s Statutes provided that the Fellows should 
nearly all be chosen from the dioceses of Lincoln and of York.® 
They were intended to be graduates; Bachelors of Arts were 
to be elected only if Masters failed. All Fellows, save one 
Canonist, were to be students of theology. They were to take 
most important College Register runs from 1577 to 1739, and though 
very empty during the Civil War is often full of interest. But an older 
Register, sometimes rather casual and scrappy, contains entries of an 
earlier date. The Bursars’ Accounts run from early years; and among 
the fourteen volumes of MS. collections for the College history left in 
the Bodleian by Dr. Clark there are seven volumes of notes taken from 
the College accounts and full of interesting details. Dr. Ogle made in 
1893 a catalogue of all the documents then in the muniment room of the 
College. The question of saving them from damp is urgent, both at 
Lincoln and elsewhere.

by the Founder (Statutes, Lincoln, 12).

College revenues at £877, and Lincoln revenues at {101 (Clark, Lincoln,

Priest’s Orders, to become Bachelors of Divinity within eight 
or nine years of their necessary Regency, and Doctors within 
six years more. The Doctorate, a long, expensive business, 
may have proved for some a counsel of perfection; but there 
were plenty of clerical duties for the Fellows to perform— 
prayers for the souls of benefactors, celebrations in the Chapel, 
commemoration of the College Saints. Services also had to be 
arranged for the churches which the Society owned, All Saints’ 
and St. Michael’s in Oxford, Twyford and Combe Longa outside.+ 
For training in study disputations were provided, and rules for 
reading and the use of books laid down. A Sub-Rector helped 
to govern the College, a Treasurer or Bursar saw to its accounts. 
The Sub-Rector, it seems, was the Corrector also, and kept a 
four-tailed scourge to discipline his colleagues.2_ Two important 
yearly chapters, for elections, for business and for questions of 
conduct, were ordained. Fellows incorrigibly incontinent or 
criminous were to be deprived. Above all, ‘‘ diseased sheep,” 
tainted with pestiferous heresies, were to be turned out of the 
sheep-fold. Regular residence in Oxford was expected, except 
for six weeks in the Long Vacation. The Fellows’ commons 
were fixed at sixteen pence a week. They had rooms rent free. 
They shared the services of the College servants, the manciple, 
the barber, the laundress and the cook.? They might earn 
something by attending services. They might hold property 
and benefices of small value which did not involve residence 
or duties elsewhere. And as time passed other small allowances 
or pittances, for clothing, food and pay dropped in.4 The Rector 
was the only College officer who might hold preferment. He 
and the other officers had salaries allotted to them, the Rector 
forty shillings, the Sub-Rector and Treasurer thirteen shillings 
and fourpence each. The Rector also had an honest clerk to 
serve him and to read the Bible during meals, who received 
board and lodging, shaving and washing at the Society’s expense. 
Commoners admitted by the Sub-Rector were allowed to attend 
disputations, and a few Commoners must have shared in the 
life of the College, though not in its endowments, almost from 
the first. But there was no other provision for teaching out- 
siders, and the tutorial system was still far to seek. 
1 Rotherham apparently intended the Fellows to help in all four 
churches (Jb. pp. 22, 29, 30). At All Saints’ and St. Michael’s special 
duties were assigned. An occasional English sermon had to be preached. 
2See Clark (Lincoln, 208). 
The Darby Statutes later speak of a manciple, bible-clerk, barber, 
cook and poor scholar as common servants. 
¢ Dr. Clark gives a list of these small endowments (Colls. of Oxf. 185-7).

  THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 353 
Rotherham saved and re-established the College, and under 
the early Tudors the quiet tide of prosperity flowed on. Fresh 
lands and benefactions increased the College revenues. Bishop 
Smyth of Lincoln gave five hundred acres. Bishop Audley of 
Salisbury gave money for lands and built a chantry chapel in 
Salisbury Cathedral to be served by a Lincoln man.t Arch- 
deacon Darby of Stow founded three new Fellowships. Had 
not the Fellows had an unfortunate knack of offending their 
well-wishers, their revenues, it seems, would have been enlarged 
still more. Later on, in 1568, Mrs. Trapps, the widow of a famous 
London goldsmith, left funds to provide for four poor scholars, 
who ranked below the Fellows and Commoners, and who were 
expected to wait at table and to render some service in considera- 
tion of the privileges which they received. One of the Trapps 
Scholarships was connected with Sandwich: the Master of the 
Elizabethan Grammar School at Sandwich was nominated by 
the College: and two other Scholarships founded in the seven- 
teenth century established afterwards a connection with Leicester. 
But the Tudor age had special perils for a College concerned to 
defend the ancient faith. Beke and Tristropp must have been 
strong rulers, but there is little to say of their immediate successors 
till Rector Cottisford in the sixteenth century found himself 
called on to take sharp measures against the early Reformers. 
Cottisford was Commissary or Vice-Chancellor in 1527, and he 
lived through many changes. He had to obey the orders of 
Wolsey and the still more difficult requirements of the King. 
His attempt to imprison Thomas Garret, for circulating Tyndale’s 
New Testament in Oxford, in a cellar underneath his Lodgings 
where the salt fish for fasting-days was kept, added a touch of 
comedy to the serious controversies of his day.® 
Cottisford figures with others in the accounts kept by the 
Bursars, which from the fifteenth century onwards are full of 
interesting details. We have notes of receipts from rents and 
from collections in the College churches. Rents in kind—apples, 
bacon, hens—are paid by the College tenants. Rents of rooms 
vary from ten shillings, twelve shillings, twenty shillings in 1582 
to as much as forty shillings in 1612. But some are as low as 
six shillings or even four. And for special tenants in the Civil 
rooms in 1456. These ‘‘ Commensales ” may have brought in servitors 
(see Lincoln, 16, and Stats. cap. 3). 
1See Clark (Lincoln, 33-5). It was not till Tudor times that Dag- 
ville’s Inn, formerly Croxford’s Inn and afterwards the Mitre, fell in to 
the College, though the bequest dated from 1476 (Ib. 31-3). 
2 Their stipends seem to have varied from 53s. 4d. to 56s. 8d. or more 
(Ib. 47 and 146). They were limited to 56s. 8d. in 1655 (College Register 
from 1577, f. 1or*).

War they ran up to as much as three or four pounds. Rents 
of studies about 1612 began as low as four shillings and ran up 
to eighteen or twenty: the rooms evidently varied.a good deal. 
There must have been fireplaces in some chambers in the fifteenth 
century: chimneys were constructed in 1487. But the first use 
of sea-coal seems to be in 1656. Wooden beds in chambers are 
mentioned about 1510, a table-cloth, for the high table probably, 
a little earlier, table-towels about 1514. There are all sorts of 
little homely charges—twopence half-penny for spice to the 
potage, thirteen pence “for puddings and good ayle at the 
accompts’”’ in 1548. A few years earlier there is a note for 
making verjuice. A hundred years later two pounds and nine 
shillings are charged ‘“‘ for vinegar to Rector and Fellows for 
the whole yeare.’’ There are constant charges for wine, one for 
“‘whyne and streberries”’ for the Rector and guests in 1512. 
In 1571 a mustard-pot is mentioned, in 1655 tobacco. Other 
miscellaneous charges, for repairs, for mending the pump or 
the organ, for cleansing the dove-house, for rushes, tapers, 
liveries, are constantly appearing. We have an interesting note 
in 1550 of eighteen pence charged for “Sir Atkyns commons 
when he was in Bocardo,” and another about the same date 
“spent when we fysshed 2s. 6d.” In the Civil War there are 
many illuminating entries—‘‘ to the King’s trumpeter ivd.” 
“to the Prince’s footemen Ios.” . “for a kettle for “the 
magazine 5s.” ... “for keeping a soldier a month 17s. 6d.” 
Or again, in 1645, ‘‘ Dno. Regi pro militibus £3 18s.,” with the 
Rector’s over-trustful comment “ to be paid againe.” We have 
notes about the College vine, about the gardens, arbours, alleys, 
about the tennis court and butts. We hear of a summer-house 
in 1626, of rose-bushes in 1661, coming in perhaps, like the 
cushions in Chapel, with other luxuries of the Restoration. We 
have notes about the kitchen, the quadrangle and the Library : 
the librarian’s pay is ten shillings a quarter in 1641. Generation 
after generation the accounts bear their intimate, unfailing 
witness to the occupations and vicissitudes of College life.t 
Cottisford’s successor; Hugh Weston, reigned from 1539 to 
1556. He contrived to find security under King Henry. He 
was arrested under King Edward. But he triumphed in Queen 
Mary’s reign. Weston is notorious for presiding at the dis- 
putation which tormented Cranmer, Latimer and Ridley. His 
influence and preferments were considerable and included the 
Deaneries of Westminster and Windsor. If Pole’s charge of 
gross immorality was justified, Weston must have needed the

good of his soul. As the Reformation proceeded, the College 
fell under suspicion. The older members, it seems, dropped 
away. Graduates became so scarce that undergraduate Fellows 
had to be elected.1_ Rector Henshaw, who succeeded in 1558,? 
could not accept the views of Queen Elizabeth. In 1560 
Francis Babington of All Souls, who had only lately been made 
Master of Balliol, was appointed irregularly in his place, and 
three years later another outsider, John Bridgewater of Brase- 
nose, came in. But both Babington and Bridgewater clung to 
the old order and were ultimately driven to resign. Bridge- 
water fled to Douai, plunged into controversial theology and 
Latinised his name as ‘‘ Aquapontanus.” Several of his pupils 
at Lincoln shared his opinions and his exile. One of them, 
William Gifford, became Archbishop of Rheims. Another, 
Walter Harte, a Traps Scholar in 1571, lived to be hanged, 
drawn and quartered as an obstinate Romanist at York. These 
nominations to the Rectorship could not be thought satisfactory, 
whether Leicester was responsible for them or not. But in 
1577 John Underhill of New College was appointed by the 
Chancellor, in spite of vehement opposition from some of the 
Fellows, who protested to the Archbishop of Canterbury against 
“a straunge, preiudiciall, and terryble example to all elections 
in theyr common weale.’’ And even after Leicester’s death, 
the College was scarcely more fortunate in its selection. Under- 
hill’s successor, Kilby, was constantly engaged in quarrels with 
his colleagues. He seems to have prevented the election of 
new Fellows, so as to maintain the income of the old.? 
Numbers increased in spite of irregularities: the total on 
the books seems from Twyne’s statement to have risen to a 
hundred and nine in 1612.4 In 1606 Fellow-Commoners began 
to be admitted. But in the early seventeenth century brawling 
and drinking, quarrels and mismanagement were rife. The old 
College records are frank in their details. One Fellow, “ Sir’’ 
Lodington, who had scandalised the town, was sentenced to 
make an oration in Chapel on the perils of a dissolute life, and to 
set down also the chief questions in the third book of Aristotle’s 
1In 1555. Yet in the list of Fellows in the College Register in 1558 
only one is described as “‘ non graduatus ” (Clark, Lincoln, 42). 
2 Between Weston and Henshaw, Christopher Hargreaves, a well- 
known adherent of the Romanist party, intervened. 
3 But there may have been something to say for the reduction of - 
Fellowships in 1606, if their small value led to frequent resignations. 
4 But in 1605 the total was put at only fifty-four (Clark, Lincoln, 62). 
Remembering the accommodation, Twyne’s figures seem high ; but they 
are the same as Langbaine’s in 1651.

De Anima, “ painfully and studiously done by himself.” Another, 
Master Smyth, broke his great cudgel on the head of Master 
North, and owned that his conduct “ might rather have become 
the black tents of Kedar, than the schooles of the Prophets, 
or the Sanctuaries of the Muses.’’ Another, Master Watson, 
charged with drinking, urged that water daily took the strength 
of his body away. Another, John Webberly, afterwards Sub- 
Rector, had to pay a surgeon for healing the face of a colleague 
he had fought.1 Another “ sleighted and pisht at’ the Rector 
himself, and even told him that he spoke “like a mouse in 
a cheese”: the Rector in question unhappily enjoyed little 
respect. Kilby, though he had difficulties with his Fellows; had 
been an able man, Professor of Hebrew, one of the translators 
of the Bible, and a leader in the school of moderate Calvinism 
to which Prideaux, the well-known Rector of Exeter, belonged. 
But Paul Hood; whose Rectorship filled the long interval between 
1620 and 1668, and covered a very difficult period of College 
history, had no such merits to commend him. Hood was the 
first Rector to marry, and his critics did not miss the opportunity 
offered to their “scandalous and opprobrious”’ wit. He was 
no friend of Laud’s; and the energetic Chancellor, no doubt, 
found the College, as he found the University, “sunk from all 
discipline and fallen into all licentiousness.”’ Bishop Williams 
of Lincoln, the Visitor and benefactor of the College, had done 
his best to keep Laud out of the Chancellorship and to oppose 
his views in ecclesiastical matters, and Laud naturally found a 
good deal to disapprove of in the conduct and opinions of Lincoln 
men. 
When Laud fell, the College, as the Bursars’ accounts show 
us, played its part with others in the Civil War. Some Lincoln 
men fought for the King—Thomas Marshall, a future Rector, 
among them. They took their turn in the trenches. The 
College perforce entertained Royalist guests. The Sub-Rector 
John Webberly was a conspicuous supporter of the Royalist 
arty. Robert Sanderson was a conspicuous Royalist divine. 
The College plate found its way to the Royal Mint. But Lincoln 
was in the main a Puritan College. It elected at least one noted 
Puritan, Thankful Owen, on the very eve of the War. After 
the siege was over, Sanderson and Webberly took an active part 
in opposing the Visitors of the Parliament. Webberly went to 
jail, and both were expelled. But Hood, the Rector, proved 
much more submissive, and the majority of the College followed 
his example, The answers given to the Parliamentary Com- 
mission in May 1648 show that twenty out of twenty-six members

THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 357 
were willing to acknowledge if not to ‘‘ imbrase ” the Visitation.+ 
Influential Puritans like Thankful Owen and Robert and Joshua 
Crosse, no doubt, influenced the decision. But of the ten 
Fellows on the books in 1648 it seems that five were sentenced 
to expulsion, and by the end of 1651, what with changes and 
promotions, none of the original Fellows remained. The 
victorious party filled up the vacant places with nominees of 
their own. Two or three Cambridge men, “the dregs of the 
neighbouring University,’ were imported, noisy, hard-drinking, 
turbulent intruders who reflected little credit on their patrons. 
Preaching and praying became the fashion, with results not 
always visible in conduct. Economy was insisted on: the 
College barber was for a time put down. But in the end at 
Lincoln, as elsewhere in Oxford, Puritan discipline must have 
told. And one young member of the College at any rate, 
though he proved in the long run no self-sacrificing Puritan, 
set a useful example of hard work. Stimulated by the example 
of his own servitor, Nathaniel Crewe gave himself up to the 
closest application, and he was soon so well grounded in the 
classics that he could repeat an Iliad every week. 
Crewe went up to Oxford in 1652. With his ability, his 
wealth, his reputation, he became the most prominent figure 
at Lincoln. His hospitality made him popular. His political 
influence steadily increased. His father, a Member of the Long 
Parliament excluded by Pride and restored by Monk, secured 
a peerage at the Restoration. The son at Oxford was at least 
equally astute, and Hood, the old Rector, followed in his steps. 
Crewe remained at Lincoln when the Independent Fellows 
were ejected in 1660. He conformed at once to the new order. 
He dropped his “ plentiful beard”’ and his “‘ Scotch habit,” and 
came to Chapel in cassock and surplice like the best High Church- 
man of them all.5 In 1663, as Senior Proctor, he took part 
in welcoming King Charles. He secured Lady Castlemaine’s 
favour. He made himself acceptable to the Duke of York. In 
1668 he was elected Rector of the College, but he apparently

members of the College (Register, 506-8). But Dr. Clark is, no doubt, 
tight in thinking (112) that the number in residence in 1647-8 was less. 
In August 1660 five of the intruded Fellows were ejected (Ib. 133). After 
the Restoration and especially under Crewe’s rule the undergraduates 
increased.

continued to reside principally at Court. In 167z he became 
Bishop of Oxford, and next year he resigned the Rectorship 
after a banquet worthy of the popularity he enjoyed. A very 
pliant courtier, he soon exchanged Oxford for the wealthier See 
of Durham. When James succeeded his brother, Crewe could 
not live without the new King’s favour. He took a leading part 
in James’ measures against the Church, and on James’ fall he 
was prompt to desert him. In politics time-serving and ignoble, 
he yet remained a generous friend to his old College all his life. 
He cared for its studies, its buildings, its finances. He established 
its prosperity and left it a handsome portion of his wealth. His 
immediate successors, Thomas Marshall and Fitzherbert Adams, 
proved equally successful rulers. Marshall was as popular, and 
in proportion to his means as generous, as Crewe.1 Adams 
weathered the storms of the Revolution. He improved the 
College buildings. He introduced a better system of adminis- 
tration, leases for fixed periods, on the College estates. And 
both bequeathed to the Rectors of the eighteenth century a 
happy tradition of comfort and good feeling, which it was 
reserved for later days to weaken and disturb. 
Other figures with a place in history are counted among the 
sons of the College. Robert Sanderson, “ prince of casuists,” 
theologian, logician, antiquarian, entered Lincoln in the last year 
of Queen Elizabeth and lived to be a Bishop of the Restoration. 
He became Chaplain to Charles I. “‘ I carry my ears to hear other 
preachers,” said the King. ‘‘ But I carry my conscience to hear 
Dr. Sanderson.” He was turned out of his Professorship by the 
Parliamentary authorities, but he survived to welcome Charles 
II. Sir William Davenant, Poet Laureate between Ben Jonson 
and Dryden, was born in the Cornmarket, at his father’s tavern 
where Shakespeare used to stay. Tradition made him Shake- 
speare’s godson; gossip or scandal suggested a still closer tie. 
Davenant probably became a member of Lincoln in 1620. But 
he soon took service as a page at Court, and exchanged his 
“smattering in logic’”’ for the poetry and drama which were to _ 
make his name. Hopton may have been a Gentleman-Com- 
moner ; he became the best loved of all Royalist Generals. James 
Parkinson, a sharp-tongued democrat, who dared to praise 
Milton’s politics in days of Cavalier reaction, and who at last 
was expelled from both University and College, would have won 
more sympathy in earlier or later days. John Radcliffe began 
life at University but held a Fellowship at Lincoln for some years. 
He abandoned it to follow medicine, and started practice as a 
doctor with little capital beyond his phials, his skeleton, his

herbal, his reading and his ready wit. When wealth and fame 
came to him, Radcliffe did not forget his ties with Lincoln, 
but his most liberal gifts to Oxford were given elsewhere. 
George Hickes, also a Fellow of Charles II’s time, was a pioneer 
of Scandinavian studies. But he was better known as a stern 
and unbending High Churchman, always ready to suffer for his 
ideals. A schoolboy first in Yorkshire, an apprentice afterwards 
at Plymouth, a rebellious batteler under a Puritan President at 
St. John’s, a servitor at Magdalen, a tutor at Lincoln, Hickes 
might perhaps have been Rector of the College had not Radcliffe 
exerted himself to keep so ‘‘ turbulent” a Tory out.1_ The Whigs 
were then in the ascendant, and John Potter, a servitor at 
University in 1688 and afterwards a Fellow of Lincoln, was 
able to pass on to a great ecclesiastical career. His success 
gave the College a Primate of England in the eighteenth century, 
as William Gifford’s in the seventeenth had given it a Primate 
of France. 
The College buildings gradually extended over the land 
between Brasenose Lane and All Saints’ Church. St. Mildred’s, 
which once gave its name to the Lane, and one or two old Halls 
close by, were secured in the Founder’s lifetime. Other Halls 
and parcels of land were acquired before the fifteenth century 
closed. Fragments of one old Hall may still be preserved in 
the College kitchen. Another, lying further East along the 
Lane, was described as “ quite ruinated and turned into a 
garden.” Others again, fronting upon Turl Street, provided for 
extensions to the South.2. By 1437 the main lines of the first 
quadrangle had been laid. The North side along the Lane 
included the Library and Chapel, the buttery and kitchen, and 
various sets of rooms for Scholars. The gateway was upon the 
Turl. The Rector’s rooms and the Treasury were placed in the 
Tower above it. The Hall ran South from the buttery and 
formed the quadrangle’s Eastern side. The South side was at 
first left open for the sunshine. At the North-east corner, 
beyond the buttery and beyond the quadrangle, were the kitchen 
and the cook’s garden, where vegetables grew. The Hall, with 
its three mullioned windows on each side, its open roof of chest- 
nut timbers, and its brazier in the centre with a louvre overhead, 
was a lighter room in the fifteenth century than now. One 
window on the East side has been blocked by the fireplace and 
another by the new buildings of the Grove. But thenineteenth

exact (see Salter, Mun. Civ, Oxon. 204).

century has restored some of the beauties which the eighteenth 
century defaced. To-day the silver candlesticks, the only light 
permitted, illuminate a noble room, and on the panelling there 
hang among the pictures portraits of Fleming and Rotherham, 
of Williams and of Crewe. 
The old Chapel and Library stood close together, at right- 
angles to the Hall. Both were on the first floor. The Chapel 
or Oratory had four windows on each side It was licensed 
for celebrations in 1451, but it must have been finished some years 
before that. In the seventeenth century it was converted into 
the Library, and the old Library descended to the level of College 
rooms.? Bishop Fleming gave twenty-five manuscripts. Gas- 
coigne and others in early days gave more. Rector Marshall 
in the seventeenth century contributed a great store of political 
tracts. Robert Fleming’s classical manuscripts were among the 
first of the Library’s treasures, and Edward VI’s Commissioners 
have been accused of confiscating them with the College plate. 
Most of the books were chained to desks: a catalogue of 1474 
accounts for a hundred and thirty-five. Others could, after 
proper formalities, be borrowed by the Rector and Fellows.* 
Under the Chapel and Library‘ and in the buildings on the 
Turl were chambers for Fellows, with the usual small: studies 
attached. After Bishop Bekynton’s bequest in 1465 new Lodg- 
ings were built for the Rector at the South end of the Hall— 
two fine rooms with cellars below and an attic for a servant 
above. And in 1479 Bishop Rotherham completed the quad- 
rangle by adding the chambers on the South side, in which 
John Wesley was one day to be housed. 
It was not till the seventeenth century that a second quad- 
rangle was begun. Then another Rotherham, a Fellow of the 
College in Elizabethan years, took the chief part in founding an 
extension to the South along the Turl, and the West wing of 
the present Chapel quadrangle was set up. But it was left to 
Bishop Williams of Lincoln, whose portrait in the Hall deserves 
its prominence, to carry the project of a new quadrangle through. 
1The plaster ceiling, Dr. Clark suggests, may possibly conceal a 
timber roof (Lincoln, 11). 
2It is now divided into two and the windows have been altered. 
The Library was probably moved into the old Chapel before 1655, a 
little earlier than Wood says. Dr. Clark suggests that a large gift of 
books was the immediate cause (Lincoln, 126). Lord Crewe, the Bishop’s 
father, bore the cost. 
3 See Clark (Lincoln, 27-8) and Rotherham’s Statutes (21). 
“And over the Library too (Lincoln, 9). 
5 Wood (Colleges, 245) mentions a tradition that Sir Thomas Rether- 
ham’s benefaction was due to remorse for frauds which he had practised 
as Bursar, But Rotherham may be as innocent as Wolsey of a similar 
charge.

  THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 361 
Two staircases with rooms for Scholars were built on the East 
side in 1629. The money ran short, and some of the partitions 
had to be finished with canvas and faggots of gorse. A beautiful 
Chapel on the South side, a fine example of Jacobean Gothic, 
was consecrated in 1631, with cedar wood-work exquisitely 
carved; and with painted windows of a rare effectiveness and 
charm.1 The Lodgings for the Rector, who was now allowed 
to marry, were enlarged by taking in some rooms from the new 
court, and a “little patch of ground” was given him for a 
garden. In 1640 the College needed a new cellar, and that was 
provided under the Hall. After the Civil War money for im- 
provements was forthcoming still more freely. The two Crewes 
and Marshall and Adams are conspicuous among the benefactors 
of the time. The Library was now established in the old Chapel, 
and a Common Room for the Fellows was made underneath,? 
and was furnished with chestnut wainscoting in 1684. The 
Chapel was redecorated: its former services had been restored, 
not without rough protest from Puritan spirits. The leaden 
Devil still looked over the College from the gateway tower. It 
disappeared with some other old features in the eighteenth 
century; owing, it was said, to its too obvious resemblance to a 
contemporary Rector. But old custom still brings the parish- 
ioners of St. Michael’s through the College buildings, to beat 
their bounds on Ascension Day, and to drink their share of 
ground-ivy ale. The Chapel bell still ‘‘ swears” in short, sharp 
strokes, before it starts to toll the almanac, to remind worshippers 
of the passing of the month. And if the Devil has vanished 
from his niche above the gateway, the College shield; assigned

(Lincoln, 85-8) is worth noting, and also the useful plan which he gives 
(Ib. 82). For the consecration of the Chapel see Collectanea (IV, 136 sq.). 
The glass has been naturally attributed to one of the Van Linges, whose 
work it closely resembles; but their work was almost always signed. 
If not theirs, it is probably by another Anglo-Dutch artist of that school. 
It can scarcely be Italian work, as Wood suggests (Colls. 251), or German. 
The contemporary glass in the Chapel of Abbot’s Hospital at Guildford, 
in some ways very like it, may also be the work of one of the Van Linges.

monument of the great war which ruined, while it immortalised, 
the dynasty whom he served. He came from Highs Werrers in 
Northamptonshire, where an old tradition says that William 
of Wykeham found him in boyhood keeping his father’s sheep.* 
At any rate he went to school at Winchester in 1373,2 and was 
one of the early Fellows of New College in 1386. Ten years 
later he was a Doctor of Laws and starting on a prosperous 
legal career. He was soon rewarded with ecclesiastical prefer- 
ments after the fashion of the day. The Bishop of Salisbury 
proved a kind patron. The Pope befriended and employed him : 
Chichele never shook off the influence of Rome. The King drew 
him into the public service. In 1408 he was made Bishop of 
St. David’s. He attended the Council of Pisa. He was more 
than once Ambassador in France. Henry V, a firm friend, 
made him Archbishop of Canterbury on Arundel’s death, and 
Chichele on his side brought all his influence and enthusiasm 
to the support of Henry’s great schemes of policy and war. 
But he needed Henry’s strength to make him strong. In the 
next reign, with the boy King for his godson, Chichele proved 
hardly equal to the troubles which he had to face. He opposed 
the claims of Cardinal Beaufort. He struggled unsuccessfully 
against the claims of Cardinal Kemp. He failed, rather woefully, 
to withstand the demands of Martin V, who was bent on destroy- 
ing the Statute of Provisors. History has charged him with weak- 
ness in defending the Church of England against Papal preten- 
sions. He was happier in his administrative and judical work, 
in securing the rights of graduates to benefices, in upholding the 
authority of the spiritual Courts. He was happier still in his 
educational foundations, in suppressing alien priories and using 
their endowments for educational ends. A College at Higham 
Ferrers, benefactions to the University of Oxford, and the grant 
of land for St. Bernard’s College, proved to be only precursors 
of a larger plan. Chichele lived in advanced old age to build 
All Souls. In 1442, a venerable figure, full of infirmities and 
honours, he came to Oxford, to visit if not to consecrate the 
splendid Chapel of his new College. He issued its Statutes

% Wood (Colleges, 288, n.), whom Prof. Grant Robertson (All Souls 
College, 7) follows, places the dedication of the Chapel on St. Editha’s 
Day, September 1442. Sir H. M. Lyte (355) apparently puts it in October 
1442, and the D.N.B. early in 1443. The Senior Proctor’s Book merely 
says that the Archbishop was present at a “‘ visitation ’”’ of the Chapel 
in 1442.

just before his death. He had then been Archbishop of Canter- 
bury for nearly thirty years. His body, wrapped in a shroud, 
was laid in his own Cathedral, under a stately monument which 
the inheritors of his bounty have preserved.t 
About the end of 1437 Chichele secured a corner piece of 
land opposite the East end of St. Mary’s Church, where Cat 
Street joined the High, with a few shops and inns and tenements, 
especially an ancient dwelling known as Berfords Hall. In 
February 1438 the foundation-stone of his College was laid, and 
some three months later the King, to whom the Archbishop had 
surrendered his purchases, granted a charter of incorporation. 
A College consisting of a Warden and twenty Scholars was 
established in Oxford for study and prayer. They were to pray 
for the King and the Archbishop in life and in death, for the 
souls of Henry V, of Thomas Duke of Clarence, of the Dukes, 
Earls, Barons, Knights, Esquires and others who in the wars 
of the Kingdom of France had ended their lives, and for the 
souls of all the faithful dead. They were to be called ‘‘ Custos et 
Collegium Animarum Omnium fidelium .efunctorum de Oxonia,”’ 
or commonly “All Soulen College.” They were entitled to 
increase the number of their Scholars to forty, to elect their 
Warden and their colleagues, to acquire land to the value of 
three hundred pounds a year, to have common property and a 
common seal.2 A year later a Papal Bull approved the new 
foundation and granted it a Chapel of its own. In 1443 Oriel 
College, the patrons of St. Mary’s and the guardians of its parish 
tights, agreed to this arrangement in return for a payment of 
two hundred marks. Meanwhile the building of the College 
was begun. In 1442 the Warden and Fellows, housed at first 
in temporary quarters, were able to hear Mass in their own 
Chapel. Andas the first quadrangle, still substantially unaltered,? 
was completed, they entered into possession of their home. 
All Souls was not only a chantry with a noble Chapel to 
1 The authorities for Chichele’s life are cited in D.N.B. Dean Hook 
in his Lives of the Archbishops (vol. V, ed. 1867) may perhaps overstate 
his political importance. The Latin life by Arthur Duck (1617, tr. 1699) 
is of some value. 
2The Royal Patent, with its description of the site—‘‘ quoddam 
messuagium vocatum Berfordes Halle, nuper vocatum Charletonsyn’, 
sex shopas, et unam placeam vacuam eisdem annexam ’’—is given in the 
Statutes of the Colleges of Oxford (All Souls, 4-8), printed from the complete 
MS. in the Bodleian. Another MS. (Arundel MS. 147) containing the 
Statutes is in the British Museum. Chichele and his successors are to be 
co-Founders with the King—‘‘tanquam alteros Fundatores ’’—and 
Richard Andrewe, the first Warden, and seven other Scholars are named.

  commemorate the dead. It was an academic foundation for 
study and for training clerks.1_ Of the forty Fellows or Scholars, 
whose number was soon completed; twenty-four were to be 
students of ‘‘arts and philosophy or theology,” and sixteen 
were to be jurists studying the Civil and the Canon Law. 
Chichele had been a successful lawyer; the lawyers of the 
Middle Ages were a very important product of University life. 
Over them all a Warden was to rule, appointed by the Arch-— 
bishop of Canterbury from two candidates whom they presented 
to him. He was to govern the Society and to administer its 
property—with the Fellows’ help in matters of grave concern— 
and he was not, without special reason, to be absent from the 
College for more than sixty days in the year. The Warden 
drew a salary of ten marks. He had a servant of his own.? 
He used the College horses. He entertained strangers at his | 
table in the Hall. And a Vice-Warden or Sub-Warden was 
appointed to act in his absence, and to help him especially with 
the discipline of the House. 
Vacancies among the Fellows were to be filled by the election 
of students between the ages of seventeen and twenty-six. 
The Warden presided over their choice.6 They were to be clerks 
with the first tonsure, fit and disposed for the priesthood. They 
were to be men trained already in the rudiments of grammar 
and in plain song. They were to be of free condition and legiti- 
mate birth, of good character and conduct,® anxious to profit 364 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
1In the statement of its objects—‘‘ ad studendum et orandum ’”’— 
study comes first (Stats., All Souls, 4): but the duty of praying for the 
dead bulks large. It cannot be said that the Statutes show any remorse 
for Chichele’s support of the war, though they show regret for the loss 
of life and for the decay of England’s military power. 
2 But the Founder contemplated the possibility of Doctors and 
Bachelors in medicine too (Jb. 41, 48 and 109). 
: %“ Unum clericum seu alium servientem honestum,’’ who was to 
serve him at table, in Hall, in his room and elsewhere (Stats. 27). I find 
nothing to show that this clerk was intended to read the Bible in Hall 
or to serve in the Common Room, as Dr. Rashdall (II, 512, n.) and Mr. 
Grant Robertson (A/i Souls College, 19), in commenting on Dr. Rashdall, 
suggest. The Bible reading in Hall was to be done by a clerk of the 
Chapel (Stats. 35), and it would seem that he has a better right than the 
‘Warden’s servant to be regarded as the ancestor of the later Bible-clerks. 
“The College paid for its invited guests, 6d. at the Warden’s table, 
3d. at the Fellows’, and 2d. at the servants’ (Ib. 28). 
*The Warden was apparently to select—‘‘eligat et assumat ’— 
candidates nominated by the majority of Fellows, to fill up the vacancies ; 
and no one could be elected without his assent. Out of this, probably, 
his claim to a veto on elections grew. If the Warden and Fellows failed 
to fill up vacancies, the Archbishop might do so (Ib. 20-2). 
* “ Bonis conditionibus et moribus perornati’’ (Ib. 20). The phrase 
is taken from the New College Statutes: it was by no means uncommon. ”

  THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 365 
by their studies, and of three years’ standing in the University 
as students of Arts or Civil Law or both. Founder’s kin were 
to have a preference, to come first ; then natives of places where 
the College had property ; and then poor and indigent scholars 
studying in Oxford, according to the counties to which they 
belonged. All Scholars elected, except Founder’s kin, were to 
have a year’s probation before being admitted as full Fellows, 
and were to take, like the Warden, elaborate oaths.1 Two 
Bursars, an artist and a jurist, were elected to administer the 
College property, and were paid, like the Sub-Warden, a yearly 
stipend of twenty-six shillings and eightpence each. Two Deans, 
one a Master of Arts and the other a Bachelor of Law, were 
_ appointed with the same salary to superintend studies and morals. 
A Seneschal of the Hall was made responsible for purchases and 
expenses every week. Two senior Fellows helped the Warden 
to guard the College plate and jewels. We hear of Chaplains 
and clerks of the Chapel, whose duties are not very clearly defined ; 
but a clerk of the Chapel, or one of the undergraduate Fellows, 
might be called on to read the Bible during dinner. Chichele 
borrowed his Statutes largely from William of Wykeham, but 
he showed little of Wykeham’s zeal for education. All Souls 
was to be a College for students, not for teachers. It was to 
supply trained lawyers and trained ecclesiastics like its eminent 
Founder for the service of the State. 
In the Hall the Warden and Sub-Warden sat at the chief 
table, with the Masters in theology and the Doctors of law. 
The rest sat in order of precedence elsewhere. The allowance 
for commons varied from twelve to sixteen pence according to 
the price of corn, with some addition on feast-days ; the Warden 
had a double share. The regular customs prevailed in Hall, 
Scripture reading, Latin talk; and on special occasions songs 
and poems and tales of wonder sung or told around the fire. 
Visits from strangers were closely regulated. None might pass 
a night in College. Careful rules were made for disputations.? 
All Fellows were to take degrees. Masters of Arts were 
expected to go on to the study of theology, and were required 
to take priest’s Orders within two years of completing their 
Necessary Regency. Bachelors of Civil Law who turned to 
the Canon Law were also to take Orders, but they were given

the “‘ Socii,’? mentioned in the Statutes. 
* In 1651 we hear of a “ ryding Bursar ” being nominated, not for the 
first time, ‘‘ for the better carrying on of affaires ” (Grant Robertson, 127).

a longer time. Those who became Doctors of Civil Law need 
not become priests. Dress in College and outside it was 
elaborately regulated according to custom and degree. Gowns 
and their appurtenances were minutely measured.4 A livery 
or suit of clothes, which nobody must think of pawning, was 
to be provided, if funds allowed, for the Warden and Fellows 
once a year: the Probationers had to find their own. Leave of 
absence was limited. Walking alone was severely discouraged. 
Daggers and swords, dicing and gaming, hawks and hounds and 
ferrets were forbidden things. Concord was enjoined, prayers, 
requiems and Chapel-services arranged for. There were regula- 
tions for the common chest, the common property, the grant of 
leases, the keeping of jewels. There were provisions for the use 
and loan of books—of law-books in particular—for registering 
and marking all that belonged to the College. The Society's 
servants were enumerated—a manciple, a butler,? a principal 
cook with two assistants, a porter who acted as barber also, 
and a boy to look after the horses, All must be males, “ to 
avoid sinister suspicion,’ but, as usual, failing a masculine 
laundress, a washerwoman was allowed. One of the College 
servants was to carry books to the Schools for the Fellows and 
to act as gardener at other times. Doctors of all Faculties 
might keep servants in College at their own expense. The 
Archbishop of Canterbury was to be the College Visitor, with 
large powers of interference and correction. College meetings 
and scrutinies, to read the Statutes and reform abuses, were to 
be held at least three times a year. Fellows were disqualified 
by entering ‘religion,’ by serious lapses in belief or morals, 
by acquiring property or benefices of a certain value,? by impedi- 
ments to study such as the possession of a wife. But the Warden 
was allowed to hold benefices freely, so long as he resided in College 
and fulfilled the duties of his post. 
The endowments of Chichele’s College came largely from 
alien priories which had been suppressed. Abbey lands in Kent 
and in Northamptonshire, in Shropshire and in Wales, bought, 
it seems, by the Archbishop, were granted to the College by the

interesting details in regard to the College officers and servants. 
8 Private property worth roo shillings a year disqualified (Stats. 67). 
I do not follow Dean Rashdall’s suggestion (II, 512, n.) that the peculiar 
history of All Souls has been partly due to “ the Founder’s omission to 
fix a definite property-limit.” On this point see Grant Robertson (Ali 
Souls Coll. 27-30). On the other hand, the Ordinances of 1549 suggest 
that the property-limit was not enforced (Siats. 86).

King. Edward IV, who had no love for a Lancastrian foundation, 
threatened to resume them, but he was successfully appeased. 
The College devoted its prayers to Yorkist Princes, till Henry 
VII's accession enabled it to pay honours to his “ blessed uncle’s” 
soul once more. Manors in Buckinghamshire were added, and 
woodlands in Middlesex near Willesden and Edgware. Other 
gifts of land and money, of plate and books and vestments 
flowed in. Henry VI is said to have given twenty-six volumes 
to the Library. Chichele himself established a Chest for loans 
to the poorer members of the College. By the time of Henry VIII 
the College revenues had risen beyond the sum suggested in the 
Royal Patent and nearly touched four hundred pounds. In 
the sixteenth century the Rectory of Stanton Harcourt was 
granted to All Souls by Cardinal Pole.1 Sir William Petre 
secured for it also the Rectory of Barking, and a piece of land 
beside the College, where the Rose Inn stood and where the 
Warden’s garden was made. Through Petre’s agency apparently 
some small exhibitions for poor Fellows and Scholars were 
founded.* And in the years which followed grants from other 
donors substantially increased the funds of the College, and 
swelled its surplus revenues to a total of which the Visitors 
found it difficult to dispose. 
The early Wardens—Andrewe, an active diplomatist who was 
soon appointed Secretary to the King, Keyes, an active builder 
whom Henry VI carried off to Eton, Kele, afterwards Archdeacon 
of Bath and Wells, Poteman, another Royal agent and official— 
had little time to leave their mark on the College. Stokys had 
a much longer reign, from 1466 to 1494, before he retired to a 
Canonry at Windsor. His successor Hobbys was a strong man, 
it seems, alike in quelling Oxford disorders, in resisting irregular 
demands for taxation, and in evading irregular nominations of 
Fellows by the Court.4 A Royal request for a loan from the

? Petre, a generous benefactor of Exeter, befriended All Souls in more 
ways than one. Prof. Oman (Colls. of Oxford, 219) attributes the pur- 
chase of the Rose Inn to Hovenden. Hovenden’s own statement, quoted 
by Grant Robertson (73), suggests that Petre bought the ground and that 
the Warden laid it out. But a letter from Archbishop Parker to Warner, 
quoted by Mr. Martin (Archives of All Souls, 304), advises the College to 
sell plate to buy the land to the cost of which Petre had promised to 
contribute. 
3 Five in all, varying in value from 26s. 8d. to 53s. 4d., and drawn in 
part from the Pouncett estates of which Petre was an executor (Wood, 
Colleges, 263, n.). Three exhibitions for poor Scholars founded by Edward 
Napper and his son were revived by Whitgift in 1602 (Stats. 106). 
4A request from Prince Arthur, if it really was from him, for the 
election of William Pickering seems to have had no effect (see Burrows, 
Worthies of All Souls, 38-40).

College towards the expenses of invading Scotland, produced a 
frank statement by the Warden that he could not lend forty 
shillings without borrowing it first.1 Broke, elected in 1503, is 
described by Wood as Principal or Moderator of the Canon Law 
School,?:a School which in medieval Oxford produced little 
original work. Coale in a brief reign built and endowed a school 
at Faversham, with whose fortunes the College is still connected, 
and in the same period another Fellow endowed a school at 
Berkhampstead. Stokeley in 1534, with the unanimous assent of 
his colleagues, accepted the Royal Supremacy and agreed to 
renounce the authority of the Pope. From such perilous problems 
he may have turned with relief to despatch two Fellows to 
Cambridge, to dispute whether Civil Law was more excellent 
than Medicine, and whether a woman condemned to death and 
twice strung up to the gallows ought, if the noose broke, to be 
hanged over again. Under Stokys and Hobbys the ‘‘ scrambling 
and unquiet”’ fifteenth century ended at All Souls with a touch 
of splendour. Linacre, equally great as scholar and physician, 
had been elected a Fellow in 1484. William Latimer, elected 
a few years later, was a classic who won the admiration of 
Erasmus. Under Henry VIII John Leland, one of the first of 
antiquaries and a master of ‘ British, Saxonish and Welsh,” 
came from Cambridge to All Souls for study, and Thomas Keys, 
a Fellow in 1525, began the researches into the antiquity of 
Oxford which were to make him the intrepid champion of many 
misleading, long-enduring myths. 
In these early days the Fellows changed often; there were 
fatter pastures to be found elsewhere. Discords arose. At 
a very early date we hear of troubles and resignations. Arch- 
bishops did not hesitate to intervene with Injunctions, to remove 
abuses or to interpret rules. Archbishop Stafford granted an 
indulgence which made the Chapel a place of pilgrimage.5 Many 
came to pray there and to see its treasures, the tooth of John 
the Baptist, the beryl set in St. Jerome’s mouth. Stafford has 
1 Martin (Archives of All Souls, 302). 
2 Wood also speaks of Poteman (Colleges, 268) as Moderator of the 
Civil Law School. 
* The College Register has the startling statement that in 1440 four- 
teen Fellows resigned and were replaced by fourteen new ones in 1441. 
This is repeated in an entry in the Register in the Warden’s keeping. 
«And the Prior and Chapter of Christ Church, Canterbury, claimed 
the right of Visitation during a vacancy in the See. Counsel’s opinion, 
taken by them on this point about the end of the fifteenth century, 
is among the records of the Chapter Library at Canterbury (O. 138, f.). 
5 But the evidence for the 9,400 wafers alleged to have been con- 
sumed at the obit of Isabella, Lady Shottesbroke in 1457, is hardly strong 
enough to build on. (See Burrows, Worthies, 31-2.)

been accused of depriving the College of some of its possessions? : 
others were forcibly occupied in the Wars of the Roses. He 
certainly regulated the election of College officers and allotted 
College rooms. With only sixteen rooms for forty Fellows, 
this may not have proved an easy task: but jurists and theolo- 
gians were carefully mingled, in order to promote charity and 
friendship. Archbishop Bourchier in 1459 had to insist on the 
Fellows paying their battels more promptly. Morton had to 
regulate the services in Chapel : his elaborate Injunctions suggest 
that brawls were not unknown. Warham appointed a salaried 
officer? to see that the theological disputations were properly 
carried out. He had reason to complain of quarrels at elections, 
of members of the College holding on to Fellowships and benefices 
together. Already the charge of “regarding family more than 
merit ”’ was levelled—and by an Archbishop—against All Souls, 
Worse than that, the practice of corrupt resignations was beginning 
to grow up. Retiring Fellows were allowed to nominate their 
successors—in other words to sell their places to men who could 
afford to pay. In 1541 Cranmer intervened with vigour. A 
Visitation was held. New regulations insisted on discipline and 
order in the Chapel, on the obligation of residence, of disputations, 
of degrees. Brawls and scandals, tippling and boozing, described 
with a great wealth of language, were put down. All trafficking 
in College elections was condemned. Long gowns and plain 
shirts were sternly recommended. There was to be no more 
commuting the livery into money. And there was to be no 
introduction into College of such elements of mischief as dogs 
and boys and adolescent youths.? 
Though Stokeley and his colleagues had “ with one mouth 
and voice’’ accepted Anne Boleyn and renounced the Pope, 
All Souls like other Colleges had to face the dangerous vicissitudes 
of Tudor times. John Warner, who became Warden in 1536, 
and who returned to office after Elizabeth’s accession, was a 
remarkable figure, endowed with all the supple tenacity which 
the public men of his day needed. He was the first Regius 
2Grant Robertson (35). But Warden Warner’s charge is rather 
vaguely directed against ‘‘the Archbishop of Canterbury succeeding 
Henry Chycheley, either next or shortly after ’’ (Stats. 122). 
*“Rectorem disputationum theologorum ” (Stats. 76). The Injunc- 
tions of the Visitors are printed after the All Souls Statutes in the first 
volume of the Statutes of Colleges published in 1853. Cranmer’s and 
Whitgift’s are important, and the Ordinances of 1549. Others are given 
in Mr. Martin’s catalogue of the College Archives.

one members in 1552 (Boase, Register, I, xxiii).

Professor of Medicine.1 He went on an embassy to France. 
He served and survived under Henry, Edward, Mary and 
Elizabeth. He never forgot the interests of the College in the 
demands of the State. He arranged its archives. He wrote a 
life of its Founder. He built new Lodgings for the Warden. 
He evaded as far as possible exactions by the Crown. He even 
secured a few pickings for the College, when the Monasteries 
fell into the Royal hands. He faced Cranmer’s Visitation of 
1541. He faced also the more alarming Visitation of 1549. 
For All Souls the changes of Edward’s reign had a special 
significance. The College escaped spoliation. Even its Library 
was spared—save for the erasure of the Pope’s name in manu- 
scripts and books. But its characteristics as a chantry were 
swept away.” One altar or Lord’s Table was left in the Chapel, 
But other altars, images and statues, ‘‘the things they call 
organs,” and all similar ‘‘ monuments of superstition and idola- 
try” had to be removed. To this day the organ has never been 
replaced. Chichele’s great reredos was ruthlessly destroyed. 
Papistical services were abolished, and all ‘‘ shaven rotundities 
of head.’ Noisy and needless bell-ringing was forbidden, ‘like 
the voices of people quarrelling or insane.” % In the College 
discipline and study were insisted on. The larger proposals 
contemplated, for exchanging students with New College and 
‘for making All Souls a society of jurists only, were dropped. 
But salaries were set apart for a Reader in Civil Law and for 
another in logic and natural philosophy. No money was to be 
spent on teaching Latin grammar,‘ though conversation in 
Latin, Greek or Hebrew was enjoined. All students were to be 
free to attend theological lectures, but such lectures were to be 
devoted to the Bible only. All young men were to learn the 
catechism which the authorities approved. Fellowships were 
generally limited to twenty years, and one was reserved for an

Bliss, I, ror), Munk (Royal College of Physicians, I, 58) and Grant Robert- 
son (51) give the date as 1535 or 1536. Warner was appointed Reader 
in Medicine first and Regius Professor later. 
2 Yet Prayers for the Dead, forbidden by Parliament, were not re- 
moved from the College Statutes till 1857 (Grant Robertson, 54). 
8 Prof. Burrows (Worthies, 71) doubts if the College ever had more 
than one bell. In that case the verbiage of the Visitors is absurd. 
“Clause 8 (Stats. 86). Wood tells us that Greek and Latin lectures 
had been established at All Souls by the Royal Visitors of 1535. This 
may account for the protest against the teaching of “grammar ” out of 
College funds. 
5 Mr. Grant Robertson thinks (60) that the Ordinances established a 
Professorship in Theology. They do not seem to me to go so far as that. 
At any rate they do not devote any salary to the purpose. But they 
certainly contemplate theological lectures (see Clauses 1 to 4, Stats. 85-6).

Mary’s accession swept away the ideas of the Reformers. Warner 
found his position untenable and wisely withdrew without losing 
his preferments. Two nominees of Cardinal Pole followed in 
quick succession—one of whom, Seth Holland, died in the 
Marshalsea in 1560. But he had already resigned, and his 
successor had died too. At the end of 1558 Warner returned 
for seven years more, to help in the “mild and gentle, not 
rigorous, reformation ’’ which suited the wishes of the new 
Queen. But all members of the College were not as fortunate 
as their chief. One, named Gold, had been hanged at Tyburn as 
an accomplice of the Nun of Kent. Another, a pupil of Jewel’s, 
was whipped in 1554 by the Dean—one lash for every verse he 
had written against the Mass. Others, it seems, when the storm 
burst on them, dissembled or fled. Two were expelled for 
refusing allegiance to Elizabeth. One, and probably not one 
only, became a Jesuit. Sharp and repeated pressure was needed 
to compel the College to allow its ‘‘ superstitious ’’ College plate 
to be defaced, to part with vestments, mass-books, crosses and 
other ‘‘ idolatrous monuments ”’ of the past. Warner’s successor, 
Richard Barber, who clung to the old ways, was brought up to 
London by Archbishop Parker, and the refractory Fellows were 
at last compelled to submit. But in 1571 Barber apparently 
gave up the struggle, and Robert Hovenden,? a young and 
vigorous ruler, entered on his eventful reign of over forty years. 
Hovenden is one of the most interesting figures in the College 
history, He cared for its buildings, its archives, its accounts. 
He insisted on obedience to its Statutes. He instituted a 
Punishment Book. About the beginning of the seventeenth 
century there are some curious little entries. Mr. Butcher, 
found by the Proctors ‘“‘ somewhat distempered with drink,’ is 
required to take his meals in Hall. Sir Gentilis is deprived of 
two days’ commons for not attending prayers. Sir Denne has 
to write a commentary on the Fourth Book of the Institutions 
for his ‘‘ excess in battling,” and is ordered to forbear the company 
of undergraduates to prevent more serious faults.? In trying to

(Clause 12).

College Register and other documents have Hoveden also.

make one medical Fellow take Orders, Hovenden came into 
conflict with Elizabeth herself. He had to face pressure from 
greedy courtiers and troublesome requests from the Queen. 
There was a long struggle with the Cromwell family over some 
of the College lands. There was a far too favourable lease 
granted to Sir Walter Ralegh or his friends. There was an 
insolent claim for a similar lease from Lady Stafford, supported 
by very strong influence at Court. A bribe was offered to the 
Warden, and even Whitgift advised compliance. But “ the 
poore and leane schollers’” rebuked the great lady for her 
“stomake,’ and the courageous Warden carried the day. The 
Queen was at last induced to restore the parsonage of Stanton 
Harcourt, dear to the Fellows as a place of refuge when Oxford 
suffered from visitations of the plague. Hovenden left the 
College full.2. His memorial by the door of the Ante-Chapel 
does justice to his long and valuable service, to ‘the 
sagacity and prudence” he exhibited ‘‘for three and forty 
years.” 
Warden Moket, who succeeded in 1614, unwisely wrote a 
book upon Church policy which omitted all reference to the 
authority of the Church. The High Churchmen seized the 
opportunity to humiliate not only Moket but his patron, Arch- 
bishop Abbot, whom they had little cause to love. The book 
was burned in public and the title of ‘‘ the roasted Warden” 
clung to its unhappy author till his death. Warden Astley, 
also a Chaplain of Abbot’s, carried the College through many 
prosperous years. The golden age of large surpluses had begun. 
But it was an age of increasing luxury and tippling. Beer- 
houses abounded. In 1629 the College cellar had to be enlarged. 
We hear of misconduct, of small peculations, of refractory Fellows, 
of disrespect for Wardens. In 1631 there was an outrage. 
Wild spirits took “ the intolerable liberty ” to tear off the College 
doors and gates. The Visitor was scandalised. ‘‘ Civil men,” 
he said, ‘“ should never so far forget themselves, under pretence 
of a foolish Mallard, as to do things barbarously unbecoming.” 
Meanwhile Royal interference with the College patronage in- 
creased, The Stuarts had no more distaste for jobs than Queen 
Elizabeth. Archbishop Bancroft was as ready to approve them 
as his master. Even Abbot was not proof against the habit 
of the times. 
Cranmer was by no means the only Primate who laboured 
to reform the College. Parker watched over it closely. He

lamented its ecclesiastical vagaries.1 He deplored its quarrels. 
He encouraged its zeal for learning. He tried to protect its 
elections from abuse. Grindal would not allow the Fellows to 
be turned into London lawyers. They must not live away from 
Oxford to study the Common Law. But he sanctioned the 
increase of the weekly commons to two shillings and eightpence 
for Masters, to two and twopence for the other Fellows,? 
Whitgift, whose fine prayers of Commemoration and Thanks- 
giving are still recited in the Chapel, was more indulgent than 
Grindal to the students of law. He released them from the 
obligation to take Orders. But they must practise in Oxford, 
and must forfeit their Fellowships if interest or employment 
drew them elsewhere. Whitgift did his best to put down corrup- 
tion in elections. He insisted on the Fellows dining in Hall. 
He denounced the “ persplendid and sumptuous banquets” in 
their chambers, and the large number of boys and servants they 
maintained. And his Visitation, begun in 1601, was followed by 
a long series of Injunctions, which both strengthened and en- 
larged the Statutes. He regulated afresh the Chapel services, 
the Fellows’ discipline and dress. He recalled the old rules for 
disputation and study, the need of residence, the restraint upon 
“un-honest ’’ games. He recommended better checks upon 
expenditure and better care of the College records. He estab- 
lished a register of College “ acts.’’ He rebuked unpunctuality 
in paying battels. He warned the Fellows against luxurious 
living, against unnecessary servants, unnecessary horses, and 
the temptations of the College double ale. 
Archbishop Bancroft suspended the Injunction which forbade 
the Fellows to practise as Civilians outside the University. 
And he allowed ‘‘a competent augmentation of diet” to be

1566-7. 
2 Whitgift confirmed this (Stats. 90). See also his Register at Lambeth 
(I, ff. 125» and 126). 
3 Prof. Burrows says (Worthies, 108) that Whitgift confirmed in the 
most positive manner the Warden’s old right of veto on the election of 
College officers. I have not been able to trace this, but the Archbishop’s 
Register at Lambeth shows (I, f. 200) that he did not hesitate to intervene 
in College elections. In 1680 the Warden’s claim to veto the eléction of 
Fellows became a fiercely contested point in the struggle against corrupt 
elections. The Statutes (Cap. 2), no doubt, gave him a certain power 
of supervising and stopping elections: and it may be, as Mr. Grant 
Robertson suggests (43), that, in return for waiving his right of veto and 
allowing Fellows to nominate their successors, for a consideration, he 
had been tacitly allowed to nominate when Fellowships were vacated by 
death. The Warden’s prerogatives are fully discussed in Chap, V of the 
Wenman MSS.

  374 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
made out of the surplus income of the College. This surplus 
was becoming almost an embarrassment. It was growing too 
large to be stored in the Tower. The College had more money 
than it could reasonably spend on food, and augmentation of 
diet was made a pretext for extravagant feasting.1 Bancroft, 
however, would not allow the surplus to be divided between the 
Fellows, and he would not sanction the Bursars’ slovenly way 
of keeping their accounts. Abbot tried in vain to save the 
surplus for the College Treasury, and to use it for buying 
advowsons and books. But he had to yield apparently to the 
pressure of the Fellows, and not only to increase the allowances 
for livery, but to permit the division of considerable sums.? 
No wonder that the competition for Fellowships, as the Arch- 
bishop noted, steadily increased. Abbot struggled harder against 
corrupt resignations. He insisted that every Fellow resigning 
should solemnly take “his corporal oath” that he had not 
received and would not receive ‘‘ any money or moneyworth.” 
But there is little ground for thinking that the corporal oath 
put the mischief down. Laud dealt perhaps more wisely with 
the surplus. He required a certain sum to be reserved for College 
purposes, but allowed the rest to be divided by the Fellows. 
Sheldon sanctioned a compromise which had become inevitable. 
Sancroft, spurred on by Warden Jeames, returned to the charge 
against corrupt resignations. He recalled Abbot’s oath against 
“simoniacal pravity and practice.’ He denounced the Fellows 
who made a mock of sin. The Visitors never ceased to enjoin 
good conduct and to reprove offences. Jobs and corruption, 
luxury and waste, “noctivagation,” brawling, drinking, “ in- 
decent ’’ hair and dress, were easily rebuked. But the stress 
of circumstance and the infirmities of human nature did not 
always allow these admonitions to be implicitly observed. 
Laud like other Primates had his difficulties with the College, 
but the era of his influence in Oxford was at All Souls an era of 
success. The Archbishop was as zealous in pointing out irregu- 
larities in hair and boots and clothing as in reforming the services 
of the Chapel. The Communion Table was moved from the 
middle of the chancel to the upper end. There was talk of an 
1 The Statute of 1576 (18 Elizabeth, cap. 16, misquoted as 16 Eliz. 
by Bancroft in his Injunction of May 1609) had complicated matters by 
providing that in all future leases one-third at least of the old rent must 
be paid for the relief of College commons and diet. (See Shadwell, 
Enactments in Parliament, 190-1.) 
2 Compare Chichele’s and Whitgift’s regulations as to livery (Statutes, 
42 and 97). The allowances for livery became the basis on which the 
surplus was divided. Whitgift had apparently allowed the commutation 
of the livery for a money payment, which even Cranmer had found it 
difficult to prevent. (See Martin, Archives, 306-7 and 303.)

organ and a choir. Sheldon, who became Warden in 1635, was 
an able ruler and a famous Churchman, “ born and bred to be 
Archbishop of Canterbury,” and destined in due course to come 
into his own. But Sheldon was no mere stickler for forms. 
His advice to young gentlemen, his chaplain tells us, was always 
to be honest. ‘‘ Do well and rejoice”’ was his motto. A good 
life mattered more than any Church.!. With Laud, the Warden 
faced the rising storm. In July 1642 the College sent its ready 
money to the King.? Next year its plate followed—basons, 
flagons, goblets, ‘salts,’ and even Warden Keyes’ great gilt 
cup with the figure of St. Michael on it. The College rents from 
lands in the possession of the Parliament failed. There could 
be no doubt on which side Sheldon and his colleagues stood. 
In 1643 the College undertook—it probably had no option— 
to maintain a hundred and twenty soldiers for the King at 
four shillings weekly a head.* Its most ardent Royalists were 
soon fighting ‘contra xvxdoxépadac”’: Roundhead perhaps 
sounded more detestable when converted into Greek.t In 1644 
the want of money compelled Warden and Fellows to make its 
members “‘ co-ex-co,”’ that is apparently to give them leave of 
absence and commons together. In 1645 twenty-five shillings 
a week for five weeks had to be paid towards the Bulwarks. 
In September 1646 it was agreed to have only one meal a day.® 
The Register shows that admissions dropped to one in 1643, to 
none at all in 1645. In the Parliamentary Visitation which 
followed the surrender of Oxford, Sheldon, one of the represen- 
tative Royalists in the University, was expelled from his post. 
Arrested for contumacy, he was sent under guard to a place of 
detention, “ followed by a great company of scholars and blessed 
by the people as he passed the streets.” Palmer of Queen’s, 
“a great rumper,”’ but a man of distinction and of moderate 
opinions, was appointed Warden—the College called him ‘‘ Pseudo- 
Custos ’’—in his stead. All Souls was purged. A few Fellows 
submitted. But the rest showed a fine fertility of evasion, and 
many who would not clearly accept the authority of Parliament 
were removed.® “Saucy’’ servants, including an indomitable

butler, were dismissed. A large number of new Fellows were 
gradually appointed or ‘‘ intruded,” of whom Thomas Sydenham 
was not the least. In 1653 a greater than Sydenham, Christopher 
Wren, was elected with more freedom. Study, discipline and 
godly conduct became conditions of success. But party spirit 
and human frailty inevitably survived. And the practice of 
corrupt resignations proved to be too stubborn an evil for even 
the reformers of the Commonwealth to destroy. 
After the Restoration Warden Sheldon returned with the 
King.?. But he passed on soon to greater duties, and showed 
as Primate a character and courage not too common in Charles’ 
Court. Charles himself, and James and Pepys and Clarendon 
paid visits to the College. Warden Jeames, elected in 1665,° 
a stout-hearted Royalist who had served in the war, found that 
he needed more than Hovenden’s firmness to battle with the 
courtiers of the day. Jobs in high quarters were now a part 
of the prerogative. Even Sheldon, as Visitor, though he stipu- 
lated for the election of the best men, was anxious for the King 
to be “ gratified”? too. But the Fellows were gratified in their 
turn by leave to divide the surplus income of the College, a 
privilege long claimed and now finally secured. Jeames, how- 
ever, made a firm stand against corruption, and Archbishop 
Sancroft came to his support.4 Abbot’s oath against the sale 
of Fellowships was revived, though many Fellows refused to 
take it. At the College election of 1680 the Warden determined 
“to break off those sinful and shameful customs,” and imposed 
his veto on the nominations handed in. The right to appoint 
then devolved on the Archbishop, and a hard fight with the 
refractory Fellows ensued. When “the Faction” tried legal 
proceedings, Jeames made them suffer by charging the College 
surplus with the costs. Sancroft stood by him. Even Charles’ 
judges decided for reform. The evil of corrupt resignations 
was defeated, and submission was cheaply purchased by cer- 
tain small payments and allowances which the Fellows received 
instead. But the mischiefs of the time were not exorcised. 
as 22 and the number of submissions as 8 (Ib. 571): but elsewhere 
(Worthies, 192) he speaks of 5 Submitters and 13 Nonsubmitters—figures 
which Mr. Grant Robertson (125) adopts. I doubt if the figures can be 
given exactly. 
1 Cromwell, as Chancellor, restored freedom of election. But a story 
told by Warden Jeames later, which Wren did not confirm, attributed 
Wren’s election largely to Warden Palmer (Burrows, Worthies, 206-8). 
2 Palmer died in March 1660. It seems that only five of the old 
Fellows were replaced on the Restoration (Grant Robertson, 135 and 138). 
2 Warden Meredith ruled from 1661 to 1665, and restored the Chapel 
with more liberality than wisdom. 
4 The chief credit and the bolder spirit lay, I think, with Jeames.
-P-A-G-E-432
  
THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 377 
Hard drinking, not always separable from political enthusiasm, 
played havoc with the reputation of the Fellows. In 1682 we 
find them frightening the landlady of the Mitre into fits—she 
“died at three in the morne ’’—and drinking midnight healths 
to the Duke of York and Lord Abingdon out of the buckets 
that hung in the Hall. Jeames’ successor, Leopold Finch, was 
a rollicking Royalist, nominated by James II: Dryden was 
rumoured to have had some chance of the post. Under Finch, 
of whom his predecessor had once written that “ the very tavern 
over the way was afraid of his coming to be so near a neigh- 
bour,’”’ + the College life inevitably reflected the license of the 
age. Awkward questions arose over elections: Court patronage 
counted more than merit. The claims of Founder’s kin were 
revived and seriously affected the College fortunes.? All Souls 
became more and more a society of gentlemen of comfortable 
means, if not, as Hearne characteristically added, ‘‘ of no morals 
and less learning.” Yet science and music flourished there. 
Even Finch dabbled in the classics. He was not, says Wood 
—tepid praise for the Head of a College—‘ altogether a de- 
bauchee.” A fit product of Restoration politics, he went over 
to King William in the nick of time. He died, tradition says, 
with the bailiffs in his house: the Visitor had already been 
compelled to cut down his allowance for battels. His monu- 
ment speaks of him as “Custos dilectissimus.” It is not in 
Oxford only that men’s failings make them loved. 
Many notable names, besides those of Wardens, dignify the 
College lists. Robert Recorde, a Fellow in 1531, was one of 
the greatest of early mathematicians, the first probably to in- 
troduce algebra into England and to adopt the Copernican 
system. David Pole, the most generous of all early benefac- 
tors to the Library, and a Bishop deprived by Elizabeth, was. 
probably a kinsman of the Cardinal who tried so vainly to undo 
the Reformation. Petre, Mason and Weston‘ were Tudor states- 
men of repute. William Aubrey, Professor and Civilian in the 
days of Elizabeth, ‘‘a man of exquisite erudition,’ was one of 
several eminent lawyers, Doctors and divines. John Proctor, 
the first Master of Tonbridge School, which its Founder, a kins- 
man of Archbishop Chichele, intended to connect with the College,

election as Warden, in Gutch’s Collectanea Curiosa (II, 49-53).

dedicated tracts to Queen Mary and furnished materials for the 
history of her reign. Sir Daniel Dunn was the first represen- 
tative sent by the University to Parliament. Sir Anthony 
Sherley, a daring and typical adventurer, served with Sidney, 
with Essex and with Henry of Navarre, carried his strange 
schemes to the Court of Persia, turned plotter, renegade and 
admiral of Spain. Robert Gentilis, son of the great Civilian, 
“infant prodigy, scapegrace and translator,” secured his Fellow- 
ship by Court favour,1 but won fame in Oxford only as a king 
of beggars. Charles Cesar, son of the well-known Master of 
the Rolls, who bought his father’s office later at a price which 
shows what its profits must have been, also owed his Fellowship 
to Royal favour, but he owed his credit as a Civilian to his own 
deserts. Sir Arthur Duck, another successful lawyer, wrote 
Chichele’s biography and proved a devoted son of the College. 
Jeremy Taylor, a Cambridge man put in by Laud, atoned by 
an illustrious career for his improper nomination. Brian Duppa, 
thrice a Bishop, was Charles I’s friend and Charles II’s tutor, 
a great figure in Oxford and a great pillar of the Church. Peter 
Pett was one of the first Fellows of the Royal Society, but was 
expelled for ‘‘ not performing his obligation ” to it.2 Sir Richard 
Napier made a great noise in the world, as a “ pretender to 
virtu and astrology,” but he had not the advantage of familiar 
communication with the angel Raphael which his uncle and 
namesake, a more celebrated astrologer, enjoyed. Millington, 
President of the College of Physicians, was alleged to have dis- 
covered sexuality in plants. Sydenham, a far greater contri- 
butor to science, and the most original medical genius of his 
age, had fought in youth on the side of the Parliament ; and 
that may be the reason why he never belonged to the Royal 
Society in later years. 
The age of the Restoration is also the age of Christopher 
Wren. Wren’s Fellowship at All Souls dates, like Sydenham’s, 
from the years of the Commonwealth. But he became Savilian 
Professor of Astronomy in 1661. ‘‘ As a boy a prodigy, as a 
man a miracle,” he was already recognised as a scientific genius. 
Within two years he was drawing plans for the Sheldonian 
Theatre, and starting on the long series of architectural triumphs 
which yet represented one side only of an extraordinary mind. 
He left his drawings to the College and his famous dial on its

Robertson (131) suggests. That was his father’s cousin (D.N.B.).

walls. Of lesser men, Sir John Birkenhead, Reader in Moral 
Philosophy and ardent Royalist, journalist and wit, was driven 
to live in the days of usurpation by helping young gentlemen 
to write love poems. Henry Birkhead, a Romanist pervert re- 
claimed by Laud and the Founder of the Oxford Chair of Poetry, 
may perhaps be named beside him, with Thomas Creech, trans- 
lator of Lucretius, a forgotten poet, and John Norris, an English 
follower of Malebranche and an ally of the Cambridge Plato- 
nists, equally forgotten as a philosopher to-day. Matthew Tindal 
lives as a noisy controversialist who loved ‘‘ to make the clergy 
mad.” Sir William Turnbull was a Secretary of State to King 
William: Pepys thought him a fool, but Dryden and Pope con- 
sulted him as a friend. Godolphin became Dean of St. Paul’s 
and hampered Wren in his great projects. Tanner began the 
antiquarian researches which brought him a Bishopric and a 
lasting reputation. George Clarke, a useful public servant and 
a man of taste and moderation, long represented the University 
in Parliament ; but it was in the eighteenth century that his 
chief service to the College was done. And among many sons 
distinguished in their generation none better deserves to be re- 
membered by All Souls than Christopher Codrington, the “ great 
amasser of books,’’ elected a Fellow in 1690, whose noble legacy 
was soon to found the Library which bears his name. 
All Souls lawyers found distinction outside Oxford. But they 
found rewards in Oxford too. Between the days of Henry VIII 
and those of Charles I they supplied a long line of Principals to 
New Inn Hall. The College supplied also several early Heads 
for Jesus College. It has been accused, probably without jus- 
tice, of submitting itself too freely to the influence of Welshmen. 
All Souls charities are worth recording. The poor of the city 
profited by them. So did occasional foreigners—an Italian 
convert, a French Abbot, an Armenian priest. So, before the 
days of Independence, did the Colonial Colleges later. The Col- 
lege Punishment Book took note of the Fellows’ offences, and 
of the penalties and discipline enjoined. The College banquets 
received a still larger share of notice. But the Mallard was 
the peculiar invention, the special glory and folly of All Souls.

Library were acquired after the seventeenth century, and I reserve any 
details on that subject till later.

Chorus. 
O by the blood of King Edward, 
O by the blood of King Edward, 
It was a swapping, swapping Mallard |’ 
The first mention of this “‘ foolish Mallard” is in a letter from 
Archbishop Abbot.? In the seventeenth century the ceremony 
was in full swing. In the eighteenth century it attained its 
climax. On the 14th January, in the middle of the night, a 
Lord Mallard and his officers elected for the purpose went round 
the College with torches after supper, noisily hunting for the 
mythical bird, and their thundering chorus woke the sleepers 
round for half a mile. So well established then was this vener- 
able orgy, that one of the Fellows, criticising Tindal, found the 
first marks of infidelity in his disrespectful attitude towards the 
Mallard, and even Heber was seriously of opinion that “ these 
remnants of Gothicism tend very much to keep us in a sound 
consistent track.” 
Chichele spent freely on the buildings of his College,* most 
freely on the Chapel which was its special pride. The first 
quadrangle, fronting on the High Street, was on a simple scale. 
The tower contained the gateway, with rooms over it for the 
Warden, the muniments and the treasures of the College.4 The 
Library was on the East side of the quadrangle, on the first 
floor. The Chapel lay on the North side. Chambers for the 
Fellows occupied the rest: the small windows of the studies

Other versions are a little different. (See Wood’s Life, III, 512-13, and 
The Swopping Song of the Mallardians printed in 1752, etc.) Prof. Bur- 
rows (Worthies) has an Appendix on the subject. The mysterious bird 
was sought for originally perhaps in the sink or drains, where a buried 
Mallard was supposed to have been discovered by workmen in the early 
days of the College. Prof. Burrows thinks (436) the custom may have 
arisen from the finding of a thirteenth-century seal, bearing the name of 
William Malard, clerk, and the device of a peculiar four-legged griffin, 
when a drain was being dug near the Warden’s Lodgings, probably in 
Elizabethan times. a

and other necessary articles,” and {1,000 paid to the King for lands—a 
very large sum altogether (Grant Robertson, 12). 
« There are conflicting statements about the Warden’s Lodgings. As 
I understand, he occupied first the room over the gateway and the fine 
room adjoining it on the East side. Before long, if not from the first, 
he occupied the whole South-east corner of the quadrangle; and from 
there his quarters extended into the new rooms built by Warner, fronting 
on the High Street further East. Finally, early in the eighteenth century, 
the Warden’s House was built to the East of that.

remain. The old Hall began in the North-east corner and ran 
Northwards at right-angles to the Chapel, beyond the quad- 
rangle. Further North again across a small court lay the 
Cloisters, with their West side on Cat Street 1; and there the 
bones of the earliest Fellows rest. East of the buildings was 
waste land or garden ground, into which the buttery and kitchen 
extended. The Chapel was the crown of the Archbishop’s work. 
Built by a generous hand and decorated with rare magnificence, 
it has survived the worst that restorers or iconoclasts could do. 
Its hammer-beam roof, its carving, colouring and gilding, the 
fine glass in its windows—some of which in the Ante-Chapel 
still remains *—its screen showing the arms of Chichele and of 
Oxford, its organ, the first perhaps set up in any College Chapel,? 
its high altar with the Crucifixion overhead,* and above all the 
great stone reredos, filled with figures of heroes, of Fathers and 
of Saints,’ made it a noble example of fifteenth-century taste. 
The reredos, a singularly beautiful piece of sculpture, surmounted 
by a representation of the Last Judgment, and bearing the 
legend Surgite, mortui, venite ad judicium, blazed with colour 
in the Founder’s day. The favours granted by Archbishop 
Stafford and the relics gradually collected made the Chapel a 
popular resort. The nuns of Syon, among other eminent wor- 
shippers, sought ‘‘ to become partakers of its prayers.” 
But chantries like Chichele’s had short shrift in the Refor- 
mation. Its altars, its glass, its images were destroyed. The 
seventeenth century began the work of restoration, Warden 
Meredith, Sheldon’s successor, giving the lead. But Meredith, 
though a man of ‘ancient manners,” had little feeling for the 
ancient beauty of the place. The reredos was flattened and 
covered with plaster. A fresco of the Last Judgment by Streater, 
Charles IT’s Court painter—‘‘ too full of nakeds,” thought Evelyn, 
1See the ‘‘ Typus Collegii’’ of Hovenden’s day, reproduced as the 
frontispiece of Mr. Grant Robertson’s volume. 
2 The most interesting window, with portraits of Chichele and others, 
originally belonged, Prof. Oman thinks, to the old Library (Colls. of 
Oxf. 212). See also Mr. Grinling’s paper (Oxf. Architect. Soc. N.S., IV, 
III sq.). 
* The organist of All Souls sinned and was punished in 1458 (Mun. 
Acad. 674), and we hear of an organ at New College about the same date. 
The Magdalen “‘ organs ”—the plural is generally used—appear first in 
the College computi of 1481. (See Burrows, Worthies, 69-70, Bloxam’s 
Register of St. Mary Magdalen College, II, xcvi sq., and Rimbault’s History 
of the Organ, 43-4.) 
«There were other altars in the Chapel (Collect. Curiosa, II, 266). 
* This is conjecture. But we know of two great stone images, possibly 
statues of Chichele and Henry VI, and we know that four Latin Fathers, 
Jerome, Ambrose, Augustine and Gregory, had a special connection with 
the College.

  382 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
“for a chapel’”’—was painted on the top. The fine roof was 
hidden by a stucco ceiling, and Streater, whom some of his con- 
temporaries preferred to Michael Angelo, may have had a share 
in that as well.1_ The windows of the inner Chapel were re- 
modelled. Wren drew a design for a new screen, but the College 
preferred other advisers: and while Wren was still living, even 
Streater’s fresco disappeared. The eighteenth century intro- 
duced its own improvements, and their removal belongs to the 
history of a later time. But Chichele’s reredos was destined 
long afterwards to be uncovered and rebuilt, and to be filled 
afresh with figures which recall, if not the glowing colours, still 
something of the richness and the splendour of the early days. 
In the middle of the sixteenth century the College buildings 
began to spread towards the East. Warner’s new Lodgings 
for the Warden continued the High Street front. His dining- 
room was reckoned among the finest of contemporary apart- 
ments. Hovenden improved these Lodgings, and laid out a 
garden for the Warden on the site of the old Rose Inn. He 
made the old Library in the quadrangle, with its barrel roof, 
its panelling and its escutcheons, into one of the most beautiful 
rooms in Oxford.2. He had “ the cloistered green’’ converted 
into a garden with arbours. He prepared a remarkable set of 
maps of the College property, worked out in elaborate detail. 
A little later the College gates were repaired, and the statues 
over them gilded and polished. The figure of our Saviour over 
the gateway, it was said, perhaps maliciously, became a mark 
for Puritan troopers in the Civil War. But a leading Puritan 
in the city intervened to save the College sculptures from des- 
truction. Later in the seventeenth century a Common Room 
was made for the Fellows. Later still, in the eighteenth century 
great projects of extension were adopted. The building of the 
new Library for Codrington’s bequest made it necessary to 
sweep away the cloisters, to create a new quadrangle, a new 
gateway and piazza, and new towers, unique in Oxford, yet 
now inseparable from her dreaming spires. But when the Stuarts 
ceased to rule in England, All Souls was still a Gothic building, 
redolent of fifteenth-century traditions and linked by many old 
associations with the past. 
1 But Sir J. Thornhill ‘‘ adorned ” it in the eighteenth century, when 
he replaced Streater’s fresco (Grant Robertson, 170). Mr. Vallance (Old 
Colleges, 46-7) has some interesting notes on All Souls. 
2 The Fellows of All Souls inherit from Warner’s and Hovenden’s 
days two of the finest rooms in the College. 
* There seems to be fair evidence that the Puritans shot at something. 
But Professor Grant Robertson tells me that he knows of no adequate 
evidence to prove that the figure of Our Lord stood at any time on the 
High Street front.

THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 383 
It is not at first sight easy to explain why All Souls failed 
to develope Commoners, and took a form so different from 
lother Colleges in the end. Students of three years’ standing 
in Oxford? were from the beginning eligible for election as 
Fellows, and besides them there were for a long while only 
Chaplains, clerks, choristers and servants. Hovenden mentions 
a plan of Archbishop Parker’s to appoint scholars from Canter- 
bury School to take the choristers’ places.2 But the plan came 
to nothing, and there may at that time have been some point 
in Lady Stafford’s taunt that the Fellows of All Souls seemed 
rather ‘“‘ monkes in a rich abbey than students in a poore Col- 
lege.’’ It seems, however, that in the reign of Elizabeth a new 
class of students below the degree of Probationers came into 
existence. There are said to have been thirty-one Servientes in 
1612.8 Of Commoners and Fellow-Commoners in the usual 
sense we hear nothing, though they were by that time very well 
known elsewhere. How long these poor students continued at 
All Souls is uncertain, but before the end of the seventeenth 
century they had apparently disappeared*; and with their dis- 
appearance ended any prospect of making the College a place 
of education for young men. 
The failure of All Souls to develop a body of undergraduate 
students is not fully accounted for by some of the reasons that 
have been suggested for it. It is not exact to say that Chichele 
fixed no property-limit for his Fellows, or that his foundation 
was a graduate community from the first. Other Colleges, 
University and Oriel for instance, were more strictly designed 
for graduate members. Other Colleges also, like New College 
and Magdalen, were just as much intended to train men for ser- 
vice in Church and State. The question of Founder’s kin did 
not become important till the eighteenth century. The College 
buildings, if limited and crowded, could after all have been 
enlarged. The obligations of the Statutes, the conditions in 
regard to study and the Injunctions of the Visitors are not of 
themselves sufficient to explain the exceptional position which 
the College took. And yet, no doubt, several of these causes 
1 There was nothing to prevent their being undergraduates. 
2 See Burrows (Worthies, 116) and Grant Robertson (80-1). 
® Whitgift seems to use the term sevvientes rather loosely in his Injunc- 
tions. But they were poor students rather than servitors. In one place 
(Statutes, 105) he associates them with the socii and scholares, as persons 
who might conceivably maintain pueri or famuli in the College. 
4 Even by 1660, perhaps (see Grant Robertson, 81), Langbaine puts 
the numbers of the College at seventy about 1651. 
5 Prof. Grant Robertson has some interesting pages on this subject 
(27-30). But some of the reasons there suggested do not seem to me 
conclusive.

——————————— Te 
384 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
did contribute to that result, and All Souls did in fact become 
chiefly a Society of Doctors and Masters, composed of men 
educated at other Colleges in Oxford, and preoccupied with 
their own studies and careers. The large legal element in the 
College, looking to the outside world for professional advance- 
ment, gave it a peculiar character, which to some extent New 
College shared. Above all, the division of the surplus income 
among the Fellows, and the practice of selling their. places, to 
which they so obstinately clung, must have had a powerful 
influence in keeping up a close corporation, and in rendering 
the Fellows disinclined for changes which might involve new 
charges on the College funds. There probably was a time, be- 
tween the accession of Queen Elizabeth and the Great Rebellion, 
when All Souls came near to developing Commoners, as other 
Colleges had done. But the opportunity was allowed to pass. 
The age of the Restoration, when the poor students disappeared, 
was not an age for liberal reforms, and no very strong reason 
was then needed to explain why a small and privileged Society 
with Conservative traditions should hesitate to take an impor- 
tant new departure. To some Oxonians of the seventeenth | 
century it may well have seemed a stranger thing that New 
College should open its doors to Commoners than that All Souls 
should not. In the age which followed, the claims of Founder’s 
kin, the practice of non-residence, and the want of educational 
activity in the College, all tended to stereotype the old and 
narrow view. When the College buildings were enlarged in the 
eighteenth century, and the College regulations freely altered 
by the Visitors, no suggestion apparently to encourage the 
growth of Commoners was made. The College had definitely 
taken its line, and any idea of expansion had vanished. All 
Souls became more and more a close society, reserved for the 
well-born and the well-to-do, proud of its distinctive character 
in Oxford, indifferent to University teaching and traditions, and 
linked firmly with the world outside it in which its most suc- 
cessful Fellows moved. Its reputation as a place of study 
diminished, but its reputation as a place of fashion increased. 
“Your Smarts, your gallant gentlemen,” lived in its quad- 
rangles. ‘‘ You would think them,” says a lively critic, “all 
bodies and no souls.” 4 
1 There are ample materials for the College history, which have been 
effectively used by Prof. Montagu Burrows in his Worthies of All Souls, 
by Prof. Oman in the Colleges of Oxford, and by Prof. Grant Robertson 
in his volume on Ail Souls College. I am greatly indebted to all three. 
Mr. C. T. Martin has printed a valuable Catalogue of the College Archives 
—charters, deeds, letters, accounts, and miscellaneous papers illustrating 
the whole history of the College. Gutch, who was Chaplain of All Souls, 
added useful notes to Wood’s sketch (Colleges, 252-305), and his Collec-

     THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 385 
William of Wykeham’s example had inspired Chichele’s 
foundation. Another great ecclesiastic, closely connected with 
Winchester, if not with New College also,1 founded, before the 
fifteenth century was over, a College destined in loveliness to 
surpass them all. William Patten took the name of Waynflete 
from the little town on the Lincolnshire coast where he was 
born. His father, whose monument is now in the Chapel at 
Magdalen, was apparently a man of some standing.? It seems 
that the future Bishop was educated at Oxford, was appointed 
in 1429 Master of Wykeham’s famous school at Winchester, 
and became also Master of a Hospital dedicated to St. Mary 
Magdalen there. From Winchester Henry VI drew him to take 
charge of his new College at Eton. The lilies of Eton have 
their counterpart in the lilies of Magdalen yet. A successful 
scholar, schoolmaster, administrator, Waynflete completely won 
the confidence of Henry. On the death of Cardinal Beaufort 
in 1447, he was recommended for the Cardinal’s See. He grew 
into a powerful Minister and courtier. In 1456 he was Lord 
Chancellor. In the dark years that followed he was the chief 
support of the unhappy King. He had the wisdom to be recon- 
ciled with Edward IV. He offered civilities to Richard of 
Gloucester. He welcomed, perhaps with a more whole-hearted 
courtesy, the accession of a Tudor Prince. But Waynflete’s 
love of education was probably the chief interest of his life. 
As wealth and opportunity came to him, he set himself to en- 
courage learning. From the time of his appointment as Bishop 
of Winchester, the design of founding a College at Oxford seems 
never to have been absent from his mind. He lived long enough 
tanea Curiosa contains some interesting details. Mr. Grant Robertson 
has drawn both on the-Wenman MSS. in the Warden’s keeping and on 
the Tannery MSS. in the Bodleian. I have to thank the Warden’s kindness 
for leave to consult not only the seven vols. of Wenman MSS. with their 
miscellaneous notes—Wenman was an eighteenth-century Professor—the 
Punishment Book, dating from 1601, and the Register kept at his house, 
but also some of the original charters and documents in the College 
Archives—one of which is a letter addressed to King John—some of the 
fifteenth and sixteenth century Bursars’ Books and Computi, the College 
Register, with its lists of Fellows and its notes and entries, becoming 
important in Hovenden’s day, and the Acia in Capitulis—minutes of 
College orders and events—the first volume of which runs from 1602 to 
1707. This minute book contains some of the most interesting entries. 
Hovenden kept some earlier minutes before this book began. 
1 Waynflete’s education at Winchester and New College is not fully 
established. But his attachment to New College was close. He speaks 
(Statutes, Magdalen, 7) of “ nostri Collegii beatee Marie Virginis Wyntonie 
in Oxonia,”’ but that may be only in his capacity as Bishop. (See Budden’s 
Latin Life of Waynflete, 13 sq., Chaundler’s Life, 5~7, and Kirby’s Win- 
chester Scholars, and Annals of Winchester College, 198.)

though the evidence is not strong.

to give his dreams a noble shape. His body lies in a magnificent 
tomb at Winchester. But his words of thanksgiving, 
“Fecit mihi magna qui potens est,” 
are carved over the entrance to the Chapel of the College which 
he built. 
In 1448 Waynflete received the King’s license to found in 
Oxford a Hall for a President and fifty graduate Scholars more 
or less, to be called the Hall of the blessed Mary Magdalen, or 
in common parlance Maudaleyne Halle. For a site he secured 
among other tenements Bostar Hall? on the South side of the 
High Street, between the present Schools and Logic Lane, and 
Hare Hall which lay behind it further South. He gave his 
Society a Head and a Charter, and promised it Statutes later 
on. Twenty Scholars were appointed, to study theology and 
philosophy, all Masters or Bachelors of Arts. But before the 
new foundation had been long in existence, a larger project 
altered its history. The old Hospital of St. John the Baptist, 
which lay beyond the East gate of the town, which Henry III 
had refounded and which even Henry’s grasping father had 
endowed, had fallen upon evil days. Its brethren were reduced 
to four. Its sisters had disappeared altogether. Its rules were 
disregarded and its funds ill spent. In 1456 Waynflete secured 
a grant of its possessions. Next year he received the Royal 
license to found a new College of St. Mary Magdalen, in which 
the Hospital and Magdalen Hall were both to be absorbed.® 
In June 1458, intending, we are told, to substitute heavenly 
things for earthly, he issued a Charter for this foundation, which 
provided for existing interests and made Magdalen Hall a part 
of the new plan. In the critical days which followed, the 
Founder bought the favour of King Edward. A valuable in- 
1 Statutes of Colleges (Vol. II, Magdalen, v). ‘‘ Mawdelyn College ” is 
also mentioned (Ib. 81). The pronunciation is older than the College. 
2 Otherwise ‘‘ Borstalle.” 
3 Mr. H. A. Wilson (Magdalen College, 9-16) describes clearly the stages 
in this process. The foundation deeds of the College are given in Mr. 
Salter’s Cartulary of the Hospital of St. John the Baptist (II, 413-32), and 
the Hospital’s history is best given in the Preface to vol. III of that 
work. The same volume gives the Rule of the Hospital (1-6), a Computus 
Roll of 1340 (18-27), which shows a possible total of sixteen members 
besides the Master and servants at that date, and an Appendix on the 
Hospital architecture by Mr. R. T. Gunther, who suggests that there was 
accommodation for 10 Brothers and 8 Sisters. See also Wood (City, II, 
519-29). In the heading to the Statutes (Statutes of Colleges, I1) printed 
in 1853, the foundation is dated 1459. But the license to found the 
College is dated July 18, 1457, and Waynflete’s earliest charters to it 
are dated September 30, 1457, and June 12, 1458. The earlier founda- 
tion also, though called Magdalen Hall, was, as Dean Rashdall points out 
(II, 512, n.), essentially a College from the first.

    THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 387 
heritance from Sir John Fastolf of Caister, one of the great 
soldiers of Agincourt, whose name was destined to a slight cor- 
ruption and a rare celebrity, came in. A derelict Priory at 
Sele in Sussex with benefices near increased the College hold- 
ings.1_ While the Scholars lived in the old tenements about the 
High Street, the building of the new College beside the Cherwell 
went on. Quarries at Headington, Wheatley and elsewhere 
furnished the stone. In 1467 the enclosing walls on the South 
were begun. The ‘‘ great wall” along the Western boundary, 
now Long Wall Street,? and the “lesser wall” on the North 
boundary followed. The foundation stone of the Chapel was 
laid on the 5th May 1474.8 The Hall, the Library, the cloister 
chambers and the first towers were gradually completed. Parts 
of the old Hospital buildings were for a time allowed to remain. 
In 1480, the year when Tybard, the first President,* gave place 
to Richard Mayew, the College, it seems, took possession of its 
new home. 
Two or three years elapsed before the Founder’s Statutes 
were finished, years occupied in organising the Society and in 
getting its ordinances into shape. President Mayew had some 
trouble with members who objected to the rules laid down. 
The Pope issued a Bull confirming Waynflete’s regulations and 
attaching the College to the diocese of Winchester. The Founder 
paid more than one visit to Oxford. King Edward and King 
Richard enjoyed the College hospitality in turn. At last, in 
1483, the Statutes seem to have been completed, and gradually 
the vacancies on the foundation were filled up. Waynflete was 
steeped in Wykeham’s traditions, and Wykeham’s code served 
for an example once again. But on some points the younger 
Bishop took a line of his own. In ‘‘ Seynte Mary Magdalen 
College” there were to be finally a President, forty poor and 
indigent Scholars, clerks studying theology and philosophy, and 
thirty other poor Scholars, commonly called ‘‘ Demyes,” study- 
ing grammar, logic and sophistics.6 There were also to be four 
Chaplains, eight clerks and sixteen choristers. Magdalen, like 
New College, was to have a famous choir. Two or three of the 
1 Other suppressed religious Houses were also annexed. (See later, 
p. 391.) There are interesting old deeds relating to Sele in the College 
Archives. (See Fourth Report, Hist. MSS. Commission, 463.) 
? William Orchard or Orcheyerd was the chief mason. The day wages 
of the workmen varied from 34d. to 6d. a day (Wilson, Magdalen, 22). 
* This is the date given in the building accounts quoted by Dr. Bloxam 
(Register of St. Mary Magdalen College, 11, App. I, 227). There is an 
error in Wood’s date (Colleges, 322). 
4 John Horley was apparently Head of the earlier Hall (Wilson, 7 
and 16).

  388 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Fellows might study Civil Law or Canon Law, and two or three 
others might study medicine; but the theologians and philoso- 
phers far outnumbered the rest. The forty Fellows were, as 
usual, to be chaste and modest persons, fit for study and for 
the priestly life. They were to be, if possible, Masters or 
Bachelors in Arts, drawn specially from certain dioceses and 
counties. Failing Masters and Bachelors, undergraduates might 
be elected, and in the last resort students who had reached their 
fifteenth year. A year’s probation was required before their 
admission as full Fellows. Their commons varied with the 
price of corn from twelve to sixteen pence. But these commons 
were subject to reduction if bad times intervened, or if funds 
were needed to repair the buildings. Fellows were liable to lose 
their Fellowships if they deserted their studies, or married or 
turned monks, or if they succeeded to property or to a benefice 
of a certain value.2 The Demies were boys appointed by the 
President, Vice-President and Deans, and drawn from districts 
where the College had property. They must have reached their 
twelfth year before admission,® and might stay on, unless their 
income was excessive, till they were twenty-five. They were 
to be thoroughly grounded in grammar first, and a few of them 
might devote themselves to the humanities,‘ so as to qualify 
for teaching others. They were called “Sir”: we hear of Sir 
Browne and Sir Charnock. But for all their style they had 
only half the commons of the Fellows.’ They had only half 
the Fellows’ leave of absence also. The Founder was deter- 
mined to justify their name. 
The President of the Society was to be elected by the Fellows ® 
1 Especially from the counties of Lincolnshire and Oxfordshire, and 
from the dioceses of Winchester and Norwich. (See the list in the Statutes, 
Magdalen, 17).) The rule was often evaded. There were also to be two 
Scholars on the foundation of Thomas Ingeldew, drawn preferably from 
the dioceses of York and Durham, and one John Forman Scholar (other- 
wise Formam) drawn from Yorkshire. 
2“ Si in eodem personaliter resideat ” (Ib. 46). 
* But it seems that in 1557 Gervase Smith was admitted at the age 
of nine. (See Macray, Register of Magdalen, New Series, II, iv.) 
« “Circa grammaticalia et poemata, et alias artes humanitatis ” 
(Statutes, 16). 
* Their commons were soon afterwards fixed at 8d. a week. The ser- 
vants had about the same allowance for food (Ib. 72 and 91-2). The 
choristers, it seems, had only 4d., besides the scraps the Fellows left 
(Bloxam, Register, I, iii). On the choristers’ dress see Bloxam (Jb. iv—v). 
*The method of election was elaborate. The Fellows as a whole 
chose two persons from present or past Fellows of Magdalen or New 
College. Of these two the thirteen senior Fellows chose one, who was 
presented to the Visitor, the Bishop of Winchester, and instituted by 
him. But the Bishop had no power to veto or delay the election (Statutes, 
6-9).

from either Magdalen or New College men. He might be a 
Master of Arts or a Doctor of law, theology or medicine. He 
drew, besides his commons, twenty pounds a year. He was 
provided with two servants and a groom. He had horses and 
plate and household utensils, sufficient ‘“‘ but not too sumptu- 
ous,’ and allowances when travelling upon College business. 
He was in fact a personage of dignity and substance, conspicuous 
among College Heads, and he might hold benefices of any value. 
But he must not without special leave be absent for more than 
two months in the year. He governed the College and super- 
vised its property. But in matters of importance he was ex- 
pected to consult the Fellows. Provision for his removal if 
necessary was made. The President had the right to entertain 
strangers. Kings of England and their heirs were to be treated 
with special honour. The association of Magdalen with the 
Royalty of England dates from its earliest years. Sons of 
nobles and of worthy persons also had special privileges as 
visitors, and out of these privileged strangers the Commoners 
of the future grew.t Otherwise no strangers were permitted to 
stay in College overnight. A Vice-President, elected by the 
President and the thirteen senior Fellows, was expected to live 
in the College and to help in its administration. He drew a 
salary of twenty-six shillings and eightpence,? and the Chaplains 
and clerks drew small salaries also. Three Bursars had charge 
of the College estates, three Deans of the studies and morals 
of the Scholars. These officers too were appointed by the Presi- 
dent and thirteen seniors, and each drew a salary of thirteen 
and fourpence a year. A University Register notes that the 
Magdalen Bursars had dripping also as a -perquisite, which in 
most cases fell to the cooks. The College servants included a 
manciple, a butler, a chief cook, without dripping but with two 
assistants, two porters who acted as barbers also, and two grooms 
to look after the horses. Nothing is said about a gardener. 
Each week one of the graduate Fellows was expected to act as 
Seneschal of the Hall. 
Waynflete’s rules for behaviour in Hall, his injunctions 
against mischievous games and sports, his arrangements for 
scrutinies, for dress, for disputations, followed the general lines 
which William of Wykeham had laid down. Card-playing now 
had to be prohibited: we hear of members of the College gam-   1“ Filii nobilium et valentium personarum,” up to the number of 
twenty, were admitted at the President’s discretion to stay in the College 
—‘ad pernoctandum et ad communas ’’—at their own expense. But 
they must be in the charge of tutors—‘‘ sub tutela et regimine creditorum, 
vulgariter creancers nuncupatorum ” (Jb., 60 and 127). 
2 This was doubled in 1495 (Ib. 106).

bling away their clothes.t But chess, it seems, was no longer 
an object of alarm. There was no mention, as at New College, 
of ‘the most vile and horrible”’ sport of shaving beards. But 
Magdalen Fellows had their own temptations, the keeping of 
dogs and ferrets, hawks and song-birds, the stealing of apples, 
sheep and deer. Magdalen too had its Christmas King: as late 
as 1588 we hear of him. And entries in the College Register 
and accounts from 1481 onwards record the election of Boy 
Bishops and the acting of religious plays. Allowances for 
livery, omitted by the Founder, were soon declared to have 
been a part of his intention,’ though Waynflete had expressly 
forbidden Visitors, Presidents or Fellows to make any change 
in his Statutes. Clothes were closely regulated. Inordinate 
hair was condemned. So were the bearing of arms and the 
dangerous habit of walking out alone. Each Fellow had a 
separate bed, though boys under fifteen slept together. But 
most of the rooms contained three or four beds. The seniors 
superintended the young ones, and were told to denounce their 
excesses and defects. Careful provision for celebrating obits, 
for prayers for Kings and benefactors, was made, and allow- 
ances given to those who performed them. There were special 
regulations against improper attempts to secure Proctorial office : 
there had been trouble on this point in the early days of the 
College. There were rules for study and for taking: degrees. 
University Graces were not to be despised. There was to be 
a Master to educate the choristers, and one of the Chaplains. 
might, if qualified, undertake the duty. 
Waynflete founded no great Public School. But like Wyke- 
ham he had large ideas of education. He was the first Public 
Schoolmaster to become a Bishop, the fore-runner of a cele- 
brated race. He saw the dawn of the Renaissance. He was 
not unmindful of the needs of his age. Three Readers, drawing 
salaries and allowances from the College, were appointed to 
give lectures in Natural Philosophy, Moral Philosophy and The- 
ology.? The lectures, which might sometimes begin at six in

  THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 301 
the morning, were open not only to the College but to scholars 
outside. College education was beginning definitely to replace 
the older system in the Schools. The Readers, if not Fellows 
already, succeeded to Fellowships when vacancies occurred. A 
fund was set apart, a hundred shillings yearly, for the instruc- 
tion of Fellows and Scholars in sophistry and logic. One or 
more tutors were appointed for this purpose. And close beside 
the College a Grammar-School was founded for the free teach- 
ing of all boys who applied.1_ Its Masters and ushers soon be- 
came famous for their learning. They were nominated by the 
President and paid out of the College funds. Teaching from 
boyhood upwards was thus made available for almost every 
member of the College.2~Wykeham’s grammar-school and 
Wykeham’s tutorial system* were reproduced upon the spot. 
And a generous offer apparently of free teaching for all comers 
replaced and extended the charities of the old Hospital of St. 
John. 
The great Bishop’s endeavours to endow his College ceased 
only with his death. Suppressed ecclesiastical foundations, not 
at Sele only but at Brackley and Aynho, at Wanborough and 
Selborne, added to its wealth.‘ There were lands in Hampshire 
and Lincolnshire and several other counties, houses in Oxford, 
houses in Southwark and the Strand. The deeds which record 
them, sealed with splendid seals, are full of medieval history, 
of strange little details about the monks of Selborne and the 
family of Fastolf and the standard-bearer of Richard I. Wayn- 
flete’s will brought the College more possessions, including his 
sandals and buskins which are still preserved. Henry VII 
visited Magdalen, as his two predecessors had done before him. 
But it is a myth which connects his benefactions with the May- 
day ceremonies held upon the Tower. Henry’s son, Arthur, 
stayed there in his boyhood, and ancient tapestries in the Presi- 
dent’s Lodgings are believed to recall the marriage which was 
to have such serious consequences for the world. Other gifts 
of lands and money followed. Scholarships were founded from 
the earliest days. Ingeldew’s and Forman’s Scholars are men- 
1“ Quoscunque ad scholam grammaticalem . . . accedentes”’ (Ib. 76). 
But in practice it seems to have been restricted to members, including 
choristers, of Colleges and Halls. Dr. Bloxam insists that only ‘‘ aca- 
demical persons ”’ were intended to use it (Register, III, 3-6). Another 
grammar school, with a Master appointed by Magdalen, was founded in 
Wainfleet. 
2The Jurists shared in the teaching provided by the 100 shillings 
yearly. But nothing is said about students of medicine (Statutes, 78). 
8 * Informator ”’ is the term used for the teacher, as usual. 
4Mr. Wilson has an Appendix on the religious foundations annexed 
to the College (Magdalen, 264), and interesting details are given in the 
Fourth Report of the Hist. MSS. Commission (459).

392 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
tioned in the Statutes. Other scholarships established in the 
sixteenth century, and named after the donors, are proofs of 
the good friends which the College had acquired.1_ Magdalen, 
though founded in days of revolution, had no early struggles 
with poverty to face. 
Mayew, one of the earliest Presidents, was conspicuous in 
the Royal service. Like Wolsey afterwards, he was Almoner to 
the King. He helped to negotiate the marriage of Catharine 
of Arragon, and was made a Bishop in 1504. But he refused 
to give up his post at Magdalen. His non-residence led to 
serious troubles and complaints. And after a sharp quarrel 
the Visitor’s interference brought his tenure of the Presidency 
abruptly to an end. Claymond, with his scholarship, his wealth, 
his generous alms-deeds, proved a more successful ruler. A man 
of high character and public spirit, he was the friend of Erasmus 
and of More. He was the friend too of Bishop Fox, and in 1516 
he passed on to become the first President of Fox’s new College 
of Corpus. His successor, Higdon, passed on in the same way 
to be the first Dean of Cardinal College.2_ Magdalen contributed 
in no small degree to man the new foundations, and the great 
name of the Magdalen Cardinal overshadowed them all. Wolsey, 
a Fellow of some years’ standing, was Bursar of the College be- 
fore the fifteenth century closed. We find him travelling upon 
College business and buying cloth for a chorister’s clothes. But 
there is no ground for believing the story that he misapplied 
the College funds. In the days of his power he drew Magdalen 
men freely into his service. His influence was soon paramount 
at Oxford as elsewhere.* 
Tyndale stayed at Magdalen Hall, and his doctrines spread 
widely among members of the College. The Fellows found less 
difficulty than we might expect in accepting Henry as Head of 
the Church,‘ and in discarding ‘“‘ Duns and such like stuff.” 
1 See the benefactions of Guldford, Higdon, Morwent, Claymond, etc. 
(Statutes, 112 sq.). Money left by the last three is still distributed to the 
President, Fellows, Demies and others, as far as possible in fourpenny 
bits, on the first Monday in Lent (Warren, Magdalen College, 103). The 
choristers get new pennies. 
4 There are interesting notes on Mayew, Claymond and Higdon in the 
two great Magdalen Registers (Macray, VII, 105 sqg.; I, 35 sq., 114-15, 
and 123 sg.; and Bloxam, IV, 3 sq., xxiii, and elsewhere ; see also the 
indexes). But Mr. Wilson has missed nothing of what they contain. 
3 Wolsey’s name first appears in the College books in 1497, apparently 
as an M.A. (Bloxam, III, 25). But he may have been a member of the 
College from 1491 or 1492. Mr. Wilson (71) thinks that he made a Visi- 
tation of the College as Legate in 1527. (See also later, Chap. X.) 
«On Cranmer’s Visitation early in 1535, and on Gardiner’s first Visi- 
tation in 1532, see vol. III of the College Register (C) in the Bursar’s 
keeping (pp. 23 and 113-14).

THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 393 
They may have felt more about paying for the new lecture in 
Greek which the Royal Commissioners of 1535 established.1 
Oglethorpe, a President elected under Thomas Cromwell, held 
office, though not continuously, under King Edward and Queen 
Mary, and survived as a Bishop to crown Queen Elizabeth.? 
But even his wise and cautious administration could not escape 
the disorders of the time. ‘‘ Undecent innovations’ made their 
way to Oxford. One member of the College, who lived to be 
a Bishop, is alleged to have taken away the Sacrament and 
broken it in pieces. Another, John Stokesley, who became 
Bishop of London, had already been charged with theft, per- 
jury, adultery and witchcraft, and accused of baptizing a cat.® 
Hatchets were brought into the College Chapel. A riot broke 
against the gates. King Edward’s Council threatened the exis- 
tence of the Grammar School, and the Mayor and citizens of 
Oxford intervened in its support. The extreme Reformers 
attacked the priests and dispersed the College vestments. They 
paid the penalty when Queen Mary dispossessed Queen Jane.‘ 
Gardiner, as Visitor, ejected some of the Protestant Fellows. 
Julins Palmer, once a Fellow, was burned. Thomas Bentham, 
expelled at Gardiner’s Visitation, is said to have prayed by the 
martyrs at Smithfield. And the Protestants triumphed again 
as soon as Elizabeth succeeded. Coveney, elected President in 
1558, and strangely enough not a priest but a Bachelor of Medi- 
cine,> gave way to Laurence Humfrey, a well-known Calvinist 
divine. There was little- violent change. The College proved 
“conformable”? and accepted the new order. Even Humfrey 
after a stout resistance put the hated vestments on, and one 
hopes he had humour enough to enjoy, like his contemporaries, 
the compliments on his appearance paid him by the Queen. 
Humfrey was a man of character and reputation. His fame 
drew Commoners freely to the College, but the Fellows resented 
the confusion which they caused. In 1584 complaints were 
made not only of “‘ commoners higher and lower,” but of batte- 
lers and poor scholars without number, who paid little regard, 
1The payment is not recorded until 1540. In 1541 and 1542 pay- 
ments were made for a geography lecture—perhaps a College experiment 
(Wilson, 78, n.). 
2 Accused of “superstition,” Oglethorpe resigned in 1552, when 
Haddon, the Master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, was appointed. But 
after Mary’s accession Oglethorpe returned, till succeeded by Cole, an 
old servant of Wolsey, in 1555. 
*See Bloxam (II, xliii and III, 23). 
4 But the Vice-President’s Register, which begins in 1547, does not 
indicate that the Protestants suffered very severely, though some Fellows 
were removed and some withdrew (Wilson, 106 sq.). 
5 The Visitor thought the election irregular, but allowed it to stand. 
Coveney took orders later (Wilson, 106), and was deprived in 1561,
-P-A-G-E-451

as it seems, to College rules. Fifty years later the Visitor is 
found lamenting the ‘‘ multitude of poore schollers and Servi- 
tors, which hang upon the Colledge in an idle and unschollerly 
way.’ ? Humfrey’s reign, in spite of his abilities, was marked 
by a good deal of disorder. Party feeling flourished. Misman- 
agement and corruption crept in. Mr. President was accused 
of favouring ‘‘ atheists, ruffians, idle bellies,” and, strangest of 
all, Papists. There was selling of places in College; the elec- 
tions were compared to horse-fairs. There was “ coursing of 
dogges, singing of rounds, throwing of stones in the night.” 
Fellows who had shaved their heads in derision of the tonsure 
were sentenced to wear night-caps.? The Lord Lieutenant of 
the county, who had imprisoned a Magdalen man for poaching, 
was stoned as he passed under the tower. But the next Presi- 
dent, Nicholas Bond, inevitably nicknamed the Bond of iniquity, 
restored peace and prosperity to the College. He owed his 
election to the Queen’s interference. He had his enemies, who 
impugned his morals and accused him of dancing in company 
unfitting for a divine. But under Bond lectures and discipline 
and finance improved. Surpluses became available for the 
Fellows to divide.t The Queen’s counsellors and nobles were 
entertained at Magdalen when she visited Oxford in 1592, and 
James I came there in person. James brought Prince Henry 
with him and complimented the Fellows on possessing ‘‘ the 
most absolute building in Oxford.’ But the Prince, a gallant 
child of eleven, stayed among them, and won their hearts by 
drinking to their health. When he died, the College spent thirty 
shillings on ‘‘ Blackes,’”’ and lamented him in lamentable verses. 
But Prince Henry from Heaven bade them not despair : 
“Est super ille meus florentibus integer annis 
CAROLUS, est vobis ELISABETHA super.” 5 
In the years that followed this Royal visit Magdalen, we are 
1Macray (II, 103). 
2 Macray (III, 52). In 1585 Bishop Cooper, the Visitor, limited them 
to 13, and attached them to the 13 senior Fellows. But they steadily 
increased. In 1612 they numbered 76, besides 24 Commoners and 10 
“ Battellatores,”” according to Twyne’s figures (XXI, 514). An entry of 
1590 in the Vice-President’s Register again forbade strangers to sleep 
in College rooms. 
3 See Macray (II, 101-2, 117 and 133) and Bloxam (II, Ixii).

138-9). For Bond’s history and the charges against him see Macray

Besides the University elegies, Magdalen men published a little collection 
of their own, and Cambridge produced another collection. The three are 
bound up together at the British Museum. Wood’s statement that the 
Prince matriculated at Magdalen is unproved and may be doubted. But

assured, became “ the very nursery of Puritans.” 1 But that 
did not prevent it from electing a President who supported Laud. 
Accepted Frewen, an able and distinguished ruler, who after the 
Restoration rose to be Archbishop of York, became, in spite of 
early Puritan connections,? a Chaplain of Charles I. He worked 
with Laud in University matters. He set up in the Chapel an 
altar which critics compared to the altars of Bethel. And in 
1642 he took a leading part in raising money for the King.? 
Magdalen men fought for the Crown. Magdalen Grove sheltered 
the King’s guns. Magdalen Walks mounted batteries: the 
mound called Dover Pier remains. Rupert’s trumpeters woke 
echoes in the cloisters. Rupert’s riders gathered, it may be, 
behind the College walls. Charles himself watched the move- 
ments of his army from the tower. When Frewen passed to 
a Bishopric, during the War, John Oliver, trained in the same 
school of loyalty, stepped into his place. Oliver was removed 
by the Commissioners of Parliament; and some twenty-eight 
Fellows and perhaps twenty-one Demies were expelled at the 
same time. The hands of the Visitors fell heavily on the Col- 
lege. Mr. Chibnall, the Bursar, was taken into custody for 
refusing to surrender the keys and books. To replace the 
obstinate Royalists and churchmen new-comers from other Col- 
leges were imported. Some were brought from Cambridge, one 
even from Harvard overseas. John Wilkinson of Magdalen Hall, 
a veteran Puritan, succeeded to Oliver’s post. Cromwell and 
Fairfax dined in the College and played bowls upon its green. 
A store of gold coins found in the Treasury, spur-royals and 
angels, was unhappily appropriated and divided by the Fellows.® 
he had a Magdalen “ governor,” and may even have spoken of himself 
as a Magdalen man. For his visit in 1605 see Wake’s Rex Platonicus 
(6th ed., 178-80) and Macray (III, 36-9). 
1 Its totalnumbers in 1612 Twyne (XXI, 514) puts at 246—though he 
adds his figures up wrongly. 
2 Frewen in early days is said to have been ‘‘ Puritanically inclined ” 
(Wood, Athena, ed. Bliss, IV, 221). Wood credits Magdalen Hall with 
300 members, “ mostly inclining to Calvinism,” in 1624 (Colleges, 686). 
2 In 1642 the King asked for a loan at 8 percent. In January 1643 
he secured the College plate—which the Parliamentary troops had spared 
—except one or two pieces like the Founder’s cup. (See the Vice-Presi- 
dent’s Register, ff. 96-7, and Macray, III, 55-7 and IV, 4.) For Frewen’s 
career see Bloxam (V, 9-20). 
¢Mr. Wilson goes very carefully into this question (164-7). Prof. 
Burrows, who gives the answers of the Fellows on their examination and 
a good deal of information on the subject (Register of Visitors, 79-80, 
97-8, 509 sq., 571, etc.), has an estimate of 65 expulsions, including 
servants, and of 25 submissions. Certainty is not possible, but Mr. 
Wilson is the safest guide. 
5 All members of the College, even the servants, had a share. But it 
seems that a good deal of the money was repaid to the Treasury later 
(Wilson, 168-71).
-P-A-G-E-455
  396 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
But Wilkinson’s health failed quickly: a new appointment was 
needed: and Goodwin, an old Independent minister, reigned 
from 1650 till the Restoration. If Addison’s delicate mockery 
may be trusted, Goodwin’s chief concern was to discover whether 
candidates for admission were or were not of the elect. Receiv- 
ing them in a chamber hung with black, ‘“‘ with half a dozen 
nightcaps upon his head, and a religious horror in his counten- 
ance,” the President would startle the young men by inquiring 
whether they were prepared for death.+ 
When King Charles returned, John Oliver came back again, 
and some five and twenty of the old Fellows and Demies came 
with him. The King interfered with recommendations and the 
Visitor with Injunctions, which were not always happily con- 
ceived. Oliver’s successor, Dr. Pierce, a great champion of the 
Church establishment, was nominated directly by the King, but 
he soon proved “‘ intolerable” to the Fellows. Controversial by 
habit—he was specially well read ‘‘in the quinquarticular con- 
troversies ’’—he found too much delight in controversy with his 
colleagues.2, The appointment, again, of Dr. Clerke by Royal 
mandate in 1672, was little more popular. It was, we are 
assured, as welcome to the College as ‘‘a storm to a fleet.” 
Clerke was a layman and a Doctor of Music. He took Orders 
soon after his election. Critics complained of his laziness. The 
College sank to the level of the times. Clerke’s death in 1687 
produced a famous contest for the Presidency. James II nomi- 
nated Farmer, who was suspected of being a Papist, who was 
known to be a drunkard and a brawler, and who was clearly 
ineligible under the College rules. Even James was forced to 
drop him, and to substitute Parker, the Bishop of Oxford, in 
his stead. But the Fellows had already met and elected John 
Hough, and Hough refused to compromise or to submit. The 
memorable struggle which ensued is a part of English history. 
The country held its breath and waited, while the reckless King 
forced his nominees upon the College, expelled the Fellows who 
resisted, and thrust in Romanists instead. Then the scene 
changed as quickly. The Dutch fleet sailed. The panic-stricken 
King gave way. Hough returned in triumph, the excluded 
Fellows with him. And seventeen new Demies—Addison, Sach- 
everell and Boulter were among them—inaugurated a happier 
era in the “ golden election” of 1689.° 
1 Spectator, No. 494. 
* A cheerful lampoon on Pierce is reprinted by Dr. Bloxam (Register, 
i —6). 
: ny Bloxam’s Magdalen College and King James II gives the fullest 
account of these transactions, and a list of the Fellows expelled (204). 
But see later (vol. II, Chap. XIX). The Buttery Book of 1688 in the 
Library shows the offending names struck out.

  THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 397 
Wolsey is the most imposing personage in the early history 
of the College. But not a few of its members rose to fame. 
Grocyn as Divinity Reader made it the earliest home of the 
Classical Revival in Oxford. Wiliam Lily, the first Master of 
St. Paul’s, Colet, if he ever was a Commoner of Magdalen, and 
the famous Grammar Masters in the College School adjoining, 
carried the tradition on. Archbishop Lee, Wolsey’s successor 
at York, a bitter critic of Erasmus, was one of many eminent 
prelates, even if he was “ arrogant, ignorant and venomous,” 
as Erasmus thought. Cardinal Pole, in his brief hour omnipo- 
tent, was another.1. Bishop Fox, the Founder of Corpus, was 
a third. Morwent, one of the early College Lecturers, became 
afterwards President of Corpus. Foxe, the Martyrologist, and 
Bodley, immortalised by his munificence, were great Elizabeth- 
ans. But Foxe belonged to an older school of early, stubborn 
Protestants. He refused to take Orders or to attend the Col- 
lege Chapel, and he was driven to resign his Fellowship about 
1545. Later on, he placed his son under the care of Laurence 
Humfrey, but the boy, who had no love for Puritan methods, 
ran away abroad.? Camden, the historian, may have been a 
servitor or chorister at Magdalen, before he passed on to Broad- 
gates Hall.? Lyly, the author of Euphues, was trained there ; 
but ‘‘his genie being bent to the pleasant paths of poetry, he 
did in a manner neglect academical studies.” So was Florio, 
the translator of Montaigne, who shared with Shakespeare the 
friendship of Southampton. So was a more sinister but not less 
conspicuous figure, Simon Forman, schoolmaster, astrologer, 
magician, quack—    
   
                 
         
    
               
   
    “There Forman was, that fiend in human shape, 
That by his art did act the devills ape.’’¢ 
Forman’s doubtful services to fashionable ladies were among the 
Imany scandals of King James’ Court. Sir Ralph Winwood, one 
lof James’ Ambassadors, and Sir Thomas Roe, who was not only 
an Ambassador but a pioneer of adventure in the East, were 
lworthier representatives of the spirit of the time. 
1It seems probable that Pole was a Commoner of Magdalen before 
ie was nominated a Fellow of Corpus. 
2Dr. Bloxam (Register, IV, 194-6) quotes the letters exchanged 
between John Foxe and Laurence Humfrey, from the originals in the 
‘Bodleian. 
* But he is not in the list of choristers (Ib. I, 17-18). 
“See Sir Thomas Overburies Vision (by R. N., Richard Niccols, 34), 
and Sir S. Lee’s article in Dict. of Nat. Biog. But Cambridge gave For- 
iman his license to practise medicine. Mr. Wilson mentions some well- 
known names of Commoners (129, n.) who are not dealt with by Bloxam 
lor Macray. For Lyly at Magdalen see Mr. Warwick Bond’s Life in vol. I 
lof his edition of Lyly’s Works (6-16).

  398 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
There are many names and many episodes worth mention 
in the College records. The fifteenth-century President who 
lived to the age of a hundred, anticipating an illustrious suc- 
cessor, the sixteenth-century divine, John Piers, who took to 
tippling in an ale-house, and then, curing himself of his bad 
habits, became Master of Balliol, Dean of Christ Church and a 
great Elizabethan Archbishop of York,? the seventeenth-cen- 
tury scholar who saw the Devil grovelling on the floor of his 
bedroom, attired like a Bishop in lawn sleeves, and appropriately 
preceded by ‘‘a noise like the noise of geese,” illustrate the 
infinite variety of College life. The entries in the accounts are 
full of homely little items—charges for a “ gelycloth” and a 
barber’s basin in 1481, twopence halfpenny in 1484 for holly 
and ivy for Christmas decorations, a penny to two scholars for 
cleaning the Bursary in 1525, one shilling and sixpence for a 
chimney-sweep at the President’s house in 1627, twenty-eight 
pounds in the days of Queen Elizabeth for wainscoting the Hall. 
We have charges in 1561 of some forty-five shillings for setting 
up a theatre,’ and of fourpence for taking it away. Plays for 
acting in the Hall were sometimes written by the Master of the 
College School. We hear in 1553 of the buying of ‘‘ marmi- 
lade’ for College use, of putrid fish given still earlier to prisoners 
by a charity determined not to pauperise the poor,* of Demies 
who in 1616 insisted on dining in Hall in hats instead of caps, 
of the ill-judged claim of an Earl’s son to sit above all the other 
Fellows—a matter which the King had to be asked to settle, 
as the Visitor thought it “ too big and too high”’ for him. The 
details of a Gentleman Commoner’s expenditure in the days 
when Oliver Cromwell ruled England show few signs of Puritan 
restraint : eighty pounds for tutoring, ten pounds for ‘‘ a College 
pott,”’ six pounds for “a tawny gowne,” two pounds for a hat 
and silver band. To the four hundred and seventy-eight pounds 
spent in two years mercers, glovers and booksellers alike con- 
tribute. And the young man’s expenditure on his marriage 
soon afterwards—two hundred and fifty-two pounds for a rope 
of pearl, seventy pounds and more for laces, twenty-four pounds 
for a silver warming-pan, a hundred pounds for “ treating when 
wife brought home” *—reveals a certain lavishness of temper 
which an Oxford education had done little to repress.

year (Bloxam, Magdalen College and James II, 160-1).

  THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 399 
From Tyndale’s day onwards Magdalen Hall was a Puritan 
centre, and Puritan associations had a powerful influence on the 
College life. Edward Hyde never belonged to the College, but 
even he may not have been altogether untouched by the tradi- 
tions of the Hall. John Wilkinson was Head of both. John 
Hampden joined the College as a boy of fifteen.?, By the irony 
of fortune, the cup which he gave it went to swell the war-chest 
of the King. George Wither, the Puritan poet, sang to its 
“sweet delightful fountains” a few songs whose melody has 
never ceased to charm. 
‘Shall I, wasting in despair, 
Die because a woman’s fair?” 
There was little in such a theme to separate Puritan and Cavalier. 
On the other side Peter Heylyn, uncompromising Royalist and 
churchman, earned the reputation of a “ bluster-master”’ with 
those who distrusted his history of his time. ‘‘ Holy’? Hammond 
and Bishop Warner of Rochester, like Heylyn resolute friends 
of the establishment, were Chaplains to Charles I and eminent 
and lovable divines. Bishop Mews* of Winchester, the College 
Visitor, was present at Sedgemoor. Mews warned the Fellows 
not to press their claim to nominate the Principals of Magdalen 
Hall. But they refused to take his advice; they challenged 
the rights of the Chancellor, the Duke of Ormonde; and the 
Law-Courts disposed of their plea. “ Rabbi” Smith was a 
learned Orientalist expelled with many colleagues in 1687. 
Robert Charnock was James II’s most obstinate supporter, and 
died later for his share in a plot to assassinate William III. In 
the same stormy times Addison passed from Queen’s to a Demy- 
ship at Magdalen, to become an inseparable part of her traditions,> 
and George Hickes, the stout Non-juror, passed from his Deanery 
to a life of persecution.* Other figures famous or familiar in the 
Oxford of their day are commemorated in the College monuments, 
which have found a historian of their own.? The effigy of 
William Tybard, the first President, re-discovered in 1911, has 
1 Though recommended for a Demyship by James I. 
2 He is so described in the matriculation register, but the date of his 
birth is not quite certain. 
8 This is the spelling on his tomb in Winchester Cathedral. 
4See Bloxam (V, 276-0). 
5 Addison, says Mr. Buckler (Observations on the Original Architecture 
of St. Mary Magdalen College, Oxford, 62-3), lived in a room on the East 
side of the main quadrangle, which no longer exists: in a chamber and 
study at the N.E. angle, adds Mr. Gunther, from Buckler’s MS. notes 
(St. John’s Cart. III, 400).

been restored to its place in the floor of the Chapel whose building 
long ago he watched. Memorials to several of his successors 
still remain. A music master whose fierce zeal for the Chapel 
music led him to kidnap a boy at Malmesbury and to bring him 
back in chains, deserves a line of record if not of respect. And 
Wood has dwelt upon the touching monument set up to John 
and Thomas Lyttelton in 1635, one aged seventeen, the other 
thirteen only, “ quos innoxie obambulantes in campo minorem 
lubricus pes in undam misit.” The elder died in trying to save 
his brother from drowning, and Cowley, then a school-boy at 
Westminster, wrote an elegy on both. 
The College buildings, the loveliest in Oxford, embody some 
fragments of the old Hospital of St. John.1. The arch of the 
Pilgrim’s Gate is still to be seen in the wall upon the High Street. 
The main walls of the old Hospital Chapel close by it and of the 
vaulted chamber below are standing yet. Outlying parts of the 
Hospital were probably left while a site for the new quadrangle 
was cleared within. On the South side of this quadrangle Chapel 
and Hall were placed together. Wykeham’s design was followed, 
Wykeham’s workmanship in some respects surpassed. A cloister 
of singular beauty grew up round the other three sides, with 
buildings overhead. The ‘‘lavacrum”’ occupied the centre. 
The President, the Fellows, the College Library, were lodged in 
chambers round. The Founder’s Tower or “ great tower,’”’ soon 
to be dwarfed by a greater, rose with its rich and delicate orna- 
ment over the entrance to the cloister from the West. It was, 
no doubt, intended to mark the main access to the College,* 
1 These fragments are probably older than any other College build- 
ings in Oxford except parts of Christ Church. Mr. J. C. Buckler (Obser- 
vations, 13) estimates the precinct of the Hospital at 94 acres, 1 rood, 
24 perches. His Rough Notes on the Hospital history are preserved 
(MS. 27,963) at the British Museum, and Mr. Gunther has founded on 
them an Essay which is printed as Appendix III in the third volume of 
Mr. Salter’s Cartulary of the Hospital. The main parts of the Hospital 
which survived the foundation of the College, seem to have been the 
North wall of the cloister, which survived till the rebuilding of 1824, the 
building beyond it—the “‘ Stables ’”—removed in the eighteenth century, 
and once possibly the home of the Hospital Sisters, the Chapel with the 
vaulted room below it on the High Street, used in the sixteenth century 
as a lecture-room and an almshouse, and the College kitchen. A good 
deal of very early stone-work is probably built into the walls of the Chap- 
lains’ Quadrangle. The Hospital was a place where travellers or sick 
people might be received for a time (Salter, Caviulary, III, xiv.) It had 
more than one chapel. See also Wilson (Magdalen, 12-13) and the little 
old drawing reproduced from a MS. of Matthew Paris by Mr. Salter (III, 433). 
2 The South side was not intended to have buildings over it, and was 
not at first completed. 
* Buckler (Observations, 36) cannot forgive the President who closed 
and planted out this gateway, and substituted as the main entrance “a 
contiguous porch,”
-P-A-G-E-460
  THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 401 
and it contained the principal chamber of the President’s quarters. 
A second tower, to hold the College muniments, its porch adorned 
with splendid stone-work, stood at the North-west corner of 
the Chapel. A third, where the Song School probably was held, 
has long been swept away.1_ The kitchen lay to the East between 
the Hall and the river. The Chapel, it seems, was finished by 
the summer of 1480, when the new buildings came into use?: 
four centuries since have added to its spell. The Ante-Chapel, to 
which Orchard gave a great West window, included a short 
nave and two short aisles. The high altar was placed in the 
choir. Outside, on the South of the choir, was a small square 
transept which has vanished. In the wall on the North side was 
a small oratory with a second altar. There were six other altars 
in the nave. The doorway on the West was sheltered by a 
shallow porch, a masterpiece of stone-work, where statues of 
Waynflete and St. Mary Magdalen, of Henry III and St. John 
the Baptist filled the places of honour, and where among the 
Founder’s devices his lilies and roses recurred. The main gate 
into the College precincts was for long the gate facing the Chapel 
on the West. And further West, where now lies St. Swithun’s 
Quadrangle, and where the ancient bell-turret still survives, 
were the Grammar School, begun in 1480, and the buildings 
which grew up about it to house the students whom it taught, 
known before long by the name of Magdalen Hall.* 
The Founder died in 1486, but the work of building went 
on. Before the end of the century there were additional quarters 
for the President. The ‘‘ house of the School of the Choristers ”’ 
was finished. The South cloister and the great gate were put 
up. A few years later the delightful figures which ornament 
the cloister buttresses, strange types of learning, Scripture and 
heraldic ingenuity, appeared.® In 1492, when Wolsey was 
1See Agas’ map. Mr. Wilson thinks (24) that this tower, in the wall 
towards the meadows, was probably the Song School. It stood at the 
Cherwell end of the New Buildings of 1734. The earliest choristers’ 
school was near the kitchen (Bloxam, I, iii). See Wilson’s ground-plan 
(30-1). 2 There is 1d. charged in the accounts for ‘“‘ glew pro organis emen- 
dandis ” in 1481. Buta new and expensive pair of organs was apparently 
supplied in 1486 (Bloxam, II, xcvi). 
* This name appears about the beginning of the sixteenth century. 
It was first called the Grammar Hall. The College owned the land and 
provided most of the Principals. But the Hall was a separate society, 
and finally it made good its independence. 
«Probably on the site of the present Lodgings. The President had 
also for some time a London house, and entries for repairs to it occur in 
the accounts occasionally up to 1601 (Macray, VIII, 91). 
5 Mr. Reeks, a Fellow who died in 1675, has left a MS. in the College 
Library which treats these figures as an allegorical series. They date 
from 1508-9.

  402 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
probably a member of the College, the President laid the corner- 
stone of the matchless Tower which overhangs the Cherwell, 
“Prick’d with incredible pinnacles into heaven.” 
But there is no evidence beyond a vain tradition that Wolsey had 
any part inits building.1 Raynold, the mason, deserves a larger 
share of credit for the grave charm and splendour of a monument 
which few in the cities of men surpass. After twelve or thirteen 
years of labour its exquisite proportions were completed. Its 
bells were installed—‘ the most tuneable and melodious in all 
these parts.’ New buildings joined it to the Hall on one side 
and to the ancient Chapel of the Hospital on another, forming 
the small irregular court now known as the Chaplains’ Quadrangle.® 
Perhaps on some May morning of those early summers the 
custom of singing on the Tower arose. But no white-robed 
choristers began it. No solemn chanting marked the obit of a 
King. The motive, it seems, was frolic rather than devotion. 
At any rate the spirit of frolic prevailed. In Wood’s day they 
sang part-songs to ‘“‘salute Flora every year.’ In the middle 
of the eighteenth century there was a regular concert. ‘‘ Merry 
Ketches”’ and instruments were used. And it was only by 
degrees, and perhaps from motives of convenience, that this 
gave place to the singing of a hymn by the choir, a hymn written 
by a Fellow of the College and set to music by the College 
organist in the days of Charles -II.4 . 
The reign of Henry VIII saw improvements made in the 
Lodgings and the Chapel, and beautiful panelling introduced 
into the Hall. Soon after, there is a curious reference in the 
accounts to the burning of the organs, but whether this was due 
to accident or to iconoclasm we are not told. In Protestant 
1 Buckler (Observations, 26) explains that the tower, 145 ft. high, 
“consists of four stories, unequally proportioned, and each more con- 
tracted than the other.” To help the College with the cost of building, 
the tax of the fifteenth was remitted by the Crown (Macray, I, 25). 
Chandler (Waynflete, Appendix XXXII) gives details of early expendi- 
ture on the tower. 
2 But Wood is, no doubt, speaking of the new chimes given after the 
Restoration. 
* The tower may have been meant at first to stand alone. The Gal- 
lery or Election Chamber, to the North of the Lodgings, which Dr. Good- 
win made so mysterious, and which the eighteenth century swept away, 
dated from the same period. 
« There is no reason to suppose that mass was ever said on the tower. 
The hymn—taken from the College grace written in the seventeenth cen- 
tury—was not introduced till nearly the end of the eighteenth century. 
5 At any rate at the West end, where the date 1541 remains. Buckler 
(Observations, 82, n.) gives the extreme length of the Hall as 73 ft., the 
breadth as 30 ft. 6 in.
-P-A-G-E-462
  THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 403 
changes the altars were destroyed. The vestments ! and treas- 
ures of the Chapel were dispersed. Seats were allotted to the 
President’s wife: Humfrey, the first married President, had 
not only an unpardonable wife but twelve unpardonable children. 
A new organ was bought in 1597. James I’s visit led to some 
further improvements, including probably the noble screen between 
the Buttery and the Hall. The statues in the cloister were 
refreshed with paint. And in the same reign Magdalen Hall, 
filled with Puritans, overflowed its borders, and new buildings 
were added beside the Grammar School.2 In Laud’s day 
President Frewen restored the Chapel and beautified it further. 
New wood-work, new glass, new paving were provided. Richard 
Greenbury’s Ante-Chapel windows of 1635 were spared by the 
Puritan soldiers, who are said to have trampled on the older 
glass which the College attempted to conceal. The design of 
the West window was unfortunately altered, to convert it into a 
better picture-frame. An eagle-lectern also was established ; 
but the innovations gave offence.? Outside, Inigo Jones, if the 
tradition may be trusted, set up a new and stately gateway in 
the West wall of the College. A block of rooms, meant principally 
for Commoners, was built near the river on the East.5 Parlia- 
mentary violence did little to harm the buildings. Windows 
and statues may have suffered, but even the portraits of Charles 
and his Queen in the oriel of the Hall survived. Evelyn notes 
in 1654 that the Double Organ, though held to be an ‘‘ abomina- 
tion,” had been left undisturbed. Cromwell took it to Hampton 
Court, but the Restoration gave it back to the College. 
The Restoration brought other changes also. The ancient 
Chapel on the High Street with the vaulted room below it, 
which had survived from the old Hospital, was converted into 
chambers.* But the open-air pulpit in the corner, where for 
1The vestments were very fine. We hear of over 100 chasubles of 
the richest make and colour (Bloxam, II, xii). 
2 The present Grammar Hall represents in part the original fifteenth- 
century grammar school, and in part some early seventeenth-century 
additions to Magdalen Hall (Wilson, 29 and 144). 
3’ The lectern and the seventeenth-century windows of the Ante-Chapel 
are there now (Wilson, 146-8 and notes) after some vicissitudes. On the 
painted glass see Mr. Grinling’s paper, often cited (Oxf. Architect. Soc., 
N.S., IV, 111 sq.). 
« But there is no reliable evidence that any work in Oxford was done 
by Inigo Jones. The ancient Cross outside the Hospital, and possibly in 
the Brethren’s cemetery, stood, it seems likely, not in the street leading 
to the bridge, but inside the College grounds, in the corner between the 
old gate on the West and the new gate on the South (St. John’s Cartu- 
lary, III, 423). 
5It is now the kitchen staircase.

centuries past, with some intermissions, a sermon has been 
preached to the University on St. John the Baptist’s day, 
connects it with the College Chapel still. The East end of the 
Chapel was adorned with paintings, which Addison extolled in 
Latin verses, but which a later critic thought unworthy even of 
the walls of the kitchen.2. The Library, which Waynflete had 
enriched with books * and fenced with regulations, was munifi- 
cently increased. The old vestry below the Hall became a 
Common Room for Fellows. The Grove and Walks were care- 
fully planted, and many an elm of that day stands. The 
immemorial Founder’s Oak has been called “‘ one of the vegetable 
wonders of the island.’’* ‘Go into the Water-Walks,” cries 
Wood delightedly. ‘‘ You will find them as delectable as the 
banks of Eurotas, where Apollo himself was wont to walk and 
sing his lays.” 5 : 
ordered these chambers to be made on the Restoration. Mr. Buckler, it 
seems (22), would date them thirty years earlier, and we hear of four beds 
for temporary lodgers being placed in a room over the vault of the old 
Chapel before the Rebellion. The old Hospital Chapel stood just South 
of the later Ante-Chapel, and East of the present porter’s lodge. It was 
a lecture-room in the days of Henry VIII, and the vault below, once a 
charnel-house, was then an almshouse. Skelton (Oxon. Ant. Pl. 156) 
reproduces a corner of it. Ingram (Memorials, II, Magdalen, 13) gives a 
better view. See also Wilson (12, n., 84, n., and 265-6), and St. John’s 
Cartulary (III, 404 sq.).

St. John, the great Register begun by Dr. J. R. Bloxam and continued

Mr. H. A. Wilson’s admirable history of the College contain stores of 
information. Mr. Wilson very kindly answered several questions which 
I put to him; and the College authorities—I ought specially to thank 
the President, Vice-President, Librarian and Bursar—allowed me to 
consult some of the records in the Library and in the Archives. Apart 
from the early charters and accounts, the Computi and Bursars’ Rolls, 
which are full of interesting details, the most important volumes are the 
Vice-President’s Register—beginning in 1547, growing very scanty during 
the Civil War, and breaking down altogether, except for a few scattered 
entries, after 1686; another volume of 84 pages also kept in the Library 
(Reg. Coll. Magd. C.), relating to the years from 1538 to 1615; and four 
volumes in the Bursar’s keeping, labelled Ledgers A, B, C and D, which 
contain the Register of the College from about 1480 to 1550. These four 
“ledgers,” full of deeds, elections, College events and miscellaneous 
entries, are not perfectly continuous, but sometimes overlap. Dr. Macray 
has a note on these Registers and on other authorities which he consulted

THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 405 
Two or three other Colleges were founded in fifteenth-century 
Oxford, of which only fragments and traditions now remain. 
On land which lay to the East of the North Bailey, afterwards 
called the Lane of the Seven Deadly Sins,1 Henry VI granted 
leave in 1435 for the foundation of a College of Augustinian 
Canons. Thomas Holden and Elizabeth his wife gave a house 
and gardens valued at forty shillings yearly to the Prior of the 
Holy Trinity, London, on which to build a home for students 
in Oxford.?_ The new settlement was soon known as St. Mary’s 
College; and Wood gathered up two hundred years later such 
details of its history as he could. We hear of its Hall, its Library, 
its Chapel, and of the young Canons maintained there by the 
great Abbeys of the Order. The Chapel, ‘‘a very faire fabrick 
built with freestone, and very good workmanship to be seen about 
it,” supplied in the end materials for the Chapel of Brasenose 
College. Wood noted that the rules and customs of St. Mary’s 
resembled those of ‘‘ our auncientest colledges.” Its Statutes 
are preserved in the Bodleian.* The kitchen and pantry were 
protected contva Batellarios. The Library regulations forbade 
students to monopolise any book for more than two hours, or 
to take a candle into the building at night.4 We have a list of 
the College Priors. Richard Charnock, the host of Erasmus, 
was a scholar worthy even of the guest he entertained. Robert 
Ferrar, afterwards Bishop of St. David’s, was a Canon of the 
House, a Reformer in the days of Wolsey, and a “‘ valiant martyr ” 
in Queen Mary’s reign. We have a curious little inventory of 
the College possessions in 1541.5 We have notes on its vicissitudes 
after the Dissolution. It served as a charity school and an 
almshouse. There was talk of reviving it under Cardinal Pole. 
In the days of Elizabeth it was conveyed to Brasenose College, 
and Frewen Hall now stands upon its site.6 But the gateway 
of the old House where Erasmus lodged with Charnock and 
traces of the cloister are still to be seen. And something of the 
spirit of Erasmus, his joyousness, his eager zest in disputation, 
in the preface to the first volume of his Register (viii-x). On the build- 
ings and the brasses of Magdalen Mr. Vallance (Old Colleges of Oxford) 
has some interesting notes.

-P-A-G-E-467
    406 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
lives again in the Hall, a stone’s throw distant, where the heirs 
of medieval Oxford gather for debate. 
St. Bernard’s College, for Cistercian students, was the last 
House built for monks in Oxford. Rewley no longer supplied 
what they needed, and Cistercian scholars were scattered among 
the different Halls. Chichele, no monk himself, received the 
King’s license to found it in 1437,1 the very year in which he 
bought the site for his more famous College. The land which 
he gave to the Cistercians lay to the North, beyond the wall and 
beyond the lands of Balliol and Durham. But it is probable 
that the Archbishop gave little except a site and a license for 
the endowment of the College.2- The Cistercian Houses supported 
the monks. Cistercian Abbots contributed to the buildings, and 
Richard III by precept rather than example encouraged their 
generosity to flow. The College Statutes, issued in 1446 by the 
Abbot of Morimund in the far-distant diocese of Langres, provided 
for a religious community whose ruler was also its confessor, 
and for priests to say Mass at least three times a week. A grant 
by King Henry VI to William Bramley, the first Prior, and a 
record of the early rulers of the College remain. The rooms 
where the monks lived, the Chapel they served and the Hall 
they dined in—the Hall was built in 1502, the Chapel consecrated 
in 1530—still form a part of the outer quadrangle of St. John’s. 
The College was granted to Christ Church after the Dissolution, 
and a description of the buildings dating from the days of spolia- 
tion is preserved. But the figure of St. Bernard still dreams 
above the gateway, indifferent to the desecration of his courts 
within. 
Two other little Colleges of mediceval Oxford, London College 
1See Cal. Pat. Rolls (1436-41, pp. 45-6) and Dugdale (Monasticon, V, 
746). I do not know Dr. Rashdall’s authority for giving the date (II, 
479) aS 1432. The foundation deeds in the Cistercian Register (ff. 43-45%, 
not 93») which he refers to (MS. University College, 167), now at the Bod- 
leian, do not seem to bear out this earlier date. Dr. Craster drew my 
attention also to the original ordinances for the government of the Col- 
lege by John, Abbot of Morimund in the Bodleian (Oxford Charters, 180), 
to Smith’s notice of which Dr. Rashdall and Sir H. M. Lyte (342) refer. 
The MS. is badly stained and partly illegible now. 
2 Hovenden indeed suggested that Chichele only passed on to the 
monks land which he found unsuitable for All Souls. Wood credits the 
Archbishop with building the College, but it seems to have been unfinished 
half a century later. In 1421 the Augustinians had asked Henry V for 
land for a College on or near this site (Collectanea, III, 153). Dugdale 
(Monasticon, ed. 1846, V, 746) and Wood (City, II, 306) suggest that 
Chichele gave 5 acres: but a MS. history at St. John’s puts the College 
site and gardens at 2 acres in Henry VIII’s day (Fourth Report, Hist. 
MSS. Comm. 468). 
3 See the View of Barnard College, in the same MS. as the account of 
Durham College (Record Office, Rentals and Surveys, Roll 548).
-P-A-G-E-468
  THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY COLLEGES 407 
and St. George’s College, are even less remembered now. The 
House of St. George’s Canons in the Castle, originally founded 
by Robert d’Oili, was for many generations a dependency of 
Oseney. It seems to have been re-established or re-organised in 
the fifteenth century as a College for students, with Statutes 
and a Warden of its own. The Statutes are in the Bodleian 
Library, bound up with the Statutes of St. Mary’s. Wood 
describes it rather vaguely, and repeats the story that Henry V 
had planned to build a College here.1 He speaks of Scholar 
Priests maintained in it for the service of the church, and of 
other Scholars “being in all 12, except commoners.” He 
mentions that they were forbidden, among other rules, to clamber 
over the Castle walls at night. He alleges that they were for 
the most part Welsh and very poor. And it seems clear that 
by the time of the Dissolution their numbers at least were greatly 
reduced. London College may have had a longer history. But 
it also had a chequered life. Burnel’s Inn, established in the 
thirteenth century among buildings once in the possession of 
the Jews, was acquired in the days of Henry IV by Richard 
Clifford, Bishop of London. It received a legacy of a thousand 
marks for the support of its scholars on the Bishop’s death. 
But when this money ran out, the College endowment apparently 
ended. The name of London College survived for some time, 
and lasted, it is said, into the seventeenth century. But its 
existence must always have been precarious, even if Wolsey 
did not sweep it away. Our knowledge, however, of these 
Houses is admittedly inadequate, and the empire of the monks 
was already passing when the Statutes of St. Mary’s, St. Bernard’s 
and St. George’s were drawn up. The great Orders had learned 
to appreciate education better. They had realised the value 
of securing for their students the training which a University 
alone could give. But the part played by the monastic Colleges 
in the intellectual life of Oxford was from first to last compara- 
tively small. They cannot be said to have contributed much 
on the whole to the cause of education or to the enlightenment 
of the nation and the Church. 
1 For Wood’s account of St. George’s, St. Mary’s and St. Bernard’s 
see City (II, Ch. XXXI). The St. George’s College Statutes are in 
Bodl. MS. Rawl. Stat. 34 (ff. 25%-30%). Oseney may have felt bound 
todo something in the fifteenth century for education. But how much 
there was in the old foundation to build on it is difficult to say. 
2 On London College see Appendix XXV in Dean Rashdall’s second 
volume, and Wood (City, I, 157-9, and II, 88). Wood mentions also a 
College planned by Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, ‘‘ about the latter 
end of Edw. I,” and another projected by Sir Peter Besils who died in 
1424 (Colleges, 650-1).

  CHAPTER X 
THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW AGE 
ITH the death of the last Plantagenet King at Bosworth 
the Middle Ages camé to an end. Medieval Oxford, 
with its cramped and venerable system, its unendowed 
teachers, its many little struggling Halls, its small Colleges intended 
principally for graduates and standing to a large extent apart, 
slowly gave place to newer things. Strange dreams of power and 
knowledge took possession of men’s minds. The Classical Revival 
threatened the old philosophies and the old traditional religion. 
A cultivated Paganism sprang up at its side. But before the 
Renaissance could take root in England, it had to adapt itself 
to the English temper, to convince practical men of its usefulness, 
to fit itself into the framework of University life. The Florence 
of Lorenzo, of Politian, of Macchiavelli laid her spell on the 
scholars of Oxford, but to the graver minds of the new generation 
it was with the voice of Savonarola that she spoke. Colet 
returned from Italy to expound not Plato but St. Paul, to use 
the New Learning to interpret Scripture, to plead for a new spirit 
in the English Church. Erasmus brought his laughing wit to 
ridicule hypocrisy, his wide and fearless scholarship to plead for 
peace and freedom. More turned away from Macchiavelli’s 
statecraft to dream with delicate and wistful fancy of common- 
wealths in which the claims of Labour counted, which made 
“gentle provision”’ even for the poor. Wolsey, the strongest 
and stateliest representative of the system that was passing, saw 
almost as clearly as the Oxford Reformers the imperative need of 
reform, and, had time and power been spared him, he might 
perhaps have re-organised the world of Oxford as vigorously as 
he strove to re-organise the European world beyond. 
Yet the early years of the Tudor era brought no sudden change. 
The University, fresh from its compliments to Yorkist Princes, 
was a little anxious about its own safety. Lambert Simnel was 
the son of an Oxford joiner.1 Bishop Stillington of Bath and 
Wells, a prominent Yorkist involved in his conspiracy, took refuge 
1 This is the official account in the Rolls of Parliament (VI, 397). Wood 
(Annals, I, 643) calls the father an organ-maker, other accounts a shoe- 
maker and a baker. (But see Reg. Ann. Coll. Merton. xxxiii).

in the University town. The King claimed the Bishop’s surrender, 
and the Masters were greatly troubled as to whether they ought 
or ought not to give him up.1_ In 1488 Henry VII visited Oxford, 
accompanied by the Chancellor, Bishop Russell of Lincoln. He 
made a modest offering in Magdalen Chapel, and gave forty oaks 
from Shotover towards the re-building of St. Mary’s Church. 
Later on he established an obit for the widow of the famous King- 
maker, and memorial services for his own parents, his wife and 
himself, By an “indenture quatripartite,” to which the King and 
the Mayor of London were parties, the Monastery of Westminster 
promised ten pounds to maintain these services, “ yerely for euer 
while the world shall endure.’’* Henry, equally unconscious of 
the future, founded three Divinity Scholarships for Westminster 
monks.? Prince Arthur visited Oxford more than once, and was 
entertained at Magdalen: we have a proclamation of 1501 regula- 
ting the price of beer during his stay. He intervened, like his 
relatives, in the election of University Bedels, but not with the 
happiest results. The Lady Margaret, his grandmother, immor- 
talised by two noble Colleges at Cambridge, founded at Oxford 
the earliest Professorship which still exists. In 1497 Edmund 
Wylford, a Bachelor of Theology, was appointed to lecture on the 
“ Quodlibeta of the Subtle Doctor,’ and in 1502 the post was put 
on a permanent footing and a salary of twenty marks assigned. 
The conditions insisted on a daily lecture,® and provided by a 
biennial election against neglect of duty through incompetence 
or age. It is significant, if the record be true, that a ‘‘ very 
great multitude of hearers” could still be drawn to listen to the 
theology of Duns Scotus in the Oxford Schools.* 
Meanwhile the life of the University went upon its way. 
Bishop Russell was succeeded as Chancellor by Morton, and after 
Morton’s death the election of Mayew, President of Magdalen, 
again gave the Masters aresident Head.” But in 1506 Archbishop 
Warham’s long reign began. Warham had many ties with Oxford. 
He had been a Fellow of New College and Moderator of the School

of Civil Law. He was an able lawyer, drawn into diplomacy and 
politics like other ecclesiastical statesmen of the time. But with 
all his gifts and his generous sympathy for the scholars of the 
Renaissance, he was not a man to strike out on new lines of his 
own. Lovable indeed the Archbishop must have been, “ one of 
the best of men,” Erasmus called him, wise, judicious, learned, 
modest, active in business, a saint in character, a gracious giver, 
a kind and witty friend But Warham lived in difficult times. 
All his energies perhaps were needed to keep on good terms with 
an encroaching Cardinal and an arbitrary King. “Ira principis 
mors est,” he pleaded weakly when Catharine of Arragon in her 
hour of trial turned to him for support. And statesmen so 
readily impressed with danger are rarely found to be courageous 
in reform. 
While Warham ruled, new Colleges were founded. Brasenose 
followed the old lines. Corpus breathed the spirit of the Renais- 
sance. And presently Wolsey’s great foundation rose upon the 
ruin of St. Frideswide’s to eclipse them all. The Heads of Colleges 
began to exercise more influence in the University. The younger 
Regents lost their predominance: the Tudors relied rather on 
the older men. While the Colleges increased, the Halls were 
rapidly declining. ‘‘ Stars,’ said Fuller, ‘‘lose their light when 
the sun ariseth.’ The Warden of New College declared in 1526 
that sixteen Halls had ‘‘ decayed in these few years,” and that 
only a hundred and forty scholars in all the Halls were left.? 
Over sixty Halls are mentioned as surviving in the middle of the 
fifteenth century,? but during the next two or three generations 
most of these disappeared. 
In the meantime the old dispensations continued to ease the 
rigour of the academic system. We have Graces granted freely, 
for the preaching of a sermon, for a musical composition, for 
saying a Mass for the soul of the University’s Founder, whom even 
devout worshippers might have found it difficult toname. There 
is a curious little record in 1513 of a reduction of fees granted 
to a Minorite under pledge of secrecy; no one must be told.4 
Pestilence continued to play havoc in the University. Wood notes 
in August 1485 “a strange and unheard of sickness,” which in 
1 See the Appendix to Mr. Lupton’s Lives of Vitriey and Colet, and the 
Letters of Erasmus passim, with the fine, free versions given by Mr. Froude. 
2 Letters and Papers (ed. Brewer, IV, 1221). Wood suggests (Amn. I, 
661) that about 1503 there were 33 Halls slenderly inhabited. Mr. 
Salter (Med. Aych. I, v) puts them at that date as low as 10. But 
Register @ (f. tor) gives a list of 59 in 1501—though many of them 
may have been only weak survivals. It is possible that the Warden’s 
estimate was not far wrong.

a few weeks “ dispersed and killed most of the Scholars.”! Next 
year there was another “‘ pestilential Disease,” and in the years 
that followed constant outbreaks. In 1517 the sweating sickness, 
apparently a virulent form of influenza, appeared. The King 
rushed from house to house in a panic. Wolsey was prostrated 
and his life despaired of. Four hundred students, it was wildly 
rumoured, had died at Oxford in a single week. When the Court 
moved to Abingdon, More bade the citizens of Oxford hang out 
wisps of straw asa warning of infection.2. Lectures were dispensed 
with. Leave was granted readily. From Merton and Oriel, from 
Magdalen, University and New College, the Fellows fled to country 
quarters or dispersed to their homes. Other maladies arose from 
bad drainage and bad sanitation. The dirt of medizval cities is 
now happily forgotten, but judged by our standards it was a 
gross and unclean age, Students fell off. The Schools were full 
of “‘ querks and sophistry.’”” The Mendicants were degenerate, the 
best scholars tinged with “ Wiclivism.” All things, whether 
taught or written, ‘‘ seemed to be trite and inane.’ Populous 
streets, Wood adds, were deserted. Oxford rents fell ominously.4 
Apathy descended on University and town. In 1523 the 
authorities wrote to Sir Thomas More : 
“We are of the poor. Once we had each our yearly grant, some 
from noblemen, some from those who support monasteries, many from 
priests who have country livings. Now, however, those who ought 
to give assistance refuse to do so. Abbots fetch their monks home, 
noblemen send for their children, and priests for their relations. So 
is the number of scholars diminished. So our halls fall down. So 
all liberal customs grow cold. The Colleges alone persist.” § 
In the town the old quarrels with the scholars, which had 
perhaps been growing less notorious, blazed out afresh. An 
audacious vintner named John Haynes, successively Bailiff and 
Mayor of Oxford, disturbed the University’s dignity and peace. 
He sold bad wine. He flouted academical authority. He stirred 
up clerks and monks to attack one of the Proctors in the dead 
of night. And he seems to have found a good many admirers, 
though he was eventually brought to book and driven from the 
1 Annals (I, 642).

and the years which followed, especially in 1528 and 1529.

should be accepted with some reserve. 
« E.g. the Oxford rents of St. John’s Hospital were £129 in 1293, but 
only £66 in 1478 (Salter, Cartulary of St. John’s, III, 29). But the largest 
part of the fall was due probably to the Black Death.

town.!_ There were troubles with the watch.? It did little credit 
to the University’s administration of justice when scholars who 
had killed one of the ‘“‘ Kinges wachemen” and wounded and 
insulted others, were sentenced only to say Masses, to pay six 
and eightpence as a fine, and one and eightpence to repair a 
Bedel’s staff. There were troubles over prices and over the 
Vice-Chancellor’s inquiries into the sale of food; the town 
Bailiffs would not empanel juries to assist him. There were 
complaints about the University’s jurisdiction and attempts at 
retaliation by the Mayor. But the townsmen as usual found that 
they gained nothing by appealing to higher authorities, while 
churchmen like Warham or Wolsey held the reins of power. 
Nor were “the vulgar sort of scholars”” more amenable to 
discipline than their contemporaries in the town. A certain John 
Roys, ‘‘a lusty son of Venus,” seems among other offences to 
have turned highwayman and to have robbed scholars near the 
gates. But it isnot clear that he suffered any punishment beyond - 
giving sureties to the University Steward to answer for what he 
had done. Another impetuous gentleman broke into a lady’s 
house to woo her with eight armed companions at his back. He 
seized his mistress and put her in prison, says the Court Register 
demurely, ‘‘ investing himself (falsely) with proctorial powers.’ 
The lady denied that she had ever encouraged him, and the 
offender had to pay her twenty-six shillings and eightpence, to 
repair the doors which he had broken and to spend a fortnight 
in Bocardo himself.6 A long interrogatory in one of the old 
Registers 7 preserves the misdeeds of “‘ ser Gytto and ser Gryffyth,”’ 
who armed themselves and others for a fray in Easter week. The 
offenders cited “‘yn payn of the grett curse’’ included two 
Canons of St. Frideswide’s and a monk of Abingdon, and one 
of them was driven to confess to the enormity of having heard 
Mass after ‘‘ he had perfytt knowlege by hys wyffe that he was 
excommunicat.’’ There were students still who went poaching 
  1See Wood (Ann. I, 663, and II, 12-3) and Lyte (424-6). 
2 But there was also some co-operation. In January 1450 University 
and Town agreed to provide for a time four scholars and four townsmen to 
form a night watch at the four gates of the town (Registrum Aa, f. 7). 
3 See Records of the City of Oxford (ed. W. H. Turner, 25-8). There 
are several versions of the chief offender’s name (Boase, Register, I, 116). 
“Indeed the higher authorities themselves had sometimes to yield 
to the claims of the Church. In June 1505 Warham withdrew from the 
Court of Star Chamber a small case relating to certain windows in Peck- 
water Inn, in which the Prior of St. Frideswide’s was concerned, and invited 
the Chancellor and the Warden of New College to settle it. (See Reg. C, 
e229.)

at Shotover and hunting the King’s deer, who lived in unlicensed 
lodgings in the town, and who begged abroad without a license. 
There was still need for stringent rules against interrupting 
Masters at their studies, against throwing pebbles and removing 
desks, against ringing St. Mary’s bell without permission, against 
damaging meadows and cutting down trees. There was still, in 
spite of pacts to the contrary, sharp quarrelling between North 
and South. Rowdy “‘legists’’ went out to break the Northern 
Proctor’s doors and windows. A pitched battle took place in the 
High Street, in which the Principal of one Hall was unpleasantly 
conspicuous and the Principal of another was killed. The old 
order might be slowly passing, but the time-honoured methods of 
disorder remained. 
Yet even where antiquity was strongest, a new world was 
beginning to unfold. There were Oxford influences, it seems, 
among the men of letters gathered round the early Tudors. 
John Skelton owed more perhaps to Cambridge than to Oxford, 
but he claimed a laurel wreath from both.? The success of his 
poems in an age of easy morals condoned his notorious failure as 
a parish priest. Pope, it is true, condemned him as “ beastly.” 
Puttenham in an earlier generation found him both ridiculous and 
tude. But with all his irregularities, his fierce sardonic humour, 
and the grossness and buffoonery mingled in his verse, Skelton 
had flashes of a higher spirit, as kindlier critics from Erasmus to 
Coleridge have allowed. There may have been honesty if not 
discretion in his satirical attacks upon the Church, in the shafts 
which flew even beyond the ‘“ cankered cardinal” and found a 
target in the King. Henry Bradshaw, a Chester monk, who 
wrote a poetical life of St. Werburgh * more conspicuous for piety 
than for poetry, was reputed a student of Gloucester College. 
Stephen Hawes passed apparently from Oxford to be a groom of 
the chambers to Henry VII, and used his University education 
to treat ‘‘ of love so clerkly and so well.” His allegory, “ The 
Passetyme of Pleasure,” tells how Graunde Amoure, the hero, 
taught by the seven daughters of Doctrine—the Trivium and 
Quadrivium in poetical attire—faced and conquered many perils 
1 Scholars begging without license from the University were subjected 
by Henry VIII’s legislation to punishment as ‘‘ stronge beggers.”” (See 
Shadwell’s Enactments in Parliament, I, 100-1, on 22 Hen. VIII, cap. xii.) 
2 He speaks of Cambridge as his ‘alma parens.” For his life and 
writings, see Dyce’s edition of his Works, Warton’s History of English 
Poetry (Sect. xxxiii), the Cambridge Hist. of Eng. Lit. (III, 56-82, where

to win the affections of la Bel Pucel. The poem, which Wynkyn 
de Worde printed in 1509, has a place of its own between Chaucer 
and Spenser, between the Canterbury Tales and the Faery Queen. 
Its six thousand lines claim boldly to cover “ the knowledge of 
the Seven Sciences and the Course of Man’s Life in this Worlde.”’ + 
Towards the end they sustain the reader with a familiar couplet : 
‘For though the day be never so long, 
At last the belles ringeth to evensong.”’ 
Alexander Barclay may or may not have been at Oxford.2 He 
was certainly a priest at Ottery St. Mary, where he produced 
his famous ‘‘ Ship of Fools,” and he afterwards became an Ely 
monk. Barclay knew Morton and admired Colet: ‘‘this man,” 
he wrote of Colet, ‘“‘ hath won some soules.” Lord Berners, whom 
tradition associates with Balliol, rendered a famous Chronicle 
into English which gave it a new and lasting splendour, and his 
versions of the great romances of chivalry took their place beside 
his version of Froissart. 
Other writers, whom it is still more difficult to connect with 
Oxford, carried on the study of history in the Tudor age. Blind 
Bernard André of Toulouse wrote annals of Henry VII and enjoyed 
the patronage of Bishop Fox.? Robert Fabyan, a rich citizen of 
London, produced an indifferent chronicle which broke occasionally 
into indifferent verse. Polydore Vergil of Urbino, for many years 
Archdeacon of Wells, taught English chroniclers to endeavour to 
distinguish evidence from myth, and has claims to be considered 
the first \critical writer of English history. He is accused of 
borrowing books too freely from Duke Humphrey’s Library. And 
he is said, when Wolsey’s displeasure led to his imprisonment, to 
have secured the University’s interest in his behalf. These men 
all helped to make a new literary tradition, and the great printers 
gave them a publicity unknown before. Caxton was himself a

probably a Scotchman. The “‘ Ship of Fools ” was largely a translation 
of Sebastian Brant’s “‘ Narrenschiff ’’; see the large edition by T. H. 
Jamieson. Sir A. Ward sums up in D.N.B. all the material facts of 
Barclay’s life.

says Speed, ‘‘ not unworthy to be vouched.” See Gairdner’s Preface to 
the History of Andreas in the Rolls Series, and Busch (England under the

translator and a lover of romances.1_ Wynkyn of Worth,? who 
succeeded to Caxton’s house at Westminster and to Caxton’s 
reputation, began to print books not for rich men only but for 
everyone who realised what printing meant. And Richard 
Pynson, also a foreigner by extraction, who became in due course 
printer to the King, easily surpassed Wynkyn in the quality of 
his work.? 
The clerks of Oxford could not be indifferent to the power and 
the productions of the Press. But in the University the love of 
letters took a larger purpose and a nobler tone. Grocyn is the 
first figure who emerges there clearly as a leader of the Classical 
Revival. He was a boy at Winchester. He was a Fellow of New 
College in 1467, where the Warden, Chaundler, could appreciate 
his gifts. He, no doubt, knew Vitelli. He acted as tutor to 
Warham. He learned Greek, he may even have taught it, in 
these early years. He was Reader in Theology at Magdalen in 
1483, when Richard III paid his visit to the College. Eight or 
nine years later, he was occupying rooms at Exeter. In 1488 he 
betook himself to Italy, like other eager and ambitious students 
of the day, and spent two years there, principally at Florence, 
drinking deeply of the scholarship he found. Linacre, it seems, 
was there before him. William Latimer and William Lily followed 
in his steps.® Aldus, the great Venetian printer, praised Grocyn’s 
universal learning. The Greek lectures, which he delivered on 
his return to Oxford, showed, one may well believe, the serious, 
practical bent which English churchmen were to give to the 
Renaissance. They brought the New Learning for the first time 
into intimate connection with English academic life. John Colet 
was fired by Grocyn’s example to set out for Italy to study in his 
turn. Erasmus, arriving later still in Oxford, recognised Grocyn

Books; A Century of the English Book Trade ; Printers, Stationers, etc., of

Hist. of Eng. Lit. (II, Ch. xiii), Wood has notices of Barclay, Berners, 
_ Bradshaw, Fabyan, Hawes and Skelton in the first volume of his Athene 
(ed. Bliss). 
«“Tpse Grocinus . . . nonne primum in Anglia Greece lingue rudi- 
menta didicit ?’”’ wrote Erasmus to William Latimer in 1517 (Allen, 
Evasmi Epistola, II, 486). 
5 The dates of these journeys are not quite certain. If Linacre and 
Latimer became Fellows of All Souls in 1484 and 1489 respectively, and 
if Lily entered Magdalen in 1486, it seems unlikely that they were all in 
Italy with Grocyn. Prof. Burrows (Collectanea, II, 319-50) gives the 
fullest account of Grocyn’s career. But Mr. Allen (I, 273, n.) gives the 
facts most accurately. See also Mr. Allen’s note on Linacre and Latimer 
in Italy in the Eng. Hist. Rev. for July 1903. Linacre may have remained 
in Italy continuously for several years.  
-P-A-G-E-477
  416 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
as ‘“‘a mine of knowledge,” as “ the patron and preceptor of us 
all.” Grocyn was more conservative in some ways than his 
companions. He never abandoned the Schoolmen. He set 
Aristotle above Plato, the master of learning above the master of 
myths! But he was hailed as a leader by the younger gener- 
ation. More found him, in Colet’s absence, the master of his 
life. After the end of the century he was constantly in London 
and often preaching by Colet’s invitation at St. Paul’s. He held 
in turn many benefices and appointments. His friends knew how 
generously he used the income which they brought. ‘“‘ We might 
well wish,” wrote Erasmus, who had had his differences with 
Grocyn, “ that faculties like his should not be subject to death or 
to old age.’’* But for all his critical ability, for all his scholar- 
ship and authority and humour, Grocyn, it seems, wrote little, 
though he wrote a Ciceronian style, and practically none of his 
writings have survived.® 
Thomas Linacre was Grocyn’s executor and life-long friend. 
His love of letters was even more remarkable, his learning even 
wider. He came from Canterbury to Oxford. He was one of 
the first Fellows of All Souls to learn Greek. He studied in 
Bologna, Florence, Rome and Venice. He took his medical degree 
at Padua. Tradition says that Lorenzo de Medici allowed him 
to share the studies of his sons, and that Pope Leo X never forgot 
his fellow-pupil. Another story tells how, on leaving Italy, the 
grateful English student built on the summit of the Alpine pass 
a rough stone altar to the land where he had learned so much. 
Oxford soon recognised Linacre’s accomplishments, his fine 
character, his devotion to knowledge. Erasmus thought him 
“as deep and acute a thinker” as any he had met, and that, 
although Linacre once advised him to put up with being poor. 
Linacre’s scholarship was admired even more than his science. 
But he too turned the New Learning to practical account. He 
not only revived classical medicine. He was probably a tutor to 
Prince Arthur. He had a share in teaching or in stimulating 
More. He wrote a Latin grammar for Colet’s school, which the 
Dean unhappily did not approve of. He wrote another later for 
the Princess Mary, which had a happier fate. In 1509 he was

% Grocyn’s criticism of the Pseudo-Dionysius shows his acumen. But 
the inventory of his books, made by Linacre and found in Merton College 
Library, does not show any marked originality, The Fathers are there, 
and the Schoolmen, and several Latin classics. The list is not a complete 
list, but the Greek books in it are very few. (See Collectanea, II, 319-24.)

made one of the King’s physicians. His patients included, besides 
his friends, the leaders in the world of letters, statesmen like 
Wolsey, Warham and Fox. He had the chief share in founding 
the College of Physicians, and its first meetings were held at his 
house. He left funds to establish three Lecturerships in Medicine, 
two at Oxford and one at Cambridge, which, against his intentions, 
became College sinecures.1_ His medical writings, on Galen 
especially, were valuable and important, more valuable than the 
originals, said Erasmus, in his whole-hearted way. Yet even 
Linacre was not too scientific to believe that rings blessed by 
Henry VIII might save the wearer from convulsions.?_ He planned 
a translation of Aristotle. He pored over philosophy and 
grammar. He had a fastidious literary taste. He was paid for 
his professional work by ecclesiastical preferments. In his last 
years he was admitted to priest’s Orders. Serious scholarship and 
clerkly learning proved in the end the strongest passions of his 
life.* 
Other Oxford scholars were conspicuous among the contem- 
poraries of Linacre and Grocyn. Bishop Tunstall, an honourable 
figure among Tudor Churchmen, belongs more properly to Cam- 
bridge, though he is said to have been at Oxford and perhaps at 
Balliol first. But William Latimer’s connection with Oxford was 
more close. Like Linacre, he went from All Souls to study in 
Italy, and became one of “ the lights of learning’’ in his day. 
He had a hand in Linacre’s and Grocyn’s translations. Erasmus 
sought his help with his Greek Testament—“ I adjure you in the 
name of Letters, sweetest Latimer ”’ —and praised his integrity 
of life. He is said to have been tutor to Reginald Pole. He 
declined an invitation—rarely offered to an Oxford tutor—to 
teach the Chancellor of Cambridge Greek. He held two country 
livings but remained faithful to All Souls. In spite of his accom- 
plishments he left no published works behind. William Lily, 
Grocyn’s godson, went up to Oxford a few years after Colet, and 
passed on from Magdalen to travel in the East. He visited 
as the Progymnasmaia Grammatices vulgaria, but is not identical with it. 
The latter is apparently an improved edition of the grammar which Colet 
rejected. Linacre wrote also a more elaborate work on the eight parts of 
speech, De Emendata Structura Latini Sermonis Libri Sex, which occupied 
him to the end of his life.

Jerusalem. He stayed in Rhodes. He sojourned in Italy. He 
came home to teach in England, and to join More in translating 
Greek epigrams into Latin elegiacs. Colet secured him as the 
first Master of St. Paul’s. There, in co-operation with Erasmus, 
he produced the Latin grammar which proved the foundation of 
his fame. His Song on Manners—puerum nil nisi pura decent— 
found its way into other publications and has found an anony- 
mous translator since : 
“Come child that art, to learn inclin’d, 
Imprint these sayings, on thy mind.”? 
But Lily was killed prematurely by an operation against which 
his friend Linacre had advised in vain. 
Richard Pace belongs to a later generation: some would 
connect him with Oxford and with Queen’s.?_ It is more certain 
that he studied in Pavia and other famous Italian cities, and 
learned to know Erasmus during his stay abroad. He was in 
Rome with Cardinal Bainbridge, an old Provost of Queen’s, when 
the Cardinal was assassinated in 1514. He returned with recom- 
mendations to Wolsey which soon made him a personage in the 
English Court. He became Secretary to the King and a busy 
diplomatist. He exerted himself to make Henry Emperor and 
Wolsey Pope. Preferments flowed in upon him, Colet’s Deanery 
and apparently two other Deaneries as well. He became Reader 
in Greek at Cambridge. He was a powerful friend of the New 
Learning. He was warmly praised by Erasmus as ‘‘ the most 
loving and honest of men.” Life at Court might be splendid 
misery, as that brilliant scholar said. But Henry’s Court, on the 
same authority, was a very museum of knowledge, and the only

Erasmus stands apart, watching his English friends with keen 
appreciation, the close and dear companion of the choicest spirits 
of the age. More has a place of his own in English history. But 
Colet was in a special sense the leader of the Oxford movement 
for reform. Erasmus after all was only a passing visitor at

Cato’s Moral Precepts (1700) now in the British Museum. Lily of course 
figures in the early pages of Wood’s Athene (vol. I, ed. Bliss), with Grocyn, 
Linacre, Colet, More, Pace and other contemporaries. For the history 
of Lily’s Latin Grammar, see Foster Watson (English Grammar Schools to 
1660, 243 sq.).

old Provost of Queen’s. Pace says that Langton sent him to Pavia to 
study, but gives no hint of Oxford (De Fructu, 27). Dr. Magrath is 
inclined to claim Pace as a Queen’s student (The Queen’s College, I, 154).

THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW AGE 419 
Oxford. More had but a brief share of Oxford education. Colet, 
like Grocyn, Linacre and Latimer, had more enduring ties with 
Oxford life. He was born, it seems, about the end of 1466.1 
Savonarola was fourteen years older. Macchiavelli was three 
years younger, Luther and Raphael seventeen. The son of a 
Lord Mayor of London, the sole survivor, tradition says, of two and 
twenty children, John Colet inherited a large fortune. He went 
to Oxford, as a Commoner, it has been thought, of Magdalen, 
about 1483.2. His relatives—on his mother’s side he had great 
connections *—procured for him early a number of benefices, 
including the rich living of Stepney. But Colet cared for study 
more than wealth. He read philosophy. He excelled in mathe- 
matics. He had an astonishing memory.‘ He “devoured” 
Cicero. He dived into Plato and Plotinus. After some ten 
years at Oxford the call of the New Learning drew him abroad, 
and we do not know exactly where in Italy he spent his time. 
But we know that in March 1493 he became a member of the 
confraternity which Innocent III had established in con- 
nection with the Hospital founded on the site of the old 
Schola Anglorum in Rome.’ We know from Erasmus that he 
devoted himself to the sacred writers, that he studied Origen 
and Cyprian, Ambrose and Jerome. We know that he drank in 
the teaching of Pico and Ficino.6 We can hardly doubt that he 
2 One version of the inscription on his monument runs “‘ Vixit annos 
53. . . . Obiitanno 1519 ” (Lupton’s Life of Colet, 237-8). Erasmus, who 
was probably born in October 1466—though his monument at Rotterdam 
says 1467 (Seebohm, Oxford Reformers, 95, n.)—speaks of Colet as being 
two or three months his junior (Lives of Vitrier and Colet, ed. Lupton, 23). 
3 Wood says (Athene, I, 22) that “‘ one or more of his sirname ”’ were 
at Magdalen. But Dr. Bloxam found no trace of John Colet in the College 
Registers (Lupton’s Life, 27, n.). He may have lived in rooms and 
belonged to no College. It may even be that some other College has a 
claim which it will yet make good. 
* His mother was a sister of Sir John Knevet, who married first a 
daughter of Lord Grey of Ruthyn and secondly a daughter of Humphrey 
Stafford, Duke of Buckingham (Lupton, 13). ee 
‘His commentary on Dionysius seems to have been written from 
memory. Seealso Wirtzung (General Practise of Physicke, ed. 1617, p. 120). 
*See Cardinal Gasquet’s History of the Venerable English College, 
Rome (24). This suggests that Colet’s journey to Italy was earlier than 
Mr. Seebohm and perhaps even Mr. Lupton thought. Pole, Bainbridge 
and Pace are all said to have acted as Wardens of the English Hospice 
in Rome, which entertained many well-known Englishmen, and sheltered 
English Romanists in Elizabethan days (Ib. 38-54). 
* Pico della Mirandola and Politian died in 1494. Colet was strongly 
influenced by the writings of Marsilio Ficino, the veteran leader of the 
Neo-Platonists of Florence, who translated Plato, Plotinus and Dionysius, 
and who left an unfinished commentary on the Romans, a copy of which is 
now in the British Museum (Harl. MS. 4695). On Savonarola’s influence 
over Pico and Ficino see Seebohm (Chaps. I and II).

    420 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
visited Florence and sat under the pulpit of Savonarola. At 
any rate he brought back to England something of the spirit 
of that extraordinary man. He returned more than ever a 
theologian and philosopher, rating the early Fathers far above 
the Schoolmen,’ strangely impressed with the mystical writings 
which a long-established literary imposture attributed to 
Dionysius the Areopagite, the convert of St. Paul,? and still 
more impressed with the need of bringing all the knowledge 
and the powers at his disposal to purify the doctrine and the 
practice of the Church. But to Colet the interpretation of 
Scripture was still the chief use to which knowledge could be 
put. In 1496 he was back in Oxford. Next year he was lecturing 
in Latin on St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans, free public lectures 
to which the whole world of the University went.? 
Colet proved to be a remarkable speaker, original both in 
method and in style. To Erasmus his discourse seemed like a 
limpid fountain, ‘‘ flowing out of the abundance of the heart.” 
He was not a great scholar. His Greek, it seems, was always 
elementary. He was still struggling with it as a beginner in the 
last years of his life.‘ At Oxford he lectured on the Vulgate, not 
on the Greek text. He was not perhaps a very keen critic, or 
he would not have believed in the authenticity of Dionysius the 
Areopagite, which Grocyn was afterwards forced to disavow. But 
he was profoundly versed in Latin, then the ordinary instrument 
of learning. He was a man of wide reading, of deep knowledge, 
and of a fearless piety which went deeper still. His message to 
the clerks of Oxford was not the message of the Schoolmen, but 
something more practical and easier to understand. For the 
scholastic hair-splitting and torturing of texts Colet substituted 
a free exposition of his author’s meaning. He wanted to know 
what St. Paul thought, what manner of man he really was. He 
1 Colet certainly disapproved of Aquinas and the Schoolmen, but there 
is little ground for thinking that he disapproved of Augustine. See Allen 
(Eras. Epist, I, 268) and Lupton (Vitrier and Colet, 22). 
2See Lupton’s edition of Colet’s Two Treatises on the Hierarchies of 
Dionysius, a Platonist philosopher who long passed under that name, the 
article on Dionysius Pseudo-Areopagite in Murray’s Dictionary of Christian 
Biography, and Bishop Westcott’s article in the Contemporary Review 
for May 1867. 
3 MSS. of these Lectures are preserved at Cambridge, in the libraries 
of the University, of Corpus Christi and of Emmanuel. Colet went on to 
lecture on the First Epistle to the Corinthians, on the theories of Dionysius 
and on the Sacraments of the Church. I do not think there is any ground 
for the suggestion that these Lectures at Oxford were irregular or contrary 
to rule. I am of course constantly indebted to Mr. Lupton’s writings 
on the subject. 
«This seems clear from the statements of More, Erasmus and Colet 
himself. (Brewer, Letts. and Papers, II, 1588, 2941, and Nichols, Ep. of 
Evasmus, II, 287 and 393.)
-P-A-G-E-482
  
  THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW AGE 421 
did not fear criticism. He did not insist on the Bible’s verbal 
inspiration. He was willing to believe that Moses in his account 
of the Creation accommodated himself to the understanding of 
the people “after the manner of a popular poet.”? He was 
not afraid of exposing abuses—the failings of the clergy, the 
scandals of the ecclesiastical Courts. ‘‘O Priests! O Priesthood! 
O the detestable boldness of wicked men.”’ He that professed 
Christ should be pure, inwardly washed and white and shining. 
Religion lay not in rites or ceremonies. Sin was the only enemy. 
Nothing conquered evil but good. The true Church of Christ was 
as a city set upon a hill, breathing the “‘ vital air of the Spirit of 
God.” And men, journeying daily towards it, were made clean 
by the divine fire, made luminous by the divine illumination, 
made perfect by the crowning love of God in Christ in heaven.? 
Colet’s appeal to Oxford was no new one. It was the old 
voice of medizval faith and self-surrender. But it was infused 
with a new fearlessness of comment and inquiry, a new impati- 
ence of sophistications, a new intolerance of abuse. And it was 
spoken through the mouth of Oxford to the educated world. 
His influence on the best minds round him was supreme. 
Erasmus, newly arrived in England and charmed by all he saw 
—a delicious climate even in December, a society of intelligent 
and learned men, and maids or nymphs divinely beautiful who 
greeted every voyager with a kiss—found at first that he had 
lost little by not going to Italy instead. At Oxford, in the 
autumn of 1499, he listened to Colet as he would have listened 
to Plato. He met him at a famous dinner given, it seems, by 
Colet, where over their wine they discussed in Latin the story 
of Cain. 
“Colet was more than equal to us all. He seemed to rage with 
a sacred fury. There was something about him sublime and august. 
His voice took another tone, his eyes another look. His face and his 
figure grew larger. There breathed on him a spirit divine.’’* 
Before long Erasmus knew Colet better and drew a very win- 
ning picture of him. Others might dwell on the Dean’s reserve, 
1 See the Letters to Radulphus, translated by Mr. Lupton, who, howevers 
substitutes ‘some ” for ‘‘a.’’ Parts of these Letters seem to have been 
suggested to Colet by Pico’s Hepiaplus on the Creation. 
? The fine passage from the Lectures on the First Corinthians is quoted 
in full by Mr. Lupton (Colet, 82-3). Compare Colet’s Two Treatises on 
Dionysius (128). 
*See the Latin in Allen (Evas. Ep. I, 268). Neither Mr. Nichols’ 
version (I, 215-16) nor Mr, Froude’s (ed. 1910, 45) has quite the same force. 
As Colet was apparently host, the dinner was probably not given at St. 
Mary’s College. It may have been at Magdalen, with Wolsey in the 
e mixed and nameless ’’ company, or at Colet’s lodgings or at an Oxford 
inn. :

on his fierce and austere gravity, on the relics of medievalism 
in his opinions, on his obstinate preference for celibacy, on his 
distrust of Humanists who were not Christians too. ‘‘ Those 
books alone ought to be read in which there is a salutary flavour 
of Christ ... Do not become readers of philosophers, com- 
panions of devils.’ 1 But Erasmus pierced to the heart of his 
friend. 
“ He was a man of genuine piety. He was not born with it. He 
was naturally hot, impetuous, and resentful—indolent, fond of pleasure 
and of women’s society—disposed to make a joke of everything. He 
told me that he had fought against his faults with study, fasting,and 
prayer, and thus his whole life was, in fact, unpolluted with the world’s 
defilements. His money he gave all to pious uses, worked incessantly, 
talked always on serious subjects to conquer his disposition to levity ; 
not but what you could see traces of the old Adam when wit was 
flying at feast or festival. He avoided large parties for this reason. 
He dined on a single dish, with a draught or two of light ale. He 
liked good wine, but abstained on principle. I never knew a man of 
sunnier nature. No one ever more enjoyed cultivated society ; but 
here too he denied himself, and was always thinking of the life to 
come,” # 
Colet’s lectures at Oxford continued for some years. But 
in 1504 he was nominated to the Deanery of St. Paul’s. In 
May 1505 he received its temporalities, and in the same year 
he inherited his father’s wealth. The Chapter at East-minster 
—the old name contrasted it with Westminster—was demoral- 
ised and corrupt. It offered a fine field for reform. The Cathe- 
dral itself, a vast structure in the heart of London, with a spire 
that rivalled the loftiness of Strasburg’s and a length that far 
exceeded the length at Milan or Cologne, was as busy as a 
crowded thoroughfare, the scene of half the traffic, begging and 
gossip of the town. Colet laboured to introduce discipline and 
order. He recalled men to their duties whether popular or not. 
Plain in his dress* and frugal in his habits, he set the example 
of simplicity of life. He cut down lavish hospitality. He con- 
demned the worship of images. He objected to preachers read- 
ing their sermons; unhappily his Diocesan could do nothing

*T quote from Mr. Froude’s brilliant summary of this well-known letter 
(ed. 1910, 106). But Mr. Lupton’s translation is fuller and closer (Vitrier 
and Colet, 30-2). For the original see the Leyden edition of the Letters 
(1706, Ep. ccccxxxv) or the London edition (1642, Book XV, Lett. 14). 
Erasmus dwelt on Colet’s intellect rather than his sunny nature, and he 
suggested a touch of parsimony ; he could never understand what economy 
meant, But like Mr. Froude he was a great artist with a vivid pen. I 
have to thank Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co. for permission to quote 
Mr. Froude’s versions. 
* He never would wear the scarlet robes in which he is depicted in 
a fine window in Christ Church Hall to-day (Vitrier and Colet, 26).

else. He preached constantly in English, to great congregations, 
and it was long since such preaching had been heard at St. 
Paul’s. From Oxford the voice of Wycliffe seemed to speak 
again. He could not forgive the luxury and worldliness of 
churchmen, the rush for wealth, the quarrels over tithes and 
offerings, the piling up of benefices—there may have been a 
touch of conscience there. Avarice and arrogance in the clergy 
were blacker sins than a hundred concubines. He who is chief, 
let him be the servant of all. Wolsey’s ears must have tingled, 
if he came to hear. ‘All corruptnes, all the decaye of the 
churche, all the offences of the worlde’”’ came from the covet- 
ousness of priests. 
Colet has been credited with “‘ a particular dislike of Bishops,” 
and some Bishops did not conceal their disapproval of him. The 
Bishop of London especially was of the old Oxford school—“ a 
superstitious and impracticable Scotist.” 1 He appealed against 
Colet to Warham and the King. But the Archbishop supported 
the Dean. Colet was accused, quite truly, of preaching against 
war: and Henry, on the brink of a campaign, sent for him, 
talked with him, and finally pledged him as a friend. “ Let 
everyone have his own Doctor. This man is the Doctor for 
me.” Colet’s great sermon preached before Convocation in 1512 
has been called the overture to the Reformation.2) He was no 
Protestant. Had he lived till the storm broke over England, 
he would have been found, one cannot help thinking, at More’s 
side. But he admitted privately, Erasmus tells us, that many 
things were generally taught which he did not believe. And for 
the reform of ecclesiastical abuses he pleaded as tenaciously 
as Luther himself. In the famous pilgrimage which Colet and 
Erasmus made to Canterbury in 1514,3 the Dean could not con- 
ceal his anger at the relics produced for adoration and at the 
treasures accumulated by the celebrated shrine. There was a 
vein of Puritanism in him which contemporary prelates found 
it hard to understand. The grave faults of the system round 
him weighed upon his spirit. His health grew worse. The 
sweating sickness attacked him again and again. He was still 
able to visit Oxford and to dine at Exeter with Grocyn. But 
in September 1519 after a brief illness the end came. “I know 
that it is well with him,’’ wrote Erasmus, broken-hearted. ‘‘ He 
has been taken from this wicked and troublesome world. . . . 
1 But Bishop Fitzjames had been a well-loved Warden of Merton, 
and was a more distinguished man than Erasmus allowed. 
2 This {sermon {is given in full in Appendix C of Mr. Lupton’s 
Life. 
* It is generally agreed that ‘‘ Gratianus Pullus ” in Erasmus’ sketch 
is only a disguise for Colet (Seebohm, 288-9, n.).
-P-A-G-E-485
  424 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
If my writings are of any avail, I will not suffer the memory 
of such a man to die.” 
Colet left few works, but under the shadow of his own 
Cathedral he left an enduring monument behind. He became 
a pioneer of middle-class education. He delighted in the purity 
and simplicity of children, as he would fain have delighted in 
the purity and simplicity of the Church. He would give his 
scholars a Christian education, good manners and good litera- 
ture, both Latin and Greek; and it did not greatly trouble 
him that the Bishop of London could not understand the neces- 
sity for Greek. Over the Master’s chair he set the figure of the 
Child Jesus. Above it was the injunction ‘‘ Hear Ye Him.” 
And “‘thryse in the day prostrate”’ the children had to repeat 
the prayers enjoined. The School was large, twice the size of 
Winchester or Eton. The curious number of a hundred and 
fifty-three scholars may have been suggested by the number of 
feast days and Saints’ days which made holidays or half-holi- 
days in the year. All nationalities were admitted, but the 
School was specially meant for London boys. Hours were long, 
both winter and summer, from seven to eleven and one to five. 
The charge was only fourpence, on admission, which went to 
pay for keeping the School clean.t A large endowment was 
settled upon it. By a happy stroke Colet made the Mercers’ 
Company its rulers. He induced William Lily to be its first 
Master. He invited Lily and Linacre and Erasmus to help him 
with books for his boys. And he wrote a grammar for them 
himself,? with a touching and familiar preface. “I pray you, 
all little babies, all little children, learn gladly from this little 
treatise. ... And lift up your little white hands for me, which 
prayeth for you to God.” # 
John Colet was still at Oxford when Thomas More came 
up, straight from Archbishop Morton’s household, a merry and 
1 The Statutes of the School are printed by Mr. Lupton in his Life of Coles 
(App. A), from the original MS. at Mercer’s Hall. Mr. Lupton’s second 
chapter has an interesting account of London schools in Colet’s day, and 
the foundation of St. Paul’s is fully treated in Chap. IX, though some of 
the views expressed there have not been universally accepted. 
2 Colet’s Zditio or accidence was first printed in 1527. But for its 
early history, and for the contributions made to it by Lily and Erasmus, 
see Mr. Lupton’s article on Lily in the D.N.B., and Mr. F. Watson’s 
English Grammar Schools to 1660 (Ch. XV). 
Mr. Lupton’s Life and his other writings upon Colet have replaced 
Samuel Knight’s Life (1724) as the first authority on the subject. Sir 
S. Lee has a valuable article, with a careful note on authorities, in the 
D.N.B., and Mr. Seebohm’s Oxford Reformers had no small share in restor- 
ing Colet to his proper rank in the history of his time.

  THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW AGE 425 
lovable boy. But Colet was soon to start on his travels, and 
More left Oxford before he returned. It was in London, no 
doubt, that he saw him oftenest and knew him best. For his 
early love of letters More, it seems, was indebted to Linacre 
and Grocyn. To Linacre especially he owed his knowledge of 
Greek. His great-grandson has said that he belonged to Canter- 
bury College, but his stay at Oxford in any case was brief.? 
We are told that his father, a successful lawyer, grudged him 
his Oxford training and kept him short of funds, that he dis- 
approved of the boy’s devotion to Greek letters and philosophy, 
and that after a year or two he brought him back to London 
and plunged him into his preparation for the Bar. But More left 
behind him in the University a strong impression of ability and 
charm, and he carried away from it all that was best in the 
spirit of the place. Oxford friends gathered round him in Lon- 
don. He wrote omnivorously. He had a genius for languages.® 
He found time not for law only but for verses, history, epigrams, 
theology. He met Erasmus, perhaps at Lord Mountjoy’s, per- 
haps at Sir Henry Colet’s, in 1499. He fell more and more 
under the influence of John Colet, in whose strength and ear- 
nestness he found support. While Colet was lecturing on St. 
Paul at Oxford, More was poring over Pico della Mirandola,‘ or 
lecturing on Augustine’s De Civitate Dei in Grocyn’s London 
church. He knew the world and its delights. But a piety 
almost as austere as Colet’s drove him for a time to fasts and 
prayers. He dreamed of becoming a Franciscan friar. And 
even when he put these thoughts behind him, fell in love per- 
haps and married,* flung himself into a great professional career, 
1 Of fourteen or fifteen. Mr. Allen (Evas. Epist. I, 265-6) inclines to 
accept Mr. Nichols’ suggestion that More was born in February 1477 
and not in February 1478. See the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries 
(March 1897, 321-7) which to some extent supersede Mr. Seebohm’s 
Appendix B. More went up, it seems, in 1492. But the University 
Registers are missing between 1463 and 1505. 
4 Probably less than two years (Hutton, Siy Thomas More, 17). Wood 
(Athena, ed. Bliss, I, 79 sq.) clings to the tradition that More was a member 
of St. Mary Hall, where he is said at any rate to have occupied a room. 
The Life and Death of Sir Thomas Moore (sic), written probably by 
Cresacre More, Sir Thomas’ great-grandson, is the authority for the 
statement about Canterbury College. (See J. Hunter’s edition of this 
book in 1828.) Hoddesdon, writing some twenty years later, in 1652, 
repeats the statement (Hist. of Sir Thos. Move, 3). In the records of 
Canterbury College in the Chapter Library at Canterbury I have found 
no proof. 
3 See Pace’s testimony, quoted in Bridgett’s Life (12). 
“ More translated Pico’s Life and Works, and there is little doubt that 
they greatly influenced his mind. 
* That is the explanation of Erasmus. More’s life as a young man was 
not blameless (Allen, Age of Evasmus, 205).
-P-A-G-E-487
426 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
became a brilliantly successful lawyer, ‘‘ beloved of Cardinals ” 
and a companion of the King, proved himself not only a most 
capable adviser, but the most witty and agreeable courtier of 
the day, More kept unsoiled the eager faith, the zest for know- 
ledge, the deep belief in all things simple, pure and true, which, 
lit with his inextinguishable humour, won the hearts of his 
friends and the admiration of mankind. 
More never lost his love of Oxford. He was appointed 
Steward of the University.1 The Masters wrote to him to 
lament the decline of their numbers and the decay of their 
Schools. Wolsey proposed to refer to him questions in dispute 
between University and town. On Wolsey’s fall More tried to 
save the Cardinal’s College from destruction. When a narrow- 
minded priest, perhaps a clerk of Oxford, wrote to warn him 
against the heresies of Erasmus, More replied with energy and 
scorn. The best of mankind had been accused of heresy. 
Jerome had said worse things of monks than Erasmus. The 
Vicar of Christ himself had approved of Erasmus’ work. ‘‘ You 
complain of the study of Greek and Hebrew. You say it leads 
to the neglect of Latin. Was not the New Testament written 
in Greek? Did not the early Fathers write in Greek?” Eras- 
mus had spent more years in studying Scripture than his hasty 
critic had lived in the world. In short “ Erasmus is the dearest — 
friend I have.’ When a Court preacher ventured to denounce 
Greek studies from the pulpit, More was called on to answer 
him in the presence of the King, and he so trounced the ignor- 
ant offender that the latter begged for forgiveness on his knees. 
And when the reaction against the New Learning at Oxford pro- 
duced a clique of so-called Trojans to resist the spread of Greek, 
and one of them gave vent to his prejudices in a sermon, More, 
who was with the King at Abingdon, promptly took the chal- 
lenge up. He wrote a striking letter to the University, reproving 
a folly which was growing into madness, and which threatened 
to destroy all liberal education. What right, he asked, had the 
Oxford preacher to denounce Latin, of which he knew little, 
Science, of which he knew less, and Greek, of which he knew 
nothing at all? The finest writings on all subjects, divinity in- 
cluded, were in Greek. The object of Oxford and its great foun- 
dations was to support students in the acquirement of knowledge, 
not merely theological or scholastical instruction, but useful 
learning of whatever nature it might be.’

-P-A-G-E-488
  THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW AGE 427 
More was happiest perhaps when pleading thus for tolerance 
and learning. But his tragedy, if it be a tragedy, was to be 
played out on a larger stage. The exquisite picture of his home 
in London has been drawn by Erasmus as only he could draw. 
The dream picture of his undiscovered country was the first 
application to English politics of the new spirit of social reform. 
Only More perhaps, with his wistful, humorous fancy, could have 
conceived in the early sixteenth century a commonwealth founded 
on equality and freedom, a State indifferent to private property? 
and contemptuous of wealth, with a universal rule of work and 
leisure, a high regard for justice and for education, a large in- 
dulgence of opinion, a frank delight in fools. The even more 
celebrated picture of his superb tranquillity in face of death is 
among the unforgotten scenes of English history. “ Son Roper, 
I thank the Lord the field is won.” More was not unconscious of 
weakness and temptation. He was not by temperament invari- 
ably serene. His practice was not always equal to his theory, 
his voice was not always the voice of wisdom or restraint.? His 
tender playfulness, his mocking wit, his rich and many-sided 
nature concealed, it may be, struggles which left their mark. 
Yet no more lovable or noble Englishman passed from fifteenth- 
century Oxford into a changing world, and none, as that strange 
world’s shadows gathered round him, kept the shining dreams of 
boyhood more undimmed. 
More had in no common measure genius and strength com- 
bined. Colet had more strength than genius. But in Erasmus, 
with less strength of nature, genius was supreme. In words he 
was the greatest artist of his age. In scholarship he had few 
equals. In range of sympathies and understanding he perhaps 
had none. He steps in and out of the life of Oxford, in and out 
of the lives of his famous Oxford friends, with a brilliant rest- 
lessness, a fearless intimacy, very characteristic of the man. All 
Europe is his stage, all educated Christendom his audience. 
Oxford can only claim to have won, as he passed through it, his 
sensitive affection and respect. But Erasmus, more than any 
other single figure, embodied the Renaissance as it was interpreted 
by the scholars of the North. He was their literary leader. No 
1 Colet had guardedly approved of the ideal of a community of goods. 
(See Lupton’s Life, 74.) 
2 More’s controversial writings were little above the level of the age, 
and his attitude towards heretics is not easy to reconcile with the ideals 
of the Utopia. Of the early lives of More those by Roper, Stapleton 
(Ives Thoma) and Cresacre More are the most important. Dean Hutton’s 
and Father Bridgett’s are among the best modern lives. Sir S, Lee’s 
article in D.N.B. is full of useful references and information. For human

428 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Humanist of his generation had such repute. And none loved 
the world and its humours more intensely than the eager, vivid, 
eloquent Dutchman, whose wit charmed every one except the 
monks, and whose seriousness could touch the deepest chords in 
natures essentially religious like John Colet’s and Thomas More’s. 
It was in 1499 that Erasmus first arrived in England. His 
fame at that time was still to be made. But he had already 
been schooled in hardship and experience, and had learned to 
hate the vice and gluttony, the ignorance and impostures, which 
he connected with the monastic life. He had discovered his own 
powers and weakness and ambition. He had passed, not un- 
scathed, through the University of Paris. He had found patrons 
and pupils to fill his ever-empty purse. He had made friends 
wherever men or women could appreciate his charm. Conspicu- 
ous among his pupils in Paris was Lord Mountjoy, who brought 
him to England and introduced him everywhere. Erasmus found 
it all delightful. He was at home in every kind of society, even 
in the hunting field. His English perhaps was the English of a 
Dutchman, but his Latin talk was irresistible. Young Thomas 
More became an intimate friend. One day More took him off to 
the Palace at Eltham, and presented him without warning to 
Prince Henry, then a beautiful and gracious boy of nine. At 
Oxford, where Prior Charnock welcomed him at St. Mary’s Col- 
lege, he soon became familiar with the leading scholars of the 
time. He wrote with enthusiasm about them all, Grocyn and 
Linacre, Charnock and Colet. He had come to Oxford, he told 
Colet, ‘“‘ to spend a month or two with men like you.”? And 
Colet’s strength and power impressed him most. Colet, it seemed 
to him, had taken arms against the dull and sordid and omniscient, 
who were to be his own enemies through life. Colet was trying 
to bring back the Christianity of the Apostles. He was serving 
the cause of education as well as the interests of the faith. It 
was Colet whose destructive criticism perhaps swept away the 
Dutch scholar’s lingering respect for the Schoolmen, Colet, who 
did not hesitate to censure even Aquinas for the presumption with 
which he “defined everything in that rash and overweening 
1 The date of Erasmus’ first visit has often been given as 1497 or 1498, 
and Mr. Seebohm states his reasons (94, n.) for choosing 1498. But it is 
now established that Erasmus first came over with Lord Mountjoy in 
1499, and spent two or three months at Oxford in the autumn of that 
year. (See Nichols, Ep. of Evasmus, I, 200 and 224-5.) Erasmus seems 
to have been the guest of Sir William Saye, Mountjoy’s father-in-law, both 
in London and at Greenwich. Mr. Nichols’ volume The Hall of Lawford 
Hall contains a good deal of information about Mountjoy and his relations 
with Erasmus. For Erasmus’ early life see Allen (Evas. Ep. I, Appendix II).

manner.”! It was Colet who urged him to stay on at Oxford, 
to take up the exposition of the Bible, and to help him in his new 
Crusade. But though Erasmus could appreciate such labours, 
he was not yet prepared to work upon those lines.2. He had not, 
he told Colet, knowledge or strength enough. ‘ With what face 
can I teach what I myself have not learned?’ He was charmed 
with England, but the call of Italy, of freedom, of adventure, 
was too strong. In January 1500, laden with presents of money, 
which the Custom-house at Dover seized, he left England for 
the Continent again. His old comrades in Paris welcomed him 
warmly. ‘‘ We rejoice to have recovered what was part of our 
souls.” If Erasmus had lost his money, the friends whom he had 
made in England were worth, he was reminded, far more to him 
than gold. 
Five years of hard work followed, rendered all the harder by 
poverty and uncertain health. Erasmus read everything, from 
Lucian to Duns Scotus. He studied Origen and Jerome. He 
devoted himself to the Bible. Above all, he ‘‘ buried ” himself 
in Greek. He also dipped into Hebrew, but desisted, “ knowing 
that one man’s life and genius are not enough for too many 
things at a time.” * He could not raise funds to get to Italy. 
“TI am as poor as a rat,” he writes, “‘ but I must and I will be 
free.” And meanwhile he was gradually making himself a name. 
His Adagia, a collection of classical proverbs and quotations, 
at once brought him reputation, though the first incomplete edi- 
tion was fullof blunders. His Enchiridion, or Pocket Dagger 
of a Christian Soldier, was written, he told Colet, to teach the 
art of piety as opposed to a faith of formularies and rites. His 
edition of Lorenzo’s Valla’s Annotations on the New Testament ® 
was a preparation for his greatest work. In 1506, when he was 
again in England,* his credit as a scholar was established. He 
could translate Euripides into Latin and offer his versions to 
1 Vitrier and Colet (ed. Lupton, 33). 
* See Nichols (I, 221-2). It is hardly necessary to point out that the 
three volumes of Mr. Nichols’ translations of the letters of Erasmus, and 
Mr. P. S. Allen’s great edition of the Latin text, have, with their notes, to 
some extent superseded the older lives by Knight, Jortin and Drummond, 
valuable as these are.

famous for his independent views.

stay at Cambridge—Fisher probably took him down there—see Allen

Lambeth in 1501 or 1502, is probably mistaken,

Archbishop Warham.1_ Warham became a generous patron. No 
more impenitent borrower than Erasmus ever lived. He visited 
Cambridge and obtained his Grace for a Doctor’s degree. But 
next year English pupils were forthcoming, anxious to travel to 
Italy with him, and in their company he set out for his long- 
wished-for goal at last.? 
Erasmus, it is to be feared, soon tired of his travelling com- 
panions. But in Italy he found a royal welcome. It was less 
easy for him to find a settled resting-place. It was never easy 
to secure a settled income. He received his Doctor’s degree at 
Turin. He visited Bologna, Florence, Padua, Rome.* He saw 
face to face a Pope of the Renaissance rejoicing in the cruel 
wickedness of war. He stayed with Aldus, the great printer, at 
Venice,‘ and his Adagia in a new edition swelled into a portly 
folio there. But the hopes raised by the new reign in England 
called him back. More was the new King’s friend. Linacre was 
his physician. Colet was soon to win his admiration and respect. 
Mountjoy wrote with enthusiasm of Henry’s love for men of 
learning, of his “almost divine character,” of a new age dawning, 
a laughing heaven and an exulting earth. Henry himself sum- 
moned his dear Erasmus to find rest from all anxieties in Eng- 
land. With their joint resources and endeavours they might 
nobly defend the Gospel of Christ. No wonder that the wander- 
ing scholar was attracted to “this new auspicious star.” In 
July 1509 Erasmus travelled Northwards. Within a few months 
he was back in England, and writing the Praise of Folly in 
'  More’s London house.® 
He had no reason to complain of his reception. His friends 
gathered round him. Work and pay were forthcoming. More 
and Grocyn were hospitable. Warham and Fisher were ready to 
help. In 1511 Erasmus was again at Cambridge, teaching Greek.® 
__. 1In January, 1506 (Allen, I, 417). Their acquaintance seems to have 
begun then. (See Erasmus, Catalogus lucubrationum, ed. 1523, pp. 6-7.) 
2 Erasmus says he was not in charge of these young gentlemen, but 
only superintendent of their studies (Nichols, I, 416). 
* Also Venice, Ferrara, Siena and Naples. (See Nichols, I, 451-7.) 
«Erasmus stayed in the house where both Aldus and his father-in-law 
lived (Allen, I, 443, Nichols, I, 437). The household consisted of some 
thirty-three persons. The house still stands, it seems, on one of the smaller 
canals near the Rialto. (See art. on Erasmus in Italy, Eng. Hist. Review, 
vol. 10, 1895, and De Nolhac, Evasme en Italie, 33.)

Queens’ College, where quarters were assigned to him,} still re- 
calls the charm of medieval England. But he seems to have 
found strangely little pleasure in the quiet beauty of the place. 
He disliked the climate. He disliked the beer. Hesawno chance 
of profit. He lived “ the life of a snail.’’ He travelled to Lon- 
don whenever he could. He made occasional pilgrimages. He 
longed for the society of More and Colet. And he worked hard 
at his great literary projects, especially at his New Testament 
and his edition of Jerome. But in 1513 he was evidently making 
up his mind to run away. He had already repented of coming 
back to England.* He had discovered that an island was at best 
a place of banishment. He was sighing for the sunshine, the 
libraries, the generous Cardinals of Rome. The King was kind, 
but full of war and business. The “‘ mountains of gold’”’ he had 
dreamed of had never appeared. In 1514, taking his Jerome and 
his New Testament with him, he set out to visit Froben’s famous 
press, and though he never ceased to wander, Basle was from 
that time forward his most constant resting-place and home.* 
In the years that succeeded, Erasmus became the most re- 
nowned scholar in Europe. And he became more than ever the 
advocate of reasonable reform. But the world about him was 
splitting into factions which he could not join. He could only 
use his ever-growing influence for reconciliation, unity and peace. 
He had not, it is true, the fearlessness of Luther. He had not 
“strength for martyrdom.’ He dreaded revolution. But he 
dreaded also lest he should ‘‘ be found fighting against the Spirit 
of God.” He would gladly have made war on ignorance and 
abuses, without breaking the fabric of the medieval Church. 
Both sides lost patience with him. On both the fiercer spirits 
had their way. ‘ My popularity,” he told the Pope in 1523, “‘ is 
turned to hatred. Once I was Prince of Letters, Star of Germany, 
High Priest of Learning. The note is altered now.’ In such a 
time of ‘‘ monstrous tempest’ the pure faith which he had 
pleaded for went down. “Christ,” he sighs, ‘‘ has been sleeping 
so far.” Theologians had forgotten to call upon Him. “ Christ 
will not wake till we call to Him in sincerity of heart.’ § 
course fills a much larger place than Oxford in this ‘‘ Oxford Reformer’s ” 
life. 
1 Mr. Nichols thinks he occupied part of what was then the Master’s 
Lodging (II, 26). 
2 But it seems that his translation of most of the New Testament was 
made some years before this (Allen, II, 182). 
? Yet he was soon writing to Pace that no land in the world was like 
England, and in none would he better love to spend his days (Froude, 
Erasmus, 199).

432 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
Fate did not mean Erasmus to become an Englishman. He 
was a graft, as he said, not a native here. He never spent more 
than a few months in Oxford. But he shared the dreams of the 
Oxford Reformers, and his books must have profoundly influ- 
enced Oxford men. The Praise of Folly—Folly in her cap and 
bells surveying the weaknesses of every order of mankind, Princes 
and soldiers, scholars and statesmen, grammarians, philosophers, 
theologians, monks—was written at More’s elbow, and breathed 
all More’s spirit of irony and fun. Editions poured from the 
press. Bishops and Cardinals chuckled over it. Holbein illus- 
trated the text. Milton found it the talk of Cambridge a century 
after its author’s death.1_ The Novum Instrumentum, a far greater 
and graver project, raised the same unhesitating standard of re- 
volt, and dwelt, as Colet had dwelt, on the need of a reformed 
and practical Christianity, against pagans and sceptics on the one 
side, against formalists, dogmatists, impostors on the other. But 
now Erasmus was speaking to the world of scholars. His New 
Testament introduced alike to clerk and to layman the Greek 
text of the Epistles and Gospels, accompanied by a Latin trans- 
lation better than any made before, and illustrated by a vivid — 
and invaluable commentary to emphasise the lessons taught. — 
Let all men study in the words of Scripture the life and work of © 
Christ. Philosophers, Platonists, Pythagoreans fought for their 
own masters. Why should not Christians know and fight for 
theirs? The philosophy of Christ could be learned far more 
easily than the philosophy of Aristotle, and He at any rate was 
a teacher from heaven. But no-one could study the Gospels 
without contrasting with them the practice of the Church. Celi- 
bacy, chastity, simplicity of doctrine, the faults of prelates, the 
hypocrisies of monks, the abuses which had crept into ritual and 
dogma, the worldliness and superstition which were demoralising 
faith, these were the texts on which the fearless editor enlarged. 
And once again he seized the opportunity to denounce the most 
orthodox studies of the Universities of Europe in words which 
no critics of the Schoolmen could forget.   
“‘We have been disputing for ages whether the grace by which 
God loves us and the grace by which we love God are one and the 
same grace. We dispute how the Father differs from the Son and 
both from the Holy Ghost, whether it be a difference of fact or a 
difference of relation, and how three can be ong when neither of the 
three is the other. . . . Entire lives have been wasted on these 
speculations, and men quarrel and curse and come to blows about 
them. ....... 
1 Of the Morie Encomium there are many editions and translations. 
See also Froude (Erasmus, 137-42), Seebohm (193-204), Drummond 
(Evasmus, I, Ch. VII, etc.). The well-known letter from Erasmus to 
Martin Dorp on the subject is given in Mr, Allen’s second volume (90-114).
-P-A-G-E-494
  THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW AGE 433 
“The schoolmen have been arguing for generations whether 
the proposition that Christ exists from eternity is correctly stated ; 
whether He is compounded of two natures or consists of two natures ; 
whether He is conflatus, or commixtus, or conglutinatus, or co-aug- 
mentatus, or geminatus, or copulatus. The present dpinion is that 
none of these participles are right, and we are to have a new word, 
unitus, which still is to explain nothing. If they are asked if the 
human nature is united to the Divine, they say it is a pious opinion. 
If asked whether the Divine Nature is united to the human, they 
hesitate and will not affirm. And all this stuff, of which we know 
nothing and are not required to know anything, they treat as the 
citadel of our faith,’’? 
Young Oxford, in revolt against the Schoolmen, must have 
delighted in outspoken comments such as these. Erasmus’ New 
Testament made him a leader of reform. It marked a turning- 
point in the religious revolution. More rejoiced at its astonishing 
success. The Pope with strange facility approved it. Scores of 
thousands of copies were sold in France alone. ‘“‘ It contributed 
more,” a great student has said, ‘“‘ to the liberation of the human 
mind from the thraldom of the medieval clergy than all the up- 
roar and rage of Luther’s many pamphlets.” But it made no 
inconsiderable uproar on its own account. Conservatives were 
shocked that any scholar should try to improve upon the Vulgate. 
Many of them had forgotten, and did not wish to be reminded, 
that the original was written in Greek. Erasmus had no blind 
respect for verbal inspiration. He pointed out errors and re- 
jected spurious texts. He was accused of a want of reverence, 
of correcting the Holy Ghost. He was not readily forgiven for 
wishing to make the Bible too familiar. Why, asked the obscur- 
antists, need the Gospels and Epistles be available for Scots and 
Irishmen, for Saracens and Turks? Why should Erasmus want 
to hear the husbandman sing them over the plough, and the 
weaver hum them to the tune of his shuttle? But, as the oppo- 
sition gathered strength and the friends of the old order rallied 
to attack him, Erasmus only developed his teaching and amplified 
1 For the Latin notes on First Timothy, I, 6, see vol. VI of the Leyden 
edition of the Works (926-8). I have quoted from Mr. Froude’s vigorous 
version (Evasmus, 131-2), but I have ventured in one place to alter 
“neither ” into “none.” Mr. Allen (II, 164 sq. and 181 sq.) has two 
valuable notes on Erasmus’ New Testament. He gives the preface which 
introduces the ‘“‘ annotatiuncule,’’ and the letter to Pope Leo in February 
1516, introducing the book. Erasmus’ work on it probably began at 
least as early as 1505. Colet lent him two Latin MSS. from the library of 
St. Paul’s. See also among others the letters to Budé and to Bullock 
(tr. by Nichols, II, 280-4 and 324-32). The paraphrases on the separate 
books of the New Testament, a free version in a popular form, which 
Erasmus began to issue in 1517, were specially successful in England. 
A complete English translation of them was printed in 1548 (Allen, III, 
136-7). Mr. Drummond (Erasmus, I, Ch. XI) gives a useful account of 
the New Testament and the St. Jerome,

histheme. The St. Jerome, which Froben also published in 1516— 
the Notes to the New Testament had been full of quotations from 
St. Jerome —proved that the first among Latin theologians was 
upon his side. “ To confess the truth, Jerome is our only theo- 
logical author, whom we can put in the same rank with those of 
Greece.” ? Leo X accepted the dedication of this great edition, 
and recommended the author for a Bishopric. And though 
Erasmus was never to be Cardinal or prelate—he might with 
little effort at accommodation have been both—his writings never 
ceased to charm his age. In the Oxford book-shops, if John 
Dorne’s day-book be a fair criterion, they were more in demand 
than Duns or Aquinas, they filled more space than Aristotle him- 
self. The Colloquies, which began to be published in 15109, set 
the seal upon his reputation. They showed him at his greatest 
as an artist rich in observation and experience of mankind. No . 
man had drawn more vivid or delightful pictures of the world 
in which he moved. To that world the Colloquies revealed him 
more clearly than ever as one of the rarest spirits of his time, 
unsurpassed in humour, tolerance, understanding, unfailing in his 
keen and laughing sympathy with every side of life, unsparing 
in his scorn of falsehood, undaunted in his tenderness for all 
things holy and innocent and true. He continued to write 
through the storms that beat around him. To the last he pleaded 
strongly for the simple, human faith he loved. And though the 
rulers and the disputants of his day refused to listen, generations 
after him his larger temper has prevailed. 
Magdalen had given a lead to the New Learning, and the 
Masters of the School beside it fully maintained the reputation 
of the College. The School became the home of a movement for 
new methods in teaching Latin grammar. Donatus, who had 
been the instructor of St. Jerome, Dolensis,* who had paraphrased 
Priscian in the days of Coeur de Lion, were going out of fashion, 
none too soon. The famous manual of Donatus on the eight 
parts of speech had been characteristically converted into a 
treatise on morals, which connected the declension of the noun 
1The authorised Latin version of the Bible was substantially St. 
Jerome’s work. Erasmus’ Greek Testament had doubtless many faults 
of scholarship. It was, as he said, “‘ hurried out headlong ”’ (Nichols, II, 
251). But it was a great advance on the standards of his age. 
2 Nichols (II, 179). See also Mr. Allen’s note (II, 210—11). 
® About 1520. See Collectanea (I, 71 sq., and II, 453 sq.). It has 
been calculated that Dorne sold in his shop opposite St. Mary’s 2,383 books 
in the year, of which about 250 were by Erasmus (Bodl. Quart. Record, 
I, 176).

with the declension of the soul from God. The rhyming hexa- 
meters of Alexander De Villa Dei had been overloaded with 
generations of glosses, and to mockers like Skelton the venerable 
grammarian seemed only ‘‘ a gander of Menander’s pole.” John 
Anwykyll, John Stanbridge and John Holt, all masters in Magdalen 
College School, ranked among the first of the grammar reformers. 
Anwykyll’s Compendium was printed by the early Oxford Press. 
Stanbridge’s grammars had a wide circulation and became models 
for many a class-room. Holt’s Lac Puerorum or Mylke for 
Children was honourably known before the fifteenth century 
closed. Stanbridge and Holt alike brought simpler methods into 
a field where they had long been needed. Lily, Linacre, Erasmus 
did not disdain to follow the same path. And Robert Whittington, 
a pupil of Stanbridge,? carried on the new educational tradition, 
though his needless assumption of the title of ‘“‘ Protovates 
Angliz ” offended scholars compared with whom he was reckoned 
“but a crackling thorn.’? 
But a far more conspicuous personage than these was for a 
brief space Master of Magdalen College School, before he became 
the magnificent patron of School and College and University alike. 
Tradition, which cannot confidently settle the date of Wolsey’s 
birth, declares that he went up to Oxford very early and became 
a Bachelor of Arts at fifteen. 
“Degree of school I had 
And Bachelor was, and I a little lad.’’? 
He undoubtedly became Fellow and Bursar of his College.* 
Skelton belittled his Latin, and laughed at his knowledge of 
“ quadrivials and trivials.’”’ But a greater poet than Skelton has 
borne witness to his scholarship, and Wolsey must surely have 
had some reputation as a student if he succeeded Anwykyll and 
Stanbridge as Master of the College School. He valued and 
encouraged learning afterwards, from Latin grammar up to the 
1 Whittington’s books on grammar figure as largely as Stanbridge’s in 
John Dorne’s list (Collectanea, I, 172-5). 
2On these early grammarians see Lupton (Colet, 21-5), Bloxam 
(Register of Magdalen, III, 7 sq.), who quotes and supplements Wood, 
Chandler (Waynflete, 253-4), and F. Watson (Eng. Gram. Schools to 1660, 
ch. xiv). 
3 So sang Thomas Churchyard in Elizabethan days. (See The Tragedy 
of Cardinal Wolsey, printed at the end of Gollancz’s edition of Cavendish’s 
Life, 266.) Fiddes (Life, 4) says that Wolsey took his B.A. at fourteen, 
but does not prove it. 
4 Junior Bursar in 1498-9, and Senior Bursar in 1499-1500, says Dr. 
Macray (Register of Magdalen, I, 29-30). He supplicated for the degrees 
of B.D, and D.D. in 1510 (Reg. of Oxf. Univ. I, 67). See also Bloxam 
(Register, III, 24 sq.). Dr. Bloxam thinks that Wolsey resigned his

widest studies of his day. In 1500 he received a living from Lord 
Dorset, and with that the flow of preferments began. A few 
years later he was the King’s chaplain, deep in Bishop Fox’s 
confidence, and a rising man at Court. Promotions and benefices 
followed quickly. In 1509 Wolsey became Dean of Lincoln and 
Almoner to the new King. Five years later he was Bishop of 
Lincoln and Archbishop of York. Before the end of 1515 he was 
Chancellor and Cardinal, and ruler, men said, both of King and 
of kingdom. “Finally,” writes Tyndale, he “ became what he 
would, even porter of heaven. ... And ever as he grew in 
promotions and dignity, so gathered he unto him of the most 
subtle-witted, and of them that were drunk in the desire of honour, 
most like unto himself.’’ 1_ The Masters of Oxford were quick to 
recognise his eminence. They turned from Warham to the rising 
sun. They conferred degrees upon him. They hailed him as 
their Pontifex, their spokesman, their Maecenas. For a personage 
so powerful, “ adored as a Deity,” even the title of Majesty did 
not seem to be too great.?_ And it may be added that the compli- 
ments which reached the Cardinal from Cambridge were at least 
equally emphatic and profuse. 
Wolsey was immersed in policy and business. But he found 
time to play a large part in Oxford life. ‘‘ Sweet as summer ”’ 
to those who sought him, he was quick to respond to the Uni- 
versity’s appeals. He visited Oxford in 1518, coming over from 
Abingdon in company with the Queen. He was entertained at 
Magdalen. He attended and addressed a great meeting of 
Masters. He undertook the revision of the Statutes. He was 
invited, a little later, to nominate Proctors. And he supplied 
the University with new and formidable weapons to carry on its 
old struggle with the town.‘ The Charter, which he obtained 
from the King in 1523, raised the authority of the Chancellor and 
his officials to a height not touched before. , It gave them sole 
jurisdiction in all suits affecting persons entitléd to the privileges 
of the University in all parts of the Kingdom. They were to 
have their own gaol for offenders. They received grants of fines 
1 See Tyndale’s Practice of Prelates (Parker Soc., 310 and 308). Wolsey 
enjoyed at different times, among other preferments, the Deaneries of 
Lincoln, Hereford, York and St. Stephen’s, Westminster and the 
Bishoprics of Tournai, Lincoln, Bath and Wells, Dirham and Winchester, 
to say nothing of the Archbishopric of York and the great Abbey of 
St. Albans.

and treasure trove and confiscated goods. They were secured 
against writs of error and vexatious appeals to the Royal Courts. 
Above all—and here the sting lay—they and their scholars and 
the great class of privileged persons gathered round them were 
given unrestricted rights of trading in Oxford, with power to 
form corporations of traders and to make regulations for them, 
in complete disregard of the representatives of the town.? 
But Wolsey’s high-handed generosity had gone too far. The 
Oxford burgesses bitterly resented this attack upon their rights 
and customs, and there was a curious delay in putting the Charter 
into force.2 Slumbering enmities woke to life again. The Uni- 
versity officials were accused of abusing their authority. The 
townsmen petitioned against the Charter, and refused arbitration 
on the subject, even by Sir Thomas More. One Mayor, William 
Fleming, declined to swear to observe the University liberties 
or to recognise the service on St. Scholastica’s day. Another, 
Michael Heath, a brewer, protested against oaths to the University 
which interfered with his duty to the King. He went further 
and brought down excommunication on his head.? Citizens set 
to work “to bark and cry out and clamour,’” to thwart the 
University administration in every way they could. The Guild- 
hall doors were shut against University officials. The Commissary 
was accused of “‘ exstorcyon’’ in levying charges on salmon and 
herrings. The University retorted. Leading traders in the town 
were discommoned and their shops put out of bounds. Each side 
continued for long to make charges against the other. But the 
townsmen were determined not to give in. The Masters them- 
1¥For the terms of this famous Charter see Med. Arch. (I, 255-72), 
Registrum privilegiorum (Oxf., 1770, 53-75) and Lyte (427). 
2 For the town’s point of view see Turner’s Records of the City of 
Oxford (passim, but especially vii sq., 33-41, 62-6, 72-130). Wood 
(Ann. II.) gives an account of the matter under the years 1523 and 1528, 
which suggests that the full extent of the new privileges was not realised 
by the University till 1528. But I cannot think with Sir H. M. Lyte (428) 
that they remained unknown to the University all that time. Wood 
states (Ann. II, 23) that the Charter was conveyed to Oxford by the 
Cardinal’s Commissaries, three prominent University men, under the 
year 1523. It is clear from Twyne’s extracts published in the City 
Records that the town’s protests began in that year. And it seems that 
owing to these protests the operation of the Charter was postponed. In 
July 1528 it was apparently revived, possibly enlarged, and published 
in Congregation. In February 1529 it was enforced by the King’s Writ. 
And from that date the struggle was waged with vigour—in spite of 
attempts to settle it, notably in January 1533—+till the final arbitration 
in December 1542. Wood’s account is not always clear (e.g. Ann. II, 73). 
In Reg. KK (f. 31>) there is a curious passage describing the discovery of 
Wolsey’s Charter apparently—then almost forgotten—by the University 
Scribe in the Royal Treasury in 1566. (See also Wood, Amn. II, 35.)

the town which nine times elected him as Mayor.

    438 A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD 
selves seem to have realised that the Charter claimed more than 
they could hope to enforce. After some twenty years of contro- 
versy they agreed to arbitration and even petitioned for its 
repeal. Wolsey’s Charter was dropped. But a generation later 
the Elizabethan Act incorporating the Universities took occasion 
to revive and to confirm it. And a vague and illogical saving 
clause guaranteeing the rights and liberties of the city did not 
allay the suspicion or prevent the troubles which ensued. 
Wolsey’s schemes for the benefit of Oxford had something 
of the generous grandeur which stamped his schemes of policy 
abroad. ‘‘ Nothing mean,” says Fuller, ‘ could enter into this 
man’s mind,” though the dictum perhaps may not apply to the 
Cardinal’s methods of accumulating wealth. He proposed to 
codify the University’s Statutes, to revise its studies, to endow 
Lecturers in new subjects, to combine the suppression of monas- 
teries which had served their purpose with large projects for 
improving education. The Statutes badly needed revision. The 
long-accumulated stores of ordinances and traditions were often 
contradictory and confused. The Chancellor, Warham, was all 
in favour of reducing them to order: some, he admitted, had 
fallen into disuse, and some into entire oblivion.2? But when the 
University proposed to give Wolsey power to cancel and re-issue 
Statutes at discretion, Warham not unnaturally demurred. He 
pointed out that the details of University regulations could only 
be properly dealt with by people who knew them and who lived 
on the spot. He suggested that the Cardinal should be invited 
first to indicate what changes and improvements he desired. The 
Masters assured their Chancellor that his advice was all-important, 
and promptly disregarded everything he said. The laws and cus- 
toms of the University were placed unreservedly at Wolsey’s 
disposal, to deal with as he pleased. But’ his premature fall or 
his overwhelming occupations prevented the proposed reforms 
from taking shape.*® 
Whatever may have been Wolsey’s claims to scholarship, there 
is no doubt where his sympathies in education lay. The brilliant 
challenge issued to the Schoolmen by scholars like More and Colet 
‘and Erasmus had produced a strong reaction. The lost causes 
of Oxford have never lacked the power to fight. Greek was a 
passion with the friends of the New Learning. To resist it, a

which Dr. Poole has printed (Lect. on University Archives, 40-1), there is 
a note of various documents in the Archives bearing on this famous 
controversy.

  THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW AGE 439 
new academic party of Trojans arose, who “ raged in every pul- 
pit against Greek, Latin and Hebrew,” and would burn every 
Terence or Virgil, “‘ though it should cost them their lives.’’+ 
Orthodox churchmen, who were far from being fanatics, still 
viewed Greek with some suspicion. ‘‘ The ignorant party,” as 
Wood called them, had behind them-all the most cherished 
traditions of the past. If Greek has ruled too long in the Schools 
of Oxford, it had at any rate a hard struggle to gain admission 
there. Even More might have hesitated to administer his sharp 
rebuke to its enemies in the University unless he had felt certain 
of the great Cardinal’s support. Every man educated at Oxford, 
he told them, and not only the resident Masters, had a right to 
an opinion on the subject. The Primate would not have the new 
studies meddled with. The Cardinal of York would not endure 
it. The King’s Majesty, more learned and more pious than any 
English monarch had ever been before, would not look on passively 
while “worthless blockheads’’ interrupted the course of sound 
instruction in the oldest University in the realm.? 
Wolsey, however, did not confine himself to rebukes. He 
mourned over the ‘‘ penury’’ of teachers at Oxford. He invited 
thither students from all quarters—Cambridge men among them, 
who brought dangerous Lutheran ideas. New Lecturers were 
appointed. Race and country were not to count in their selection : 
there was a fine cosmopolitan spirit among the scholars of the 
Renaissance : all the Cardinal cared for was their power to teach. 
Thomas Lupset, one of Colet’s boys at St. Paul’s, returned, fresh 
from his studies at Paris, to lecture to crowded audiences at 
Oxford, to expound Linacre’s version of ‘‘ Proclus his Sphere.” 
The University overflowed in acknowledgments to Wolsey. 
“‘ We place it in the Number of your immortal Benefits, that your 
exuberant Goodness towards the common Advancement of Learning, 
hath vouchsafed to send Lupset among us.’’? 
Nicholas Kratzer, the mathematician immortalised by Holbein, 
was drawn from Bavaria. Juan Luis Vives, a brilliant young 
Spaniard, came over from the Netherlands, to deplore the “ windy, 
dense, and damp” climate of Oxford, and to prove himself a 
pioneer in education. Students welcomed this “ mellifluous

Pace, Erasmus, Linacre and Pole, and seems to have taught Thomas 
Winter, Wolsey’s natural son. _Thomas Starkey, who lectured during the 
same period at Magdalen, was named as Proctor by Wolsey in 1522.

Doctor’? as one of the most interesting teachers of the day. 
Queen Catharine encouraged him to write on the education of 
women, and till the ill-starred advent of Anne Boleyn he enjoyed 
great popularity at Court. More marvelled at his mastery of 
knowledge. Erasmus prophesied that Vives’ fame would over- 
shadow his own. 
Wolsey certainly knew how to choose his men. He hoped 
to effect reforms in education at both Universities alike. For 
Oxford he planned a number of Professorships, and new Schools 
for the Professors to lecture in. His first proposals, it may be, 
were not carried through. But in connection with Cardinal 
College six Public Professors were arranged for, three, unmarried, 
to lecture on Theology, Philosophy and Canon Law, three, who 
might be married, to lecture on Medicine, the Humanities and 
Civil Law. Their selection was to be entrusted to a Committee 
on which not only representatives of Cardinal College but officials 
of the University sat. It is worth noting that most of the Heads 
of Colleges were members of this Board?: the Oxford Heads of 
Houses were gradually coming into their own. The Professor of 
Philosophy would naturally be concerned chiefly with Aristotle 
and Plato. But the Professor of Theology was to lecture on the 
text of the Old and New Testaments as well as the Questiones 
of Duns Scotus. And the lectures on the Humanities were 
to include not only Cicero and Quintilian, but Lucian, Homer, 
Hesiod, Aristophanes, Euripides, Sophocles and Pindar. Cardinal 
College with its magnificent endowments was to be only part of 
1See Vives On Education and the other volumes which Dr. Foster 
‘Watson has devoted to translating and editing Vives’ works. See also 
Allen (III, 507-8) and Lyte (438-40). Vives’ Dialogues were long popular 
at Westminster, Eton and elsewhere (Watson’s Tudor School-boy Life). 
2 Fiddes (Life of Wolsey, 197 sq.), following Wood, gives a list of seven 
new Chairs, which must be received with caution; Bloxam (Reg. of 
Magdalen, III, 70-3) gives an account of Thomas Brynknell, whom Wood 
names as Wolsey’s first Divinity Lecturer. It is not easy to be sure of 
the relation which Wolséy’s original plan for University Professorships 
bore to the six Public Professors arranged for in the Statutes of Cardinal 
College (ed. 1853, 122 sq.)—each of whom declared himself to be “in 
publicum collegii vulgo vocati the Cardinal College et Academie Oxoniensis 
in N. professorem electus ”—and to the three Public Readers or Professors 
arranged for in the Statutes of Corpus. It is clear, I think, that Wolsey 
latterly intended to pay his Professors out of the revenues of Christ Church. 
But it is not impossible that Corpus in early days gave some of them 
maintenance and lodging. (See later, Chap. Xi) Wolsey’s plans were, 
no doubt, modified as time passed, and Fox may haye co-operated with 
him. 
3 Statutes (Cardinal College, 124). But the list is Curious. Magdalen 
and Oriel and the Monastic Colleges are not mentioned, and Merton appears 
as “ Sancti Martini.” Merton was sometimes spelt and pronounced as 
Marton, Marten or Martin. (See Siats., Corpus, iv, and Plummer’s 
Elizabethan Oxford, 102.)

THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW AGE 44I 
a great scheme of education, linked up with grammar-schools all 
over England. The projects of Wykeham and Waynflete were to 
be far surpassed. The treasures of the old monastic houses were 
to contribute to the new ideals. Indeed Wolsey went so far in 
appropriating their resources, that Henry himself intervened with 
a “rude yet loving ’’ letter of rebuke. The proud Cardinal was 
compelled to protest that he really wanted nothing from the 
Monasteries. Indeed he would rather sell all he had than accept 
their self-sacrificing ‘‘ offers’’ in future. His conscience should 
not be spotted. Nothing should cast a doubt on his love and 
dread for God and for the King.? 
Wolsey did not live to complete his great designs. But the 
University had no reason to complain of his devotion. His 
influence must have helped the friends of progress. Only some- 
times the pace of progress threatened to be too fast. Luther’s 
theses found their way to England. Oxford theologians on 
Wolsey’s invitation were sent up to London to condemn them. 
Cambridge burned the new opinions. But among the promising 
Cambridge students whom Wolsey had drawn to his new College, 
it seems that the pestilential doctrines had already taken root. 
Tyndale, who is thought to have taken his Bachelor’s degree in 
1512,? had begun to read the Bible “ privily to certain students 
and fellows” of Magdalen. From Magdalen perhaps the fine 
infection spread. Archbishop Warham wrote in distress that 
“no small number of young and incircumspect fools’? at Oxford 
had become tainted with the new ideas. He wished to discuss 
with Wolsey the best means of quietly putting these heresies 
down.’ John Clarke, the leader of the party, a man with the 
stuff of a martyr in him, had expounded St. Paul’s Epistles in 
Cardinal College. Thomas Garret, a graduate of Magdalen, was 
selling copies of Tyndale’s New Testament and Latin treatises by 
German Reformers. He had even ventured to send them to the 
Reading monks. Students were meeting in Oxford to discuss 
them. The malcontents increased in number, and profiting by 
the example of Luther, they affixed their ‘‘libels” to church 
doors. 
Then Wolsey struck. He had not Warham’s patience. The 
authorities ordered Garret’s arrest. Anthony Dalaber, a student

Papers, IV, 1970), and Lyte (443-4).

which his family used. He took his M.A., it seems, in 1515 before going 
on to Cambridge. (See Boase, Register, I, 80.) 
3 See Ellis (Ovig. Letts., 3rd Series, I, 239-42). Sir H. M. Lyte (4509, n.) 
would date this letter not earlier than 1526 or 1527. Garret’s arrest and 
adventures took place early in 1528 (Foxe, Acts and Monuments, ed. 
Pratt, V, 829).

of St. Alban Hall, helped to smuggle him off to Dorsetshire. But 
on the third day Garret rashly returned. Cottisford, the Com- 
missary or Vice-Chancellor, seized him, and shut him up in a 
cellar in his house. During evensong the prisoner escaped. He 
made his way to Dalaber’s room, borrowed his coat and started 
for the West again. Dalaber carried the news to Cardinal College. 
There he had the pleasure of seeing Cottisford come into church 
‘as pale as ashes ”’ and draw the Dean out of the choir. Presently 
Dr. London appeared, the unpopular Warden of New College, 
“ plustering and blowing like a hungry and greedy lion seeking his 
prey.” Theauthorities in their extremity consulted an astrologer, 
regardless of the precepts of the Church. They learned that 
Garret had fled to the South-east, and his arrest near Bristol 
shortly afterwards may have enforced the futility of relying on 
the stars. Dalaber too was arrested in Oxford, sharply examined 
and set in the stocks. Under the ordeal, it seems, his courage 
failed. Dr. London, who had some kindliness underneath his 
bluster, would have been content to pack the heretics back to 
Cambridge. But Oxford under Wolsey’s instructions set to work 
to purge its own. Six members of Cardinal College, headed by 
John Clarke, were imprisoned and excommunicated, the Organist 
only being excused on the ground that ‘‘ he was but a Musitian.” 
Most of the offenders showed signs of recantation or remorse. 
They were made to march round from St. Mary’s to St. Frides- 
wide’s, carrying faggots—a disagreeable reminder—and flinging 
heretical books into a bonfire at Carfax as they passed. Clarke 
and two of his College friends died, carried off, it may be, by the 
sweating sickness.1_ But the Bishop of Lincoln had shown him- 
self implacable, and the Protestants insisted that the hardships 
of their treatment had caused the prisoners’ death. 
Clerks at Oxford were less difficult to silence than the larger 
public out of doors. Scurrilous books, as many churchmen 
thought them, were already pouring from the press. Outspoken 
comments on Church abuses were passing from mouth to mouth. 
The Wicked Mammon, The Revelation of Anti-Christ, The Sumof 
Scripture and other significant pamphlets were dreaded hardly less 
by ecclesiastical opinion than English versions of the Scriptures 
themselves. Simon Fish’s Supplication of Beggars was a vigorous 
attack on the clergy as idle thieves who made beggars of the poor.? 
1 Dalaber’s account of these occurrences is given by Foxe (V, 421 sq. 
and Appendix). See also Wood (Amn. II, 29 sq.), Lyte (459 sq.), and 
Brewer (Letts. and Papers, IV, 1761 sq.). Was the ‘‘ deep cave ” with its 
“filthy stench,” in which the prisoners languished, anything worse than 
Dr. Cottisford’s cellar? Mr. Froude’s account (History, ed. 1893, I, 
524 sq.), if not quite free from bias, is given in delightful detail. 
2 See the concluding passage of A supplicacyon for the Beggers, of which 
there is an early if not unique copy in the British Museum.
-P-A-G-E-504
THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW AGE — 443 
Sir Thomas More set to work to answer it with The Supplication 
of Souls, and condemned its author as ‘‘ the proctour of hell.” 
Henry, still the confident champion of all that was orthodox in 
Princes, summoned theologians from each University to examine 
these alarming theories. Cromwell was driven to wishing that 
Luther had never been born.! A conference, held in London in 
1530, condemned a number of dangerous propositions. Oxford 
was required to search its records for the facts in regard to its 
treatment of Wycliffe. The King showed more and more inclina- 
tion to be guided by University divines. He had discovered that 
their approval might be needed to satisfy his conscience if he 
should unhappily be driven to differ from the Pope. 
Oxford had her share in the tragedy of Wolsey, in the unlovely 
comedy of the King’s divorce. Already the last Prior of St. 
Frideswide’s had been transferred to Oseney. A new and 
magnificent College was rising on the ruins of the ancient House, 
where nuns and monks had prayed in Oxford for centuries before 
the University began. Three sides of the great quadrangle were 
progressing and in part completed. One of the lordliest Halls in 
England, with a kitchen hardly less imposing, had been built. 
The Cardinal, said the Oxford wits, had founded a College and 
finished an eating-house. Prebendaries, in Cranmer’s view, were 
good vianders if nothing more. Wolsey himself seemed as 
omnipotent as ever—when suddenly and dramatically he fell. In 
October 1529 the Great Seal was taken from him. The plunder 
of his possessions followed swiftly on his disgrace. His fine 
foundation at Ipswich was suppressed. In vain he pleaded for 
his “poor innocents.” In vain he hoped that the College at 
Oxford would escape. ‘To destroy the whole,” he wrote to 
Gardiner, “‘ it were too great pity.” For ‘‘ weeping and sorrow ” 
he could hardly write to Cromwell at all. The King was persuaded 
to promise that something should be saved from the wreck at 
Oxford. Some College there should be. But Cardinal College was 
doomed. From Henry’s caprice there could be no appeal. With 
his last words the dying Cardinal bore witness to the princely 
heart of a master who, rather than miss any part of his appetite, 
would endanger the loss of one half of his realm. 
On the rst March 1530 Henry wrote a letter to the Vice- 
Chancellor, the rulers of the Colleges and the Regents and Non- 
Regents of Oxford, asking for their opinion on the validity of his 
marriage with Queen Catharine.* They were to give their views

APPENDIX 
THE EARLY STATUTE BOOKS AND REGISTERS OF 
THE UNIVERSITY 
HE University Statutes are of course the principal authority 
| for its constitutional history. The earliest collection known 
was discovered only a few years ago by Mr. F. Madan and Mr. 
S. Gibson on two leaves of a thirteenth-century Bodleian MS. con- 
taining treatises on grammar (Bodl. MS.e Musao, 96), and was printed 
in April 1921 in the Bodleian Quarterly Record (vol. III, 117-18). It 
consists mainly of proclamations dealing with the preservation of 
the peace, and some two-thirds of its contents reappear in the official 
Statute-books (see ante, pp. 37, and 142-3). The date of the writing 
is probably not later than 1275, and the most interesting Statute in 
the little collection, requiring every Scholar to be on the roll of some 
Master, is apparently earlier than 1231. Only one, that forbidding 
cursory lectures in Canon and Civil Law at certain hours, relates en- 
tirely to studies, and the MS. is mutilated at this point. 
Apart from this early fragment the ancient Statutes are preserved 
in four Manuscripts, of which the most venerable and important is 
Registrum A, the Chancellor’s Book. The oldest portion of this 
Register is in fact a codification of the Statutes in force about the 
beginning of the fourteenth century, many of them based on very 
early customs and promulgated during the preceding years. It may 
have been written about 1325, or at any rate before 1350. Most of 
the Statutes are undated and are not easy to date from internal 
evidence. The second Register in point of time is Registrum D 
(MS. Bodl. 337), written probably about 1375, and principally com- 
piled or copied from the Chancellor’s Book. The third is Registrum 
G, the Junior Proctor’s Book, which dates from 1407, and which we 
owe to Richard Fleming, the Founder of Lincoln College, who was 
Proctor in that year. And the fourth, Registrum B, is the Senior 
Proctor’s Book, dating from 1477, which Mr. Anstey rightly criticised 
as full of blunders. Anstey did not ignore Registrum D, but he did 
not appreciate its importance, and his collection of Munimenta Aca- 
demica was based chiefly on his readings of the Chancellor’s and the 
two Proctors’ Books. 
These four early sources are supplemented by other MSS. of less 
importance and of later date. Registrum CC, now in the British 
Museum (Cott. MSS., Claudius D.8) is a transcript of that part of 0 
which is in the original hand. Registrum E is a volume of Statutes 
drawn up by George Darrell, Junior Proctor in 1604, which repre- 
sents an attempt to codify the ancient Statutes, as well as those of 
447

Edward VI, of Cardinal Pole, and of Elizabethan days. And Regis- 
trum F (or B-++) is another transcript of Statutes, taken chiefly from 
B by Thomas James, with additions by Brian Twyne. The name 
Registrum F, or Liber Epistolarum.F, is also given to the old Letter 
Book of the University, written partly in John Farley’s hand and 
often called by his name. It contains letters principally in Latin, 
from 1421 to 1509. These have been printed from the original MS. 
by Mr. Anstey under the title of Epistole Academice Oxon. A later 
Letter Book, Liber Epistolarum FF (now MS.\ Bodl. 282) runs from 
1508 to 1597. Other Letters of the University are in the Cottonian 
collection. 
To these authorities must be added the numerous volumes of 
Registers of Congregation (and of Convocationlater). These begin with 
Aa about 1448, which has special value for the light it throws on 
| academical studies and on proceedings in Congregations, and are 
| carried on by G (1505-17), H (1518-35), I (1535-63) and many others. 
Add also the many volumes of the Registers of the Chancellor’s Court ; 
Dr. Clark mentions fifty-three of these, down to 1706 (Wood’s Life, 
IV, 140-2) ; Dr. R. L. Poole gives a list of seventy-two, down to 1857, 
in Appendix II to his Lecture on the History of the Archives. These 
begin with Aaa, the Register of the Court from 1434 to 1469, of which 
Anstey has printed a considerable portion. 
The Matriculation Books, Subscription Books, and other important 
MS. authorities begin later. 
The locus classicus for the MS. authorities used by Anthony Wood, 
including those in the University Archives, is of course Dr. Clark’s 
full and valuable catalogue in vol. IV of his Life of Wood. Mr. 
Anstey’s introduction to his Munimenta Academica must be read in 
the light of more recent and exact information, of which Mr. Gibson’s 
notes—his Note in the Bodleian Quarterly Record for April 16, 1921, 
is only one example—are among the best illustrations one could have. 
But we have not long to wait for the publication of Mr. Gibson’s great 
work on the Statutes, which has been for some time passing through 
the University Press.

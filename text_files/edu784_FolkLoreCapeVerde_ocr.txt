PREFACE. 
Tuese tales and riddles were collected during the summers of 
1916 and 1917 from Portuguese Negro immigrants from the 
Cape Verde Islands. Scattered through eastern Massachusetts, 
Rhode Island and the seaports of Connecticut, there are small 
colonies of Cape Verde Islanders. In the colony at Newport, 
R.L., there are two hundred or more; and in this colony lived my 
interpreter and teacher, Gregorio Teixeira da Silva, and the 
larger number of our informants. But we made several visits 
to the colonies in Providence, Fall River, New Bedford, and the 
Cape. We also visited Nantucket. 
Mr. Silva was married to a native of Georgia, and on the Cape 
I came across another mixed marriage; but as a rule the Island 
immigrants are married to their own country-women, of whom 
there are comparatively few, or they live celibate. It is cus- 
tomary for an Island woman to take boarders — boarders, for 
the most part, from her own island or that of her husband. 
They constitute colonies within colonies, so to speak, people from 
the same island to a certain extent keeping together. It was 
such boarding-houses we were apt to visit in search of informants. 
In the houses of Fogo Islanders our welcome was always particu- 
larly cordial. Mr. Silva was from Fogo, and frequently he had 
to overcome a certain shyness in himself and in others when we 
visited the houses of other Islanders. But in Fogo houses, where 
Silva was very apt to find an old acquaintance or an acquaintance 
of an acquaintance, he was always at ease — except one day, I 
remember, on the Cape, when the Fogo greeting was over- 
warm, considerably to the embarrassment of both Silva and the 
country-woman he had not seen for the fifteen years or more he 
had been in this country. In her pleasure at seeing him, she 
started to embrace him in the Hispanic manner,— arm around 
shoulder, and cheek to cheek,— but he drew back, too Ameri- 
canized. In New Bedford, in the house of a Boa Vista man 
married to a San Nicolao woman, I met one Sunday a San Nico- 
lao friend from Newport. He had come over to see the woman, 
who was sick. Was she not, as he said, from his country? To 
be sure, the Boa Vista husband, who was working on week-days

on two eight-hour shifts (presumably in two factories) to pay 
the bills of one!doctor after another, on Sundays kept very open 
house, and visitors went out refreshed. 
Many of our acquaintances worked in factories; others were 
waiters or cooks; others, dock-hands. Mr. Silva was a laborer 
for several years in the service of the Torpedo Station. On 
Cape Cod and on the Island of Nantucket, numbers of Islanders 
are employed in the cranberry-bogs from May to November, 
and in the early autumn picking-season men throw up their 
regular jobs to go to the bogs for a few weeks to make big money. 
Before the war, passenger-steamers ran directly between New 
Bedford and the Islands; and some Islanders made a practice of 
summering in this country, and going home for the winter at the 
close of the cranberry-bog season. In: two or three of the bog- 
cabins we had some pleasant and profitable evenings; in one, 
our most signal defeat. It was on Nantucket; and we had 
driven our livery-stable hack through long stretches of sand or 
swamp, to be challenged with some suspicion when we reached 
the isolated cabin. The boss had been to the West Indies,— all 
over the world, in fact, he said,— and he was more intent on 
demonstrating his sophistication and his control over his men 
than on giving them and us a good time. He insisted that they 
knew no stories, and nobody contradicted him. It was plain 
they dared not — he could discharge at will. The next day, in 
a yard in town, one of the gang from this bog turned up, and, 
after apologizing in the characteristic friendly and charming 
manner of his people, joined in the story-telling and riddling. 
This sunny little yard and the rooms giving upon it were kept 
clean and orderly. Two Brava Island women lived here. The 
fisher-folk of Brava were among the first to come to the United 
States a half century or so ago, and Nantucket was one of their 
first stations. But even in the bog-cabins where there were no 
women, or in the rooms of the slum-houses of Providence or 
Fall River,— and some of these buildings area vile disgrace to the 
municipality,— cleanliness and neatness were characteristic. 
The cleanly personal habits and the tidy housekeeping of the 
Islanders have been preserved in spite of their American environ- 
ment. Nor have the Islanders lost as-yet their gracious Old- 
World manners — except when, as in the case of the Nantucket 
boss-chieftain, they are men of travel. The only instance of 
rudeness I personally encountered was from one of these men of
-P-A-G-E-14
Preface. xili 
the world, who, when the other men were not looking, slapped 
me on the back as we went into the room where we were to spend 
the evening a-riddling; and that familiarity was merely the 
outcome of a faulty classification, due to experience, which, 
though wide, was misleading. We no sooner fell to riddling 
than the mistake was rectified. 
Our riddling evenings were particularly agreeable and gay. 
Naturally I soon came to know the greater part of the answers to 
the riddles; and when I guessed right, the company was always 
pleased, and always more expressive of their pleasure than con- 
formed with the New England of which they seemed fortunately 
unaware, at least for the time being. Story-telling was more 
laborious, as the stories had to be told slowly in order to be 
translated and recorded. In the stories in both Portuguese 
dialect and translation the translation made on the spot served 
as notes for Mr. Silva to write the story in dialect at a later date. 
The English translations as printed are of his stories. This 
method of collecting and translating is laborious, nor is it quite 
free from the danger of literary elaboration; but the method 
seemed necessary, as neither of us could take down the stories in 
the dialect; at least, in the first summer of our work, when the 
bulk of the stories were collected. By this method, moreover, 
dialectical differences between the Islands — and they are con- 
siderable — are for the most part overlooked. The stories are 
in the Fogo dialect. A variant of Tale 8 (8 4) is given also in the 
San Vicente dialect as understood by a European Portuguese 
brought up in that island. Tales 32, 754, 90, 92, 132, were 
recorded directly by Mr. Silva‘after he had become more self-con- 
fident in the writing of dialect. Tale 133 was recorded directly by 
Mr. Antonio Soares Rosa of Fogo, and Tales 53 @ and 82 4 were 
dictated in dialect by Mr. Rosa. In 191g Mr. Silva died, our 
partnership concluding before we had finished our joint under- 
taking. With three exceptions, the stories in English only are the 
stories, therefore, that were translated at the time of recording. 
In three cases (Nos. 4, 8, and 107) the stories were told and 
recorded in English,— told by young persons of Island descent, 
but born in this country. In other cases, even when the foreign- 
born narrator spoke English better than his interpreter, I had the 
story told in dialect, as I had learned from experience that when 
the foreign-born narrator told his story in English, it suffered 
greatly from paraphrases or short cuts.
-P-A-G-E-15
xiv Preface. 
The stories are disparate in length and form. The greater 
number are European, and told probably much as they are told 
in Portugal; others are European in substance, but given an 
Island or African setting; others, again, may be entirely African. 
Needless to say, the distribution, as far as my narrators were 
concerned, bore no relation to the varying proportion of white 
race or black. The narrator most African in physical type would 
narrate unmodified European tales, and the most European ap- 
pearing would delight in the animal stories or the stories about 
Wolf (Lob’). Individuals, however, frequently had marked 
preferences about one type of story or the other. Moreover, 
there was a general appreciation, I think, that the animal stories 
were less to be identified with their Portuguese culture than the 
stories that began, let us say, with three brothers in search of 
dventure. That the stories had no place at all in American 
culture, was of course even more deeply appreciated; and often 
“an informant would say that he had not told or heard a given tale 
. for many years, not since he had been in America. 
There is, of course, considerable intercourse between Portugal 
and the Islands, although few, if any, of my informants, had 
visited Portugal. The island-born son of Mr. Silva is being edu- 
cated in Lisbon. How much communication there is with the 
African mainland I donot know. The steamers from Portugal 
stopped at the mainland, and between the Islands and mainland 
there is trade. One of my informants had relatives on the main- 
land, and had visited them for several months. Between the 
Islands there is, too, considerable intercourse. And s0 it is not 
surprising that with but three exceptions I failed to find in the 
story-telling any Island localization. The exceptions are Nos. 
14, 26, and 36. These stories, or rather variants, appear to be 
confined, as far as one can ascertain at a distance, to Fogo. 
And yet acquaintance with the people in their island homes 
might well reveal differentiations in narration that have escaped 
usin America. Differentiation between the Islanders themselves 
is notable even in this country, and I am not surprised to find one 
Captain George Roberts who sojourned in the Islands from 1722 
to 1724, reporting, quite in accordance with my own observations, 
that the people of St. Nicholas spoke the best Portuguese — the 
language in general he describes as a Mandingo dialect mixed 
with corrupt Portuguese —and were “the exactest Roman 
Catholics of any of the Islands,” and that the people of St. John’s,
-P-A-G-E-16
Preface. xv 
or, I presume, Brava, were ‘“‘the most ignorant and superstitious, 
as well as the most innocent, harmless, and friendly, of all the 
Cape de Verd Islands.” 1 
San Thiago is the capital of the Islands, and in the geographies 
the island of the capital is also called San Thiago or Santiago. 
By the Islanders this island is always called Cab’ Verde, and I 
have followed their usage. 
There is a cycle of tales about Wolf and his nephew, just as in 
the Bahamas I found a cycle about Boukee and Rabbit. If you 
ask for a story about Lob’ (Wolf) and Tobinh’ (Nephew) or for a 
story about Boukee and Rabbit, you will hear part of the respec- 
tive cycles. And yet in both cases I have hesitated to group the 
cycle tales together; for the tales are not told as a cycle, nor are 
the leading personages confined to the more characteristic tales 
of the cycle. 
In Nos. 13 and 24 there are elaborate formula-openings. Ac- 
cording to Mr. Silva, the opening of No. 24 is not uncommonly 
said — not by the narrator, but by some one in the group — just 
to start the story-telling ball a-rolling. One narrator always 
began with “Que cusa cusa,”’ the opening for riddles. As a rule, 
however, the opening is simply, ““Was a man married to a woman,” 
“Was a boy,” etc, Starting the tale with a married couple or 
with three sons is, of course, in itself formulaic. Comparatively 
detachable formula-closings are more common. Indeed, the 
offerice, the offering or /envoi, should attach to every well-told 
story. The offerice, again according to Mr. Silva, is supposed to 
refer, however slightly, to the plot of the tale, and this reference 
taxes the skill of the narrator. The conclusion of No. 77 Mr. 
Silva once cited, I remember, as a satisfactory offerice. There 
are closings, however, which are entirely irrelevant to the tale, 
and these appear to be the more numerous. “It is finished”’ may 
also close a tale. 
It is curious that the only parallels I have as yet noted to tales 
Nos. 8, 53, and 63 are found among the Apache, the Mus- 
khogean, and the Malecite Indians; and to Tale 63, among the 
Antigua Islanders in New York City.? That European folk-lore 
should reach us first through Indian or Negro is an interesting 
1 Roberts, 128, 134, 148 (see “ Bibliography and Abbreviations,” p. xvii). 
we on this connection we may note that American Negroes now and again refer to tales 
3 A Porto-Rican variant of Tale 8 has since been published, and is cited on p. 16 
(note 3).

xvi Preface. 
commentary on the value attaching to it in Europe, more particu- 
larly in the Hispanic Peninsula. 
Elision, particularly of final vowels, and elimination of distinc- 
tions of gender, number, and to a large extent of tense, constitute 
the main features of this Portuguese Negro dialect. For elided 
letters an apostrophe is used, except in the case of verbs which fail 
of conjugation. As in English Negro dialects where the same 
features occur, there is no uniformity in the practice of elision, and 
departures into the grammatical language will be made. The 
phonetic system used is the Portuguese, with a few exceptions. 
At the end of a syllable s is not pronounced sh, as in Portuguese, 
but like s in the English word “ silly;” /4 should be sounded as j, 
velho becoming ej’ (belh’). As in this word, 5 is often substi- 
tuted for ». In some cases the letters in an initial syllable be- 
ginning with a vowel are reversed and the vowel modified; escuro, 
for example, becoming sucur’. There is a tendency to transfer an 
yr into another syllable; for example, we get prodi for pobre. As in 
this word, e often becomes 7. However, Mr. Silva would use ¢ and 
i somewhat indifferently, and I was never quite sure whether the 
indifference was a matter of phonetics or of orthography. There 
was the same puzzling indifference in the use of @ and e; for 
example, rasponde might be written in one line, and responde in 
the next. 
In working out a correct orthographic system and in several 
particulars of translation I have had valuable assistance from 
Miss Matilde Bensaude. She was unable, however, to read proof, 
so that certain irregularities have been unrevised, more particu- 
larly irregularities of accent. On the other hand, in numerous 
instances variations in accent are advised, as variation in pro- 
nunciation actually occurs: for example, ca, ta, f’ra, may be pro- 
‘nounced either cd, td, f’rd, or ca, ta, f'ra. Miss Bensaude’s notes 
on textual peculiarities will be found in Part IJ, pp. vii-x.

FOLK-LORE FROM THE CAPE VERDE ISLANDS. 
Part I. 
FOLK-TALES IN ENGLISH. 
I. THE SEVEN ROBBERS.! 
Once there were two brothers; one was rich, the other was poor. 
The poor brother gave the rich brother one of his three sons to 
christen. Every day the child went to his godfather’s to get 
bread. Then he said that giving him bread every day was very 
expensive. One day his god-child came to his house to get bread. 
He took the bread; he threw it in his face; he said to him, “Do 
not come to get bread any more.” ? The poor brother got grass * 
for a living. One day he went out early for grass. He was too 
early, he sat down to wait for daybreak. He saw seven robbers 
come out of a rock. He heard them say where they were going 
to steal. One said, “I’m going to Providence;” another said, 
“Tm going to Newport;” another said, “I’m going to San Fran- 
cisco.” After they left, he went to the rock; he said, “Rock, 
open!”? He entered; he found all kinds of money on the ground. OP y ground, like grass. He had only one donkey, no sack. He took off his 
trousers, filled them with money, saddled them on his donkey; 
he went home. Next day he borrowed a donkey, making two, 
and he took with him a sack. When he came home with all this 
money, he saw he had too much money not to measure it. He

2 Variant: The poor brother comes every day to the rich brother’s house for bread. 
The rich brother goes on a journey. When the poor brother asks his sister-in-law for the 
bread, she throws it in his face, He takes it home to his wife, but will not eat it himself; 
and he is so distressed, he feels like killing himself. (Cab’ Verde; Fogo.) 
3 There are no barns in the Islands. Cattle are pastured or tethered near the house. 
After the grass has dried, people pull it up and bring in bundles of it for the tethered ani- 
mals. People are free to get grass wherever they find it. As in the tale, 2a man may be 
paid for getting it. 
4 Variants: (a) In front of the poor brother’s house rises a big hill. He goes up one 
of its two summits with the intent of suicide. As he weeps, he sees smoke rising from the

sent to borrow a quarta! from his rich brother. He measured 
the money, he buried it under the bed. Next day he went again 
with four donkeys, he sent to borrow the guarta again. Before 
this he bought food by the /i#re. His brother thought he could 
buy only by the /i#re, not by the guarta. He put some tar on the 
quarta he lent him. ‘He measured; when he sent [returned] the 
guarta, a pound of gold stuck to the bottom of the guarta. The 
rich brother found it. He went to ask his brother where he got it. 
The poor brother said to him that it was a guarta of corn which 
he bought. The rich brother answered, “No, I found a pound 
sticking to the guarta. If you don’t tell me, I’m going to denounce 
you in the city.” The poor brother told him how he saw the 
robbers come out of the rock, as well as how he got the money. 
The rich brother said to him, “You must. take me there to get 
some money.”—‘‘Yes, I will take you? Yes, go, and come at 
midnight! we will go.” The man went home; but, as he was in a 
hurry to get the money, he came back at ten to crow like a rooster. 
His brother said to him, ‘“Go home! You are not a rooster. 
When it is time, J will call you.” He went; in half an hour he 
came back. His brother said, ‘It is still too early, but we will 
go.”? The rich brother took five donkeys, the other took two. 
other summit. Through the smoke appear three men. He goes and finds a hole full of 
money. He forgets about suicide, and for a week he is engaged in bringing down the 
money. (Cab’ Verde.) 
(2) There are two compadres, one rich and one poor. The poor compadre walks out one 
night, grows tired, and lies down to rest. At midnight he hears a noise. It is made by 
robbers. He is scared, and hides behind the rocks. The rocks are their home. They 
. say, “Open, rock!” The rock opens, and they go in. Then it closes up. The hidden 
man overhears all this. (San Vicente.) 
4 A quarter of an algueiri,—- a quarta being twenty quarts; an algueiri, eighty. 
2 Variants: (a) When the rich brother returns home and finds his poor brother living in 
gteat prosperity, in a new house, and with goods of all kinds, he says to him, “If you don’t 
tell me where you get all these things, I’ll kill you.” — “‘It is a secret,” says the poor 
brother; “but to keep you from killing me, I'll tell you.” — “Telling me is the only way 
to save yourself.” (Cab’ Verde.) 
(4) The rich brother sends his three sons to the poor brother’s house to find out about his 
new wealth. The poor brother gives three gold pieces to the boys. The rich brother 
accuses his poor brother of stealing. (Fogo.) 
(c) The poor compadre borrows seven donkeys from his rich compadre to carry his loads of 
money. Then he borrows a quarta. On the bottom of it the rich compadre puts glue. 
Five ¢iston stick to the measure. “My compadre has been stealing,” says the rich com- 
padre to himself; and to his poor compadre he says, “If you don’t tell me where you got 
this money, I’ll make the matter public.” 
(d) Ali Baba’s wife goes to her sister-in-law to borrow the guarta. She goes twice. The 
second time they soap the measure, and two pieces of money, twenty-dollar (pes’) pieces, 
stick,... ‘‘My brother, you are stealing,” the rich brother says to the poor brother. 
(San Nicolao.) — The narrator said he had heard the tale; but he was familiar, I subse- 
quently ascertained, with a Portuguese edition of the Arabian Nights.

They went to the same place, they sat down to wait. When it 
was time, out came the seven robbers. The poor brother counted 
them. When all seven had come out and left, he said, “Rock, 
open!” They went in, they collected the money all together. 
There was a bar of gold. The rich brother said, ‘I will take it 
with me.” The poor brother said to him, ‘‘No, don’t take it. 
It’s the only one here. They will discover it, they will miss it.” 
The rich brother took it, however; he put it into his sack. Next 
day he did not wait for his brother, he went alone with twenty 
donkeys. The robbers had not missed the gold bar. He loaded 
his donkeys, he left. The next day he took forty donkeys. 
After he got there, six robbers came out; they left one there to 
catch the man who came there to steal. He counted, “One, two, 
three, four, five, six, six; it can’t be six, it’s seven.” He counted. 
again. “It’s six, but I’m going to make it seven .— Rock, open!”’ 
He went in, he filled his sack. The robber who was inside caught 
him. He put irons on his hands and feet, he left him until the 
other robbers came. They took him, they skinned him, they 
cut him up joint by joint, they left him there! A day passed, he 
did not come home.. His wife went to the house of her brother- 
in-law. She said to him, “If you don’t go get your brother, I'll 
denounce you in the city.” He answered, “I'll go for him, but 
1 Variants: (a) When the rich brother is caught by the robber whom he has not 
counted, he says, “It’s not I stealing from you, but my brother.’ (Fogo.) 
(2) The rich compadre takes fourteen donkeys. When he loads them up with money, the 
poor compadre, who this time has taken out food only from the robbers’ place, says, “Now, 
let’s go!” — “No,” says the rich compadre. “You may stay, but I’m going,” says the 
poor compadre. “Go ahead! take my fourteen donkeys. I'll overtake you.” The poor 
compadre starts ahead with the donkeys. The robbers return, and find the rock open. 
One of them says, “I smell royal blood.” — “That can’t be, nobody here,” say the others. 
The rich compadre hides himself in a drawer. They search, and they catch him. “It 
wasn’t I who came here before, it was my compadre,” he says; but they do not understand 
him, and they beat him to death. (San Vicente.) 
(c) Ali Baba and his brother (name forgotten) go to the robbers’ rocks, taking two 
donkeys and two big sacks. “Say ‘Nac, nac!’ when you want to enter,” says Ali Baba, 
“and ‘Nic, nac!’ when you want to go out.”... On his return the night of his first ven- 
ture, the rich brother cannot sleep. Before dawn he gets up, and says to his wife, “I know 
a place where we can get money.” He goes, says to the door, “Nac, nac!” The door 
opens, he goes in, loads up, and, wishing to come out, he says, “Nic, nic!” The door 
does not open. Again he says, “Nic, nic!” The door tightens up. He shakes the door, 
crying, “Nic, nic! Nic, nic!” The door resists, The captain of the robbers arrives and 
finds him inside. He cuts him up into four quarters and hangs them on the wall. 
(San Nicolao.) 
2 Literally, “answered him.” Verbs like “answer” or “ask” or “say,” almost always 
take an object or indirect object in Mr. Silva's usage; but the locution becomes awkward 
at times in English, so in translation it will not always be rendered. Antonio Soares Rosa, 
who was called upon after Mr. Silva’s death for doubtful points in phonetics, objected to 
giving these verbs an object.

it appears to me they’ve already killed him.” He went to the 
same place. Seven robbers came out, as usual. He said, 
“Rock, open!” The first thing he saw was his brother lying - 
dismembered in the middle of the floor. He put him into the 
sack, took it on his back, and went home. He said to his sister- 
in-law, “I found my brother cut up piece by piece. [I’m going 
to look for a shoemaker to sew him together. I'll put him in a 
bed, we will make out that he died suddenly.” (The woman had 
three boys and one girl.) “If one of your boys wants to be a 
doctor or a priest, we'll make him one. If the other wants to be 
a governor, we'll educate him for it. The girl we'll teach what 
\. she wants to know. What money you want, or what you need, 
‘I will give to you to the end of your life.” They put the dead- 
an in bed, the shoemaker came and sewed him up, they gave 
im a lot of money for his work. When the seven robbers came, 
they did not find the dismembered man; they said, “A robber 
has been in our house again.” The next day they left one 
robber in the house again, but no one came. The captain of the 
robbers said that he was going into the city to see where they had 
buried him. The first house he came to was the house of the 
shoemaker. The shoemaker was at work. The captain said to 
him, “You sew well, can you not make me a pair of shoes?” The 
shoemaker answered, “That is nothing. Yesterday I sewed up 
a man’s body that they cut up joint by joint.” He had agreed 
with the poor brother not to tell. The captain knew that was 
the place. He said to the shoemaker, “Go with me. Show me 
the place. I'll pay you twice as much as they paid you.” The 
shoemaker showed him the place. The captain went home, he 
put the six robbers each into a barrel, he rolled the barrels on the 
road. He rolled them to the house of the widow. He asked her 
if she wanted to buy molasses. The woman said, “No.” The 
boys went to the house of their uncle, they asked him to buy the 
molasses. They told the captain to put the barrels in the house 
of their uncle. While they were cooking for the captain, the 
children took the corkscrew to get out the molasses. They bored 
a hole in the barrel; the man inside the barrel asked, “‘Is it time?” 
The little boy said to him, “No, wait a while.” He told his 
mother that somebody was inside the barrel. The mother went 
and bored holes in all the barrels. “Is it time? Is it time?” 
they asked. ‘“‘Wait a while,” said the woman, “wait a while.” 
The woman took a club, she went behind the captain sitting at

table, she gave it to him on the head, she killed him. The 
woman put on the fire a big cauldron of water. She turned up 
all the barrels, in each she made a big hole. She poured boiling 
water into the barrels, she killed all the robbers. Then she sent 
to call two of her kinsmen. They dug a big hole in the yard, 
they buried the bodies! The poor brother went back to the 
rock, he took out the rest of the money, he brought it home, he 
divided it with the widow. The eldest son of the woman became 
a doctor; the second son, a governor; the third, a priest. The 
girl became a schoolmistress. The four children and the widow 
together built a fine house in their place. The road to their 
house was paved with gold.2 When the widow died, she left all 
her wealth to my father. My father was so miserable, he drank up 
all that money and left me none. 
1 Variants: (a) The poor brother has a daughter who is a said’ (soothsayer, medicine 
manor woman). The head robber goes into town to sell wine, putting the six robbers in 
the wine-barrels. The said’ saws the barrels in two. As the head man sits at the table, 
he has in front of him the hand of an unchristened child. [It is said in Fogo that if any 
one has good luck in nefarious pursuits, he has in his possession the hand of a minin’ 
mouro, a Moorish (i.e., heathen) child. See JAFL 34: 100, AAI : 55~59.] 
(8) When the rich brother fails to return home, his wife at midnight goes to her brother- 
in-law’s. He says, “Keep quiet! To-morrow I’ll find out about him.” ... He brings 
back his quartered brother loaded on a donkey and covered up with wood. He tells his 
sister-in-law not to cry, he has money enough to support two women. “Send your 
servant to the drug-store to get medicine for your husband and to say he is sick unto 
death.” He sends his own servant, Mesiana, to blindfold and bring the shoemaker to 
sew up the body.... Mesiana wails outside about his sudden death.... The robber 
coming into the city says to the shoemaker, “You have good eyes, sewing this time of 
night.” — “Oh, I did some work a few days ago later than this.” The robber reblind- 
folds him so he can the better sense out the place. The robber marks 15 on it with red 
chalk.... In the morning Mesiana, going to market, sees the mark. She rubs it out 
and chalks in 12. On the two houses above and the two below she chalks 15. The rob- 
ber chief (mestro) is so vexed with their messenger for the confusion, he kills him, leaving 
the band thirty-nine. He sends another. Episode with shoemaker is repeated. This 
robber marks 13. Mesiana changes it to 5, and chalks 13 on the others. The chief kills 
the second robber, leaving them thirty-eight.... The chief takes in the thirty-seven 
robbers in barrels loaded on a wagon. He asks Ali Baba where he can store his barrels of 
oil, “Under the verandah,” answers Ali Baba. Mesiana does not like the looks of the 
chief. She tells the drummer-boy there is no oil in the lamps, to fetch some from the 
barrels. When the boy takes out the plug, he hears a voice asking, “Is this the time?” .. . 
Mesiana pours boiling oil into barrels. The men inside kick and kick. “You may kick 
as much as you like,” says she. She puts a knife in her belt and dances before the chief. 
As he is pulling out money for her, she dances up close to him and stabs him.... Ali 
Baba marries Mesiana to his son. (San Nicolao.) 
2 Variant: The rich brother’s widow grows poorer and poorer. She is even more 
reduced than the poor brother had been. Finally she sends her children to him for some- 
thing to eat. He says, “I have plenty of room in my house for you and your children, 
and I have food and clothes for you. Come and make use of everything as if you were my 
vite, and your children mine.” She comes, and there she lives a happy life. (Cab’

2.1 MOCK CROWING: MOCK SUNRISE: THE UNYIELDING TREES. 
Pedr’ 2 had a place in the country where he had good food. 
One day Wolf met Pedr’. He said to him, “Ah! Nephew, where 
have you been, and what have you been eating, that you are so 
fat? Your Uncle Wolf has been around here without being able 
to find a thing to eat.”—- “O Uncle Wolf! I won’t take you where 
I get food. You’re too desperate a fellow. They’d catch you, 
they’d kill you.” Wolf answered, “No, I won’t be desperate. 
Take me!”—‘Good! To-morrow at dawn I'll take you.” That 
night Wolf did not sleep. At midnight he knocked at Pedr’s 
door. Pedr’ said, ““O Uncle Wolf! gohome. It’s still the middle 
of the night. Nobody would go at this hour.” At one o’clock 
Wolf began to crow like a cock,—‘‘ Cécoricé! Cécoricé! Cécoricé!” 
He knocked at Pedr’s door. Pedr’ got up. Pedr’ said to him, 
“Tt’s too early yet. Go home! Go home! It’s too early yet. 
It’s you crowing like a cock. Go home!” - 
Wolf had a little shelter. He waited a while, then he set the 
little shelter on fire. He knocked at Pedr’s door. Pedr’ got up. 
He saw the light. He [Wolf] said, “It’s morning.”—‘ Uncle 
Wolf, I don’t know what to do with you. Here you are setting 
your little shelter on fire. Now you will live on the street.” 
Wolf was desperate. Finally he called Pedr’, again Pedr’ got 
up. They went to a place where there were many animals. 
Pedr’ said to him, “This is the place. Sit down, eat what you 
like.” | Wolf sat down and ate, ate, ate. Then Pedr’ said to him, 
“Uncle Wolf, it’s time to go.” Wolf sang,— . 
“ Pedr’, Pedr’, here you are alive, 
Here before me. 
The sun has risen; it rises early, early; 
It shines here early, it shines there.” 
[This song meant that he had not eaten yet for his sons, or for his 
wife Maria Gongale.] Pedr’ called him again for them to go.

Usually in the tales about Wolf and his nephew the junior is called “Nephew” [Sobrinh’,

proper name rather than as a term of relationship. Xobrinh’ or Xobinh’ is sometimes used 
as an indication of Wolf’s comical way of speaking (see p. 12, note 7).

“Pedr’, Pedr’, here you are alive,

The sun has risen; it rises early, early; 
It shines here early, it shines there.” 
He said, “All right, Pedr’, give me some water.”” Pedr’ took him 
to a well. After drinking, he said, “All right, Pedr’! Now let 
us go!” 
On their way they came to three mango-trees. Wolf was so 
full, he said, ““Mango, Mango, move out of the way! Let me 
pass!” The mango-trees answered, ‘‘Pedr’ passes by here, and 
never disturbs us. You disturb us.” Wolf said, “If you don’t 
move, I shall pull you up.” The mango-trees did not move. 
Wolf forced his way through them. He split in two. All the 
food and water came out, and he died. Pedr’ went home. He 
enjoyed his life without Wolf. 
31 PICKING TEETH: THE PASSWORD: THE GIVE-AWAY 
(IN THE ASHES), 
There was a wolf with [his] nephew. One day they separated, 
Wolf went to Ferrero, Nephew went to Sparadinha, to meet again 
at Figondago. When they met, Wolf asked him, “Nephew, how 
is it you are so fat and I am so poorly? Where is it you eat?” — 
“T’ve been going about gathering rats and lizards under the stones, 
Uncle Wolf. That’s what makes me fat.”—‘“This makes the 
seventh day I’ve been eating lizards,” said Wolf. “I’ve a little 
tail in my teeth. Come take it out!”” Nephew took a needle to 
get it out. ‘‘No, Nephew, don’t you remember it was a needle 
which sewed up the shroud of our mothers?” Nephew took a 
pin. “No, Nephew, don’t you remember pins were used as nails 
in the casket of our mothers?” Nephew took a straw. “No, 
Nephew, don’t you remember it was a straw that choked our 
mothers to death? Why don’t you take it out with your finger?” 
Nephew went to take it out with his fingers, Wolf caught his 
fingers in his teeth. ‘Nephew, you are a smart fellow, but I am 
smarter than you. Remember, I am your uncle. I won’t let 
you go until you tell me the truth about where you eat.”—

“Uncle Wolf, I eat at Aunt Ganga’s.! I was afraid to take you 
there. You are very unlucky, you might die. If Aunt Ganga 
catches us there, she'll kill us.” —“Nephew, you take me there,” 
—<Well, when we go, you take a bag with you; when you eat 
one egg, you put fifty in the bag.” They went, Nephew put a 
hundred eggs in the bag, he ate one. Wolf, when he had eaten 
two hundred, would put one in the bag. “Time to leave, 
Uncle Wolf,” said Nephew. “TI have still an empty place in my 
stomach,” said Wolf. ‘‘I have still to eat for my grandparent,* 
for my father, for my mother, for my wife, and for my children.” 
Nephew left him there. He said to him, “Wolf, when you are 
ready to come out, you say, ‘Door tobéc tob4c’!’ When you 
come out, you say, ‘Door burnéc’!’” When Wolf was ready to 
come out, he said, “Door burnéc’, door burnéc’!”” The door shut 
tight. He could not get out, he sat down behind the door. 
Nephew was outside, he saw Aunt Ganga coming there. On 
the edge of a little hill he sang,— 
“My little stick of mint, 
Which is going to beat Sir Uncle Wolf, 
Aunt Ganga comes from gathering wood.” 
Inside the door Wolf sang,— 
“Nephew, you are deceitful, 
You bring me into a person’s house to eat well, 
You know I have [but] little luck. 
Door burnéc’ burnéc”!”” 
Outside Aunt Ganga sang,— 
“Oo! Oo! rain falls, sun shines, dew falls, 
And I am coming.” 
Nephew sang,— 
“My little stick of mint, 
Which is going to beat Sir Uncle Wolf, 
Aunt Ganga comes from gathering wood.” 
Wolf sang,— 
“Nephew, you are deceitful, 
You bring me into a person’s house to eat well, 
You know I have [but] little luck.

Now Aunt Ganga came up with her bundle of wood. She put it 
on the ground; she said, “Door tobéc tobac!”” Inside the door 
Wolf sang, “Door burnéc’!”? Again Aunt Ganga said, “Door 
tobéc tobdc’!”’ Again Wolf said, “Door burnéc’!”? Aunt 
Ganga sat down; she said, ‘“‘Door, every day when I say, ‘Door 
tobéc tobac’!’ you open; why don’t you open to-day?” Then 
the door flew open. Wolf ran to get under the bed. Aunt 
Ganga made coffee, she drank, she lay down in bed. She broke 
wind. ‘You dirty pig!” said Wolf under the bed. Aunt Ganga 
looked around everywhere. She saw nobody. She went back 
to bed. She broke wind again. ‘You dirty pig, to break wind 
with me under the bed!”” This time Aunt Ganga saw Wolf under 
the bed. He came out, he jumped up, he caught hold of the 
roof-truss. Aunt Ganga began to beat him. “Aunt Ganga, my 
hand is tired! My whole body is tired!”—~“ Come down, let me 
kill you!” Wolf dropped, he fell into a pile of ashes, he was lost. 
Just then Nephew passed by. ‘“‘O Nephew, come here, come 
here!” called Aunt Ganga; “‘Wolf was here, he disappeared from 
sight.” Nephew said, ““The Barela! race never die without 
breaking wind.” Wolf heard him, he broke wind like a blast, 
he discovered himself. Then Aunt Ganga killed him.

(The tale begins with the episode of the meat in the teeth.) 
Tobinh’* said he would tell Uncle Lob’. “But you’ve got to 
learn the rule,” he said. 
It was a fig-tree. You could not reach the tree, it was too high. 
You had to say, ‘“Come down! Come down! Come down!” 
The tree would come down, and you would get on it and say, 
“Go up! Go up! Go up!” and it would go up as far as you 
wished. Then it would stop. When you got enough to eat, you 
would say, “Come down! Come down! Come down!” and 
then it would come down. Mr. Lob’ was hungry; and he went to 
the tree, and he said, “Come down! Comedown! Comedown!” 
and then he said, ‘‘Go up! Goup! Go up!” and then he said, 
“Stop!” When he got through eating, he forgot the rule; and

instead of saying, “Come down!” he kept saying, “Go up!” and 
the tree kept going up.’ It went way up to heaven. When Mr. 
Lob’ got there, God ‘said, ‘What are you doing here?”! God 
said, “You take this piece of leather and go down and wash it 
off, and bring it back to me. I'll make a drum for you, and I'll 
tie a string on you; and when you get down to the bottom, you 
play your drum, and J’ll know you’re there, and I'll cut the string.” 
When he went to wash the leather, he was hungry, and he ate it. 
When he came back, he told God the water carried the leather 
away while he was washing it. God gave him another piece of 
leather. He was still hungry, and he ate it. And when he came 
back, he told God again that the water had carried the leather 
away while he was washing it. God gave him another piece of 
leather, and this time God sent an angel along with him to watch 
him, to see if he was telling the truth. Every time he went to put 
the leather into his mouth, the angel said, “Eh! What are you 
doing?” And he said, “Oh! I ain’t eatin’ it, I’m just smelling 
it.’ God made a drum for him. And he tied him to a string. 
_ “When you get down, you play the drum,” God said, “and Pll 
know you’re down, and I'll cut the string and let you go.” On 
the way down Mr. Lob’ saw a bluejay. He kept calling out,

and the breast comes down, and he takes milk. Wolf does not want to stop sucking and 
say, “Breast up!” so Nephew calls out, “Breast up!” and the breast goes up, and Wolf 
with it. “What are you doing here?” God asks him. “I don’t know, Nephew sent 
me up,” answers Wolf, (Fogo.) :

is a long time since I have seen you. You don’t come near me. See how fat and fine 
you are, and here am I about here catching only grasshoppers!”... Pedr’ takes Wolf to 
the fig-tree he ate from. It is a tall tree. Pedr’ calls, “Figueirinha, ba’xo, ba’xol??

“Then I won’t give it to you.” Mr. Lob’ was hungry, and he 
thought ofascheme. ‘“‘I’ll holler out to Tobinh’ to put mattresses 
down for me to fall on,” he said to himself. So he played the 
drum, and God cut the string, and he fell. As he was tumbling 
over and over, he kept hollering to Tobinh’, “Tobinh’, Tobinh’, | 
put mattresses and hay down for me!”’ The bird flew away and 
Jaughed at him. And when Tobinh’ heard him, he took all his 
forks and knives and razors and broken glass, pins, all the sharp- 
pointed things he could find, and put them for Uncle Lob’ to fall 
on.! And Mr. Lob’ fell on them, and that was the end of Mr.

5.2 TO HEAVEN BY LADDER: GOD MAKES A DRUM: THE PASSWORD: 
THE GIVE-AWAY (IN THE ASHES). 
There was a man named Pedr’, and [there was] Sir Wolf. This 
wolf was married to a woman named Zabél Gongale.? Wolf was 
malign. He planned to make a ladder of mortars to go up into 
the sky to see Our Lord.*- He put one mortar on top of another. 
When Wolf was near Our-Lord, Zabél Gongale called out to him, 
she said that she needed one mortar to parch corn. “Take one 
from the bottom,” said Wolf. 
When Wolf reached Our Lord, he asked him for a goat-skin to 
make himself a little drum. He had to take the skin to the sea 
to wash it. Every time he put it into the water, he took a piece, 
until he ate it all up. He went and told Our Lord that the sea 
had got his goat-skin. Our Lord gave him another skin. “Spank 
its and don’t let the sea get it from you! I won’t give you

him. When Wolf started to bite the skin, St. Peter said, ‘Ps! 
Ps!”—“] was finding out if there is salt* in it,” said Wolf. 
After Wolf took the skin to Our Lord, Our Lord made him a little 
drum. He tiedaropetohim. “Take this little drum with you,” 
said Our Lord; “when you get down to earth, play on it. Tl 
know that you have arrived, I’ll let go the rope.” Half way down 
Wolf met an ant dragging food. “If you'll give me a piece, I'll 
play the drum for you,” said Wolf to Ant, “T'll play ‘St. John of 
God.’” 4 Ant agreed, Wolf played the drum in double-quick 
time. Our Lord let go the rope. When Wolf felt himself falling, 
he called out to a large stone under him, “Get out of my way! 
Get out of my way! TI’ll smash you into flour!” § He fell down, 
he smashed himself into flour. The ants came and picked him 
all up, they carried him into their hole. 
Here Wolf became whole again.* In the day-time the owner 
of the land where Wolf fell came along. “Get off here!” Wolf 
said to him, “or I’ll arrest you.”” The man ran away, and Wolf 
took possession. He said to his wife, “Our Lord has given me a 
big piece of land.” He wanted his wife to come and see it, and 
he wanted his nephew to come too. “Your nephew Pedr’ is after 
you,” said Zabél Gongale. “The best thing for you to do is to 
-leave him alone.” When Wolf met Nephew, he saw that he was 
fine and fat. “Where have you been eating, Nephew?’ Tell 
me, so I can go there too and get fat.”” Nephew objected to 
telling; but he said, “I have been eating in Aunt Ganga’s nest. 
I ate her eggs. I will take you there; but one thing I must beg 
of you: after we have eaten, when I say it is time to go, we must 
go quickly, so. Aunt Ganga won’t catch us.” When they reached 
Aunt Ganga’s house, Nephew said, “Door, cubic, cubic!” and

when they went in, “Door, cushac, cushac!” Nephew ate half 
a dozen eggs, Uncle Wolf ate three dozen. Then Nephew said, 
“Well, Uncle Wolf, it is time to go.”—“‘O you rogue!” answered 
Wolf. “You're crazy to go.”—“I must go,” insisted Nephew; 
and in a soft voice he said, “Door, cubic, cubic!” The door 
opened, he went out. “Door, cushac, cushac!” The door 
closed. Uncle Wolf ate and ate until he could hardly walk. He 
rolled to the door; he said, ‘“Cushac, cushac!” The door did 
not open. “Cushac, cushac!” The door did not open. ‘“Cushac, 
cushac!! You devilish door, if you don’t open, I’ll break you 
in!” Then came Aunt Ganga. She stopped under a mulberry- 
tree; she sang,— 
“T am tired, I am tired, 
I am tired, very tired, 
I lay down in this shade, 
In this shade, lovely shade!” 
Now Pedr’ was behind the house with his viola; he sang,— 
“Uncle Wolf, you know well what I told you, 
To open the door, you told the door to close. 
Tunden, tunden, my little viola, 
There comes Aunt Ganga to get a big rat. 
Tunden, tunden, my little viola, 
There comes Aunt Ganga to get a big rat.” 
When Aunt Ganga was rested, she said, “Door, cubic, cubic!” 
But before the door opened, Uncle Wolf inside said, “Door, 
cushac, cushac!”—“‘Cubic, cubic!” said Aunt Ganga; “Cushac, 
cushac!” said Uncle Wolf. “Cubic, cubic!!”—‘ Cushac, cushac!!” 
—“If you don’t open, I'll break you in!” said Aunt Ganga; 
and she took a stone, she broke in the door. When Wolf saw 
Aunt Ganga coming in, he ran, he hid under her bed. After a 
while she lay down on the bed to rest, she let out wind—rup! 
“O you hog!” exclaimed Uncle Wolf. ‘Don’t you know a man is 
under your bed?” Then she let out some more wind — rup! 
rup!! (It was time for her to lay an egg.) ‘“‘O you hog! Don’t 
you know that there is a man here?” Now Aunt Ganga heard 
Wolf. ‘And you are the one I want to see!” she answered. 
She took a stick, she began to beat Wolf. He could not hold out 
any longer, he jumped, he caught the roof-truss. He held out 
until he was tired. “I’m tired hanging here, Aunt Ganga,” he 
said. “If you’re tired holding by your hands, hold by your feet!”

she said. Wolf let go his hands, he fell into a pile of ashes in the 
fireplace.1 He was lost in the ashes. “‘Wolf’s yellow race never 
dies without letting out wind,” said Ganga. Wolf heard, he let 
out wind—rup! up blew the ashes, he showed just where he was. 
Ganga began to beat him again, she left him almost dead. As 
soon as he escaped, he set the house on fire. 
6. IN THE Cow’s BELLY? 
There was a wolf with his nephew. Nephew used to go into a 
cow toeat. The cow got skinny, but they did not know Nephew 
was eating inside her. One day Nephew met Uncle Wolf; and 
Uncle Wolf asked him, ‘Where do you eat to make you fat?”— 
“T’m not going to take you there, Uncle Wolf. You are too 
greedy. You would go in, you would not come out.”—“O 
Nephew! take me with you! I'll eat only a little bit. Take me 
with you! I’m getting old. I want to get fat on my body.” 
Pedr’ took his uncle to the cow. He'said, “Cow, open my 
mouth, let me enter!””» When they went in, Pedr’ said, “Cow, 
close my mouth!” After they had eaten a while, Pedr’ said, 
“Uncle Wolf, it is time to go.’—“‘Get away from me, Nephew! 
T have to eat for my children and for my wife.” So Nephew left 
him. He told him when he wanted to go out, to say, “Cow, 
open my mouth, let me go out!” When Wolf was ready to go 
out, he said, “‘Cow, close my mouth, close my mouth!” But the 
cow only tightened up. “Shut, devil! Shut, devil! Shut, 
devil!” shouted Wolf. He could not get out, he began to eat 
again. He ate and ate until he ate in the line of the cow’s heart, 
and the cow dropped dead. 
Next day the owner of the cow went to skin it. Pedr’, behind 
the man, said, “Work carefully, there is something inside that

cow.” But they went on cutting, they paid no attention to 
Pedr’. Uncle Wolf was in the maw of the cow. They took out’ 
the maw, they shook it over the rock. Uncle Wolf dropped out 
below, he stood there as if he had been standing there before they 
shook the maw over him. He began to make out that he would 
hand them over to justice. ‘I stood here working, they found 
nothing to do but come and shake this dirty thing over me.”— 
“Don’t hand me over to justice!” begged the owner of the cow. 
“Tl give you a quarter of this cow.”—‘‘No, I won’t accept a 
quarter,” said Wolf. “I'll give you one-half.”—‘‘No, I won’t 
accept one-half.”’—‘“‘I’ll give you three-quarters.” —‘‘ No, I won’t 
accept three-quarters.” And Wolf started for court. “Don’t 
go! I'll give it all to you.’—“‘All right!” He took the cow. 
He buried three quarters, and he took one quarter home to his 
wife, Isabel Gongalbe. ‘‘Nephew thinks he is smarter than I 
am,” he said to her, “but I am smarter than he.”—‘‘ Nephew will 
kill you yet,” answered Isabel Goncalbe. “I am the son of my 
father and the son of my mother,! no one is going to kill me.” 
Early next morning Wolf went to the place where he had 
buried the meat. It was near the house of some ants, and he 
found them taking the meat. He started to fight with them, he 
wanted to put them into his bag to take home to his wife, so she 
could help him kill them. They crawled all over him, tore his 
clothes into pieces. ‘“‘Wait!” he exclaimed, digging at his hair. 
“That’s not the way to fight! That’s not the way to fight!” 
Then he forgot about the meat, and ran home to his wife to escape 
from the ants. The ants and the birds enjoyed the meat. To 
this day what Uncle Wolf needs he has to steal. 
7.2 PICKING TEETH: TOO SWOLLEN TO ESCAPE. 
There was a wolf with hisnephew. They agreed to separate,— 
Wolf to go north, Nephew to go south,— and at the end of thirty 
days to meet to see who was the fatter. When they met again, 
Nephew was the stouter, and Wolf was poorly. “‘Why are you 
so fat, Nephew, and I so poorly?” asked Wolf. ‘J’m sure I 
don’t know,” answered Nephew. ‘‘Haven’t we been eating the 
same things?” Wolf said that he had a bone in his teeth. “I

want you to takeit out.” Nephew said, “Let me take it out with 
arazor!” Wolf refused. ‘No, a razor killed our grandmother.” 
—“‘Let me take it out with a pin!”—‘No, a pin killed our 
mother.” —‘Let me take it out with a needle!”—‘‘No, a needle 
killed our father. No, don’t use any of those things. I want 
you to take it out with your fingers.” When Nephew started to 
take it out with his fingers, he (Wolf] bit him in his finger? “I’m 
not going to let you go, Nephew, until you tell me what it is you 
eat, that you are so fat.’—‘‘Let me go, Uncle Wolf!” said 
Nephew. “I promise to show you a house where you will get 
plenty to eat.” 
Then Nephew took Uncle Wolf to the house of Iran? Here 
Wolf ate so many eggs, that his stomach filled up so much that he 
could not go out of the door, When Iran came home, he found 
him lying on the ground. He took a razor, he cut his belly. 
Then he went to report in the city that he had killed Wolf. They 
told him that he might go free. 
That’s the end. 
8. THE LADY VISITOR.® 
There was a boy. Hehadacow. He went out tosellit. He 
walked and walked all day until he came to a house where there 
were three robbers. He said, “Will you buy my cow?” They 
said, ‘“Yes. Come into the house!” They took the cow and 
killed it. They cooked it, and they invited the boy to dinner. 
The boy had his dinner, and waited till late at night. Then he 
said, ““Aren’t you going to pay me, so I can go home?” The 
robbers said, ‘““What! Pay you? You have eaten your cow, and 
you want money for it too?” Then one of the robbers gave the 
little boy a kick, and said, “This is your money.” So the little 
boy went home crying. He said to himself, “What can I do to

make those robbers pay me?” He said, “I know what I'll do. 
Pll go to the dressmaker and I’ll buy a girl’s dress, the prettiest 
dress, a dress like a princess’s, and I’ll buy a silk kerchief for my 
head.” He dressed up like a girl, and went to the woods and cut 
a big club, and put it under his dress. He went on to the robbers’ 
house. When the robbers saw him looking like a girl, they hol- 
lered to him, “Come here, little girl! We have something to say 
to you.” So he said, “No, I have no time to stay, because my 
mother sent me on an errand and told me to be quick; but if you 
want me very much, I will stay a little while.”” So he went to the 
house, and they went and made a feast and danced until dark. 
He said, “‘Now I'll have to go home. My mother will be waiting 
for me.” They said, “No, you can’t go home now, it’s too late.” 
He said, “Which one of you am I going to sleep with?” He chose 
the one who gave him the kick. He said, “I will sleep with this 
man to-night,— and you to-morrow night,— and with you the 
night after.’ Each robber had his own house,— three houses. 
They said good-night to the other two and went to bed. The 
boy said, “Now, sir, you undress first and get to bed, because I 
have to say prayers for my mother and father and all my relatives 
who died a long time ago.” So he said, “All right!” He waited 
and waited, and said, “Haven’t you got through praying yet?” 
He said, “Not yet.” He said, “I will sleep with you if you sleep 
naked, because I am going to sleep naked too.” He said, “‘All 
right, I'll sleep naked.” In the middle of the night, when the 
robber fell asleep, [the boy] took his stick and gave him a good 
hard beating in the head. He hit him and hit him, saying, “If 
you holler, Pl kill you.” He said, “You know whol am?” The 
robber said, ‘‘No.”-—‘I am the owner of that cow you killed the 
other day. So, if you don’t pay me now, I'll finish you.” He 
said, “I can’t get up to pay you.” He said, ‘“‘Show me where you 
keep your money, and I’ll go get it.” So he told him where the 
money was, and all his gold. The boy filled his bag, left him, and 
went away. The next morning, when the other two robbers 
came to call him, nobody answered. They said, ‘‘We’ll have to 
find out if they are in here or not.” They broke the door and 
went in, and found the man all beaten up and unable to talk. 
All he could say was, “It was the owner of the cow who came.” 
They said, ““What! the owner of the cow! What shall we do?” 
They all began to cry. 
The owner of the cow went and hired for one day a doctor’s

suit, a valise, and a horse, all for soo pes’. He passed by the 
robbers’ house. The robbers saw him, and called out, “O Sir 
Doctor! will you please come and see what’s the matter with our 
brother. He is very ill.” The doctor said he was on his way toa 
case, and he couldn’t stop. And they begged him and begged 
him to help them, otherwise their brother would die without a 
doctor. The doctor said, “Yes, I will go.” So the doctor came. 
He said, “I will cure your brother.” He said to the others, “You 
will have to go four miles off to get some herbs, some pailh’ 
teixeira and some /asua eruda,” He said, “One of you go to Isia, 
one go to Ferer’.” When the two had gone, the doctor took his 
club and beat the sick man. He-said, “Do you know me?” He 
said, “I’m the owner of the cow. Show me where the money of 
your brother is.” He took the money of one of the other robbers 
away with him. When the brothers returned with the herbs, 
they didn’t find the doctor. And the poor sick robber said, “It 
is the owner of the cow.” He was sick unto death. So they 
boiled their herbs and washed him. Then they sat down and 
cried all night by the side of their sick brother. Next morning 
the boy went to the priest and borrowed his suit just for one day. 
He promised to pay him. The priest agreed. He took his horse, 
and he started out.. When he went by the robbers’ house, the 
robbers saw him go by. They thought it was the priest. They 
called out, “Please come in and confess our brother before he 
dies.” He said, “TI can’t come, I’m on an important mission.” 
They begged and begged for him to come. He went in. They 
said, ‘We will pay you what you want.” He found the sick man 
could hardly speak. The priest sent one brother three miles off 
to the church in Santa Barbara to get some incense, the other to 
the church in San Anton to get some holy water. The priest took 
his club and beat the sick man. He said, ““Do you know me? 
I’m no priest, I am the owner of the cow. Show me where the 
money of your other brother is.” He took the bag of money and 
went home. When the two brothers returned, they found no 
priest, they found no money, and they found their sick brother 
almost dead. He was in bed three weeks. A whaling-vessel 
came by that place about two miles off shore. The owner of the 
cow went on board and told the captain he would sell him three 
men. The owner of the cow went up on a high hill, took his horn, 
and began to blow. He said that the whaling-vessel was waiting: 
for men to go out on her whaling. The three robbers packed up

and went on board the vessel. After sailing three years, they 
wanted to be discharged. The captain told them he bought 
them from the owner of the cow. They began tocry. And they 
were slaves forever. The owner of the cow took all their property 
for himself.

(Variant a.) 
There was a man, a hunter. His name was Lion-of-the-Forest. 
He was a man of great strength. One day he went hunting, he 
saw a chicken on a fig-tree. He pointed the gun at the chicken; 
the chicken called out, “Don’t shoot me! Even if you shoot and 
kill me, you are not going to eat me.” Lion-of-the-Forest an- 
swered, “‘ You are a chicken, I am a hunter; if I shoot you, I shall 
eat you.” He shot her, he killed her, he took her home, he 
cooked her, he ate her. As soon as he ate her, he swelled up. 
(It was an enchanted chicken.) 
Sir Wolf was passing where Lion-of-the-Forest lived, he saw 
him swollen up. Wolf said to him, “I’m sorry to see you so 
swollen and disfigured. Better let me rub something on you.” 
By this time Lion-of-the-Forest was feeling very sick, he agreed. 
Wolf began to rub. While he was rubbing, he cut off Lion’s 
penis. Heateitup. Lion-of-the-Forest said to him, “I am sick, 
you do what you like with me. If I die, that’s the end; but if I 
live, you’ll pay me for it.” After a while Lion-of-the-Forest got 
better, he considered how he could catch Wolf. But Wolf was 
hiding away because he remembered what he did. One day after 
Lion-of-the-Forest saw he could not catch Wolf, he met Nephew. 
He asked, “‘Nephew, what shall I do to catch your Uncle Wolf?” 
Nephew answered, “Don’t you worry! I'l! tell you. Every 
morning we go to the corral to milk. Now, you know my Uncle 
Wolf desires women excessively. Do you dress up as a woman, 
put a bundle * on your head, pass by the corral at the hour we are 
milking. As you approach, I’ll call out to you to comein. The 
corral is Uncle Wolf’s, he will say that he alone has the right to 
invite anybody in.” 
Lion-of-the-Forest dressed himself as a woman. He walked

out towards the corral where Wolf and Nephew were milking the 
cows. Nephew said, “Good-day!! Come in!” Uncle Wolf 
said, “Shut up, Nephew! This is my corral. You can’t invite 
anybody in Woman, where are you going?” The woman said 
to him, “I’m going to a wedding.” He said to her, “Come in, 
wait forme! I’m going there too. I’m one of the musicians.” — 
“I can’t come in, because it isn’t right for a woman.” ? Wolf 
said to her, “Don’t worry about that! I won’t annoy you.’ 
The woman agreed, she went in, she waited for him. Wolf said, 
“Nephew, get a bull-calf, kill it for us to eat. Get a little one.’” - 
But Nephew got a big one. When Wolf came in, Nephew had 
the meal already cooked, ready to serve up. “I told you to take 
a small one, you took the biggest of all,” grumbled Wolf. “All 
right! we have a woman in the house to please.” They sat down, 
they ate with.a relish. At night the woman said to Wolf, “I 
must be going.” Wolf said to her, ““Don’t worry! I have a 
room here for you. They’ll not worry, they’ll have to wait for me. 
I’m the musician; they won’t begin until I come.” Wolf showed. 
the woman the room. “Here we are, this is our room!” He 
said, “If you don’t mind, play a little before we lie down.” Wolf 
played on the viola; he sang,— 
“Tam Wolf, Big-Wolf, 
I ate the penis of Lion-of-the-Forest, 
The most valiant man there is in the world.” 
He said to the woman, “Sing like me!” The woman sang,— - 
“Sir Wolf says he is Wolf, Big-Wolf, 
He ate the penis of Lion-of-the-Forest, 
The most valiant man there is in the world.” 
They sang and sang again. Wolf found it very nice. He liked it 
so much that he went crazy blind. After they had sung a matter 
of an hour and a half, Wolf said, “It is time to go to bed.” The 
woman said to him, “Yes, but I want you to get into bed first.” 
“Tl do whatever you say.” Wolf put a chair at the foot of the 
bed for the woman to put her clotheson. The woman was dressed.

her clothes. Wolf thought that she was the nicest and cleanest 
woman he had seen. He called to Nephew to come in and see 
how many skirts she had on. The woman took all off, she left 
on only one. She said to Wolf, ““Send Nephew out, because I’m 
almost ready to go to bed.’”’ Wolf said, “Nephew, go out, lock 
the door, throw the key into the squash-patch! To-morrow 
morning, eight o’clock, come open the door!” When the woman 
took off her last skirt, Wolf saw the club and that the woman was 
aman. Wolf turned green. He yelled, “Nephew, come, open 
this door! I’m sick! I want to go out!”” Nephew was standing 
behind the door, he made no answer. Lion-of-the-Forest took 
his club, he beat Wolf. He beat and beat until he was almost 
dead. He opened the window, he sprang out. Next morning at 
eight o’clock Nephew opened the door, he found Wolf all depi- 
lated and disfigured. “‘Uncle Wolf, what is the matter with you? 
What made you like this?” Wolf answered, “Never in my life 
did I see a woman like that. I went to open the window to throw 
her out, I fell, I bruised myself.”” Nephew said, “Uncle Wolf, 
you are telling me lies. I was listening, I know all that went on 
here.” 
This is finished. 
9. THE THREE KIDs 
There was a goat-gazelle * had three young ones, named Melo, 
Maria, Sané. She raised them in a house that locked. She came 
in from the fields to suckle them every day; and she sang,— 
“Melo, Maria, Sané, 
Open the door to me to suckle you!” 
Wolf heard this song; and he sang with a gruff voice,— 
“Melo, Maria, Sané, 
Open the door to me to suckle you!” 
“O Sir Wolf! you’re not going to get us to eat,” they called to him. 
Wolf went to the said’ to ask her how he could make his voice soft 
like the goat’s. ‘‘Get a woollen blanket, a pot of water, and a

he went to Goat’s house, and sang,— 
“Melo, Maria, Sané, 
Open the door to me to suckle you!” 
They opened the door, and he swallowed the three of them. He 
went to the well for a drink. ‘Sir Wolf,” Well asked, “what 
have you eaten to make you thirsty?”—‘I have eaten goose- 
eggs,” answered Wolf.

met a donkey. Donkey said, ““Lady Goat-Gazelle, how is it that

tears?” —‘‘I have reason to cry, Sir Compa’ Donkey; Wolf has 
eaten up my three little ones.”—‘‘Come along with me. I will 
put Wolf into your hands,” said Donkey. When Wolf saw 
Donkey, he said, “Come here, Compa’ Donkey. You are the 
very one I’m looking for to eat.” When Donkey heard this, he 
ran away. Goat met anox. Ox said, “‘Lady Goat-Gazelle, how 
is it that every day I meet you singing and dancing, but to-day 
you are in tears?” —“‘I have reason to cry, Sir Compa’ Ox; Wolf 
has eaten up my three little ones.’—“‘Come along with me. I 
will put Wolf into your hands,” said Ox. When Wolf saw Ox, 
he said, “Come here, you Big-Neck! You are the very one whose 
blood I would drink.” When Ox heard this, he ran away. Goat 
met a horse. Horse said, “Lady Goat-Gazelle, how is it that 
every day I meet you singing and dancing, but to-day you are in 
tears?” —‘“‘I have reason to cry, Sir Compa’ Horse; Wolf has 
eaten up my three little ones.” —‘Come along with me. I will 
put Wolf into your hands,” said Horse. When Wolf saw Horse, 
he said, ‘Come here, Sir Compa’ Horse. You are the very one [ 
would wrestle with.” Horse made towards Wolf; but when 
Wolf also advanced, Horse ran away. Goat-Gazelle met an ant. 
“Lady Goat-Gazelle, how is it that every day I meet you singing 
and dancing, but to-day you are in tears?” —-“I have reason to 
cry, Coma’ Ant; Wolf has eaten up my three little ones.” —“‘Come 
along with me. I will put Wolf into your hands,” said Ant, 
When Wolf saw Ant, he said, “Coma’ Ant, I don’t think you 
can hand Wolf over to me. Big fellows like Donkey and Ox and 
Horse couldn’t, how can a little creature like you?” Ant went

up to Wolf, and Wolf swallowed her. Ant said, “I am the little 
ant the smoke of the pipe [camhor’] doesn’t blacken, the sun of the 
verandah! doesn’t burn.” She bit a hole in Wolf’s entrails? 
Wolf said, “Ant, let me alone!” —“I won’t let you alone until you 
let out the three sons of Goat-Gazelle.” Wolf discharged one. 
“That’s all,” he said. ‘“‘Comadre Ant, I have three sons,” said 
Goat-Gazelle. Ant bit Wolf again. Wolf said, “Ant, let me 
alone!”—“TI won’t let you alone until you let out the three sons 
of Goat-Gazelle.” Wolf discharged one. ‘“That’s all,” he said. 
“Comadre Ant, I have three sons,” said Goat-Gazelle. Ant bit 
Wolf again. Wolf said, “Ant, let me alone!”—“I won’t let you 
alone until you let out the three sons of Goat-Gazelle.” Wolf 
discharged the last one. Goat-Gazelle took her little ones and 
went off to the fields. 
(Variant a.*) 
What thing thing? There was a goat-gazelle. She had two 
children, Maria and Man’él. Every day she went to the moun- . 
tains, she left her children inside the house, the door closed. 
When she came, she called,— 
“Maria, Man’él, of such milk, 
Of such breast, of such grass, 
Let me now to the mountain!” 
And then Wolf came and listened to all she called. He waited 
until the time [?for the tide] the mother would come, he went and 
called. The children said that was not the speech of their mother. 
Then he saw the mother coming, he hid, he listened [to hear] how 
the mother called. The next day he went and called,— 
“Maria, Man’él, of such milk, 
Of such breast, of such grass, 
Let me now to the mountain!” 
The children opened the door. He swallowed both of them. The 
mother came and called her children,— 
“Maria, Man’él, of such milk, 
Of such breast, of such grass, 
Let me now to the mountain!”

Wolf answered,— 
“Tt is I, Sir Wolf, 
I ate the two sons of Goat-Gazelle, 
The meat I took away to make a tower, 
To give the tower a key in the morning. 
Penden piti pendent 
Ranchon chon odo!” 
Then the woman began to cry. Donkey came and asked what 
was the matter with her, that she was crying. She said to him, 
“T cannot keep from crying, because Wolf has eaten my children. 
He is inside the house, making fun of me.” He said, “Come with 
me, I will give you your children.” When she arrived, she called 
her children. Wolf answered;— 
“It is I, Sir Wolf, 
1 ate the two sons of Goat-Gazelle, 
The meat I took away to make a tower, 
To give the tower a key in the morning. 
Penden piti pendent 
Ranchon chon odo!” 
Donkey hee-hawed, he ran, he kicked the wall, he put down 
his feet [he struck a gait], he went his way. Then came Horse, 
he found her there sad. He asked her; ‘‘ What is the matter with 
you, that you are crying?” She said to him, “TI can’t keep from 
crying, because Wolf has eaten my two children. He is inside 
the house, making fun of me.” He said to her, “Come with me, 
I will give you your children.” Then, when she went, he told her 
to call her children. Then she called her children,— 
“Maria, Man’él, of such milk, 
Of such breast, of such grass, 
Let me now to the mountain!” 
‘Wolf answered,— 
“Tt is I, Sir Wolf, 
I ate the two sons of Goat-Gazelle, 
The meat I took away to make a tower, 
To give the tower a key in the morning. 
Penden piti pendent 
Ranchon chon o@o!”” 
Horse neighed, he kicked the wall, he ran, he went his way. 
Then came Lady Little-Ant going to the arroyo, she found Lady 
Goat-Gazelle crying. She asked her, “What is the matter with
-P-A-G-E-52
Folk-Lore from the Cape Verde Islands. 25 
you, that you are crying?” She said that she could not keep 
from crying, “because Wolf ate my two children. He is inside 
the house, making fun of me.” Then she said to her, “Come with 
me, I will give you your children.” She said that she would not 
go “because Horse and Donkey bigger [than you] went with 
me, they did not give it to me, what can you do, you who are 
smaller?” And after she insisted with her, they went. She 
arrived, she ordered her to call her children. She called,— 
“Maria, Man’él, of such milk, 
Of such breast, of such grass, 
Let me now to the mountain!” 
Wolf answered,— 
“Tt is I, Sir Wolf, 
I ate the two sons of Goat-Gazelle, 
The meat I took away to make a tower, 
To give the tower a key in the morning. 
Penden piti pendent 
Ranchon chon oao!” 
Ant answered, “‘And I am Little-Ant of the stone’s hole, who will 
eat to the guts, will suck to the marrow.”’ She entered by a hole 
in the door. She took hold of Wolf inside in the belly. She said, 
“Take out people’s children.” Wolf said, “Lady Goat-Gazelle, 
tell her to let me go, I will take out your children.” Ant answered, 
“Take them out first.” After he took them out, he ran, he went 
his way. Hence you see that one should not disparage one more 
little, because Ant, who gave her her children, was little. 
It is finished. 
101 THE THREE KIDS: THE LADY VISITOR: THE GIVE-AWAY 
(IN THE ASHES). 
There was once a little goat. She had three kids. Wolf had a 
pasture. She gave Wolf one of the kids to christen. Ant was 
the godmother. Wolf gave Goat the pasture. She kept her kids 
shut up in a house when she went to get grass for them. When 
she came, she sang to them to open the door to her,— 
“Léna, Bordé, Léna, 
O five skirts of contunusial” 
1 Informant, Jon Santana of San Vicente.
-P-A-G-E-53
26 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society. 
Wolf made a plan to eat up the kids. He went to Goat for her 
to teach him her song in exchange for the pasture. She said to 
him, “I will not teach you my song; for if I do, you will kill my 
kids.”—“‘No! Do you think I am bad [enough] to eat my god- 
son!” Goat taught him the song. He went to the house, he 
sang, they opened the door to him, he ate two, one went under the 
bed. When Goat returned, she found the door locked, she could 
not get in. She called her comadre to go through a little hole to 
see who was inside. Ant went in; she found Wolf lying down, 
his big belly up, rascal that he was. Ant came out and told Goat. 
They went to an orange-tree, each got a stick. They broke down 
the door, they began to beat Wolf. They buried him in the 
sand. Three days later Goat went out with her kid to get grass. 
Wolf got up out of the sand; he called out, “Ei, Comadre!” 
Goat said, “Is that you, Compadre?”—“ Yes, I am Wolf of the 
whipped buttocks.” He wanted to eat up the last kid. Goat 
saw that he was going to harm it. She went to see old woman - 
Mafanda,! from whom Wolf had stolen three seeds. Mafanda 
also wanted to catch him. Goat knew that Wolf liked to play the 
viola. She told Mafanda that Wolf liked to have people invite 
him to play at marriage-feasts. Mafanda said to Wolf, “You 
are a musician.” So, though Wolf could not play, he said, “Oh, 
me! I’m a good player.” Goat told him Mafanda was crazy to 
marry him. He went to the house of the dance. Mafanda was 
there, dressed up. Wolf played two pieces. Nephew told Wolf 
to play again. ‘‘There is a woman here who likes your playing. 
She wants to marry you.” He played another piece. Nephew 
showed him the woman. He was pleased. He laid down the 
viola, he said that he was sleepy. He arranged to go to sleep with 
the woman. Nephew went with them. Wolf told Nephew to 
close the door and throw away the key where it could not be 
found. The woman said she liked to sleep naked. Wolf took 
off all his clothes. When the woman started to undress, Wolf 
saw her horns and hair, he knew she was the woman he had 
robbed. Up he jumped and grabbed hold of the roof-truss. 
Tired holding on, he hollered to Nephew to bring the key. 
Nephew said, “You told me to throw it away. I threw it into 
the refuse-heap. It is night, I can’t find it. If your hands are 
tired, Uncle Wolf, hold with your feet.” Wolf called again, 
1 Mafanda subsequently becomes a creature with horns and hair. Perhaps there was a 
confusion of statement here, and it was Goat who took Mafanda’s place.

“I’m tired holding with my feet!”—“Let go with your feet! 
Hold with your teeth!”—“I’m tired holding with my teeth!”— 
“Tf you’re tired holding with your teeth, hold with your belly!” 
Wolf was such a fool, he thought his belly would hold him; he 
let go, he fell into the ashes where: the woman had been cooking. 
Up blew a cloud of ashes, the woman did not see him. She had 
beans for supper. She felt indisposed, she broke wind. Wolf 
heard, he kept quiet. When she broke wind again, Wolf said, 
“This is twice. To be sure, you are in your own house; but if 
you do it again, I’m going to break wind too.” The old woman 
broke wind again. Wolf said, “This is more than insolence. 
I’m going to break wind too.” He broke wind, the ashes on top 
of him blew off, he was discovered. The old woman saw him, 
she stuck her horns into his stomach. Wolf said, “My bad head 
is the death of me.” 
11.1 DETECTING BY THIRST: THE THREE KIDS: THE LADY VISITOR: 
THE GIVE-AWAY (IN THE ASHES): THE GIVE-AWAY (THE SHELTER 
SHAKES): FATAL IMITATION. 
There was a wolf. He found a goose-nest full of eggs, he ate 
them all up. When Goose? returned to her nest, she found no 
eggs. She went to the said’. She asked him to tell her who ate 
up her eggs. The said’ told her to go to a certain spring where all 
the animals came to drink; at the spring she was to ask all the 
animals that came what they ate to make them thirsty for a drink. 
First to come was Cow. Mistress Goose asked her, “Cow, what 
did you eat to make you thirsty to come and drink?” Cow 
answered, “I ate grass, which made me thirsty for a drink.” 
Mistress Goose said to her, “Drink water, and go your way!” 
Second to come was Horse. Mistress Goose asked him, “Horse, 
what did you eat to make you thirsty to come and drink?”— 
“T ate corn, which made me thirsty for a drink.” —“ Drink water, 
and go your way!” Next to come was Donkey. Goose asked

him, “What did you eat to make you thirsty to come and drink?” 
Donkey answered, “It was grass which I ate, which made me 
thirsty for a drink.”— Drink water, and go your way!” Next 
to come was Goat. Goose asked, “What did you eat to make 
you thirsty to come and drink?” —‘‘It was my little green grass 
at the foot of the rocks which J ate, which made me thirsty for a 
drink.” Goose said, “Drink, and go your way!” Next to come 
was Nephew. Mistress Goose asked him, “What did you eat to 
make you thirsty to come and drink?” Nephew answered her, 
“I killed my mother, I ate her up, that made me thirsty for a 
drink.” Goose said to him, “Drink water, and go your way!” 
Next to come was Sir Wolf. Mistress Goose asked him, “What 
did you eat to make you thirsty?” Sir Wolf answered, “That 
does not concern you, you have nothing to do with it.” Mistress 
Goose asked him again, “What did you eat to make you thirsty?” 
—You have nothing to do with it. If you ask me again, I will 
tell you what I ate.” Goose asked him again, “What did you 
eat to make you thirsty?” Wolf answered, “It was your eggs 
I ate, that made me thirsty.” 
Then Mistress Goose grabbed Wolf, she pulled out his guts, 
she filled his belly with sand. Sir Wolf went home. When he 
arrived, he sat down ona mortar. His child said to him, “What 
have you in your belly, papa?” Wolf jerked him away. His 
wife asked him, “What have you in your belly, husband?” Sir 
Wolf gave her two slaps.} 
Sir Wolf went out. He went and lay down near a pen where 
Gazelle kept her little ones. She would call them by name,— 
IN “Néca, Nacanéca, Sid!” 
They would come out to suckle their mother. Wolf said to him- 
self, ‘I wish I could get some of that milk!” When they finished 
suckling, they went inside. Mamma Gazelle went out. Wolf 
thought that he would call like their mother; he called,— 
“Fifi, Fifa, Mosa!” 
But the little gazelles did not come, for they knew it was not the 
voice of their mother. Wolf said to himself, “Next time when I 
call, J will catch you!” Next morning Gazelle came; she called, 
“Néca, Nacanéca, Sid!” 
1 This is a variant of the incident told more characteristically on p. 314.

Wolf listened carefully. Next morning Wolf came to the pen 
ahead of Gazelle. He called,— 
““Néca, Nacanéca, Sid!” 
The three little gazelles came out of the pen. Wolf swallowed all 
three. When Gazelle came, she called, they did not answer, she 
began to cry. 
She went to the said’ to ask him who took her little ones. The 
sai’’ told her to dress herself in her best clothes and to pass by 
Sir Wolf’s house. Gazelle dressed, she took the road which 
passed by Sir Wolf’s house. Wolf was lying down at the time, 
suffering from indigestion; but Nephew happened to be at the 
door outside. He saw Gazelle passing by in her fine clothes. 
He called to her to come in. Wolf jumped, he kicked Nephew. 
He said to him, “You can’t call any one into this house. This 
house is mine, with everything in it.” Gazelle came in. As 
soon as she came in, she said that she would not stay in a house 
without music. Sir Wolf said to her, “There’s music here.” 
He said, “Nephew, get my viola!” Wolf played his viola; he 
sang,— , 
“Whoever is like to me? 
Who ate up the three little ones of Gazelle? 
With their skin I will mend my drum, 
With their tripe I will string my viola.” 
Gazelle began to sing,— 
“Much do I like Sir Wolf di Pina!” 
Wolf said, ‘‘Nephew, lock the door and throw away the key!” 
Nephew locked the door, he put the key in his pocket. Gazelle 
had a kerchief tied around her head. When Wolf pulled off the 
kerchief, he saw her horns. He cried, “Nephew, open the door! 
I want to go out to relieve myself!” Nephew said to him, “I 
can’t open the door. You told me to lock the door and throw 
away the key.”” Then Gazelle began to butt Wolf in his belly. 
He flew up, he fell down into the ashes in the fireplace. Gazelle 
called Nephew. “Bring me a light,” she said to him, ‘“‘so I can 
see Wolf, so I can kill him!”” Nephew brought a light, but they 
could not find him. Wolf was buried in the ashes. Nephew 
said, “Our family never dies this way: they never die without 
letting out wind!” Wolf broke wind, the ashes rose up, they saw 
where Wolf was. Gazelle split open his belly, took out her three 
little ones, then she sewed up his belly again.

Wolf ran out, he went and hid behind a tree in wait for Nephew, 
to kill him. Nephew suspected him. When he came to the side 
of the tree, he said, “I know that I am safe, because wherever our 
relations stay, the tree shakes.” Wolf shook the tree. Nephew 
ran, he went his way. Wolf ran after him, he caught him, he 
clubbed him over the head. 
Nephew went home, he took a fat pig, he killed it, he tied a 
strip of the bacon around his head. He sent for Sir Wolf to come 
to see him because he was sick. When Sir Wolf came, Nephew 
said to him, “You beat me up well, but I wish you had beaten me 
sooner. I wish you had cracked my head long ago, Sir Uncle 
Wolf. See all this bacon coming out of this crack!” Wolf said 
to him, “Crack my head too! I want to get some bacon too.” 
Nephew took up a little stick. ' Wolf said, “That stick is very 
small, take a big one!” Then Nephew took a pestle. Wolf fell 
on his knees before him, he begged him to beat him with the stick 
as hard as he could. Nephew said to him, “When I give it to 
you with the stick, you say, ‘Bacon!’” Nephew gave it to him 
with the stick over his head. He said, “Bacon!” He gave it to 
him with the stick again. He said, “Bacon!” He gave it to 
him again. He said, “Bac’!” He gave it to him again. He 
said, ““Ba’!” He gave it to him again. He said, “B’!” Again 
he gave it to him. He said, “B’!”! Nephew beat Wolf to 
death.* :

There was a man married to a woman. For fifty years they 
had no child, then the woman had ason. There was a famine in 
the land: the cattle all died; there was no milk, no butter, nothing 
toeat. The child was crying from hunger; so the father took him 
to the side of a spring and put him in a hole of a banana-tree. 
There was another couple, married for sixty years, who also had a

Nephew makes Wolf his Horse.” In the Brava version, Nephew tells Wolf it is his wife 
who has thus beaten him to bring out the meat, and so Wolf makes Ais wife beat him. In 
another Fogo version, Nephew says it is a monkey who has beaten him and told him at 
each stroke to call out “Fat!” For the San Anton variant, see p. 60.

child who was born at that time. The man came to the spring 
to get water. He heard the child crying, he picked it up, he took 
it home to his wife. “Here is another child God has given us. 
Now we have two children to raise.’”” The woman suckled both 
babies. As there was a famine in the country, she did not have 
enough milk. They cried at night, they did not let her sleep. 
The woman said to her husband, “I can’t nurse both, better take 
away the child you found and let me save our own.”” The man 
took the child back to the banana-tree. He started to leave, it 
began to cry. As he had it in his house fifteen days and had 
grown fond of it, he turned back, he picked it up again. He took 
it home, he put it to a she-ass to nurse. The woman made a 
separate bed for the foundling, as she did not want it to lie with 
her own child. In six months the foundling was able to take his 
ass to the fountain to water and to take care of her. 
The two boys were christened; they gave one the name José, 
the other, Pedr’. They grew up, they went to school. José, the 
man’s son, was a dunce. Pedr’, the foundling, was quick and 
had a good head. In a little while he knew more than his teacher, 
they made him teacher. José was so dull, that one day Pedr’ 
gave him two slaps with the palmatoria.| José came home and 
told his mother. His mother told him about Pedr’, how he had 
suckled a donkey, and the woman called him Donkey-Son. The 
next time José saw Pedr’, he called him Donkey-Son. Pedr’ 
began to look in all his books [to see] if he could find the meaning 
of that name. When he came home, they gave him something to 
eat. He said that he had no time to eat. ‘My brother called 
me a name, I must look in my books to learn the definition of that 
name.” Next day at school José did not know the lesson. 
Again Pedr’ gave it to him with the pa/matoria. José called him 
Donkey-Son again. Pedr’ went home, he refused toeat. He said 
to his mother, ‘“‘I have looked in all my books, I cannot find the 
definition of this name Donkey-Son. Tell me what itis. Ifyou 
don’t tell me, I am going to kill José, even if you then kill me.” 
1 A paddle of wood about two inches thick. Through the five holes in it the flesh is 
drawn in, raising welts on the palm of the hand. Boys are sometimes ordered by the 
teacher to use the pa/matoria on other boys, and the scholar who answers the question 
another has missed is expected to paddle him. From fear of this instrument, boys often 
play truant. “I did again and again,” said one of my acquaintances.— The teacher is 
also equipped with a whip with so long a lash that he can use it without leaving his seat— 
An older person may beat a child at pleasure. One acquaintance told me he well remem- 
bered times when, having told his father he had been thus beaten, his father had made him 
carry tobacco or some other little gift to the elder who had beaten him. See JAFL 34:92.

The woman said to him, ‘You are not my son, nor the son of my 
husband. One day he [my husband] went to the spring to get 
water. He found you at a banana-tree near the spring. He 
brought you home. I could not nurse you both. He put you to 
suckle a donkey. That donkey you are so fond of that you won’t 
let a fly light on her, that donkey is the donkey that suckled you. 
You have always taken care of her as if you knew it.”! | Then 
Pedr’ said that he was going to announce that his name was not 
Pedr’, but Donkey-Son. He got a placard, he signed his name 
“Donkey-Son, the most valorous man in the world.” He went 
to the smith. He asked him to make him a sword, the strongest 
he could make. The smith made him a sword which weighed 
fifty pounds. When Pedr’ went to try it, he took and bent it. 
He said to him, “‘It is no good, I want you to make me a stronger 
one.” The smith made him another, which weighed ninety 
pounds. Pedr’ bent it too. Then the smith got all the iron-in 
that city, he made for him a sword that fifty men could not lift. 
Pedr’ took it, he swung it. He said, “This is the sword I was 
looking for. How much is it?”—“If you can use it, it will cost 
you nothing.” Pedr’ took the sword home, he stood it up in one 
corner of the house. The corner crashed down. He put it in 
each corner, all crashed down. Then Pedr’ fetched the children 
from his school. In one day they built his mother a new house,? 
a better house than what she had. His mother was pleased. 
Now she called him her son. 
Pedr’ asked his father’s consent to set out to see the world. He 
set out. The first man he met was Dundun di Sanbuna. He 
greeted him, but the man did not answer him. Pedr’ asked him 
why he did not answer. “TI have no time. I am looking for a 
man called Donkey-Son, who signs his name ‘the most valorous 
man in the world.’” Pedr’ said to him, “Don’t lose time looking 
for him. I went to school with him. I know him well. He is a 
little fellow eight years old. He knows no better, that is why 
he signed his name on the placard. But come along with me if 
you want to, I’ll show him to you.”” They went on together, they

sword on the ground, the spark flew out, a fire caught that a 
stream of water could not put out. “Well, do you want to go 
along with us?” they asked him. He said, ‘‘No, I’m looking for 
Sir Donkey-Son.”— Pedr’ said to him, ‘‘No use looking for him. 
He is not the man to compete with you. He is only a little fellow; 
but come along with me if you want to, I'll show him to you.” 
They went on, they met Raforgo Rubeira Grande. ‘Come go 
along with us!”—‘‘No, I can’t go with you. I’m looking for Sir 
Donkey-Son.”—‘“‘Oh, don’t bother yourself about him! He is a 
little bit of a fellow. But come along with us, if you want to, 
T’'ll show him to you.” 
They went on, they came to a king’s house. There they heard 
that Giant-of-Hell! had devastated the king’s garden, killed his 
vassals, and carried off his daughter. The king moved away, he 
went to live in a high place, where he could not see his devastated 
garden. It was a flower-garden from which he had sold thousands 
of dollars’ worth of flowers. From all over the world vessels came 
there to get flowers. Pedr’ said to the king, “I am going to kill 
that giant. Share the garden with us, we four will guardit. Give 
us men to work it.” The king rang his bell, a thousand men 
came. The king gave Pedr’ four oxen, four pigs, four sheep, and 
four goats. The garden had different gates, but only one which 
the giant used. Pedr’ and his three friends made a fire. They 
decided that Mouro Pé di Cabal’ would stay there to cook and to 
watch the gate. At noon Mouro Pé di Cabal’ rang the bell for 
dinner. He saw Giant-of-Hell standing at the gate. Giant-of- 
Hell said to him, “Give me fire to light my pipe.” Mouro Pé di 
Cabal’ said to him, ‘“‘I am not your servant, get fire if you want.” 
The giant got fire, then he spit in the pot of food. It turned 
black.2 Mouro Pé di Cabal’ struck at Giant-of-Hell; but Giant- 
of-Hell slapped him on the back of his neck, he dropped senseless. 
Dundun di Sanbuna said to the king, “To-morrow I’ll stay to 
cook. This man here is no man at all.” The king sent more 
food to them. At noon Dundun di Sanbuna rang the bell for 
dinner. There stood Giant-of-Hell at the gate. He said, “Give 
me a fire-stick to light my pipe.”—‘“I am not your servant, get 
fire if you want.”’ Giant-of-Hell got his fire-stick, then he spit 
in the pot. Dundun di Sanbuna struck at Giant-of-Hell; but

he slapped him on the neck, he fell senseless. The next day 
Rafotco Rubeira Grande, who was the strongest of the three, 
staid to cook. At noon he rang the bell for dinner. There stood 
Giant-of-Hell at the gate. He said, ‘Give me a fire-stick to 
light my pipe.”—“I am not your servant, get it if you want.” 
Giant-of-Hell got a fire-stick, he spit in the pot. Raforco Rubeira 
Grande struck at him; but Giant-of-Hell slapped him on the 
neck, he fell senseless. Then the king learned that Raforgo 
Rubeira Grande had also fallen senseless. The king said that he 
would take away his men from there. Pedr’ begged the king to 
leave his men, but to cut down the rations. At a quarter of 
twelve Pedr’ rang the bell for dinner. He went to the door to 
meet Giant-of-Hell. Giant-of-Hell said to him, “Give me fire 
to light my pipe.” —‘“‘I am not your servant, get it if you wish.” 
Pedr’ had several pots on cooking. When Giant-of-Hell went 
to get fire, he spit in the first. Pedr’ said to him, “You are 
not going to spit in the others.” Pedr’ drew his sword, Tres- 
Balanc’, he hit the giant with it, he split him in two.’ One half 
fell down on the ground, the other half went straight to Hell. 
His three other companions were standing off to one side, where 
they could see Giant-of-Hell coming, and could run away. When 
they saw Pedr’ split him in two pieces, they ran in; they took off 
their caps; they made the sign of the cross to Pedr’ kneeling on 
the ground; they acknowledged him; they cried, “‘Pedr’, Pedr’, 
Pedr’!”” Then he declared, “I am not Pedr’, I am that Donkey~ 
Son whom you were looking for.” 
The king said to Pedr’, ‘Go and rescue my daughter from 
Giant-of-Hell. I will marry her to you.” Over the hole into 
Hell? there was a great stone. The three followers and two 
thousand men tried to lift the stone, each time it sank deeper. 
Pedr’ said to che king, “‘Ring the bell for all your men to come to 
see me lift the stone.” He went with them all to see the stone, he 
in the middle. Then he told the people to move to one side of the 
stone. He took his sword, Tres-Balang’, he struck three times. 
The sword sank to the hilt. With two fingers he pulled it out, 
he turned the stone aside. Pedr’ asked the king to give him all 
the rope he could give, for him to reach the bottom of the hole.

The first he sent for to let down was Mouro Pé di Cabal’. He 
went, went; he met some ants, which began to bite him. He 
passed on; he went farther down, he met some dagabaga! When 
they began to bite him, he cried to the people to pull him up, as he 
could not go farther down. They let down Dundun di Sanbuna. 
He went, he met the ants; he went farther down, he met the 
bagabaga; he went farther down, he met some centipedes. They 
got on him. He cried for them to pull him up, for he could not 
go down. Pedr’ said, “You are no man!” They let down 
Raforgo Rubeira Grande. He went, he passed by the ants and 
the dagabaga and the centipedes; he passed by, he met cliffs 
clashing together with sparks of fire. He cried to them to pull 
him up, as he could not go farther down. Now it was Pedr’s turn. 
He said to them, ‘‘When you feel the rope shaking, let me down 
as fast as you can.” He passed by the ants, the bagabaga, and 
the centipedes. He said to the cliff, “Open and let me pass!” 
He passed by; he met two bulls fighting, their horns interlocked. 
He said to them, “‘Open and let me pass!” : 
The first person Pedr’ met in Hell was the king’s daughter. She 
asked him, “Creature, what brings you here? It is a place from 
which none who comes ever returns.” Pedr’ answered her, 
“With faith in God, I shall return, and I shall take you with me.” 
The princess said to him, “In a little while Giant-of-Hell will 
arrive. -He will ask you to wrestle with him. Tell him that you 
are no child. Then he will ask you to kick with him. Tell him 
that you are no horse. Then he will ask you to eat with him, he 
who eats the more to kill the other.” They ate, ate, ate, until 
Giant-of-Hell could eat no more. Giant-of-Hell said, “Now kill 
me.” _He answered, “No, never shall I kill a man for eating.” 
Giant-of-Hell said for them to fence together; and he said to 
Pedr’, ‘‘But you must not use your Tres-Balang’.” When the 
princess was telling him all the things the giant would tell him to 
do, she said to him, ‘‘When he says to you to take a sword in the 
sword-house with all the new swords there, take none of them, 
take the oldest and rustiest you see there.” The first stroke of 
the giant cut from here to Providence, but he did not touch Pedr’. 
Pedr’ swung his sword, he cut twice as far. Giant-of-Hell swung 
his sword a second time. .When he began to raise his sword, 
Pedr’ took Tres-Balang’ and struck the giant with it. He cut

ants,

off his ear. Giant-of-Hell turned to pick up his ear from the 
ground. Pedr’ said to him, “Leave it there, it doesn’t belong to 
you.” Giant-of-Hell ran away. Pedr’ returned to the princess 
He tied the princess to the rope. He made a signal to pull up.? 
They pulled her up, the three champions above there; they let 
down the rope for Pedr’. Pedr’ suspected that they might be 
false. He tied his sword,* he made a signal for them to pull up. 
They pulled it up half way, they cut the rope, the sword fell to the 
bottom of the hole and buried itself to the hilt.* 
When the princess left Pedr’, she gave him a ring of remem- 
brance. As soon as the princess gave it.to him, she became 
dumb. The three champions took the princess to the house of 
theking. They told him that Pedr’ died fighting, it was they who 
saved the princess. The king decided to marry the princess to 
Raforca Rubeira Grande and to make the others officers under 
him; but the king put off the wedding-day until the princess could 
speak, The king sent to get all the said’ to see what would make 
her speak. The said’ told him that since the princess was born 
with a ring on her finger and it was lost, she would not speak until 
it was found. 
Meanwhile Pedr’ staid at the bottom of the hole, with almost 
nothing toeat. He grew weak,— so weak that he lay on his back, 
he crossed his hands on his breast ready to die, he felt the ear of 
Giant-of-Hell in his pocket. He said, “I won’t die yet.” He 
took out the ear, he bit it. At once Giant-of-Hell appeared 
before him. He begged him, ‘‘Don’t eat my ear! After you split 
me in two, I could be with my people; but when you cut off my 
ear, they wouldn’t keep me. Give it to me, I’ll put you up on 
1 Variant: “Not a fly, male or female, passes by him,” says the princess to Pedr’. 
“How did you happen to come?” She is glad to see him, yet sorry, for her husband will 
killhim, ‘Man is born to die,” rejoins Pedr’, “or he kills me or I kill him.” ... When 
she gives Pedr’ bread and wine, he eats and eats until his stomach shines. The crumbs 
he puts into his pocket... In the old sword Pedr’ is told to take is the life of Sea-Giant. 
(Fogo.) 
2 Variant: The first princess was living with a seven-headed dragon (sicha fera, “wild 
serpent”). She says to Jon de Bengala, “Man of God, what are you doing here?” ... The 
dragon comes and says, “I smell royal blood.” ... After beating him, Jon cuts off the 
seven tongue-tips and wraps them in a handkerchief. The second princess is living with a 
snake (cobra).... The youngest sister (coude) is living with the demon with the broken 
leg. When the demon sees Jon’s cane, he shakes. He goes for his six swords, three for 
each of them. Five shine like silver, the sixth is rusty. In spite of protests, Jon takes 
the rusty sword; and every time the demon swings a sword, it shatters like glass... . 
There is no answer above to his ring,— the companions have run away,— so he summons 
the demon by biting his ear, and bids him put the four of them above ground. (San 
Vicente.)

earth. The only thing you have to do is to shut your eyes.” 
When he opened his eyes, he was up above. He drew Tres- 
Balang’ against Giant-of-Hell; Giant-of-Hell ran, he disappeared. 
Pedr’ started to walk from there to look for a place to live. He 
came to a jeweller’s house! The jeweller said to him, “I’m 
getting old. I should like a young man to live with me.” Within 
eight days Pedr’ was working in gold better than the jeweller, and 
customers liked him: On the ninth day at eight in the morning 
a servant came from the king’s house for the jeweller to make a 
ring like the ring the princess was born with on her finger. If he 
made it, he would receive two thousand dollars;? and if he did not 
make it, he would sentence him to death. The old jeweller began 
to weep. Pedr’ said to him, “Don’t weep! I will make the ring 
for you. The only thing J ask of you is to shut me up in a room, 
and give me a barrel of do/a * and a barrel of wine and the gold I 
have here. When the messenger returns at two, the ring will be 
ready.” All morning Pedr’ was singing and jumping up and 
down. When the jeweller heard him, he asked him, ‘“‘My son, 
haven’t you made the ring yet?” He did not answer him. “My 
son, haven’t you made the ring yet?” he asked him again. He did 
not answer him. He thought Pedr’ was crazy. When it was one 
o’clock, Pedr’ pulled out the ear of Giant-of-Hell, he began to bite 
it. Giant-of-Hell appeared before him. Pedr’ said to him, “I 
want you to make me a ring like that of the princess.” 4 Giant- 
of-Hell pulled ten rings like that from his pocket and gave them 
1 Variant: After Jan de Bengala leaves the three princesses at their father’s door, 
he goes to live with a blacksmith. The king announces that to the man who brings back 
his daughters he will give half his fortune and one of his daughters. Every man in the 
city makes the claim. The blacksmith is going. He asks his helper if he is not going. 
“No, I have no clothes.” Jon takes the ear of the demon. ‘‘Give me a suit of silver and 
a horse of gold.” He passes under the king’s window. The girls see him and call their 
father. Jon, goes back to his ashes at the blacksmith’s, The blacksmith returns and 
jeers at him. “While I went to the king’s house, here you lay a vile thing!” — “I can’t 
help it. I have no clothes.” — “I will lend you clothes.” — “No, I have no shoes.” 
Again he goes by the king’s house. The girls call him, but he disappears. The king has 
stationed soldiers to catch him. He goes by them like the wind. One soldier, a miser- 
able little fellow (like the Jew on this street), throws his sword at him and scratches him. 
The king announces that all the men of the city are to come to his house [to be recognized]. 
Every man tears his leg with a knife. Jon de Bengala goes in his poor and wretched 
clothes, They undress him. They see the scratch and prove it is he. The king brings 
clothes for him, and presents him to his daughters. They recognize him. He tells the 
king all he has been through. The king marries him to the youngest sister and gives him 
half his riches. (San Vicente.)

to Pedr’, Pedr’ drew his sword. Giant-of-Hell turned into a 
whirlwind, he went to Hell. He gave the ring to the servant of 
the king. He took it to. the palace! When they put it on the 
finger of the princess, she started to talk like a parrot. The next 
day they planned for the wedding. The king invited to the 
wedding the man who made the ring and who made her talk. 
The old jeweller said, “I can’t go myself, but I will send my son. 
It was he who made the ring.” The jeweller gave Pedr’ two 
thousand dollars. He told him to buy himself the finest clothes to 
- wear to the wedding. Pedr’ answered, “I don’t need the money. 
I’m going at one o'clock.” The wedding was at four. A few 
minutes before one Pedr’ pulled out the ear, he began to bite it. 
Giant-of-Hell appeared. “After you split me in two, I could still 
be with my people; but when you cut off my ear, they wouldn’t 
have me. What is it you want now?”—“I want you to accoutre 
for me a horse of gold and silver, and for myself a suit of gold and 
silver.” As soon as Giant-of-Hell gave him these things, Pedr’ 
gave him his ear. He turned into a whirlwind, he whirled down . 
to Hell. Pedr’ mounted his horse, he went to the wedding. 
When: he came near, his horse began to-dance, gold dropped in 
the road for the people to pick up. All those high personages 
went down on their knees, thinking that he was God. He raised 
them up; he said to them, “I am a man like you.” The king 
brought him coffee and food to see if he was God. He ate like 
other people. The king said, ‘‘Nevertheless, I believe he is God.” 
Only those three men did not come forward. They were strutting 
about, the tail of their shirt down to their shoes, sounding like a 
calf. They said, “We don’t care about this fellow. Whoever he 
is, he is not God.” The king took him to bless the princess at her 
matriage. Some of the hair on his forehead was white. When 
the princess saw it, she remembered him. She took off her ring 
from her finger and put it on his finger, and the ring that the 
princess had given him he took and put on her finger. At this 
they remembered each other. She groaned, she turned faint, 
she fell into his arms. Then she told the king? and queen how he 
came to her house in Hell and won the match against Giant-of- 
Hell, and fought with him and cut off his ear,— “He tied me to a

three champions cut the rope and took her home and falsely 
claimed it was they who rescued her from Giant-of-Hell. When 
the three champions heard the groans of the princess, they drew 
near. The first to come was Raforc’ Rubeira Grande. As soon 
as he saw Pedr’, he ran and jumped down through the window 
seven stories. He broke his leg. He yelled back: he said, “That 
is not God, that is Donkey-Son.” The other two heard him, 
they too jumped down through the window. They broke their 
legs. They ran into the woods, they turned into wild creatures, 
and they are still wild. They put the wedding off to another day? 
The king gave Pedr’ his crown for him torule over the land. End.

There was a woman and a man married. They lived together 
five years, they had no child. One day the man said to the woman, 
“Let us go on a pilgrimage to a church to ask for a child!” They 
went, they were seven weeks in this act of devotion. When they 
were coming back, they met an old man. “Where are you 
going?” he asked them. ‘‘We’ve just come from a pilgrimage we 
went on to ask for a child. We’ve been married five years, and 
we have no child.” Theold man pulled an orange from his bag.® 
He told the woman to eat the peel and to give the orange to her 
husband to eat. Next day the man went to work. On his 
return, the woman told him she was Pregnant. Within seven 
months a child was born. 
On the day of its birth it ate a banana. The next day it 
ate whatever its mother put on the table. The father of the 
child was well to do; but within six months the child ate up 
all he had, he could not feed it, he went to beg alms. He went 
to the king’s house, he told the servant he had come to beg alms.

The servant ran to tell the queen; but the queen did not believe 
her, because this man was their friend, they knew he was well off. 
The queen scolded the servant until she cried. The queen sent 
another servant to the door. She saw that the man was indeed 
the man they knew. The queen sent to call himin. He told the 
queen that he was begging because he had been married five years 
— ‘‘we had no child. We went on a pilgrimage. On our return 
we met an old man, he gave us an orange to share. Seven months 
later a child was born. It began to eat, eat, eat. The child ate 
so much, it set me to begging alms.” The queen sent for the 
king, they promised to bring up the child. The man said, “I 
cannot agree to give you the child at once. The child is half 
mine, half my wife’s. I want to go home and consult her.” 
When he told her, the woman agreed. He wrote to the king to 
send for the child.? 
When the child arrived, the king rang the bell in his citadel ? 
to call his people to a feast. The long table was filled with food, 
but in a short time Pév’ Minin’ ate it all up. Then the king pro- 
posed that Pév’ Minin’ join his herdsmen. Pedr’, the goatherd, 
he came to first. There he ate three goats in a day,— one for 
breakfast, one for dinner, one for supper. Finally Pedr’ wrote 
the king that the corral was cleaned out. The king wrote, 
“Send him on to Paul, the shepherd.” At Paul’s Pév’ Minin’ ate 
three sheep a day,— one for breakfast, one for dinner, one for 
supper. Paul wrote the king that the sheep were finished up. 
The king wrote, “Send him on to José, the cowherd.” When 
Pév’ Minin’ had eaten up all the cows but one breeding-cow and. 
one young bull, José sent word to the king. The king answered, 
“He is to eat them all. When he is about to come to the city, let 
me know.” When the king heard from the herdsman that Pév’ 
Minin’ was about to come to the city, he rang, he assembled his 
people. This time Pév’ Minin’ sat down at the table with them, 
he ate as they ate. 
The king had a daughter, but she had been lost for seven years. 
She was far from heaven and far from earth, down in a mine where 
no one suspected. Pév’ Minin’ told the king he was going to find.

him. After they had gone a week, they reached the mine where 
the king’s daughter was. They stopped there in a castle. Pédv’ 
Minin’ told Pedr’ to stay at home to cook while they went hunt- 
ing. When Pedr’ finished cooking, a giant arrived; he asked for a 
pipe, tobacco, and food. Pedr’ said, “I can give you a pipe and 
tobacco; but I can’t give you anything to eat, because my com- 
panions are away.”’ They began to fight, they fought and fought; 
the giant kicked Pedr’, he broke his leg. When the others came, 
they asked for something to eat; Pedr’ told them there was 
nothing ready to eat, because he went out to get wood and fell 
and broke his leg. The next day they left Paul at home to cook. 
When Paul finished cooking, the giant arrived; he asked for a 
pipe, tobacco, and something to eat. Paul said, “I can give you 
a pipe and tobacco; but I can’t give you anything to eat, because 
my companions are away.” ‘They began to fight, they fought 
and fought, the giant kicked Paul and broke his leg. When the 
others came, they asked for something to eat; Paul told them 
there was nothing to eat, because he went out to get wood, he fell

When José finished cooking, the giant arrived; he asked for a 
pipe, tobacco, and something to eat. José said, “I can give you a 
pipe and tobacco; but I can’t give you anything to eat, because 
my companions are away.’’ They began to fight, they fought 
and fought; the giant kicked José and broke his leg. When the 
others came, they asked for something to eat. José told them 
there was nothing ready to eat, because he went out to get wood, 
he fell down, he broke his leg. Pév’ Minin’ decided to stay at 
home to cook. If the others were good cooks, Pév’ Minin’ was 
still better. After he had finished cooking, the giant arrived; 
he asked for a pipe, tobacco, and something to eat. “I’m not 
going to give you a thing,” said Pév’ Minin’. He gave the 
giant a slap (on the nape of his neck). The giant turned a somer- 
sault. He got up to fight with Pév’ Minin’. They fought for 
one hour, until Pév’ Minin’ got tired. To rest he turned into an 
ant, he went under the feet of the giant. Then he turned back 
into a man, he started to fight again, he slashed with his cutlass. 
The giant begged him not to kill him. “I have a note for you to 
take to my brother.” Pév’ Minin’ took the note, he cut off the 
giant’s head. He cut up his body, he put it into a barrel. When 
his companions came, he said to them, “This is what I have for 
you to eat.” (This was his joke.)

Pév’ Minin’ got three hundred fathoms of rope to lower him 
into the mine. He got a bell too. He told his companions, 
“When I ring it, you will know I am at the bottom.” They 
lowered him half way, they let him go. He fell, he lay sick for 
seven weeks with leprosy. A woman came, and said, ““O poor 
wretched fellow!” (That was the Virgin Mary.) She made a 
reed! knife to clean his sores, within three days he was up and 
about again. He went through the mine, he went to the house of 
the giant’s brother for whom he had the note. When the giant 
read, he became wild to fight with Pév’ Minin’. Pév’ Minin’ 
fought, he grew tired, he turned into an ant to rest under the 
giant’s feet. He turned back into a man, he killed the giant. 
Then Pév’ Minin’ went to the house where the king’s daughter 
lived. She hid Pév’ Minin’ under her bed; for, if the man who 
was with her found him there, he would kill him. He was coming 
right away with thunder and lightning, wind and rain. Pév’ 
Minin’ said, ‘“‘ Well, tell him I am not afraid of any man.” When 
the man came, he said, “I smell royal blood.” Pév’ Minin’ 
jumped out from under the bed; he said, “I will draw from you 
the blood of justice.” Pév’ Minin’ fought with him, he killed 
him, he carried off the king’s daughter to the mouth of the mine. 
There he rang his bell, but he got no answer. After a while the 
woman came who had cured him of his sores. The king’s daugh- 
ter, who was half animal and half human, felt ashamed; she hid 
herself from the Virgin Mary. In an instant, before they knew 
it, they were standing on top of the earth. (The Virgin Mary 
had pulled them up.) .They went to the king’s house, and the 
king rang for all his people to come to meet them. The three 
companions had returned to the king; they told him that Pév’ 
Minin’ had been lost, they did not know where he was. The 
king asked him, ‘‘What do you wish done with these men who 
played you false?” Pév’ Minin’ answered, “I don’t want any- 
thing done to them. Send for four wild horses,— one from the 
north, one from the south, one from the east, and one from the 
west. Tie to them these three men, ring your bell, loose the 
horses, let each [horse] go his way.” The king married Pév’ 
Minin’ to his daughter. He gave him half his kingdom to rule 
over.

14. LITTLE BALD-HEADED.! 
There was a wolf with [his] nephew and Jaguar. They lived 
together. Nephew went out to get wood. He met a pregnant 
woman with a big bundle of wood. The woman called to him to 
come help her put it on her head.2 Nephew said to her, “Why 
don’t you call your husband to come help you put it on?” The 
woman heard a voice inside of her saying, ‘‘Mother, wet your 
little finger in your mouth, knock it three times on a stone, I shall 
be born, I will help you put it on your head.” When they went 
home, the child told its mother it was going to get fire in the 
house over there. “‘My son, you are born to-day, and you want 
to go and get fire in a place you don’t know!” * Little Bald- 
Headed took with him a stick and some /6/6.* He tied the /6/6 
across the road, and he went into the house. “Sir Wolf, I came 
to get fire,” he said. ‘“‘Go get fire, but don’t you look up!” 
There was meat hanging from the ceiling in the kitchen. Little 
Bald-Headed went in, he looked up, he pulled off a ham, he ran. 
Wolf saw him, he ran after him, he caught in the tied-up /6/6, he 
fells The child beat him. When Wolf came back all beaten up, 
the others, asked him, “What is the matter with you?” He 
answered, “I went to split wood, I hit my leg with the machad’.”* 
Jaguar said, “To-morrow I stay at home to cook.” The next day 
Little Bald-Headed put out the fire; he said to his mother, “I 
am going to get fire.” He took with him a stick and some /6/0,

the Slave Coast (Ellis 3 : 258). Among the Cape Verde Islanders it is said of a bald head, 
“Head bald as a tortoise [Cabeg’ pelad’ sima di tartaruga].’— The tortoise does not figure 
in the island folk-lore. The only belief about the tortoise I have heard of is the belief 
that if tortoise-eggs are seen on the shore, it will rain before the week is out. But the 
origin of menin’ pelad’ is probably not African (see JAFL 25 : 255). Compare Portugal,

he tied it up in the road again. “Mistress Jaguar, I came to get 
fire.””—‘Go get fire, but don’t you look up!” Little Bald-Headed 
looked up, he pulled down some meat, he ran out. Jaguar ran 
after him, she fell in the tied-up /o/o, the child beat her. When 
[they] came, they asked her, “ What’s the matter with you?”—“I 
went out to split wood, I hit my leg with the machad’.” Nephew 
said, “To-morrow I stay at home to cook.” Next day Little 
Bald-Headed went to the house to get fire. “Sir Nephew, I 
came to get fire.”—“‘Go get fire, but don’t you look up!” The 
child looked up, he pulled down some meat, he ran. Nephew 
ran after him, he fell in the tied-up /o/o, the child beat him. 
When he went home, he said, “The best thing for us to do is to 
move away from here. If we don’t move from here, the child 
will kill us all. We'll fill up a barrel with camoc’ ! and milk to eat 
on our way.” They gathered in their cows and goats, they drove 
them ahead. Wolf carried the barrel of camoc’ on hishead. Mid- 
way Wolf said, “I’m hungry, it’s time to eat.”? They began to 
eat the camoc’, Wolf’s spoon struck the head of the child.* He 
jumped up, he started to go, he told them that the cows ahead 
needed attention. He went, went, went. He asked Jaguar and 
Nephew, ‘“‘What size do I look?” —‘‘The size of a donkey.” He 
went, went, went. “‘What size do I look?”—‘‘The size of a 
chicken.” Then he called out, “The best thing for you to do is 
torun. Thatchild isin the camoc’.” Theystartedtorun. They 
ran themselves to death. Little Bald-Headed took their cows, 
he drove them home to his mother. He said, “This is a fortune 
which God has given me.”. Yesterday I was passing that way, 
I saw them.

16.1 KIDNAP: RIDING WOLF: CUTTING THE ROPE. 
There were two comadres. One was Ganga [a water-fowl], one 
Owl. They lived together in a little shelter. Each had a child. 
Every day one of them went for wood, and one staid at home to 
take care of the children. This day Ganga went, she left Owl at 
home. She exchariged the beds of the little ones. She covered 
up her own, she left Ganga’s little one in sight. There passed by 
an old king. He said, ‘““O Owl! how is it that you, ugly and 
sunken-eyed, have such a pretty child? Who lives here with 
you?”— Nobody, I live by myself. You are the first to pass by 
since I’ve lived here.’—“This child of yours looks more like 
Ganga than like you. If it is yours, can you not sell it to me?” — 
“Yes, gladly.” —“‘How much do you want for it? Bring it to the 
palace this evening and get the money.” 
Owl looked out and saw Ganga on the mount. She hurried off 
with the young one, she reached the palace before the hour. The 
king welcomed her, he called her in. She was nervous, she told 
the king that she was in a hurry. The king took the child to the 
princess to put gold beads around its long neck. To Owl the 
king gave over three thousand dollars. She took her money, she 
hurried home. When Ganga came home, she found Owl’s child 
in the bed of her own child. She threw the wood down on the 
ground, she flew out to look for her child. She flew till she came 
to acorral. She saw a goatherd. She sang,— 
“O herder of goats! O herder of goats! 
Can you not tell me if you’ve seen my son. 
Passing by here in the mouth of Owl?”

The goatherd said to her, ‘‘Not more than five minutes ago Owl 
passed by here with your child to sell it to the King of Bandéra.” 
She went, went, went; she met Wolf. 
“O Uncle Wolf! O Uncle Wolf! 
Can you not tell me if you’ve seen Owl 
Passing by here with my daughter Badanéla, 
To sell her to the King of Bandéra?” 
“No, Aunt Ganga, I saw no one pass by here. But, O Ganga! 
light on my back. I'll carry you to the King of Bandéra.”’ She 
was afraid; but as long as she was flying, she was free. She said 
to him, “TI can fly faster than you will run.” Wolf knew Ganga 
was hungry. He raised up his tail. He said, “Fly down here 
and take a bite.” Ganga flew down to his tail. She saw his head 
turn to his tail, she flew up. He turned quickly, he fell on his 
back like a turtle. Ganga went on her way. Near the king’s 
house she heard the sound of a pestle. The servant was pounding. 
Ganga began to cry and sing,— 
“O pounder! O pounder! 
Can you not tell me if you’ve seen Owl 
Passing by here with my daughter Badanéla, 
To sell her to the King of Bandéra?” 
She alighted on the verandah of the king’s house. She picked at 
the bell with her mouth. The king sent the servant to the door. 
This servant was the servant who was taking care of the child, 
she held the child in her arms. As soon as she saw her mother, 
she began to flap her wings. “This is my mother!”—“ This is 
my child!” The king heard this conversation, he came to the 
‘door. He said, “What is this?” Ganga said, ‘“‘This is my child.” 
The king asked her, “Didn’t Owl give you the money?” —“No, 
I didn’t see Owl, I saw only her son. I want my child.” The 
king was sorry for Ganga, he gave her her child. She went and 
made a nest for herself. From that time she staid far away from 
Owl. 
A goatherd passed with his bag? of milk, he saw Wolf lying on 
his back. He said to him, “How is it that you, a strong man, are 
lying this way on your back?” Wolf answered, “Ganga came by

bag. The legs are tied up, and over the tie-up is placed a piece of skin which is also tied.

hair.

here, she asked for news of her child, I tried to turn to eat her up; 
but she was too smart. She put me down on the ground on my 
back, as you see me. Here I’ve been for seven days without 
eating a thing.” The goatherd said, “I'd like to do you an act of 
charity, but you are too greedy. If I gave you some milk, you 
might kill me.” — “Oh, no! Sir Herdsman, give me some milk! 
Tl carry you home easily on my back.” The herdsman put some 
milk into his gourd cup! for Wolf. Wolf drank. He let the man 
get on his back. “Let’s go!” said the man. ‘‘When we reach 
the place where I want to stop, I’ll prick you on your back.” ? 
At the goatherd’s door was a hollow. When the herd pricked him, 
Wolf threw him over his head; the herdsman rolled down, he 
struck the bottom, he lost consciousness. Wolf started to go 
around to get him to eat. As he drew near, he saw the man move. . 
He called to him, “O cousin! don’t get up by yourself! wait, I will 
help you up!” But he raised up. Greediness overcame Wolf, he 
lifted his tail, he jumped. Down there lay Nephew asleep. Wolf 
fell on top of him, he woke him up. (Nephew and Wolf did not 
get on together, they were always tricking each other.) The 
herdsman was still there. He told Nephew how Wolf had thrown 
him down into this hollow. Nephew said, “I'll put you up whence 
you can reach home, but don’t let Wolf trick you again!”” Nephew 
helped the man up. Wolf was stunned by the fall. Nephew said 
to him, “Uncle Wolf, you are smart, but others are smarter than 
you,” — “Is that you, Nephew? You are lighter than me. Go 
get a rope and throw it down to drag me out!” Nephew said, 
“Yes, sir!” Nephew went to the goatherd for a rope. He gave 
him a horse-hair rope. Nephew tied one end to a purge’ra. He 
said, “Sir Wolf, when I throw down this rope, tie it around your 
neck in a running loop.” Wolf was anxious to get out, he made 
two loops instead of one. He said, “Nephew, when you feel me 
hang, pull up!” Nephew pulled him up a little way, he let go the 
slack, Wolf hung himself. Nephew went to the house of the 
goatherd. He was still recovering from his fall. Nephew told 
his wife the story of the end of Wolf. They wanted Nephew to 
stay with them as their servant. He was unwilling to stay, 
because he knew he could do better for himself in another place. 
The woman said to him, “Let’s make a contract! While my

husband is laid up, do you go to milk our goats.” Nephew was a 
man who liked milk, he agreed. Next day the woman put a 
gufong of banana in a bag for Nephew. He went to the corral, 
As soon as he arrived, he began to eat up the things he brought. 
He milked for himself. The milk that was left was not enough to - 
take to the house. He was so full, he did not give the goats any- 
thing to eat, he did not tend them. He was so full, he could not 
get to the house. When he reached the house, he was almost sick. 
The woman asked him, “Why do you look sick?” — “I have a 
stomach-ache. I couldn’t even look after the goats.” —~ “T’ll 
make you tea.” — ‘“‘No, Mistress, I want to take nothing, I want 
something to rub with.” The woman rubbed his stomach with 
oil. The more she rubbed, the more he swelled up. ‘You're 
swelling up too much. Better call the doctor.” — “No, Mistress! 
Don’t call the doctor!” (He thought the doctor would find him 
out.) But the woman called the doctor. The first thing he looked 
at were Nephew’s gums. ‘“‘This man has eaten too much. His 
gums are bleeding.” The woman said, “‘No, he has just come in 
from the corral.” The doctor said to her, “To prove it, heat some 
water and give it to him.” The woman brought water, the doctor 
poured it down his mouth. His gums stopped bleeding, he threw 
up all he had eaten. The woman said to him, “Nephew, where is 
the goats’ milk?” — “Mistress, when people go to the corral, 
they never bring milk home.” —-“‘I have customers coming for 
the milk. You have brought none back for them. Our contract 
falls through to-day.”

There was a woman who made out her stomach ailed her. She

that would cure her stomach. When he went to sea, a friar came 
to visit her. On his way to sea he met a saib’.8 The said’ said to

it to the house of his wife, where she asked for shelter for the night. 
The woman gave her shelter. She put the mat in a corner back 
of the door. Supper-time, the woman and the friar were sitting 
at the table eating. They invited the old woman to eat with them, 
afterwards to tell them a story. After supper she sang, — 
“I am a gray old woman, 
J am eating and drinking, 
I am earning forty patacas * and a dun mare.” 
The woman was pleased with the song. The friar sang, —

Next morning * the old woman took out the mat and left. Then 
the husband came out from the mat. He entered the house. 
sets out again. He wants the fish because he loves his wife dearly.... The old woman 
he meets on the seacoast tells him there is no such fish in the sea. (San Nicolao.)

The friar ran, he got. under the bed. The woman made out that 
her stomach was better, but was not yet well. The woman asked 
him if he had brought the remedy. “I have a better remedy 
than what you told me to get.” The man took a stick to push 
out the friar from under the bed. The woman asked, ‘‘What did 
you say?”—“I asked if you had anything good for me to eat?” 
The woman gave him some samp. There was a little boy who 
slept in the house. The man said, “Call the little boy, because I 
can’t eat without him.” When he asked the boy to eat, the boy 
said to him, “I don’t want to eat this food.” The man asked, 
“What do you want?”—“I want the roast beef and the wine 
which are in the cupboard.” The man asked the woman, “Have 
you got that?”—‘‘Oh, yes! I forgot about it.” After they finished 
eating, the man said to the boy, “Now tell me a story before 
you go tosleep.” The boy said, “Once my father had a lot of pigs 
which he sent me to take care of. One pig ran from the others. 
T took a stone, I hit it on the leg. I broke its leg. When my 
father came home, I told him that I broke the pig’s leg. He took 
awhip, he whipped me. I made water just like that barrel of wine 
the woman has in the store-room.” The man sent the woman 
in to get the barrel. The boy continued to relate, “My father 
whipped me again. I opened my eyes like that friar under the 
bed.” ! The man pulled out the friar. He tied him to two 
horses,— one from the north, one from the south. Then he let 
the horses loose to go to where they came from. His wife he put 
in a barrel of tar, which he set on fire. The ashes he scattered at

Little-John’s horse was no good. One day Big-John said to 
Little-John that if his horse whinnied again, he was going to kill 
it. The horse whinnied, Big-John killed it. Then Little-John 
took the skin, he curéd it. He started out to walk; he arrived at 
a house, where he asked the woman to give him shelter. The 
woman said to him, “I can’t let you come in, because my husband 
is away.” So Little-John waited outside the door. At midnight 
the husband returned. He found Little-John standing by the 
door, shivering with fear. The man asked his wife, “Why did 
you leave the fellow outside and not call him in?”—“T didn’t 
let him in because you were away.” The man told the woman to 
get supper for him and Little-John. The woman said she had 
nothing to eat but cold tea. When Little-John sat at the table, 
he put his horse-hide at his feet, he pressed his feet against it. 
He pressed, pressed, pressed. “What are you doing?” the 
husband asked him. ‘What is the skin telling you?” —“It tells 
me that if you go to the cupboard, you will find enough to eat.” 
The man went to the cupboard, he found plenty. ‘What does 
it tell you now?” he asked Little-John. ‘‘It tells me that if you 
look again, you will find wine.” The man begged Little-John 
to sell him the hide. Little-John said to him, “Yes, I will sell it 
for two quarta of money.” ‘Then he asked the man to give it 
back to him, he would show him still more. Little-John pressed 
his foot over it; he said to the man, “Go into the next room, 
uncover the barrel there, you will see what you will see.” In this 
barrel was a devil. When the man saw the devil in the barrel, 
he covered it up again; he called to Little-John to come back. 
Little-John had started, he came back again. “I’ve nothing to 
do with it. The contract is closed.”’—‘‘If you’ll only come back 
and take away what is in the barrel, I’ll give you double what is 
inside of the barrel. I'll give you double what I gave you before.” 
Little-John came back, he took the devil out of the barrel, he got 
his money. When he reached home, he sent to borrow a quarta 
to measure the money. When he sent the guarta back, two pieces 
of silver were sticking in the basket. “‘What were you measur- 
ing in the basket?” Big-John asked him. “I was measuring the 
money I got from the horse you killed,” answered Little-John. 
“You got two guarta for your little horse,” said Big-John. “My 
horses are bigger, I might get four guarta or more for them.” As 
soon as he reached home, he killed his two horses, he tied up their

skins, he put them on his back, he went into the city; he called 
out, “Who wants to buy horse-hide, raw, raw horse-hide?” He 
found no purchasers, he returned, he told Little-John that he was 
going to kill him for his lie. ‘“‘You didn’t do it right,” Little- 
John said tohim. “You took the hides raw; had you cured them, 
you would have sold them like me.’ 
Big-John said he was going to kill Little-John’s grandmother, 
He killed her. Big-John put her in a chair, he wheeled her to a 
store in town. He asked the storekeeper for something to drink. 
He turned to his grandmother; he said to her, “Grandmother, if 
you were not asleep, I’d give you to drink too.” The storekeeper 
said to him, “Why don’t you wake her up?” — “I don’t like to,” 
answered Little-John. The storekeeper went up to her, he shook 
her, she fell off the chair. Little-John said, “What have you done? 
You’ve killed my grandmother!” — “Don’t tell anybody, I’ll 
give you what money you ask for,” said the storekeeper. He had 
her buried, he gave Little-John four guarta of money. When 
he returned home, he sent to Big-John for his guarta. When he 
sent back the measure, two pieces of money were sticking to it. 
Big-John asked Little-John where he got the money. “I sold my 
grandmother.” Little-John said to him, “You see, everything 
bad you do to me turns out good. You kill my horse, it turns out 
good. You kill my grandmother — much better yet.” Big-John 
went home, he planned to kill his grandmother. “If for his grand- 
mother he gets four guarta, my grandmother being a larger woman, 
I might get eight.” After he killed his grandmother, he put her 
on his back, he went into the city; he called out, ‘Who wants to 
buy a dead body? I will sell it cheap. Who wants a dead body?” 
The authorities of the city ran after him, he dropped the body, he 
ran home. He went to Little-John; he said to him, “Little-John, 
you made‘me kill my horses, I got nothing for them. You made 
me kill my grandmother, I got nothing for her. Now I’m going 
to kill you.” He put Little-John into a sack, he put it on his back. 
As he was passing by a church with the sack on his back, he said 
to himself, “I ought to go in to ask a pardon for my sins, for the 
thing I am going to do.” He asked himself this question three 
times, he went into the church, he left the sack at the door outside. 
Just then there passed by a herdsman with a big herd of cows and 
goats. When he saw Little-John in the sack, he asked him what 
he was doing inside the sack. Little-John answered, “They’ve 
put me in the sack to throw me into the sea because I don’t want

to marry the king’s daughter. Besides, I don’t know how to eat 
with a knife and fork, J am not going to marry her.” The herds- 
man said, “I know how to use a knife and fork. You get out of 
there, let me in! Tl marry the king’s daughter.” Little-John 
let the herdsman take his place in the sack. He took the guitar 
and everything the herdsman had, and his cows and goats. He 
went home with them. When Big-John came out of the church, 
‘he found the sack lighter than it was. “The sack is light,” said 
he, “because I went into the church and got pardon for my sins.” 
He took the sack to the shore, he loaded it on a tender, he went 
out on the water, he threw it into the sea. When he went home, 
he saw Little-John passing by with his guitar and his cows and 
goats. ‘You see, everything bad you do to me turns out good. 
You killed my horses, it turned out good. You killed my grand- 
mother, it turned out even better. You put me into a sack, you 
threw me into the sea; there at the bottom of the sea I found all 
these animals.” Big-John said, “I was wrong to do all that, but 
put me into a sack and throw me into the sea. Throw me farther 
out than I threw you; farther out and deeper I can get more 
animals.” Little-John put him into a sack and took him out on 
the water.. He said to him, “This is the place to throw you into 
the sea.” —‘‘No, go farther out,” begged Big-John. He went 
farther out. He said to him, “This is the place.” — “No, go 
farther out.” — “This is the place.” — “‘Just a little bit farther.” 
Then Little-John threw the sack into the sea. He went home, he 
enjoyed his life in peace.

something in my pocket.” He saved and saved until he had saved 
up three dintem [sixty reis]. He thought, “‘What shall I do with 
this money? I'll buy a book of regulations with it. I will show 
it to my people at home, they will'see what I have learned.” He 
took. farewell of his comrades. One gave him a pipe, another 
tobacco, others gave him other presents. He went, went, went, 
until he reached a house, where he asked for shelter. The woman 
in the house said to him, “My husband is away. I can’t let you 
in, but you can go into the stable.” — “Good! What I need is 
just a cover from the sun.” He saw her putting out roast chicken, 
roast turkey, roast beef, bread and wine, on the table. There were 
two friars who used to come to her house to pass the time. After a 
while they heard some one at the gate. It was the woman’s 
husband who came from work. The woman hid the things under 
the bed and in the cupboard. She went to meet her husband. 
She laid the table for her husband with pdépa and milk. While he 
was eating, the woman told him about the man she had sent to 
the stable. The man said to her, “Had it been one you liked, you 
would have had him in here; but that poor man you sent to the 
stable.” He went out and brought in the soldier. The man 
asked him, “What do you do?” — “I am a soldier, my time is up, 
I’m on my way home.” — “Well, since you are a soldier, tell me 
some stories about your life.” — “I haven’t any stories to tell, 
but I have a little book that can divine fortunes.” — “Let it 
divine a bit.” The soldier looked into his book; he said, “Go to 
the cupboard, you will find some roast beef.” — “‘Roast beef in 
my house! No!” — “Yes, go there, you'll find it.” The man 
went, he found the roast beef. The man exclaimed to his wife, 
“With all this in the house, you don’t put any of it on the table!” 
The woman answered, “You forget it is near Easter.”! She put 
it on the table. The man begged the soldier, “Can you not make 
your book divine a little more?” — “Yes, go to that drawer, 
you’ll find a roast turkey.” The man said to him, “Divine 
again.” —“Go under the bed, you'll find a roast chicken.” — 
“Divine again.” — “Go on the other side, you'll find bread and

eat. Then he asked the soldier to sell him the book. “No, I 
can’t sell it, because, when I’m in danger, the book helps me.” — 
“Oh, sell me the book! I'll give you seven donkeys loaded with 
money.” — “I can’t sell it; but, seeing it’s you, I will sell it.” 
The soldier gave him the book, he took the loaded donkeys, he 
went his way. The man told his wife to invite all their compadres, 
comadres, and friends to come to dinner with them. “You 
needn’t build a fire.” The guests arrived. Among them was a 
compadre who had in particular the run of the house. ‘‘I don’t see 
any smoke here. If there is to be nothing to eat, I’m going home 
to eat.” The master of the house answered, ‘Have patience. 
Can’t you wait?” After the compadre had asked three times if 
there was nothing to eat, the master of the house asked them all to 
come to the table. He gave the book to the compadre. He said, 
“Read me where I’m going to get it.” Compadre read, “Present 
arms! March! Right about face! Halt!” The man said to 
him, “Stop your fooling! That book is all right. Read where 
I’m going to get it.’ Compadre read again, “Present armst 
March! Right about face! Halt!” The man took the book; 
he read, “‘Present arms! March! Right about face! Halt!’’ 
The man had a horse that could run the seven divisions of the 
world without tiring or sweating. About five o’clock he saw the 
soldier. When the soldier looked back, he saw a cloud of dust; 
he drove the donkeys off the road; he took off his hat, he put it 
over a pile of dung in the road; he knelt on the ground, making 
as if to hold the hat down. “Ei, man! have you seen any one pass 
here with seven donkeys? It’s somebody who slept in my house 
last night, he stole all my things, to my coat and trousers. He 
left me only the shirt I have on.” The soldier answered, “I know 
where he is, but you’re too tired to go after him. Give me your 
horse. I'll go myself if you’ll hold down my hat.” He held it 
down. The soldier gathered together the donkeys, he went his 
way, he left the man holding down the hat. He waited; he said, 
“T’m going to get out the bird under this hat.” He put his hand 
under the hat, he messed it in the dung He said, ‘“‘What a dis_

that could run the seven divisions of the world without tiring or

When the soldier reached home, he built himself a palace. All 
the boys in that city went to enlist, in order to get money like him. 
20. THE TABLES TURNED.) 
There were Wolf and Nephew. Both were married, Wolf to a 
pig, Nephew toa goat. Bothhadachild. Nephew was godfather 
to Wolf’s child, and Wolf was godfather to Nephew’s. They had 
goats and cattle. They took the children out with them to herd 
the animals, and left the women at home to look after the house. 
Wolf was cross with his wife, so one day he killed her. He sent the 
little boy to get wood. When he came back, he asked for his 
mother. Wolf said, ‘She is gone.” He did not want the boy to 
know he had killed her. He cut her up and cooked her well, and | 
gave the food to the boy toeat. The boy liked it, and ate, ate, ate. 
Wolf called out to Nephew, “Nephew, come to my house! I have 
something for you.” Nephew answered, “No, my wife is out. 
I am looking after the child.”. Wolf kept begging him to come, and 
finally he came. Wolf brought out the dish. He said, ‘Taste my 
cooking to-day!” Nephew liked it, and said, ‘‘Where did you get 
this? I have never tasted anything as good as this. Where did 
you get it?’ — “It is my wife. I killed her. She was always 
quarrelling with me.” Nephew said, ‘‘My wife has begun to 
quarrel with me too. Don’t say anything! I am going to kill her 
when I go home.” Nephew’s son was there, and overheard. 
Nephew went on, “Come with me, and help me kill her! She is 
washing at the brook. I'll place the machad’ over the door. When 
she comes, you help me kill her.” The little boy ran ahead, and 
went to his mother at the brook. He said, “‘Ma, don’t go home! 
Godfather had his wife to eat for dinner. I heard father say they 
would kill you. Don’t go home!” She started for home. The 
boy cried, “Don’t go home! Don’t go home!” She said, ‘““We 
will go home. He is not going to kill me.” On her way to the 
house she picked some witch beans (faba f itice’ra *) and filled a

gourd. She called out her husband. ‘‘Husband, come, see what I 
bring you!” Nephew said to Wolf, “T’ll go out and bring her in 
quickly.”” He went and met her. She gave him the beans. He 
ate, and said, “This is sweet. Where did you get it?” She 
answered, ‘“‘It is sweet because it is the blood of wild wolf.” He 
said, “Don’t say anything! I have a machad’ on top of the door. 
Wolf is in the house. When we get there, you help me kill him.” 
When Nephew went back to the house, Wolf said, “Where is she?” 
Nephew said, “Shut up! What have you to do with her? She is 
my wife.” He took the machad’ and knocked Wolf down. Wolf 
got up, he knocked him down again. Wolf got up and rushed out, 
knocking down Nephew, his wife, and the door. Nephew ran 
after him. People called out, “Run fast! Catch him before he 
reaches the shore! He is a good swimmer!” Wolf jumped into 
_ the sea,! and a shark ate him. He kicked so hard inside the shark, 
the shark spit him out. He landed. He was all scratched up, his 
back was sore. The flies bit him. 
(Variant a.?) 
There were two wolves,— one wild, one domesticated. Tame- 
Wolf was married to Goat. They had two kids. They lived 
inland in a little hut (caste/). One day Wild-Wolf came along 
shouting, “‘I am mad, mad, mad!” Tame-Wolf came out and 
said, “Are you crazy? Why do you shout, ‘I am mad’?” Wild- 
Wolf answered, “I am mad because you have married into the 
race of goats. We area race of noble blood. You have married 
into a race of small legs, a race knowing nothing, climbing cliffs 
out of reach.” Tame-Wolf became reflective. “I tell you what 
you can do,” said Wild-Wolf. ‘Kill her and eat her, and then 
marry another woman.” Goat went with the kids to the well to 
fetch water. Coming home, she met a man making calda3 She 
had a gourd, and she asked him to give her some ca/da to take to 
her husband. Tame-Wolf had Wild-Wolf hidden under the bed. 
When Goat reached home, Tame-Wolf did not move to help her 
put down her water. She said, “Get up! Help me!” He said, 
“Let me alone! I’m angry with you. You are of a race of small 
legs, climbing cliffs out of reach.”—‘‘Come, help me! I have 
something sweet for you.”—‘‘Pst! Easy, there is another fellow 
here under the bed.” He helped her down with water and calda.

He drank some, and found it good. He said, “Wait! I’m going 
to get a stick to beat Wolf under the bed, I am going to beat him 
because he came between you and me.” He called out Wild- 
Wolf and beat him to death. She pickled him. She said, “That 
is the meat for us to eat,— the meat of your enemy, one who 
came intriguing between you and me.” 
21.8 HOLDING UP THE CAVE: FATAL IMITATION: PICKING TEETH: 
THE PASSWORD: TAKE MY PLACE, 
Uncle Wolf and Nephew Pedr’ went out into the country to 
steal a pig. They took it into a cave, made‘a fire, put on the pot. 
Uncle Wolf sat on one side of the fire; Pedr’, on the other. When 
the [food in the] pot was almost cooked, Pedr’ took a little stone, 
he threw it up to the roof of the cave. As it fell down, he said, 
“Uncle Wolf, the cave is coming down on us, get up and hold it 
up!”? Pedr’ took out the pot, ate up all the food, he went off, 
he left Uncle Wolf holding up the cave.? He held it up for three 
days, then he jumped aside, he fell down, he split open his head.* 
When he came home, he asked his wife, Zabél Gongalbe, if she 
had seen Pedr’. She answered, “‘No, I haven’t seen Pedr’. You 
better leave him alone and stay home. He’ll kill you yet.”— 
“Ttis I who is going to killhim. I’m the sonof my father and the 
son of my mother. I’m going to kill him. He’s my nephew.” 
Next day in came Pedr’. He said, “Mistress Zabél, where’s 
Uncle Wolf?” Wolf had hidden himself under the bed. He told 
his wife not to tell where he was. He wanted to catch Pedr’.

Pedr’ had a large bottle of molasses which he had dumped on his 
head. When he took off his hat, Zabél Goncalbe thought the 
molasses was blood. She screamed. Wolf came out from under 
the bed. He cried out to Pedr’, ““O my son, my son! who has 
done this thing to you?” Pedr’ answered, “This is nothing, 
Uncle Wolf. I told a man to give it to me on the head with a 
machad’, which he did.” Uncle Wolf put his hand on Pedr’s head, 
then he put his fingers into his mouth. He was astounded. He 
called to his wife to get the machad’ to give it to him on the head to 
make the molasses come out. ‘“‘Give it to me! Give it to me!”” 
At her first blow she drew blood. He cried, ‘‘Give it to me again! 
Give it to me again!” She gave it to him again. She split his 
head in two. Then she went and collected teixeira-grass, balsam, 
and fedigosa, to make a plaster to cure his head. 
After his head had mended, he started out to the beach to find. 
Pedr’. Pedr’ was a fisherman on the beach. Wolf began to pick 
up snails [?] and crabs to eat. A claw stuck in Wolf’s teeth. 
Pedr’ was at the other end of the beach, where he saw Uncle Wolf; 
but, Uncle Wolf did not see him. Pedr’ came up; he said, “I’ve 
come to pull out that claw for you.” He took a pickaxe to take it 
out. “No, not with that,” objected Wolf. Then he took a crow- 
bar to takeit out. ‘No, not with that,” objected Wolf. He took 
a stick. “No, not with that,” objected Wolf. He said, “I will 
take it out with my fingers.’’— “Good!” said Sir Wolf. He took 
it out with his fingers. Wolf closed his teeth on his fingers, he bit 
out apiece. Nephew said to him, “Uncle Wolf, I came here to tell 
you where you could get something good to eat. Now you’ve 
bitten my finger, I won’t tell you.”— “O Nephew! T’ll put the 
piece back in your finger, even if I have to take a piece out of my 
own finger.” 
Pedr’ took Wolf to the end of the beach. There was a fish 
which came in and out every day when the tide flowed and ebbed, 
and which Pedr’ used to suckle. Pedr’ said to Wolf, “Say, 
‘Breast down!’ when you want to suck; ‘Breast up!’ when you 
have enough.” Wolf said, “Breast down!” He sucked. He 
said, “Breast up!” He did not let go. The tide went out, she 
went out with it. Wolf said, “Mother Horse-Fish, you are 
carrying me on a good road, rocking among the waves.” She 
took him far out to sea. Wolf said to her, “Let me go now, I 
remember Zabél Gongalbe.” Horse-Fish answered, “I haven’t 
got you, you’ve got me. Who are you?”—“I’m Uncle Wolf.”——

“TI gave you my breast, thinking you Pedr’. I like Pedr’ because 
he stays by me when the tide is low, so that the birds won’t eat 
me. This time I'll put you ashore. But don’t come again!” 
As soon as Uncle Wolf reached land, he ran home to find Pedr’. 
He asked Zabél Gongalbe, “Where is Pedr’?” Zabél Gongalbe 
answered in a temper, “Don’t ask me! Unless you leave Pedr’ 
alone, he will kill you.” But Wolf started out again to find 
Pedr’. Pedr’ was tied up because they had caught him stealing 
in a manioc-patch. Uncle Wolf asked, “‘Nephew, what are you 
doing here?” Pedr’ answered, ‘‘There’s a feast on here. They 
wanted me to eat, but I didn’t want to eat, [so] they tied me up.” 
Uncle Wolf said to him, “‘I’ll loose you, you tie me.”! He tied 
Wolf. Wolf saw them coming with a wooden bowl. He thought 
that they were bringing him something to eat, he began to jump 
with joy. ‘Pedr’ is crazy not to want those good things!” In 
the wooden bowl was a red-hot iron. They shoved it at him. 
He yelled, “It’s not me, it’s Pedr’! It’s not. me, it’s Pedr’!” 
There on a little hill stood Pedr’ playing his little drum. He 
sang,— 
“ Tundeng, my tundeng, my tundeng, my little drum! 
I tied Pedr’! 
I did not tie Wolf, 
Wolf of the burnt backsides. 
Tundeng, my tundeng, my tundeng, my little drum! 
I tied Pedr’, 
Tied Wolf, Wolf of the burnt backsides.”” 
They shoved the red-hot iron three times into him. He went on 
crying, “It’s not me, it’s Pedr’!”” Then they loosed him, he went 
home. He kept his bed for one week. He told his wife that he 
had been to a feast and got a cat [i.e., got drunk]. She made him 
a broth.

There were once a man and a woman. They hadason. His 
name was Little-John. His mother gave him to the king and 
queen to christen. Little-John was a liar. One day his people 
went out, they left him at home. A man came along; he said, ““O 
little one! where are your mother and father?” —‘‘ My mother has 
gone to dry up the sea to make a garden, my father has gone to 
break rocks to make a farm.”—‘‘O little one! give me a cup of 
water.” He went, he delayed bringing water. “O little one! 
are you not bringing me that water?”—“‘Sir, yes! Wait until 
I separate to-day’s water from yesterday’s, from the day before 
yesterday’s, because I want to give you only to-day’s water.” 
“Bring me a light for my pipe.” The boy went, he delayed. “O

mother has fire here from yesterday and the day before. I want 
only to-day’s fire, which is hotter than the rest.”—‘Little one, I 
see you tell more lies than I.” The man gave him a cow. 
He took the cow to the corral of his godfather, the king. The 
king had one bull. After several years he went to the king, he 
asked him for his cattle. The king said, “Here’s the one cow 
which belongs to you.” The boy said, “Sir, yes, godfather!’’ 
He took his cow, he drove her home. The king had a very pretty 
tree at his door. One night the boy climbed up on the tree with a 
machad’. He started to cut the branches. The king heard the 
machad’ singing. He said, “No doubt it is you, Little-John.”— 
“Sir, yes, godfather! It’s me, Little-John.”-——‘‘What are you 
doing on top of that tree?” —“‘Sir Godfather, I am cutting branches 
to cook soup for my father, who has given birth to a child.”—““O 
donkey! when did you ever hear of a man bearing a child?” — 
“Yes, sir! just as your bull has given birth to all your cows, so my 
father has borne a child.” The king said, “Go take all the cattle, 
take them home with you!” 
The next day at dawn he was back in the garden of the king, 
with all his cattle. “Hei, my cows! Hei, my cows!” The king 
heard him calling; he cried out, ‘No doubt it’s you, Little-John.”

—“Sir, yes, godfather! It’s me, Little-John.” The king said, 
“To-morrow I’m going to have you thrown to the bottom of the 
sea.” Little-John went home, he told his mother to kill the 
oldest cow, to cut it up in four quarters. “Cook it in salt water, 
—half water, half salt. When my four executioners pass by, 
give each of them a quarter to eat on the road.” His mother did 
all this. After they had eaten, they felt thirsty. They said, 
“If we knew where there was water, no matter how far, we'd go 
get it.” Little-John said, “Cut a little hole in this sack, through 
which I can point my finger, and Ill show you where there’s 
water.” After they cut the hole, Little-John pointed in each 
direction,— north, south, east, and west. The men put the sack 
on the ground, they went to look for the water. Just then there 
came along a rich man, with all his wealth, [going] from one city 
to another. The boy heard him pass; he cried out, ‘No, sir! 
I am not going to get married! I am not going to get married!” 
The man asked, “Who are you inside this sack?”—“‘Sir, it is me, 
Little-John.”—“What are you doing here?”—‘My godfather 
king has put me in this sack to have me thrown to the bottom of 
the sea because I don’t want to marry his daughter. I don’t 
want to marry her.” The man said to him, “Get out of that 
sack, and let me get in! Take all these things for yourself!”— 
“Sir, yes. When the executioners come back, just cry out, ‘I 
want to get married, I] want to get married!” When the exe- 
cutioners came back to pick up the sack, the man cried out, “I 
want to get matried! I want to get married!” but they paid 
no attention to him, they threw the sack into the sea. A week 
later the boy passed by the king’s house with all his riches. The 
king asked, “O Little-John! where did you find all those riches?” 
—‘O godfather! when the executioners threw me into the sea, 
I found these riches. But they threw me into shallow water; 
had they thrown me into greater depths, I should have found 
greater riches.”—“O Little-Jobn! put me into a sack and throw 
me into the sea.” A week later Little-John put the king into a 
sack and threw him into the sea. A week later the queen, who 
was left alone, said to Little-Jobn, “Little-John, your godfather 
stays away a long time.”——“‘Yes, Lady Godmother, my god- 
father is gathering together all the riches of the world to bring 
home.” But the queen suspected her husband was dead. She 
put Little-John in a house which she planned to set on fire. The 
queen’s son passed by. Little-John heard him; he said, “I don’t

want to eat all this white sugar, and pears, and chestnuts, and 
nuts.” The queen’s son begged, “O Little-John! let me in!’” 
Little-John let him in, he fastened the door. He went home. 
Then the queen set the house on fire. She burned her son to 
death. The next day Little-John passed by the palace. The 
queen said, “No doubt it is you, Little-John; but I burned the 
house you were in.”—‘Yes, Lady Godmother! You set fire to 
the house, but you burned your own son.” She cried, “Agué 
del rei!”! She threw Little-John down a trap-door until she 
could send [some one] to throw him into the sea. There he 
mined a tunnel to his mother’s house, he escaped. Then he passed. 
by the queen’s house. ‘“‘No doubt it is you, Little-John!”— 
“Yes, Lady Godmother! It’s me, Little-John.” The queen 
said, “I see I can do nothing with you.” Then the queen gave 
him the crown of his godfather. He sent for his mother and 
father to come to live at the palace. There they live to this day. 
23. EGGS OR BEANS.? 
A wolf was going to embark for another country. The steamer 
was leaving at seven o’clock. He went to an eating-place, he told 
the woman to fry him twelve eggs. When the eggs were cooked, 
it was ten minutes of seven. He ate only a mouthful, he ran for 
his boat. When the woman came, she found him gone. 
Wolf was a worker. In the new country he made fifty dollars a 
month. Then he ran a store, he made millions and millions. He 
sent for one of his sons to come and work for him. He became so 
rich, he didn’t work any more. After twelve years he returned 
to his own country with thirteen thousand dollars. He went to 
pay the woman for the eggs. He thought to pay the woman a 
thousand dollars. Nephew was eating in this house. The woman 
asked him if he knew a man called Mr. Wolf. The woman told 
him how he came there one day, asked for twelve eggs, ate only a 
mouthful, and left without paying her. Nephew said to her, “Let 
us count what twelve eggs in twelve years would come to!” They 
made out it would come to seven thousand chickens at twelve 
thousand dollars. Then Nephew went his way. Wolf came in, 
1 Under serious circumstances, any one might thus call on the king, and people within 
hearing would come to his relief. Were a woman who was being beaten by her husband 
thus to cry out, the man would stop beating her. See p. 202.

he greeted the woman, did she not know him? The woman did 
not know him. ‘Don’t you remember a man who was here twelve 
years ago and ordered twelve eggs, and ate only half an egg and 
left for the boat?” The woman said, “Oh, yes! now I remember 
you.” He put one thousand dollars on the table for the woman. 
The woman refused to take it. The woman gave him the bill. 
Wolf began to figure it out. The bill increased to so much, he 
could not figure any more. The woman took him to the judge to 
get justice. Wolfwassad. Wolfhada friend called Demon. He 
went and told him the whole story. The judge sent for Wolf, he 
showed him the bill. “Are you going to pay it or not?” asked the 
judge. Wolf began to tremble with fear, he could not speak. “Have 
you a lawyer? You must look for a lawyer, or I shall send you to 
prison for life.” Wolf went out, he met Demon. He told him all 
that passed. Demon said, “Go tell the judge you have a lawyer. 
Tam your lawyer.” The judge told Wolf to return with his lawyer 
the next morning at nine o’clock. At nine Demon did not appear. 
Wolf began to tremble again. The judge said to him, “You ought 
to be shot for saying you have a lawyer when you have none.” 
At half-past eleven Demon arrived, late. ‘“‘Are you the lawyer — 
for that rascal? Is this the time for you to come to court?” 
Demon said, “I am late because my servant was cooking some 
beans to plant.” The judge said to him, “Say that again.” — 
“T am late because my servant was cooking some beans in order 
to plant them.” The judge said, “I never heard of such a thing, 
that the day beans were cooked they sprouted.” Demon answered, 
“As cooked eggs hatch out chickens, so cooked beans sprout.” 
Wolf took the thousand dollars he would have paid the woman. 
He went his way, a freeman. The judge sent the woman to prison. 
Wolf said to Demon, “I will work for you the rest of my days.” — 
“Tam your old friend,” Demon said to him; “call on me whenever 
you need me.”

(THE SHELTER SHAKES): MOCK BLOOD AND BRAINS: TELL-TALE 
GREASE. 
There was an old man with an old woman with an old basket. The 
old man was putting his foot in and out. The old woman was putting 
her footin and out. From here on what it is, he knows [?].? 
There was a wolf. He came to town to arrange to be married.? 
He told Nephew how he was going to get married, and at what 
house he had arranged to marry. The next week Nephew came to 
town to this house. Nephew told the girl what kind of a man 
Uncle Wolf was. ‘“‘He isn’t a man fit for you to marry. To 
prove it to you, I will ride him into town. I will fire off a gun asa 
signal for you.” Nephew knew that Uncle Wolf liked fresh meat. 
Nephew killed a pig, he hung up the meat in the house. Then he 
sent for Uncle Wolf to come and see him. Before Wolf came, 
Nephew tied a piece of pork to his leg with a rag. When Wolf 
came, Nephew said to him, “I have stored all the meat I need for 
this year. I want to see the doctor to stop this meat from coming 
out of my foot. I'll give you five pounds of meat if you will carry 
me to see the doctor.” * Uncle Wolf agreed. “I'll give you five

pounds more if you'll let me put a saddle on you.” Uncle Wolf 
agreed. “I'll give you five pounds more if you'll let me put on a 
bridle.” Uncle Wolf agreed. “‘I’ll give you five pounds more if 
you'll let me put stirrups on you, with spur.” Uncle Wolf agreed. 
When they were ready, Nephew got down his gun from over the 
door. Uncle Wolf asked, “What are you going to do with it?” 
Nephew answered, “If we see any chickens on our way, we can 
shoot them, we'll eat them.” When they came to the place 
to shoot, Nephew shot. He told Uncle Wolf, “I’ve shot two 
bears.!. I know where they fell, we'll get them when we come 
back.” Uncle Wolf said, ‘Good boy! Mark the place well, so 
we can get them on our return.” When they were near the girl’s 
house, Nephew spurred Wolf so hard, he jumped over the gate; 
he landed inside the girl’s yard. Off got Nephew, he tied Uncle 
Wolf to a fig-tree. The people of the house had dinner ready, the 
table was set where they could see Wolf standing in the yard. 
Nephew said to her [the girl], “Take some bones, throw them down 
in the yard, you’ll see what Uncle Wolf is like.” The girl threw 
out the bones, Wolf grabbed them. When she hollered at him, 
Wolf pulled, he broke his rope, he ran off. 
Wolf ran off, he went home; he said to his mother, “I am going 
to kill Nephew. J am going to build a shelter? near the road 
Nephew takes every day to go to milk his cows. There I am going 
to kill [my] nephew.” The next day Nephew passed that way, he 
noticed a shelter he never saw before. He said to himself aloud, 
“Shelter, you are a shelter. If there is anything to steal in that 
shelter, the top of it will shake.” Wolf, who was inside the 
shelter, gave a shake to the top. Then Nephew took out his 
strike-a-light,? he struck a light, he set fire to the shelter. 
Wolf escaped, he ran home. He told his mother how Nephew 
set fire to the shelter. He said, “But I’m going to settle him 
yet!” His mother said to him, “You better let the boy go. You 
can’t settle him.”” Nephew knew that Uncle Wolf was after him. 
He sent word to Wolf for them to meet and fight, to put an end to

the question forever. Wolf agreed. Nephew took two gourds: 
one he filled with the blood of a kid; the other, with clotted milk. 
Uncle Wolf was bigger and stronger than Nephew. They fought, 
fought, fought. Nephew felt that Wolf was going to beat him; 
he took the gourd of blood, with it he gave it to Wolf; he called 
out loud, “Uncle Wolf, you take care, you’re bleeding a great deal! 
You may die before you finish this fight!” Uncle Wolf rubbed 
his hand on his face, he saw the blood. He said, “That is nothing; 
I am going to kill you, anyhow.” Nephew took the other gourd, 
with it he gave it to him; he said, “Uncle Wolf, you better take 
care, because this is brain now coming out!”! Wolf rubbed his 
head with his hand, he looked at it; he said, “My nephew, get a 
rag and tie up my head. Take me home. [I'll never fight you 
again.” Wolf reached home; his mother washed his head, she 
saw that his head was sound. “You're a fool, my son, to keep 
at this boy.” 
Mr. Wolf and his mother moved to another part of town, where 
there was no drinking-water. They had only salt meat to eat. 
They got thirstier and thirstier, until Mr. Wolf could not eat any 
more of the salt meat. Meanwhile Nephew found a spring. 
Every day he ran there to drink, and he ate well every day. One 
day Uncle Wolf followed Nephew, he found the spring. At the 
spring there was a big rock, behind the rock Nephew was hiding. 
Wolf began to drink, Nephew from behind the rock began to give 
it to him with a switch.2 Uncle Wolf looked all around, he saw 
nothing. He said, “It is this hat, perhaps, that keeps me from 
drinking.” He threw away the hat. He started to drink again, 
Nephew gave it to him with the switch. “‘It is my coat, perhaps, 
that does not let me drink.” He took off his coat, he threw it away. 
He started to drink again, Nephew gave it to him with the switch. 
“Tt is my trousers, perhaps, that do not let me drink.” He took 
off his trousers, he threw them away. He started to drink again, 
Nephew gave it to him with the switch. ‘“‘It is my shirt, perhaps, 
that does not let me drink.” He took off his shirt, he threw it 
away. Now, naked, he started to drink again. Again Nephew 
switched him. He ran home; he told his nephew, “I found a 
spring, but something in the spring did not let me drink.” Nephew 
said to him, “I tell you what todo. Go to the king’s house, where 
there are a lot of ducks. Do you ask the king for a duck, you take

it, you put it in that spring. It will kill that thing, you can drink 
the water.” Wolf went to the king’s house. He said, “Sir King, 
there is a spring where I want to drink, but a thing in the spring 
will not let me drink. I want you to give me one of your ducks 
to kill that thing.” Sir King gave him a duck. When Mr. Wolf 
was carrying the duck to the spring, Nephew ran ahead, he hid 
behind the rock. Wolf threw the duck into the spring. Nephew 
stretched out his hand from behind the rock, he seized the duck by 
the throat, he choked it. Uncle Wolf saw the duck shaking its 
wings; he said, “Thus my ducky duck catches hold, you will 
kill that thing.” When the duck was dead, Uncle Wolf called out, 
“Ducky duck kills that thing, that thing kills ducky duck too!” 
Then Uncle Wolf drank. 
Wolf came home; he told his nephew, “Ducky duck kills that 
thing, that thing kills ducky duck too. Now, what am I to do?” 
Nephew answered, “The best thing I know for you to do is to 
cook the duck well and leave it in the fireplace over the fire. You 
lie down, you sleep, at the same hour Sir King will be asleep too; 
. the hour you wake up, Sir King will wake up too. Take the duck 
to him; tell him that ‘duck killed the thing, the thing killed duck 
too,’ and you saw the best you could do was to cook the duck and 
bring it to him.’ Wolf cooked the duck, he lay down to sleep. 
Nephew took the pot with the duck from the kitchen, ate it all up, 
he left only some grease. He rubbed grease around his Uncle 
Wolf’s mouth, he stuck a bone into his teeth. Wolf woke up, he 
went straight to the kitchen, he did not find the duck. He said 
to his nephew, “You are going to tell me what has become of this 
duck.” — “Uncle Wolf, you ate it in your sleep, you didn’t know 
it!” Rage seized Mr. Wolf. Nephew said to him, “Rub your 
hand on your mouth, you will feel the grease. Don’t you see that 
bone sticking in your teeth?” — “‘Now, what am I going to tell 
the king?” asked Mr. Wolf. “Best tell him the truth,” ? answered 
Nephew. Wolf went to the house of Sir King; he said to him, “I 
threw the duck into the spring, the duck killed that thing, that 
thing killed the duck too, I thought the best thing I could do was 
to cook it. I left it in the fireplace, I lay down, I slept, I ate it in 
my sleep, I did not know what I did.” The king sent Wolf into 
the desert. That’s why Wolf lives in the desert, where there are 
no people, because he is not people [human].

25.1 WOLF’S NEPHEW MAKES WOLF HIS HORSE: “WOLF’S A GOOD 
SWIMMER.” 
There was a wolf and Nephew. There was famine in the land, 
they were looking around to get something to eat. Sir Wolf 
reached the king’s house the day the king was marrying off his 
daughter. It was three days Sir Wolf had nothing to eat. At 
the king’s house he started to cry. The king asked, “What’s 
the matter with you?” He answered, “I’m not crying for my- 
self, I’m crying because your daughter is going to ride on a pack- 
saddle.” (In those days there were no skin [leather] saddles, 
there were only pack-saddles [of straw].) Wolf said, “I know 
how to make saddles.” The king said to him, “Good! I’ll put off 
the day of the wedding. I’ll give you a week to make saddles 
for us all.2. You can go into my storehouse,? and make up all the 
skin which is there into saddles.” Wolf said, “All right! PI 
make it all up in a week.” Every day for a week they passed 
in through the window of the storehouse three buckets of water 
for Wolf, every day Wolf ate the skin and drank the water. On 
the seventh day, when the king went into the storehouse, he found 
only a cow’s tail. 
He planned again, he fixed the day for the wedding. He 
invited Nephew to be the padrinh’ di casament’,* for he knew that 
Nephew would invite his Uncle Wolf to come with him. Wolf 
would fall into his hands, he would get a chance to beat him for

2 Everybody who can, rides to a wedding. Alongside the horse or donkey of the bride 
walks a siribero (Por. estribo, “stirrup’’) to help her off at the church. 
3 Tilhad (Cab’ Verde); casa de manteng’ (Fogo). 
4 He is the best friend of the groom or the groom’s father. Usually he is the man who 
has carried the proposal of marriage (by letter in San Anton, by word of mouth in Fogo) 
to the bride’s parents or god-parents. He must be a person of some position in order to 
get recognition from the bride’s family. If his proposal is accepted, he receives from the 
girl’s father a present (prente), something he keeps as a souvenir. (Fogo.) — The festa 
di casament’ is always held in the house of the padrinh’ di casament’, and it is he who calls 
for the bride to escort her to the church. His wife, the madrinh’ di casament’, is escorted 
to the church by the groom. The two couples stand up together, facing the altar,— bride, 
padrinh’, madrink’, groom. Then the priest leads the bride to the place of the madrink’, 
who takes her stand in the place of the bride. In the beginning of the ceremony the priest 
puts the clasped right hands of the couple through a loop of his stole, to remain thus 
through the ceremony. For this archaic rite in New Mexico, see Dumarest, 148 (note 1). 
On the wedding-day the bride is supposed to hang her head and not talk. To show 
respect, she must act as if she were ashamed. People do not like her to act otherwise. 
(Brava.) — The bride is supposed not to be tearful. If she weeps, it is a sign the couple 
will not enjoy a 4om vid’ (good life). (Fogo.) —See JAFL 34 :93-94. The bride’s dress 
js given to her by the groom, or it may be by her own godfather or godmother.

his theft. Nephew invited Wolf. “There is no one to go with 
me but you, Uncle Wolf. You are my uncle.” Wolf said to him, 
“T can’t go. I stole from the king all his skins. I ate them up. 
I’m not going to his house.” !_ Nephew said to him, “‘ You better 
go. The king isarich man. He will not bother about the skins. 
He’s forgotten about it.” Wolf said, “Good! I'll go with you; 
but I have to go as your horse, so the king won’t know me. The 
only thing I ask of you is not to forget me when you get there, 
send me out a bucket full of bones.” Nephew agreed, he started 
to put a pack-saddle on Uncle Wolf. Wolf objected, “Don’t put 
that on, I don’t like it!”——“But every one has a saddle on his 
horse. If I don’t put one on you, Sir King will know you.” 
After Nephew put the saddle on Wolf, he started to put the bridle 
in Wolf’s mouth. “Don’t put that thing in my mouth! I can’t 
eat with that thing in my mouth.” Nephew said to him, “I’ll 
take it off when we get there.”—“‘Well, put it in!” After that 
Nephew started to put on a spur. Wolf objected, “I don’t like 
that thing, it will rip up my belly, I won’t be able to eat any 
more.” Nephew said, “I won’t prick you with it. Every one 
puts on aspur. If I don’t put it on, it will look bad.”—‘ Put it 
on, then; but if you use it on me, I'll kill you when we get home.” 
Wolf was a good runner. When Nephew tightened up his rein 
and gave him the spur, he ran on so fast that in fifteen minutes he 
was at the king’s house. Nephew tied him to the foot of a tree at 
the street door. The other people came up; Wolf started to dig 
up the ground, that they might think him a horse. Then the 
servants began to pass by with food. Sir Wolf begged, “Give 
me something to eat, give me something to eat!” The servants 
answered, “We are going to tell Sir King that there is a horse 
here talking.” Sir Wolf answered, ‘‘No, no! don’t say any- 
thing!” But they told the king, the king loaded his gun, he shot 
Wolf through his eye. At this Wolf pulled back on the rope, he 
broke the rope, he ran off. 
When the marriage was over, the king gave Nephew twenty 
cows. Nephew took them out to pasture. Within six months 
he had thirty head. His pasturage was very small, he moved to 
another place where Wolf happened to be. When Nephew saw 
Uncle Wolf, he called out, “Uncle Wolf, I’ve been looking for you! 
\ Variant: At the wedding-feast of the king’s daughter, Wolf steals meat from the 
meat-house. Nephew tells on him, and the king promises Nephew three milch-cows if he 
will bring in Wolf. Nephew plays sick, and gets Wolf to carry him in to the wedding-feast.

Here are the cattle the king has sent out to you since you left 
before the wedding. That shot was not for you, it was a wedding- 
shot.” 1—‘Very well,” said Sir Wolf, ‘“‘now you are my cowherd, 
and I am the master. T’ll give you one out of every thirty for 
you to milk for yourself.’ (All thirty had calves.) So greedy 
was Wolf, that he had sucked all his twenty-nine cows before 
Nephew began to milk his one cow. Wolf begged, “Give me that 
cow of yours to milk, to-morrow Pll give you two cows.” Nephew 
was afraid of Wolf, he gave him his cow. Next day Wolf gave 
Nephew two black cows; but before Nephew began to milk them, 
Wolf had finished milking his own cows; he said, “‘My nephew, 
give me those black cows of yours, because black-cow milk is very 
sweet, to-morrow I’ll give you three.” Next day Wolf gave 
Nephew three white cows; but before Nephew began to milk 
them, Wolf had finished milking his own cows; he said, ‘‘Nephew, 
give me those white cows of yours, because white-cow milk is just 
like cream. To-morrow I'll give you four.” Nephew said to 
him, “For three days I have had nothing to eat. I’m hungry. 
I won’t give them to you.” Wolf answered, “All the cows are 
mine.” He beat Nephew. 
Nephew ran away to a hill, Sir Wolf began to suck the white 
cows. Then Nephew yelled out, “If you are looking for that 
blind horse, you'll find him down there at the brook, milking a 
white cow!” Wolf stopped sucking, he looked up. He called 
out to Nephew, ‘‘Is it that king asking for me?” Nephew did 
not answer him, but yelled again, “Run, run, if you want to 
catch him! He’s a runner. If you don’t run fast, you won’t 
catch him!” Wolf left the cow, he started to run. Nephew 
shouted again, “Better run fast! If he gets to the sea down there, 
you'll lose him! He’s a good swimmer, you won’t be able to 
catch him in the sea!”’ Wolf ran down to the beach. He could 
not swim, but he heard what Nephew said, he thought he could 
swim, he jumped into the sea, he drowned.2, Nephew came down 
from the hill, he took those cows, he took the cows for himself.*

see anybody. ; Nephew whistles again. Wolf turns his head, he does not see anybody, 
he goes on eating. Nephew whistles again. Wolf sees nobody. He says, “This thing is 
with me,” Nephew calls out, “Look out, it’s with you!” He calls ‘again, “You can’t 
get him if he goes to the sea!_He’s a good swimmer!”” Wolf cannot swim, but he runs 
to the sea. Nephew calls, “If he dives, you can’t get him!” Wolf dives and is 
drowned. (Boa Vista.)

There was a wolf. He begged God to give him the means to buy 
a cow for him to mix milk and corn-husks to eat. And when he 
had it, Nephew wanted to take the cow from him. That day he 
saw him under the cow, milking. He told Sir King to run with his 
vassals, because there he was milking under the cow. Then he 
lifted his head; he said, ‘‘You cannot be like me, talking,? my 
cows that I asked the Lord for to give me that I might eat with my 
corn-husks.” He turned under again to milk. Nephew said 
again, “‘O Sir King! send all your vassals to run after him.” He 
got up, he ran. He told Sir King to run, because he had the habit 
of running straight into the sea. He ran, he struck the sea, he 
plunged in. Nephew staid with the cow.

There was a woman had three sons. When she was dying, she 
called them. “Come here, my sons! I’m going to die,” she said 
to the eldest two sons, “I want you to do whatever your youngest 
brother bids you.” * Then she died. The boys lived with their 
grandmother. One day, Jodo, the eldest, said to the others, “‘Do 
you two go out to cut wood. I’ll stay at home and make grand- 
mother something to eat.” Frigajonsi’ said, “I’m going to stay 
in to him, the king gives Nephew three cows in remuneration. Wolf takes these cows away 
from Nephew arid starts to milk them. Nephew goes up on a hill and calls out, “It isn’t 
me milking your cows, it’s Uncle Wolf! Run fast! He’s a good swimmer!” Instead 
of drowning, Wolf is caught by a horse-fish (peixe caballo), and there follows the sand-plug- 
ging episode (see p. 314).

Don’t you remember that our mother told us before she died to 
listen to him?” Jodo and José went out, and Frigajonsi’ staid at 
home. Hecooked some mush (pépa),! and he cooked it ashard as a 
rock. He called, “Get up, grandmother! you’re weak from lack of 
food, eat this mush!” —“‘O my son! I can’t eat this food.” — 
“Shut up, grandmother! you better eat it.” She began to eat it 
slowly; Frigajonsi’ took a cook-spoon, he shoved the mush down 
her throat, he choked her, she died. Then he stood her up behind 
the door, in her mouth he put a pipe.2 As the two brothers were 
returning home, they saw the old woman standing beside the ‘door. 
“Our grandmother is good yet, she will cook for us still,” one said 
to the other. Joao began to carry inside his bundle of wood;3 
' his hand knocked against the old woman, she fell over backward. 
Frigajonsi’ cried, “You’ve killed our grandmother!” Jodo said 
to him, “Well, do you come and bury her.” Frigajonsi’ said to 
him, “You killed her, you want me to bury her!” He wrapped 
her up in a mat,‘ he started out with her. His two brothers fol- 
lowed him. ‘They came to a house where there wasa feast. Friga-

Frigajonsi’ asked him, “Good night, how goes your feast?” He 
answered, “Well, but we are short of meat.” — “I have a pig over 
there I can sell you. I will sell it to you for twenty dollars.” The 
man gave him the money. He went his way. When the man 
found the dead woman in the mat, he called after Frigajonsi’.

they take him along. (San Nicolao.)

Frigajonsi’ and his brothers went on. After a while they came 
to a manioc-patch. Frigajonsi’ began to hoe; when he reached 
the side of each row, he pulled up a piece of manioc to eat. His 
brothers said, “We can do that too. As it doesn’t kill him, it 
won't kill us.” They weeded the manioc-patch, and they ate 
manioc until late. That night Wild-Giant came. He asked 
Frigajonsi’, ““Who sent you to weed my manioc-patch?” — “‘No- 
body, I saw it needed weeding, the owner must pay me for my 
work.” Wild-Giant said to him, “I’m not going to pay you.” 
—“Yes,” insisted Frigajonsi’, “you have to pay me.” — “Very 
well. Take this note to my house, you'll get your money there.” - 
In the note he told his wife, “Here are three thieves whom I 
caught in my manioc-patch. Kill them, cook them to serve for 
supper. I will bring my compadre home to supper.”! Jodo took 
the note. Frigajonsi’ said to him, “Give me the note.” Joao 
refused to give it, but Frigajonsi’ insisted. José said, “Jodo, give 
ittohim. Remember what our mother told us.” Frigajonsi’ knew 
how to read, the others did not know how. “Listen to what the 
giant has written about us: ‘Take these three manioc thieves, kill 
them, cook them to serve for supper. I will bring my compadre to 
supper.’” Frigajonsi’ said, “I’m going to write another note. 
‘My wife, here are three men who have been working in my 
manioc-patch. I want you to kill our best calf and give them a 
good supper. When they go to bed, cover them with my spread ? 
of seven stripes.’” When the woman read the note, she killed 
the best calf for their supper, sent them to sleep under the spread 
of seven stripes. When the giant came home, he said to his wife, 
“How is it? Have you killed the thieves?” She showed him the - 
note. ‘‘Now they will kill me, unless I kill them to-night.” 
Wild-Giant had three daughters. They went to bed, each of 
them wore ared cap*onher head. Frigajonsi’ got up, he put them 
[the caps] on himself and on his brothers. Wild-Giant sharpened 
his sword, he came, he saw the red caps on the heads, he thought 
they were his daughters, he passed them by, he cut off the heads of 
his three daughters. The boys slipped out; Frigajonsi’ called

to Wild-Giant, “Ei, Wild-Giant! I stole your manioc, I made you 
kill your calf for my supper, I made you give me your spread of 
seven stripes for my bed, now I have made you kill your three 
daughters! Next time I will kill you!” Wild-Giant said to him, 
“Tl settle you!” Frigajonsi’ said, “I'll settle you first!” ? 
The three brothers went on, they came to the king’s house. The 
king made Frigajonsi’ flower-gardener, and his brothers pigherds. 
The two became envious of Frigajonsi’. They said to the king, 
“Do you know what Frigajonsi’ is boasting? He says he is able 
to bring you the horse of Wild-Giant.” The king asked Friga- 
jonsi’, “‘Frigajonsi’, your brothers say you say you are able to bring 
me the horse of Wild-Giant.”?— “I didn’t say it; but if my 
brothers said so, I said so too.”* He went to where the giant kept 
his horse guarded by seven companies of soldiers. Frigajonsi’ 
watched them until they slept. Then he jumped on the horse, 
he set spurs to it, he escaped the shots of the soldiers.‘ 
Next morning his brothers said to the king, “Do you know 
what Frigajonsi’ is boasting? _ He says he is able to bring you the 
spread * of Wild-Giant.” The king said to Frigajonsi’, “Friga-

changes the silver caps (Jarefa) of the king’s daughters for the gold caps he and his

parrot calls out; Father Giant pursues, and calls to Piquinh’, ‘When you come to my

jonsi’, your brothers say you say you are able to bring me the 
spread of Wild-Giant.”—“I didn’t say it; but if my brothers said 
so, I said so too.” This time Frigajonsi’ started later, he arrived at 
the door of the giant, he turned into acat. He mewed at the door. 
The wife of the giant said to him, “It is our lost cat mewing.” 
The woman opened the door, she let him in, and gave him some- 
thing to eat. Wild-Giant and his wife went to bed, they covered 
themselves with their spread. The cat went to the side of the 
bed where the wife lay sleeping, she pulled the spread off Wild- 
Giant. Wild-Giant said to his wife, “Don’t pull off the spread!” 
He went to sleep again, the cat pulled the spread again. “‘I told 
you not to pull the spread. If you pull it again, I'll throw it down 
in the middle of the house!” The cat pulled it again. Ina rage 
the giant rolled up the spread, he threw it down on the ground. 
The cat snatched it up, she turned to go. As he reached the door, 
the parrot called out, “Wild-Giant, don’t you know that Friga- 
jonsi’ has taken your spread and has gone with it?” The giant 
yelled to him, “I'll settle you yet!” Frigajonsi’ answered, “T’ll 
settle you first!” 
Next day in the morning his brothers said to the king, “Don’t 
you know what: Frigajonsi’ is boasting? He says he is able to 
bring you the parrot! of Wild-Giant that divines for him.” The 
king said to Frigajonsi’, “Frigajonsi’, your brothers say you say you 
are able to bring me the parrot of Wild-Giant that divines for 
him.”— “TI didn’t say it; but if my brothers said so, I said so too.” 
When Frigajonsi’ reached the house of Wild-Giant, he and his 
wife were out. Frigajonsi’ hid in a dark corner. Wild-Giant 
and his wife came home, they went to bed. Frigajonsi’ came out, 
he started to lay hold of the parrot.2. The parrot said to him, 
“Take your hand away, nigger hand, I will not keep it, Friga- 
jonsi’.””. Wild-Giant said, “Parrot, don’t utter that name in my 
house! If you utter that name again, I will get up, I will kill 
you!” Frigajonsi’ stretched his hand out again to catch him. 
The parrot said to him, “Quiet, quiet, Frigajonsi’, quiet!” * 
Wild-Giant got up, he discovered that it was Frigajonsi’. “O

if you mention that name again, I will cut off your head.” Jon lays hold of Parrot, who 
says not a word. ‘‘Jon Picaninh’, you made me kill my three daughters, you stole my

you rascal! I’ve got you now!” He tied up Frigajonsi’, he gave 
him over to his wife. He said to his wife, “Kill him, take out his 
liver and hang it up over the door. I will invite my compadre 
to give thanks to God! before we come into the house.” Wild- 
Giant then went out to invite his compadre? 
The woman picked up her machad’ to split wood. Shecould not 
split it. Frigajonsi’ began to cry. The woman said to him, “It 
is a shame for you to cry like that!””—“‘I’m not crying for myself, 
I’m crying for you. You can’t split wood with that soft hand of 
yours. It’s seeing you try which makes me cry. If you loosen 
my hand, Pll split it for you. Vl show you that a man is a man.” 
She untied his hand, he took the machad’, he gave the block a blow, 
the pieces flew. The woman went to get the pieces which flew, 
she came to put them down in front of him. As soon as she stooped 
to put the wood in front of him, Frigajonsi’ hit her with the machad’ 
on the neck, he cut off her neck. Then he cooked her, he put her 
liver above the door, he put her bones on the bed, he covered 
them.‘ He said to the parrot, “You must tell me when Wild- 
Giant is coming. If you do not tell me, I will kill you.” As 
soon as the parrot told him that the giant was approaching, 
Frigajonsi’ took the parrot, he made off to the house of the king. 
Wild-Giant arrived with his compadre. Wild-Giant reached up, 
he took the liver, he bit off a mouthful, he gave a piece to his 
_compadre. The giant said, “Thank God that at last we’ve got 
that rascal!” The compadre called to his comadre. Wild-Giant 
said to him, “Oh, don’t call her! she is resting. She must be 
tired, she worked hard killing and cooking that robber. Come! 
. let us sit down, let us eat him! Thank God we’ve got him!” 
The compadre stuck his fork into the stew, he brought it up with 
a woman’s breast; * he said, ““Was he a man or a woman?”—

“No, I don’t trust you.” — “If I didn’t want to die, I'd never have come here. I’m 
tired of living.” She loosens his hand, and he splits the wood in four pieces. “If I had 
both hands free, I could split better.” She loosens the other hand. (San Nicolao.)

“Oh, he was fat, he had a breast like a woman! That is Friga- 
jonsi’, all right!” After they ate, they smoked. Compadre said 
that he was going to rouse his comadre. He took the cover off 
the bed, they saw the bones. They sat down, they wept. 
Next day in the morning his brothers said to the king, “Do you 
know what Frigajonsi’ is boasting? He says he is able to bring 
you Wild-Giant here to your house.” The king rejoined, “I 
don’t believe that he said that!”—“‘Call him and ask him.” 
The king said to Frigajonsi’, “Frigajonsi’, your brothers say that 
you say you are able to bring me Wild-Giant here in my house.” — 
“YT didn’t say it; but if my brothers said so, I said so too.” Friga- 
jonsi’ asked the king to give him a barrel with a top and a lock. 
He took this barrel, he went and took tobacco,! rubbed it in his 
eyes until his eyes reddened and watered, he put on old clothes. 
He took the barrel to the house of Wild-Giant. When he came 
near the house, he set the barrel down on the ground; he called, 
“O my friend! Iam thirsty. Can you not bring me something 
to drink?” Wild-Giant brought him water. He drank. Then 
they began to talk to each other. Wild-Giant began to tell him 
about a man called Frigajonsi’. “He stole my manioc, he stole 
my horse, my spread, my parrot, and he killed my daughters 
and wife. He is a devil.”—“Don’t speak to me of that man,” 
rejoined Frigajonsi’, “‘he did the same thing to me. See how he 
left me! Look at my sore eyes and my old clothes! He left me 
as you see me.” Wild-Giant answered, “He’s a devil.” Friga- 
jonsi’ said to him, ‘‘This world is no place for us. I'll tell you what 
we will do. Ill put myself in this barrel, you roll me a little way, 
I will come out, you go in, I will roll you too.” Wild-Giant said, 
“Let me go in, roll me first.” Wild-Giant put himself in the 
barrel. Frigajonsi’ put the cover on the barrel, he locked it, he 
sealed it. He said to him, “Wild-Giant, I told you that I was 
going to settle you!” Frigajonsi’ rolled the barrel to the king’s 
house. He went along whistling. He told the king to make a 
fire in the furnace.2 They threw the barrel into the furnace. It 
so hard, they break all the plates trying to cut it. Re’ Gentiu is dissatisfied with the queen’s 
cooking, so he goes into her room and gives the head on the bed a blow. The head falls 
down.... Re’ Gentiu is so overcome, he jumps out of the highest window and kills 
himself. (San Nicolao.)

[After the father died, instructing Manuel, the elder brother, 
to mind Fricajonsi’ because he was the younger,] Fricajonsi’ said 
to Manuel, “I am going to set our storehouse on fire. The rats 
in it keep me awake.” — ‘‘When we burn it, what are we going to 
eat?” — “We'll work for our living.” And so Fricajonsi’ burned 
down the storehouse.’ He saved a door, they took it with them, 
they set off to find a living. On their way they came to the house 
of an old woman. She hired them to work on her farm. Next 
morning Manuel went out to work, and Fricajonsi’ staid in to cook 
for the old woman. While he was feeding her, he choked her. 
1 Variant: Adrian asks for a horse and wagon and clothes (sestiment’) from the king. 
He drives by Lion’s house. Lion calls out, “Sir Priest, Sir Priest! I want to see you. I 
have much to confess.” Adrian answers, “I have no time, I’m ina hurry.” Lion insists. 
Adrian says, “The best I can do for you is to take you in this wagon with me and let you 
make your confession at my house.” Adrian drives Lion to the king’s house. The king 
takes him into custody and sells him.... ‘The king gives Adrian much credit, and mar- 
ries him to one of his daughters. He becomes a king and the owner of the lion that had 
wanted to devour him. (Cab’ Verde.) 
2 Meaning on Ash Wednesday (Quartafeira de cinza). Actually the ashes are obtained 
from burning in barrels the discarded garments of the church’s images. The garments 
are oil-soaked, and the barrels are put out on St. John’s Eve and set a-fire. Every house 
burns up its rags in similar fashion, and the children run through the village jumping 
over the burning barrels,— salta Sao Fodo (“Jump of St. John’’).— On Ash Wednesday 
the priest makes a cross of ashes on the head of every male and on the forehead of every 
female. See JAFL 34: 102. 
3 Variants: (a) The brothers of Jon Picaninh’ learn to read and write, because they see it 
is important to know how to read and write. If Jon had not been able to read, they would 
all have been killed like rats. (San Nicolao.) 
(8) “You have money, but no beasts,” says the youngest to the two other brothers. 
The ycungest gets one horse from the north, one from the south, and ties the brothers to 
them. He whips up the horses, and splits the brothers in two. He returns to his father’s 
house and gives him the money.— They live a new life, a life new. (Boa Vista.)

* Variant: On their father’s death, after staying indoors three weeks, the youngest 
brother (coude) sends his brothers to bring in the crops. Their three storehouses are filled 
with corn, beans, and round beans. “In the storehouses,” the youngest now tells the 
others, “there is an insect that will destroy the crops and us too. We must burn down the 
storehouses.” ... The eldest brother sends the protesting youngest to the well to get 
water. As he fails to return, the eldest brother goes after him, and finds him beating the 
well with a stick and bidding the water run to their house. “What are you doing?” — 
“Driving the water home, a barrel full is not enough for us.” The eldest calls the young- 
est a dunce, picks up the barrel and carries it home. Next day the eldest brother sends 
the youngest to gather wood. As he fails to return, the eldest brother goes after him, and. 
finds him beating the bundle of wood which had rolled down the side of the hill. “What 
are you doing?” — “Beating the wood up hill. If it rolled down, it can just as well roll 
up.” The eldest brother concludes he will not send the youngest out any more.

Then he propped her up by the door, and in her hand he put a 
machad’. When Manuel came back from work, he found Frica- 
jonsi’ outside crying. ‘‘What’s the matter, Fricajonsi’?” — “The 
old woman is behind the door with the machad’, and she won’t 
let mein.” Manuel pushed open the door, and the old woman fell 
to the floor ‘‘Now see what you have done, Manuel! You have 
killed the old woman. Now you'll have to go to prison.” — 
“Don’t tell any one, Fricajonsi’! Let us wait until night and bury 
her. Only don’t tell any one!” They shrouded the corpse, put 
it on their door, and with it on their shoulders went into the town 
and cried, “Who wants to buy this pig? Who wants to buy this 
pig?” “How much?” asked a man. ‘Twenty dollars.” — 
“Here’s the money, but I’m in a hurry. Put the pig down, and 
Pll return for it.” 2 
They met a man with a live pig on his way to town to sell. 
“T’m going to take that pig away from that man,” said Frica- 
jonsi’ to Manuel. Fricajonsi’ ran ahead of the man, threw his right 
shoe in the road, and hid to watch the man. The man came along 
and noticed the shoe. “If there were a pair, I’d take them with 
me,” said the man. Fricajonsi’ ran ahead again, and threw his 
left shoe in the road, and hid to watch the man. The man came 
along and noticed the shoe. “Here is the left shoe. I'll tie my 
pig up here and go back and pick up the other.” Out came 
Fricajonsi’ and took the pig.* 
{Here follows the note-substitution incident. Fricajonsi’, who 
is a dibinio, writes a note directing the wife of the king who has 
employed them to give them each fifty dollars and a bottle of 
brandy (agordente). Now follow the bedspread, the parrot, and 
the horse-stealing incidents. The cat pulls the bedspread or manta 
with bells at its corners, first from the side of the wife, then from 
that of the husband, again from husband to wife and from wife to 
husband. “Don’t pull the cover off me!” each exclaims... . 
The bells on the horse jangle, and the king catches Fricajonsi’. 
1 Variant: The youngest brother has dressed up in the clothes of one of his brothers 
the old woman they have adopted as their mother. “She has taken your clothes,” he cries, 
“and won’t let any one in.” The eldest asks her three times to get out of his way, and 
then he shoves past her, tumbling her down. 
2 Variant: A shepherd sees them carrying the corpse ina bag. “Is that a pig on your 
shoulders?” — “Yes.” — “Want to sell it?” — “Yes.” — “How much?” — “Hundred 
dollars.” The shepherd opens the bag to see if his pig is fat. “That’s the kind of pig 
you sell!” he yells after them making off with the money. “Yes, I killed a pig,” yelled ~ 
back the youngest brother, “that woman you killed.”

“The third time I told you I’d get you!” ... When Fricajonsi’ 
splits the wood for the king’s wife with the right hand she has 
untied, she exclaims, “You are right, a man is a man (home é@ 
home)!” Fricajonsi’ covers himself up in the woman’s bed! .. . 
When the king’s compadre brings up the woman’s breast, the king 
says, “He was a man, but his chest was like a woman’s. That is 
why he was such a bad man.” As Fricajonsi’ steals out of the 
house, he calls back, ‘Do you know what you have just eaten? 
You have eaten your wife!’’] 
Fricajonsi’ asked the man he was staying with, an enemy of the 
king’s, for a horse and wagon and some tools. He disguised him- 
self as a priest and drove past the king’s house. “Sir Priest, where 
are you going?” called the king. ‘‘There is a sick man down the 
street. I’m going to confess him.”’ — ‘“‘ Confess me before you go,” 
begged the king. And he confessed to the priest all he had done 
to Fricajonsi’. ‘I’ve heard about this fellow Fricajonsi’,” said the 
priest. “Now I must go on to confess the sick man.” — “Before 
you go, make me a casket,” begged the king, “for I see you carry 
carpenter’s tools. I’m all alone here. If I die, I want to have a 
casket at hand for my burial.”? The priest measured the king 
for his casket, and made it. “I tell you what we can do,” said the 
priest. ‘Let me carry you in this casket to where Fricajonsi’ is, 
and then J’ll take you out, and together we'll kill Fricajonsi’.’’ 
The king agreed. He got into the casket, and Fricajonsi’ put on 
the cover and lifted the casket into his wagon. Fricajonsi’ had 
taken with him a horn, and he had told the people, when they 
heard the horn, to assemble. He blew his horn; and when he 
reached the house, he shouted into the casket, “I am Fricajonsi’, 
and I have brought you to the man who is your enemy to kill you! 
You are in his house.” When he started to open the casket,.the 
king’s enemy said, “I don’t want to see him. All I want is to cut 
the casket through with my sword!” 
1 Variant: Putsamortar in the bed, with the head of thewoman showing. _(Cab’ Verde.) 
2 It is not uncommon in the Islands for a person to keep his casket on hand, or his 
shroud and winding-cord. A Fogo man told me his mother had kept her shroud and cord 
in a box for some years before her death. “(She said she wanted nobody to have the 
trouble to provide them when she died.” See JAFL 34 : 95. 
3 Variant: Three orphan lads setting forth in the world meet a lion. ‘Where are you 
going?” asks Lion.’ “To look for a man who will be a father to us.” — “I am that man,” 
says Lion. He writes to his wife to cook one boy for breakfast, one for dinner, one for 
supper.... That night Adrian, the youngest, exchanges the three red caps worn by him 
and his brothers for the three white caps worn by the three sons of Lion.... Lion has a 
cock that talks, and in each case it is this cock that tells Lion of Adrian’s theft. In pur- 
suing Adrian, Lion cannot pass beyond a certain boundary described as ¢erra or chon

27. THE TUG-OF-WAR! 
One day Rabbit saw a big elephant. He went up to him; he 
said, “Sir Uncle Elephant, you’ve big feet, you must be strong.” 
He grabbed hold of Elephant’s foot; he said, “Oh, what a big 
foot!” Elephant said to him, “O you impudent thing! you make 
me feel like slapping you.” Rabbit answered, “Do you know 
what I feel like doing is to put this rope around your belly.” 
(Rabbit had a coil of rope in his hands.) Elephant said, “What 
are you saying? Why do you want to put a rope around my 
belly?” — “To drag you down to the sea and throw you in.” — 
“Td like to see you drag me to the sea. Put the rope around my 
belly and try.” Rabbit put the rope around Elephant’s belly, he 
started to go towards the shore. He said to him, “My uncle, 
when you feel me pulling hard, you pull hard too, because, if you 
do not pull, I’ll drag you down to the sea.” Elephant sat down, 
he held on to the rope. Then Rabbit went down to the beach, 
where he saw Whale. Whale said to him, “What do you want 
here?” Rabbit answered, ““My Aunt Whale, I have a mind to 
pull you ashore.” Whale said to him, ‘I'd like to see you do it!” 
Rabbit lassoed the tail of Whale, and Whale started to pull away. 
“Oh, what a disgrace!” said Elephant. He threw all his weight 
on the rope. “Oh, what a disgrace, that that little rabbit is 
pulling me!” He pulled back, he dragged Whale in to the shore. 
Whale cried out, ““What a disgrace! Oh, what a disgrace, that 
that little rabbit is pulling me this way!” He pulled again, he 
dragged Elephant down to the sea. “Disgrace! Disgrace!” 
cried Elephant. Whale heard him, she came inshore. They 
saw each other; each said to the other, “I thought it was that 
little rabbit that was there pulling against me.” Then Elephant 
said to Whale, “You belong to the sea, I belong to the land, I’m 
going after him.” Rabbit, who was back of the hill, began to 
laugh at them. He heard them, he ran, he went where there lay 
margos’, (“the bitter land”); there he calls out toAdrian, “When are you coming back this’ 
way?” — “I don’t know, when God wishes.” ... When Lion begs the priest to confess 
him, the priest says he is in too great haste to stop; the best he can do is to take him home 
with him, where he can make his confession. Taking Lion to the king’s house (the king 
was Adrian’s employer), he sells Lion to the king, just as he had sold Lion’s possessions. 
The king marries Adrian to one of his daughters, and Adrian becomes king and the owner 
of the lion who wanted to devour him. (Cab’ Verde.)

said to the skull, ‘Have you seen a rabbit around here?” The 
skull answered, “‘Don’t mention his name! When he came this 
way, he pointed his finger at me, he got me as you see me.”’ 
Elephant said to him, ‘‘Oh, if you see him again, don’t tell him 
which way I went!” He started running! Rabbit came out of 
the skull; he hollered, “Uncle Elephant, I’m coming after you!’’ 
Elephant hollered; he said, ‘You dried-up tail!” He kept on 
running. He ran so far away, that nowadays we never see him.

There was once a little rabbit (coe/hinh’). He was impudent. 
One day he was going along smoking a cigar. He met Wolf. 
Wolf said to him, ‘‘You’ve been well brought up! You smoke 
before a big man like me!””* Little-Rabbit answered, “I paid for 
this tobacco with my money, and not with yours. Nor have I 
asked you for a match.” — “Is that the way to answer me? 
What if I pull your ear?” — “No, we can’t fight for this. I’m 
not mad yet. If you want to fight, we'll fight Wednesday. 
Wednesday I’ll bring a chain. Ill give you one end here behind 
this hill, the other end I'll take to the seashore. Then we'll pull 
against each other. If I drag you to the water, you are mine; 
if you drag me inland, you may kill me.” Little-Rabbit went 
down to the seashore, he saw Whale. He had his cigar in- his 
mouth. As he did not respect Wolf, he did not respect Whale. 
Whale said, “What kind of education have you had to smoke 
before me?” — “That makes the second who has insulted me 
to-day. This tobacco I bought with my own money. Wednes- 
day we are going to fight. I'll bring a chain. You stay here in 
the sea with one end, with the other end I’ll go behind the hill. 
If you pull me down to the sea, I am yours; if I pull you up, you 
are mine.” * Wednesday he went to the shore, he gave one end 
of the chain to Whale, then he went behind the hill, he gave the

she begins to beat the water. Elephant gets mad too, and. begins to run through the 
woods. Rabbit goes into the head of the carcass of a donkey. Elephant says to the 
carcass, “Have you seen Rabbit around here?” The carcass answers, “Rabbit passed 
here about an hour ago, running as fast as he could.” Elephant goes on after him. (San 
Anton: ant Jon Santana of San Nicolao. 
3 In the Islands, lads never smoke before older men. They would be cuffed for it. A 
son, whatever his age, does not smoke in the presence of his father. A man told me his 
father would even leave tobacco around for’ him, but before his father he would never 
smoke it. See JAFL 34: 93.

other end to Wolf He said to each of them, “When you feel me 
pull, it is for you to know that I’m ready.” Then he went to the 
middle of the chain, he made the signal, he stood there on one 
side laughing. They pulled, pulled, pulled, they pulled for seven 
days. Whale pulled Wolf down to the seashore. When Whale 
saw Wolf, she said to him, “Wolf, I thought I was pulling against 
Little-Rabbit.” Wolf said to Whale, “Me too, I thought I was 
pulling against Little-Rabbit.” Whale said to him, “You know 
that I belong in the sea. I'll throw you all the fish you want to 
eat, if you'll catch Little-Rabbit for me.” Wolf answered, “I'll 
catch him.” He saw Little-Rabbit, he ran after him. Little- 
Rabbit ran, he went into the corpse of a donkey. He went into 
its head. When Wolf came to pass by, he was such a fool, he 
did not see that the donkey was dead, he asked him if he had not 
seen Little-Rabbit. Little-Rabbit inside the head of the donkey 
asked him, “Why are you looking for him?” — “Because he got 
me pulling against Whale. I want to catch him and kill him.” 
Donkey said, “I was the fattest donkey around here when Little- 
Rabbit passed by; he pointed his little? finger at me, he dried 
me up as you see me.” Wolf answered, “Don’t tell him I’m 
around here, because he might point his little finger at me.” — 
“You better go your way quickly, because, if he is around here, 
perhaps he will point his little finger at you and dry you up like 
me.” When Wolf ran off about twenty feet, Donkey called out, 
“Little-Rabbit, here is Wolf looking for you!” Wolf went back- 
wards with his eyes on Donkey, begging Little-Rabbit not to point 
his little finger at him. He went backwards, he came to a cliff, 
over he fell. Yesterday I passed by there, I saw him lying head up. 
28. THE MASTER THIEF? 
There was a man had an only daughter. She was pretty, the 
boys used to go to her house to see her. Her father did not like it, 
that big body of yours, I am stronger than you.” — “Were I to butt you with my fore- 
head, I’d throw you to Infern’,” rejoins Whale. (San Vicente.) 
1 Variant: Nephew (Xibinh’) proposes to Wolf that he, Wolf, and Nephew’s little dog, 
pull against each other. The little dog does not pull at all, but hides behind a rock. 
Wolf is really pulling against Whale. (Boa Vista.) [The tale was told in a fragmentary 
and confused way.]

meant; but in the Islands, it was insisted, the little finger is not used as a pointer.

he shut her up in a room by herself. She was fifteen years old. 
One day her father went away, he told her mother not to let her 
out. Her mother had no water, she sent the girl to get water at 
the well. Within five minutes she was pregnant. Her father 
learned of it, he turned her out of doors, he disinherited her. 
She was ashamed; she went away to live, far from her father and 
mother. When the time came, the child was born. She lived in 
penury, but she bore it with patience. Her son, José, grew up, 
she sent him to school. After three days in school, he came home; 
he told his mother that he knew all that was taught in that school. 
“The school I want to go to is a school where I can learn to steal.”’ 
His mother grieved, because she was set on her son being a help to 
her some day.? ‘ 
José went to a school of thieves. Within thirty days he knew 
more than the master. One day the master sent one of the best 
boys out to steal, for they had nothing to eat. The boy returned 
without anything. José said, ‘You better send me.” — “Not 
you! you don’t know enough,” said the master. They saw a man 
coming on the road with an ox on a rope. “I’m going to take 
that ox away from that man,” said José. “If you are able to take 
that ox away from that man,” said the master, “you'll prove to 
me you know all you need know.” José went out, he took with 
him a silver shoe. He went ahead of the man who was coming 
with the ox, he threw the shoe into the road, he hid. The man 
saw the shoe. “Oh, what a pretty shoe!” he said. “Ifit were a 
pair, I’d take them to my daughter (his daughter was getting 
married, he was taking the ox for the feast); but I can’t do any- 
thing with one shoe.”’ José ran on ahead again, he dropped the 
single shoe in the road. “Now there’s a pair!” said the man. 
“T’ll tie the ox here, I'll go back to find the other shoe. I'll have 
a pair to take to my daughter.” José cut the rope of the ox, he 
took the ox to his master. His master gave him a certificate. 
1 This is the treatment not unusually accorded girls who have had a relationship out- 
side of marriage or who have married without their father’s approval. Some other relative 
will take the girl in, or she may go to live with her man’s people. I heard of one instance 
in Fogo where the girl had lived three years with her husband’s parents before the mar- 
riage ceremony was performed. There is no prostitution in the Islands. 
2 Variants: (a) Mother goes to church to pray to her son Vicente’s patron saint to keep 
the boy from stealing. The boy hides behind San Vicente; and the woman hears the saint 
say, “If Vicente doesn’t steal, what will his life amount to?” (Fogo.) 
(6) There is 2 woman who wants a child. She asks San Anton to give her a son. 
When the child is born, she gives him to the saint as a godchild. As Vicente grows up, he 
steals everything in sight. When the mother goes to the church to ask San Anton to help, 
Vicente, hiding behind the saint, says, “Let the boy do as he likes.” (San Vicente.) 
The boy is also called “Vicente,” or rather “ Bicentinh’,” in Cab’ Verde.

When the owner of the ox came back, he found theoxgone. He 
thought the ox had chewed up the rope. “It has gone to the 
corral. I'll go get my big sheep, I will take it home.” José 
killed the ox, he took the hide off the ox, he dressed up with the 
horns on his head like an ox.!. He went to wait for the man on 
the road where the man was coming with the sheep. He acted 
like an ox, he lowed. The man said, “Oh, there’s my ox! You 
think you’ve escaped; but I’m going to tie my sheep, I’m going 
to catch you.” The man started to pass through a wood of 
pulgeira, When he left, José circled around, he untied the sheep. 
At this time the man was looking for a pig to serve up at the 
marriage. He had news that the boy was a bigger thief than his 
master. Then José put on the sheep-skin to fool the man. This 
time the man took no notice of him; he went on his way with his 
pig. José said, “Oh, you think you’re smart! I’m going to get 
that pig yet.” The man killed the pig, he salted it, he put it 
into a house where he alone went. That night they heard a cat 
mewing at the door. The woman said, ‘‘We have many rats here. 
God has sent us a cat to kill them.” The man said to her, “Wife, 
you better be careful, that may be that rascal of a José.” — “You 
are a fool, how can any one turn into a cat?” said the woman. 
“Tt’s impossible.” The woman made a bed for the cat. Then 
they went to bed, they slept. José stole into the meat-house, he 
took the barrel of meat, he went with it. Early in the morning 
the man. saw the door of the house open, the pork gone. The 
man said, “The load is heavy, I'll catch him yet on the road on 
my way to the corral.”” The man started out to look after his 
cattle, he came to a hill, he saw José down at the foot. He yelled 
to him, “Put it down! Put it down!” José dropped the barrel 
of meat, he ran off. He went to the herder’s house. He said to 
the woman, “Your husband has sent me to you to get a dress of 
yours to give a woman he has found naked.” The woman gave 
him the dress. He dressed himself as a woman, he ran back to 
the man, he went out on the height; he said to the man, “Husband, 
did you get it?” — “Yes, I got it.” — “‘Put the barrel down, go 
tend to your cattle. I'll carry the barrel home myself.” The 
man put down the barrel, he went to tend his cattle; José took 
the barrel, he carried it to his master. 
José met Wolf on the road with twelve hundred head of cattle 
near a house where a dance was on. José said to Wolf, “They

want you to go play for them.’ Wolf was greedy, he left his 
cattle, he went. He said to them, “I won’t play for you until 
you give me to eat and drink until I am full, then P'll play you a 
fine piece.” José watched him sit down to eat, he ran, he took 
Wolf’s cows. He drove them home to his mother, who for so 
many years had been living in misery. 
29.1 THE MASTER THIEF: THE KING’S TREASURY, 
[When the owner of the ox went home with only one shoe, he 
told his wife what had happened. He was bringing her the shoes. 
“Tt was all on your account.” — “Fool!” she rejoined, “go and 
sell the sheep!”} 
When the boy [Spericanhota *] took the sheep, he carried it to 
his master. His master said to him, “You are a smart boy. 
You’d be a still smarter boy could you take the eggs away from 
under a sparrow.” Spericanhota said, “You couldn’t do that 
yourself.” —- ‘‘Do you want to see me do it? Go in and get a pair 
of trousers lying there, bring them to me.” Before the boy 
brought out the trousers, he cut holes in the pockets. The master 
said to him, “I’m going to put the sparrow’s eggs in my pockets. 
I’m going to climb this tree without it shaking. The sparrow 
won’t know I’m onit. I'll get all her eggs, she will not fly away.’’ 
He climbed up the tree, he got all four eggs, he put them in his 
pockets. The eggs slipped out, they fell down; Spericanhota 
caught them, he put them in his pocket. The master said to him, 
“You see that is the way to work. Can you do that?” — 
“Master, you are smart; but the fellow who gets eggs out of a 
man’s pockets without his knowing it is smarter yet. Here are 
the eggs you stole from the sparrow.” The master exclaimed, 
“You are smarter than me! I'll have nothing more to do with 
you.” . 
The boy returned to the house of his father. [His father had 
driven him from home when he had said he wanted to learn to 
rob.] His father asked him, “Have you learned what you set out 
to learn?” — “Yes, sir!” His father said, “To prove it to me,

bring me some money.” Each night for three nights he went to 
steal, he brought home a sack of money from the king’s house. 
His father was well satisfied. The king asked the said’ what he 
should do to catch the robber. The said’ said, “There is only one 
way for you to catch him, it is with a barrel of tar with money on 
top.” On the fourth night the father said he wanted to go along 
with him to help him steal. His son begged him, “Don’t go! 
Idon’t want you to go. They will catch you, I shall lose my life 
on your account. ” But his father insisted on going. As they 
were going along, they saw the barrel. The boy said, “That is a 
rat-trap. You stay here quiet. I'll do all the work.” He went 
on, he left his father behind. His father saw the money in the 
barrel. He jumped into the barrel to get it, he stuck in the tar 
up to his neck.1_ When he came back, he saw his father stuck. 
He said to him, “Father, I knew you were greedy. Now you are 
going to stay there.” He took a large knife he had with him, he 
cut off his father’s head. He took it home with him.2 He said 
to his mother, “I’m going to bury my father’s head here in the 
yard. Now, whatever happens, don’t say anything!” 
Next day the king’s people found the headless body in the 
barrel, the clothes all black from tar, they could not recognize it. 
The king sent word to the said’ that he had caught the robber, but 
he did not know who he was or where he lived. The said’ said to 
him, “Put a rope around his feet, have him dragged through the 
streets. If people cry, they who cry will be his people.” They 
began to drag the corpse; the man’s wife saw it, she began to 
weep. He [Spericanhota] heard his mother cry, he ran in from 
the yard, he cut his finger on the block, and cried out loud,

something too! This is no place to linger.” Three times he tells Barrel to move on, but 
Barrel gives no answer. Angry, the man strikes the barrel with his right hand, and his 
hand sticks. “Let go, or I’ll give it to you with my other hand!” He strikes with the 
left hand, and that hand sticks. “Stop fooling! this is no place to fool!” and he kicks

“Mother, mother, I have cut my finger! I have cut my finger!”” 
The man dragging the corpse heard the crying, he camein. They 
said, “This is the place.” The boy said, ““My mother’s crying 
because I cut my finger.” The men returned to the king, they 
reported that they found nobody crying but one woman, who was 
crying because her son cut his finger. The king sent again to 
the sais’. The said’ said, “There is still another way. Place 
the body in the church, set a guard of soldiers. The man’s people 
will certainly try to take it away to bury it.” The boy got a 
bottle of gin, he put tobacco in it, he took it with him to the 
church. He said to the sentinels, “Friends, you are cold, would 
you like to take a drink?” — “We'd like a drink, if nobody sees 
us. We’re on watch here to see the people who stole the money 
in the king’s house.” The boy brought out the bottle which he 
had under his coat. Each soldier took a drink. They got heavy, 
they leaned against the wall, they went to sleep. The boy said.

dropped his gun, he fell on his back asleep. The boy tied one 
end of a little rope he had with him to the feet of the corpse, the 
other end around his own neck, he dragged the corpse home. He 
said to his mother, “Here he is. Hurry up! we will bury him in

“Now, mother, don’t cry! We have plenty of money to last us 
for the rest of our lives.”

There was a woman who wanted a child. She asked San 
Anton to give her a son. When the boy was born, she gave him 
to San Anton as a godchild. Vicente grew up, he stole everything 
in sight. The woman went to church to ask help from San Anton. 
Vicente hid behind San Anton; he said, “Let the boy do as he 
likes.” The father of Vicente was stealing in a store. The store- 
keeper saw him, but did not know who he was. He began to 
watch; he did not know how to catch him. Vicente was stealing

where there was crying. One of the sons puts a like mark on all the other house-doors,

in the same store. The storekeeper made a man of tar, he put it 
in the store. Vicente went to the store ahead of his father. He 
saw the man of tar; he came home; he said to his father, “Be 
careful! there is a man of tar there.” When the father went 
there, he saw the man of tar looking at him. He said, “Why are 
you looking at me?” No answer. He said, ‘You don’t speak, 
haven’t you a mouth?” No answer. He punched him. His 
hand stuck. He said, “If you don’t let this hand go, I’ll give it to 
you with the other hand.” No answer. He gave it to him with 
the other hand. Then he kicked him with one foot. The foot 
stuck. He kicked him with the other foot. The foot stuck. 
Next day the storekeeper caught the man. He sent the news to 
all the houses in the city. He said, “The house where they are 
crying is the house to which he belongs.”” When they were passing 
with the body, Vicente said to his mother, “Since you must cry, 
put your hand on the block.” He cut off one of her fingers. The 
judge said, “That is the house.” Vicente said, “You fools! don’t 
you see that my mother has her finger cut off?” They marked the 
house with chalk. Early in the morning Vicente got up and put 
the same mark on all the houses of the city. They could not find: 
out the house. 
Vicente went to a school of thieves. He asked the master to 
give him a chance in the school. One day a man came along the 
soad with a pig. The master said, “Who is clever enough to get 
that pig from that man?” Vicente answered, “That’s me, 
Master.” He took the pig from the man. The next day the same 
man came along with a sheep. The master said, “Who is clever 
enough to get the sheep?” Vicente answered, “That’s me, 
Master.” He dressed up in the pig-skin. He acted like a pig. 
The man left the sheep to get the pig. Vicente ran and took the 
sheep. The next day the same man came along with a cow. The 
master said, “Who is clever enough to get the cow?” Vicente 
answered, ““That’s me, Master.” He put on the sheep’s skin and 
acted like a sheep. The man said, ‘“‘There’s my sheep.” He left 
the cow to go and get the sheep. Vicente went and stole the cow. 
The next day a bird flew by with eggs in its bill (?). The 
master said, “Who is clever enough to get those eggs?” Vicente 
answered, “That’s me, Master.” An old scholar said, “No, you 
go every day. This time I go.” The master sent this boy. He 
stole the eggs. Vicente went behind him and stole the eggs from

his pocket. He put his hand in his pocket and found nothing. 
Vicente showed them the eggs. The master said, “Get out from 
here as soon as you can! You are a greater thief than I.” 
Vicente went home to his mother. He went to the house of 
the king, he stole the queen’s dress. The king announced that 
whosoever was found with the queen’s dress would be beheaded. 
The king kept a white horse he valued in a stable guarded. 
by soldiers. Vicente made the soldiers drunk with brandy 
(agordente) and went away with the horse. The next day he 
made a bag of the queen’s dress, took it to a potato-field, where 
he filled it with potatoes, and then rode with it on the king’s 
horse past the king’s house. The king had him arrested and 
imprisoned. But Vicente broke jail and ran to the king’s house. 
There he put on the king’s uniform; and then he called to the 
queen, whom the king had just left lying down, to hand him his 
crown. -Then he ran off with the crown. When the king re- 
turned home, he was dressed in civilian clothes. ‘“‘Wasn’t that 
you standing at the door a few minutes ago, and asking me to 
hand you your crown?” asked the queen. ‘It wasn’t me, I was 
at a funeral. Hoéra cu diab’!* it was that Vicente.” The sol- 
diers the king sent after him could not find him; but the next 
day, early in the morning, Vicente himself came riding past the 
king’s house wearing the crown, and on it a head-rest, and on 
that a bag of squash. The king sent soldiers to arrest him, and 
he told him he was going to punish him with death. “The only 
way you can save yourself is by succeeding in stealing a ring from 
the queen’s finger.”” One day the king was out walking. Vicente 
left his jail, came to the king’s house, put on the king’s clothes, 
and entered the queen’s room. As he was playing with her hand, 
he said, “‘Let me keep your ring for a few days to amuse myself.”’ 
Then he took off the king’s clothes and returned to the jail. 
When the king came home, the queen took his hand to look at 
the ring. She did not see it, and she charged him with giving it 
to another woman. “I got no ring from you,” said the king. 
“Probably it was Vicente who stole it from you.” But Vicente 
would not admit he had the ring. The king announced that he 
who had trimmed eyelashes was the thief. So Vicente stole from 
jail and cut everybody’s eyelashes.? ‘‘Probably this is Vicente’s

work,” said the king. “I can’t keep him in this country.” So 
he sent him out to the mountains to be burned in tar. His ashes 
he put at the door of the barn. The king announced that he had . 
burned up Vicente, and all the people were satisfied. But when 
his mother heard of it, she went to her compadre, San Anton. 
“OQ Compadre! didn’t I ask you to spare my son that fate?” San 
Anton did not answer. “‘What’s the matter, San Anton? Haven’t 
you a mouth to speak with?” No answer. Then she threw a 
stone at the image, and it tumbled off the altar. She said, “If 
Thad known the Devil (diad’) was made of clay, I had never given 
him my son as godchild.” 
3i.! THE MASTER THIEF: THE KING’S TREASURY: TAR MAN: THE RIDDLE TEST. 
There was a man had two sons. He sent them to school. 
They finished school and came home. One night they were 
sitting out of doors, at bed-time their father called them in. 
They said, “No, we are not coming in, because we have a journey 
to make to-night.” After their father went to bed, they went to 
the house of a rich man. They went into the safe and got two 
sacks of money. They said to their father, “This is what we 
got for you.” Every night for thirty nights they went stealing. 
Their father wanted to go with them, but they would not let him 
go. The guards of the house were sleepy. They put a barrel 
of tar where they thought the thieves would come. They went 
to sleep. On the thirty-first night the father insisted on going. 
He said to his sons, “You stay at home.” He went, he saw the 
barrel of tar. He said, “Sir Barrel, make haste! get what you 
want and go! Let me get something too! This place is no place 
to stop.” The barrel did not answer. ‘Make haste, Sir Barrel! 
go, and let me pass!” The barrel did not answer. “Sir Barrel, 
move aside!” The barrel did not answer. He got angry, he 
struck the barrel with his right hand, his right hand was caught. 
“Let go, Sir Barrel! or I will give it to you with my other hand.” 
He hit with his left hand, and his left hand was caught. “Sir 
Barrel, stop playing! Unless you stop playing, I shall kick you. 
This is no place to play.” He kicked the barrel with his right 
foot. His right foot stuck. He kicked with his left foot, his 
left foot stuck. 
His sons found he did not come home. They went after him.

They cut off his head and took it with them. They left the body 
there. They came and found the body. They dragged the body 
through the streets to see to whom it belonged. They watched 
to see who would cry. The boys knew they would do this, so 
they sat working with their tools near the door, to keep their 
mother away. They told their mother not to cry, for they would. 
all three be taken and have their heads cut off. When they 
passed with the body, they saw their mother was about to cry. 
One son took his isho and cut two fingers. As they passed with 
the body, the woman cried. They put a sign on the door that 
here there was crying. The son said, ‘“‘Would a mother not be 
heartless not to cry when her son had cut off his fingers?” They 
answered, “We have nothing to do with that, we have only to 
report where there is crying.” One of the boys went and put the 
same sign on all the doors of the houses in the city. They went 
to the said’. The said’ said that there were two boys in town who 
went to school and learned how to steal. 
The king rode by the boys’ house. The king said, “I hear 
you answer any questions put to you. I want you to come to- 
morrow to my house. If you answer my question, I will give you 
a palace. If you do not answer, J will kill you.” The next day 
they went to the king’s house. The king asked one boy, “How 
many al/gue’r’ of earth are there in the world?” The boy 
answered, “If you separate all the stones and trees, I will tell you 
how many alque’r’ there are.” - The king asked the other boy, 
“How many stars are there in the sky?” He said, “Last night 
I was counting the stars. I counted 9999. If you don’t believe 
me, go up there and count them yourself.” The king made them 
his councillors. 
32. THE RIDDLE TEST} 
There was a priest, he was at the king’s house. In the midst 
of others, he was different from others. Because of his shaved 
crown, the king imagined that this man was a diviner. The 
king deemed that he was greater than all the others. The king 
wanted him to divine three riddles. The priest then said to him 
that he was not a diviner, that he had only studied for a priest. 
The king said to him that he did not want to know about that;

that he wanted him to divine three riddles. The priest went 
home very downcast. The servant set the table; he saw the priest 
was very downcast, for he did not want to eat. The priest said 
to him that the king said he had to go the following day and 
divine these three riddles: namely, “How much does the earth 
weigh?” and “I, how much am I worth?” and “I, what am I think- 
ing?” The servant then told the priest to eat without anxiety, 
that he would go on the following day and speak for him. And so 
it was. On the following day the servant told the priest to shave 
his crown and to shave his beard as well as he (was shaved), and to 
give him his collar and his gown and his four corners [cap]. The 
boy shared with [?] the priest and went direct to the house of the 
king. He arrived, and greeted the king. The king asked him 
to sit down. The king asked him if he had divined the three 
riddles: namely, what the earth weighed; and what he was 
worth; and “what am I thinking?”’ The servant then answered, 
“Would his Majesty do me the favor to take out all the stones 
from the earth, and give me the earth to weigh?” The king said 
to him that it would be a great labor. “Tell how much I am 
worth.”-—“O sir! how much can you be worth? Our Lord Jesus 
Christ was sold for thirty [pieces of] money, and by your grace I 
know it cannot cost as much.”-—“‘ And now what am I thinking?” 
“The thought you have in mind is that you are speaking with the 
priest, and, as it is, you are speaking with the servant.” End of

day Uncle Wolf came, he met the tar figure. He asked, ‘“‘What 
are you doing here? It’s you stealing on our land.” The tar 
figure did not answer him. Wolf said, “You needn’t speak. I’m 
going to knock you down, I’m going to keep you here until 
Nephew comes.”’ He gave a punch with his right hand, his right 
hand stuck. He said, “If you want to fight with me, let my 
hand go!” The figure did not stir. “I have another hand,’” 
said Wolf, and he gave him one with his left hand. His left 
hand stuck. He kicked him with his right foot, his foot stuck. 
“Oh, you're fighting well! I’ve still a foot.” He kicked him 
with his left foot, his left foot stuck. “You’ve got my foot, but 
I’m going to butt you with my belly.” He gave it to him with 
his belly, his belly stuck. “Oh, you’re doing well! but I’m going 
to bite you.” He bit, his teeth stuck. At eight o’clock Nephew 
came by. Wolf said to him, “I was watching for this fellow who 
was stealing on our land, Nephew; I caught him, he caught me 
too.” — “I’m glad you’ve got the man, my Uncle Wolf. Now 
I’m going to set fire to him to burn him up.”—‘‘Don’t set fire to 
him!” begged Wolf; “if you burn him, you'll kill your Uncle 
Wolf too.”—‘T can’t help it, my Uncle; I can’t get you two 
apart, I’ve got to burn you both.” Nephew set fire to the tar

bought a suit of clothes. In that city there lived a man who was 
the biggest thief in the world. The three boys went to his house. 
They told him that they wanted to learn to steal for their living. 
He said to them, “I am a thief, but I take nothing from any one 
by stealing.” He said to José, “‘Go into the city and get me some 
new potatoes without buying them or stealing them. If you do it, 
I shall know it in the morning from the papers.” A man was 
working on a farm of another man. The owner of the farm 
ordered him to sell old potatoes, not new potatoes. José came 
to this farm. He asked the man if he would not sell him potatoes. 
“Yes, that’s what I am here for.” José said to him, “I want 
fifty pounds of new potatoes.”——“T’ll sell you fifty pounds of 
new potatoes; but don’t tell any one, because I have no orders 
to sell new potatoes.” The man gathered together the potatoes. 
José said to him, “What do they weigh?” —“TI don’t sell potatoes 
by the pound, I sell them at a guess (a little more or less).”— 
“T was sent to buy potatoes, but new potatoes, and exactly fifty 
pounds.” The man went to the house of his neighbor to get 
scales. After he left, the boy filled his sack with potatoes and 
went his way. The man had to keep quiet about it. He did not 
tell anything, because he had no order to sell new potatoes. So 
there appeared nothing about it in the papers. 
Next day the master sent Stebo to another city to get him some 
chickens. He met an old man who lived by raising chickens. 
Stebo bought forty chickens from him. He gave him fifty dollars 
to change. The old man was poor, he could not make change. 
Stebo said to him, “Tl go to the priest’s house, I will make 
change, I will leave yours there.” In that city any one doing 
wrong was taken to the priest to be whipped. Stebo told the 
priest that the old man came in every day to sell chickens. He 
got drunk, he used bad language. “I’ve been talking with him. 
I told him to come here after mass to get some money. When he 
comes, you whip him.” When the old man arrived, mass was 
over, all the people had gone home. He said to the priest, “It’s 
me.” The priest said to him, “Yes, I know it’s you.” He took 
a whip, he gave him forty lashes. At the forty-first lash the old 
man cried out, and said, “It’s forty I want! It’s forty I want!” 
The priest said to him, “I will give you more than forty,” and 
he whipped him until he was tired. The old man went home 
weeping. 
Next day the master sent Theoph’ to another city to bring him

the best wine there was there. He went to the best store. He 
told the storekeeper he wanted to buy a bottle of good wine. 
They found two barrels of the oldest and best wine. The store- 
keeper filled a cup of wine from one of the barrels. He gave it 
to him for him to try. With his hand the storekeeper plugged up 
the hole of the barrel to keep the wine from running out. The 
boy said to him, “Let me try the other barrel.” He opened the 
other barrel for him to try. The storekeeper plugged up the 
other barrel with the other hand. The boy filled his bottle, he 
put it on his back. . He said to the storekeeper, “Which do you 
want,— to lose this bottle, or to lose the barrel?” He went his 
way. He left the storekeeper with his hand plugging the barrel, 
standing there until some one came to help him plug the barrels. 
The storekeeper kept quiet, he said nothing, so the owner of the 
store would not know. 
The master said to the three boys that they could go to a far 
country as far as from here to Cuba. Here they met a rich man 
who was a gambler. They waited until he went to sleep. Then 
they went in, they drew out the table, they put it in the middle of 
the floor, they drew up five chairs. They divided the playing- 
cards into five parts. All the things in the house they stacked 
in the middle of the floor. Whoever held the best hand was to 
win all these things. They dealt the cards; the worst hand they 
gave to the master of the house. They woke the manup. When 
he woke up, he called for the policeman. He told him that they 
came to rob his house. They said that they were not stealing. 
“See the cards on the table.” They went to court. In court it 
was known that the man was a gambler, he used to gamble in 
his house. The judge asked him, “Were you gambling?” He 
said, ‘‘No.” The master drew out the cards, he showed them to 
the judge. He said to him, “He bet all the things that he had in 
the house, we won. Then he called in the police and said we were 
stealing his goods.” The judge kicked him four times, he sent 
him home in disgrace. Again they had gotten what they wanted 
without buying it or stealing it.

35. DISH, DONKEY, AND wuiP 
There was a wolf who was married. He told his wife, “Each 
for himself, God for all.” He went into the mountains, he found 
a little dish. Wolf asked, “What is your name?” Little-Dish 
answered, “My name is Teg.” — “Teq, let me see you!” Little- 
Dish filled up with all sorts of things to eat. Wolf ate, ate, ate, 
until he was full. Then he took Little-Dish home to his wife. 
He said to his wife, “Ask its name.” —‘‘ What is your name?”— 
“My name is Teq.”—‘Teq, let me see you!” Little-Dish filled 
itself. Wolf took Little-Dish to the king’s house. “Ask its 
name,” he said to the king. The king asked, “What is your 
name?”—‘‘My name is Teq.”—“Teq, let me see you!” Little- 
Dish filled up. The king told the servant to take away the little 
dish and put another in its place. When Wolf came to ask Little- 
Dish its name, the little dish did not answer him. Wolf got 
mad, he broke the little dish, he went home. 
He said to his wife, “Each for himself, God for all.” He went 
out to the mountains. There he met a donkey. He asked, 
“What is your name?”’—‘‘ My name is Shit-Gold.”—“Shit-Gold!” 
said Wolf, and the donkey began to drop gold. Wolf took the 
gold, he drove the donkey home. “Ask Donkey his name,” 
he said to his wife. “Donkey, what is your name?” —“ My name 
is Shit-Gold.”—“Shit-Gold!” said she. Donkey dropped gold. 
Wolf drove Donkey to the king’s house. “Ask him his name,” 
he said. “Donkey, what is your name?”-—‘Shit-Gold.” The 
king said, “Shit-Gold!” Then Donkey dropped gold. The 
king told his servant to take away that donkey and put another 
in its place. When Wolf spoke to the donkey, it did not answer 
him. He got mad, he thrust the donkey over the cliffs. 
“Each for himself, God for all,” he said to his wife. He went 
out into the mountains. There he found twenty-four dozen 
sticks of marmulan’. “What is your name?”—‘‘My name is 
Chap-Chap,” ? said Sticks-of-Marmulan’. Wolf took them home. 
He said to his wife, ““Ask their name.”-—‘‘ What is your name?” —

There was a wolf who was married, he had four children. One 
day he went fishing; he caught a fish * that asked him to let it go. 
“No, I can’t let you go. My wife and children are hungry.’” 
The fish said to him, “Let me go, and I will dive down and bring 
you up a little dish [¢ergorinha]. Every time you want to feed 
your children, say, ‘Tergorinha teq,’ and there will be enough.’ ” 
On his way home he met his nephew. Nephew stole from him 
‘the little dish. 
Next day Wolf went fishing again, and he caught the same fish. 
“Let me go!” said the fish. “No, I can’t let you go. My wife 
and children are hungry.”—‘‘Let me go, and I will dive down and 
bring you up a white plate [prar’ branc’|. You have only to say, 
‘Prat’ prututu’ * for it to be filled up with gold and silver.” On 
his way home he met Nephew. ‘‘What have you got?” asked 
Nephew. ‘I won’t tell you, you will steal it,” said Wolf. Nephew 
went and told the king. The king sent for Wolf, and took the 
plate away from him. 
Wolf went fishing again in the same place, and caught the fish. 
“Let me go!” said the fish. ‘“‘No, I can’t let you go. My wife 
and children are hungry.” —‘‘Let me go, and I will dive down and 
bring you up a little club. You have only to say, ‘Little-Club, 
strike! [Manducinha, lap!) and the club will strike anybody on 
the head and knock him down.” 
When Wolf went home, his wife asked him what he got this 
time. He called, “Little-Club, strike!” and the club knocked 
down his wife and knocked down all the children. “Now I have

king.” He went to the king, and said, “You took the plate from 
me. This time I have something even better than the plate.”— 
“What is it?” asked the king. “This little club. Say to it, 
‘Little-Club, strike!’” The king said, “Little-Club, strike!” and, 
strike! strike! strike! the club knocked down the king, knocked 
down the queen, and knocked down all the people in the house.

There was a wolf who was a fisherman. One day he went 
fishing in company. He was a man who generally caught more 
than any one else, but this time the other fellow caught more. 
Wolf came home angry. He told his wife he was going to take 
three weeks to gather crabs for bait. In those three weeks he 
filled three sacks with crabs. He went to a rock with his bait; 
he fished, but he caught nothing. When he was about to leave, 
he put on a little crab, threw in his line, and caught a siren 
(sereina). The siren said, “Let me go! I'll give you a bangainha 
that will give you whatever you want.” Wolf answered, “I'll 
lower you down. If you bring it to me, Ill let you go.” The 
siren brought up the dangainha. Wolf said, “I don’t trust you 
yet. Vm going to try it before I let you go.” He said to the 
bangainha, “By the virtue God gives you, fill up with corn-husks 
and dish-water, that I may eat till I’m full.” The Jangainha 
filled up. Wolf let the siren go, and he went home. He said to 
his wife, “Lady wife, I bring something that will give us whatever 
we need. If you don’t believe me, ask it for corn-husks and dish- 
water, and you'll see.” His wife said, “No, I’ll ask for meat 
and potatoes. That’s better.” — “You are too bold,” said Wolf. 
“Yesterday you were satisfied with corn-husks and dish-water. 
To-day you want meat and potatoes. Women want too many 
things.” Later Wolf said, “‘Wife, I’m going to take this to show 
the king. He is rich, but he hasn’t anything like this.” She 
said, “You better leave it at home. The king is smarter than you. 
He will take it from you.”—‘‘No, the king is a good man. He

won’t do that.” As Wolf passed under the window of the king, 
he saw the king sitting there. He asked, “Can’t you laugh with 
me?” The king answered, “Who would laugh with you with that 
big stomach?” Wolf said, “Laugh with me, because I have 
something here you never saw before.” The king tried the 
bangainha, and found it good. He sent for a carpenter to make 
one like it. He kept Wolf’s dangainha, and Wolf took the other 
back to his wife. She tried it, and it gave her nothing. She said, 
“T told you the king would change it on you.” Wolf said there 
was nothing for him to do but to go fishing again. He found the 
siren in the same place he had left her three days before. He 
said to her, “‘Siren, it is you I am after. You gave me a thing 
that gave me to eat just once.” The siren answered, “I gave 
you a good thing. Had you listened to your wife, you would 
never have taken it to the king’s house, and he would not have 
replaced it. Now I’ll give you something better.” Wolf was 
hungry, and he thought the siren would give him a present like 
the other. She gave hima little club (manducinha). ‘When you 
want it to strike, say, ‘Little-Club, strike! [Manducinha, lap!y 
When you want it to stop, say, ‘Little-Club, stop! [Manducinha, 
para!|’” Wolf was hungry, and said, “Little-Club, strike! 
Give me corn-husks and dish-water.”” Little-Club began to beat 
him until he could not stand it any longer. He said, “Little- 
Club, stop! All I have suffered, my wife and children must suffer 
too.” He found his wife in, and his children out playing. “Call 
them in!” he said to his wife. ‘“Here’s a little club. If what I 
gave you the other day was good, this is still better. Say to it, 
“Little-Club, strike!’” He sent the children in, and said he was 
going out. When he returned, they were all bruised. He said, 
“All that I, my wife and children, have suffered, the king must 
suffer too.” He went towards the king’s house. The king did 
not wait to be asked to laugh with him; he began to laugh a week 
before he arrived. Wolf said to the king, “If that dangainha was 
good, this little club is still better. Call all the royal family 
together. Say, ‘Little-Club, strike!’ I'll go out here.” The 
king sent for all, and said, “Little-Club, strike!” Outside Wolf 
heard them calling for him. “Wolf, Wolf, tell it to stop or it 
will kill us!” Wolf said, “How about it, Sir King, will the 
bangainha you got from me show up?” The king sent one of his 
daughters for the dangainha he had locked up. Little-Club saw 
her go, and went after her and beat her. She brought back the

bangainha. Wolf took it, and asked it for something to eat. 
Little-Club was still beating them all. “Stop it, or it will kill 
us!” —“No, Sir King, bear it with patience! Three days you 
kept me hungry.” When Little-Club stopped, nobody there had 
his natural color. 
Wolf took Little-Club and Bangainha home. Three weeks 
before he got there, his wife asked him for the dangainha. They 
asked the dangainha for so much, it gave out, gave forth only 
wind. They threw it away, and kept only the little club. Wolf 
was troubled about his big stomach, troubled how to carry it. 
He said to Little-Club, “By the virtue God gives you, beat me on 
my stomach. Make me a man who eats no more than anybody 
else.” Little-Club beat him on the stomach, and made a hand- 
some man of him. The dirty water in his belly ran out, it ran to 
the sea, it ran for seven weeks. People passing by asked him 
how he came to be so handsome. A boy called him by name. He 
was dissatisfied with his name. He said, “From now on nobody 
is to call me Wolf. Call me Jon di Aguas Perdidas [John of 
Lost Waters].” :

together with the meaning “little wand;” but in Fogo the original meaning has been lost. In San Nicolao a mermaid is called sere’na (“siren”). A Brava woman in Nantucket who

him a twist of hair. He said, “Maria Condon, by the virtue 
God gives you, fill me this rock with soup, and a bone in the 
bottom for me to dive to get.”1 As soon as he asked it, the rock 
filled with soup, with a bone at the bottom. Wolf was satisfied, 
he let Maria Condon go. He gathered a bundle of wood, he 
asked ? his Maria Condon to mount him on the bundle of wood to 
take him home. When he got on top of the wood, it carried him 
towards home. He passed by the house of the king. The prin- 
cess was sitting on the verandah. The princess said, “Oh, what a 
fool to ride on wood!” * The princess scorned him. He said to 
his Maria Condon, “‘By the virtue God gives you, in nine months 
make the princess bear me a son with a gold star on his head, and 
a gold apple in his hand.” 
After a while the princess appeared pregnant. The king was 
highly grieved, he covered the palace with black. Nobody knew 
how the princess came to be pregnant. After nine months a 
child was born with a gold star on its head and a gold apple in its 
hand. The king summoned all the men of the city to come to the 
palace. He said that he whom the child gave the apple‘ to 
would be its father. All came, but to none of them did the child 
give the apple. The priest § said to the king, “There is one man 
missing, Mr. Wolf.” The king said to him, “Wolf is not a per- 
son.” The priest asked the king to send for him, at any rate. 
Then the king sent four officers to get him; but Wolf refused to 
go with them, because he knew why they had come to get him, 
he was afraid the king would kill him. Then the king sent 
twelve officers after him, with orders to bring him or his head.* 
He came. As soon as he reached the door of the palace, the child 
reached him the apple. The king was sad, but he had to marry 
him to his daughter. Then Wolf took the princess with him. 
He asked his Maria Condon to make him a shelter so small that 
they would have to live in it half in, half out. (He wanted to 
punish the princess.) When they went into the shelter, the

princess said to him,! “Why don’t you ask your Maria Condon 
to make you a palace like the king’s or better?”—“No, never! 
J want to pay you back for what you did to me.” At meal-time 
he asked his Maria Condon to give him a tub full of soup made 
out of a single bean, and with one bean at the bottom. The 
princess said to him, “Why don’t you ask your Maria Condon to 
make you eat like people, and at the same time to make you into 
a fine, handsome man?” He said, “I'd die if I ate a little.” 
But next day he asked Maria Condon to make him into a fine, 
handsome boy,? and to make him eat like people. The princess 
was pleased. That night he asked Maria Condon to make him a 
high house (sobrad’) of seven stories, higher than the king’s, 
The next morning the king saw the sobrad’, he asked who had the 
impudence to make a sobrad’ higher than his. They told him 
that it was Wolf, his son-in-law. Then he could do nothing to 
him. (Had it belonged to any other fellow, he would have sent 
and killed him.) 
Wolf wanted to kill the king, to become king in his place. He 
invited the king and all the citizens to dinner When they were 
all seated at the table, he asked his Maria Condon to put a spoon 
in the king’s pocket. They did not see the spoon, the spoon dis- 
appeared. The king said, “Let us search, and let him upon whom 
the spoon is found be hanged!” They searched all but the king. 
The king said, “Search me too! Jam aman like youall.” They 
searched him, in his pocket they found the spoon. Everybody 
was troubled, and begged him to save himself. ‘‘No,” said he, 
“my word is one.” 5 Then they hung him. Wolf became king * 
in his place. 
1 Variant; At the jantar de casament’ (“the marriage dinner”) Wolf puts the bones 
in his pocket, to the disgust of the princess. That night the princess weeps. “Don’t 
weep!” says Wolf, “I act like a wolf, but J am aman like any other man.” But she weeps 
till dawn. Then, when she sleeps, Wolf asks to be turned into a delicad’ (“refined”) 
man, speaking as properly as a Portuguese from Lisbon. 
2 Variant: By makihg him a better-looking man than the brother of the princess. 
When he and the princess pay a visit to the king, the king thinks she is not with the man 
he married her to, and so he says he is going to kill her.

Wolf said it was a shame to have relatives like Nephew. He 
sent to have all nephews killed. One escaped up a tree in Wolf’s 
yard. Of all the nephews, he alone was not caught. Wolf sent 
to get a cow to be killed in his yard near the tree. He sat watch~ 
ing it. By this time he had become like a man, except that his 
greediness was still in him. Nephew looked down. He said, 
“Head, hoofs, tail, hide,— all are for my Uncle Wolf.” Nephew 
said again, “Head, hoofs, tail, hide,— all are for my Uncle Wolf.”” 
Wolf was so pleased, he said, ““This voice sounds like my nephew’s. 
I sent and killed all the nephews, but this voice is like his voice.”” 
Nephew said again, “Head, hoofs, tail, hide,— all are for my 
Uncle Wolf.” Then Wolf looked up, he saw Nephew. He said, 
“Nephew, come down! I am going to take you into my house, 
I am going to take you into my service. You are a good nephew. 
J am not going to kill you. You remind me of old times.” That’s 
the end.

said she would not marry any one but a man born with gold 
teeth. A year later a man appeared in the city born with gold 
teeth. He was the Devil. She saw him, she liked him. She

were married, they set out for another country.. They travelled 
for three months without reaching home. In the fifth month 
they came to a mountain five hundred thousand leagues away. 
In the mountain was a hole. When he went into it, he turned 
into a snake. He rolled himself around her, he unrolled himself

months, The girl came out of the hole, she sat down on the side 
of the mountain. Within an hour she saw a herdsman about five 
miles away. She sang,— 
“ Turkey-herd, turkey-herd, 
When you go, tell Sir King and Lady Queen 
How the man they married me to 
Is not a person, is a snake beyond on the mountain, 
There on the mountain.” 
The herdsman did not hear her. A turkey heard. The turkey, 
when he reached the court of the king, sang,— 
“Sir King and Lady Queen, 
Your daughter sent me to tell you 
That the man you married her to 
Is not a person, is a snake beyond on the mountain, 
There on the mountain.” 
Everybody was astonished, nobody understood him. The king 
sent for the said’ to come and divine what Turkey said. The 
king said that to him who would bring home his daughter to 
him, he would give half of his fortune. The said’ got together 
Eater, Shooter, and Seer. They embarked on a boat, they went 
to sea. When they arrived at the mountain, they found the 
snake still asleep. They carried the girl away with them. Five 
hours later the time came for the snake to awake. He did not 
see the girl. He came out of the hole, he saw the ship sailing 
literally, “running”] away. He went after it. The said’ divined 
that he was coming after them. About five leagues off, Seer 
saw him, he pointed him out to Shooter. Shooter shot, he blew 
him into pieces. He got together again, he went after the ship. 
This time the ship was near the shore. Shooter shot again. He 
blew up. Where he fell there was a fire, so he could not recover 
himself. They took the girl to her parents’ house. To this day 
they are still there living in wisdom. The king divided his wealth 
with the said’ and the others. After he died, there was no heir 
to his riches. To-day they are scattered the world over.

Then Bluejay passed by. She said to Bluejay,— 
“When you go, 
You tell my mother, 
Tell my father, 
That the person they married me to 
That he was no person at all. 
He was Sir Snake beyond on the mountain. 
Beyond on the mountain, beyond, 
Beyond on the mountain, beyond. 
4i, my mother! ui! 
i, my father! ui!” 
Then Falcon passed by. She said to him, “Falcon with golden 
feathers, give a message, a message golden as your feathers are 
golden.” Then Falcon came, he gave the message. The woman 
made ready to go. She went with Diviner, Taker, and Smeller. 
That day was the day Snake went to plan for all his companions 
to come and kill his wife. He came, he found the house empty, 
his wife was not there; but he did not go to look for her in the 
house of her mother and father, because he knew that the daughter, 
as soon as she arrived, would tell her mother and father that he 
was not a person, that he was a snake. 
(Variant b2) 
There was a woman and a man had three sons and one daughter. 
They raised the children so well, that they thought nothing could 
touch them. All the girl’s friends married. Her mother said 
to her, “All your friends are married, why don’t you get married?”

The girl said to her, “No, I won’t marry until I meet a man with 
gold teeth.”—“You will never marry, for you will never meet 
such a man.” 
One day the eldest brother came home, he told his mother that 
his sister had a suitor. The suitor came, he told the mother and 
father that he wanted to marry their daughter. The girl said to 
them, “This is my husband, whether my mother likes it, or my 
father likes it.” The father said to her, “Go marry him!” The 
girl said, ““No, I won’t marry him until you tell him for sure that 
he will be a son of the house.” Her eldest brother said, “Marry 
him if you like him!” The mother and father of the bride gave a 
feast and entertainment. They entertained until three in the 
morning. She left with her husband. 
The eldest brother began to think his sister had married a 
man she did not know. His father asked him, “Did you know 
that man?”—“No, we only saw him when he came here.” He 
said to his father, ““My father, I am going out into the world to 
look until I find our sister.” 1

Once there was a great famine in the land.* Wolf said to Pedr’, 
“Pedr’, better let us sell our mothers for corn!”—‘Yes, sir!” 
Pedr’ said, “Your mother is stronger than mine. Tie her with a 
rope of coconut; I'll tie mine with the warp.” Pedr’ said to 
his mother, “My mother, I have arranged with Wolf for us to go 
to town to sell our mothers for corn. When we go to a certain 
place, do. you pull away, escape, go home!”” Then Pedr’s mother 
escaped and ran away. Pedr’ said to Wolf, ‘We had better plan 
to sell your mother, let us use her first; then I will catch my 
mother, we will go sell her.”* They went on to a place where

hungry for three days. (Fogo.) . ; . 
‘4 Variant: Wolf, who had his mother tied on a four-inch rope (or the biggest rope in the 
world), warns Nephew that his mother will jerk away. When she does, Wolf says he is

there were people.’ There they sold Wolf’s mother for four sacks 
of corn. Wolf got donkeys, he loaded the corn on their backs. 
He told Pedr’ to go ahead with the donkeys. Pedr’ went with 
the donkeys to the mud on the side of the river. He cut off the 
tails of the donkeys, he buried them in the mud, he left their tips 
out. Then he turned back, he called to Wolf that the donkeys 
were buried in the river. Wolf took off his coat. He said, “I 
will pull them out.” He took hold of a tail. Pedr’ took hold too, 
he made out he was helping; but as Wolf pulled up, Nephew 
pulled down. After a little, Pedr’ let go on the tail, Wolf fell into 
the river. He was drowned? 
39.2 THE RIVAL BROTHERS: WHO GETS ANGRY FIRST: 
. BURIED TAIL, 
There was a man matried to a woman, had three sons. One 
day the two older sons told their father they wanted to go out 
into the world to look for something to relate. “My sons, 
what do you want to take with you?”—‘‘Money and a horse.” 
He gave each a sack of money and a horse. They went, went, 
went. They reached the house of a princess, into which none 
entered. The servant refused to let them in. : 
Now, the youngest son (coude) said he wanted to go out into the 
_ world to look for something to relate. ‘“‘My son, what do you 
want to take with you ?”” —“I want a blessing from my father and 
mother to take with me.” His father gave him a blessing, also 
a sack of money and a horse. He went to the house of his god-

2 Variants: (a) Nephew drives donkeys to a cliff; and there in the side, in a hole, the 
nest of a bluejay (passadinha), he buries the tail. He returns disguised to Wolf, who asks 
if he has seen his donkey, and if he will help him look for it.... ‘Look! there is a tail,’ 
says Nephew.... ‘All the donkeys have gone into this hole.” As Wolf falls backward 
over the cliff, he calls to Nephew to put a mattress down for him. The mattress Nephew 
lays for him is one of knives, broken glass, etc... . (seep. 11). (Fogo.)

to kill mine, and mine has killed yours because yours was greedy.” (This variant is 
spliced into “‘Wolf’s Nephew makes Wolf his Horse.”) (Fogo.) 
(©) Nephew leads the donkeys off the road. He returns to meet Wolf. He stands in 
the road with his mouth and his eyes wide open (“making a face”). Wolf does not 
recognize him. Wolf asks, “‘Sir Open-Mouthed [’VAa’ Reganhad’], did you see Nephew?” 
Nephew misdirects him. (Fogo.) .

mother. “Godmother, I have come for a blessing, because I am 
going out into the world to look for something to relate.” She 
gave him her blessing. He started to go. She called him back: 
“Godson, come back! I have a remembrance for you.” ° She 
gave him three handkerchiefs,— one the color of the moon, one 
the color of the sun, one the color of the stars. He went, went, 
went. He reached the house of the princess, he asked for shelter. 
The princess told the servant to let him in, but to let him stand 
in the vestibule. He asked for a drink of water. With the 
handkerchief the color of the sun he wiped his mouth. The 
servant ran to the princess: ““O Mistress! I have seen something 
you do not possess and never will possess.”—‘‘What is it?”— 
“The handkerchief that man wipes his mouth with.”——“Tell him 
I will buy it from him.” He said, “I will not sell it, I will give 
it toher.” She sent him a chair to sit on. After half an hour he 
asked for a drink of lemonade. He wiped his mouth with the 
handkerchief the color of the stars. The servant ran to the 
princess: “O Mistress! if the handkerchief he gave you was fine, 
this is still finer.” —“ Buy it from him.” He said, “I don’t sell, I 
give.” After half an hour he asked again for a drink of lemonade. 
He wiped his mouth with the handkerchief the color of the moon. 
The servant said to the princess, ““O Mistress! if the other two 
were fine, this is quadruple [redod/aa’] fine.” She told the servant 
to let him come in. The boy (mos’) went to the door of the room 
of the princess and talked with her. His brothers arrived. He 
told her they were his brothers. She sent for them. They 
marvelled that their brother had been received when they had 
been denied. The youngest asked the princess to marry him. His 
brothers asked her too. She said, “I am only one. J cannot 
marry three. Go out into the world. Him who acquires most 
knowledge and most skill I will marry.” 
They started out. After six months they came to cross-roads 
and separated. The eldest went on, he got the present (prenda) 
of a spread (colcha) that could transport him in four minutes over 
‘the way he had come in six months. The second got the present 
of a mirror which showed the past. The youngest got the present 
of a candle which gave life to the dead. After eight days they 
returned to the place where they separated. The eldest said, 
“My present is this spread.” The second said, “My present 1s 
this mirror.” The third said, ““My present is this candle.” 
The second looked in his mirror, he saw that the princess was

dead. He was upset. “None of us will marry the princess,” 
said he. ‘‘What we expected, we shall not have.” The owner 
of the spread said, “The road we walked for six months we can 
cover in four minutes. For what is your present?” —“‘To give 
life to the dead.” The eldest brother beat his spread; in four 
minutes they were in the house of the princess. The youngest 
brother put his candle in her hand, she came back to life. She 
arose; she embraced the youngest brother; she said to him, “You 
are my husband.” The second brother said, ‘‘It is me you should 
marry. But for me, they would not have known you were dead.” 
The eldest said, “It is me you should marry. But for me, we 
were not here before six months, and then you would have been 
in your grave.” The youngest said, “But I have given you life.” 
She said, ““He is my husband. He gave me life. As for you two, 
I will give you work.”—‘‘No, but for us, you would not be alive, 
and now you want us to work for you like a Negro.” But they 
could not help themselves; so one became a cowherd, and the 
other a pigherd. Year in and year out the cows failed to increase, 
because the cowherd killed the calves. Nor did the pigs increase, 
because the pigherd killed the little pigs. When the princess and 
her husband saw that the men worked so indifferently, they paid 
them off and sent them away. 
They walked to another city. They went up to a house and 
asked for work. To the one the man gave a herd of goats; to 
the other, work on his grounds. The man was a demon. He 
wanted to kill the goatherd. He told him to take the goats to a 
distant place. He went, went, went, until the goats were ex- 
hausted and fell dead. When the last goat died, he returned. 
Demon asked him if he had taken the goats where he had directed. 
He said, “Yes.”” Demon sent him to work under a cliff. Ata 
certain point in the cliff he told him to poke his head out. He 
put his hat on a goat’s head and poked it out. Demon hurled a 
rock and cut off the goat’s head. “I’ve killed that rascal!’ 
He returned home to find there the man he thought he had killed. 
“You here! I thought you were dead when that stone fell.”— 
“TI just escaped.” He sent him to work on a farm far away. 
With him he sent a dog, saying, ‘“‘ The one who returns to the house 
first will get the food. The one of us who gets angry will take a 
strip out of the side of the other.” He and the dog worked; 
they ran, ran, ran, and both arrived together. They ate. The 
next day, the same. The third day the dog outran him, reached

the house, and ate all the food. He was angry, but he did not 
show it. The next day the boss (patron) sent them to work. 
Time to quit. As soon as the dog put down his hoe (inchaa’), he 
took his hoe and killed the dog. He came home and ate alone. 
The next day the boss gave him a lot of pigs to take to a friend, 
writing to the friend to take the pigs to a corral by the river. He 
walked, walked, walked. He went to a muddy place, where he 
cut off the tails of all the pigs, he stuck them into the mud, leav- 
ing out only the tips. He returned and told the boss that the 
pigs had stuck. The boss started out with him to find the pigs. 
The man said, “Take hold of the tail and pull. I will not pull, 
because I tried in vain before I went home.” Demon grabbed a 
tail, he jerked it out, he tumbled over on his head in the mud. 
The man was pleased. He went back to the house. He sent for 
his brother. There they live to this day. 
4ot WHO GETS ANGRY FIRST: THE BRAVE BOY. 
There was a man had three sons. The man was aged. His 
first son, Manuel, said, “Father, I want you to give me a blessing, 
and I will go out into the world to find a fortune to support you.” 
His father gave him a blessing. He set out, he walked all day, he 
came to a man’s house. He asked, “‘Is there anything I can do to 
get money to help my old father?” The man answered, “I have 
a little work for you, but it must be done under contract. I will 
send you to work with some one. The one of us who gets angry 
first, the other will kill.” The first day he sent him to work, he 
sent him with a dog. He said, ‘When I whistle to you, come for 
a meal.” He gave him some gufong? As he was busy working, 
the dog ran and ate up the gufong. Then he heard the man 
whistle. The dog ran on ahead of him. The dog ate up all the 
dinner. They washed the plate, and left it standing for him, 
the dish-water in it. When he arrived, the man said, “My dog 
came and ate up everything.”—“Do you think Dll eat with a 
dog!” §—“You are angry,” said the man. He pulled his gun 
and shot him. . / 
Jon, the second son, asked his father for a blessing and set 
forth. He came to the same house, he had the same experience.

The third son, Pedr’, said, ‘My two brothers went, and have 
not returned. I do not know where they are. I am going.”’-— 
“No, you are the last. Your two brothers went, and did not 
return.’”—“I am going. With faith in God, I shall return.” 
His father gave him a blessing. He walked all day. He reached 
the same house. ‘Is there anything I can do to get money to 
help my old father?” —“TI have a little work for you, but it must 
be done under contract.” —“ That is just what I am looking for.” 
—‘T will send you to work with my dog. The one of us who gets 
angry first, the other will kill.” When Pedr’ went to work with 
the dog, he watched the dog. When the dog made for the gufong, 
he grabbed it. He said to the dog, “If you want gufong, set to 
work, and I will give you some.” He tied the dog toa tree. He 
heard the whistle. He started for the house. The dog broke 
the rope, and started too for the house. The dog ran so fast, 
he saw he would beat him. With a stone he broke his leg. He 
saw the dog would beat him, at any rate: so he seized him, and 
killed him on a stone. The man said, “Well, Pedr’, where is 
my dog? It is strange. Every day the dog gets here first.”— 
“Your dog is back of the house. He tried to run in ahead of me, 
and I killed him. Are you angry?”—‘‘No. I will raise another 
dog.”’! 
The man said, ‘To-morrow you are to take my goats to pasture 
with the kids. You must bring them back without their 
suckling their dams,? nevertheless on their return they must come 
laughing and dancing.” When the boy reached the pasture, 
he cut the upper lips of all the goats, and broke one of their legs. 
He cut out the tongues of the kids. On his return the man asked, 
“Flow are the goats? Are they laughing and dancing? and 
without being milked?”—“‘Yes, I cut out the tongues of the kids. 
The goats are laughing because I cut their lips. They are dan- 
cing because I broke their legs....Are you angry?”—‘‘Oh, no! 
I will raise more goats.” The man added, “To-morrow you must 
take out to pasture the cows and the calves. Without being 
milked, they must return laughing and dancing.” He took them 
to pasture, he cut out the tongues of the calves, the upper lips 
of the cows he cut, and one of their legs he broke. On his return 
he said to the man, “You wanted to see them laughing and dan-

cing. There they come! Are you angry?”—“Oh, no! I will 
raise more cows.” 
The man added, “To-morrow we start hoeing. There will be 
twenty men to hoe. The heaviest hoe you will have.” In the 
fields the others raced to see who could hoe the most. At noon, 
when their dinner was sent out to them, there was one spoon short. 
Some one started to get a spoon. The boy said, “No, I am the 
fleetest. I will get it.’ When he reached the house, he said 
nothing about the spoon; but to the man’s three daughters (the 
man was out in the field) he said, “Your father says I am to lie 
with you three. If you doubt it, call out to him and ask.” The 
first girl called, “Father, did you say that?” The man answered, 
“Yes, I say so.” The second girl called, “Father, did you say 
that?”—“Yes, I say so.” The third girl called, “Father, did 
you say that?”’-—“Yes, I say so.” He lay with them) Then he 
took the spoon. 
That night the man’s wife said to him, “You better get rid of 
that boy. He ruins your animals, he disgraces our daughters. 
He will kill us both. You better get rid of him.” The man said, 
“T will settle him. I will tell him that to-morrow he is to lasso 
some wild horses. Do you crow like a rooster, crow before mid- 
night. I will tell him that when the rooster crows, he must leave. 
The Devil (diogo)? will get him; I will tell him when the rooster 
crows, he must start.” She crowed before midnight. “Get up, 
Pedr’! the rooster is crowing.” —‘‘No, I have all my prayers still 
to say. If that rooster crows again, I am going to get up and 
kill him.” She was up in a tree. She crowed again. He got 
his gun and shot her dead. Out came the man, saying, “You 
have killed my wife.’”—‘‘No, I have killed a rooster, not your 
wife, unless that was your wife crowing up there like a rooster. 
Then I have killed her. Are you angry?” ? 
The man said, ‘To-morrow you are going with Diog’ to feed 
the goats.” The next day on his way he came across a bird. 
It was a chinchirote. He picked it up and put it in his pocket. 
He went on a little way, and he came across a stick of rotten wood. 
He picked it up and put it in his pocket. When he reached the

pasture, he met Diog’. He said, “A man sent me here to tend the 
goats with you.”—“All right! Do you want to see tricks you 
never saw before?” —“ You can’t do anything I can’t do. Goon, 
I'd like to see what you can do.” Diog’ said, “I can take these 
stones and break them up as fine as hominy [sheren].” He picked. 
up the stones, he rubbed them in his hands, he showed them the 
size of hominy. “You are doing well. I am going to throw a 
stone in the air, and it will never come back.” They waited there 
three days for the bird to return. He said, ‘There is something 
else I can.do. I can turn a stone into corn-meal [farinha di 
milha].”’ From his pocket he took the rotten stick, he rubbed it, 
he showed it to Diog’ as corn-meal. Diog’ said, “To-morrow do 
you go up to catch goats, and I will go down. When I call, just 
show your head.”’ When Diog’ called, Pedr’ showed him the 
head of a ram instead of his own head. Diog’ shot and killed the 
ram. Pedr’ stole back to where Diog’ was. ‘‘How are you, 
Diog’?”—“Wasn’t it you I killed a few minutes ago?” —‘‘No, 
it was your biggest ram you killed.”—“To-night,” said Diog’, 
“‘you are to lie among the dead [finad’].” They went to the 
house of Diog’. Corpses lay about. Pedr’ took a corpse lying 
on a bench and placed it on the floor with the others. He lay 
in its place on the bench, the only vacant spot in the place. 
Diog’ came with a red-hot iron and killed his own fined’, thinking 
it was Pedr’. The next morning Pedr’ went, and said, “How are 
you, Diog’?” —“Wasn’t it you I killed last night?” —‘‘No, it was 
the biggest fizad’ you had there you killed.” —‘O Pedr’! you know 
more than I do. I have tried as hard as I can to kill you, but I 
can’t kill you. Let us divide all I have here!”—-“What is your 
name?”—“My name is Two-Holes-under-the-Table.” 
Pedr’ took his half and went to the king! When the king 
saw him, he said, “Diog’ did not kill him. He will kill me.” 
To Pedr’ he said, “To-morrow I want you to go out and catch a 
wild horse and ride him to me.” Pedr’ went and caught the 
horse. The horse was so wild, he shot him. The king asked, 
“Did you bring the horse?”—‘‘Yes. The horse tried to kill me, 
so I killed him. You don’t like it?” —“‘No.” Then Pedr’ pulled 
out his gun and shot him. He took possession of everything, 
and sent for his father to come and live with him. They spent 
a good life.

41, THE BRAVE Boy! 
There was a woman married toa man. They had a son called 
Jon Brandan. His father died. One day Jon started out to look 
for work. He came to the house of a man who was a hunter. He 
asked for work. The hunter gave him the place of cook. The 
hunter lost a day hunting to show him how he wanted the cooking 
done. Next day he went hunting, he left the boy at home to 
cook. There was a bottle of molasses on the table. The boy 
spilled it. The flies gathered. He took a stick and struck from 
side to side. With one stroke he killed seven flies, with another 
he killed fourteen. He did no cooking. The hunter returned, 
and said to him, “What were you doing? You did not cook.” 
He answered, “I was hunting.”—“What?”—“I was hunting 
more than you.”-—“T got seven chickens.”——“I got more than you; 
I got twenty-one, you got seven.”—‘‘Show me your chickens!” 
He showed him the twenty-one flies. He said to him, “I killed 
seven with a blow, and I killed fourteen with a cut.” The next 
morning the hunter left him to cook. He was too lazy to work. 
He didn’t cook, he caught flies. When the hunter returned, he 
found no dinner. He kicked him behind, he kicked him out of 
doors. There on a pile of ashes he slept all night. The next 
morning, when the hunter found him asleep on the ashes, on his 
back he chalked, “Jon Brandan, he kills seven with a blow, and 
fourteen with a cut.” 
There was a king who had been waging a war for seven years. 
People passing by saw the boy with the writing on his back. 
They sent word to the king that here was a boy who killed seven 
with a blow and fourteen with a cut. The king sent for him, he 
forced him to go to war; he agreed that, if he won, he would marry 
him to his daughter and give him half his kingdom. He gave 
him a silk handkerchief, he told him to go to the stable and to 
take the first horse to come when he waved the handkerchief. 
He had never ridden a horse. He had never seen a cock-fight, 
much less a battle. He went to the stable and waved his hand- 
kerchief. A horse advanced. “No, not you, you would kill me.” 
He waved again, another horse advanced. ‘‘Nor you, either.” 
A little horse with a broken leg was there, but he did not come 
forward. Jon went up to him, and said, “It is you I will take.” 
The king said, “‘No, you must not take him.” And the king

brought him another horse. When he mounted the king’s horse, 
he held on to the saddle back and front. News of the man who 
had killed seven at one blow and fourteen at one cut travelled to 
the seat of war. As soon as the horse heard the sound of guns 
and of drums, he started to run. The boy, not knowing how to 
ride, began to howl, “‘Now shall I die, and now shall I defecate!”” 
The men against him understood him to say, ‘“‘Now shall they die, 
and now shall they defecate!” The horse started to run towards 
them, where there was a flag. Seeing him, they deserted the flag 
and ran away. The horse, accustomed to war, went straight to 
the flag. The boy seized it. As soon as the horse saw that the 
boy had the flag, he turned, and ran for the king’s house. The 
king and queen, and the girl who was to be his wife, came out and 
’ embraced him. They all rejoiced. They are still alive and well 
to-day. His wife never learned the donkey he was. I am the 
only one who can give an account of him, because we were raised

In olden time there was a man who understood animals. The 
servant of this man took the ox out every day to work on the soil. 
One day he brought the ox home, he put him in the stall, he gave 
him a ration of beans? to eat. As the ox was very tired, he 
lowered his head, he did not eat. The boss had also a donkey 
he rode. This donkey saw that he did not eat; he asked, “What 
is the matter with you, that you are so sad?”—-“I have every 
reason to be sad,” answered the ox. “I work hard every day, and 
this boy beats me. You are different; you stay here in the stall, 
you eat what you like and when you like; clean and well treated, 
you ought to be satisfied, but not I.”—‘‘Oh, what a fool you are!”? 
exclaimed the donkey, “what a quadruped!”—“‘I can’t help it,”’ 
answered the ox, “J have to go to work when they say so.”’—‘‘ Not 
at all,” answered the donkey, “you don’t have to work. If it 
was me, nobody could make me go out to work. You have two 
big horns, and you don’t know how to use them. To-morrow, 
when the servant comes for you to go out, you just hold back, 
butt in the stall, act wild!” So the ox said, “To-morrow I will

try that.” While they were talking, the boss was at the door of 
the barn; he heard all, he broke out laughing. The next day in 
the morning, when the servant came to take out the ox, it began 
to butt, it acted wild. The boy was startled, he was frightened; 
he did not take the ox out of the stall, he went to the house. On 
his way he met the boss. “You are not taking the ox out to-day 
to work?” asked the boss. “No, sir!” answered the boy, “the 
ox is acting wild in his stall, it is sick or mad.” The boss answered, 
“Well, since the ox is sick, take the donkey to work.” So the 
servant took out the donkey, he put the yoke on his neck, he took 
him to work. The donkey refused to work, the boy beat him. 
At night he took the donkey to the stall. The donkey saw that 
the ox was feeling good. He stood with his head down, his 
ears drooping. The ox asked, “To-day it is you who are discon- 
tented?” The donkey said, “How can I be contented under this 
work? I don’t blame you; I blame myself, because the man who 
gives his secret away to another is a fool.”1 At this time the 
boss and his wife were sitting at the door of the stall. He began 
to laugh. The donkey asked the ox, “What are you going to do 
to-morrow?” —“TI am going to do the same thing you taught 
me to do.”—“If you knew what I heard, you better get ready to 
go to work to-morrow.”—‘‘What have you heard?”—“If you do 
what you did to-day, they will kill you to get your liver to feed 
the poor, your hide to give to the shoemaker.” At this the boss 
exploded. The woman asked him, “Whatever are you laughing 
about, are you crazy, or what?”—“If you only understood these 
animals as well as I, you’d be laughing too.”—‘‘ Don’t tell me it is 
about the animals, it is some girl that you have in your mind.”— 
“Not at all,” answered the man, “I was laughing at those ani- 
mals.” The woman said to him, “If you don’t tell mé what you 
are laughing about, you will not come into my bed to-night.” 
The man answered, “J cannot tell you.” They began to quarrel 
until they went into the house. 
The next day the woman asked him again, “What were you 
laughing about?” Still her husband would not tell her. The 
woman said, “If you don’t tell me, I’m not going to do a thing. 
I won’t cook, I won’t work. I'll not do a thing in the house.” 
4 Variant: The master (don’) owns a quarry. The ox and the horse pull. the cart; the donkey, the master rides.... After pulling the cart-load of stones, the donkey is in his turn too tired to eat, will not even look at his fodder. “What’s the matter with you?” 
asks Ox. “Shut up!” answers Donkey. ‘‘It was pride caused me to be put to work.” - (Boa Vista.)

She kept on being angry for three days. The husband sent for her 
father and mother. Just the same, they could do nothing with her. 
“T’ll not keep such a woman in my house, I’m going to send her to 
the gallows.” He sent to call the hangman. “Take this wife of 
mine to the gallows. I can’t keep her any longer.” ? 
Just then the dog was lying on the verandah. In the yard there 
strutted a cock among fifty hens. The dog asked the cock, 
“Don’t you know the news?”—“I know nothing.”—‘“‘ Don’t 
you know that our mistress is going to the gallows? Here you 
are still strutting about!” The cock answered, “I, I can’t 
help it. It is obligatory upon me to strut among the hens. Why 
do they send the mistress to the gallows?”—‘‘Because of her 
persistence.” —‘“‘Is that all? Is it just for that they are sending 
her to the gallows? Is there, then, no cure for that?” The dog 
answered, “No, we don’t know any. We’ve been looking for a 
cure. We can’t find any at all.” —“That’s strange!” he 
exclaimed. ‘‘A man can’t rule one woman! J have fifty females 
here, every one of them pays attention when I call them.” The 
dog asked, “Can you tell us a cure?”—“Yes, if it was me, ’d 
lock her up in a room, I’d beat her until she called on God.” 
The boss was standing at the door, he overheard all the talk. He 
turned to the hangman; he said to him, ‘“‘Wait until to-morrow 
before you begin to carry out the order.” . 
That night the boss sent every one early to bed. He locked 
up his wife in a room. He took a whip to whip her. The more 
she cried, the more he whipped. She knelt on the ground with 
her hands clasped in prayer; she begged him, “For the love of 
God, do not whip me any more! I'll ask you no more questions, 
never again will I question you about such things.” Her hus- 
band said, “Make a cross* not to speak to me about it the rest 
1 Variant: For three days the wife will not eat. Her husband says to her, “You insist 
on my telling you what I was laughing about. I will tell you, but it will be the last day of my life.” (He understood the speech of all the animals of the world, but, if he revealed 
it, he had to die.) “Invite my godfather and godmother to dinner, invite my friends and 
neighbors.” (Boa Vista.) 
2 Variant: A hen says to the rooster, “You have no sense, to go about to-day so well 
satisfied. Don’t you know our master is about to die? He is about to die because he is 
an ass. He has only one woman. I have eighteen. If any one of them does anything 
to me, I take a whip to her.” (Boa Vista.) 
2 It is a common custom in the Islands to make a lifelong vow by making a cross on the 
floor or wall, or even by cutting it on one’s hand. In the house of a Brava family living 
at Onset, Mass-, Crosses cut in the woodwork were pointed out to me as charms against — 
witches, and the Americanized adult daughter of the family wore a gold cross hung around 
her neck for the $ame reason, There is a Fogo legend that once a man quarrelling with 
another said, “If IT want to kill you, who will prevent me?” The other answered, “God;””

of your life.” Straightway she made a cross. From then on she 
became a good wife. Never again did she do anything contrary 
to her husband.? 
That was the judgment of the cock. 
(Variant a.2) 
There was a man who understood every animal. One day he 
sent the servant to go to work with the ox. When the ox returned, 
he told the donkey that he was very tired, that the servant beat 
him alot. The donkey said to him, “When he comes to give you 
food, don’t eat; when he gives you water, don’t drink; to-morrow 
he won’t go to work with you.”” At daybreak the following morn- 
ing he went and got water and food, which he gave the ox. All 
there, he did not eat it. He went to the boss. He told him the 
food and water he gave the ox were all there, he did not eat it, 
he thought he was sick. The boss said to him, “Take out the 
donkey, go to work with him.” He went. When it got late, 
he came back with the donkey. The donkey said to the ox, “I 
am tired, he whipped me, I worked hard, I am all done up. Now, 
T heard them say that if you don’t go to work to-morrow, they 
will have you killed.” At daybreak the following morning the 
hens and the cock got up. The man’s wife was disgracing him. 
The cock said to the hens, “See how I control you all, and he with 
only one wife cannot control her?’ The man heard, he began to 
laugh. The woman wanted him to tell her why he was laughing. 
It was a secret that he could not tell any one. Then the woman 
began to tease him too much, he beat her, he did as the cock told 
him. From now on they lived all right, his wife teased him no 
more. 
438 WHO EATS MOST: ESCAPE UP THE TREE. 
There was a man had three sons,— Pal’, Pedr’, and Mané José. 
The father fell sick. Pal’ said to him, “My father, I am going 
whereupon the roadside cross near which they stood moved down from its base of stones 
a short distance, and then returned to its place. It is also said in the Islands that lava- 
flows leave their course to avoid the wayside crosses. 
1 Variant: After the dinner-guests have left, the woman sits down in her husband’s 
lap, and says, “My husband, I have done all you told me. Now tell me why you laughed.” 
He gets his whip and lashes her on the back. ‘‘No, no, husband! I did not ask for this. 
I asked you to tell me why you laughed.” — “This is all I have to tell you.” She twists 
and turns. As he goes on lashing, she cries, “If it was this, I don’t want to hear it.”

to the end of the world to find you a cure.”—“ My son, the end 
of the world is very far. Who goes there never comes back.”” 
Pal’ said, “I am going, and I am coming back.” The father 
asked, ““Which do you want,—a sack of money, or a sack of 
blessings?” —‘‘A sack of money, J don’t need a sack of blessings.”’ 
He [the father] gave him a sack of money. He [Pal’] mounted his 
horse; he rode, rode, until he came to the house of Old Lady. 
“O my.grandson! where are you going, what do you want?”’— 
“T am looking for a cure for my father, who is sick.” Old Lady 
said to him, “I am going to set you to eat with my daughter. 
Who eats the less I will kill.” This old woman had three daugh- 
ters, all looking alike. When the first daughter ate until she could 
eat no more, she went to get more food; the second sister brought 
it in. They ate, ate, until she could eat no more. She went to 
look for more food; in came the youngest. Pal’ could eat no 
more. The old woman said, “Come! Let me show you my 
house with seven keys!” She opened six doors. When they 
came to the seventh, she said to him, “This one you open!” She 
had a deep place there, she pushed him into it. 
Pedr’ said, ‘““My father, I am going to the end of the world to 
find you a cure.”—“My son, the end of the world is very far. 
Who goes there never comes back.” Pedr’ said, “I am going, and 
I am coming back.” The father asked him, ““Which do you 
want,— a sack of money, or a sack of blessings?’”’” Pedr’ said, 
“A sack of money. What should I do with a sack of blessings?”’ 
He gave him a sack of money. He mounted his horse; he rode, 
rode, rode, until he reached the house of Old Lady. The old 
woman said to him, “Good-day, my grandson! Where are you 
going, and what do you want?”—“I am going to look for a 
remedy for my father, who is sick.” The old woman said, 
“Come in! I will set you to eat with my daughter. Who eats 
the less I will kill.” They ate, ate, ate. The daughter went to 
look for more food. In came the second daughter. They ate, 
ate, ate; she went to look for more food. In came the third 
daughter. They ate, ate, ate, Pedr’ got tired. Old Lady said

to him, “Come! I will show you my house with seven keys.” 
They went, Old Lady opened six doors; at the seventh she said, 
“This you will open.” He opened it; Old Lady pushed him into 
the pit, like his brother. 
Mané José said, “My father, I’m going to the end of the world 
to find you a cure.” The father said to him, “Your two elder 
brothers went, they have not returned. If you go, you won’t 
return.”—“‘No, my father! I am going, and I am coming 
back.” The father asked him, “Which do you want,— a sack of 
money, or a sack of blessings?”—‘‘Give me a sack of blessings. 
What should I do with a sack of money?” He gave him a sack of 
blessings. 
Mané José had three dogs, called Flower, Hour, Moment. He 
said to his father, ‘When you see the dogs pulling on this warp- 
line, let them loose, because I shall be in danger.” Mané José 
got on his horse; he went, went, went; he came to the house of 
Old Lady. The old woman said to him, “(My grandson, where — 
are you going?” He answered, “Lady, I’m going to the end of 
the world ma’s balente.”' The old woman gave him a handful of 
salt. She said, “In great danger it will be of service to you.” 
He went, went, went; he met another old woman. The old 
woman said to him, ““O my grandson! where are you going?” He 
answered, “I’m going to the end of the world ma’s balente.” She 
gave him a handful of brier-seed. She said, “In great danger it 
will help you.” He went, went, went; he met another old woman. 
The old woman said, ““O my grandson! where are you going?” 
He answered, ‘I’m going to the end of the world ma’s balente.” 
The old woman gave him three polon-seeds. She said to him, “In 
great danger they will help you.” Then he went, went, went; 
he reached the house of the other old woman. The old woman 
said to him, “I have a daughter, I am going to have you eat 
together. If you eat more, I will kill her; if she eats more than 
you, I will kill you.” They-ate, ate, ate; the girl started to rise 
to go look for more food. He said to her, “No, sit down! When 
we eat up all this which is before us, we’ll go get more, not before.” 
The girl could not eat any more. The old woman said, “My 
grandson, come! J will show you my house with seven keys.” 
The old woman opened six doors. When they came to the 
seventh, she said, “‘Open that door, because my hand is tired.”— 
1 The Balente are an African tribe, I was told; and it was suggested that the phrase meant “beyond the Balente,” but I incline to think it means only “very valiantly [oalente].””

“You open that door yourself; it was you who put on that lock.”” 
The old woman opened the door, he shoved herin. He said to her, 
“Old Lady, you will stay there until you take out my two broth- 
ers.” She took them out. All three took their horses, they went, 
they left Old Lady stuck there. 
Within three days she came out, she mounted her buck,! she 
started after them. She sang,— 
“ Borbodec cidec’} Sir Compa’ Anton, 
Run, I will give you fresh blood to drink.” 
When they looked back, they saw Old Lady behind them. Mané 
José threw down a handful of salt behind them, it turned into a 
sea. Old Lady swam, swam, swam. When she reached the 
other shore, they were gone. The old woman ran, ran, ran. 
She sang,— . 
“ Borbodec cidec’, Sir Compa’ Anton, 
Run, to-day I’ll give you fresh blood to drink.” 
When she overtook them, Mané José threw down behind them a 
handful of brier-seeds, up sprang a brier-thicket. Old Lady fell 
into the briers, she scratched through it all. She went, went, wen t, 
until she was about to catch them again. Mané José threw down 
three polon-seeds; they turned into three po/ons, one for each of 
them. Old Lady came up, she took out aside of her crica;? she made 
a machad’;* she started cutting at the polon. Mané José sang,— 
“Flower, Hour, Moment! 
If you do not help me at this time, 
My water you shall not drink, 
My meat you shall not eat, 
. My meat you shall not eat.”’* 
Directly they saw far off a cloud of dust. Mané José said, “Old

442 ESCAPE UP THE TREE: THE SINGING GOURD. 
There was a man had three sons,— Paul’, Pedr’, José. Paul’ 
told his father he wanted to go to war in the mountains to set an 
example to Jon d’Annis. His father asked him, “Why? There 
is no need for you to go.” —“Let me go! A ship at anchor gets 
no freight.” His father asked him, ‘‘ What do you want,— bless- 
ings from your father and mother, godfather and godmother, or a 
sack of money?” —“‘A sack of money.” His father told him to go 
to the barn to get a horse. “The horse you see heading south 
do not take, take the one you see heading north.” This was 
a curse. He went and took the horse heading south. With his 
sack of money and his little lion he started out. After he went a 
little way, he dismounted to eat. When he ate meat, he would 
throw the bones to his lion; when he ate manioc, he would throw 
him the vine; when he ate potatoes, he would throw him the 
peelings. He went to a fig-tree by the side of a stream. He 
climbed the fig-tree, he ate the ripe figs, he threw him [the lion] 
the green figs. A sow came by. She ate the figs, she rooted at 
the lion. The boy said to her, ‘‘Eat the figs, but leave my lion 
alone.” The boy went on to a little hill, where he met an old man 
riding a she-ass. He said to the old man, “Get out of my way, 
let me pass!” The old man said to him, “Pass, and go your way! 
The road you take you will find full of prickles and carapisa.” 
He went, he came to a settlement, to the house of an old witch. 
The old woman was the sow that had rooted at the lion. “Old 
woman, haven’t you seen a pig with a sour tail pass by?” The 
old woman answered, “Since it passed by here I have prayed 
three rosaries to the end.”—“Can’t you take me in for the 
night?”—“T will take you in with all my heart. What is this 
house of stone and clay, that it should not shelter you! Stay 
here to-night, to-morrow I will tell you all about it.” The old 
woman had a servant called Lena. The old woman said, “Lena, 
go to the chicken-coop, take the chicken facing north, leave the

one facing south. Cook the chicken well, but season it badly.’ 
She asked the boy, “In your father’s house what kind of a table 
are you accustomed to eat off of,—a gold table, or a silver?”’ 
He did not answer. She thought he was uncivilized. The old 
woman told Lena to serve him on a silver table. As he ate, he 
threw the bones to his lion under the table. At bed-time the old 
woman told Lena to make up his bed with the silk spread at the 
bottom, the mattress on top, and on top of the mattress to put 
some thorns. The old woman said to Paul’, “Since laccommodate 
you with all my heart, you must embrace me at my bedside before 
you lie down.! Tie fast your lion.”—“‘T have no rope to tie him 
with.” The old woman gave him an end of hair to tie up the lion. 
When he went to embrace her, the old woman began to wrestle 
with him. He sang for his lion. The lion said to him, “When 
you ate meat, you threw me the bones; when you ate manioc, 
you threw me the vine; when you ate figs, you threw me the green 
figs.” Then the old woman threw Paul’ into the mouth of the 
pit that was at her bedside. 
Pedr’ said to his father, ‘Paul’ went out to set an example to 
Jon d’Annis. Now I must go.” He went. The same things 
happened to him as happened to Paul’. 
José said, “I too, I must go. With your blessing, I have all 
J need. Money I do not need.” — “Go to the barn, leave the 
horse heading north, take the horse heading south.” He took 
the horse heading south. He went to his godmother for her bless- 
ing. She gave him her blessing and the seed of a gourd. He 
went to his godfather for his blessing. He gave him his blessing 
and a tube of salt. His father gave him his blessing and three 
polon-seeds. His mother gave him her blessing and a tube of 
ashes. He told his youngest sister, “I will leave my three lions 
at home. Every day water my garden and attend to my lions, 
Hour, Wait, Moment. When you see my garden dry and my 
lions foaming at the mouth, let them loose.” He came to the 
same place his two brothers stopped at to eat. He sucked the 
bones, he gave the meat to his lion.2 He ate the vine, he gave 
the manioc to his lion. At the fig-tree he ate the green figs, 
he gave the ripe ones to his lion. When the sow came, he said 
to her, “Eat the figs, but leave my lion alone.” When he met

the old woman on the she-ass, he said to her, “‘Dismount and ride 
on my horse, and let me ride on your she-ass!” The old woman 
said, “No. Yesterday and the day before I passed by two boys 
riding horseback. His horse gave my she-ass three kicks. Goon 
your way! You will find a road of salvation. The Virgin Mary 
go with you!” José came to the house of the old woman. He 
asked the old woman if she had seen a pig pass by. “‘Since it 
passed by here I have prayed three rosaries to the end.”—‘‘Can 
you not give me shelter here for the night?”—“TI will give you 
shelter with all my heart. What is this little house of stone and 
clay, that it should not shelter you! Stay here to-night, to- 
morrow I will tell you all about the pig.” When the old woman 
told Lena to cook the chicken well, but to season it badly, José 
said to her, “No, the chicken must be cooked well and seasoned 
well.” The old woman said, ‘Lena, be careful! because he is not 
like the others.” Lena was frightened. She cooked the chicken 
well, she seasoned it well. “In your father’s house what kind of a 
table are you accustomed to eat off of,—a gold, or a silver?”"— 
“Neither, I am accustomed to eat off of a wooden table. My 
father and mother are not rich.”—“In your father’s house what 
kind of plates do you eat from,— gold, or silver?” —‘ Neither, 
T eat off of Port! plates. My father and my mother are not rich.” 
The old woman set the table as José wanted it. As he ate, one 
mouthful he put into his own mouth, the next he gave his lion. 
' “Lena, make up the bed with the silk spread at the bottom, the 
mattress on top, and on top the thorns.” José said to her, “No, 
the bed must be made with the thorns at the bottom, the mattress 
on top, and on top of it the silk spread.” When the old woman 
asked him to embrace her, he said, “In my father’s house are many 
servants, I never play with them, and you are older than my 
grandmother!” The old woman said to him, “You have nothing 
to do with that.”—‘‘No, Old Lady, not to-night; to-morrow, on 
my return, I will embrace you, and I will give you a kiss.” When 
it was morning, she asked him again to embrace her and to give 
her a kiss. He refused. The old woman had two daughters 
and one son,—Zabél, Maria, Julian. After he left, the old 
woman told her children to get their weapons ready to go with her 
to kill him. José grew tired, he saw that they were overtaking 
him, he threw the tube of salt behind him. It became a sea. 
The old woman cut a road through the sea with her picaref and

machad’. Then she carried home the tools. She started out after 
him again. He walked, walked, walked, until he grew tired again. 
He looked back, he saw them overtaking him. He threw down 
the tube of ashes, it became a snow-storm. They returned home 
to get the tools to cut through the cloud. They cut through, 
they carried the tools home, they started out after him again. 
He grew tired, he looked back, he saw that they were overtaking 
him. He threw down a polon-seed. He sang,— 
“Up, up, polon, 
Up, up, as high as can be! 
This woman is to kill me to-day.” 
The polon grew, grew, grew, until it became the highest polon 
in the world, and eight men could not encircle it. The old woman 
returned home to get her tools. She cut, cut, cut. The children 
grew tired. She sang,— 
“Tundun Zabél, 
Tundun Maria, 
Tundun Julian, 
Virgin Mary, our mother, 
Because the man we are to kill him to-day!” 
They cut, cut, cut, until the polo lacked but a thread of falling. 
José threw another po/on-seed. He sang,— 
“Polon, up, up, 
Polon, up, up, 
Up, up, as high as you can! 
For this woman is to kill me to-day.” 
The po/on grew high. The old woman went home to get her tools 
to cut it down. She sang,— 
“Tundun Maria, 
Tundun Zabél, 
Tundun Julian, 
Virgin Mary, our mother, 
See this man I am going to kill to-day! 
Double cut, my little machad’, 
Serve me as adze, my machad’, 
Because this gentleman I am to kill to-day.” 
They cut, cut, cut, until the po/on lacked but a thread of falling. 
José threw the third polon-seed. He sang,—
-P-A-G-E-156
Folk-Lore from the Cape Verde Islands. 129 
“Up, up, polon, 
Up, up, high as you can! 
For this. woman is to kill me to-day.” 
The third polon grew up taller and thicker than the others. 
They cut, cut, cut. As the tree was about to fall, José called to 
his sister at home, ““You remember what I told you at the door 
of our house when I left?”” At this very time his sister went into 
the garden. She found it drying up; the lions were foaming at 
the mouth. She turned back to the house; she said, “Mamma, 
mamma, do you remember what José said as he went out of the 
door?” She ran for a knife to cut the rope of the lions. The rope 
was all twisted from the jumps of the lions. The polon was 
almost falling- when José saw something that looked like three 
little dogs about five miles away. He asked Old Lady, “Do you 
not see something coming there?” —“That is a goatherd who is 
herding.” Now the lions ran up. They got there. José called,— 
“Hour! Moment! Wait! 
Take care, take care, O my little lions! 
If you are to help me, help me to-day, 
Because to-day is the first and the last, 
The last day of my life.”” — 
“Hour, you see that woman? I don’t want to see a particle of her 
left.— Moment, Wait, you see those girls and that boy? I don’t 
want to see a particle of them left.” The lions took the old 
woman, the girls, and the boy, they did not leave a particle of 
them; all of them became farina. José returned to the house of 
the old woman. He said to Lena, “Lena, unless you give me the 
key of the pit, the road Old Lady has travelled you too will travel.” 
—“José, you must go to my mother, pick her on the right side and 
on the left, and the key will come out.” José picked, the key 
came out. He took it, he opened the door. At the first door he 
found his two brothers. He ordered Lena to make asoup. Lena, 
afraid José would kill her, made the soup as quickly as she could. 
The place where his brothers were is like from Newport to Fall 
River. In the middle of it he found people so weak, that they 
could not take the soup even through a tube. Then he took out 
all the people who were there. He told Lena to take care of the 
place like her mother. 
_He started for home with his brothers. They walked three

days. As they neared home, they came toa well. José told Paul’ 
to drink first. ‘‘No, my brother Pedr’ must drink first.” Pedr’ 
said, “No, my brother José must drink first.” When José leaned 
down to drink, Paul’ struck him with a cutlass. He fell dead into 
the well. After they reached home, their father asked if they had 
not met their brother José. They said, “No.” The next day a 
servant went to the well. She saw a gourd-vine with a gourd on 
it. She began to beat on the gourd. It began to sing,— 
“Ta, ta, servant of my father, 
Do not play on that little gourd 
Which strikes on the cord of my heart. 
My first brother as matador, 
My middle brother, councillor. 
Ai! Ai! Donat! Ai! Ai! Doblinciano! 
Ta, ta, servant of my father, 
Donat, Doblinciano!” 
The servant went to the house. She told his father how she went 
to the well and played on the gourd, and how the gourd told her 
not to play on it. The man scolded the girl for playing and not 
bringing water. He did not believe the little girl about the gourd. 
The little girl returned to the well, he followed her. He told her 
to play on the gourd. The gourd sang,—~ 
“Ta, ta, servant of my father, 
Do not play on that little gourd,” etc. 
The man went home, he locked in his two sons. He went to 
José’s godmother. He remembered she had given him the seed 
of a gourd. The godmother went with the father to the well. 
She took with her a towel and her rosary, When they arrived at 
the well, they told the servant to play on the gourd. The gourd 
sang,— 
“Ta, ta, servant of my father, 
Do not play on that little gourd,” etc. 
The godmother herself played on the gourd. 
“Ta ta ta ta, O Lady Godmother! 
Do not play on that little gourd,” etc. 
She put her rosary around the gourd and wrapped it in the towel. 
José’s father had a drum. He played it in the citadel to call 
together the people to hear a little gourd talk like people. All

came to hear it,— the doctor, the priest, the bishop, the ad- 
ministrator of the council. The doctor was to open the gourd. 
As he put a knife to it, it sang,— 
“Ta ta ta ta, O Sir Doctor! 
Do not play on that little gourd,” etc. 
He put his knife to the other side of the gourd. The gourd said, 
“Go slow! here is the cord of my heart.” As the gourd was 
opened, out came José as a man. He embraced his mother and 
his godmother. All the people believed he was Don José. He 
told them all that had happened between his brothers and himself. 
His father asked him what he wished done to his brothers. “I 
was true to them, they were false to me. Send for four horses,— 
from east, west, north, south. Tie my brothers. Then beat the 
drum, each [horse] will think of his world quarter, and cut them 
in four pieces.” José’s father married him to the servant. They 
lived a new life, a life new. 
45. ESCAPE UP THE TREEL 
There was a man married to a woman. She was a witch. He 
had a dog that guarded him all the time. She wanted to kill him, 
but because of the charm (guarda or religue) he had she could not 
kill him? She said to him, “Since our marriage we have been 
nowhere. I have a garden (4érf) I want to show you.” They 
arose at dawn. He started to get his dog. She said to him, 
“No, the man who walks with a dog, with him I do not walk.” 
He started to get his stick. She said to him, “No, the man who 
walks with a stick, with him I do not walk.” He took three 
polon-seeds and hid them on his person. They started. After 
they went a little way, she said, “If you called your dog here, could 
he hear you?” —“Yes.” They went on a little way. She said 
to him, “If you called your dog here, could he hear you?” —“ Yes.” 
They went on a little way. She said to him, “If you called your 
dog here, could he hear you?” He was suspicious. He said,

annual three-day trip and calls his dogs, Caléjon, Seléjon, Hetéjon, the servant sees the 
dogs jumping and straining, and says to her mistress, “Lady, the master is in trouble.”— 
“None of your business,” says the mistress. ‘Let them jump!” She takes off her slipper 
and slaps the girl on the mouth.... On his return home, when he hears of this, he tells 
the girl to slap her mistress on the mouth with her slipper. Then he boils his wife to 
death, and sends the corpse to where they make clay to be made into a stone for the door, 
to step on as he goes in and out, (San Nicolao.) Compare Tremearne, 298.

“No.” ! She said to him, “Say all the prayers you know. This 
is the last day of your life.” He said, “Let me go to the top of 
that little hill!” He went, and he sang,— 
“Little lion! Little lion!” 
She said, “‘Sing, sing all you want, because to-day is your last 
day.” The first time he sang, his dog heard him and jumped, 
but did not get free. He sang again; this time the dog jumped 
and broke his chain. The woman said, ‘Get ready! this is the 
last day of your life.” He sang the third time. The little dog 
was running after him. The woman said, “Come on! this is the 
time.” He remembered the po/on-seeds in his pocket. He 
dropped one. Apo/onsprangup. Heclimbeduponit. She took 
out a tooth, and out of it made a machad’. She said, “Cup, cup, 
my little machad’!” The tree was almost down; he threw down 
another seed. He climbed up on it. Far away he saw a little 
smoke. He took hope. She said, “Cup, cup, my little machad’!’’ 
The tree was almost down, then he threw down another polon- 
seed. She kept cutting. The tree was almost down when the 
little dog rushed against her. She said, “O my husband! this 
is our little dog, the little dog I am used to playing with.” The 
man said to the dog, ‘Seize her, and don’t let a drop of her 
blood fall to the ground!” * When the dog seized her, she cried, 
“He has hold of me in a bad place!” The dog ate her up! 
46.4 ESCAPE UP THE TREE: WITHOUT FEAR. 
There was a woman and man had one son. One day he [the 
son] went down to the beach, he found four little lions. He took 
them home. As they had the itch, his mother would not let them 
in. So he left them with his godmother. When he was twenty- 
one years of age, he asked his father and mother for their blessing. 
“T’m going out into the world to see things to talk about.” He 
took with him his lions, Jira, Marian’, Salamansa, Sojiroconjiro.

ment), would they answer. ... She goes to the brook and gets three dragons (icha fe’ra) 
to cut down the trees. (Cab’ Verde.)

He came to the house of a king who had three daughters. He 
went inside, he told the girls he was going to tie the lions to the 
leg of the table. “If one of you unties them, I’ll cut off her head 
with this sharp sword of mine.” He went, went, went, until he 
came to a cliff where there were a lot of monkeys. The monkeys 
sang,— 
“Grititi bata tebata, 
Ant, dried up thing!” 
The boy was afraid of the monkeys, and he called for his lions,— 
“Jira, Mariano, Salamansa, Sojiroconjiro!”” 
The lions began to jump and pull at their rope. The youngest 
sister wanted to let them go. The eldest sister said to her, 
“Don’t let them go, because the man will kill you.” The monkeys 
sang again,— 
“Grititi, bata, tebata, 
Ant, dried up thing!” 
The boy sang,— 
“Jira, Mariano, Salamansa, Sojiroconjiro!” 
The lions began to spring about violently; the youngest sister 
decided to loose them and let them go. They started to come; 
the boy, who was crying from despair, saw them far off, a cloud of 
dust. When they arrived, he cut his bread into four pieces, he ’ 
gave them each a piece. He said to them, “Help me, my lions! 
Those monkeys want to kill me.” The lions sprang on the mon- 
keys; they killed, killed, killed, until only one monkey was left, 
the king of those mountains. This monkey was hiding away in 
a hole, only at night he came out to spy around. The boy saw 
him, he sent the lions after him. They caught him, they tore 
him to pieces. 
Then the boy, well satisfied, went back with his lions to the 
king’s house. He asked, “Which of you loosed the lions?” 
The youngest sister was afraid, she did not answer. He asked 
again, ‘‘Which of you loosed the lions?” The youngest sister 
answered, “It was I loosed them. They were jumping on the 
rope, I loosed them to let them go.” —‘‘Good! you for my wife.” 
The eldest sister answered, “No, sir! it’s a lie, it was I loosed 
them.” The second sister said, ‘No, sit! it was I loosed: them.”

The boy said, ‘Whichever one of you is able to scare me, I will 
marry.” The youngest sister took a sparrow, and put it under the 
wash-bowl the boy washed in. The next day in the morning, 
when he turned the bowl to wash his face, out flew the sparrow. 
The boy was scared} The youngest sister came up and embraced 
him. They were married, and they lived a long life. 
47. WITHOUT FEAR.” 
There were a poor man and his wife livingin the country. They 
had three sons and a daughter. The eldest boy was half-witted. 
When they went to the city, they had to pass by a cemetery. 
None of the children would go into the cemetery but the half-wit, 
who would go into this cemetery. As they would not go, he said, 
“T wish to know what fear is.” One day he left the house, he 
passed by a man in a yard who heard him say that he had a 
wish to know what fear was. The man said to him, “You said 
that you had a wish to know what fear was?” The boy said, 
“Yes.”” The man took him to a gallows. He said to him, “ You 
stay here until I see you in the morning. When you hear the bell? 
make a light.” The boy made a light, he built a fire. He looked 
up, he saw men hanging on the gallows. He said, “You poor 
fellows hanging there on the gallows while I sit here by the fire!” 
He climbed up, he brought the men down, he placed them by the 
fire. He said, “I’m tired making this fire. When it burns up 
close to you, do you push it back.” He went on moving the 
sticks three or four times; then, [as] the men did not stir the fire, 
he put them back in their place on the gallows, where they were 
on the gallows. Then he lay down, he slept until morning. The 
man came, he saw that he could do nothing with him, he let him 
alone. 
He went on his way, he met a woman. He said to her, “I wish 
I knew what fear is!” The woman took him to the king’s house, 
where he said again, ‘‘I wish I knew what fear is!”” The king said 
to him, “If you sleep in a certain house [it was a house which had 
a treasure the king knew about],—if you sleep there for three 
nights without fear, I will give you half of my wealth, and I will

marry you to my daughter.” The king took him to a house, 
locked him in, left him. He made a fire, he sat down to warm 
himself. He saw nobody, he went to sleep. At midnight he 
awoke, he found a man sitting by him. The man said to him, 
“Get out of here!” —‘I, I’m not going to get out from here. I 
was ordered to stay here until morning.” In the morning the 
king sent a troop to see what he was doing. He went for dinner 
to the king’s house, then he returned to the house for the night. 
He built a fire, he was almost asleep when he heard a noise. There, 
falling down in front of him, he saw half a man. He said, “There 
are bad men up there cutting up people in halves.” He placed 
the half of the man by the fire. In a little while another half fell 
down He placed it by the first half. He said, “When the fire 
burns up close to you, push it back.” The fire burned up, but 
he had to push it back himself. He said to the halves, “If you 
don’t push back the fire, Pll throw you out of the window.” The 
two halves joined together and made a little figure. The little 
man took the boy’s seat. The boy said to him, “Move away 
from here!” The figure did not answer him. “If you don’t 
answer me, I’ll cut off your head.” Still the figure did not 
answer. He started to get a machad’. Then the little figure dis- 
appeared. In the morning the king sent his troop, and he gave a 
big feast because he thought the treasure would soon be recovered. 
No one before had slept two nights in that house. The third 
night a phantom appeared; he asked the boy, “What kind of a 
game can you play?” The phantom took three balls. He said, 
“Tf you want one, I keep two. If you want two, Ill give you two, 
T’ll keep one.” They began to play. The boy asked, “What 
kind of a game is this?” He answered, “Three for one.” They 
played, the boy won. Then the phantom disappeared. When 
it was near morning, there appeared a monster. The monster 
said to him, “Get out of here!”—‘‘No, wherever you go, I shall 
go too. If you stay, I stay.” The monster said, “Then follow 
me!” The monster showed him the treasure, and then he dis- 
appeared. In the morning the troop arrived. At first they did 
not find him. He heard them call him; but the treasure was so 
bright, it had blinded him, and he could not get out. When they 
found him, they took him to the king’s house. 
He married the king’s daughter. But still he said, “I wish I

knew what fear is!” His wife took him into the country to teach 
him what fear is. The woman bought an a/gueire of small fish 
from a fisherman, she gave them to the servant; she said to her, 
“When we are in bed, drop the fish over my husband.”” When he 
slept, the servant dropped the fish over him. The fish began to 
dance over him. He gave a leap, he jumped out of bed. His 
wife said to him, “I thought you said you never were afraid.” 
He answered, “‘If this is fear, 1 have been afraid for years.” 
48. THE FIG-TREE! 
A king had a Portuguese fig-tree. He put a servant to guard 
it against the birds. When the king came, he found a fig missing. 
He said to the girl, “A fig is missing. You took it.” The girl 
said to him, “No, I did not take it. It was a bird that took it. 
It dropped it on the ground, I picked it up, I ate it.” The king 
killed her, he buried her in that place. On her grave green grass 
sprouted. The king sent a little Moor to pull grass. As soon as 
he began to pull grass, she sang,— 
“Little Negro Moor of my father, 
Don’t pull my hair! 
My step-mother put me here 
On account of one Portuguese fig. 
A bird flew by, the fig fell, the fig fell, 
I took it, I ate it.” 
He began to pull again. Again she sang,— 
“Little Negro Moor of my father, 
Don’t pull my hair! 
My step-mother put me here 
On account of one Portuguese fig. 
A bird flew by, the fig fell, the fig fell, 
I took it, I ate it.” 
He ran home, he told the king something spoke tohim. The king 
said to him, “If it is true, I will set you free; if it is not true, I 
will kill you.” The king went with him to the fig-tree. He 
began to pull the grass. She sang,—

My step-mother put me here 
On account of one Portuguese fig. 
A bird flew by, the fig fell, the fig fell,

The king told the servant to dig up the grave. He was conscience- 
stricken, he gave her something. 
49. THE ESCAPE. 
There was a woman had a daughter she was very fond of. The 
little girl had a little horse with a broken leg. Her mother always 
said to her, “Don’t ride on this horse with a broken leg, because 
he will carry you off to the land of the savages.” One day, when 
the little girl was fifteen years old, she mounted the horse. He 
ran, ran, ran, until he reached the land of the savages. The 
horse ran so hard, she paid no attention to where he went. The 
savages put her in prison to eat her. One day there she felt very 
sad. She sang,— 
“Tt was well my mother said to me 
Not to go to a distant land, 
Because the distant land has savage people, 
They eat people.” ? 
The savages heard, they were pleased. They said to her, “Sing 
again!” She said to them, “I'll sing again if you take me out.” 
They took her out, she sang,— 
“Tt was well my mother said to me 
Not to get on my little horse for a distance, 
Because the distant land has savage people, 
They eat people.” : 
“Sing again!”—“T’ll sing again if you let me go on my little 
horse up to that hill.” They let her go, She sang, she came back.

“Sing again!”’—“If you let me go still a little farther.” They 
let her go. She sang, she came back. “Sing again!”—‘If you 
let me go there to that high cliff.” They said to her, “No, you 
may escape.” She answered, ‘““No, I won’t run away. I am 
used to you all now. I don’t think of my own people.” They let 
her go up to the cliff. Then she and her horse ran, ran, ran. 
They came to the river between the land of the savages and the 
land where her mother lived. The savages came after her. They 
threw their spear? at her, but she was too far off for them to 
strike her. The horse jumped into the river, it swam to the 
other side. The savages came up to the river, they saw they 
could not catch her, they returned home. She went home, she 
told her mother what had happened. From this you may see 
that when a mother gives counsel to a child, it should heed. She 
did not ride the horse again. They put it in the stable, where 
they fed it, and did not put it to work because it had saved the 
girl’s life.

There were a wolf and a hen of the woods [guinea-hen]. This 
wolf went hunting. He found a hen. He was glad, he took her 
home. He made a cage, he put her in it until the day came to 
eat her. One day he was sitting at the door of his house putting 
a patch on his trousers. Hen was considering how she could 
escape. She sang,— 
“O Sir Wolf! 
Cow-ribs for a house, 
Clotted milk to whitewash the house, 
Cow-head to prop the door to,? 
Fresh milk to eat in the house. 
O Sir Wolf!” 
When Wolf heard this song, he got up, he danced. He said, 
“Comadre Hen, I did not know you knew how to sing. Sing a 
little more! The song is sweet.” Hen said to him, “The song 
will be even sweeter if you open the door of the cage for me.” 
Wolf ran, he opened the door. She sang,—

Wolf was so pleased with her, he let her go out to the little hill. 
She flew, she went her way. Wolf ran after her; he called to her, 
“O Comadre, sing! O Comadre, sing!” He was angry that she 
had fooled him, angry that he had to go after her again.

There was a woman who had an only daughter. When she lay 
dying, she said to her daughter, “Whatever any one says to you, 
say no.” At this time in England there were many war-ships. 
The captains of the ships heard of this girl, They went to see 
her. They said to her, “How do you do?” She answered, “No.” 
They said to her, “‘Give us a drink of water.” She answered, 
“No.” They went to their ships. They said to one another, 
“What is the matter with the girl, that whatever we say to her she 
says no?” An old sailor overheard their talk. He said to 
another sailor, “If I went to this girl to ask for a drink, she would 
give it to me.” The man told the captain what the old sailor 
had said. The captain called the old sailor to the pilot-house. 
“Ts it true you said that you could go to the girl’s house and have 
her give you a drink of water?”—“ Yes, I said it. But I don’t 
go there for nothing. I’ll go there for four dollars and a bottle

laid a bet on the old sailor. 
The old sailor went to the girl’s house. He said to her, “Good- 
day!” The girl said to him, “No.”—‘Can’t I have a drink of 
water?”’—“‘No,”"—“ What if I drank a cup of water, it wouldn’t 
do any harm, would it?”—‘‘No.”—‘ You don’t invite me in, do 
you?” —“No,”-—“ What if I came in, it wouldn’t do any harm, 
would it?”—“No.” The captains were watching at a distance.

They saw him enter the house. ‘“‘See that old fellow with his old 
cap,— the lousy thing, it must be fifteen years old! He is doing 
something we couldn’t do.” 
The old sailor staid in the girl’s house until supper-time. He 
said, ‘You don’t invite me to supper, do you?”’-—“‘No.”—“ What 
if I drank a cup of tea with you, it wouldn’t do any harm, would 
it?’—“‘No.” She prepared to go to bed. “‘ You don’t invite me 
to go to bed with you, do you?”—“ No.” —“ What if I went to bed 
with you, it wouldn’t do any harm, would it?”’—“‘No.”-—“‘ What 
if I embraced you, it wouldn’t do any harm, would it?”-~‘‘No.” 
He played with her. He said to her, “If I put it into you, it 
wouldn’t do any harm, would it?”—‘‘No.” Then he put into 
her all he had. He went on board, he won the bet. 
$1. FISH-LOVER.! 
There was a girl who planned to marry a fish. His name was 
Seni2 This girl had a proud sister. The two sisters went out 
to gather wood. Maria left Antonia to go to talk toSeni. She 
sang,— 
“O Seni! O Senon! 
Below the belly,? Seni. 
O Seni! O Seni! 
Below the belly, O Seni!” 
When she sang, [the fish] became a youth. He gathered the wood 
for her, he combed her hair. They sat down and talked. She 
reached home late, after Antonia. She told them she had been 
lost. Her mother asked, ‘Why didn’t you keep with your sister?” 
She answered, “I left her because I knew where there was good 
wood.” When the two girls were alone, they started to quarrel. 
Antonia knew Maria was in love with a fish, she said she would 
tell their mother. Maria promised her a fine dress not to tell. 
One day when Maria went to church, Antonia told their father 
that Maria was in love with a fish. He told Antonia to bring a 
machad’ and a dish. “Show me where the fish comes up. We 
will kill him, we will bring him to Maria.” When they reached 
the place, Antonia sang,—

occurred in this tale. Seni is “little Sena;” Senon, “big Sena.”

“O Seni! O Senon! 
Below the belly, Seni. 
OSeni! O Seni! 
Below the belly, O Seni!” 
When the fish put up his head, the man struck him with the 
machad’ , he killed him, he put him in the dish, he carried him home. 
They cooked the fish, they ate, they saved some for Maria. The 
first piece she put in her mouth sprang out and fell to the ground. 
She suspected that it was Seni they had killed. She took off her 
pretty dress, she put on the dress she wore to gather wood. Her 
mother said to her, “No, don’t go for wood! This is a church day, 
no one goes to gather wood.”” Maria said, “I am going for wood. 
The weather is good. Later on in winter we can’t gather wood.” 
Her mother let her go. She knew Maria was going after Seni. 
When Maria reached the place, she sang,— 
“O Seni! O Senon! 
Below the belly, Seni. 
O Seni! O Seni! 
Below the belly, O Seni!” 
Seni did not appear, but she saw a drop of blood. She sang 
again,— 
“O Seni! O Senon! 
Below the belly, Seni. 
O Seni! O Seni! 
Below the belly, O Seni!” 
A bone appeared. She wept and wept, until the bones combined 
and formed a fish. She sang,— 
“O Seni! O Senon! 
Below the belly, Seni. 
O Seni! O Seni! 
Below the belly, O Seni!” 
The fish turned into a youth. He said, “‘Maria, your father and 
your sister killed me. What do you want me to do to them?”— 
“Make me a steamship, the best afloat, and load it with fruit. 
Let us sail on it to a port where my father and my sister will 
come on board to buy fruit. We will put them in irons, we will 
leave with them for another country, we will sell them for Negroes. 
That will be a disgrace for them.” She had not the heart to kill 
them.

$2, WHITE-FLOWER.! 
There was a rich man had one son called Manuel.2 The boy 
started to gamble. He gambled until his father knew that he 
was gambling. He gave him seven conte de reis. He said to him, 
“This is the last money I am going to give you, it is your inheri- 
tance.” There was a witch called Jon di Monte Verde. He 
heard of the boy’s money, he went in search of him. They sat 
down to gamble together. They played, played, played. The 
boy won all the money the witch had. The witch said to Manuel, 
“T am going to play my daughter, the prettiest damsel there is 
in the world.”” The boy won her from the witch. The witch 
disappeared without giving him the damsel. 
He told the boy that he lived at Monte Verde, whither nothing 
went but birds. Manuel went to look for him. He went to the 
house of Mother-of-Cows. Mother-of-Cows said to him, ‘‘Where 
are you going, my grandson?”——“I am going to Monte Verde. 
Old Lady, can’t you tell me where Monte Verde is?” Old Lady 
answered, “No, but I have many children who go all over the 
world. At night they will come home, they can tell you.” At 
night they said, “Lady mother, I smell royal blood here.” When 
they were about to find him, the old woman gave Manuel a cuff. 
He turned into a stool. She sat down on it. After they ate, 
they lay down. The old woman gave the stool a cuff, it turned 
into Manuel. He asked them if they could not tell him where 
Monte Verde was. “No, we’ve been all over the world, but we 
have not heard the name.” The old woman said to him, “Go to 
Mother-of-Birds.” He went to the house of Mother-of-Birds. 
“Good-day, Old Lady!”-—‘Good-day, my grandson!”—“Can’t 
you tell me where Monte Verde is?”—‘‘Wait until my children 
come home.” When they were about to arrive, the old woman 
gave him a cuff. He turned into a tablecloth, he began to clean

the dishes. When they arrived, they said, ‘Lady mother, I smell 
royal blood here.” After they ate, they lay down. Their 
mother said to them, “Manuel is here. He wants to know where 
Monte Verde is. I told him to wait, you could tell him.”—“We 
don’t know; but let him wait for our brother, King-of-the-Birds; 
he goes farther than we, he can tell him.” King-of-the-Birds 
came. He said to him, “I have just come by there, but you won’t 
be able to go there.”—~“‘Isn’t there any one who could take me 
there?” —“T could take you there, but you must give me some- 
thing to eat on the way.”——‘‘What do you want?”—“I want an 
ox and a barrel of blood.” Manuel bought an ox and a barrel of 
blood from Mother-of-Cows. The bird took the ox; he put it 
over one wing, the barrel of blood over the other. He said, 
“Manuel, get on my back.” They started; they flew, flew, flew. 
When they were half way, the bird swallowed the ox and the barrel 
of blood. They flew, flew, flew. Three-quarters way along the 
bird said to him, “See that mountain there, there is Monte Verde, 
but we can’t go farther because I am hungry.’”’ Manuel said to 
him, “Take a piece from my leg, eat it; take blood from my 
veins, drink it.” The bird took his leg off, he swallowed it; he 
took blood from his veins, he drank. He flew, flew, flew. He 
put Manuel on the ground at a brook. He said, “Manuel, get 
up!” Manuel said to him, “How can I stand withouta leg?” He 
raised Manuel up with his beak. When Manuel looked down, he 
saw his leg whole. 
The bird said to him, “Go a little way until you come to a lake 
where you will find three ducks,—one white, two black. Each 
of them will drop a feather. Take the white feather.” Manuel 
went, he found the ducks. They dropped the feathers. He took 
the white feather. The white duck said to him, “Give me my 
feather.” Manuel said to her, “I will give you your feather, but 
first you show me your father’s house.” The duck showed him 
the house, he gave her her feather.1 
The witch was not pleased when he saw Manuel, for he knew 
that Manuel was a witch like himself. He said, “Manuel, I 
know that you have come to collect your debt. Do you see that

rock there? Here is a grape-vine, plant it there, gather grapes, 
make wine, bring it to me for my breakfast to-morrow morning.” 
Manuel went, he began to cry. White-Flower came to talk to 
him, she found him crying; she asked, “What is the matter with 
you that you are crying?”—‘‘It is your father who gives me a 
grape-vine to plant to get grapes from to make wine to take to 
him to-morrow morning for breakfast. It will take a year for it to 
begin to give grapes.” White-Flower said to him, “Don’t cry! 
That is nothing. Take this little box; when you get to the rock, 
open it.” He opened it; he saw some planting the vine, others 
picking grapes, others making wine, others bringing the wine in. 
His wife, who knew more than he, said to him, “Husband, I 
think this is our daughter’s work.” —“No, don’t worry, ’'m going 
to catch this rascal.” 
He said, “Manuel, to marry my daughter, you must climb 
that mast. It is four hundred feet high. You must climb it with 
a glass of water without spilling a drop.” Manuel went, be began 
to cry. White-Flower asked him, “Why are you crying?”— 
“Your father said to me that I must climb that mast with a glass 
of water without spilling a drop.” White-Flower said to him, 
“That is nothing. Go and climb it.” He climbed. When he 
reached the top, a drop of water fell. The witch said, “I’m 
going to kill you.”” White-Flower said to her father, “That drop 
is from his eye. He is high up there, he sees his country, which 
makes him weep.” 
The witch said to him, “To-morrow I am going to give you a 
wild horse to tame.” Manuel was well pleased, because he knew 
that he was a good rider. ‘‘Why are you pleased to-day?” asked 
White-Flower. “Because riding is the best thing I do. This is 
the best thing your father has given me to do.” White-Flower 
said to him, “It is the hardest thing which he has given you. 
This is the thing you should cry about. The horsé is my father, 
the saddle is my mother, the stirrups are my two sisters, and the 
reins are myself.” Manuel began to cry. White-Flower said to 
him, “Don’t cry! Tell my father that you learned to ride with 
spurs and a bundle of sticks of marme/’, with a man to hand you 
a stick as soon as one broke. When he begins to throw you, give 
him the spurs and whip, spare only the reins.” Manuel tamed the 
horse, he put him in the stall. The next day in the morning he 
went into the house, he found the old man lying in bed. He 
asked him, “Did I tame the horse well?”—“‘Oh, yes! that was

the way to tame a horse. To-morrow you may marry my 
daughter.! 
“Buti havethreedaughters. They will stay inside a room, they 
will put out their hands through a hole, you must choose one.” 
White-Flower said to Manuel, “The hand with the tip of one finger 
cut off is mine. When you take it, tell him your father taught 
you not to let go a hand, once you held it, until you saw the face 
it belonged to.” The next day Manuel chose the hand with the 
tip of one finger cut off? The witch told him to let it go. “No, 
my father taught me not to let go a hand until I saw the face.” 
Then the witch married him to White-Flower. 
He said, “We are going to settle him yet.” White-Flower said, 
“Manuel, get ready, we are going to run away. Go to the stable, 
you will find three horses. Two are fine and fat, one is so ugly 
and poor it can hardly stand up. Take the poorest you find there, 
then we'll go.” Manuel went to the stable, he took the fine fat 
one. White-Flower said to him, ““O Manuel! you are the death 
of us. Why didn’t you do what I told you? The poor horse . 
was Feeling. Of the other two, one was Sun, the other was Moon. 
You took Sun.” When they went to lie down in the bed made up 
for them, White-Flower put a barrel in the bed and covered it up. 
She spit three times, they left. At midnight her father called, 
““White-Flower!” The first drop of spittle answered, ‘‘ Father.” 
At two o'clock he called again, “‘White-Flower!” The second 
drop of spittle answered, “Father!” He said, ‘‘They are not 
going to sleep to-night, those newly-wed.” At three o'clock he 
called again, “White-Flower!” The third drop of spittle an- 
swered, “Father!” At four o'clock he called again, ‘“ White- 
Flower!” No answer. He had a machine to kill them. He 
worked the machine, he heard the barrel fall down. He said to 
his wife, “Now we’ve got them.” He waited until mid-day to 
go look for the bodies. When he went, he could not find them. 
His wife said to him, “They are gone. Go to the stable. If 
Feeling is still there, we'll catch them yet. If he is not, we have 
Jost them.” He found Feeling, he went after them at once. 
White-Flower looked back; she said, ‘Manuel, our father is after 
us.”-—“What shall we do?” —‘‘Let our horse turn into a church; 
for me, I’ll turn into a saint on the altar, you into a priest. When 
he comes up, he will ask if a man and woman have passed by here. 
You answer him, ‘This is a fine mass we are holding, come in!’

He will ask again, give him the same answer. He will get hungry, 
he will go home.” The father came up; he asked, ‘‘Father, 
have you seen a man and woman pass by here?” The priest 
answered, “‘Sir, this is a fine mass we are holding here; come 
in!” He asked again, “Have you seen a man and woman pass 
by here?”—“‘Sir, this is a fine mass we are holding here; come 
in!” He got hungry, he returned home. He told his wife, “I 
went till I came to a church; I asked the priest if he had seen 
a man and woman pass by there. He said to me, “This is a fine 
mass we are holding here; come in!’ JI asked him again, he an- 
swered the same. I got hungry, I came home.” The woman 
said to him, “O fool! had you gone into the church, you would 
have them now. You must go back after them again.” 
White-Flower looked back; she said, “Manuel, father is after 
us, but this is nothing. Let our horse turn into a garden; as for 
me, I will turn into a flower, you into a flower-seller. Each time 
he asks you if you have seen a man and a woman pass here, say 
to him, ‘The flowers are five reis apiece.’ He will get hungry, he 
will return.” When he came up, he asked the flower-seller, 
“‘Haven’t you seen anybody pass by here?” ‘The man answered, 
“The flowers are five reis apiece.” He asked again, he got the 
same answer. He got hungry, he went home. His wife said to 
him, “O fool! had you bought the flower, you would have them 
here.” The woman jumped up, she slapped him. ‘Now it is 
my time to go.” 
White-Flower knew a little more than her mother. ‘‘Manuel, 
our mother is after us. Let our horse turn into a sea, me into a 
boat, you into a rower.!| When she comes up, she will say, ‘Sir, 
can’t you take me to the other side?’ You answer, ‘No.’ She 
wil] jump into the sea after us. When she asks you for her key, 
throw her this key.” Thus it happened. The old woman 
jumped into the-sea after them. She swam after the boat, she 
could not catch them. She called out, ‘““O White-Flower! throw 
me the key of my trunk.”? He threw the key, hit her in the eye, 
put it out. Her mother began to cry; she said, ‘The curse of 
God on you is that when you arrive where you are going, he will

leave you there, in the hut of a chicken-raiser, he will forget you 
for seven years, seven months, seven weeks, seven days, seven 
hours, seven minutes, seven seconds, and seven divisions of the 
world.” When they arrived, he left her in the hut of a chicken- 
raiser to go to the city to find a house for them to live in. White- 
Flower said, “Manuel, when you go, let nobody put a hand on 
your head.” Manuel reached the king’s house. As he sat there 
talking with the king, the king’s daughter passed by, she put her 
hand on his head.!_ At once he forgot White-Flower, the curse of 
her mother fastened on her. 
When White-Flower had been seven years in the chicken-house, 
two boys passed by, one playing the viola, the other the violin. 
They said, “‘This woman is pretty. To-morrow we’ll come here 
to play.” Next day they went to her hut to play. The whole 
night they tried to play, they could not tune their instruments. 
They got angry, they broke their instruments. They said, 
“To-morrow we'll come back, we will beat her.” The next day, 
when they came with sticks to beat her, they began to beat each 
other. 
At this time Manuel was engaged to marry the king’s daughter. 
For seven years White-Flower had been raising a pig, the biggest 
pig there was in that place. The day of the wedding the king 
sent to buy this pig for the wedding. She said, “I will not sell it, 
but J will give it to him as a present.” It was so big that two 
horses could not carry it. White-Flower took a cock and a hen 
and some corn, she put them in a basket, she went and sat down 
under the verandah of the king, where Manuel and his bride were 
sitting. She threw down a grain of corn. The hen ran to get it, 
the cock ran and passed her. She said to him, “Shoo! greedy 
cock! If you remembered when my father gave you a vine to 
plant and to gather grapes, and to make wine and to bring it to 
him the next day for breakfast, and when I gave you a little box, 
you saw men planting, others gathering grapes, others making 
wine, others taking it in.—if you remembered, you would let 
the hen get that grain of corn.” She threw down another grain 
of corn. The hen ran to get it, the cock passed her. She said 
to him, “Shoo! greedy cock! If you remembered the day my 
father told you to climb a mast with a cup of water without spilling

since you cried from sadness up so high that you saw your coun- 
try, which made you cry,— if you remembered, you would let

to get it, the cock passed her. She said to him, “Shoo! greedy 
cock! If you remembered the day my father gave you a horse to 
tame, which I told you how to tame,— if you remembered, you 
would let the hen get that grain of corn.” She threw another 
grain of corn. The hen ran to get it, the cock passed her. She 
said, “Shoo! greedy cock! If you remembered the day I told you 
to take the poor horse, and you took the good one; that I said our 
father is after us; that the horse turned into a church, you turned 
into a saint, and I turned into a priest; that my father asked 
me if I had seen any one passing; that I said to him, ‘This is a 
fine mass we are holding, come in!’— if you remembered, you 
would let the hen get that grain of corn.” She threw another 
grainofcorn. The hen ran to get it, the cock passed her. “Shoo! 
greedy cock! If you remembered the day that our father was 
after us again, our horse turned into a garden, you into a flower, 
I into a flower-seller; that father asked me if I had seen any one 
pass by; that I said, ‘The flowers are five reis apiece,"— if you 
remembered, you would let the hen get that grain of corn.” She 
threw another grain of corn. The hen ran to get it, the cock 
passed her. “Shoo! greedy cock! If you remembered the day 
that our mother was after us, our horse turned into a sea, you 
into a boat, I into a rower; that mother swam after us; that I 
threw the key at her, it hit her in the eye, it put it out; that she 
put upon me the curse that when I landed you would forget me 
for seven years, seven months, seven weeks, seven days, seven 
hours, seven minutes, seven seconds, seven divisions of the world, 
and when we landed, you left me in the hut of a chicken-raiser; 
that I told you to let nobody touch you on the head,— if you 
remembered, you would let the hen get that grain of corn.”1 As 
she spoke the last word in the last second, Manuel remembered 
White-Flower. It was one second to his wedding. He called 
the king. “Sir King, I have something to say to you. If you 
had a key and lost it, and had a new key made and then found 
the old key, which of them would you use?” The king said to 
him, ‘‘The old key.” He said, “That woman there was my wife, 
and it is she I am going to marry.”

(Variant a2) 
There was a boy who was a gambler by profession. There was 
nobody, old or young, who could beat him. He was known 
throughout the land. One night a man came to his house. “Are 
you the boy who is the best gambler in town?” —“‘Yes.”—“T'd 
like to play with you to-night.”—“‘Yes, let us play, each bet to be 
one thousand dollars.” They played cards all night. The man 
won every game. The boy lost all his money but twenty dollars. 
He gambled away his house, his mother, his father, and himself. 
On leaving, the man said, ‘I have won your mother and father. 
I don’t want them. I want you. A week from to-day come to 
my house. I live in White-Sand-Yellow-Water [4re’a Branca 
Agua ’Marella).” 
The boy started out to find the man’s place. He went to the 
house of Mother-of-Moon (Ma’ di Lua). ‘Can you tell me 
where White-Sand-Yellow-Water is?” She answered, “No, but 
wait a little. I have a son who travels all over the world. Per- 
haps he can tell you.” When Moon came home, she asked him. 
He did not know. They sent the boy on to the house of Mother- 
of-Sun (Mae de Sol). “Can you tell me where White-Sand- 
Yellow-Water is?”—‘‘No, but wait till my son comes home.” 
Sun did not know. The boy went on to the house of Mother-of- 
Winds (Mae de Vent’). “Can you tell me where White-Sand- 
Yellow-Water is?” —‘‘No, wait for my son. He goes everywhere. 
I shall have to tie you to that po/on. When my son arrives, he 
blows everything away. He might blow you away too.” He 
[Wind] came with an earthquake. He said, “‘ Mother, I smell royal 
blood.” —“‘Yes, my son, there is a boy here waiting to ask you 
if you know the way to White-Sand-Yellow-Water.”—“ Yes, it 
is not a few minutes since I slept there, but it is a long way from 
here.— Boy, have you any money?”-—“‘I have twenty dollars.” — 
“Goto that cave. There lives a bird called John’s Bird [Pass’ de

back here, so I may see what I can do for you.” John’s Bird had 
a man’s face and the wings of a bird. He asked the boy to supply 
an ox and cut it in four quarters, and to supply four hogsheads 
of water. The boy returned to Wind. Wind said, “Here are

four hogsheads for you, and four po/lon-seeds.” John’s Bird 
came, and said, “Give me two quarters of the ox and two hogs- 
heads to put under my right wing, and two quarters and two hogs- 
heads to put under my left wing. Do you mount on my back.” 
Then he flew up, up, up. “What does the world look like?” 
asked John’s Bird. ‘‘Very small, as small as the point of a pin,” 
answered the boy. John’s Bird said, ‘‘We are in danger of our 
lives.” The boy remembered his po/on-seeds, he threw one into 
the air. It formed a polon-tree. John’s Bird alighted on it, 
ate one quarter of the beef, and drank one hogshead of water. 
They flew on again, flew, flew, flew. ‘‘What does the world look 
like?”.—“‘As small as the point of a needle.” —‘‘ We are in danger 
of our lives.” The boy threw down another polon-seed, a tree 
formed, John’s Bird alighted on it, and ate a quarter and drank 
a hogshead. They flew on again. “What does the world look 
like?” —“‘It looks very far away. I see what looks like a little 
cloud far away near a cliff.” He threw down another po/on-seed. 
John’s Bird ate the third quarter and drank up the third hogshead. 
They flew on. “What does the world look like?”—‘Like a 
button on top of a bottle.” He threw down the last po/on-seed. 
John’s Bird alighted and ate and drank. They flewon. “What 
does the world look like?”—‘“‘It looks like a ’senta da rocha.’— 
“We have still a distance to go, but I can’t carry you. There is 
nothing more to eat. I’m going back, but I will give you a 
direction.” He flew downwards and put the boy on the ground. 
“You see those three banana-trees? There you will find a woman 
to direct you. She is Fatma, Mother-of-Charity [Mdé de Cari- 
dade). Adieu!” We walked to the banana-trees. There sat a 
woman praying over a rosary. He said, “Good-day, Lady 
Fatma! ”—‘Oh, a live Christian! Never have I seen one here 
before. What are you doing here?”—“ Aunt, I am looking for a 
man who lives at White-Sand-Yellow-Water.”—“Well, my son, 
it isa dangerous place you are bound for. Do you see over there 
that pond of water?”-—“‘I see it.” —‘‘Go there and hide. A little 
black duck will come there. Let her alone. Next will come a 
little spotted duck. Let her alone. Third will come a white 
duck. Do your best to get one of her feathers. There is the 
guide to the place you seek.” When the white duck dived, he 
pulled out a feather from her tail. When she came to the top of 
the water, she became aware of the loss of the feather, and said, 
“Pond, if you have my feather, return it to me, and I will give

you whatever you wish.” She went to the banana-trees, and 
there she saw the boy. ‘‘Man of God, if you have my feather, 
return it tome; and whenever you are in trouble, I will help you.” 
He gave it to her. She turned into a girl. She asked, ‘Where 
are you going?” He answered, “I am going to White-Sand- 
Yellow-Water.”—‘‘Handsome boy, my father is awaiting you 
there to make you his slave.” He began to weep. She said, 
“Don’t weep! I am the stewardess of that house. My name is 
Maria Flor dos Veila. Come with me.” They went until they 
reached a castle. She said, “My father will send you to me for 
food. Then we can talk together.” The man answered his 
knock at the door. He said, “‘I see you are a man of your word. 
I was not expecting you. Take this little dried-up orange-tree, 
plant it, and to-morrow morning bring me an orange from it for 
breakfast.” When he went to Maria for food, he was weeping. 
“Jonsi di Lembras, why do you weep?” —“‘I have reason to weep. 
Your father gave me a little dried-up orange-tree. He told me to 
plant it and bring him an orange from it to-morrow for break- 
fast.”—“‘Oh, that is nothing. Eat, and lie down. Put your 
head in my lap, and I will scratch it.” He lay down and went to 
sleep. When he awoke, she brought him a basket of ripe oranges. 
She said, “‘Take these to my father.” 
The man said, ‘You are smart. Take this cornstalk, plant it, 
and bring me some green corn.” Again he went weeping to Maria 
Flor. “Don’t weep! That is nothing. Eat, and lay your head 
again in my lap. I will scratch your head.” When he awoke, 
she gave him a basket of corn to take to her father. “You are 
smart,” said he. ‘“‘Go to Maria and get food, then return to me, 
Thave a great task for you.” Maria asked, “What did my father 
tell you to-day?””—“‘He said he had a great task for me.”— “Sit 
down. To-day you must eat well.” She brought a dando and 
tied it around him. “To-day you will have to break a wild mule. 
That mule will be my father.” He said, “This will be the last 
day of my life. I never rode such an animal.”—‘ Listen to me!” 
said Maria, “the crupper will be my mother; the right stirrup, 
my oldest sister; the left stirrup, my next sister; the bridle and 
reins, I. Beat the mule and beat on the crupper all you can. I 
will give you a club [manduc’]. You will find the mule in the 
yard. He will try to make you pass him on the left, but pass him 
on the right. You will not see my father, you will only hear his 
voice telling you to take the mule.” The boy heard a voice say-

ing, “Take that mule and bring him back trained. That is all 
you have to do to-day.” The mule started off kicking and jump- 
ing. He beat him with his club until he bled. When‘he brought 
him back to the gate, he struck him so hard he broke the crupper. 
He left the mule trembling. He went in, and said to the man, 
“The mule is quiet now.” The man said, “I can’t pay much 
attention to you. I am sick with a pain in my stomach.” The 
old woman was sick too with a pain in her back. 
Maria said to him, ‘“‘We must leave here to-day. My father 
will try to kill you. Listen carefully! Go and get the horse called 
Thought [Pensamento].” He was so frightened, that, instead of 
Thought, he took Wind. Maria said, “You did not listen. I told 
you to take Thought. You took Wind. We have no time to 
change, but they will overtake us. Wait here at the door. I am 
going in to arrange with them. Then, as soon as I come back, we 
start.” She went in and spit on the four corners of the table. 
She came out and said, ‘“‘Let us mount and be off! I am not 
afraid of my father. I am afraid of my mother. Still I can get 
the better of her.” The father called, ‘‘Maria Flor dos Veila!”’ 
One of the four drops of spittle answered, ‘‘ Yes, father.”-—‘‘ Make 
me some soup, because you have no father but me.” The spittle 
dried up. Maria said to the boy, “Now my father is calling me.” 
The man called again. The second drop of spittle answered. 
He called again, the third drop answered. He called again, the 
fourth drop answered. The fifth time he got no answer. He 
called again, no answer. His wife said, “I told you long ago that 
Maria was helping that boy. Now they are gone. Go after 
them!” 
He went, went, went. Maria said, “My father is after us. I 
will turn into a little cow, and you into a bull at pasture by the 
roadside.” The man came up and saw them, and said, “A fine 
pair! I’d like to buy them if I knew to whom they belonged.” 
He returned home. His wife asked, ‘What did you see?” —“Only 
a little cow and a bull. I wanted to buy them.”—“‘O you fool 
[éru?]! That little cow was Maria, the bull was Jodo. Go after 
them again!” Maria said, “Father is after us. It was you got 
us into all this trouble. If only you had taken Thought!” She 
turned into a church, he into the priest and the acolyte (’studante) 
and all the people in church. The father went into the church, 
he knelt and said a prayer. Then he returned home. His wife 
asked, ““What did you see?”—“O girl [menina]! I saw a church

the like of which you never saw in your life!” —“‘O fool! That 
church was Maria, the priest and acolyte and the people were Jodo. 
Go after them again!”—“‘I can’t go again. I have a pain in my 
stomach.”—‘‘Go! you must go!” And he went. Maria said, 
“O Jesus! he is after us again.” Maria turned into a field of 
sugarcane; Jodo, into the press (¢ripixe) and the workmen. The 
father came by and spoke to the men. ‘‘Have you seen anybody 
passing this way?”—“‘No, we are too busy to notice passers-by.” 
He returned home. ‘What did you see?”-—“I saw a field of 
sugarcane and some workmen.”—‘“‘O fool! stay here. You are 
no good. I am going myself.”—‘‘Wa!” exclaimed Maria, “my 
mother is afterus! I am going to prepare a tube (canud’) of ashes 
to blind her, so she cannot see her way.” The mother called, 
“T see you, Maria, I see where you are going!” Maria threw 
back a tube of ashes. The mother blew the ashes away. Every 
time she blew, the cloud moved a mile off. After she had passed 
beyond it, she called, ‘Maria, I am going to catch you!” Maria 
threw back another tube. It turned into rocks. The old woman 
took her machad’ and cut her way through. She called out, 
“Maria, I am going to catch you both!”” Maria threw behind her 
a handful of salt. It turned into a sea, into the sea of San Anton. 
The old woman swam, swam, swam, until she was tired. She 
called, “Maria, you were the keeper of my keys. Throw me the 
key of my trunk.” Maria said to Jod0, “Take this key. Throw 
it straight, and put out one of her eyes.” The key struck the old 
woman. She cried, “O you ingrate!”’ Raising her hands, she 
said, “May Jodo leave you for seven years and seven days in the 
year of the Trinity [”o ano da Trinidad|\” 
Maria and Jodo went on until they reached his country. They 
made land the Day of All Saints (Dia di Tud’ Sant) Maria 
said, “I am going to stay here on this beach. You go on home to 
see your people. Remember to-day is the Day of All Saints. 
Remember the curse my mother laid on me. Go, but do not lie 
down to sleep. They will embrace you; but do not let them 
embrace you on the left side, only on the right side? If they 
embrace you on the left, you will forget me.” They made a feast

on his return home. Every one was so glad to see him, they 
embraced him on both sides. He forgot her. 
After seven years and seven days had elapsed, Maria started for 
the city where Jodo lived. By this time Jodd was married. Near 
the city Maria met a little bitch. It ran ahead of her, stopped 
at Jodo’s door, and went in and upstairs. The servant put her 
head through the window. Maria asked her for a glass of water. 
The servant reported to her mistress that outside a good-looking 
woman was asking for a drink of water. The lady looked out and 
called her in. She offered her refreshments, and went out to 
bring themin. Jodo entered and sat down there. Maria threw a 
fruit (maricuja) into his lap, and said, “‘Do you know the name of 
that fruit?”—‘‘No.”—‘It is Mariacusida [‘Maria forgotten’].”’ 
He wondered. She went on, “Mariacusida is Maria Flor dos 
Veila, who was forgotten on a beach by the sea. Do you remem- 
ber when you parted from her on that beach by the sea?” He 
answered, “It was the first day of November. I have been in a 
trance. Give me your hand.” In came the lady. He said to 
her, “This woman is my wife. She is my first key. I am going 
to keep the first key to my lock the rest of my life.” They sent 
for judges to judge the case. The judges decided that Maria Flor 
dos Veila should be his wife. 
(Variant b) 
There was a man had more money than all the money the 
world over. He had three sons. Two of them were gamblers. 
Every day they took three, four, five, bags of money, and went to 
the king’s house to play with the queen and princess. Every 
day the king and his family won everything, and the boys went 
home cleaned out (imp’). They gambled away half their father’s 
- fortune, to his amazement. He fell sick. He sent for his sons 
who were gambling at the king’s house. He said to them, “I am 
going to divide my money. I am going to die.” He divided his 
money in two parts, he took out one hundred dollars for the 
youngest son (coude), whom he loved the most. The youngest was 
almost weeping. He said, “Besides the money they have gambled 
away, you give them ten bags of money, each bag holding ten 
bushels; and to me you give only one hundred dollars!” The 
father gave the youngest a pack of cards; he said to him, “Don’t 
sell them for any amount of money.” Next day the two older

brothers took each four bags of money and went to gamble in the 
king’s house. The father died. The youngest went after his 
brothers to bury their father. They all mourned for fifteen days. 
Then the two went back to gamble at the king’s house. The next 
morning the youngest took his one hundred dollars and his pack of 
cards and started into the world. He came to the king’s house, 
and saw his two brothers there gambling. Each had a bet of 
twenty thousand dollars with the king; the queen and princess 
were out of it (ja pista). By midnight they had gambled every- 
thing away, including their clothes. The king and queen ran 
them out. The king saw the youngest standing there. He said, 
“Maybe you can gamble too. How much money have you?”— 
“T have one hundred dollars.” The king put a pack of cards on 
the table. “Cut them,” said he. “No. I'll play only with my 
own pack, the finest cards in the world.” The king bet one hun- 
dred dollars. The boy put one hundred with the king’s one 
hundred. He turned the cards, drew three cards, and won two 
hundred dollars. He shuffled, the king cut, and bet two hundred 
dollars. He drew four cards and fourchundred dollars. Finally 
the king was betting twenty thousand dollars at a bet. The boy 
won all the king’s property, he left him not a single penny (um de’ 
reis). He won his house, his clothes, the queen’s clothes, the 
clothes of the princess. The princess was as pretty as the gold 
of Turta Huntin. She begged him to sell her the pack of cards. 
“Not for any price. My father left them to me, he told me not 
to sell them for any thing or to any body.” —“If you give them to 
me, I will lie with you,” said the princess. When he left her 
room, she proposed to him to gamble again. She won every bet. 
About four o’clock the youth was cleaned out. They ran him 
outdoors. : 
He found himself on a beach; when the sun rose, he saw a man 
in white riding towards him on a white horse. “Why are you 
so sad?” asked the horseman. “I have reason to be sad. My 
father left me one hundred dollars and a pack of cards. I played 
with the king, and I won all his money. The princess offered to 
lie with me if I gave her the cards. Then she played with me and 
left me cleaned out, as you see me now.”—‘If you will divide 
your winnings with me, I will help you to win back the money.” 
He pricked the boy’s arm with a pocket-knife, and with the blood 
he wrote on a piece of paper that he was to meet him at a certain 
place on a certain day. He gave him one hundred dollars and a

pack of cards.’ He returned to the king’s house and won every- 
thing back from the princess. Again she offered to lie with him 
in return for his cards. He beat her and pulled out her eye. He 
put everybody out of doors and took possession. 
One day as he was hunting, feeling like a smoke, he pulled out 
his strike-a-light (fuzi/) from his hunting-bag (sac’ de mont’). Out 
fell the note the horseman had given him. He read that this was 
the very day he was to meet him. He went home, he went to the 
stable, he took out a horse that ran faster than an express-train, 
and in three jumps he was at the appointed place. But the man 
had waited for him and had left. He followed his tracks. He 
went, went, went,— as far as from here to Boston. Night fell. 
He came to a hut in which lived an old man,— a man older than 
my own grandfather, who died when he was four hundred and fifty- 
nine. He said, ‘My friend, did a man in white, riding a white 
horse, pass here?” —“‘Yes, and, judging from the time he passed, 
you can’t overtake him. Spend the night here.” He was 
hungry, his horse too. The old man gathered some garden waste 
and driftwood for the horse, and invited the boy into the hut. 
He told him he would find a little pot on the fire boiling. The 
pot was the size of an eggshell. Then the old man pulled out 
from under the bed a dish of food, he put it in front of the boy. 
In the morning the horse was so fat, the cinch broke. To replace 
it the old man brought out from under the bed ten fathoms of 
rope. He rode, rode, rode,— from here to Norwich. Night fell. 
He reached a beach, where he found the same old man. “My 
friend, did a man in white, riding a white horse, pass here?” — 
“Yes, and, judging from the time he passed, you can’t overtake 
him. Spend the night here. On the fire you will find the pot 
boiling.” The pot was the size of a bluejay’s egg. The old man 
pulled out from under the bed a dish holding three-quarters of an 
alges. is horse was so fat in the morning, the rope broke. The 
old man gave him more rope. After he left, and was as far as 
from here to the corner, the old man called, “Eh! The man you 
have a contract with is not a man, he is a devil. He has two 
daughters, one named Sun [So/], one named Moon [Lua]. 
When you arrive, if you find Sun at the door, he will succeed in

killing you; if you find Moon, you will escape.” Moon was at the 
door. “O lady! where is your father?”—“In the court looking 
at the flowers. Go and strike him three times across his shoulders. 
Otherwise he will kill you.” The devil had one eye in the middle 
of his forehead as big as a bullet (4a/a de carga). When he felt 
the blows, he turned and looked; he said, “Is this the day we 
agreed to meet?” —“‘No.”’—“‘Go into the house. We have many 
a dance to dance.” He gave the boy the stock of a banana-tree a 
hundred years old and rotten. He said to him, ‘‘Plant this, and 
from it bring me a ripe banana to-morrow morning before I go to 
church.” He went, crying. Moon said, ““Why do you weep?” — 
“Your father intends to kill me. He gave me this banana to 
plant, and from it to bring him a ripe banana to-morrow morning 
before he goes to church.” Moon said, “To-morrow morning 
’ dig a little hole in the court, I will spit into it three times, plant 
this in the hole, turn around, and you will find a ripe banana to 
take to him.” The next morning, when he cut the bunch of 
bananas, it took nine men to carry it in. When the bananas 
were put on the table, the woman said, “O husband! this is the 
art of our daughter Moon!” He said to her, “I can kill bigger 
men than this boy.” He gave him a dried-up grape-vine two 
hundred years old to plant, to pick the grapes, to squeeze them, 
and to produce three bottles of wine for breakfast the next morn- 
ing. Moon met him crying; she said, “To-morrow morning dig 
a little hole in the garden, into it I will spit three times, then plant 
the vine.” When he turned around, there were nine baskets of 
grapes and three bottles of white wine. When he took them to 
the devil, the devil said, ‘To-morrow morning I am going to 
give you the wildest horse I have to break.” He went crying to 
Moon. “That’s my mother he will give you to break. She goes 
before [faster than] the wind. She is the biggest witch in the 
world. Ask him for a good saddle and spur. She will jump 
ninety miles high and reach the sky.” He jumped on her, he 
beat her, he drove his spur into her. He broke her in, he rode 
her back. 
The devil and his wife went to mass. Moon said, “Pedr’, go 
to the stable and take out the horse called Feeling [Sentid’] for us 
to ride away on. My mother and father intend to kill us both 
to-day.” He went to the stable, and forgot and took Wind 
(Vent’). “Let me go back for Feeling,” he said. ‘No, there is 
no time, mother and father are coming.” They jumped on the

horse; they went, went, went. When they found the two gone, 
the woman beat the devil three times across his shoulders. He 
fell on his face, he lost five teeth, he loosened six. He went, 
went, went. Pedr’ turned, and said, ‘“‘Moon, your father is after 
us.” —‘T am not afraid of my father. I am afraid of my mother. 
J will turn into a corral of goats and into the cheeses in it. You 
turn into an old herd. Father will ask you to sell him a cheese; 
but don’t sell any, for, if you do, it’s me you'll sell.””. The devil 
came up and asked the old herd to sell him a cheese. The herd 
refused. ‘Have you seen a man and a woman pass here?”— 
“No; since I have been here, you are the first man I’ve seen.” 
He went on a bit and then returned home. His wife asked, 
“What did you see?”—“I saw the finest herd of goats, and an 
old man herding them. Their cheeses were the finest I ever 
saw.”—‘‘You fool!” exclaimed she. “The cheeses were your 
daughter; the old man, that boy.” She beat him over the head, 
she said he had to go again. ‘Moon, your father is with us.”— 
“T tell you, I am not afraid of my father. I am afraid of my 
mother. J’ll turn into a church with saints around the altar, 
and roses, and you turn into the old sacristan. He will ask to 
buy the flowers. Don’t sell any; for, if you do, you will sell me.” 
The devil asked the sacristan to sell him some flowers. He re- 
fused. On his return his wife asked what he saw. “I saw the 
finest church in the world. On its altar were roses, and there was 
an old sacristan.”—“‘You fool! The roses were our daughter; and 
the sacristan, that boy.” She beat him on the-nape of his neck. 
She broke sixteen of his teeth, and left forty-eight loose. He 
started out again. ‘‘Moon, your father is with us.”—“I am not 
afraid of my father. Iam afraid of my mother. I'll turn into a 
fish, and you into the fisherman who has caught me and thrown 
me up on the rocks.” The devil came up, and said to the fisher- 
man, “O my friend! have you seen a man and a woman pass here?” 
The fisherman answered, “The fish are four for four cents.” 
The devil returned home. ‘What did you see?” asked his wife. 
“I saw a fisherman and his fish. He said they were four for four 
cents.”——“You fool! You needn’t go again. I am going my- 
self.” She jumped on her dorbodec (the borbodec was a devil).t 
She said, “Borbodec, borbodec, Vll give you blood to drink.”— 
“Moon, your mother is with us.”-~“‘My mother knows a lot, 
but I know more. [Pll turn into a vessel with forty-nine masts;

and you turn into the pilot sailing her, with a fair wind out to sea.” 
The mother spurred her Jordodec, he jumped into the sea. They 
swam, swam, swam. She called out, “Moon, the devil will get 
you. I am the old woman Montalon.” The wave broke and 
swept old woman and borbodec back to the shore. She ran her 
hand over the back of the Jorbedec, and the dorbodec kicked her in 
the leg. “‘O dorbodec! you fooled me, but I won’t fool myself,” 
said she, and she jumped into the sea. She was blind in one eye. 
She swam twenty-two days after the ship. Then she became 
tired. She called out, ““O Moon! I am tired. Throw me the 
key of my trunk.” Moon threw the key at her. It struck her 
on her good eye. She called out, “Wherever the prince [?] lands 
with you, may he leave you and forget you for seven years, seven 
months, seven days, seven divisions of the world!” When she 
returned home, she said to her husband, “See what our daughter 
has done to me!” —“Yes, that is what you went to get.” 
Moon and Pedr’ made shore. Then the curse (malaison) fell 
on her. Pedr’ said, “You wait here, and I will fetch my two 
brothers. We will get married here.” Moon said, “Go, but 
don’t let any creature touch you, speak with no one until you 
reach your house.” In the house was a little dog that was his. 
As he approached, the dog ran out and jumped up on him. Im- 
mediately he forgot Moon. 
Moon was a good worker, and she built herself a house sixteen 
stories high. She grew rich. She kept a servant. The report 
spread in the city that a rich woman lived on the shore. Three 
brothers decided to go see who she was. Each put four hundred 
dollars in his pocket. As they passed she called them in. They 
were afraid to sit down — on the chairs of gold. Moon had gold 
teeth which cost one thousand dollars apiece. When the eldest 
brother saw her, he admired her. He asked her to sell him a 
night! for four hundred dollars. She had a gourd (4u/i) of whale- 
oil five hundred years old. After they had gone to bed, the ser- 
vant called, “‘Mistress [VAanha], I want some oil for a light.” 
Moon said, “There’s oil in the closet. I will get up and get it for 
you.” She was on the back part of the bed, he was in front. 
“No,” said he, “I'll get it.” Out jumped the stopper from the 
gourd. The gourd kept following him about, dropping oil on 
him, so that in the morning he was as greasy as an old oil-tank.

The next night the second brother came. In the middle of the 
night the servant called, ‘‘Mistress, can’t you give me the horn 
with the spices?”? She started up. He said, “Oh, a woman 
always wants to be ahead. I can get it more quickly than you.” 
He went to the closet for the horn. It kept picking at him all 
night. At sunrise he went home. The third night her own 
husband came. The servant cried, ‘‘ Mistress, I can’t sleep for the 
bedbugs and flies. Can’t you give me the Portuguese guitar? I 
want to amuse myself.” She started to get up, but he was before 
her. The guitar came at him, at his breast, and he had to keep 
playing it until sunrise. He did not feel cheerful. He asked, 
“Will you sell me another night?”—‘Yes, for four hundred 
dollars.” He paid her, and started for home. She called, “Eh! 
Don’t speak to any one as you go home until you are in your 
house!”” At that moment the curse was lifted. When he reached 
home, the little dog started to jump up on him, and he struck him 
dead. Then he remembered his wife. He called in forty priests 
to marry them. This very day I passed by, and in his house I ate 
of the feast he began to give sixteen years ago.

53. BLUFF. 
There were two compadres,— Monkey and Dog. Monkey 
went to the blacksmith. He said to him, “‘I want you to make me 
such a knife, that, when I cut my compadre with it, he will defecate. 
The blacksmith said, “Good!”? Monkey said to him, “What day 
can I.come for the knife?”—‘‘Come Saturday.” Dog went to 
the blacksmith. He said to him, “I want you to make me such a 
knife, that,when I cut my compadre with it, he will defecate.” The 
blacksmith said, ‘‘Good!” Dog said to him, “What day can I 
come for it?” —“‘Come Saturday.” Saturday the two met at the 
smith’s. The smith said to Dog, “I forget what kind of a knife 
you told me you wanted.”—‘‘Such a knife, that, when I cut my 
compadre with it, he will defecate.” He turned to Monkey; he 
said to him, “Tell me again what kind of a knife you want.” 
Monkey answered, “‘I have told you once. Make it.” 
Monkey had a place where he was on watch. Dog came into 
sight. Monkey called out loud to him, “Don’t cross here! 
There’s no road here!” Dog kept on coming until they started 
in to fight. Dog stuck his knife into Monkey. He seized him, 
he began to shake him. He knocked him on the ground in seven 
places. In each one of the seven places he shook him, Monkey 
defecated a little pile. Then Dog let Monkey go, he went his way. 
A man came along. Monkey called out loud to him, “Don’t 
cross here! There is no road here!”” The man began to come on 
arun. Monkey said to him, “I told you not to come through 
here; you come, anyhow. I am going todo to you what I did to 
Compa’ Dog.” He showed the man the seven places and the 
seven little piles of droppings. The man said to him, “I have 
some grass here; when I squeeze it on any one’s droppings, the 
fellow dies.” He started to squeeze the grass on one of the little 
piles. Monkey cried, “Wait, that is mine!” The man went to 
another. ‘“‘Wait, that’s mine too!” The man said to him, “I 
believe you did it all yourself.” ? Monkey said to him, ‘What 
difference does it make to you if I did it? I did it on my ¢ own 
land.” ' 
(Variant a.) 
Dog went to the house of the blacksmith. ‘Make a knife for 
me to hit Sir Compadre Monkey with.” Monkey went to the

house of blacksmith. He told the blacksmith to make a knife to 
hit Sir Compadre Monkey with where his droppings staid on the 
ground. He said, “Come and get the knife Saturday.” Satur- 
day both of them went to the house of the blacksmith to get the 
knife, and the blacksmith asked Monkey what he said “for me to 
make him a knife for.” He said to him, ‘‘We spoke of that 
before.” A knife to each. Monkey had a big farm. Dog came 
by the farm. Monkey said, “Don’t come by here, because there 
is no road here.” Dog continued to come. When Dog came, 
they fought. Each time Dog threw him on the ground, his 
droppings staid there. He threw him down seven times. Seven 
times, seven piles of droppings. Came by aman. Monkey told 
the man not to come because there was no road there. The man 
came. Monkey said to the man, “See how I did to my Compadre 
Dog!” The man picked up a blade of green grass, above the 
droppings. Monkey said, “Wait, I will see if itis mine. This is 
mine. As you put me down here, the droppings fell.” The man 
again squeezed the fresh grass on the droppings. He said, “Don’t 
do it to me, wait. This ismine. As he threw me down here, the 
droppings fell from me here.” The man said, “It is you who let 
go here.” He said to him, “It is my place; it didn’t make any 
difference.” 
(Variant 62) 
Wolf, Dog, Monkey, owned some land together. Wolf and 
Monkey were lazy, they did not work. Sir Dog was a good work- 
man, he bought out the shares of Wolf and Monkey. He planted 
sugarcane, manioc, potatoes. Wolf and Monkey would go. to 
the field and say, “If we take something, Compadre won’t say any- 
thing.” Dog began to watch; he watched, watched, watched, 
until there was a big pile of manioc by the side of the field. One 
day Dog lay down behind it. He saw them coming. Monkey 
said, “If I take a piece of manioc, Compadre won’t say anything.” 
Wolf said, “If I take a piece of manioc, Compadre won’t say any- 
thing.” They pulled up the manioc, they started to lay the 
pieces on the pile of manioc by the side of which Dog was hiding. 
Dog grabbed them by the leg. They pulled, pulled, until they 
escaped. 
Wolf said to Monkey, ‘‘ Yesterday we went to Compadre Dog’s 
field, he caught us. To-day we'll act so he will have to go to the

blacksmith. We will go ourselves to the house of the smith, we 
will tell him to make us a sword.”” Sir Dog knew they had gone 
to the blacksmith, he thought he had to go too. When he went, 
he found them sitting there. He said, “Compa’ Blacksmith, 
make me a big sword, so that when I strike Monkey and Wolf 
with it, they will defecate all the manioc of mine they have eaten.” 
The blacksmith turned to Wolf and Monkey; he said to them, “I 
forget what you told me you wanted me to make for you.” They 
answered, “‘A little knife for us to shave with.” With his sword 
Dog cut open the bellies of Monkey and Wolf. All that manioc 
came out. 
54. THE GIRL WHO DID NOT LIKE MEN.) 
There was a girl who did not like men. She said if she could 
find some one who was not a man, she would marry him. A cer- 
tain man turned into a woman and married her. One day a 
neighbor said to her, “When we are sad, we have something we 
play with that makes us feel good.” The girl said to her husband, 
“Go buy or borrow the thing that will make us feel good.” He 
went out and returned; he said to her, “I have it, but on condi- 
tion that I return it to-morrow. It was hard work to borrow it 
at all.’ They played that night together. Next day the girl 
said, “Don’t take it back! Tell them you have lost it.”—“ 
must take it back. They might charge me very dearly for it.” 
He went out and returned; he said to her, “They tell me they will 
sell it for two hundred thousand res.” The girl was rich, she 
gave him the money to buy it.. That night they played together 
again. The next day he went out. When he came back, he told 
her that he had lost it. The girl said, “Let us look for it!” He 
said, ““You said you didn’t like men.” She answered, “But I 
didn’t know what a man was.’—“You had a foolish idea. No 
king, no high person, but is a man, and a man is the work of God.” 
She said to him, “I gave you two hundred dollars to become a 
man. You became a man, and then you lost what belongs to a 
man.” The girl grew angry. She said to him, “Give me my two 
hundred dollars. Go away! Now I am going to marry a man.” 
He was testing her, he went out, he made out that he was looking 
for what he had. On his return he found that the girl had already 
arranged another marriage; but when he said to her that he had

found the thing that made him a man, the girl gave up marrying 
another. They lived very contentedly together. Her neighbor 
came in to see her. She said to her, “How is it nowadays you 
are contented?””—“ Because I found the thing that you played 
with to make you contented, and it has made me contented too.”’ 
She did not let her husband go out, for fear of his losing what made 
him a man. She came to have a child. She asked pardon of 
God for what she had said about men. 
55. THE YOUTH AND HIS HORSE! 
There was a man married a long time to a woman without 
having children. He went toa said’ fora remedy. After a while 
they had a son. At the time of his birth a foal was born. They 
gave it to the boy. While the boy was at school, his father died. 
The sais’ asked the woman to marry him. She said, ‘“‘No, I 
can’t, on account of the boy.” The said’ said, “I can give you 
means to kill him. When he leaves for school, put what I give 
you above the door. As soon as he comes in from school, it will 
kill him.” Before he went to school, the boy threw hay down for 
his horse. On his way back he found this hay untouched. “What 
is the matter?” he asked his horse. The horse answered, ‘I 
don’t eat to-day because to-day your mother plans to kill you.” — 
“Tell me about it.”—‘Go into the house by the back door,” 
said the horse. The next day the said’ asked, “Is he not yet 
dead?”’—“Not yet.”—‘‘To-morrow put poison into his dinner.”” 
Before going to school the boy threw hay down for his horse, and 
on his return found it untouched. “What is the matter?” he 
asked. “I don’t eat to-day because to-day your mother has 
poisoned your dinner. Don’t eat it. When your mother asks 
why, say you eat only the food you see cooked.” When he came 
in, his mother said, “I have a fine dinner for you.” He answered, 
“Throw that fine dinner off the highest of cliffs or into the deepest 
part of the sea.” The next day the said’ asked, “Is he not yet 
dead?” —“‘Not yet.”—“To-morrow put poison under his pillow.” 
The boy threw down hay for his horse, and on his return found it 
untouched. ‘What is the matter?”—‘I don’t eat to-day be- 
cause to-day your mother has put poison under your pillow. Tell 
her you won’t sleep in that bed. You sleep only where she

sleeps.” The next day the said’ asked, “Is he not yet dead?” — 
“Not yet.”—‘It is: his horse that is saving him. To-morrow 
pretend you are sick. I’ll come as a doctor with my book. Ask 
me what I see in my book. I'll read out that the only remedy 
for you is the liver of the boy’s horse.” The boy threw down hay 
for his horse, and on his return found it untouched. ‘What is 
the matter?”—“I don’t eat to-day because to-day they plan to 
killme. Your mother will say she is sick and that her only remedy 
is my liver. Ask her to let you first ride me three times. Each 
time put on a different suit of your father’s.” When the boy 
went in, his mother said, “I am sick. The doctor says only the 
liver of your horse will cure me. What’s a little thing like your 
horse?” The boy said, “First let me ride him about three times. 
I have never ridden him.”” The boy took him out and rode him, 
each time having changed his suit of clothes. The third time the 
horse ran with him, and ran so hard that before he was aware 
he was in another country. His horse said, “Don’t tell your 
name. (His name was Pedr’ Canarvalh’.) Call yourself Billes- 
meu. I shall disappear, leaving you a strike-a-light. When you 
want me, say, ‘From strike-a-light a mule,’ and I will turn into 
a mule. When you say, ‘From mule to strike-a-light,’ I will 
turn into a strike-a-light. Whatever they do to you, don’t tell 
your name.” He walked on to the king’s house, he arrived in a 
sorry state. ‘‘What is your name?” they asked. He answered, 
“Billesmeu.” They beat him. “What is your name?”—“Bil- 
lesmeu.” And they beat him and beat him. They kept asking, 
and he kept answering “ Billesmeu,” and they beat him until he 
bled. ‘Sunday the king went to church. Then the youth said 
to his strike-a-light, “From strike-a-light to mule. Dress me 
up in fine clothes.” In his fine clothes he went into the garden 
and played with the princess. When the king was returning from 
church, he called on his strike-a-light, and he disappeared. The 
princess told her people that the handsomest youth she had ever 
seen had been with her. The next Sunday, when the king went 
to church, the youth played again with the princess, and on the 
return of the king disappeared. The third Sunday the princess 
decided to watch where he disappeared. She saw him go behind 
the hill and become Billesmeu. The next day, when they asked 
him his name, and he answered, “‘Billesmeu, Billesmeu, Billes- 
meu,” the princess begged them not to beat him. “You are the 
only one to stand up for him,” they said.

The king had three servants, Billesmeu made the fourth. 
The king’s eye was affected. The doctor said only the water 
from a certain well would cure the eye. The king sent his ser- 
vants to fetch the water, sending the three on good horses, and 
Billesmeu on a wretched old horse. He said, “From strike-a- 
light to mule, give me a good horse.” On his good horse he rode 
ahead of the others, and got the water. He said, ‘From strike- 
a-light to mule, turn me into an old man sitting by the side of the 
well.” He muddied the water. The three servants arrived. 
He asked, “What do you want?”—‘‘We came for water.”— 
“To-day to get water you must take down your trousers and let 
me strike you.” Every time he struck he printed his name on 
their buttocks. He left them, and said, “From strike-a-light to 
mule, give me back my good horse.”” Herodeon ahead. He said, 
“From strike-a-light to mule, turn me back into Billesmeu.” 
On his old horse he met the three servants returning. “Where 
are you going?” they asked. “To get the water from the well.” 
They said, “There was an old man there who tried to keep us from 
getting the water. How will you ever get it?”—‘‘I won’t try 
to get it,” said he. They took their water to the king. He used 
it and thought he was going blind. His daughter said, “Sir King, 
Billesmeu has some water. Let us try it!” The water cured 
the king. Thereafter they treated him a little better. They let 
him eat at a table apart. 
One day he wrote a note to the princess, asking her to marry 
him. She took it to the king, she asked him to let her marry 
Billesmeu. The king hung his house in black. 
The king was waging a war against the Re’ Mouro Grande. 
Billesmeu said to the princess, “I am going to the war. On my 
return I will shoot off my gun. When you hear it, say, ‘Pedr’ 
Canarvalh’ is coming.’ Say that, whatever they do.” He went 
to the war, thrice he captured the flag. Then he returned. He 
shot off his gun. The princess said, “Pedr’ Canarvalh’ is com- 
ing!” He carried the flag to his own house. The king asked, 
“Why are you so impudent as to take the flag to your own 
house?” He answered, “‘I took it to my house because there is 
no road for me to take to yours. You must put down for me 
layers of gold and silver cloth and po/ine! for my horse to tread 
on.” As he passed along this road, the cloth rolled up behind his 
horse.

Pedr’ built himself a high house (sobraa’) of eighteen stories. 
It was decorated with gold, it was so brilliant it was blinding. He 
gave a feast, to which he invited all. The king himself had to 
come. As they were sitting at the table, Pedr’ put a spoon in the 
king’s pocket. After a while they missed the spoon. The king 
said, “‘Search, and he on whom the spoon is found must be killed, 
were it myself.” They searched, they found the spoon on the 
king. They did not want to kill him. But the king said, ““My 
word is one. I go to the gallows.” 
Pedr’ said, “Send to me the king’s three servants. I bought 
them some time ago.”—‘‘ You bought them!”—“I bought them. 
If you doubt me, pull down their trousers and see my mark.” 
The king was sent to the gallows, and the queen was made a 
servant in Pedr’s house.’ 
(Variant a.) 
There were a man and a woman, they were poor. He was a 
fisherman. Every day he caught enough fish for a living. This 
day he caught no fish. He felt all upset, he wound up his line to 
go home. Then he started back, he threw his line into the sea 
again. He saw a shark. The shark said to him, “If I give you 
fish, will you give me what you find in your house?”—‘Yes, I 
will give you whatever I find in the house.” He started to fish, he 
caught so many fish he had to leave some on the rocks. When he 
reached home, he found that his wife had given birth to a boy. 
He said to his wife that he had made a contract with the shark to 
give him whatever he found at home. This baby was the only 
thing he found. He wrapped up the baby in a little cloth, he 
took it to the shark. Shark said to him, ‘“‘ You are a man of your 
word.” : 
He took the child, he dived down with him to a place of enchant- 
ment. Shark put him in a room of copper, everything in the 
room was of copper. Shark left him. He broke everything in 
the room, he went out. He met a copper horse, he began to beat 
it. The horse said to him, “Don’t beat me! In great trouble 
Pll help you.” Shark came back; he said to him, “Why did you 
break all these things? To-morrow I’ll put you in a room of 
silver.” He left him in the room of silver. The boy broke every- 
thing, he went out. He met a horse of silver, he began to beat it.

The horse said to him, “Don’t beat me! In great trouble I’ll help 
you.” The next day Shark put him in a room of gold. He broke 
everything, he went out. He met a horse of gold, he began to 
beat it. The horse said to him, “Don’t beat me! In great 
trouble I'll help you.” He wanted to go home, he called for the 
horses. They bore him through the sea to shore. They said to 
him, ‘We cannot go farther. We belong in the sea. But when 
you want us, call us. Don’t tell any one your name is Jonsinh’. 
Say you are named Crenc Billesmeu.” 
He went on through mountains and ravines. He had on a 
dress of gold. He met a shepherd, he asked him to exchange his 
clothes for his of gold. He went, went, went, until he came to the 
courtyard of the king. There was a dog that was bad-tempered 
with everybody, but with him he made friends. Then the young~ 
est princess led him from the court into the kitchen, and gave 
him food. Whenever she carried him in a meal, she would ask 
him, ‘‘Who are you? What is your name?”—‘‘My name is 
Crenc Billesmeu.” One feast day the king went to church, he 
took all his family except his youngest daughter. She staid at 
home because of Billesmeu. When he raised his cap, the princess 
saw his golden hair. The next feast day the princess asked him 
to gotochurch. He answered, “No, I will not go, but do you go.” 
After they had all gone, he called his horse of copper. ‘‘To-day 
is the day for you to help me. Dress me in copper, bear me to 
church.” When he reached the church, he went in, everybody 
turned to look at him, even the priest stopped saying mass. After 
mass he went out, he jumped on his horse. The horse rode into 
the air with him, they disappeared from sight. When he reached 
the king’s house; he dismissed the horse, he put on his old clothes, 
he put on his cap, he sat down where they had left him. The 
princess said to him, “You should have gone to church to-day. 
We saw a man, the handsomest man there is.” The next feast 
day the princess asked him to go with them to church, again he 
declined. After they had gone, he called his horse of silver. 
““To-day is the day for you to help me. I want you to dress me 
all in silver and bear me to church.” Again all the people in 
church marvelled at the stranger. They started to fasten the 
horse with a heavy chain, but it broke it, it rose into the air. 
On the next feast day he called for his horse of gold. ‘To-day is 
the day for you to help me. Dress me all in gold and bear me to 
church.” When the people started to catch his horse, he said to
-P-A-G-E-196

them, “Hold it if you like, but let me mount uponit.” The horse 
rose into the air, it disappeared. 
The princess said to him, “It is you, Crenc Billesmeu; you have 
been fooling me.” The princess told the king that she wanted 
to marry Crenc Billesmeu. The king, in a temper, said to her, 
“Crenc Billesmeu is poor and is good for nothing.” But the 
princess insisted, so the king sent to call the priest to come to 
marry them. Then he said they were not to live with him; 
Billesmeu had to go out to earn his living. As soon as Billesmeu 
heard what he said, he dragged the princess away with him. 
They went to a plain on a road by the side of a mountain. They 
sat down in the shade of a tree. The princess was tired. She 
put her head in his lap, she went to sleep. He said, “My horse 
of copper, my horse of silver, my horse of gold, build me a palace 
of three stories, the first of copper, the second of silver, the third 
of gold. Turn the chickens, turkeys, geese, into pure gold, 
servants into gold, quail and even their droppings into gold.” 
The princes who were betrothed to the other daughters of the 
king were out hunting in the mountains. They saw some quail, 
they went after them. The quail flew down into the plain. The 
princes looked down, they saw a palace and all the birds. They 
went down to buy a brace of quail. They met a servant of copper. 
They raised their hats and asked him if he could not sell them a 
brace of quail. ‘“‘I may not, lama servant. Go on to the other 
floor above.” There another servant sent them to the other floor 
above. There a servant of gold took them into the hall, where 
the princess sat with Jonsinh’ on chairs of gold and diamonds. 
They gave them a brace of quail to take to the king. When they 
reached the king’s house, they told him that they had caught the 
quail in the mountains. The king was much pleased, he began to 
play with the quail. 
Jonsinh’ said to his wife that they would visit the king in a 
carriage with three horses,— a copper horse, a silver horse, a gold 
horse. At every step they took, music played. When they 
arrived at the king’s house, every one marvelled at their fineness. 
The king summoned them in. To entertain them he presented 
them with the quail. He told them that the princes caught 
them in the mountains. Jonsinh’ said to him, “Bring in the 
princes. Put them under the hoof of my horse of gold. He will 
tell where they got the quail.” The horse wrote on their backs, 
“Crenc Billesmeu sent the king a present of these quail.” The

men jumped through the windows. They smashed into bits. 
Jonsinh’ invited the royal family to his palace. The king was so 
overcome (?) that he refused to enter. Jonsinh’ said to him, 
“Come in! This is my house and the house of your daughter.” 
The king liked the magnificence so much that he never went back 
to his palace. 
56. GOOD MARIA AND BAD MARIA. 
There was a married man whose wife died and left a daughter 
called Maria. Maria had a cow she understood. There was a 
widow 2 who had a daughter also named Maria. The widower’s 
daughter used to go to the widow’s house, and the widow gave her 
bread and molasses (pa’ e mél). She said to Maria, “‘ Maria, when 
you go home, ask your father to marry me.” Maria’s father said, 
“T am not going to marry her. To-day she gives you bread and 
molasses, to-morrow she’ll give you bread and gall [pa’ e fel].”’ § 
Maria insisted, he finally married the widow. The first night 
after the wedding she let Maria sleep in a bed; the second night 
she made her sleep on a chest, the third night on the floor. Then 
she made her cook for them. Maria cried and went to her father. 
He said, “I can’t do anything. I told you she gave you bread 
and molasses, but later she’d give you bread and gall.” Maria 
went to her cow. She said, “They give me more work than I can 
do.” The cow said to her, “Undertake any work they give you. 
T’'ll do it for you.” So Maria took all her work to her cow. Then 
her step-sister went and smelled the cow’s tail, and thereby knew 
that it was the cow that was doing Maria’s work. The step- 
mother pretended to fall sick. She sent for the said’. She told 
her husband the said’ said that the liver of Maria’s cow was her 
only remedy. He called Maria. “Maria, will you give me your

cow to kill, to get the liver to cure your step-mother?”—“ Yes,” 
said Maria. She went to the cow and sat down and cried. . The 
cow said, ‘‘Maria, you are going to let them kill me. Ask them 
to give you the tripe to clean.” They killed the cow, and Maria 
took the tripe to the river to wash. The river took a piece away 
from her. She was afraid her step-mother would whip her, and 
she decided to run away from home. She met a donkey full of 
sores (leprosy). ‘Donkey, what are you doing here?” The 
donkey answered, “Come here. I’m thirsty. I can’t get rid of 
these flies to get water.” She carried water in her hands and 
washed the sores, and wiped them with her shawl (galan).1 She 
went on, and she met a man with his head set backwards on his 
neck. He asked, ‘Maria, when you go home, what are you 
going to say you saw?”’—“Nothing, only a man standing.” — 
“God go with you! [Deus companha cu b6!\” She went on, and 
she met a man who had taken the skin off his leg to make a bag 
(barquinh’). “Maria, when you go home, what are you going 
to say you saw?”—“Nothing, only a man with a bag getting 
water.”— “God go with you!” She went on, and she met a 
woman who had taken off her head to make a tub to wash clothes. 
“Maria, when you go home, what are you going to say you saw?” 
—Nothing, only a woman washing clothes.”—“God go with 
you!” She went on, and entered the house of three fairies (fad’s). 
There was nobody at home, and the house was dirty. Maria 
cleaned up, the meat she found hanging up she put into a pot 
with some manioc, and then she sat down behind the door. The 
first fairy to come in and see everything in order said, “Oh, who- 
ever has done me this great favor, God grant that whenever she 
laughs the rain may fall, whenever she smiles the weather may 
thicken!” ... The second fairy came in, and said, “God grant 
that, whoever has done me this great favor, a gold star may grow 
on her head!””... The third fairy came in, and said, ‘God grant 
that, whoever has done me this great favor, when she combs her 
hair, diamonds may drop down!” They turned round and saw 
her behind the door. “Come eat!” they said. ‘‘No,” said she. 
They said, “On your way you’ll find a nest with three eggs,— 
two big, one small. Take the small egg, leave the big. What- 
ever is in that small egg is for you. To get out what is in it,

knock it three times on a stone. Knock it again three times to 
send into it what has come out of it.” Maria got the egg. She 
went to the river where she left the tripe and picked it up. The 
rooster crowed, “Rich Maria, rich Maria! [Maria ric’, Maria 
ric!) Her step-sister cried out, ““No, Maria is ruined.” When 
she reached home, Maria started to comb her hair, and out 
dropped diamonds and brilliants. She tied up her head with her 
kerchief (/en¢’) to keep them from dropping out, and she covered 
her golden star with her kerchief. When they talked to her, 
she smiled, and the clouds gathered. They went on talking; she 
laughed, and the rain fell. 
The other Maria had a cow too, a mere brute. She killed it, 
she took the tripe to the river. The river would not take it from 
her. She said, ““You won’t take my tripe? Then I’ll throw it 
into you.” She went on, and she met the donkey. “Donkey, 
what are you doing here?”—“‘Come here. I’m thirsty. I can’t 
get rid of these flies to get water.” With her stick she beat the 
donkey; and she rubbed a rough stone into his sores; she said, 
“This is the water I give you to drink.”— “May the Devil go 
with you!” She went on, and she met the man with the skin off 
his leg for a bag. “Maria, when you go home, what are you 
going to say you saw?”— ‘‘A dirty man. That is not a thing to 
carry water in.”—‘‘The Devil go with you!” She went on, and 
she met the woman with her head off. “Maria, when you go 
home, what are you going to say you saw?”—“A dirty woman 
I saw take her head off to wash clothes in.” —“‘The Devil go with 
you!” She went on to the house of the fairies. It was nice and 
clean, but she made it dirty. She cooked the meat and manioc, 
she ate all she wanted, she soiled the rest. The first fairy came in; 
she said, “Whoever has done me this bad turn, may a donkey’s 
tail grow on her forehead!” The second fairy came in; she said, 
“Whoever has done me this bad turn, when she smiles, may a 
strong wind blow! when she laughs, may a tempest uproot all the 
trees on shore and wreck all the ships at sea!” The third fairy 
came in; she said, “Whoever has done me this bad turn, when 
she combs her hair, may lice [pio/h’] and bedbugs [purseved] and 
pixeling drop out of it!” They said, “On your way you'll find a 
nest with three eggs,— two big, one small. Take the small egg, 
leave the big. Whatever is in that small egg is for you. To get 
out what is in it, knock it three times on a stone. Knock it again 
three times to send into it what has come out of it.” When she

found the nest, she said, ‘“‘Oh, I’d be a fool to take the small egg. 
T’m going to take the big eggs.” She knocked three times on the 
stone, and nothing came out. Then she smashed them on the 
stones, and out came little devils (diabinh’), more than a hun- 
dred. The rooster crowed, ‘‘ Maria is ruined! [Maria sta ruid’]” 
—‘Husband, did you hear the rooster crow, ‘Maria is rich’?”— 
“No, I heard it crow, ‘Maria is ruined!’” She asked Maria, 
“Where have you been?” Maria smiled, and the wind began to 
blow. She laughed, and a tempest raged. She tried to comb 
her hair, and down dropped lice and bedbugs and pixeling. 
When she pulled off her kerchief, there was the donkey’s tail to 
be seen. Her mother tried to trim it; but the more she cut, the 
longer it grew.! 
They were going to church. The woman ordered her step- 
daughter to stay at home in the kitchen. Maria said to her egg, 
“Maria Condon, through the virtue God gives you, send me a 
dress, the prettiest dress in the world, and give me a face none 
will recognize!” Maria Condon gave her a dress of white silk, 
‘a white hat, and a pair of white shoes.2 When she stepped into 
the church, all turned round to gaze at her. Even the priest 
stopped saying mass. When they started to sing the dite misa 
est, she disappeared. As she went out, she dropped one of her 
white shoes. The king picked it up. He proclaimed (toca ban’) 
that all were to come to the palace. Whomever the shoe fitted 
he would marry. The woman sent her own daughter; but the 
shoe did not cover even her ear. “I have here a cat in the ashes 
[gato burralheiro|, there’s no need to send her,” said the woman.‘ 
1 Variant: Rosa, the step-sister, is ugly; her mouth is like the trunk of an elephant. 
(San Anton.) (Aside from this reference, the whole episode of the adventures of the two 
girls is dropped out.) 
2 Variant: Maria has three dresses given her by her godmother. One is the color of 
the sky (co’r de céo); one, the color of the moon (co’r de Jua); one, the color of the sea 
(cor de mar). She keeps them all in a nutshell, Maria has also a little stick (varinha 
condon). She knocks with the stick, and says, “Varinha Condon, by the virtue God gives 
you [par vertude que Deus da bé], take me to the dance, and take me home before they 
come back.” (They had left her to sit in the ashes in the kitchen.) (San Anton.) 
3 Variant: Maria is the handsomest and best-dressed woman at the dance. The prince 
says, “This is my wife, 1 am going to marry her.” Her step-mother is envious, and wants 
to take Rosa home. Maria disappears, and they find her asleep in the kitchen. Maria 
goes similarly to two more dances. Meanwhile, for love of her, the prince falls sick. 
At the third dance the king has placed three guards of soldiers, but Maria runs through 
them ali, The prince cannot hold her, he merely pulls off one of her slippers, (San 
Anton.) 
‘ Variant: Ringing the bell of his citadel (sino na baluarte), the king summons all to 
come. If any one leaves even a child at home, his head will be cut off. Maria is left 
at home, because, says her step-mother, she has nothing to wear. “I don’t care if she is

But Maria did go, and the shoe fitted her. The king married her. 
Whial "There was a grand feast.? 
(Variant a.) 
There was a widower who had a daughter named Maria. 
His house stood alone. The nearest house was fifteen or twenty 
miles away. In it lived a widow who also had a daughter Maria. 
Maria’s father charged her every day not to let the fire go out. 
Maria said, “I’ve seen nobody since I’ve lived here. I'll let 
the fire go out, so I shall have to go get fire, and then I’ll see 
somebody.”” Next day, when her father went out, she went to 
the house of the widow to get fire. The woman treated her well. 
She told her father about her visit, and she asked him to marry 
the widow. The man said, “To-day she treats you well; after I 
married her, she would treat you ill.”—-“Not so,” said Maria, 
“that woman would never mistreat me.” The man married the 
widow. The very day of the wedding the woman gave Maria a 
coche de porc’ for her to drink from, and a coche de galinha to eat 
out of. She wept. Her mother had left her a little cow. Next 
day the woman gave her a basket of cotton to spin, and to have 
the cloth ready the following day. Maria cried and went to the 
cow. The cow asked, “Maria, why do you cry?”—“I cry be- 
cause my step-mother has given me a basket of cotton to spin 
into thread by to-morrow morning.’’—‘‘Don’t cry! Throw the 
cotton down here; and when you come to-morrow morning, 
you will find the thread.” When Maria took the thread to her 
step-mother, she knew it was the work of the little cow. She lay 
down and played sick. When her husband came home, she told 
buried in ashes,” says the king, “bring her here, else I will cut off your head and your 
wife’s head.” Maria refuses to go. Her father weeps, and begs her to go and save him 
for the sake of her mother’s ashes (pa’ cinsa di bu mae). She refuses. Three times the 
king sends for her,— colonel and major and soldiers. The third time she agrees to go if 
the king spreads out from her door to his a carpet of silk embroidered with diamonds. 
(San Anton.) : 
1 Variant: Maria talks with her varinka condon. She puts on the dress she wore the 
last night of the dance. She rides as slowly as she can between the soldiers drawn up to 
meet her. There stands the prince holding the slipper. When Maria arrives, the slipper 
jumps out of the hand of the prince and on to Maria’s foot. The prince takes her to 
the church, and the bells ring so loud they make everybody deaf. (San Anton.) 
2 Variant: Maria’s father and step-mother and step-sister go crazy. People have to 
hold them to keep them from suicide.... At the feast Rosa stays alone in the corner, 
spitting with temper at every one who speaks to her. Every time Maria breathes, sweet- 
smelling roses drop. The prince puts the roses in his pocket, so that no other can get them. 
The feast over, people Jook around, and see that the step-mother has dried up from envy 
into a’stick of wood. “What do you want done with her?” asks the king of Maria. 
“Bury her body in the pig-pen [chigue de porc’].” (San Anton.)

him she was sick, but that the insides of the cow would cure her. 
Maria went to her cow, crying. The cow asked, “What are you 
crying about?” Maria refused to tell. The cow said, “You 
don’t want to tell me; but I know they are going to kill me. 
Don’t cry! When they kill me, you’ll come into a fortune.” 
They killed the cow. The step-mother gave the santa folk’ to 
Maria to wash. “Don’t lose any of it; if you do, you must go 
after it,” she said. As Maria was washing it, a tongue of water 
bore it away. Her step-mother said, “You must get it back, 
whether it is in heaven or earth.” Maria started forth. The 
first creature she met was a sow with young. She said, “O sow! 
have you seen the santa folh’ the tongue of water bore from me?” — 
“Yes,” said the sow; “but first climb up into that fig-tree and 
throw figs down to my little ones, then I'll tell you about it.” 
Maria threw down the figs. The sow said, “Go a little farther, 
and you'll meet a hen with chickens. She’ll tell you about it.” 
Maria went on, she met the hen. The hen said, “First go to the 
brook to dig worms for me and my chickens, then J’ll tell you 
about it.” She dug the worms; the hen said, “Go a little farther, 
and you'll meet a donkey. He will tell you about it.” She 
went on, she met the donkey. The donkey was covered with 
sores. He said, “First get some hay for me, then I’ll tell you 
about it.” She got some hay; the donkey said, “Go into that 
house over there, in it you'll find those to tell you about it.” 
The house belonged to seven robbers (isfloradors). She entered 
the house, she put it in order, then she took a glass of water and 
sat down behind the door. Within a quarter of an hour the 
robbers arrived, and found all the housework done. They said, 
“Whoever has done this work for us, may every serviceable 
animal be hers, may all the money she needs be hers! Whenever 
she combs her hair, may golden tainha fall from it! Whenever 
she laughs, may the sun shine! Whenever she weeps, may the 
rain fall!” They also gave her a basket of eggs, and told her to 
break them on her way. Whatever she saw after she broke an 
egg would be hers. The first egg she broke, she saw cows and 
horses, sheep and goats. The more she broke, the richer she grew. 
At midnight she neared home. The rooster crowed, “Cocolay! 
Maria rich! [Maria ric’!)” The woman was awake, the man 
asleep. She waked him up; she said, “Listen to the rooster 
crowing, ‘Cocolay, Maria donkey-dung! [4urdung!!” He waked 
up, he listened; he said, “No, wife, the rooster is crowing, ‘Coco-
-P-A-G-E-203

lay, Maria rich!’”’—‘‘No, no, ‘Maria donkey-dung!’” When 
Maria came in, the yard could not hold all the animals follow- 
ing her. She thought her step-mother was going to maltreat 
her, she began to cry. Then rain fell, and the water ran every- 
where. Her father said, ““O Maria, my daughter! don’t cry, 
laugh!” She laughed, and the sun shone. She combed her hair, 
her step-mother saw money falling from it. The woman became 
excited, she called her own daughter. She had a cow named 
Pardinia. The woman said, “Bring Pardinia here, kill her, take 
out the santa folh’ to wash, so you too can get rich.” They split 
open Pardinia, they took out the santa folh’. When the girl 
came to the water, she threw it in. On her return home, her 
mother said to her, ““You must find it again, whether it is in 
heaven or earth.” She started out, she met the sow and her 
young. Instead of throwing figs down to them, she cut off the 
heads of all the little pigs. In the same way, when she met the 
hen and her chickens, she killed all the chickens. When she met 
the donkey, she got a stick of cari¢’ and picked open all the 
donkey’s sores. Into the house of the robbers she took back all 
the refuse Maria had cleaned out. When the robbers saw this, 
one of them said, “Whoever has done this, may dragons [dicha 
fera\ follow her wherever she goes!” Another robber said, 
“Whoever has done this, may wild wolves and wild goats and all 
the wild animals follow her!” Another said, “‘ Whoever has done 
this, whenever she cries, may a drought fall!” Another said, 
“Whoever has done this, when she laughs, may donkey-dung fall 
on the ground!”” They gave her a basket of rotten eggs. As they 
broke on her way, all kinds of wild animals followed her. At 
midnight, as she neared home, the rooster crowed, “Cocolay, 
Maria donkey-dung!” Her mother was awake, waiting for her. 
She called to her husband, “Wake up, the rooster is crowing, 
‘Cocolay, Maria rich!”—‘“No, wife, the rooster is crowing, 
‘Cocolay, Maria donkey-dung!’” The people were overcome 
to see all the wild animals. Her mother asked her to cry. She 
cried, and a drought set in. She laughed, and donkey-dung fell. 
She combed her hair, and from it fell chicken-droppings. Maria 
Rich became the mistress; and Maria Donkey-Dung, the servant. 
Whenever they sent her to wash the dishes, the dung dropped 
off her.

574 THE JEALOUS HUSBAND: THE BOY AND HIS poc. 
There was a man who was a jealous man. He said he would 
marry no woman any man had ever seen. He stole a girl two 
years old, he shut her up in a house with seven rooms, with seven 
doors, with seven locks. When she was sixteen, he summoned 
a priest to marry them. Nobody else was present. One day he 
met one of his compadres. “Are you married?” asked the com- 
padre. ‘Yes, 1 am married.”—“ Who is your wife?””—“A woman 
nobody knows.”—“ You fool yourself. You are married to the 
lowest woman in the world.”—“‘I am certain nobody knows my 
wife.’—“‘Stay away from home one week, and I will tell you all 
the marks on your wife.” The man went to an old woman. He 
said, “I have a bet I don’t know how to win. In a week I must 
tell my compadre all the marks on his wife.” The old woman 
said, ‘“Give me one hundred dollars and a bag of milk. I'll find 
out for you all the marks she bears.” She took the bag of milk, 
and she went to the compadre’s house to sell it. As she poured 
the milk into a pitcher, she let it run over. The servant went in 
to get a mop to mop it up. Then the old woman went into the 
wife’s room, where she lay asleep. The girl had a mark of hair 
wound seven times around her body at the navel. The old woman 
saw this mark, she stole a ring given the girl by her husband. She 
cut off a piece of the girl’s dress. At the end of the week the man 
said to his compadre, “I told you your wife was worthless. Here 
is the proof. Here is a piece of her dress.”—‘That is nothing. 
Others may have bought a piece of the same goods I bought.”— 
“Your wife has a mark around the belly.”—‘That is nothing. 
Others may have a like birth-mark.””—“‘Here is her ring.”-—“ Yes, 
now I believe you,” said the husband. He went home; he said 
to his wife, “To-morrow prepare a feast. I am going to invite 
here all the men of the city.”—‘‘How is this?” asked the girl. 
“Since my birth I’ve seen no man but you. Now to-morrow I 
have to face all the men of the city at once!” The men came and 
ate. They asked fora speech. The girl said, “All I know is that 
I was happily married. To-day I am not happily married. 
Why, I do not know.” Her husband said, “It is because I have 
found a thieving rat in my garden.” His compadre spoke up: 
“T passed by your garden, but not a flower did I touch.” Never-

theless the husband was so jealous, that he said to his wife after 
they had all left, “I am going to kill you.” She was pregnant. 
She said, “Do not kill me, I beg! Put me into a glass casket and 
throw me into the sea. If I owe, Pll pay. If I don’t owe, I 
won’t pay.” 
The glass casket floated until it went ashore. In that place 
there lived only wild animals. A wild goat came along, it broke 
open the casket, it dragged the girl by her skirt to a cave. The 
goat let the girl milk her every day until the baby was born. 
For sixteen years they lived there. One day the boy saw a ship 
at sea. He signalled to it with his mother’s skirt. The captain 
sent a boat ashore, the boy went in it to the ship. He said to his 
mother, “Do you stay here. Some day I'll return for you.” 
The boy was born with the same mark as his mother. In that 
mark he had the strength of seventeen men. When the captain 
ordered the anchor up, the youth sprang forward and pulled it 
up unaided. The captain was frightened. After six months the 
captain was so afraid of him that he turned the ship over to him. 
The boy returned for his mother. On board, his mother began to 
weep for the goat they had left behind. A little white dove flew 
on board, God had sent it to keep her company.. When they 
made land, the youth set out to look for a house for his mother to 
live in while he was seeking his fortune at sea. He found an 
empty house. A man told him that every one who entered this 
house died. “If you can sleep there until morning, the house is 
yours.” [Here follows the tale of the falling half-man.] 
He installed his mother in this house, cautioning her not to let 
anything come up through the trap-door [where he had dropped 
the giant]. The woman heard a groan. She had the injured 
giant brought up, she fed him and gave him wine to drink. He 
revived. He said, “I have nothing to give you. I could marry 
you, but your son is too powerful. He is blessed of God. At 
twelve o’clock he will be home.’ The giant was a diviner. 
“Act sick, and tell him only the fat of Lion-of-the-Forest [Leon 
di Mat’] will cure you.” A little dog belonging to the boy heard 
all this. He ran off to the dock. There the boy found him and 
played with him. The boy said, “O my little dog! I know you 
have something to tell me, if only you could speak.” At twelve 
the boy went home. His mother said to him,, “I am sick, and 
only the fat of Lion-of-the-Forest will cure me.” As the boy 
rode along, he met an old man (God). The old man said, “Jon,
-P-A-G-E-206
Folk-Lore from the Cape Verde Islands. 179 
blessed of God, where are you going?”—“‘I am going to take the 
fat of Lion-of-the-Forest to cure my sick mother.”—‘Go, and 
under that tree yonder you will find a lion. If he lies with his 
eyes open, you can kill him. If his eyes are shut, run from him 
as fast as you can.” The lion had his eyes open. The boy 
speared him with his lance. The lion cried, “O false one! why 
did you not let me know you wanted to fight?” The boy again 
met the old man. The old man said, “Let me see the fat!” 
He took the fat, and in its place put another piece of fat. The 
boy took it to his mother. She recovered, and he returned to 
his vessel. 
The giant said, ““He will come home to-morrow at twelve. 
Act sick, and tell him only the water of Cheforis will cure you.” 
The little dog heard this, he ran down to the dock. His master 
played with him; he said, “O my little dog! I know you have 
something to tell me, if only you could speak.” At twelve he 
went home. His mother said, “I am sick, and only the water of 
Cheforis will cure me.” He started to fetch it. The old man saw 
him three miles off. “Jon, blessed of God, where are you going?” 
—‘T am going to fetch water from Cheforis to cure my sick 
mother.” The old man gave him a bottle. “At the spring of 
Cheforis there are rocks which open and shut. Run your horse 
through these rocks as fast as you can.” The boy ran his horse 
through the rocks; they closed, and cut off the tail of his horse. 
He met the old man. “Let me see your bottle of water!” The 
old man took the bottle and replaced it with another. The boy 
took the bottle home and cured his mother. 
The giant said to the woman, “Your son is blessed of God. 
He has around his middle a mark of hair. There lies his strength. 
If you cut it, I shall be able to kill him myself. When he comes 
home and goes to sleep, cut the hair.” The little dog ran down 
to the dock and played with his master. ‘““O my little dog! I 
know you have something to tell me, if only you could speak.” 
After he went home, his mother drew him to her, he put his head 
in her lap, he went to sleep. She cut the hair. He lost his 
strength. The giant appeared. The boy said to him, “All I ask 
of you is, after you split me in two, that you fasten me to my horse 
and then turn him loose.” The horse knew only one road, the 
road they had followed to get the fat of Lion-of-the-Forest and 
the water of Cheforis. ‘The old man saw the horse three miles off. 
“Jon, blessed of God, see to what your good heart has brought

you!” He stopped the horse, he rubbed the boy with two pieces 
of the fat of Lion-of-the-Forest, he washed him with the water 
of Cheforis. He came back to life. “Jon, what do you desire?” 
—‘T desire my strength back.” God whistled for the little dog. 
“Little dog, go get the hair from his mother. She has it in her 
bosom.” The little dog ran home, he played with the woman, 
he stuck his nose inside her bosom, he took the hair, he ran off 
with it to God. God restored it to the boy. His old strength 
returned, and more. He said, “It is too much, cut it down.” 
He went home. He encountered the giant. “Kill me,” said the 
giant, “and do by me what J did by you.” He split the giant in 
two, he fastened him to a horse. On that horse that giant is still 
wandering about the world. 
For a son to kill his mother is not right. So the boy buried his 
mother to her neck in the cellar. There he intended to feed her 
until she died. Thus he would not have to kill her with his own 
hands. One day, when he was in the city, he met a man who 
recognized him as his son. The boy told his father how he was 
keeping his mother. His father went home with him, he recog- 
nized his wife. He told his son to take her out. They are all 
alive still, and well. 
58. THE GIRL WITHOUT HANDS, BREASTS, OR EYES.! 
There was a man had a daughter. She made asylums for the 
poor. Her father did not know about it until her godfather told 
him. ‘Soon you will be a poor man,” said his compadre, “‘seeing 
how your daughter is spending your fortune.” Six months of the 
year the man spent in town with his daughter; the other six, on 
his estates in the country. He invited his daughter to go with 
him into the country, he showed her about his estates.. In the 
last was a pine-wood. Here he tied the girl to a pine-tree. He 
cut her hands off at the wrist, he cut off her breasts and put out 
her eyes. He left her. 
This place was near a king’s house. The king had a dog, and 
they began to notice that the dog was falling off. The king 
asked the keeper if he cut his rations. The keeper answered, 
“T give him the regular rations; but he runs off with them some- 
where, I don’t know where.” ‘The king set a man to watch the

dog. Every day the dog ran through the wood and took food to 
the girl and licked her wounds. They told the king; he went to 
the girl, he unbound her, he brought her to the palace. He told 
his mother he was going to marry this girl. His mother said, 
“Tt is disgraceful to marry a girl without hands or breasts or eyes.”” 
The king answered, “‘This is my wife.”’ 
There was a war being waged, and the king had to go to it. 
After he went, his wife gave birth to twins. The king’s mother 
wrote to him about it, she said that the children were the hand- 
somest in the country. The letter-bearer stopped at a hostelry 
(stalaje) where they} gave him opeo [opium?] to smoke, took out 
his letter and read it, and changed it to read that the two children 
were two puppies. The bearer went on his way, he gave the 
letter to the king. The king wrote back that they were to treat 
the dogs like children. On his return journey, the bearer stopped 
at the same hostelry; and again they read the letter, and changed 
it to read that mother and children should be cast out of the palace, 
lest the king return and destroy it. When the king’s mother 
received this letter, she felt sad; but she had to obey the king’s 
word. Her daughter-in-law said, “Make me two baskets to 
hang on my shoulders, and I will go. It is my destiny.” She 
went out before dawn with the babies in the baskets. As she 
went, she wondered if she could find water for the babies to drink. 
She felt the air cooler, then she felt water around her feet. She 
reached down to it with her left arm. Then she felt her hand 
grow, and that she could grasp with her fingers. She said to 
herself, “If God is good enough to give me back my left hand, he 
may give me my right hand.” She reached down, out grew her 
right hand. ‘Would that I could have milk for my babies!” 
she said, and she sprinkled water on her chest. Her breasts grew 
out, and without waiting to restore her eyesight she began to 
nurse the babies. After she nursed them, she bathed her eyes 
and she saw. 
She went on, she reached the city of her birth. Her father was 
dead. To his house all strangers coming into the city were sent. 
The morning after their arrival they were always found dead. 
The woman and her babies were sent to the house. At midnight . 
she heard a voice asking her for pardon. It was the voice of her 
father. He had become a demon; it was he who killed the 
strangers. His daughter said she would pardon him, and that

he must let people know her story. With a tongue of fire he 
burned into the floor the story of what he had done to his daughter. 
““Now I can go to rest,” said he. In the morning they came to 
the house as usual, the priest and the town officials, to take out 
the dead. They were surprised to find her alive. They called 
together the City Council to read the writing. The city gave her 
all her father’s property. She was his only child. She came into 
possession of the house at eleven o’clock. At twelve she had given 
an order that the house was to be an asylum again for the poor 
and for strangers. 
When the king returned home, he asked for his wife. His 
mother showed him the letter. He set off at once to find his wife. 
He travelled so long, that his clothes wore out, his beard reached 
to his waist, his hair to his shoulders. Finally he came to the city 
of his wife. He was so low in his estate, that he went to the asy- 
lum. In it were twelve inmates. They argued about taking him 
in. Some said their patroness would object; others, that she was 
a good woman and would not object. They decided to take him 
in, each to give him a spoonful out of his plate. She visited the 
asylum, she saw the new-comer, she ordered that he be fed. It 
was noticeable that her children, now growing up, took to the 
new-comer, and followed him about. 
One day he said to her that her ways were like those of his 
wife, but he knew that she could not be his wife, because his wife 
had no hands or breasts or eyes. Then she knew that he was 
her husband. All her property in that place she left to the poor, 
she returned with the king to his country to be queen. 
59. COMPADRE DEATH. 
There was a woman had a child. She made him a danco d’ory.2 
When he became a man, nobody could play against him. They 
sent a man from Lisbon to play against him. They played,

2 Ory is the name of the nut which is used as a counter. It is brown and whitish, some- 
what smaller and smoother than a horse-chestnut. Four counters are dropped into each 
of the twelve holes or pockets of the danco. The danco is about two feet long, made out 
of the wood of a fig-tree. The pockets in two rows, six to a row, are about two inches 
deep; the whole Zanco, about three. At each end there is also a pocket for counters. 
00000 Six pockets belong to each of the two players, each player sitting be- 
hind his own row of pockets. Scoring is by making a pocket in the 
row of the opponent contain two or three counters. The two or three counters are then

played, played; he won by one grain of ory. He put his danco 
d ory under his arm, he started out to look for some one to play 
with him. He met an old man. The old man said to him, “Do 
you know how to play?”—‘‘A little.”—‘ Well, let us sit down 
here and play.” They played, and the boy won. He kept on 
winning. Then the old man began to win. He won every game. 
Finally the boy said to him, “I am hungry, I must look for 
something to eat.” The old man said to him, “You don’t need 
to look for anything to eat. I'll give you something to eat.” He 
pulled off a button, he gave it to the boy, the boy sucked it until 
he had enough. They played again. The old man said to him, 
“What do you want me to give you?”—“One grain of ory, so 
I win against any. one who plays with me.” The old man asked 
him, “Are you not seeking the salvation of your soul?”—‘No, 
I save my soul through my hand.” The old man asked, “What 
more do you want?”—“I want a seat from which, when J sit, 
I need never get up. I want an orange-tree in front of my house 
on which, if any one climbs, he must stay until I let him come 
down. I want anything I speak to to answer me.” 
The boy went to a house to pass the night where there were 
three girls. The man of the house said that two of the girls were 
very flighty, but the third girl was a nice quiet girl. The third 
girl was dumb. But in accordance with his gift, when he spoke 
to her, she answered him. The girl told him she had never been 
out of the house. He married her. They were married seven 
years, they had no children. He went to the said’. The said’ 
said to him, “When you go home, climb the orange-tree in front 
of your house, take the topmost orange, which faces where the 
taken up to the credit of the player. They may be dropped into one of the two large 
pockets at the end of the Janco, or retained in the hand. When all the counters are 
taken up, the player who holds the greater number scores one. The game is nine. 
If the player who is behind in the score scores twice in succession, he thereby wipes off 
his opponent’s score. In dropping the counter, a player must pick up all the counters 
resting in the pocket he selects, he being free to select only from his own row. He must 
then drop one counter into every pocket successively, beginning from the pocket next the 
one from which he takes up the counters, and passing from left to right.— We have here 
the Arabian game which is found throughout Africa (Culin, 595-607; see, too, Tre- 
mearne, 59). From notes made by Mr, Culin since the publication of his article, and 
kindly furnished me, it appears that in Senegambia the game is called ooree, and is 
played with forty-eight counters on a board of twelve holes. The Peulhs call the game 
wuri. \t is played by the Foolahs, the Yolofs, and the Mandingo, in the Senegal 
(Schweinfurth, 2:29). The game is called wari by the Timne (Thomas, 65-67). The 
Rev. F. Gardiner, Jr., writes Mr. Culin that under the name of wawee he found the 
game not only in St. Lucia, but in Barbadoes and Martinique. Under the name of 
maukalét the game is played by the Syrians in Boston (JAFL 16 : 139).

sun rises, split it in two, eat half, give half to your wife. After 
that she will become a mother.” 
After the child was born, the father went out, he met the same 
old man. He said to him, “I am married, I have a child.” The 
old man said to him, “Give me the child to be my godchild,”’ 
(The old man was God.) “No, I will not give you the child, 
because you are not just. Some men you make poor; others, 
rich.” He went on, and he met Death. He said to him, “I am 
married, and J have a child.” Death said to him, “Give him to 
me to be my godchild.” —“Yes, I will give him to you, because 
you are just. You kill both the poor and the rich.” 
He made Death his compadre. After a long time, his days 
completed, Death came for him. ‘“‘Good-day, Compadre!”’ said 
Death. ‘I’ve come to get you.”——“‘Good. All I ask of you is 
to let me first eat my breakfast.” Death agreed. After break- 
fast Death said to him, “Hurry now, let us go! I want to take 
you!”’——““O Compadre! let me eat my dinner.” After dinner he 
said, “Well, Compadre, let’s go!” —“‘Yes, let’s go now! the only 
thing is that I’ll keep thinking of that orange-tree. If you get 
me down an orange to take with me, I think I’ll be easy.” When 
Death climbed the tree, he wished him to stay there, and there he 
had to stay. Meanwhile every’ one grew old, nobody died. 
Death’s compadre himself got so old that one day he felt tired of 
living. He called to Death to come down. Death was so eager 
to come down, he passed over his compadre, he did not see him, 
and he went and killed three million people before he came back 
for his compadre. 
Then Death took him with him to heaven. When they came 
to heaven, Lord St. Peter, keeper of the keys of Paradise, came 
to open the door for him. He asked him, ‘‘Who are you?” —“I 
am Little-John.”—“‘What was your life?”—“My life was gam- 
bling.” St. Peter said to him, “Souls for inside, Little-John 
for hell.”” He went to hell, he played, he won all the souls in 
hell. He came, he knocked on the door. Lord St. Peter said 
to him, “Who are you?”—“‘I am Little-John, with all the souls 
that were in hell, even to one with a broken leg.” —“ All the souls 
for inside.” When Lord St. Peter opened the door, Little-John 
began to pull, he sat in the seat of Lord St. Peter. He became a 
saint, there he is to this day.

There was a man, he had a son named Bicentinh’. He went 
about stealing, stealing, stealing. God tired of this stealing. 
He asked Bicentinh’ not to steal any more. Bicentinh’ said to 
him, “I'll stop stealing if you give me what I want. I want you 
to give me a seat from which, when I sit on it, I do not have to 
get up; and that whoever climbs the fig-tree at my door shall have 
to stay in it until I bid him come down; I want never to lose when 
I gamble; and I want to become able to cure every sickness.” 
Bicentinh’ stopped stealing, but his father did not. [Spliced 
in here is the incident of the father caught in the tar-barrel.] 
Bicentinh’ heard that the son of the king was sick. That day 
he was about to die. Death was coming for him. Death was 
standing at the head of the bed. (Death had an agreement with 
Bicentinh’ that when he found him standing at the foot of the bed 
of a sick person, that person might live; when he stood at the 
head of the bed, that person must die.) Bicentinh’ saw Death 
standing at the head of the bed, he turned the bed-foot towards 
him. 
Death said to him, “You have saved this man, but now you’re 
going to pay for it with your own life.” Bicentinh’ said, “Death, 
let me get one fig from my fig-tree before I die.” He started to 
climb the tree. Death said to him, “I'll get it for you.” Death 
climbed up; and Bicentinh’ said, “Death, stay there!” 2 
While Death was up in the fig-tree, nobody died. Two hun- 
dred years passed, three hundred, four hundred. Bicentinh’ be- 
came so old, finally he called Death down. Down came Death, 
he killed him. Bicentinh’ said, “Now I’m dead, I’ll gamble a little 
in hell before I go to heaven.” He sat down to gamble in hell, 
and he won one thousand souls from the Devil. He took these 
souls up to glory with him. He knocked at the door. St. Peter 
asked, “‘Who are you?”—‘“I am Bicentinh’, with one thousand 
souls from hell.” God said to St. Peter, ‘Let in the one thousand 
souls, send Bicentinh’ back to hell.” When Bicentinh’ went back, 
the Devil asked, ‘What do you want?”—“I have come back to

gamble for all the souls in hell.” He won all the souls. He took 
them up to heaven, he knocked at the door. St. Peter asked, 
“Who are you?””—‘‘I am Bicentinh’, with all the souls in hell.” 
St. Peter got up to open the door to the souls, but to send Bicentinh’ 
back to hell. As St. Peter opened the door, Bicentinh’ came in 
under his legs, he took his seat. St. Peter turned to sit down, he 
found Bicentinh’ sitting in his seat. St. Peter said to him, “Get up, 
let me sit down!” But Bicentinh’ would not get up. St. Peter 
complained to God. God said to him, “I cannot help it. That’s 
the contract I made with him.” St. Peter said to Bicentinh’, 
“You stole all over the world, and now you come to heaven to 
steal too.” 
60. ARE MONKEYS PEOPLE?! 
There were two monkeys, husband and wife. They lived in 
the woods. The wife said to the husband, “Don’t you know we 
are people?” —“ Wife, you know well that we are not people.”— 
““Why?”’—“ Because we have a tail.”——‘‘Never mind that! [liter- 
ally, ‘let that be!’] look at our feet and hands and face! They are 
like people’s.” She said, ““We must travel, because a ship at 
anchor never gets freight.” Next day in the morning he took a 
basket of figs, he went to town.2- When he got near, he sat down 
to watch how people went into the town. He went in. The 
children began to shout at him, “‘Macaca! There goes a Ma- 
caca!” He began to run. He dropped the basket. On his 
way he stumbled on a [piece of] bread. He picked it up, he took 
it home. His wife asked him, “How did you get on in town?” — 
“Oh, fine! There is a piece of bread they sent you. Now I know 
that we are people. They want you to go to-morrow.” Next 
day in the morning she filled her basket with figs, she went, she 
stopped at the same place to watch how people went into town. 
Then she went into the city. The children shouted, “There is 
our monkey, the one who was here yesterday!” She said, “This 
is the place where my husband was.” Then the children began 
to tease. They teased, teased, teased. 
At home the young ones were crying. ‘Mamma is late,” 
they said. Their father said to them, “Children, when you smell 
a bad smell, your mother is coming home.” They smelled a bad

smell, they went out to meet her. She was crying. The children 
asked, ‘“What’s the matter with you, mamma?” She answered, 
“What your father told me, I believe now. He knew when he 
said that we were not people.”” When she reached the house, 
her husband said to her, “‘Wife, how did you get on in town?” 
She answered, “‘Now I believe that we are not people. Let us 
move away from here! Let us go to live in the cliffs, where we 
belong! We'll go no more to town.”—“‘Just so! I let you go to 
town to find out for yourself that we are not people.” They left 
the place; they said, “No more city for us.” 
61. THE WORN-OUT ANIMALS.! 
There was a man had a good horse. The horse served him well 
when he was good and strong; but the horse grew old and could 
do nothing. His master turned him loose. He said to him, 
“Go look after yourself.” He went, he met adog. The dog was 
a good watchman; but when he grew old and could not serve his 
master, he [his master] turned him out. He said to him, “Go 
look after yourself.” Horse and Dog told each other how their 
masters had treated them. Horse said to Dog, “Let us go to- 
gether!” They went a little way, they met a cat. Cat said to 
them, “‘I was good and clean inside the house, but I became old 
and helpless, my master told me to go look after myself.” Horse 
and Dog said to Cat, “Come along with us! We are in the same 
position.” -They went on, they met a rooster. Rooster was 
crying. He said to them, ‘“‘When I was young, when I crowed, 
it was one o'clock for sure. I grew old and helpless, I lay abed 
until the sun rose. My master told me to go look out for myself.” 
They said to him, “Come along with us!” 
They went, went, until nightfall. They stopped at a fig-tree to 
sleep. Rooster went up to the top of the fig-tree; Cat, farther 
down, on the branches; Dog, farther down, on the trunk; Horse, 
on the ground under the fig-tree. Rooster saw a light, he told 
Cat. Cat said to him, “Let us tell Dog, and see what he says.” 
Dog said to them, “We better tell Horse. He is the biggest of 
all of us, he knows best what we should do.” Horse said to them, 
“Come, let us go there!” When they arrived, Horse said,

“Dog, mount on my back; Cat, on top of you; and Rooster, on 
top of Cat.” They got up on top. There was a band of robbers 
counting their money. As soon as the robbers caught sight of the 
animals, they ran off. 
There were seven robbers. One of them told the others he 
wanted to go back and see. They advised him not to go, because 
they had never seen such a thing. Nevertheless he went back. 
Meanwhile Cat was lying in the fireplace; Dog, in the middle of 
the house; Horse, by the door; Rooster, up on the roof-beam. 
When the robber came in, he saw the cat’s eyes. He thought 
they were fire, he went to poke it up. Cat jumped on him, and 
scratched his face all over. He ran to the middle of the house. 
Dog caught him in the calf of his leg. He ran for the door. 
Horse kicked him with both [hind-Jlegs. Rooster heard the 
racket. He called out, “Catch him for me! Catch him for me! 
Catch him for me!”! The robber ran, and said to the others, 
“Wait for me to tell you!” They said to him, “We don’t want to © 
hear.” They ran. When they were far away, he said to them, 
“In the fireplace was an impudent woman. She gave me a 
slap such as no woman ever gave me before. When I escaped 
from her, I met an impudent carpenter. He gave me two hacks 
in my calf, he took out a piece of my calf. When I ran to the 
door, I met an impudent Englishman. He gave me two punches, - 
one after the other. But all that was nothing. If the one who 
called out, ‘Catch him for me! Catch him for me!’— if he had 
caught me, he would have killed me for sure.” 
62, THE FALSE DIVINER? 
There were two friends, they were compadres. One told the 
other in fun that he was a diviner, He took the cow of his friend, 
he hid it. Then he passed by the door of his friend, he found him 
sitting down there sad. “‘Compadre, what are you sad about?” — 
“T have reason to be sad. The best thing I own is my cow, now 
I’ve lost her.”—‘“‘Well, you don’t need to be sad. You are my 
friend and compadre, 1 am a diviner. I can tell you where your 
cow is. That’s my business. Go up on that hill, you'll find your

cow tied to a pulgeira.’” The man went, he found his cow; he 
said, “My friend is certainly a diviner.”” Two days later he stole 
a goat from his friend, he hid it in the woods. He passed by the 
door of his friend, he found him sitting down there sad. ‘‘Com- 
padre, what are you sad about?”—“‘Two days ago I lost my cow. 
I found her. Now I have lost my goat.”—-“‘Oh, that is nothing, 
and it won’t cost you anything to find it. Go down to that 
hollow, you'll find your goat tied up there.” He went, he found 
his goat, he was sure his compadre was a diviner. Three days 
later he stole his friend’s donkey, he hid it back of a little hill. 
He passed by his friend’s house, he found him sitting down there 
sad. “Compadre, what are you sad about?”—“A few days ago I 
lost my cow, then my goat, now I have lost my donkey. It’s too 
much to ask you to find it.”—“But I can tell you where your 
donkey is,” and he told him. 
After he found his donkey, he passed by the king’s house. The 
king had just lost six thousand conte. He said to the king, “I 
have a compadre who can tell you where to find that money.” 
The king said to him, “Bring him here. If he tells me, I will give 
you a lot of money. If he does not tell me, I will send you both 
to the gallows.”! When the diviner arrived, he asked the king 
to give him and his compadre a room for six days. He was sure 
they were going to the gallows, because he did not know where the 
money was. The king ordered the servant to take the men some- 
thing to eat. When the servant went in, the diviner was so upset, 
that he was counting the days he had still to live. He looked at 
the servant; he said, ‘“‘O God! one from six leaves five!” The 
next day another servant went in. The diviner looked up and 
said, ““O God! two from six leaves four!” All this time he was 
awfully worried, but his compadre was cheerful and confident. 
The third day another servant went in. He looked up and said, 
“O God! the days of my life were six. Three from six leaves 
three!” The third servant said to the others, “Don’t you know 
that man is a diviner? He knows that it is we who have stolen 
the money.” The third servant said to the fourth, “When you 
go, notice what he says.” When the fourth servant set the table, 
the diviner said, “O God! the days of my life were six. Four 
from six leaves two!” The fourth servant said to the others,

“We better consult with this man before he tells on us to the king. 
We are in great danger.” They went to the man, they confessed 
that it was they who stole the money. The man said, ““O you 
rascals! I was waiting two more days for you.” They brought 
him the money, he took it to the king.’ The king was so pleased, 
he gave a feast; he had the two compadres sit at the table with him. 
The next day the king gave another feast. He sent and got a 
cricket, he put it in a plate, he covered it up. He said to the 
diviner, “Now tell me what is in that plate.” The man scratched 
his head; he said, “Now it is the cricket sings!” They all 
thought he had guessed. The king was so well satisfied, he in- 
vited him to stay on another day. At this feast the king put the 
tail of a pig in the plate. After they had eaten and drunk, the 
king asked, “What is covered up in that plate?” The man 
scratched his head; he said, “‘Now the pig’s tail is twisted!” * 
Now the king was convinced that he was a diviner. He and his 
compadre went home, they lived well. 
63.4 UNCLE CARAMBAS 
There was once a man who owned nothing but a little piece of 
land. He sold it, he bought a suit of clothes and a cane He 
went down to the dock, he stood there with his cane in his hand 
and a cigar in his mouth. It was the first time he had seen the

“From three, two are gone, that makes one.” —“‘Of three, this is the last.” (San Nicolao.} 
2 Variant: The king picks up a black cricket and puts the hand holding it behind his 
back. “Tell me what I have in my hand,” he says. Jon Grill’ exclaims, “O Jon Grill’! 
see in whose hand you are now!”” (San Nicolao.) 
3 Variant: They ask him to guess the pig-dung in their hands. ‘“O feces [merda]!”’ 
he exclaims (a not unusual exclamation). Again, four oranges are put under a dish for 
him to discover; and he exclaims, “Now are the oranges four! [4go’ gue laranja al 
quat’!!’ (Cab’ Verde.) — This was explained as a reference to the following catch: “A 
doctor visits a woman. The woman has three oranges. She gives one to the doctor, his 
son Buticario, and his wife and daughter.” (O medico visitou a mulher. A mulher 
tinha tres laranjas. Deu um o medico seu filho Buticario e sua mulher e filha.) The 
statement is confused, but the catch consists in two of the four mentioned persons 
being the same person.

sea. A captain was there who was looking for a sailor to embark 
with him that day. The captain asked the man if he would 
embark with him. The man said no, he had been a sailor a long 
time, he was tired of the life. There was nobody else for the 
captain to get, he asked the man again to embark with him. 
Finally the man told him he would go with him, but on condition 
that he should not work except in bad weather. The captain 
agreed, they embarked. Next day arose a tempest like seven 
thousand devils. The captain summoned the man. He took a 
stone, he climbed the mast with it. It was a dark night. He 
dropped the stone through the rigging, and those on deck reported 
that the special sailor had fallen into the sea. Then he came 
down quietly, he hid himself in the place where they kept victuals. 
There he ate and drank every day. Every day when they pumped, 
his discharges came through the pump. The captain accused 
the other sailors. After they were out twenty-nine days, the 
man heard them say that land was in sight. He came out on the 
stern, he jumped into the sea, he seized the rudder. He began to 
yell, he said that for twenty-nine days he had been swimming 
after the ship. Had they not tacked to make port, never would 
he have caught up with the vessel. The captain sent a boat to 
pick him up. When he came, he gave him brandy and dry 
clothes.! 
In port the captain met a rich man, he told him that he had a 
sailor who could swim a month. The rich man said he had a 
Negro who could dive a month. They made a bet of seven 
1 Variants: (a) The ship sets sail. For three days Uncle Caramba does not come up on 
deck. When he does come up, he cannot keep his legs. The weather thickens. “If we 
have bad weather,” say the sailors, “we shall throw Uncle Caramba overboard.” At 
midnight the storm breaks. Uncle Caramba hears the captain say, “Stand by to take in 
sail!” While the sailors are aloft, he goes down into the hold and steals a bag of hard-tack. 
He takes a position in the rudder below. “We were planning to throw him overboard, he 
went overboard himself,” say the sailors. He hangs to the rudder-chains seventeen days 
and seventeen nights. During this time the captain’s little boy drops a watch overboard. 
It strikes Uncle Caramba on the head, and he grabs it. As the water grows muddy and 
they near shore, Uncle Caramba, who does not know how to swim, says to himself, “Some 
day I must die, at any rate,” and jumps overboard.... To prove that he has been 
swimming after the ship seventeen days, he shows the watch.... “Such aman mustn’t 
associate with the other sailors,” says the captain’s wife, “he must stay with us.” (San 
Nicolao.) 
(4) The boy agrees to ship with the captain he meets, on condition that he is called 
upon to work only in an emergency. Seventeen days out a storm arises, He sends all 
below. He lashes the rudder and keeps the boat up in the wind. The storm is over in 
three days. He slips overboard near the rudder. The captain comes up, and, not seeing him, laments losing a sailor so good that he can sail the vessel single-handed. He cries 
out from the water that he has been swimming three days. (Fogo.)

thousand dollars on the sailor and Negro as to which could dive 
and stay down a month. When they began to get ready to go, 
the sailor said, “I have still to get two fathoms of chain.” —‘‘ What 
for?”’? He answered, “To take with me, so that if this fellow 
wants to come up before the time agreed upon, I can tie him down 
there.” The Negro refused togo. Thecaptain won the bet. He 
divided seven thousand dollars with the sailor.’ 
The sailor told the captain that he was also a diviner. They 
went to another country. There the captain met another rich 
man. He told him that he had a sailor who could swim a month, 
dive a month, and could divine. They agreed to bury a hog three 
miles away, to blindfold his eyes, and tell him to find that hog. 
All the people of the city came out to see the boy find the hog. 
He went along with the captain. When he came to the spot, he 
was almost crazy, he stood still; he said, “O captain! now is the 
hog’s tail twisted!”” The hog lay buried underneath his feet. As 
soon as he spoke thus about the hog, the hog grunted, “Hom! 
hom!hom!” The captain won the bet, and he divided the money 
with him.? 
They went to another city. There, before two boys, sons of a 
rich man, the captain began to talk about his diviner. The boys 
put [some] faeces in paper. They said, “I [we] will give you five 
~ thousand dollars if you [he] know what they [we] had in their [our] 
hands.” He said, “You boys have no money, you are very young.” 
—‘‘We have no money, but our father has plenty.” He said to 
them,‘‘ You go get it.” They got it, he took it from them, he put 
it in his pocket, he started to go. The boys cried out, “‘Find out, 
or give us back our money!” He said to them, “You boys go to 
hell to play with feces!” They left him with five thousand

hotel manager. The distance to swim is ten miles.... Uncle Caramba says he has still 
to get seventy-five fathoms of chain to anchor himself when he cooks the two bushels of 
potatoes he is taking with him. ‘I’m not coming back to-day.” — “ I can’t swim that 
way,” says the other. 
(8) Arrived in port, in America, the captain boasts to another captain about his 
sailor.... The sailor calls for a barrel of flour, a barrel of salt meat, a barrel of water, 
to take with him. ‘‘You’re crazy,” says his competitor. “I go under the water only for 
two or three hours.” — ‘‘Oh, when I go, I stay for three months.” (Fogo.) 
2 Variant: After he gains fame from divining the buried pig, they give him a warship 
to captain, and to go to war at Gibraltar. He puts the vessel wholly into the hands of 
hig pilot, who succeeds in sinking the ship they encounter. Uncle Caramba is going 
ashore, ‘“‘What orders about anchoring?” asks the pilot. ‘‘How many anchors are 
there?” — “Six.” — “Let all go.” While he is on shore, a tempest arises which scatters 
all the ships but his. “You are aclever man,” the other captains remark. “Yes, I knew 
eight days ago that this storm was due.” (San Nicolao.)

him, “I worked hard for the money, and for the money the cap- 
tain already has in his pocket.” 
64. .THE DOCTOR AND THE DEVIL! 
There was a doctor in Brava named Lelexe. He was milking 
agoat. A devil came along, he asked him for a little milk. The 
doctor refused to give it to him. The devil turned into a rat, he 
went inside the gourd of milk. The doctor took the gourd, he 
buried it in the ground. A shepherd came by, he stepped on it, 
he broke it. The devil jumped out. The shepherd started to 
run, and the doctor started to run too. The devil said, “Doctor, 
don’t run! I want to make a contract with you. I’m going from 
here to Lisbon to make the princess sick. You are the only 
doctor who can cure her. What you get for it we will divide.” 
In one minute the devil was in Lisbon. (It takes a steamship 
six days.) The king sent to call all the doctors who were in Lisbon 
to cure the princess. There was a servant in the king’s house; 
she said to the king, ‘“‘I dreamed last night that there was a doctor 
in Brava who could cure the princess.”” The king sent a battle- 
ship to Brava to fetch Lelexe. When he arrived at Lisbon, he 
sent word to the king that he did not have the clothes they wore in 
that part of the country. So the king sent him the finest suit he 
had. The king asked him, “Are you going to save my daughter?” 
The doctor answered, “Yes.’’. He asked to see the patient alone. 
The devil’s name was Luc. The doctor called out, “‘Lug! Luc!! 
Lug!!!” [The narrator dramatized this by putting his head close 
to a man’s stomach and shouting.] Luc came out of the girl, 
he flew home.2 The king said, “Doctor, what is your charge?” —

2 It is an Island belief that sickness may be due to possession. The sick will talk with 
the voice of the witch in possession. (Fogo, Brava.) To exorcise her, a bit of her 
garments or shoe-leather is burned under the nose of the invalid. (Fogo.) — Black 
sheep’s wool is burned. (San Nicolao.) — The said’ will recommend the invalid’s snipping 
his ear or finger. This will cause the witch the loss of an ear or finger. (Brava.)— For a 
sick baby, put baby’s dress in the boiler, together with pins and needles. The witch 
will feel them in her body, and will come to the house, where the people refuse to take out 
the dress until she cures the baby. (Brava.) — If you stick needles or scissors, particu- 
larly scissors, in the door of your house, a visiting witch will not take leave until you take 
them out. (Fogo, San Nicolao.) — Muro is the name of a shrub that is burned in the 
house to discover a witch. (Fogo.) See JAFL 34:97-99.

“Nothing.” The king gave him a transport full of gold and 
riches, he sent him init to Brava. CompadreLugmethim. Angry, 
he said to him, “Why didn’t you ask him for two transports,— 
one for you, and one for me? I’m going back to Lisbon. This 
time nobody will be able to cure the princess.” The princess fell 
sick again. The king sent a battleship to Brava for Lelexe. He 
told his wife that this time he should not return, because he knew 
that they were going to kill him at Lisbon. When he arrived at 
the king’s house, he started to call, ““Compa’ Lug!’ Compa’ Luc!! 
Compa’ Lug!!!” Compadre Lug did not answer. He called 
again, “Compa’ Luc! Compa’ Lug!! Compa’ Lug!!!” He 
called loud, ““Compa’ Lug!! Compa’ Lug!!! Compa’ Lug!!!!”” 
Compa’ Lug did not answer. He called the king, he told him to 
send [some one] to fire off all his pieces at the same time, because 
the princess was crazy.1. They fired off the pieces, the devil called 
out; he asked, ‘‘What’s the matter, Compa’ Lelexe?”—“I was 
calling to you to get out. You better get out, because they are 
going to operate on the princess to-morrow, they are going to 
open her belly.” Out jumped the devil.2 Lelexe went back 
home with more wealth. All the money in the world is what was 
left of the money of Dr. Lelexe. 
65. MR. May! 
There was a man who raised pigs. His wife had to cook for 
them. She got very tired feeding the pigs. The man said to 
her, “One of these pigs we are not going to kill, it belongs to 
Mr. May.”* One day a man came to their house, he asked for a 
drink of water. The woman gave him a drink, and asked, 
“And you, what is your name? Is it Mr. May?” The man said, 
“Yes.” The woman said to him, “Then this pig is yours. God 
sent you here to-day.” The woman tied the pig with a rope, she 
gave it to the man. He took it to another place, where he got 
four men to carry the pig on a stretcher; he promised them half

the pig. The woman stood looking until the man disappeared. 
The woman was so glad to be rid of the pig, she never thought to 
ask if her husband said to sell it, or give it as a present. At night, 
when her husband came back, he sat down to eat; he said, 
“Wife, have you fed all the animals?” The woman answered, 
“Yes, I’m resting to-day. That pig is gone. Mr. May came 
here, I gave it to him.” The man dropped his knife and fork, he 
broke his plate. He asked, ‘“‘Which way did the man go?”— 
“That way, I looked until he disappeared.” The man started to 
go. The woman said to him, “Husband, I am going too.”— 
“Come on! but bring the door with you.” (He meant to say 
for her to shut the door and bring the key.) The woman went 
and pulled off the door and put it on her head. 
They went, went, went; they could not find the man. They 
came to a fig-tree the size of a house. They sat down in its shade. 
As they sat there, they heard sounds of wild animals,— jaguars, 
goats, wolves, bears, and tigers. The woman said, “We shall fare 
badly if we stay here. The wild animals will kill us. Let us 
climb this tree!” The man had been so intent on his journey, 
he had not looked back at his wife, he did not know she had the 
door. Up in the tree he looked down, he saw her with it. “Wife, 
what are you doing with that door?”—“Wasn’t it you who told 
me to bring it?” —“Wife, you are a disgrace to me! Climb up 
here with it. If you leave it behind, the wild animals will smell it, 
they will know that we are here, they will stay and kill us.” The 
woman managed to get up into the tree with the door. 
Up in the tree they heard the voices of robbers below. That 
was the place, inside a hole under the tree, to which seven robbers 
brought their booty every day. There they sat, they began to 
cook. The woman told her husband that she could not keep from 
urinating any longer, she would urinate. She urinated. The 
robbers below said, ‘““Oh, what good rain God sends us from the 
sky! Let us drink!” Then after a little the woman told her 
husband that she could not keep from defecating, that she would 
defecate. She defecated. The husband said to her, “You are a 
disgrace to me!” The robbers below felt it come, they opened. 
their mouths below; they said, ‘“‘Oh, what good bread God sends 
from the sky! Let us eat!” The woman said to her husband, 
“T can’t hold on to the door any longer.” —‘‘Hold on to it! Hold 
on toit! Ifit drops, they’ll hear us, they’ll kill us. Hold on to it! 
Hold on to it!” The robbers were talking about one place where

there was gold, another place where there was silver, another 
where there was money. The man heard everything they said. 
The woman was holding on to the door with her hands, then with 
her feet, then with her teeth. Finally she could not hold it any 
longer. The man said to her, ‘‘Woman, you are a disgrace to me! 
Let it go!” The door fell down, knocking on the branches, 
making a clatter. The robbers were frightened, they ran away! 
Some broke their legs; others, their arms; others blinded them- 
selves in the briers. They ran and ran until they lost sight of one 
another.? 
The moon was shining bright. The woman looked down, she 
saw something brilliant. The man was almost asleep. The 
woman said to him, “Don’t you see something shining down 
there?””—“‘No, that is the moon shining. Shut up! Keep quiet, 
so the wild animals will leave us alone!” About four in the morn- 
ing the wild animals went their way through the forest. They 
came down, they found all the riches the robbers left behind,— 
much on the ground, much more under the ground. The man 
was crazy with delight. He covered it all up with stones and 
grass, so that none passing by would see it. He made a little shed 
to stay in during the day. At night they staid in the tree. The 
man said, “I’m going to find a carpenter to make us a house here. 
We can’t carry this treasure away from here.” A carpenter made 
them a house beside the tree. There they lived a new life, a life 
new. Never did they think again of Mr. May. The door she 
brought he made the door of his room, because it had given him a 
fortune. That door he set more store by (literally, “wanted ’’) 
than anything in the world. The woman sent to France to get 
a servant, because she was no longer a cook for pigs. 
(Variant a.*) 
There were a man and woman, they were raising a pig. The 
man said to the woman, “This pig we shall not kill, it is for Mr. 
May.” As they stood talking about the pig, a man passed by and 
heard all they said. There came a day [when] the husband went 
out hunting. After the husband went, there came a man; he

said to the woman, “I come to get a pig.”” The woman said, 
“No, this pig belongs to Mr. May.” The man said to her, “I 
am Mr. May.” The woman gave him the pig, he went on his 
way. Next day, when the husband came home, he went to the 
pig-pen; he said, “Where is Mr. May?” The woman answered, 
““A man came here saying his name was Mr. May, I gave him the 
pig.” The husband said, “Which way did that man go?” The 
woman showed him. He started out after the man.. The woman 
went after him. When he had walked a matter of two miles, he 
looked back; he saw the woman coming after him; he said to her, 
“Where are you going, woman?”—“I’m coming after you.” 
The man saw the house-door open; he said, “What are you doing? 
Go back, lock that door, bring it in your hand.” The woman went 
back, she pulled the door off its hinges, she locked it, she put it 
on her head, she went after her husband. The husband had gone 
a matter of four leagues more, he looked back, he saw the woman 
coming, tired and all sweaty. He said to her, “O woman! what 
in the world are you doing?” The woman said, “You told me to 
bring it in my hand. It is very heavy, I cannot bring it in my 
hand, I put it on my head.”—“O woman of God! you are a dis- 
grace to me!” They went back to the house, they found that 
some one had stolen all the things they owned. They began life 
anew. 
66. THE CHANGED NOTE 
There was a very poor man who lived near the king’s house. 
One night his' wife gave birth to a son, he went to the king’s house 
to ask for something for her. ‘Did she have a male or female?” 
asked the king. But the king gave him nothing, and chased him 
away. That night the queen gave birth to a girl. The king 
dreamed that the poor man’s boy would become the husband of 
his daughter. He felt bad about it, because the family was too 
poor for his daughter to marry into. Next morning the king 
went to the poor man’s house to ask if he would sell him the child. 
“No, I can’t sell my son,” said the man. “Give him to me, then, 
to bring up with my daughter, because they were born the same 
day and the same hour.” With these sweet words the king fooled 
them. They gave him the boy. He put him into a box and 
threw him into the sea. The box floated, it came ashore in a

river where there was a mill. The miller'saw the box moving, 
he opened it, he found the little one. He was glad, because he 
was married and he had no children. They raised the boy like 
their own child. ‘They sent him to school. One day, when he 
was seventeen years old, the king happened to ride past the house. 
He talked to the miller, he asked if he had a son. The miller 
answered, “I have no son; but I have a boy at school I found 
seventeen years ago in a box floating on the river.’ Then the 
king remembered the child he had cast into the sea. Just then 
the boy came in. The king asked the miller if he would let the 
boy take a note into the city for him. In the note the king wrote, 
“As soon as this boy arrives, cut off his head.” The boy walked 
all day. At night in the woods he saw a light, he walked to it. 
In the house was an old woman; she said to him, “Boy, you better 
goon. This is a house of robbers. If they find you here, they 
will kill you.”. He answered, “If they want to kill me, let them 
kill me. If I go on through the woods, I shall be killed by wild 
beasts.” He was tired, he lay down on a bench and went to sleep. 
Later on in came the robbers. One wanted to kill him. “No,” 
said another, “let’s see what he has in his pockets!” They 
searched, they found the note. reading, “As soon as this boy 
arrives, cut off his head,” and signed by the king. “Now let us 
save the life of this boy,” said the robbers. They scratched out 
“cut off his head,” and in its place they wrote ‘‘marry him at 
once to the princess.”” Next morning the boy walked into the 
city to the king’s house. The queen opened the letter, she called 
for the priest, the boy and the princess were married at once. 
When the king returned, thinking to find the boy dead, he found 
him instead married to his daughter. He was so enraged, he died 
of passion. The boy was made king; and his wife, queen. 
Finished. 
67. THE Two RaTs.! 
There was a man married toa woman. They had two children, 
a boy and a girl. They called each other “Little Brother” and 
“Little Sister.” One day the boy asked his mother if he might 
marry Little Sister. His mother said, “No, that cannot be.” 
But he kept thinking about it, and he asked his mother again. 
She said to him, “‘Go see the priest. If he agrees, you may marry 
her.” He went to the priest. ‘“‘No, that cannot be,” said the

priest. But the boy persisted. “Very well,” said the priest, 
“you may marry her if first you go into the pasture and eat grass 
for seven years.” The boy agreed, and he went into the pasture 
and ate grass. 
When the seven years were past, he returned home, he bathed, 
he went to the priest. The priest said, “I can marry you to 
Little Sister; but whoever dies first, the other will have to be 
buried at the same time.” He called Little Sister, he talked it 
over with her. She agreed. The priest married them. Six 
months later Little Sister died. He had to be buried with her, 
because that was the promise. He had a grave dug large and 
wide, and lined with stones. He put into it his table and books. 
He had a casket for Little Sister, he put her in it on one side of the 
grave. Then he had the grave closed up and covered with earth. 
Three days passed, he saw two little rats trying to gnaw Little 
Sister’s casket. He drove them off. A little later they were back 
again. ‘You want to eat up Little Sister, but I’m going to settle 
you,” said he. He kicked them to death, he threw them aside. 
When he went to see where he had thrown them, there in their 
place he found a little straw. He said to himself, “This little 
straw must be good. It gives life to rats, it may give life to the 
dead.” He opened the casket, he tapped Little Sister’s face three 
times; he said, ‘Little straw, you give life to little rats, give life 
to Little Sister.” The second time Little Sister stirred, the third 
time she got up. She said, “Who are you over me?” He 
answered, “I am your little brother and your husband.” He 
told her she had been dead. Then he started to work a way out. 
The stones and earth caved in, they came out. He said, “Don’t 
let us go where there are people, because they will think we are 
witches.” They took a road to the shore. He had not slept for three 
days, so on the shore he put his head in her lap and went to sleep. 
While he slept, there passed by a squad of soldiers. The cap- 
tain saw the girl. He dismounted, and asked her if she would go 
along with him, leaving the boy there asleep. She said, “No, 
this boy is my husband.” The captain took out a pistol, he 
pointed it at her, he ordered her to go with him. She said, “He 
has his head in my lap. If I move, he’ll feel it.” The captain 
took off his coat and gave it to her to put under the boy’s head. 
Then she went away with the captain.1

When the boy woke up, he did not find his sister, he wondered 
what he should do! He said to himself, “I’ll go home and enlist 
in the army, because I’m a lost man [home’ perdito].”” He was a 
clean, fine-looking fellow, so the captain invited him up to the 
house. At the door he saw the girl, she saw him, she ran to her 
room. After he left, she said to the captain, “Don’t you know 
that is my husband?”—‘Oh, the rascal! I'll settle him,” said 
the captain. The captain went to a soldier; he said to him, “I 
have a favor to ask of you. Oblige me, and I’ll give you a stripe.” 
—‘What is it?”—“T’ll give you my watch and some money. 
Make No. 17 drunk, and put them in his pocket.”” The soldier 
answered, “I will do you any favor but that. That is fraud.”— 
“You’re no man,” said the captain, and he went to another soldier. 
“T have a favor to ask of you. Oblige me, and I’ll give you a 
stripe.’ —“‘What is it??—“T’ll give you my watch and some 
money. Make No. 17 drunk, and put them in his pocket.””— 
“°Tis an easy thing to do,” said the soldier. He invited No. 17- 
to walk out with him. ‘I can’t go without the permission of the 
commander.”—“Oh, he’ll give you leave.” He got leave, he 
went. They went to a coffee-house (dotiguim). They drank 
until No. 17 got drunk, the soldier put the watch in his pocket. 
The next morning the commander said his watch had been stolen. 
They searched all the soldiers in the barracks. No. 17 was still 
in bed, because he had been drinking all night. The soldier who 
had put the watch in his pocket was the one to search him. He 
found the watch. The captain said, “It is you, whom I treated 
so well. I never invited a soldier to my house before, and then 
you went and stole my watch. You shall die to-day at one 
o’clock.” He said, “It must be some trick. In my father’s 
house were gold watches, I was never covetous of them.”— 
“Your face shows you a thief. I take no excuse. To-day at one 
you die.”—“T have a favor to ask of you.”—‘‘I will grant you 
any favor except letting you past the gates.” He called the 
cook; he said, “I have a favor to ask of you.”—‘‘ What is it?”   
“T’m going to be executed to-day at one. Take this little straw. 
When they bury me, mark well my grave. When every one has 
left, dig me up and touch my face with this straw, and say, 
governor rides by, and asks Maria to go with him, He gives her a magic pillow to put 
under Manuel’s head to make him sleep. (Fogo.)

“You give little rats life, you give Little Sister life, give Little 
Brother life.” The captain sent to dig the grave. He stood 
No. 17 up alongside, two soldiers shot, he tumbled into the 
grave. The cook was there; he said, “Ay! Our friend No. 17 
was a good soldier to die such a death.” He marked the grave, 
that night he dug it up. He tapped the face of the corpse with 
the straw; he said, “You give little rats life, you give Little 
Sister life, give Little Brother life.” At the third tap, the boy got 
up. He asked, “Who is over me?”—“TI am the cook, your 
friend.” The boy got out of the grave, he refilled it with earth. 
The straw he divided in two, he gave half to the cook, he kept the 
other half. He took leave of the cook, he walked forth into the 
country.! 
After walking three days, he came to the city. There he heard 
that the daughter of the king lay dead. He went to the king’s 
house, but the guard would not let him in. He said, “The 
princess is dead, the king receives nobody.”—“If you let me in, 
I'll bring the princess back to life.” The guard reported this to 
the king, the king ordered him to be let in. “He said to the king, 
“Let me see the body, I will bring it back to life.” The king 
sent him into the room with a soldier. He told the soldier to 
shut the door and go. The soldier shut the door, but he stood 
behind it. The boy took the straw, he tapped the face of the 
princess; he said, “You give little rats life, you give Little Sister 
life, you give Little Brother life, give the princess life.” At the 
third tap the princess said, “‘Who is over me?”—“I am Maninh’ 2 
who gave you life.” The princess said, “I was asleep, I was not 
dead.”—‘‘You were dead.” The soldier overheard this talk, he 
reported it to the king. When he went into the room and saw 
his daughter alive, he embraced her and he embraced Maninh’. 
He told his daughter that she had been sick, and that after three 
consultations (juntas), in which the doctors could not help, she 
died; then the boy came and revived her. She said, “He is

going to be my husband.” After the marriage, Maninh’ told the 
king his story, he asked him for a regiment of soldiers to take to 
the place where the captain was stationed. When he arrived 
there, he had a grave dug. On one side he stood the captain; on 
the other, Little Sister. He told one soldier to make a target of 
the captain, another soldier to make a target of Little Sister. 
They fell into the grave and were covered over.’ The soldier 
who had tricked him he demoted from being a sergeant. The 
soldier who had refused to trick him he promoted. The cook he 
made captain. He returned to live at the king’s house, there he 
still lives. 
68. HIS BEST FRIEND.? 
There were two compadres in San Vicente who were great 
friends. They always walked out together, and every evening 
they sat down in the plaza to talk. One was married, one was 
unmarried. One day the bachelor turned to the married man, 
and said, ““Compadre, who is the best friend you have in the 
world?”—‘“I think my best friend is my wife.’—‘You are mis- 
taken, your wife is not your best friend.” (The married man had 
a dog he valued.) “To find out that your wife is not your friend, 
buy a pig, put it in a sack, take it to-night to her door, knock, and 
say, ‘I have killed a man, and I want to bury him before morning 
to escape the law.’” The married man agreed. When he told 
his wife he had committed a disgrace, she got up quickly and 
helped him dig a grave. Next day the two compadres met in the 
same plaza. The bachelor asked, “Did your wife help you dig 
the grave?” —“‘Yes, she did, and I am satisfied she is my friend.” 
—‘Now prove it,” said the bachelor. ‘‘Go home, move the furni- 
ture around, tell her she is not taking proper care of it or of the 
house. Tell her you feel like getting some one else to keep house.”” 
The married man went home, he did as he was told. When he 
told his wife she was a poor housekeeper, she got angry, she 
answered back. He slapped her. She called out, “4gui del rei!’ 
When people came, she said her husband wanted to do to her 
what he had done to a man the night before. They investigated,

they arrested the man. His compadre went and declared it was 
only a pig they had buried. He took them to the spot, they 
exhumed the pig. They set the man free. The bachelor said 
to his compadre, “Now take your dog. Beat him as hard as you 
can. Then snap your fingers to call him to you. You will see 
him come to you as a friend, it will prove that your best friend is 
your dog. Women are not the friends of men. They are ex- 
clusively the friends of their own interests. Their only wish is 
for men to give them everything.”

Big-Rat and Susana.* They cooked before they went out to

waited, waited, waited; he did not come. Then Susana went to 
the house. She found John Big-Rat inside the pot of samp; 
Susana pulled the door off the hinges, she put it on the ground, 
she sat down on it to cry. Passed by a Bluejay. He asked her,

Big-Rat told me to wait for him, he would come back. I waited 
and waited for him. He didn’t come. I went to the house, I

“If you do not marry me to her, I shall kill you, and you and the

married him to Julia. Then he disappeared. For a long time 
he was afraid to go to the garden; but he had to go, for there was 
famine in the land. Carlotta told him to bring her an apple. 
He picked the apple and what else he wanted. He came home.

school-children were envious. They kept teasing him; they said 
he was the son of a man who gave his daughters for a flower, a 
peach, and an apple. He came home. He asked his mother 
about his sisters. His mother told him that he was the only child. 
Finally she told him about his sisters. He said that he had to go 
find them. 
[Here follows the orange-rolling incident to get the invisible- 
making hat and the accommodating shoes (see p. 293).] He 
told his shoes to take him to the door of his eldest sister. When 
he arrived there, his sister said to him, “What are you doing here? 
Tve been here twenty years; and in the twenty years not a 
creature has passed by, not even a fly. But don’t stay here, 
because, if my husband finds you here, he will kill you.” He said 
to her, “I will put on my hat, he will not see me.” In half an 
hour the house began to shake, her husband arrived. He ate 
dinner, he started to leave. His wife began to cry. She said to 
him, “It is twenty years since I’ve been here, you have not staid 
with me two hours at a time.”—“I cannot stay. I like you a 
great deal, but I cannot stay, because my enchantment is not 
yet ended.”—“‘Why don’t you give me a companion?” —‘ Who 
is there?” —“There is my brother. If you promise me that you

will not kill him, I will show him to you.”—“I have not the heart 
to kill your brother. Had I the heart to kill your brother, I'd 
" have had the heart to kill you.” When Anton took off his hat, 
they saw him. He was much pleased, he begged him to stay with 
them. But Anton said that he had still to see his other sisters. 
As he was going, his brother-in-law gave him a feather. He told 
him to call on it if he needed to. 
Then Anton bade his shoes put him in the house of his second 
sister. His second sister begged him not to stay, because, if her 
husband found him there, he would kill him. When her husband 
came, he put on his hat. He did not see him. He ate dinner. 
When he finished eating, he started to leave. His wife said to 
him, “It is twenty years since I’ve been here, you have never staid 
with me two hours at a time.”—“I cannot stay. I cannot stay 
with you, because my enchantment is not yet ended.”—‘‘Why 
don’t you give me a companion?”—‘‘ Who is there?” —‘‘ There is 
my brother. If you promise me that you will not kill him, I will 
show him to you.”—‘Had I the heart to kill him, then I should 
have the heart to kill you.” Then Anton appeared. He was 
much pleased with him. He begged him to stay with them. 
Anton said that he had still to see his youngest sister. He started 
to go. His brother-in-law gave him the scale of a fish. He told 
him to call on it when he needed help. 
He begged his shoes to put him in the house of his youngest 
sister. His sister said to him, ‘‘Do not stay here, because, if my 
husband finds you here, he will kill you.” He said to her, “‘I will 
put on my hat, he will not see me.” Half an hour later the house 
began to shake, the stones to fall down. When he arrived, he ate 
dinner. When he finished dinner, he started to go. His wife 
said to him, “In all these years we have been married, you have 
never been with me two hours at a time.” —“I cannot stay, be- 
cause my enchantment is not yet ended.” She said to him, “Why 
do you not give me a companion?”—‘ Who is there?” —“If you 
promise me that you will not kill him, I will show him to you.”— 
“‘Had I the heart to kill him, I should have had the heart to kill 
you.” Anton took off his hat, he appeared. He was. much 
pleased. He started to go. His brother-in-law gave him a horn. 
The boy begged his shoes to put him at the door of the fairest 
face in the world. When he arrived there, she begged him not to 
stay there, for the devil she lived with would kill him. The devil 
stole her from her father’s house when she was a child.

Anton said to her, ‘“‘Ask the devil where his life is.” When the 
devil came home, she asked him where his life was. He fooled 
her, he told her that it was in the verandah. Anton did not 
think that it was. He told the girl to put plants in the verandah, 
to water them five or six times a day. The devil saw her watering 
these plants so much that there was no time to eat. He asked 
her why she watered the plants so much. “I am watering them 
because you told me that your life was here in the verandah.” 
The devil began to laugh. He said to her, ‘‘Now I will tell you, 
indeed, where my life is. My life is inside an egg which is inside a 
dove which is inside an iron chest which is inside a wooden chest 
at the bottom of the sea. If any one touched the chest, I should 
fall sick. If any one took out the egg and broke it on my face, I 
should die; and if he broke it anywhere else; I should be sick 
forever, but I should not die.” Anton overheard all this conver- 
sation. He went to the shore, where he took out his fish-scale. 
He asked it to bring him the chest which was at the bottom of the 
sea. The fish brought the chest ashore to him. The devil fell 
sick. The carpenter whom Anton sent for was not able to open 
the chest. He took out his horn, he asked it to help him open the 
chest. The horn became an ox. It butted the chest, it opened 
it. A dove came out and flew off. Anton took out his feather. 
He asked the king of the birds to help him. The king of the birds 
flew after the dove. He caught it, he brought it to Anton. He 
killed the dove. He took out the egg. He took it to the house of 
the devil. Anton asked him, ‘Where is your life?” He an- 
swered, “In the palm of your hand.” Then Anton broke the egg 
on his head. He killed him. He married the girl. He took her 
to his country and his family. And they are living happily to 
this day. 
73. THE TWO FRIENDS: HIS LIFE IN AN EGG.! 
There was a king of Spain who had lost all his children. He 
went to the said’ to ask him how to have a child and save it. The 
saib’ said, “As soon as the child is born, put him in a house under 
the ground, let him stay there with his nurse sixteen years.” 
When the child was fifteen, he began to insist upon coming out. 
His nurse told his father, his father consulted the said’. The 
sail’ said, “Keep a band of musicians in the house to amuse him

for the remaining year.” The day the boy was sixteen he broke 
out of the house; on the road, coming to see him, he met the king, 
his father, with his troops. The king wanted to greet him.? 
“Don’t embrace me!”’ said the boy. “You are not my father. 
Were you my father, you would not have let me grow up in a hole 
in the ground.” ? 
In Russia there was a king who had a daughter who dreamed 
every night about the boy in Spain. A sai’ told her father that 
she loved the Spaniard, and would have something to do with 
him. So the king her father put her in a hole in the ground 
guarded by soldiers. , 
Through their said’ the King of Spain and his son heard about 
the Russian princess. The prince, whose name was Flor de 
Bonit’, asked his father for a cart filled with money,— a cart that 
could run on land and water. In it for six months they were at 
sea, out of sight of land. Then they made land, Flor de Bonit’ 
sent the cook ashore for fresh meat. On shore the cook saw a boy 
going on his way to the gallows. He looked so like Flor de 
Bonit’, that the cook mistook him; he hastened back to the cart 
to get money to save him, if money could save him. “You are 
joking, I haven’t been ashore,” said Flor de Bonit’ to the cook. 
“Come with me, I’ll show you,” said the cook. When they went 
ashore, they found the boy at the foot of the gallows. “What 
have you done to be sent to the gallows?” asked Flor de Bonit’. 
“Since my birth nobody has beaten me. It is for this I am being 
sent to the gallows,” answered the boy. Then Flor de Bonit’ 
said to the people there, “I want to save this boy. What must I 
do?”—“Bring enough money to weigh against him.” So Flor 
de Bonit’ brought from the ship two sacks of money,— one to 
weigh against the boy, the other to give as alms to the poor. 
“Tl be your servant for the rest of my life,” said the boy, whose 
name was Bonit’. “Not so,” said Flor de Bonit’. “Be my 
friend, a true friend for life. Come with me on my cart.” *— 
“T will go with you; but before I go, I must take leave of my 
mother.” They went to her together; when she saw them, she 
said, “I do not know which of you is my son.” Her son said,

“We are both your son. Give us your blessing.”-——“‘ The charge 
I put on you is, that wherever night overtakes you, there you 
sleep.” 
Flor de Bonit’ discharged his crew, with his friend he began the 
journey. When night fell, they were under a cliff. Bonit’ said, 
“Let us sleep here! Remember what my mother said.” But 
Flor de Bonit’ answered, “We should not sleep here under the 
cliff, where stones may fall down on us. Let us go to that plain 
yonder, where we shall be safe!” When they reached the plain, 
Flor de Bonit’ said, “T’ll lie down first and sleep, and you watch. 
At midnight do you sleep, and I’ll watch.” It was a cloudy night. 
While Bonit’ was watching, he saw a figure approaching. The 
figure was a devil; he said to Bonit’, “What are you doing here? 
Don’t you know this is not a time for the living?”—“lIt is the 
right time for me, but not for you,” answered Bonit’. “Do you 
see that thing over there?” asked the devil. “It is an ox; go and 
kill him, skin him, bring him here.”—“T’ll kill him just to show 
you I’m not afraid,” said Bonit’; “but, as for skinning him, you’ve 
got to skin him yourself and bring him here.” The ox tried to 
kill Bonit’; but he killed the ox, then the devil went and skinned 
him. “Now let us wrestle!” said the devil. “The winner takes 
the soul of the loser.” Twice Bonit’ put him down; then he said, 
“Tm going to cut off your head.”—“‘No, the bet is three times,” 
said the devil; he turned now bulky, now tall, now little. But 
Bonit’ put him down the third time, and he pulled out his sword 
tokillhim. ‘Don’t kill me! T’ll turn into a she-ass, and do you 
pull out the thickest hair from my tail.2. Whenever you are in 
danger, call out, ‘Help me, sea-horse!’”* After the devil took 
his departure, Bonit’ was sorry he had let him go. ‘‘He has been 
fooling me,” said Bonit’ to himself. “Why did Ilet him go? At 
any rate, I'll test the hair.” He said, “Help me, sea-horse!”’ 
Immediately the devil appeared, fire came out from his eyes and 
his mouth. “What’s the matter with you? Didn’t I just leave 
you all right?”-——“‘I’m in no danger,” answered Bonit’. “I only 
called you to give you something.”—“I want nothing but a cer- 
tain ointment, and that you haven’t got,” said the devil. 
The next morning Flor de Bonit’ asked Bonit’ why he had-not

called him. ‘Oh, you were asleep, I didn’t want to bother you,” 
answered Bonit’. “I am going for a girl I love,” said Flor de 
Bonit’, “‘and I want you to be true to me.” They came to a 
little hill overlooking a big city. “Stop here,” said Bonit’, “V’ll 
go into the city to see if I can get news of the girl.” As he went 
into the city, he saw men’s heads spiked on the gates. He went 
toabean-shop. ‘Why are those heads there?” he asked. “They 
are the heads of the kings and princes who have come here and 
asked the name of the king’s daughter,” answered the bean-seller. 
“What is her name?” asked Bonit’. Immediately the bean-seller 
lay hold of his machad’ to kill him. “No,no! I’m just fooling,” 
cried Bonit’. “I’m a bean-merchant too. Don’t you see my 
cart up there on the hill? Itis full of beans. I sell a sack for one 
hundred reis, and a guarta for a pataca.”'!—“Tf that’s your price, 
T’ll buy of you,” said the bean-merchant. ‘‘Come with me, then, 
to the cart.” Half way there, Bonit’ pulled his sword from under 
his coat; he said, “Now, if you don’t tell me her name, I’ll kill you 
on the spot.”—~“‘I can’t tell you her name or where she is. I don’t 
know,” said the man. “But I can tell you the name of the tailor 
who makes clothes for her every day, he can tell you.” Bonit’ 
cut a button off his trousers; he went to the tailor; he said, “I 
want you to sew on this button.”—“‘You’ve just cut it off,” said 
the tailor. “That’s no business of yours,” said Bonit’; “your 
business is tailoring.”—‘“‘Very well,” said the tailor. He sewed 
on the button, he charged Bonit’ fifty thousand reis. Then Bonit’ 
asked him the name of the girl and where she lived. The tailor 
seized a stick to kill him. “No, no! I’m just fooling,” cried 
Bonit’. “I’m a silk-merchant. Don’t you see my cart up there 
onthe hill? It is full of silk. I sell silk a paraca a yard.”—“If 
that is your price, I will buy of you. We are short of silk,” 
said the tailor. “Come with me, then, to the cart.” Half way, 
Bonit’ pulled out his sword; he said, “If you don’t tell me her 
name and where she is, I’ll kill you on the spot. This will be the 
last day of your life.” The tailor told Bonit’ that the girl and her 
guards lived under a lake. “You can’t reach her without this 
powder. Throw it, the water will divide for you to go through. 
Throw it into the eyes of the guards, they will fall asleep.’ ?

Bonit’ took the powder, he threw it as directed. The waters 
opened, the guards fell asleep, he found the girl in her room, asleep 
too. At her head was a gold light; at her feet, a silver light. 
Under her head was a big book in which she had written down her 
dreams of Flor de Bonit’. The nights she had dreamed of him 
were the same nights he had dreamed of her. Bonit’ changed the 
lights, he put the gold in place of the silver, the silver in place of 
the gold. Then he wrote in the book, “At the very hour you are 
dreaming of Flor de Bonit’, he is in your room.” 
When Bonit’ returned to the car, Flor de Bonit’ asked if he had 
heard anything. “No, but I will try again to-morrow. To- 
morrow they say that news from all over the world will come to 
this city.” The next day Bonit’ went into the city under the lake. _ 
The guards fell asleep again, but the princess had used an ointment 
to keep awake. When Bonit’ entered, she started to embrace 
him. “Don’t embrace me! I am not your husband. I am 
Bonit’.. Your husband is Flor de Bonit’.”—‘‘ There can be none 
better-looking than you,” said the princess. ‘None better- 
looking, but there is one who looks like me.”—“‘You are false,”’ 
cried the princess. “‘It is on your account my father has put me 
here; yesterday, when you came, you left without giving me even 
a single kiss.” —“ Your husband is coming to get you,” said Bonit’. 
“Get ready!”” Bonit’ doubted whether Flor de Bonit’ had cour- 
age enough to go there for the princess. “If I take her to him, 
however,” he said to himself, “he may get jealous. But I will 
test him. On my return to the car I will call out that they are 
killing me. If he has courage, he will come to my aid.” Within 
fifty feet of the car Bonit’ called out, Flor de Bonit’ rushed up 
with drawn sword and started to attack him. “Don’t you know 
it is Bonit’ you are attacking?” cried he. “I have found out 
where your wife is.” —“‘ Now the fight really begins!” cried Flor de 
Bonit’. But Bonit’ dropped his sword. “Go yourself and get 
her; if you find anything amiss with her, you may kill me.” 
Then Flor de Bonit’ went in and got the girl. He brought her 
back to the cart, and said, “Now let us leave! I have what I

came for.”—Do not go thus!” said Bonit’. “Wait until she has 
seen her father and mother.” When the king visited the place 
where his daughter lived,— that very day was his day to visit 
her,— and found her gone, he took no excuses from the guards, 
he cut off their heads. Then he sent two hundred soldiers to 
bring back his daughter and the man who stole her,— to bring 
them or their heads. Bonit’ got his sword ready. “Sit still! 
I am going to face the two hundred alone,” said Flor de Bonit’. 
“The king summons you,” they told him. “If he wants to see me, 
he can come himself,” said Flor de Bonit’. “I too am of royal 
blood.”—“‘Our order is to bring you or your head.”” Then Flor 
de Bonit’ killed a hundred and ninety-six of them, leaving four 
alive to carry the news.! Then the king had the drum beaten to 
summon all the people of the kingdom, including the blind and 
the lame. Four million assembled. At the sight of so great a 
’ multitude, Flor de Bonit’ was frightened. ‘‘Come, let us leave 
this place!” said he. “I thought you had more courage,” said 
Bonit’. ‘Come, make ready! we’ll fight on horseback.”—“On 
horseback! You’re crazy. Where are the horses?” Bonit’ 
burned the hair of the she-ass; when the devil appeared, he asked 
him for two horses so caparisoned with gold and silver as to dazzle 
the eyes. To the horses he said, ‘When we kill, you kill too.’’ 
They killed, killed, killed, until they left none living but the bean- 
merchant, the tailor, and the king and queen. “If you want to 
see your daughter, come now,” said Flor de Bonit’; we are going 
to leave you these two men to fetch you water.” After the king 
and queen had come and seen their daughter, Bonit’ said to them, 
“Go now, that you may not be burned by the spark from our 
swords!” The king ran, and the queen behind him ran. Her 
skirt dropped. “Wait for me!” she cried. “I can’t wait!” 
called the king. “Pick up your skirt and run!’ The bean- 
merchant and the tailor ran a little way; then one said to the 
other, “Let us hide here, and watch those two fools fence!’ 
The pasture was very dry, presently the sparks from the swords. 
set iton fire. Then the fire reached the two in hiding, and burned 
them up.

had taken her. So he made magic against them. They were on 
the water. Flor de Bonit’ was fishing. No sooner had he caught 
a little fish than he and the vessel were turned into rocks, there 
among them Bonit’ found himself.1 He was there three days, 
when he heard a whistle. It was a shepherd. ‘What are you 
doing here?” he asked. “I don’t know. I was at sea, suddenly I 
found myself ashore here among the rocks.” —“It is a prince who 
has you all enchanted here. Take my clothes, give me yours. 
[The clothes of Bonit’ were handsome; those of the shepherd, 
lousy; but there was no help for it.] Take these goats, this 
milk and cheese. When the prince asks for cheese, give him milk. 
When he asks for a goat, give him a cheese.”’? 
Bonit’ went to the prince’s house, there he found the girl the 
prince had taken from them. After she recognized Bonit’, she © 
told him how since she had been there the prince had promised 
her riches of all kinds, but that she had not spoken to him. 
“Don’t act that way!” said Bonit’. ‘‘When he comes, run and 
embrace him! Say that you don’t expect to see your husband 
again. Say that your only fear now is that his life may be but 
brief.” When she did all this, the prince said, ‘Do not fear! I 
am a man who will never die.” She answered, “The man who 
will never die is not to be found in this world.”—“I am such a 
man.”—‘‘ What kind of a life have you, that you will never die?” 
—“That is a secret I must not tell to any one, no matter how 
much I love her.”—‘“Unless you tell me, I will not marry you. 
If you do not trust me enough to tell me, I shall not trust you 
enough to marry you.’ ‘Then the prince said, “My life is in an 
iron box, the largest in the world, at the bottom of the sea; inside 
of the box is a pig, the strongest creature in the world; inside of 
the pig is a dove, the swiftest flier in the world; inside of the dove 
is an egg, the hardest in the world; inside of the egg is a light,? 
that light is my life. When that light goes out, I shall die.” *— 
“T see now that you will never die,” said the princess, and she 
told Bonit’. Bonit’ told her he was going to work on the prince.

“He will fall sick, lie down, and never get up again. He will call 
you, but do not go near him.” 
Bonit’ returned to the shore, he pulled out the hair of the she- 
ass, he burned it; he said, ‘““Help me, sea-horse!”—‘‘What do 
you want?” asked the devil. ‘“‘I want you to get me the iron 
chest, the largest in the world, at the bottom of the sea.” The 
devil pulled out his book, he read off the names of all the fish in 
the world but one, the crab. None of the fish could tell him the 
whereabouts of the chest. Then the devil called Crab. ‘‘Had 
you been one minute later, ’d have jumped after you into the 
sea.”—“I was around the iron chest, the largest in the world, 
at the bottom of the sea, I lost one of my claws, that made me 
slow in coming,” answered Crab! “Go and fetch that chest.”— 
“Tt is too heavy. All the fish here could not bring it.” Then the 
devil summoned four whales. They swam to the place where lay 
the chest; they spouted four times; they threw the chest up on- 
the land. “Give me two sledge-hammers, and go back whence 
you came,” said Bonit’ to the devil. But Bonit’ wore out the 
sledge-hammers without making any impression on the chest. 
He again summoned the devil. “You bother me too much,” 
said the devil. “I have a soul to melt, you detain me.”—“‘It’s 
a greater sin for you to melt that soul than to come when I call.” 
“What do you want?”—“Open that chest.” The devil turned 
into a mule, he kicked the chest twice, he kicked it open. Out 
came the pig. The devil kicked the pig dead. ‘‘Give mea knife, 
and go back whence you came,” said Bonit’ to the devil. He cut © 
open the pig, out flew the dove. Again Bonit’: summoned the 
devil. ‘Don’t you know this is the last day I have to melt that 
soul? His time is up to-day.”—‘“‘ Melting that soul may be a sin. 
Coming here is a debt you owe me.” —‘‘What do you want?”— 
“Go fetch me that dove.” Then the devil opened his book, he 
called the names of all the birds of the world; but not one bird 
could tell where the dove had flown. There was but one bird 
lacking, Water-Buzzard. Up it flew. “Had you been one 
minute later, I’d have flown after you into the air,” said the devil. 
“T was flying here when I met a pretty dove, I stopped and played 
with her,” said Water-Buzzard. ‘‘Go and fetch that dove,” said 
the devil. Water-Buzzard brought them the dove; Bonit’ killed it, 
he took out the egg? He went with it to the place of the prince.

“O Bonit’! give me the egg to hatch out one of my brood,” said 
the prince. “‘I’ll give it to you, but first tell me about your riches 
here. What are these three little stones?”—“‘Those are three 
little bluejays who flew about here and damaged my garden.”— 
“What! You enchant even birds! What is that mound?”— 
“That I wouldn’t tell you even if it cost me my life.” —“Oh, you 
don’t want the egg, then?” —“That mound is a fort I keep en- 
chanted. Were I to disenchant it, nobody in the world could 
overcome me in war.”—‘‘What’s that barrel of grease there?””— 
“That I wouldn’t tell you if it cost me my life.”—“I’m going, 
then, and the egg with me.’—“‘ Everything I rub with that grease 
becomes disenchanted.” Bonit’ rubbed some on the three little 
stones, three little bluejays flew away. ‘‘That is just what I was 
looking for,” he said. Straightway he broke the egg, the prince 
died. Bonit’ rubbed grease on the rocks, Flor de Bonit’ and the 
cart were disenchanted. “I was in a deep sleep,” said Flor de 
Bonit’. “Sleep, indeed!’’ said Bonit’, “you have been enchanted

Then the three returned in the cart to the home of Flor ,de 
Bonit’. His father was so charmed by the princess, he planned 
to send his son to the wars and to take her for himself? Flor de 
Bonit’ said to Bonit’, “I arrived but yesterday, and here my father 
wishes to send me to the wars!”— “Let me go in your place,” said 
Bonit’. 
“Help me, sea-horse!” he said, and he asked the devil to turn 
into a horse for him to ride. He rode to the war, he won a vic- 
tory, he returned with the conquered flag. As he came back 
through the woods, he encountered four men the king had sent 
out to meet and kill his son in case he had not been killed fighting. 
The men blinded Bonit’ in one eye, they left him for dead. They 
reported to the king, and the king began to make advances to the 
princess.

He builds an arch in front of his door. As he comes out to meet them, and sees the prin- 
cess, he is so overcome by her looks that he stumbles against the arch and puts out one 
of his eyes. There is nothing further about Flor de Bonit’s father. (Fogo.)

Meanwhile into the wood where Bonit’ lay there flew three 
bluejays.1 “It is too bad he is dead,” said one to the other. 
“Were he alive, he could pick a blossom from this tree, chew it, 
rub it on his eye, recover his sight.” Bonit’ overheard this, he 
did as the bird suggested. He recovered his eyesight, he went on 
to the place where he had left Flor de Bonit’ to wait for him. He 
told him how he had gone to the war, how on his return with the 
flag of victory the king had set four men on him to kill him. “‘If 
my father did this, I will kill him with my own hand,” said Flor 
de Bonit’. 
They all went on living together.2 Flor de Bonit’ and the 
princess were unwilling to have Bonit’ leave them until they had 
a child for him to become its godfather. He staid on, although he 
wanted to go to the city of the prince he had killed. Finally one 
day his godchild called him “crazy godfather,” so he acted crazy, 
and set forth to the city of the dead prince? He disenchanted it, 
he obtained all its wealth. All the wealth in the world is a part 
of that wealth.

There were a man and a woman had a son named Anton. His 
mother reared him shut up, he never saw the light. One night he 
dreamed that a girl passed a handkerchief over this face. He 
awoke, he saw no one. He told his mother what he dreamed. 
His mother said to him, “It is plain what you dreamed, my son, 
you dreamed of something enchanted.” A few days passed, he 
dreamed again the same dream, again he told his mother. His 
mother said to him, “My son, you dream of a girl who lives in the 
tower of the moon with her father.” He began to think how he

3 Variant: Fin’ de Bonit’ says to his comadre, “If I don’t provoke Bonit’ in some way, 
T'll never be able to get away from here to get myself a wife. I’ll make myself a death- 
casket [cochon.]” As he lies in it and they all mourn, his godchild runs up to it. He does 
something to make the child laugh; and the child keeps running to and fro and laughing 
until Bonit’ says, “Stop that! you are like your godfather, just as queer [fascent.!” Then 
Fin’ de Bonit’ arises from the casket, and says, “You ought not to say that.” — “I said it 
because it pained me to have the child act that way with you dead.” — “To-day you call 
me queer, to-morrow you'll call me something else. I’m going away to my own coun- 
try.... I’m poor, and you're rich. You don’t want me.” Here the tale of “The Rich 
Friend and the Poor” is spliced.

could go to the tower of the moon. He started forth. In the 
middle of a field he met an eagle, an ant, a lion, and a dove 
quarrelling over the division of an ox.t He divided it for them. 
The eagle said to him, “Wherever you are in trouble, call for me, 
*O Eagle that flies seven miles without tiring or sweating!’” The 
ant said to him, “Wherever you are in trouble, call for me, ‘O 
Ant that goes where nobody knows!’” The lion said to him, 
“Wherever you are in trouble, call for me, ‘O Lion, king of the 
animals!’ I will save you.” The dove said to him, “Wherever 
you are in trouble, call for me, ‘O Dove that flies seven miles 
without tiring or sweating!’ I will save you.” 
He went, went, went; he came toa place where he did not know 
what to do. Then he called,— 
“Ai, ai! of me, an eagle 
That flies seven miles without tiring or sweating.” 
He turned into an eagle, he flew seven miles without tiring or 
sweating. Hecame to the house of Mother-of-the-Wind. Mother- 
of-the-Wind said to him, “Good-day, my grandson!”—‘Good- 
day, my grandmother!” Mother-of-the-Wind said to him, 
“Why do you come here, a place nobody ever came to before? 
My son is very bad.” He said to her, “I am looking for a girl 
who lives in the tower of the moon.” ‘They heard a noise break- 
ing the trees. It was Wind who was coming home. When he 
arrived, he said, “My mother, I smell royal blood here.”—“No, 
you don’t smell royal blood, because not a creature comes here.” 
Then the boy called; he said,— 
“Ai, ai! of me, an ant 
That goes where nobody knows.” 
1 Variant: On his way [spliced into “The Master Thief”’] he meets several creatures,— 
birds, wolf, elephant, all the animals, with a cow tied up to kill. They are waiting for 
some one to come and kill her and divide her equally among them. He passes on, but 
Elephant sends Falcon after him. He kills the cow, but goes on without dividing her. 
Elephant sends Falcon after him to skin the cow. He returns and skins the cow, and goes 
‘on, Elephant sends Falcon after him to take out the insides of the cow. He returns and 
takes out the insides, and goes on. Elephant says, ‘“‘We had the man with us, and we 
forgot to tell him to make the division. Go bring him back.” He returns, and divides 
the cow into twelve parts. (There were twelve of them,— Elephant, Wolf, Falcon, Crow, 
Bluejay, Minhofo {a bird like a falcon], Nephew, Bilhafre [kite], Franceja [bird], Curtenes 
{quail], Owl, Ant.) After dividing, he leaves. Elephant sends after him. “‘ You divided, 
but you didn’t show us what piece was to go to each of us.” He shows them and leaves. 
Elephant says, ‘We have not expressed our gratitude,” and he sends after him. When he 
comes, Elephant says, ‘Whenever you are in trouble, call on us, and we will help you.”

He turned into an ant. He hid in a crack of the door. Wind 
said, “‘My mother, give me water, I’m thirsty. Give me to eat, 
I’m hungry. Give me my pipe, I want to smoke. I’ve been 
blowing through all the trees and past every house, all over the 
world. I am tired.” Wind drank, he ate, he smoked, he lay 
down. His mother said to him, ‘‘Let me ask you something. Do 
you know the way to the tower of the moon?”-——“I came from 
there about a minute ago. Any one who goes there has to pass 
by the inhabitants of the moon.” Then Wind left to blow again, 
to blow through the world. 
The boy called for Dove; he said,— 
“Ai, ai! of me, a dove 
That flies seven miles without tiring or sweating.” 
He turned into a dove. He flew, flew, until he came to the in- 
habitants of the moon. He saw the tower of the moon. He flew 
to the window; he called for the ant,— 
“Ai, ai! of me, an ant 
That goes where nobody knows.” 
He turned into an ant. He went straight to the girl’s room! 
He said,— 
“Ai, ai! of me, Anton.” 
When he spoke, he turned into a boy. The girl asked him, 
“What are you doing here?” He answered, “‘I have come to get 
you to marry me.”—“TI cannot marry you. My father will not 
let me.”—“If there is no other means, I will take your father’s 
life. Go ask your father where his life is.” He called for the 
ant,— 
“Ai, ai! of me, an ant 
That goes where nobody knows.” 
He went under the man’s bed. The girl came; she asked her 
father, “‘My father, where is your life?” The father said to her, 
“Why do you ask me? It is for some bedevilment.”—“No, I 
only want to know.” He said to her, “My life is inside the belly 
of a hog in my garden. Inside the belly of this hog is an egg. 
Inside this egg is my life.” Then the boy said,— 
“Ai, ai! of me, a boy.”

He turned into a boy. He went to the girl’s room. He said to 
her, “Now I am going to kill that hog. 
“Ai, ai! of me, an eagle 
That flies seven miles without tiring or sweating.” 
He turned into an eagle. He flew to the man’s garden. He 
fought with the hog, he could not get the better of it. So he called 
for the lion; he said,— 
“Ai, ai! of me, a lion, 
King of animals.” 
He turned into a lion. He fought with the hog. As soon as he 
began to fight, the man became sick. The more he beat the hog, 
the sicker became the man. Finally he killed the hog, he opened 
it, he took out the egg, he broke it, the man died. The boy called 
for the dove; he said,— 
“Ai, ai! of me, a dove 
That flies seven miles without tiring or sweating.” 
He became a dove. He flew to the window of the tower, where 
he turned into an ant, he went in. The house was covered with 
black. They buried the man. The boy married the girl. He 
became king of the inhabitants of the moon, and the girl became 
queen. 
75. THE FAITHFUL FRIEND. ! 
There was a woman named Adraga Juliana. She was the pret- 
tiest woman in the world. There was a king’s son. He had a 
servant who grew up with him, named Pedr’. Pedr’ and the 
prince loved each other like brothers. One night the prince 
dreamed about Adraga Juliana. The next day they took him 
breakfast, he did not eat breakfast. They took him dinner, he 
did not eat dinner. They took him supper, he did not eat supper. 
Pedr’ asked him what was the matter with him. The prince 
answered, “Last night I dreamed of Adraga Juliana. I do not 
know where I can find her.” Pedr’ replied, “We will start 
through the world to look until we find her.” They started, they 
went until they came to two cross-roads. Pedr’ went by one road; 
the prince, by the other. In two days the prince met Adraga

Juliana. He returned to the cross-roads, where he found Pedr’ 
waiting for him. The prince said to Pedr’, “This is the woman 
I am going to marry.” 
They took the road back. On their way they lay down under a 
pine-tree. Pedr’ was on guard. At midnight a bird flew, one 
wing to the sea, one wing to the mountains! The prince and 
Adraga Juliana were asleep, Pedr’ staid awake. He heard the 
bird say, “To-morrow on their way they will pass by a grape-vine 
and ripe grapes. If Adraga Juliana eats, she will die. Whoever 
hears and tells will turn to marble to the knees.” The bird flew 
off, he came back; he said, “On their road they will pass by an 
apple-tree with very ripe apples. If Adraga Juliana eats, she will 
die. Whoever hears and tells will turn to marble to the waist.” 
The bird flew off, he came back; he said, “To-morrow on their 
road they will come across a very clear spring. If Adraga Juli- 
ana drinks, she will die. Whoever hears and tells will turn to 
marble to the neck. If she escapes this, on the day of her mar- 
riage a dragon will come and lie under the bed, and kill her and her 
bridegroom.” Pedr’ heard all this, but he said nothing to the 
others. They rose, they took the road, the prince and Juliana on 
horseback together, Pedr’ by himself. They passed by a grape- 
vine with ripe grapes. Adraga Juliana said, “Oh, what ripe 
grapes! Give me a bunch.” The prince started to dismount. 
Pedr’ said he would dismount. “You are two; let me dismount, 
I am but one.” He went and got the poorest bunch there. He 
took them to Juliana. Juliana said to him,? “I do not care for 
these.” 
They went, went, went. They came to an apple-tree with very 
ripe apples. Adraga Juliana said, “Oh, what ripe apples! Give 
me one.” The prince started to dismount. Pedr’ said he would 
dismount. “You are two; let me dismount, I am but one.” 
He went and took the poorest apple there. He took it to Juliana. 
Juliana declined it. She said to him, “I do not care for it.” She 
said to the prince, “You say that Pedr’ is your friend; but I do 
not think so. See how, with all those ripe apples, he brings me 
the poorest that is there!” 
They went, went, went. They came to a very clear spring. 
Adraga Juliana said, “Oh, what very clear water! Give me a

” drink.” The prince started to dismount to go and get it. Pedr’ 
said he would dismount. “You are two; let me dismount, I am 
but one.” [There was a golden cup hanging on a tree, also a 
gourd.] He went and muddied the water. He took some very 
muddy water in the gourd. Juliana declined it. 
When they reached home, they went to get married, but Pedr’ 
took little interest in their getting married. He staid at home, 
he sharpened his sword. The prince was hurt; he said, “Pedr’, 
you act as if you did not want.me to marry.” Pedr’ answered, 
“No, that’s not so. I helped you get a wife, by and by you will 
help me too.” On the morning of the wedding, Pedr’ staid at 
home, he made out he was sick. When they went to the church, 
he put his sword under the bridal bed. When they came home, 
they went to bed, they went to sleep, Pedr’ staid awake. At 
midnight he felt the ground shake thrice, the dragon appeared 
with its mouth open to kill the two of them. Pedr’ took his 
sword, he cut off the dragon’s head. A drop of blood spurted 
on to the face of Juliana. Pedr’ said to himself, “If I take it off 
her with the point of the sword, she might wake up, the sword 
might wound her. I will lick it off her with my tongue He 
went to lick it; Juliana was frightened, she cried out. She said 
to the prince, “See now what I told you, Pedr’ is not your friend. 
See what he was about to do to us!” 
The prince sent word to his father what Pedr’ was about to do 
to him, in order that the king might order Pedr’ sent to the gallows. 
Pedr’ begged the king to send for the priest for him to confess 
before he died. The king sent for the priest. When the priest 
came, Pedr’ began to confess. He said, “One night on our road 
the prince and Juliana lay down to sleep. I staid awake. At 
midnight there came by a bird, one wing to the sea, one wing to 
the mountains. The bird said, ‘To-morrow on their way they 
will pass by a ripe grape-vine. Whoever eats from it will die. 
Whoever hears this and tells will turn to a marble stone to the 
knees.’ When we came [to it], the prince started to dismount 
to go and get some, I went and got some. I got some of the 
poorest. Adraga Juliana did not want them. She threw them 
away.” Pedr’ became a marble stone to the knees. He said, 
“We came past a ripe apple-tree. The prince started to get 
{an apple], I went and got one. I got one of the poorest which

was there, I took it to her. Adraga did not want it, she threw it 
away.” Pedr’ became a marble stone to the waist. “‘We passed 
by a spring of water so clear, Adraga Juliana asked for a drink. 
The prince started to go and get it, I went and got it. I muddied 
the water. When I took it to her, Adraga Juliana did not want it, 
she threw it away, because there were hanging there in the tree 
two cups, one of gold, one a gourd. I took the gourd cup, which 
she did not want.” He became a marble stone to his neck. 
“‘When we reached the house, I sharpened my sword, I did not 
concern myself much with the wedding. The prince noticed the 
difference. He said, ‘Pedr’, you seem not to like my marrying.’ 
To which I said, ‘No, that’s not so. I helped you get a wife, 
later on you will help me too.’ J sharpened my sword. I put it 
under the bed for me to kill the dragon which would come to kill 
you [them] both. You [they] lay down to sleep. At midnight, 
when the dragon came, I cut offits head. A drop of blood spurted 
and fell on the face of Adraga Juliana. I thought if I took it off 
her with the point of my sword, she might be frightened, wounded, 
I went to lick it off her, she woke up.” He became a marble 
stone to his head. As soon as he started to tell that he would 
become a marble stone to his knees, the priest told him not to say 
anything more. He said, “What sort of a man is he who is stone. 
to his knees, and from there up a person?” He told it all, to the 
very end. 
The prince left, and went to a said’. He asked him what was 
able to turn Pedr’ into a man. The said’ said to him, “The only 
thing to turn him back is the blood of your first child. Cut off 
its head,} collect the blood in a bowl, wash the stone with it, it 
will become a person.” The prince went home, he told his wife. 
His wife refused to kill her child. The prince said to her, “We 
have to kill it. Pedr’ is our best friend. God gave us this child, 
he can give us another; but a friend like Pedr’ we shall not find.” 
When the child was born, the prince cut its neck. He collected 
the blood in a bowl. He threw the corpse into a room. He went 
and washed the stone with the blood. The stone became a 
person. Fine as Pedr’ was, now he was finer than ever. They 
had a feast for three days. During the three days they forgot 
about the child. When they remembered, they went to the door 
of the room where they threw the body to bury it. When they

reached the door, the prince told his wife to open the door. His 
wife said to him, “You open it.” They heard a voice say inside 
of the room, “At any rate, one of you open the door, because I am 
hungry. I have been three days without food.” Then they gave 
another feast for thirty days, so glad were they to have saved both 
child and friend. 
(Variant a.) 
There was a king had aroyal son. The day the prince married, 
his cousin also: took a wife home. The day the wife of the prince 
lay in, the wife of the cousin lay in too. The two children they 
put into one house. One was called Prince, the other was named 
Good-Friend. One night Prince dreamed of Juliana the 
Enchanted. He did not eat, he did not drink. He said that he 
would not.eat, he would not drink, if he did not see her. His 
grandmother told him to eat, she would let him see her. She 
gave him a bottle of sweet-oil, and a steamboat to keep running till 
he wished to pour out the oil, He ran for seven days. On the 
ninth day, at seven o’clock, he took the bottle, he poured [its 
contents] into the sea. As soon as the bottle was dry, he was at 
the dock near the girl’s house. Then he went with the girl. - In 
the afternoon he told Good-Friend to take the sword, because he 
was sleepy; two nights he had not slept. When night came on, 
two birds alighted,— one on the prow, one on the stern. One 
bird said to the other, “Whatever pleasure the prince takes in 
our sister, he will not enjoy her.” [The other] said, ‘““Why?”— 
“Because the day he enters the door of the king, the tame dragon 
of the king will frighten her. He will kill it only if there appears 
somebody to kill him. She will escape; but whoever hears this 
story and relates it will turn into a marble stone.” The next 
night the birds came back, alighted, [and one of them] said, “‘My 
sister, what did I tell you?” The other said, ‘What did you tell 
me?”—“T told you that he would not enjoy our sister, because 
she would give birth in seven months, he will say that it is not his 
son, and whoever hears [and] tells will turn into a marble stone.” 
The birds flew away. 
When they arrived, he killed the dragon. They did not stay 
happy, because they said that they did not like it. Well, the 
woman came to give birth at seven months. The prince said that 
it was not his son, it was the son of his good friend. Then

Good-Friend began to relate. He told all that had happened in 
connection with the birds; and he became a marble stone from 
foot to knee, to waist, to head. Then he was very impatient. 
He went to do business. Business was good, he made a lot of 
money. He went to see the said’. He began to tell the said’ 
about his wife. The said’ told him, if he wanted his friend to 
revive, to take a black cat, take out a tuft from the tail, take two 
white plates, to kill it, then for them to take the child, cut him up 
joint by joint, put the face in one plate, the blood in the other, and 
let the last piece fall over the uncovered stone foot of Good-Friend. 
They wrapped it in a sheet, put it intoa room. They went to rub 
. the blood on the stone with the tuft, Good-Friend revived; they 
started a dance for six months. After they amused themselves 
for six months, they said, “Better let us bury our son, who died 
yesterday.” When they opened the door of the room, they found 
the child playing with flowers. Those flowers were the ones which 
bore the seeds which produced all the plants in the world to-day. 
76.3 THE HAIR LADDER: THE FAITHFUL FRIEND. 
There were two friends, one rich and one poor. Wherever 
Rich-Friend went, he took with him his poor friend. One day it 
happened that he went hunting alone. He passed by a house; 
he heard a voice saying, ““Adraga Juliana, Adraga Juliana, drop 
down your hair, I am coming up!” Rich-Friend looked every- 
where, he saw no way of reaching the window in that house. He 
went home; he said to his poor friend, “ Poor-Friend, I have found 
something I am going to get for us both.” He went back to the 
house. He called out, “Adraga Juliana, Adraga Juliana, drop 
down your hair, Iam coming up!” The girl did not look through 
the window; she threw down her hair, just as she did for her 
mother. He climbed up. He played with the girl, As he 
played, he pulled out one of her hairs. When her mother came, 
she counted her daughter’s hairs, as she was accustomed to count 
them. She found one hair missing. She said, “Daughter, one 
of your hairs is missing.” _ The girl answered, “I was playing with 
my little cat, she took one of my hairs.”” The mother killed the 
little cat. The next day Rich-Friend came again; he called,

“Adraga Juliana, Adraga Juliana, drop down your hair, I am 
coming up!” As he played with her, he took another hair. The 
girl said to him, “What shall I do? My mother told me that if 
she found another hair missing, she would kill me.” He said to 
her, “Come with me.”’ She said to him, “No, I have a little pig 
here. When she asks me, I will tell her that my little pig pulled 
it from me.” When her mother came, she counted her hairs. 
She found another hair missing. Her daughter said to her, “TI 
was playing with my little pig. He pulled it from me.” Next 
day Rich-Friend asked his poor friend to accompany him to the 
house. When they arrived, Rich-Friend said, “Adraga Juliana, 
Adraga Juliana, drop down your hair, Iam coming up!” She 
dropped it down, he went up. As he played with her, he pulled 
out another hair. The girl did not know what to say about it, 
she did not know what to tell her mother. She fled with him. 
When her mother came, she called; nobody answered her. Then 
her mother put this curse on her: “O my daughter! you will pass 
by a pool of clear water. If he drinks from it, he will break like 
glass. Whoever hears this and tells it will turn into a marble 
stone to the knees. If he escapes this, he will pass by an orange- 
tree. If he eats an orange, he will break like glass. Whoever 
hears this and tells it will turn into a marble stone to the waist. 
If he escapes this, when he reaches home, the house will fall on the 
two of them and kill them.! Whoever hears this and tells it will 
turn into a marble stone to the neck. If they escape from this, 
the night of their wedding a dragon will kill them both. Whoever 
hears this and tells it will turn into a marble stone to the head.” 
Meanwhile the three went on until they came to a tree, where 
Juliana and Rich-Friend lay down to sleep. Poor-Friend kept 
awake to guard them. In the middle of the night, at one o’clock, 
two birds flew by.2 One said, “Good-night, Comadre!” The 
other answered, ‘‘Good-night, Comadre! What news?” He 
answered, “The news is not good.” —‘‘ What is it??? And Poor- 
Friend was listening. The bird said to the other, “The news is

that Juliana’s mother has put this curse upon her: ‘O my daugh- 
ter! he with whom you went will pass by a pool of clear water. 
If he drinks, he will break like glass. Whoever hears this and 
tells it will turn into a marble stone to the knees. If he escapes 
from this, he will pass by an orange-tree with ripe oranges. . If he 
eats one, he will break like glass. Whoever hears this and tells it 
will turn into a marble stone to the waist. If he escapes from this, 
the day he reaches home the house will fall on the two of them and 
kill them. Whoever hears this and tells it will turn into a marble 
stone to the neck. If they escape from this, the day of their 
wedding, at night, a dragon will kill them both. Whoever hears 
this and tells it will turn into a marble stone to the head.’” 
Poor-Friend heard all this. He said, “What shall I do to save these 
two?” When they woke up, they said to Poor-Friend, “You ride 
now, you let us go afoot.” He answered, ‘“‘No, not for anything 
in this world. I am going to serve you until we reach home.”’ 
They started; on the way Juliana saw a pool of clear water. She 
said, “Oh, I’m thirsty!” Rich-Friend started to get water for her. 
Poor-Friend said to him, “If one of us has to go, let me go! Iam 
but one.” He went, he muddied the water, he took her the 
muddy water full of worms. She said, “J do not need the water.” 
They went, went, went; they came to an orange-tree with very 
ripe oranges. Rich-Friend started to pick an orange for Juliana. 
Poor-Friend said to him, “Let me go! it is easier for me afoot than 
for you ahorse.” He went, he picked a green orange, and the 
poorest that was there; he took it to Juliana. She said, ‘Throw 
it on the ground, I do not want it.—With so many fine ripe 
oranges there, he brought me the poorest.” They went on. 
When they were near home, Poor-Friend said to them, “You wait 
here. I will go on ahead, I will see if the house is ready for you.” 
He went on: he said to the king, “If you want to see your son 
alive, tear down this house, and in four hours build it up again.” 
(The house had to fall down once, because of the curse.) The 
king tore down the house, in four hours he built it up again. 
When they reached home, Rich-Friend said to Poor-Friend, 
“Juliana is our sister, neither I nor you will marry her. When we 
go out, we will leave her to cook for us.” Poor-Friend said to 
him, “No, marry her. I will wait on you as a servant.” They 
married. Poor-Friend took his sword, he sharpened it to such an 
edge that a fly alighting on it would be split in two. For two 
years he guarded them, and watched for the dragon. Well, one

night, when their son was a year old, Poor-Friend felt something 
coming through. the window. It was the dragon. He took his 
sword, he cut off its head. A drop of blood dropped on Juliana’s 
face. Poor-Friend said, “She ought not to wake up with that 
blood on her face.” He said, “If I take it off her with the point 
of my sword, she might be frightened, it might wound her, I will 
lick it off with my tongue.” He began to lick it offher. Juliana 
woke up, she saw Poor-Friend, she screamed; she said to Rich- 
Friend, “See. Poor-Friend standing, sword in hand!” Rich- 
Friend said to him, ‘‘Poor-Friend, you are false. I told you that 
neither of us would marry her, we would make her our sister, 
you insisted I marry her, now you come to kill us both.” Poor- 
Friend said, “Rich-Friend, don’t be angry! I will tell you all 
about it. You remember the night you left with Juliana?”— 
“Yes, I remember.” —“‘You remember the night you lay down 
under a tree?”—“Yes, I remember.’’—‘‘That night two birds 
passed by; one said to the other, ‘What news?’ The other 
answered, ‘Bad news. Juliana’s mother has laid a curse upon her: 
“O my daughter! you go with pleasure; but when you pass by a 
pool of clear water, whoever drinks of it will break like glass. 
Whoever hears this and tells it will turn into a marble stone to the 
knees.”’”’ Poor-Friend turned into a marble stone to his knees. 
Rich-Friend begged Poor-Friend not to tell more. Poor-Friend 
said to him, “I am going to finish telling it. What is a man stone 
to the knees, from there up a person? She said, ‘If he escapes 
from this, he will come to a very ripe orange-tree, whoever eats 
will break like glass. Whoever hears this and tells it will turn 
into a marble stone to the waist.’” He turned into stone to the 
waist. Rich-Friend begged, “Don’t tell it! Stay as you are, at 
least I'll have you to talk to.” Poor-Friend answered, “I am 
going to finish telling it. Let me be either stone or man.” He 
went on to finish telling it. ‘She said, ‘If he escapes from this, 
when he reaches home, the house will fall on them and kill the two 
of them. Whoever hears this and tells it will turn into a marble 
stone to the neck.’” He turned into a marble stone to the neck. 
“And if he escapes from this, the day of their wedding, at night, 
a dragon will come and kill them both. Whoever hears and tells 
it will turn into a marble stone to the head.” The dragon came, I 
killed it, a drop of its blood spurted and fell on Juliana’s face. I 
started to take it off with the point of my sword. I thought she 
might be frightened, it might wound her, I licked it off her with my

tongue. You woke up, you found me there.” With these words 
Poor-Friend turned into a marble stone to his head. 
They stood him up, a stone figure, at the street door. Every 
morning when they got up, before they washed or ate, they went 
before him, they sat down, they wept. Every morning for twelve 
years they did this. Then one morning, as they were weeping, a 
bluejay passed by. Bluejay sang, he asked him why he was 
crying. Rich-Friend said to Bluejay, “This stone figure is my 
best friend. I have to weep over him every morning until I die.” 
Bluejay said to him, ‘“‘This is nothing. Take your son and cut 
off his head. Let his blood run over this stone, you will see your 
friend again as he was in the flesh.” Rich-Friend went and told 
his wife what Bluejay had said to him. His wife answered, 
“Kill him as quickly as you can. We can have another child, 
but we cannot have another friend like this.” They took the boy, 
they cut off his head. They let the blood run over the stone 
figure. Poor-Friend became again the man he was. They made 
a feast and a dance of joy for three days. They forgot about the 
body of the child. When they remembered, they went into the 
room where the body of the child was, to bury it. When they 
opened the door, they saw the boy standing there alive, and 
dressed in priest’s vestments, ready to go to say mass.

77. THE POOR FRIEND AND THE RICH.4 
There were two friends, one rich, the other poor. One was 
called Bonit’; the other, Fin’ di Bonit’?. They were compadres. 
Bonit’ was poor, Fin’ di Bonit’ was rich. Bonit’ wanted to test 
his compadre, Fin’ di Bonit’. He made a form of marble to the

knees, in it he put his legs. He said to Fin’ di Bonit’, “I am going 
to die, I have no way that you can help me.” [Fin’ di Bonit’] 
said to him, “I'll give you any money whatever to help you.” 
Bonit’ said to him, “Kill your child. Don’t let a drop of blood 
fall to the ground, rub the blood over me, that will cure me.” 
Fin’ di Bonit’ said to his wife, “I am going to kill our son, because 
our compadre is sick, the blood of our child is the only remedy 
which will cure him.” He killed his son, he put him in a casket, 
he took the blood, he carried it to the man. After he put the 
blood on the legs of his compadre, he saw him getting better. 
Bonit’ said to him, “‘You did not do right to kill your son for me, 
because I am mature, I have lived my life. His life was to come.” 
As they began to talk, they heard the voice of a child crying. 
In that place there was no other child. ‘How is it we hear the 
crying of a child?” Fin’ di Bonit’ answered, “It is not the crying 
of a child.” But Bonit’ insisted. Fin’ di Bonit’ said to him, 
“Tt’s your nonsense.” He answered, “‘Compadre, we can’t go on 
living together. I heard a child cry, you said that it was my 
nonsense. We can’t go on living together.” He said to him, 
“Compadre, a little while ago you talked of my nonsense, we are 
still living together. To-day I talk of your nonsense, you are 
angry. And that is because you are rich.”—‘‘Compadre, if I had 
left you in that country where they were going to kill you, you 
would not be talking of my nonsense to-day.”—‘‘ Compadre, if I 
had left you in that enchanted land, you would not be here to-day. 
It shows that money can’t do everything.” —“Death is no more 
than death. You saved me, I saved you. You did that for me, 
I did as much for you. I do not like you to throw it in my face.” 
—“T’m going to move from your house. If I owe, I’ll pay; if I 
don’t owe, I will not pay.” Fin’ di Bonit’ said to him, “If you 
ate going to pay, we are going to pay together.” He insisted on 
going with his compadre and friend. 
They went, went, went, until Fin’ di Bonit’ said, “Compadre, I 
am thirsty.” He said to him, “Have you no money in your 
pocket?” —“Yes, sir.” —“‘Put money in your mouth, see if it will 
kill your thirst.” They went, went, went, until Fin’ di Bonit’ 
said to him, “ Compadre, I am hungry.”—“Have you paper money 
in your pocket?” —“ Yes.” —“ Eat it, see if it will kill your hunger.” 
They went, went, went; Fin’ di Bonit’ said to him, “Compadre, I 
am tired.” He said to him, “Have you plenty of money in your 
pocket?” —“Yes, sir.” —“Take it out, see if it will rest you.”

Meanwhile the child grew up until he became knowing. He 
said to his mother, “I am going to set out and go until I find my 
father and my godfather.” He went, went, went, until he got 
thirsty. He found water, he drank. He went, went, went, until 
he got hungry. He found a house, they gave him to eat. He 
went, went, went, until he got tired. It was a dark night, he sat 
down by the roadside. He heard a voice saying, ‘““O God! here 
am I about to die of thirst and hunger, with plenty of money in 
my pocket.” Another voice said, “If you have faith, you will 
not die.” Then the child saw the two men. They asked him 
where he was going. The child said to them, “I am looking for 
my father and my godfather.”——“You have no money?”— He 
answered, ‘‘No;. but since I left, I have eaten and drunk.” Fin’ 
di Bonit’ said to him, “I have money, but I have nothing to eat 
or drink.” The child said to him, “I went with faith, I have eaten 
and drunk. If you went with faith, you too would have eaten 
and drunk.” Bonit’ said to him, “You see what I told you? 
Money is nothing. If you owe, you will pay; if you don’t owe, 
you will not pay.” He turned to the child; he said, “That’s 
your father, I am your godfather. I have no money, but I am 
not thirsty or hungry or tired. He has plenty of money, but he 
is thirsty and hungry and tired.” Then Fin’ di Bonit’ took out all 
the money he had in his pockets. They all turned back home. 
When they reached home, his wife embraced him, she embraced 
his compadre too. Bonit’ sat down by his wife, he let his com- 
padre sit by her too. Even yesterday I went there, I saw them 
as contented as ever. I went there to pay him a debt I owed him. 
He said, “Money! money! if you mention money in my house, I 
will kill you.” 
78. BROTHER AND SISTER? 
There was a woman had two children,—one called Constan- 
tina Miraculous, the other called Manuel. Their mother died. 
Manuel said to his sister, “You stay at home, and I will go into 
the world to make a living.” Constantina gave him a handker- 
chief on which was written, ““Constantina; when she weeps, the 
’ rain falls; when she laughs, the sun shines; when she combs her 
hair, mirasol? drop to the ground; when she washes her hands,

2 tainha) drop.” Manuel set out. He went to another country, 
where in the king’s house he found work. One day he was in the 
courtyard, he took out his handkerchief to wipe his face. The 
king saw it, he asked what it was. ‘‘It is a handkerchief which 
my sister gave me.” —“‘ What is the name on it?” —“‘Constantina; 
when she weeps, the rain falls; when she laughs, the sun shines; 
when she combs her hair, mirasol drop to the ground; when she 
washes her hands, sainha drop.” The king was a widower. He 
said to Manuel, “If your sister has all these charms,? fetch her, I 
will marry her, I will make you rich.” Manuel said to him, “I 
will go for her.” The king said to him, “‘I will give you four war- 
ships for you to fetch her.” —“‘No, I want only one ship to bring 
her in.” Manuel went home; he said to Constantina, “My 
sister, we are poor, but I have found a husband for you.”—“ Very 
well; if you say so, I’ll go with you.” 
With his sister he took also her godmother and her daughter 
Constancia. Her godmother was a witch. After they had gotten 
in mid-seas, she made the ship stop. Constantina was in the 
cabin; Manuel, at the wheel. He called out to Constantina; he 
said, “Work a miracle, and let our ship sail on!” Constantina 
asked, “What did my brother say?” Her godmother said to her, 
“He said I should cut off one of your legs and cast it into the sea.” 
—‘Tf my brother said so, cut it off.” She cut it off, she threw it 
into the sea. The calm continued. Manuel called out again; 
he said, “Constantina Miraculous, work a miracle, and let our 
ship sail on!” Constantina asked, “‘What did my brother say?” 
Her godmother said to her, ‘“‘He said to cut off your other leg and 
cast it into the sea.”—“‘If my brother said so, cut it off.” Manuel 
called again. Her godmother said to her, ““He said for me to cut 
off your right arm and cast it into the sea.” He called again. 
Her godmother said to her, “He said for me to cut off your left 
arm and cast it into the sea.” He called again. Her godmother 
said to her, “(He said for me to cast you into the sea.”—“If my 
brother said so, throw me into the sea.” Before she cast her away, 
she took out both her eyeballs. She was blind. As soon as 
Constantina rested on the sea, the wind became favorable, they 
made land. Manuel went to the cabin to tell Constantina to 
dress to go ashore. He asked, “Where is Constantina?” Her 
godmother said to him, “‘She fell into the sea. We did not tell

you, not to grieve you.”—“O God! What shall I do?” His 
contract with the king was that if he brought his sister, he would 
marry her; if he did not bring her, he would kill him. Her god- 
mother said to him, “This is nothing. Take my daughter for him 
to marry.” The contract also was that the king marry the 
woman Manuel brought. When the king saw Constancia, he 
did not like her. She was ugly. The king said to him, “Is this 
Constantina Miraculous?”—“‘Yes, this is Constantina Miracu- 
lous.” The king said to her, ‘‘Constantina Miraculous, cry.”” 
Constancia answered, “I don’t know how to cry.” —‘‘Constantina 
Miraculous, laugh.”—“I don’t know how to laugh.”—‘‘Con- 
stantina Miraculous, comb your hair.” —“I have no hair.” —“ Con- 
stantina Miraculous, wash your hands.”—‘I don’t much like to 
wash my hands.” Then the king turned to Manuel; he said, 
“Man, you have made a fool of me. Enjoy yourself for six days, 
then I am going to imprison you for life.” For three days Manuel 
grieved by the side of the sea. 
Now, when the pieces of Constantina dropped into the sea, an 
enchanted whale took them, he united them all, he restored every- 
thing to its place, only the eyes were missing. So Whale sent an 
angel to the city to say, ‘Who wants to buy mirasol for two eyes, 
two big eyes?” The godmother heard; she said to her daughter, 
“Take those two eyes and exchange them for mirasol.” She 
exchanged them. The angel took the eyes, Whale put them into 
the head of Constantina Miraculous. Then he put a golden chain 
around her waist, he pulled her to the shore. 
A man was standing by the side of the sea. Constantina 
Miraculous told the man to run quickly to the jeweller to get a 
saw to cut through the chain. Meanwhile Whale began to groan, 
she was jumping up, she was thrashing about. Manuel took 
Constantina to his room. Then he went to the king. He asked 
him if he had any garment or towel to mark with Constantina’s 
name; “‘when she weeps, the rain falls; when she laughs, the sun 
shines; when she combs her hair, miraso/ drop to the ground; when 
she washes her hands, ainha drop.”. .. Manuel took the shirt to 
the king. The king said to him, “With only three days to be out, 
you begin on your old asininity again.” When the time was up, 
the king sent a soldier to get Manuel. When the soldier came 
and saw Constantina, he fell on his knees, his hands in prayer. 
Constantina said to him, “Rise. I am a sinner like you.” The 
soldier went to the king, and said that Manuel had with him one

who was perhaps a woman, perhaps a saint. The king went him- 
self, he too kneeled before Constantina. Constantina took his 
hand, she raised him up. Manuel said to him, “This is my sister, 
she who marked your shirt.” The king said to her, “‘Constan- 
tina Miraculous, weep.” She wept, the rain fell. (Like last 
night.) “Constantina Miraculous, laugh.” She laughed, the 
sun shone to dry up the ground. “Constantina Miraculous, 
comb your hair.” She combed her hair, miraso/ dropped to the 
ground. “Constantina Miraculous, wash your hands.” She 
washed her hands. The king looked out the window, he saw 
them [fish] jump in the river. On this very day the king was to 
marry Constancia. He said, “‘This marriage will be with Con- 
stantina; Constancia we'll settle when we get home.” When 
they reached home, the king asked Constantina what she wanted 
done with Constancia. “Let her be burned to ashes, put the 
ashes into a sack, put the sack by the door for me to tread on 
every morning.” 
79. THE USURPER! 
There was a king who had a daughter. There was a boy who 
was a sport (silensios). The boy passed by the king’s house 
every day to see a girl he had somewhere else. The king’s 
daughter saw him every day. One fine day when the boy was 
coming (she was in love with him), she tied a note on a thread 
and dropped it to the street. In the note she told him she loved 
him very much and wanted to talk with him. This day a leper, 
a beggar, passed by where the note was. He learned all that was 
in the note. She had written that she wanted him to be at the 
palace at nine at night. The leper went to beg, he got ten centavos. 
He went to a store and bought some wrapping-paper. He took 
it to the tailor to make him a suit. (The other had on a white 
suit.) After he put on his paper clothes, he came to the palace at 
half-past eight. The girl saw him. She didn’t notice any differ- 
ence, she dropped the rope, the leper went up. There were seven 
rooms, she had the keys to all. She opened door after door till 
she came to her room. The leper asked her not to make a light. 
He lay in bed with the princess, she thought it was the boy she 
liked. At two in the morning she said to him, “It is time to get 
up, so that no one will know you are here.” He said, “No, I’m 
not going to get up.”-——“‘ You must get up. I am the daughter of

a king, and I cannot do anything like this.” The king and queen 
were in another room. The king got up to take a bath. The 
leper would not get up. She went to her mother and told her that 
a leper was in the house insulting her. The queen was overcome 
when she saw the leper in her daughter’s bed. She told the 
servant to go tell the king. The king came with a loaded gun. 
The leper was sitting at the door of the girl’s room. He said to 
the king, “I know this is the last day of my life. Iam a leper, and 
I sit here in this room. But consider. Do you see any door or 
window broken? You see no window or door open. I came here 
to sleep in your daughter’s bed according to an agreement we 
have had for some time.” The king said to his daughter, ‘‘Prob- 
ably that is true. There are seven rooms and seven doors, you 
have the key to all. You probably called him in. I can’t kill 
you, because you are my daughter. All I can do is to marry you 
to this leper, because you called him in.” The king took him and 
the girl, and dressed them out with jewels, he married them at 
church. The leper came back and lived in the house as a son of 
the house (fi/h’ de casa). They lived a life new, a new life (vida 
nov’ e nova vida), just as you can live with your wife if you have 
one. 
(Variant a.) 
‘There was an old sailor nobody wanted. He begged a captain 
to engage him, and at last the captain agreed. Theold sailor went 
ashore, he got drunk. As he stood leaning drowsily against a wall, 
he heard a voice from above saying, “This is not the hour; the 
hour is from eleven to twelve.” He waited to see what would 
happen. After eleven a bundle was let down by arope. It was a 
bundle of clothes. He took them, he put them on. The captain 
wanted to know where he had got the clothes. At last he told the 
captain. It was the captain’s daughter who was letting those 
things down for another man.

There was a priest, he was a bad priest, they unfrocked him. 
He went forth from the city to where nobody lived. There was also 
a marine who had been wrecked. He took to the mountains.

There was also a soldier who had served his time and had nothing 
to do. He started to tramp through the country. The marine 
met the priest. He asked him where he was going. The priest 
answered, ‘I have nothing to do, I have no profession.” —“I too, 
Ihave nothing todo. Let’s go together!” They went, they met 
the soldier, they asked him to go along with them. They went on, 
they saw three girls coming towards them. The soldier said to 
the priest, “If they speak to us, we will answer; if they do not 
speak to us, neither will we speak to them.” The girls came by, 
they passed without speaking. After they passed, they turned, 
they asked the men what were their professions. The priest 
answered, “I was a priest. They unfrocked me.” The marine 
answered, “I was a marine. I was wrecked.” ‘The soldier 
answered, “I was a soldier. I served out my time.” The first 
girl said to the priest, ““You are a priest. You cannot do any- 
thing else. I will give you a pocket-book which, whenever you 
open it, will be full of money.” The second girl said to the 
marine, “You are a sailor. Sometimes you are on water, some- 
times you are on land. I will give you a cloth. Wherever you 
spread it, it will equip a table for you full of all kinds of food.” 
The third girl said to the soldier, “You are a soldier. I will give 
you a flute which, wherever you blow on it, will bring to your side 
ail the soldiers you need.” The girls went their way. 
The men went to the city. There the priest hired a house. He 
got aservant. Whenever he wanted to send to buy anything, he 
opened his pocket-book. Well, one day the marine came to see 
him. He said to him, “I am going to sea. Exchange your 
pocket-book for my cloth.” He exchanged it. Then he went to 
the soldier. He said to him, “Exchange your flute for my pocket- 
book, because the pocket-book is better for you.” As soon as he 
gave him the flute, he blew on it, a squad of soldiers gathered. He 
said to them, “Take that pocket-book away from that man. It is 
from me he stole it.” They took the pocket-book. He went to 
the home of the priest. He blew on his flute, the soldiers gathered. 
He said to them, “Take that cloth away from that man. It is 
from me he stole it.” 
With the three things he left, he went to another city. He blew 
on his flute, the soldiers gathered. He said to them, “Make me 
a palace like the king’s.” They made him a palace over night. 
In the morning he got up, he sat himself down on his verandah. 
To every one who came to see him he gave a gold piece of ten

dollars. The king gave only a patac’. The princess heard of this. 
She told the king to invite him to dinner to find out who he was. 
The king invited him. When he came, the princess asked, 
“Where do you come from?” He answered, “I left my own 
country when I was a child.” —‘‘How do you come to give away 
alms in such sums?”—‘‘I have a pocket-book which, no matter 
what I take out of it, is never empty.” The princess gave him a 
kiss. She asked him to give her his pocket-book. He gave it to 
her. The next day they invited him again to the palace. The 
princess asked him how he got on in the palace without servants. 
He told her about the cloth. The princess asked him to show it to 
her. He spread out the cloth. He said, “Cloth, be furnished.” 
There appeared a table spread with everything. The princess 
gave him a kiss. She told him to give her his cloth.... The 
next day he came to the palace. The princess asked him, “What 
do you do when you need somebody to work for you?”—“TI blow 
on my flute. They come and work for me.” The princess said 
to him, “Try it, and let me see.”” He blew it. There appeared 
a troop of soldiers. The princess gave him a kiss. She told him 
to give her his flute. He gave it to her. The next day he had 
nothing to eat, and no money to give away. He felt ashamed. 
He left the city. 
He passed by a fig-tree bearing on top some very fine figs. He 
climbed to the top to get the figs. As soon as he began to eat the 
figs, a sheep’s horn grew out from his head. To get down from 
the tree he had to catch hold of a branch and drop, because the 
horn was already so big. He said to himself, “This is a punish- 
ment God gives me for what I did to the priest and the soldier.” 
He went on and on. From the weight of the horn on his head he 
was tired: He saw some green grass in the rocks. He said, 
“Surely there is water there to drink.” He went, and found a 
spring of water. As soon as he began to drink, to his great satis- 
faction his horn dropped off. He sat down and thought. Then 
he gathered grass, he made a basket. He returned to the fig-tree, 
he filled his basket with figs. He passed by the king’s house. He 
began to call out, “Who wants to buy May figs?” (Figs are 
scarce in the month of May.) The servant asked the queen if 
she wanted to buy figs. The queen told her to buy them for five 
hundred reds. The servant bought, she made a fig sweet for 
dessert for the family. The next morning, when the king, queen, 
and princess got up, each of them got up with two big horns.

They were so ashamed, they did not know what to do. The 
doctor they sent for said he could not operate, because the horns 
grew from the bone. They spent their money in vain, and finally 
they posted a notice that any one with experience might try to 
cure them. The marine read this notice. He filled a bottle with 
water from that spring. He said to the king, “To cure you, I 
have to whip you twenty times, in order to cut the root of that 
horn.” As soon as he began to whip, the king began to cry out, 
but he did not stop. He gave him a cup of water, the horns 
dropped off. The king called the queen. He stripped her naked, 
he whipped her too. He gave her a cup of water, the horns fell 
off. The king called the princess. When she came, first she 
objected, but later she consented to strip for him to whip her. 
The marine said to her, ““Your punishment is harder than that 
of the others, because you are younger, your horn is stronger.” 
He gave her thirty-five strokes. He said to her, “God sent me 
here to punish you, because of a poor man whose flute you took, 
and cloth, and pocket-book. He sent me to get them from you.” 
The princess refused to give them to him until he gave her twenty- 
five more strokes. Then he gave her a cup of water, and her 
horns dropped off. He blew on his flute. The soldiers gathered. 
He told them to kill the king, the queen, and the princess, to make 
him king over that country. 
81. AS BROAD AS HE WAS LONG! 
There was a man ascissors-maker. He had a son, he christened 
him Pedr’ Quadrad’. He sent him to school when he was eight 
years of age. He staid in school until he was twenty-five without 
learning his A B C. His godfather was San Anton. One day 
his father and his godfather had a talk about him. His father 
said, “I do not know what to do with the boy. He won’t learn 
anything. He is terrible.” ‘ The godfather said, “I will tell you 
something to scare him. If you scare him, he will learn some- 
thing. Make a casket, take it to the church, put it in the middle 
of the church, and put lights around it. Leave the keys of the 
church on the altar. Come home; at midnight say, ‘O my son! 
I forgot my church keys, fetch them, bring them to me.’ If he 
brings you the keys and is not frightened, then he never will learn

anything.” When Pedr’ Quadrad’ opened the church-door, he 
was so scared that his hair stood up on his head, and his hat fell 
off his head; but he said to the casket, ‘‘Move out of my way!” 
He took the keys, he took the priest’s stole and towel. With a 
stick he had he beat on that casket until he broke it to pieces. 
When he came home, he said, “Papa, to-morrow you must get 
a new casket, because I broke the one in the church to pieces.” 
Then he watched until his father slept. Before daylight he stole 
away from home. He took with him the stole and the towel. 
On his way he passed by a corral where there stood a bull with 
a spotted white face. The bull asked him, “Child, what are you 
doing here? Come and drink milk!” The bull gave him forty- 
nine quarts of milk. He drank. He went, went, went, until he 
came to a corral of goats. He heard them crying, “Me-e, me-e, 
me-e!” They gave him five bags of milk and forty cheeses, 
twenty cents! apiece. He went, went, went; he came to a large 
plain, where he saw twenty donkeys loaded with bags of water. 
One donkey was loading another. He went a little farther; 
he came to three apple-trees,— two bearing small apples, one 
bearing apples the size of your head. Three mares approached, 
they began to eat the little apples. They became three pretty 
women. Then the women began to eat the large apples. They 
turned back to mares, they ran off. Pedr’ Quadrad’ spread out 
his towel, he picked all the apples, he tied them up in his towel. 
He went on, and came to a king’s house, where, sitting on the 
verandah, were the king’s three daughters. They were pretty, 
even prettier than Americans. Those apples smelled so, you could 
smell them from here to California. The king’s daughters said 
to him, “O boy! give us an apple.” He gave each of them one of 
the large apples. As soon as they ate the apples, they turned 
into mares, they began to drop inside the house and to break 
everything. The king said to him, “Boy, I am going to kill 
you.” —No, you are not going to kill me.’—‘‘I am going to kill 
you.”—‘‘No, you are not going to kill me.”—“I am going to kill 
you.”—‘No, you are not going to kill me.” He gave the mares 
one of the little apples. As soon as they ate it, they turned into 
women again. The king said to him, “Boy, sell me those apples.” 
—‘‘No, I cannot sell them.”—‘‘Sell them to me. I will give you 
an overcoat; and with it on, every time you wheel round, five 
hundred persons will drop dead.” The boy said to him, “First 
1 Narrators would sometimes, as in this case, express values in American currency.

give me the overcoat.” He gave it. The boy put it on, he put 
his towelful of apples on his head, he started to go. The king 
said to him, “Give me the apples, or, if you do not give me the 
apples, give me my overcoat.”—‘What! do you want me to 
wheelround?” The king said tohim, “No! No! No! Goon!” 
He went on; he came to a man, an old man who had been 
making nails since he was eight years old. He lived at the foot of 
a tower which reached from earth to heaven. At the foot of it 
was a pile of nails the size of that oil-tank there Pedr’ Quadrad’ 
said to him, ‘‘ My friend, can you not tell me what is on top of this 
tower?”’—“‘ My son, I have been here since I was eight years old, 
and I cannot find out. You were born yesterday, how do you 
think that you can find out?”—“‘Sell me one thousand nails and 
a hammer, I will find out what is there.” The old man said to 
him, ‘“‘That is no trouble.” He gave him a basketful of nails and 
a hammer. As he climbed, he hammered. When he was near 
the top, the nails gave out. He pulled out the nail below the one 
he stood on; with the two nails he reached the top. There were 
two iron gates opening and shutting, through which nobody 
could pass. He touched them with his stole, they opened wide, 
he went in. There was nobody there; but the house was very 
rich, it shone like diamonds until it blinded him. He went in at 
mid-day. He waited until ten o’clock at night. He said, “O 
carag! 1am hungry!” He turned, and saw a table set with forty- 
eight plates, each holding half a quart, in each a different viand. 
He ate everything, ? he smoked the cigar he saw there. Then he 
pushed back his chair. He said, “Oh, but I’m sleepy!” He 
turned, he saw a bed that cost three thousand dollars, with sixteen 
feather mattresses. Once down in them, it would take you two 
hours to get up. He sat on the edge of the bed, he heard a voice 
from above: ‘Pedr’ Quadrad’, do you want me to drop?”— 
“Drop.” . Down dropped a quarter ofa man. “‘Pedr’ Quadrad’, 
do you want me to drop?”—“‘Drop.”’ Down dropped another 
quarter. Finally seven quarters dropped down, and formed a 
giant with fourteen heads. The giant asked, ‘“‘Why are you so

impudent as to come into my house?” The boy answered, “A 
house is for a man to come in.”—“ Why are you so impudent as to 
eat at my table?” —“‘A table is made to eat at.”—‘‘ Why are you 
so impudent as to lie in my bed?”—“‘A bed is made to lie in.” 
The giant said to him, “ Pedr’ Quadrad’, we will make a contract, 
whoever breaks it will kill the other.”—‘‘Make a hundred con- 
tracts if you wish.”—‘I want to wrestle with you, who puts the 
other down will kill him.” Pedr’ Quadrad’ was as long as he was 
broad. They wrestled. The giant pushed him from one side to 
the other; but it was the same whether he was lying or standing. 
This giant was a devil. Pedr’ Quadrad’ touched the back of his 
leg with his stole, down he fell. Pedr’ Quadrad’ said to him, “I 
_am going to kill you.”—‘‘No, fall is two.”! They wrestled, 
wrestled, wrestled; Pedr’ touched him again with the stole, again 
he fell. Pedr’ said to him, “I am going to kill you.” —“No, fall 
is three.”-—‘‘No, I will not wrestle any more. I am going to kill 
you.” —‘‘Do not kill me! I will give you the riches of this tower 
to make you rich for life.” The giant said to him, “Go ahead!””— 
“No, go ahead yourself! You built this house.” They went down 
a stairway of velvet, the velvet so thick that at every step one of 
them sank to the neck. When they reached the bottom, the 
giant said to him, “Dig here.”—‘‘No, dig yourself.” The giant 
had finger-nails sixteen palms long. He dug with them until 
he pulled up a diamond as big as from here to Boston, and as long 
as from here to California. Pedr’ Quadrad’ put the diamond in 
his towel.2. He went on his way

announced that he would marry his daughter to any one who 
could make a boat to run on Jand and sea. So the eldest son said, 
“Mother, I am going to the woods to cut wood for that boat.” 
On his way he met an old man. (It was God.) The old man was 
full of leprosy, the flies alighted on him, he stank. “My son, 
where are you going?” asked the old man. “Shut up!” answered 
the boy, “you stink.” —“‘Go ahead,” said the old man, “and good 
fortune go with you.” He went on to the woods, all day he could 
not make the slightest impression on the smallest tree. The next 
day the second son went. He too met the old man; he too said, 
“Shut up! you stink.” He too had to return home unsuccessful. 
Then the youngest (covde) went. He had with him a cake (gufong) 
and a bottle of water. When he met the old man, he said, “Oh, 
poor old man!” and he gave him a piece of his cake. He warmed 
the water from his bottle in his mouth, with it he washed the sores 
of the old man. ‘Manuel, where are you going?” asked the old 
man. “I’m going to try my fortune making a boat that will run 
on land and sea.”—‘‘Shut your eyes,” said the old man. When 
Manuel opened them, he saw in front of him the finest vessel that 
ever was built. ‘‘Here is your boat,” said the old man. 
Manuel went on, he passed by a man holding up a cliff. “What 
are you doing?” asked Manuel. “The man is more than a man.” 
—This is nothing,” answered the man. “J am just up from a 
sick-bed, and I am. trying to see if I have any strength left.”— 
~~ “Do you want to join my crew?” asked Manuel. ‘‘Yes,” said 
the man: They went on, they passed by a man pointing a gun 
into the sky. “What are you doing?” they asked. “The Virgin 
Mary is asleep, there’s a fly on her cheek, I’m going to shoot it off,” 
answered the man. They took him along; they went on, they 
met a man who was catching bulls and horses and donkeys to eat 
them raw. “What are you doing?”—‘Oh, nothing much. I’m 
just up from a sick-bed, and I’m testing my appetite.” They 
took him along; they went on, they met a man with one foot here 
and one foot in California. “What is this?”’—“I’m just up 
from a sick-bed, and I’m trying [to see] if I canrun.” They took 
him along; they went on, they met a man drinking the ocean dry. 
“What are you doing?” —“Oh, nothing much. I’m just up from 
a sick-bed, and I’m trying [to see] what I can drink.”—“Stop 
trying,” said Manuel. “You will wreck my ship.” At the door 
of the king’s house they dropped anchor. “You have not filled 
the contract yet,” said the king. “The ship must run on land as

well as on water.”—‘“That is easy. I have a man who can put 
this ship on the land.” Manuel went to Porter (Caregador); he 
said, “Porter, I have a contract I don’t know how I can fill.” 
—“What is it?” —“‘To put this ship on land.” —‘‘That’s nothing. 
Tell the king to bring his people to dance on the ship, so I 
can have a good load.”” When they were all on board, Porter put 
his shoulder under the ship and carried it to the land “Here 
is my daughter. You may marry her to-morrow,” said the king. 
But that night Manuel dreamed of the daughter of the Re’ 
Grande, the prettiest woman in the world; so he set sail for the 
port of the Re’ Grande. After he anchored, he invited the royal 
family to dinner; the next day the king invited him alone. (The 
sailors did not eat at the king’s table.) ‘‘I have not come to eat, 
but to marry your daughter,” said Manuel. “Good, but we 
must make a contract,” said the king. ‘You haven’t much to 
eat on your table,” said Manuel. (There was almost enough for 
four hundred persons.) “I have a man on shipboard who can eat 
all you have here.” —“If you produce a man who can eat all this, 
we need no further contract,” said the king. Manuel went to 
Eater (Comedor), and said, “Eater, I have a contract I don’t 
know how I can fill.”’—“ What is it?” —“To eat food enough for 
four hundred men.” Eater went to the palace and ate up every- 
thing on the table. Then he went out into the pasture and ate up 
all the cows and horses there.? The king said, “I have an old

falling, and they run. It falls on the king’s house, and smashes it into dust. (Fogo.)

her marriage, costing fifty-seven conte de reis. . . . “There’s some dancing to do before you 
marry her,” says the king. To the funeral (zo/had’) have come people from seven cities. 
Four hundred women have cooked the food for them to eat before they go to the church. 
There are five hundred pots of food, each holding ten a/queira; and this is what Eater 
has to eat... . Twice he uses the spoon the king gave him; then, throwing it away, he tips 
each pot back into his mouth. “Did you disturb me only to come and eat this?” he asks. 
“We have still some dancing,” says the king. He says that four hundred hogsheads 
of brandy of Cabo Verde will have to be drunk. “Only a mata biche [first little drink in 
the morning “to kill the worm” in the intestines] for me,” says Drinker (Bededor). 
They give him a baruma, and he asks for a sledge-hammer (mailho) to take off the heads 
of the casks. (Fogo.) .

must have Runner [Corredor] too. Let the old woman and Runner 
fetch water from a place four miles away. If the old woman 
returns here before Runner, you lose my daughter; you win her if 
he returns before the old woman.” Manuel went to Runner; he 
said, “Runner, I have a contract I don’t know how I can fill.” — 
“What is it?’”—“Fetching water from a place four miles away 
before an old woman.”—“That’s nothing. Has she started?” — 
“No.”—“Tell her to start.” But just as he himself was ready to 
start, the old woman, who was a witch, passed an apple under his 
nose, and down he fell asleep. Then the old woman started, run- 
ning faster than the wind. On the ship was Hearer (Oxdidor), his 
ear open to what was happening everywhere in the world. He 
learned that Runner was lying asleep, he pointed him out to 
Shooter (Tirador). Shooter shot past his eyes, waking him up. 
He sprang up, he put one foot on the well, he took the bottle from 
the old woman, his other foot he swung back to the king’s house.! 
Then the king gave Manuel another bottle, he said that inside 
of it was his daughter. “Open it, call her by name, Bright-Moon 
[Lua Clar’), out she will come.” They sailed away; Manuel said 
to the crew, “I’m going to show you my wife,” he pulled out the 
bottle. On the top of the mast was sitting a little devil. Down 
he came, he grabbed the bottle, he made off with it. Manuel 
called on Shooter. “Very well, but I must smoke first,” said 
Shooter. He rolled a cigarette, he began to smoke.? Then he 
took his gun, he shot at the little devil, he brought him down to 
the ship. “Give him to me, I'll eat him up,” said Eater.

When they made land, there was the king [the first king] wait- 
ing for Manuel to marry his daughter. “Oh, I don’t marry a 
servant,” said Manuel. “No girl is prettier than mine,” said the 
king. Manuel pulled out his bottle and called out, “ Bright-Moon!”” 
It was night-time, the light shone all over the house, and the other 
girl was put to shame. Manuel married Bright-Moon, and took 
half the riches of the kingdom. 
(Variant a.) 
There was a king who gave notice throughout the world that 
whoever made a boat to run on land might marry the princess his 
daughter. There were a man and a woman had seven sons. 
The oldest said, “I am going to make some cuscus. I am going 
to make that boat to run on land.” When he went, he went with 
all the equipment. He reached the place where he was going to 
make the boat, he saw an old man coming towards him. He took 
three stones, he ran after the man all day. In the afternoon he 
escaped to the foot of Judo Funal. The man disappeared. 
Then he returned. He ate his food, he took the road home. 
Another brother said he was going to make the boat which would 
run on land. He made some cuscus. With his tools he went. 
He reached the place, he put things on the ground to eat, he saw 
seven men pack the bills on the vessel. They set sail; at midnight, when they reach the 
Mar de Gulf, an old witch steals all the money. Shooter shoots at her. Next day she, 
together with the money, drop to the deck. Pedr’ Quadrad’ goes home, and the richest 
man there on the island is but his almoner. “I passed that way, and Pedr’ Quadrad’ gave 
me a big alms [esmola].” (Fogo.) 
(2) Porter puts all the property of Paul’ of Praia on his shoulders. “This is nothing, not 
ballast enough to keep the wind from blowing me down.” Paul’ of Praia goes to court, he 
claims that Paul’ of Terra Fal has stolen all his property. The judge gives him a force of 
four hundred soldiers to fight to get back his property. Diviner warns Paul’ of Terra Fal. 
Gas-Shooter says, “This is nothing. Go ahead of me. I don’t want to kill you.” 
When the soldiers approach, he loosens up his finger, he does not pull it out, he blows the 
soldiers into the sky. They turn into sparrows (?) (chofa) and fly home. (Cab’ Verde.) 
1 Variant: Paul’ of Terra Fal says he is going to divide the property among those who 
helped him get it. He has enough without. He divides everything except one needle. 
Porter says, “This needle belongs to me, I carried the goods away.” Gas-Shooter 
says, “This needle belongs to me, I made way with the soldiers.” Walker says, “This 
needle belongs to me, I beat the Negress.” Diviner says, “This needle belongs to me, I saw 
that Walker was asleep.” Eater says, “This needle belongs to me, I ate everything up.’’ 
—Each is right,” says Paul’ of Terra Fal; and he takes the case to court, but he cannot 
getadecision. ‘I'll settle the case,” says Gas-Shooter. He loosens up, he blows the 
others out of sight. They never return, and Gas-Shooter takes the things and makes 
Terra Fal the richest place in the country. “I know some of the rich men who have 
come from there.” The offerice was: “This is of the sea, this is of the land. He who 
knew this word was St. Anton of Lisbon. [Desse di mar, desse di terra. Quemque

ground was full of wood all cut up. He sat down to breakfast. 
He saw the old man coming towards him. He began to eat, and 
covered the food with the cloth. He called the old man; he said,

down, he asked Pedr’ what he was doing there? He said, “The

the world that whoever made a boat to run on land he would 
marry to his daughter.” He said, “Pira, are you going to make 
the boat?” He said, “Faith in God, I will make it.” He said, 
“Pira, lie down a while and sleep.” He said, ““Do not let me 
sleep.” After he had slept, this old man called him. When he 
woke up, he found the boat all ready. He lifted anchor, he set 
out on the voyage, he went to seek for sailors. First he met 
Smart. He said, “Smart, do you want to go on my boat?” 
He said, “I want to, let’s go!” They went a little way, they met 
Eater, He said, “Eater, you want to go with me on my boat?” 
—“Let’s go!” He went a little way, he met Drinker. He said, 
“You want to go on my boat?” He said, “Let’s go!” He went 
a little way, they met Diviner. He said, “You want to go with 
me on my boat?” He said, “Let’s go!” He went a little way, 
he met Hunter. He said, “You want to go on my boat?” He 
said, “Let’s go!” Then they anchored in the port of the king. 
Pira went to the king’s. The king told him it was well that he 
had made a boat to run on land, still the bargain was not com- 
pleted. He had to eat a hundred cows within three months; if 
not, he would not marry his daughter. Then he went on board 
to weep. Eater said to him, “Why are you sad to-day?”—“Sir 
King gave me six hogsheads of wine to drink in three days, if I 
desire to marry his daughter.” He said, “That is nothing;” he 
said, “Sit down to rest wherever you like.” He took a crowbar, he 
started. When they arrived, he made a hole in a hogshead, the 
wine flowed out very slowly. Drinker said, “Behead the barrel 
you gave me.” Within three days there was no wine. Then he

took a crowbar and carried these barrels empty to the house of 
the king. Pira went to the king. He said, “I have finished.” 
The king said to him, “Our bargain is not yet completed. You 
are to carry a bottle to the fountain of Cheforiz [chafariz, ‘foun- 
tain’], and the old woman another bottle. If the old woman 
comes in first, I will give [her] half of my estate; if you get it first, 
you shall marry the princess my daughter.” Pedr’ came to the 
boat, sat down sad. Smart said, ‘Why are you sad to-day, Pedr’?”’ 
He said, “I am sad because Sir King has given the old witch a 
bottle, he gave me another bottle, the one of us who gets water 
in the fountain of Cheforiz he will pay. If it is me who gets it 
first, he will marry me to his daughter. If the old witch gets it 
first, he will give her half his estate.’ The old woman came 
early in the afternoon, she called Pedr’. He said, “I will catch 
up with you on the road.” ira slept all night. In the morning 
Diviner divined where the old woman was. He told Smart the 
old woman was in such a place. He got up, he put one foot on 
board the boat, he put one foot at the mouth of the fountain, he 
reached out his hand, he took the water, he met the old woman 
on the road. When he met the old woman on the road, the old 
woman said, “Smart, lay down your head, I will look for bugs, 
look for lice.” She put the skull of a corpse under his head. 
He fell asleep. On the boat Diviner divined that Smart had got 
the water, met the old woman on the road, the old woman had 
put the skull of a corpse under his head, he had slept, he was still 
sleeping. Hunter took a gun. He got up on the deck. He said, 
“Let some one point a finger straight at that skull of a corpse.” 
When Hunter shot, the skull from a corpse flew up, and Smart 
got up, dazed with sleep. He suspected that the old woman had 
carried the bottle to the house of the king. He went, all the 
same. When the old woman had reached the door of the king, 
Smart arrived; he took the bottle from the old woman, he gave 
her a slap; the old woman disappeared, and has been lost to sight 
to this day. And then the king procured twenty-four priests; 
they published the bans on the fifteenth, and married on the 
twenty-fourth.

83. THE SACK OF LIEs.! 
There was a woman had a child born with a whistle in his hand. 
He would go out and whistle, and all the rats of the world would 
come to listen to him. He would shut them up in a corral. At 
night he would open the corral and let them out. When the king 
heard of this whistle, he thought it was too valuable for the boy 
toown. Then the king planned with his family what they would 
do to get the whistle away from the boy.’ First to come to the 
boy was a little Negress of whom the king did not think much. 
The little Negress said, “Boy, sell me your whistle.”—‘‘No, I 
cannot sell it to you.” —‘“‘Why not? I'll give you twenty dollars 
for it.”—‘I cannot sell it to you; but if you lie with me, I will 
giveitto you.” The little Negress lay with him. When they had 
carried out the plan, she asked him for the whistle. He said to 
her, “No, I will not give it to you; and if you take it, I will tell 
the princess what you did.” Second to come was the princess. 
She said to him, “Boy, sell me your whistle.’’-—‘‘No, I cannot sell 
it.’—‘Why not? I will give you twenty dollars for it.’—‘“I 
cannot sell it.’—‘‘ What do you want for it?” —“If I were not a 
little fellow, and you were not a princess, if you lay with me, I 
would give you the whistle.” The princess lay with him. When 
they had carried out the plan, the princess asked for the whistle. 
“No, you cannot get it; and if you take it, I will tell the queen 
what you did.” Third to come was Lady Queen. She said, 
“Boy, sell me your whistle.”—‘‘No, I cannot sell it.”—‘‘Why 
not? I will give you twenty dollars for it.’—“I cannot sell it.” — 
“What do you want for it?”’—“If I were not a little fellow, and 
you were not the Lady Queen, if you lay with me, I would give you 
the whistle.” The queen lay with him. When they had carried 
out the plan, she asked him for the whistle. “No, you cannot get 
it; and if you take it, I will tell the king what you did.” Fourth 
to come was Sir King. He said, “Boy, sell me your whistle.”— 
“No, I cannot sell. it’’-—“Why not? I will give you twenty

dollars for it.”—‘I cannot sell it.”—‘‘ What do you want for it?” 
—If I were not a little fellow, and you were not the king, and 
you ran with that mare of mine,! I would give you the whistle.” 
The king ran with the mare. When he had finished, he asked 
[the boy] for the whistle. The boy said to him, “You cannot 
get it; and if you take it from me, I will tell the Lady Queen 
what you did.” The king said, “Boy, to-morrow come to my 
house to tell me seven ? sacks of lies; and if you do not tell them, 
I will kill you.” The next day the boy arrived at the king’s 
house; the sacks were ready, and the cords to tie them with, when 
he began. When he began to tell what the little Negress did, the 
little Negress said, “You are aliar!”* He said, “Tie up one sack.” 
He started to tell what the princess did. The princess said, “You 
are a liar!” He said, “Tie up another sack.” He turned to tell 
what the queen did. The queen said, “You are a liar!” —‘Tie 
up another sack.” He turned to tell what the king did. The 
king said, “Boy, you are a devil. Get your things and get out 
from here!” 
Little Negress did it; Princess did it, she did not know Little 
Negress did it; Lady Queen did it, she did not know Princess did 
it; Sir King did it, he did not know Lady Queen did it; the mare 
did it, she did not know Sir King did it. Here are the seven sacks 
of lies for you. 
84.5 THE PRINCESS WHO ASKS RIDDLES: THE SACK OF LIES. 
There was a man married toa woman. Married sixteen years, 
they had no child. Then they had a son. They named him 
Manuel de Piedad. His father gave him a good education for ten 
years. When he was seventeen years old, his father died. His 
mother became poor. One day Manuel was twenty years old, he 
read in the paper that the king would give a fortune to any one 
who could guess the riddles of the princess. Manuel told his

king came to me and asked me to sell my whistle. I told her it would be necessary to put 
Jack in prison.”—“A lie, Sir King!” (Boa Vista.)

clusion satisfactory to any of us.

mother that he saw in the paper [something] that they could make 
a living out of, and that he was going to the king’s house to guess 
the riddles of the princess. His mother begged him, “Do not go! 
Do you not know that anybody who does not guess her riddles 
will die, and twenty-five men have already died there? Nobody 
escapes.” Manuel said to her, “I am going, dead or alive.” 
His mother made him three loaves of bread and three cakes. 
She put poison into the three cakes. She told him the cakes were 
for him, the bread was for his donkey. The name of his donkey 
was Paul’. After they had travelled all the morning, Manuel felt 
hungry. He got off his donkey, and he found the bread and the 
cakes in his bag. The bread was hard, and the cakes were soft. 
He said to himself, ‘Paul’ has carried me well; I will give him the 
soft cakes, and eat the hard bread myself.” When Paul’ ate the 
cake, he fell down dead. Manuel said, ‘“‘My poor little donkey 
is dead!” He started on. After he had gone about twenty 
steps, he saw three vultures fly and alight on the donkey and pull 
out the entrails. As soon as they started to eat, all three dropped 
dead. Manuel came back, tied the birds together, strung them 
over his shoulder. He went on, he passed by seven robbers. 
They asked him if he would sell them his vultures. He sold them 
for half a dollar apiece. Then he waited to see what the robbers 
would do with them. One of the robbers began to pluck the 
birds, then to cook them. Then all of them sat down to eat. 
As soon as they began to eat, they dropped over dead. He said, 
“T have a riddle now for the princess:— 
“The cake kills Paul’, 
Paul’ kills three, 
Three kill seven. 
The princess will not be able to guess this riddle.” 
When he arrived at the king’s house, he was so guileless, they 
made light of him. He said he had come to ask the princess a 
riddle. The king asked him, “Do you know what you are doing?” 
He said, “Yes, I know. If the princess guesses my riddle, you 
will cut off my neck. If she does not guess it, I shall get a for- 
tune.” Then he asked the princess, “What is the thing? — 
“The cake kills Paul’, 
Paul’ kills three, 
And three kill seven?”
-P-A-G-E-281
254 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society. 
The princess waited twenty minutes without answering him. 
Then the princess told the king that she could not guess that riddle. 
But the king was unwilling to lose the fortune. He considered 
making a plan to rob Manuel of the fortune. He said to Manuel, 
“You have still something to do before you receive the fortune. 
Here are three rabbits, set them free in the mountains, then in 
thirty days give them back to me fattened up, you will receive the 
fortune.” Manuel took the three rabbits, he carried them off to 
the mountains. He was very downcast. He said, “O God! if I 
set them free here, how can I ever find them again?” Just then 
he saw an old woman standing near him. She said to him, “My 
son, why are you so troubled?”—‘‘Old Lady, I am wondering 
how I shall find these rabbits again if I let them free.” The old 
woman gave him a whistle; she said to him, “Whenever you want 
them, blow this whistle; wherever they are, they will come to 
you.”! Then the old woman disappeared. Manuel was happy. 
He built himself a shelter. There he staid for fifteen days. Then 
he thought he would try the whistle. He blew, the rabbits came 
jumping, guich, quich, quich. “All right!” He ran his hand 
along their backs, he felt them sleek and fat. 
On the twentieth day, the king told the princess to disguise 
herself, to go into the mountains and offer the boy any amount of 
money he wanted for one of the rabbits. When the princess 
reached the mountains, she asked Manuel, “What are you doing 
here?” —“I am fattening three little rabbits to take to Sir King.” 
—What, in this mountain! Do you think you can find them 
again?”—~“Yes, I can find them.”-—“I wish to see you do it.”” 
He blew his whistle. They came jumping up, fatter than they 
were. One of them had a black spot. She said to [the boy], 
“Sell me that spotted one.” —‘‘No, I have no orders to sell it. I 
have to take it to the king.” The princess insisted, she offered 
him a big bag of money she had with her. “No, I will not sell it 
unless you give me the gold heart you have hanging on your neck.” 
The princess had to give him the gold heart for the rabbit. She 
put it in a basket, she covered it with a cloth. She put the basket 
in front of her on her horse. She went her way. After she left, 
Manuel regretted the loss of his rabbit. He thought he would 
whistle for it. As soon as he whistled, the rabbit jumped out of 
the basket and ran back to him. 
When the princess reached home, she told them what had

happened to her. The queen said to her, “You do not know 
much. Now, I am going to go for him now.” The queen put on 
a shabby dress. She went out into the mountains, she found 
Manuel. Manuel said to himself, “First it was the daughter, 
now it is the mother. I will settle her.” The queen asked him, 
“Boy, what are you doing here?””—“‘I am fattening three little 
rabbits to take to the king in eight days.’—‘‘You talk about 
fattening rabbits in this desert! How can you fatten them? 
You cannot see them.”—‘“I can see them any time I wish.” 
“Let me see you.” He pulled out his whistle, he blew, his three 
rabbits presented themselves. The queen said to him, “‘Sell me 
that one with the black spot. I have money here to make you 
rich for life.’—‘No, I would not sell it for any money in the 
world; but I will give it to you in exchange for the bracelet that 
you have on your arm.” The queen said that did not cost much. 
“Here, give me the rabbit.” He put the rabbit in her basket. 
Manuel said, “This is the second time I am going to try my 
whistle. The third time may be the gallows.” When the queen 
was a little way off, he whistled, the rabbit jumped out of the 
basket and came back. ‘ 
When the queen arrived, the king said to her, “I thought you 
were wise.” The queen answered, “That little fellow has the 
devil in him.” The king said, ““Now, it is 1 who go.” He 
made an iron cage. He disguised himself as an old shepherd. 
When he found Manuel in his hut, he said to him, “Boy, what are 
you doing here?”—“I am fattening three little rabbits to take 
to the king.’—“‘Rabbits! Strange! I should like to see rabbits 
in these mountains!” Manuel said to him, “You would like to 
see them?” He blew his whistle. The rabbits jumped up. 
“Indeed, they are fat. Sell me this one with the black spot. I 
will give you as much money as you wish.” —“‘No, I will not sell 
it for any amount of money; but I will give it to you in exchange 
for that ring you have on your finger.” The ring the king was 
wearing had his name in it. “TI will give you this ring, but my 
name is on the other side of it. Do not put it on before anybody, 
because that would bring me into contempt.”—“‘This is business. 
Tf you give me the ring for the rabbit, I will do what I like with 
it.” The king gave him the ring, he took the rabbit, he put it in 
the iron cage, he left. All the rest of the day Manuel whistled 
for the rabbits, but only two came. He said to himself, “Now 
you are in a lasso.”
-P-A-G-E-283
256 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society. 
Three days later the thirty days were up; Manuel took the two 
rabbits, he started for the city. He met the same old woman at 
the same place he met her going out. The old woman said to him, 
The little rabbit which they stole from you is disgusted at being 
alone. Before you reach the king’s house, whistle, it will come 
to you.” When Manuel passed the city gate, he whistled, the 
lost rabbit jumped up and joined the others. Manuel said, “He 
is thin, but I will take care of him.” When he came to the king’s 
house, the king said to him, ‘‘Manuel, two of the rabbits are nice 
and fat. What is the matter with the third?”—‘‘Three days 
before I came, that rabbit with the black spot got diarrhoea, that 
made him thin.”— ‘Manuel, I see you are a big liar. You are to 
fill a sack full of lies, which will complete our account.”—“‘Get 
your sack ready. I will start.” Manuel said, “When I was out 
in the mountains, the princess came to buy a rabbit.” The prin- 
cess said to him, “You lie!”—“‘Put it in the sack!”’—‘‘How do 
you know that she was the princess?”—“I have her golden 
heart.” —“ You lie!” —“Put it in the sack!... A few days later 
the queen came to buy a rabbit.”—‘‘ You lie!”—‘Put it in the 
sack!”,—“‘How do you know that it was the queen?” —“T have 
her bracelet.”—‘“‘ You lie!”—‘“Into the sack! Into the sack!— 
When it lacked three days of the time for my return, the king 
came to buy a rabbit.” The king said to him, “You lie! The 
sack is full! The sack is full!’?1 
Then Manuel got his fortune. He took it back to his mother. 
They were well off [?]. 
85. THE PRINCESS WHO ASKS RIDDLES.? 
There was a king had a daughter, an asker of riddles. The king 
announced that he would give his daughter in marriage to any one 
who could guess her riddle and ask her what she could not guess. 
If the princess caught him, she would have him killed; and if he 
caught the princess, he would marry her. Every one was afraid 
to try. 
There was a woman who had a half-witted son, his name was 
Half-Wit. He told his mother that he was going to try for the 
princess. His mother begged him not to try, “because none of 
the boys who are good scholars will try, and yet you, who are 
without schooling or education, want to try. You will surely be

killed.” Nevertheless he asked his mother to make him some 
bread to eat on his journey. She made him some bread, she put 
poison in it. 
The boy had a donkey which was called Maétamata. Early 
in the morning he set out for the king’s house. After a little he 
felt hungry, he took out his bread to eat. Whenever he was going 
to eat, he would give his donkey to eat. This. time, when he 
gave the donkey some of his bread, the donkey fell down dead. 
As he was grieving about the donkey, he saw three crows alight 
on the carcass of the donkey. As soon as they began to eat, they 
too died. Then seven more crows fell on the three to eat. They 
dropped dead. ‘“‘Here I have a fine riddle for the princess,” he 
said to himself. “I left home with Matamdata and some bread. 
I broke it in halves, I gave a piece to Matamata. Matamata fell 
dead. Three crows began to eat Matamata, they fell dead. 
Seven more crows began to eat the three, they fell dead too.” ! 
He went on a little farther, he met a sow with three little pigs. 
He dropped on his knees, he said a prayer, he took one of the 
little pigs, he made a fire, he cooked it, he ate. He said, “Now I 
have another good riddle to ask the princess. I met a sow with 
three little pigs. With three words to God one of them served 
for my dinner.” ? When he arrived at the palace of the king, he 
said that he came to race* with the princess. The king asked him, 
“Do you understand that if you catch her with a riddle, you will 
marry her; if she catches you, you will die?” The boy said, “I 
know,” and he agreed. ‘Only let me start first.” —‘‘Very well,” 
said the king. “What is a thing [Cusa é uma cousal,t—

use of “race” in the Bahamas. To “‘race” in asking riddles is purgunta dibinahson disafio. 
The “race” consists, not in the number of riddles asked, but in the difficulty experienced 
in answering them.

with“ Cusa éum cousa?” Both cusa and cousa are from the Portuguese word coisa (“thing”).

What is a thing,— 
“One meets one,

The princess took her books, she looked on every leaf, she could 
find no answers. She called Half-Wit; she said to him, “I will 
let you stay with me in my room if you will tell me the answers.” 
He agreed; “but only if you give-me your ring first.” She gave 
him the ring, he told her the answers. Then she ran, she entered 
her room, she left him in the street, she did not fulfil her promise. 
The next morning she told her father that she knew the answers 
to the boy’s riddles. The king was pleased. He told Half-Wit 
that his daughter had guessed his riddles. “My father was a 
hunter, and a good hunter,” Half-Wit said to him, “whereas I am 
unskilful, a mere beginner. I shot at a cock, I did not bring 
down the cock, I got merely one of its feathers.”” And he showed 
the king the ring of the princess. 
Then the king published the wedding. He published it with 
sixteen priests, he married him with twenty-four priests. He 
gave a feast lasting seven years and one day, and that last day 
was the Fourth of July,! which they still celebrate in the country. 
86. THE STOLEN RING.? 
There was a boy who was fifteen years old and who did not like 
going to school. One day he met two fishermen. When he came 
home, he said to his mother, “‘Mamma, don’t you know, a fisher- 
man is the last fellow to die of hunger? There’s always fish for 
him to catch.” His mother said to him, “Do you want a fishing- 
line?” —“‘Yes’m, a fishing-line and a fish-hook too.” He went 
fishing with the two fishermen for a week. On Sunday they did 
not want to go fishing, but the boy told his mother that he was 
going fishing. His mother said to him, “Don’t go! It’s bad 
weather for fishing on Sunday.” When he went, the sea was wild, 
and the weather was bad. He sat down to wait for the tide to 
ebb. By ten o’clock the tide was low, he went down and got two 
shell-fish. He said to himself, “God will give me some fish.” 
1 At home the day mentioned would probably be St. John’s Day.

He baited his hook. The fish stole the first bait, but with the 
second he caught a fish. When he pulled it up, he put it on top 
of the rocks. It was a fish siren. The siren said to him, “Loose 
me, let me go!” —‘‘No, I will not let you go.”—‘ Loose me, let me 
go, because J’m not a fish! If you loose me, let me go, I will give 
you a charm, so that you need fish no more.”—“Go get the 
charm! but you must go with the hook in; and if you delay very 
long, I will pull you up again.” She dived down, she brought 
up aring on her finger: The boy said to her, “No, I don’t want a 
ring, I want fish.” The siren said to him, “With this ring you 
will get fish, you will get money, you will get everything you 
wish.” The boy said to her, “I do not trust you. You must ask 
for these things with your own mouth.” She asked the ring to 
give her a table fully served. He sat down to eat. He had ona 
shirt with a long tail. The siren turned up the tail of his shirt, 
she filled it with money. He said to her, “God goes with you,” 
and he threw his fishing-pole into the sea. When he reached home, 
his mother saw no fish; she said to him, “You see what I told you 
about fishing on Sunday?’ He gave the ring to his mother. 
He said to her, “This ring will give you whatever you wish. It 
will give you rations to last a month.” It built her a house with 
everything in it which she needed. As for the boy, he went out 
to have a good time. 
One day, on his way home, he found a little dog crying. He 
said, ‘Poor hungry little dog!” He tucked it under his coat, he 
took it home to his mother. It was a wretched-looking little dog, 
his mother did not like it. Next day, on his way home, he found 
a little cat crying. He took it home also. His mother said to 
him, “Boy, you are crazy! Don’t you know that a dog doesn’t 
like a cat?” Next day, on his way home, he found a little rat 
crying. He picked it up, he took it home. His mother said to 
him, “This is a nice thing you are doing. First you bring a dog, 
then you bring a cat. The dog does not like the cat. Then you 
bring a rat, which the cat does not like.”—‘Mother, tie each 
separate, feed them three times a day. In a week tell me if they 
are not friends.” In a week they were all playing together like 
three brothers. 
The mother of Seocenho had a sister living in San Anton who 
did not care for her because she was poor. Well, this woman 
heard that her sister in San Nicolao was getting rich. She de- 
cided to cross over to San Nicolao to ascertain for certain. The

day she went was the day that her sister asked the ring for money. 
Her sister had a friend she brought with her. They were in the 
next room. She peeped into the room where her sister was 
talking to the ring. She turned; she said to her friend, ‘The 
riches of my sister come from that ring. Let us steal it from her 
to-night!” They stole it. The next day they went to San 
Anton. A month passed; the woman looked for the ring to ask 
it for money for the month, but she could not find the ring. Well, 
another month passed, still she could not find the ring; but she 
did not tell her son. But he went to where were the dog, the cat, 
and the rat. They turned to jump on him to show him that they 
were hungry. He asked his mother if she had fed them. ‘“‘No, 
we have no milk in the house.”—‘‘Why? Doesn’t the ring give 
you money?”—‘‘No, I have lost the ring.”” Seocenho scratched 
his head; he said, “‘God! Who trusts in a woman always re- 
pents.” 
One day the dog sniffed at the wind. He said to the cat and 
rat, “That ring went to San Anton.” Rat said to him, “If that 
ring is in San Anton, we must go there to get it.” They went 
down to Porto Preguisa one hour past noon. There Dog said to 
Cat, “You must jump into the water.” Cat said, “I don’t 
know how to swim.” Dog said, “Then how are we going to get 
the ring?” Cat and Rat said to Dog, “Do you drop into the sea 
first.”—‘‘No, you two will go first.’ He took them, he threw 
them into the sea. He dropped too. He said to them, “Jump 
on my back.” They crossed to San Anton. It was still daylight. 
They waited until night before starting to go to the house. When 
they arrived, Dog said to them, “I'll stay here in the kitchen near 
the hearth, you go on.” Rat said to Dog, “I know that you are 
hungry. The first thing I’ll look for will be a piece of meat. Ill 
send it to you by Cat.” After Rat sent the meat for Dog, he 
looked about, he found the ring. He went to meet Cat. He 
said, “I’ve found the ring. It was tied up in a handkerchief in a 
little box. I gnawed through the box and the handkerchief. I 
took the ring. Now I’m going into the closet, I will break the 
dishes, the people will call for you.” When the woman heard the 
rat, she cried out, “Jesus! Where did that rat come from? 
God! can’t you send me a cat?” As soon as the cat heard these 
words, the cat miaowed at the door; and the woman said, ““O God! 
have you sent me a cat as quick as that?” The woman opened 
the door. Rat said softly to Cat, “Here I am.” Then the

woman opened the door for the cat to run out with the rat. 
They all ran down to the seashore. 
Dog said to them, “Climb upon my back.” They climbed up, 
they left for San Nicolao. In the middle of the sea Dog asked 
Rat, “Have you the ring?” —“Yes, on my finger.” Dog said to 
him, “Give it to me, I want it.” Rat said, “You have no finger 
to put it on.” Dog said, “If you do not give it to me, I shall 
drown.” Rat said, “You have no place to put it. Your mouth 
is too big. You will lose it.” Cat said, “Give it to him. If you 
do not give it to him, he will drown us here.” Then Rat gave Dog 
the ring. He put it in his mouth. Then Dog opened his mouth, 
the ring fell down to the bottom of the sea. They reached the 
land. Rat said, “All our work for nothing! You lost the ring 
because your mouth was too big.” 
On shore they saw a number of crabs. Dog said, “Rat, you 
stand there! — Cat, you stand there! and me, [I will stand] here. 
We will catch those crabs. They stole the ring.” The crabs 
said, “What did we do for you to catch us?”—“You stole our 
ring. It is at the bottom of the sea. You must go and get it.” 
A crab who had lost his claw (foot) said, “Well, Vill be the first to 
go.” He went, he looked, he found it. He came and said to 
them, “I know where it is, but one smaller than I must go get it.” 
A little crab said, “I will go get it. We can’t all go to prison.” 
He went, he came back with the ring on his finger. “Is that the 
ring?” Dog said, “Yes. You are all free.” They brought the 
ring toSeocenho. They said to him, “It was in San Anton, We 
bring it back.” The boy said to his mother, “You see, this is my 
doing. If I had not been a friend to the dog, the cat, and the rat, 
where should we be now?” This time he took charge of the ring 
himself. He said, “The man who trusts in a woman ends in jail 
or hospital.” 
87. SEVEN TONGUE-TIPS 
There was a city where a king lived. In this city was a well 
whose water came from a place where lived seven robbers (su/- 
teadors). Every household that wanted water had to give them a 
person. Now, there were no more households to give a person 
but the king’s. In this city was a man named Jon Porcero. He

was the herd of all the pigs in the city; and he was so used to 
being with pigs, he looked like a pig. There was a boy so know- 
ing, that, in all the colleges of France and Lisbon and England and 
America, no boy was more knowing than he. He came to the 
king’s house the day the princess was to be sent to the robbers at 
the well. (As soon as she should reach the well, the water would 
flow; but the robbers would keep her three days before killing 
her.) The king’s house was covered with black. The boy asked 
why the king’s house was in mourning. They told him there was 
a well in that city, and seven robbers; and when they wanted the 
water to flow, they had to send them a person. The time had 
__ come to send the king’s daughter. The boy asked the king for a 
gun and a bag (saralh’) to go to war, he did not tell him that he 
was going to save his daughter. He went to the house of the 
robbers. They were out, and the princess opened the door. 
“You would better go from here,” she said. “‘Seven robbers live 
here. Six of them are bad enough; but the seventh is the worst 
of all, and, if he catches you, he will kill you.”—“Let me stay! 
I’m not afraid of their killing me.” The seven robbers arrived. 
They said, “Yesterday there was one. To-day there are two.” 
With his machad’ the boy slashed at the robbers, and slashed and 
slashed until he had killed them all. He cut off the tips of their 
tongues, and tied them in a handkerchief. He sent the girl 
(menina) home, he told her not to tell who had saved her. She 
became dumb. 
Next day, early in the morning, Jon Porcero went to the well 
and found the dead robbers. He cut off the tips of the tongues 
of seven pigs, he took them to the king, he said it was he who had 
killed the robbers. The king sent his soldiers to find out if this 
was true. The soldiers found the robbers with the tips of their 
tongues cut off, they reported to the king that it was true. So the 
king made Jon Porcero one of his house-servants. In spite of this 
position, the princess always looked at him askance. When she 
had been dumb a year or more, the king had the drum beaten 
in his fortifications to announce that whoever should make his 
daughter speak or laugh, to him he would give half of his kingdom. 
Meanwhile the boy had gone off to war, to make war on seven 
nations. In each country he lost a horse, except in the seventh, 
where he had a horse that could run twenty miles without a drop 
of sweat. On his way back to the country of the princess he met a 
shepherd, from whom he bought a goat-skin to make a drum.
-P-A-G-E-290

Arrived in the city, he beat his drum to proclaim that he had 
returned victorious from the wars. The princess, who for over a 
year had not stirred, had only slept and eaten, as:soon as she 
heard the drum, began to move about as if she were crazy. As 
the boy approached, she moved faster and faster. When the 
drum stopped, she stopped. The king noticed the effect on her 
of the drum, and he sent his soldiers to bring the drummer to his 
house. When he arrived, she went to embrace him, saying that 
was her husband, the man who had saved her from the robbers. 
To convince the king, he showed him the tongue-tips; and the 
king and his soldiers went and fitted them into the mouths of 
the robbers. The boy married the princess, and enjoyed half 
of the kingdom. Jon Porcero the king sent back to his pig-sty. . 
The pigs began to bitehim. Their teeth had grown long, and they 
bit and bit and bit him into pieces.! 
88. THE TWO BROTHERS.? 
There was a man who had two sons,— one named Bejami, one 
named José. Bejami learned to be a goldsmith; José, a broom. 
maker. José married and had two sons. Then his wife died. 
He went out peddling his brooms, sometimes making a fiston® a 
day, sometimes half a tiston. He left his children behind, alone. 
In that city was a po/on-tree on which perched a golden bird. 
It was said that whoever killed the bird would find every morning 
two bars of gold under his pillow. Everybody had tried, without 
success, to shoot the bird. One day, after their father went out, 
the two children went under this po/on with a gun. One held it, 
the other pulled the trigger, they killed the bird. The children 
showed the bird to their father; he took it to his brother Bejami, 
the goldsmith. Bejami knew that whoever ate the liver of the 
bird would get two bars of gold every day, but he told José that 
the bird was not much good. “There’s not much gold in it; but 
leave it here, I'll see what I can make of it.” 
Then Bejami told his wife to hurry up and take out the liver, 
cook it, and give it tohim. She put it in the pot to cook. Just 
at that time the sons of the broom-maker went by, they went

into the kitchen and saw the piece of liver, they ate it. “‘ Wife, 
hurry up and give me the liver!” said Bejami. But when she 
looked in the pot, she found it empty. So she got a chicken and 
cooked it, and gave its liver to her husband. As soon as he ate 
the liver, he went to bed. After he had dozed off a while, he 
looked under the pillow, but he saw nothing there. “I guess it’s 
too early yet,” he said, and he went to sleep again. When he 
woke up, he looked again, but he found nothing. ‘ 
The two boys went to sleep; when they woke up, they found 
two gold bars under their pillow. They showed them to their 
father. “Give them to me, | will take them to my brother,” he 
said. ‘‘They are mostly brass,” said Bejami; “but, since I am a 
goldsmith, perhaps I can make something out of them.” Every 
morning the two boys found the two gold bars, and every day their 
father took them to his brother. His brother grew rich. 
After a time Bejami told José that his sons were enchanted. 
“The best thing for you to do is to part from them, otherwise both 
you and they will die.” And so José took the children out into 
the wilderness and left them. There a rich man happened to be 
out hunting. “‘What are you doing here?” he asked the children. 
“We are just having a good time,” they answered. “We are 
rich. We have no father or mother. We are looking for some 
one to be our father and mother.” The man took the children 
home with him; he said to his wife, “Wife, we have been married 
some time, and we have no children. God has sent us these 
children.” The woman was content. She took the boys: in, 
she sent them to school. 
One day, on their way home, one boy said to the other,‘ When 
mother gives us something to eat to-day, let us refuse it! We'll 
tell her we want to go out into the world.”—‘‘ Why don’t you eat?” 
asked the woman. ‘We don’t eat, because we want to go out 
into the world.”—“Eat, at any rate,” said the man, “then go if 
you like.” He gave them two suits of clothes just alike, and two 
horses just alike, and he gave each a clasp-knife. “You will go 
to cross-roads, where you will separate,” he said. “Stick these 
knives into a tree. If one of you returns to that place and sees 
the knife of the other rusty, he will know that his brother is in 
danger.” 
The boys set out, they arrived at the cross-roads. They stuck 
the knives into the tree; one went north, the other went south. 
The one who went north met a blacksmith. This blacksmith had
-P-A-G-E-292

a piece of iron on which he had worked, and before him his father 
and his grandfather, without making any impression. “Let me 
help you work that piece of iron!” said the boy; “I'll stay and 
work, you go to your breakfast.” While the smith was gone, the 
boy made picks, shovels, horseshoes, and all kinds of things, out 
of the iron, besides a man of iron that could work iron like a 
machine. When the smith returned and found all these things 
made, and a mian of iron.to help him, he was well satisfied. He 
offered the boy his shop to work in. “I want no shop,” answered 
the boy, “I have done these things just to help you.. All I want 
is a drink of water.”—“That I am very sorry I can’t give you,” 
said the smith. ‘‘The one thing we lack in this city is water. 
We get water only every six months. In the well is a dragon 
[ticha]. Every six months, to get water, we have to give the 
dragon in the well a person to devour.”—“‘Why don’t you kill 
that dragon?” asked the boy. ‘‘We can’t kill the dragon. Nor 
could our ancestors kill it.’"—‘‘Vll make myself a sword; and if 
you show me the well, Pll kill the dragon.” 
The very day they started for the well the king’s daughter was 
to be thrown in to the dragon. They found her there when they 
atrived. “I’m going to save you,” the boy said to her. ‘Tell 
me what sign the dragon gives as it comes up.”—“Go your way,” 
said the princess. “Don’t come here to suffer with me.”—“‘No, 
Y’m not going away, I’m going to save you. What sign does the 
dragon give?”—“It comes in thunder and lightning.” Soon it 
thundered and lightened, the water was troubled and became 
white, then blue, then red as blood. The dragon came up in the 
blood-red water. The boy took his sword and cut off the seven 
heads of the dragon. The princess rejoiced; she was safe, the 
city would now have an abundance of water. She took a ring, 
a betrothal ring, and gave it to him; she told him to cut off the tips 
of the seven tongues of the dragon and tie them up in the silk 
handkerchief she gave him. 
In the king’s palace was a pigherd. On this day he went to 
the well for water for his pigs, and there he found the beheaded 
dragon, “He took the heads to the king, he claimed that he killed 
the dragon. Now, the king had announced that whoever killed 
the dragon he would marry to the princess. When the king told the 
princess she was to marry the pigherd, she became dumb. The 
boy heard of this marriage; he wrote to the king, he told the 
king to ask the pigherd for the tips of the tongues of the dragon.
-P-A-G-E-293
266 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society. 
The pigherd told the king that he had beaten so hard on the heads 
of the dragon, he didn’t know what had become of the tips of the 
tongues. The king summoned the boy; the boy showed the seven 
tongue-tips, and the little ring the princess had given him. Then 
the king married him to the princess. 
This boy was a good huntsman, and he liked hunting. In front 
of the king’s house stood a goat on a flat stone. It had been there 
since the beginning of the world, and there it danced night and 
day without stopping. “Why does that goat dance night and day 
without stopping?” the boy asked the princess. “I don’t know,” 
she answered, “‘my ancestors found it there. People shoot at it 
without killing it. The goat runs away, and the huntsman runs 
after it. The goat returns, but the huntsman never returns.” — 
“T am going to get up early to-morrow to kill that goat.” —‘‘ Don’t 
undertake it!”’ begged the princess, ‘‘every one who has under- 
taken it is dead and gone.”—“I believe I can kill it,” he said. 
Next morning, when he shot at the goat, the goat ran, and he 
ran his horse after it. His dog was with him. They ran out into 
the wilds, where the goat was lost to sight. It was dark and cold, 
so he gathered brush and made a fire. As he was sitting by it, 
he looked up into the tree he was under, he saw in it an old woman. 
(She was the enchanted goat.) “Old woman, what are you doing 
up there?” he asked. ‘“‘I’m looking for the goat that was in the 
city.”—‘“‘I’m here for the same purpose,” he said. “I want to 
come down to you; but I can’t, because I’m afraid of your dog.” 
— ‘My dog won’t hurt you.”—‘‘Tie him up, I’m aftraid.”—‘I 
can’t tie him up, I’ve no rope.” —“‘There’s grass there, tie him 
with that.” He tied up the dog with a piece of grass. As soon 
as the old woman descended, the grass turned into a chain, and 
she turned them all — boy, horse, and dog — into stone. Then 
she turned back into a goat and returned to the city. Next day 
she was in her usual place, but the boy did not come back. They 
waited for him fifteen days, then they gave him up with the rest. 
Meanwhile the other brother returned to the cross-roads to 
find the clasp-knife rusty. He knew his brother Pedr’ was dead 
or in danger. He followed the road Pedr’ had taken. When he 
arrived in the city, he looked so much like Pedr’, that every one 
took him for his brother. ‘‘We told you not to meddle with that 
goat,” they said; “you are lucky to get back at all.” He merely 
listened to them without explaining. They took him to the 
king’s house, where, too, they thought he was the husband of the
-P-A-G-E-294

princess. “Didn’t I tell you not to meddle with that goat?” 
said the princess. ‘‘The goat was back thirty days ago, you are 
lucky to get back at all.”—‘‘That time I didn’t get the goat, but 
next time J’ll kill her.”—‘‘Don’t meddle with that goat, you may 
never come back.” —‘‘ To-morrow I am going to killher.”” He told 
the princess he wasn’t going to bed, he was going to stay up so as 
to get out very early to kill the goat. 
At three in the morning he went out and shot at the goat. The 
goat ran. With his dog, he ran his horse after it. The goat ran 
out to the same wild place, where it was dark and cold, and where 
he lighted a fire and sat down to warm himself. He looked up 
into the tree, he saw the old woman. “O my little son! what 
brings you here?” —‘“ The goat I shot at in the city ran here and 
disappeared.”——“‘T’m after it too,” said the old woman. ‘Tie 
up your dog, and I'l] come down and help you catch that goat.”— 
“T’ve never tied up my dog since I got him, and I’m not going to 
tie him up for you. Come down, or I'll kill you.”—‘‘My son, I 
only want to help you kill the goat, and here you are wanting to 
kill me.”—‘‘ Come down, my dog won’t touch you until I say so.” 
—“T won’t come down until you tie him up.”-——“If you don’t 
come down, I'll believe you are the goat yourself.”—‘Don’t I 
look like a person? Do I look like a goat?”——‘Come down, or 
I'll send my dog up after you.”” When she came down, he ordered 
her to show him his brother. “He has been here thirty days.”— 
“T don’t know anything about it. I’ve been here only four 
days.” —‘‘You are the goat. Unless you show me my brother, 
TU kill you.’—‘“‘Don’t kill me! Y'fl show you your brother, his 
horse, and his dog. That stone there is your brother; that, his 
horse; that, his dog.”——“Those are stones. It is my brother I 
want to see, his horse and his dog. Be quick, or I’ll kill you!” 
She took a switch and switched the three stones, they turned into 
the boy, his horse, and his dog. “I was in a deep sleep,” said 
Pedr’. “You were, indeed, in a deep sleep,” answered Paul’. 
“Had I not come here, you would never have waked up.” 
There were a million or more stones in that place, and Paul’ 
made the old woman transform them all back with her switch into 
people. One little stone she passed over. “Transform that stone 
too,” he said, “or I will kill you.” When she switched that 
stone, it became a girl of sixteen, her school-book open in her hand. 
All the disenchanted went their way, all but this girl, Paul’ told 
Pedr’ to take this girl up on his horse. ‘You are a married man,” ~
-P-A-G-E-295
268 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society. 
Paul’ said, “I will ride alone.” They killed the old woman, and 
they started for the city. 
On the way, Paul’ told Pedr’ how all in the city had mistaken 
him, including the princess. Pedr’ grew angry, disbelieving Paul’ 
when he said that he had not lain with the princess, and he killed 
him. Then he was remorseful, he took from his pocket a straw 
he had got from a rabbit’s nest, he put it up the nose of his brother, 
he brought him back to life. 
Arrived in the city, the king welcomed them, he gave a feast 
in their honor. To it came strangers from all over the world and 
from England. Among them were the mother and sister and 
brother of the young girl Paul’ had rescued. She had disappeared 
from home eight years before, when she was eight years old. Her 
sister recognized her by a little ring. They were all so pleased, 
they had a fresh feast, and Paul’ married thegirl. The goat never 
came back to that city. 
(Variant a.) 
There were a man and his wife. They had been married seven 
years, they had no children. For seven years the man had gone 
fishing without catching a fish. Then one day he caught a fish. 
The fish begged him to let it go. “I have been fishing seven 
years without catching a fish. You are the first fish I’ve caught. 
I’m not going to let you go.”—“‘Let me go,” begged the fish, “‘and 
every time you throw in your line, you'll catch a fish.” The man 
threw back the fish; then he began to take so many fish, he had to 
send them in with a wagon. He opened a fish-market, he got 
rich and built a house five stories high. At the end of three 
years he caught the same fish again. The fish said, ‘““To-day you 
take me home with you. Your wife will tell you she is going to 
dress me, but do you dress me yourself. Scale me and cut me 
open, and don’t let a drop of blood fall. Cut me in three pieces. 
Give one to your wife, one to your dog, and take one yourself. 
Throw the water you cook me in on your garden.” After a while 
the man’s wife gave birth to two boys; the man’s dog, to two 
puppies; and the man’s mare, to two foals.2. Hanging on the

The boys were named Paul’ and Pedr’. They went to school 
and learned all that was proper for boys to learn; but they were 
never let out from school or home. ‘‘Oh, but this world is a fine 
place!” one said to the other one day. “Let us ask father to let 
us go out into it!” When they asked him, at first their father 
sent them back to school; but then he reconsidered, he decided 
to let them go out into the world. To each he gave a horse and a 
dog and a sword. -He gave each, too, a little bottle.* They ran

they parted. 
Paul’ went on his way; he came to a well, where he met a prin- 
cess. ‘What are you doing here?” she asked. “Something is 
coming to kill me. Go your way, leave me alone to pay the 
penalty.”—‘‘ We are going to pay it together,” he answered. He 
laid his head in her lap, he went to sleep. He felt a drop of water 
on his face, he awoke to find her in tears. ‘“‘ Why do you weep?” — 
“That thing is coming now to kill me.” He cut off the seven

Salema.” When Lady Nhanha finds she is pregnant, she drives her from the house.

heads of the dragon (4icha), he cut out its seven tongues, he tied 
them up in a handkerchief. Then he sent the princess home to 
tell her father he was free now to draw water.! 
A servant of the king came to the well and found the heads of 
the dragon. He took them to the king, he said it was he who 
killed the dragon. ‘‘Where are the tongues?” asked the king. 
“T don’t know, they are lost,” answered the servant. The king 
planned to have the princess marry the servant. 
Paul’ wrote a letter to the princess and hung it to his dog’s neck. 
“You will meet a servant at the door,” he said to the dog. “‘Spit 
on his foot, go on, and take the princess the letter.” The king 
sent four soldiers after the dog to fetch his master and to ask him 
why he was impudent enough to send a dog to his house. ‘“‘T’ll 
go to the king of my own accord,” said Paul’. He gave the hand- 
kerchief with the tongues to the king; he said, “I was impudent 
enough to save the princess from the dragon, that’s why I was 
impudent enough to send my dog to your house.”? The king 
ordered the servant to the gallows, Paul’ he married to the prin- 
cess. 
On their way home from the wedding they passed a high house, 
the highest in the city. ‘‘Whose high house is that?” asked Paul’. 
“T don’t know,” answered the princess. “I’ve seen it all my life, 
but I don’t know to whom it belongs. I’ve heard that whoever 
enters it never comes out.” That night, when they went to 
bed, he placed a sword between himself and his wife, the sharp 
edge towards her.t ‘‘Why this sword?” she asked. “‘It is the 
custom in my country.” When she went to sleep, he got up and 
set out for the high house. He knocked; a voice said, “Come 
in!”—‘No, I can’t come in. I have no rope to tie my horse.” 
The witch inside threw down one of her body-hairs to tie the

horse. When Paul’ went in, they began to fight. ‘Advance, 
my horse!” cried Paul’. ‘“Thicken up, my hair!” cried the witch. 
The hair turned into a chain and chained up the horse. Then she 
killed Paul’. 
At this time Pedr’ looked at his bottle, he saw blood in it. He 
went in the direction his brother took, he reached the same city. 
When he arrived at the king’s house, the princess said to him, “O 
husband! since we have been married, we have lived like stran- 
gers.” On their way home they passed the high house, he asked 
her to whom it belonged. ‘I don’t know. I’ve seen it all my 
life, but I don’t know to whom it belongs. I’ve heard that who- 
ever enters it never comes out. You asked me that question 
before. Why do you ask it again?” Pedr’ began to think his 
brother must have been there. When he and the princess went 
to bed, he placed his sword between them. ‘‘Why this sword?” 
she asked. “It is the custom in my country.”—“That is what 
you answered when I asked you before.” Now Pedr’ was sure 
his brother had been there. 
When she fell asleep, he got up and went to the high house and 
knocked. “Come in!”—“No, I have no rope to tie my horse.” 
When she threw down a strand of hair, Pedr’ merely laid it on 
the back of his horse without tying it. Then he went indoors. 
He met a man, he struck him in the eye. Out flew the eye, it 
went up to the ceiling and then back again into its socket. He 
started to fight with the old witch. They fought and fought and 
fought until he was exhausted. “Advance, my horse!” he 
cried. “Thicken up, my hair!” she cried; but the hair only fell 
off the back of the horse, and the horse ran forward to help his 
master. Then they killed the old witch. 
Pedr’ told the man he would spare his life if he showed him his 
brother. The man showed him a trap-door, he let him down by a

horse is a diviner (dibinhador). He is faster than the wind. He flies into the air and 
drops down where Pedr’ wishes to be. He warns Pedr’, when he enters the house of the 
old witch and she shows him her treasures, to make light of them. When she shows Pedr’ 
her room of gold, he says, “That is nothing, my horse’s stall is like that.” To the room of 
silver he says, “That is like my horse’s manure-pit.” To the room of copper treasure he 
says, “That is like my dog-kennel.” The horse has warned him, too, against the con- 
sumidor. So there he strikes her with his sword; but he cannot kill her, because she has 
seven lives. In each of the seven corners of her high house is one of her lives. “Cut my 
throat,” she cries out; but the horse grabs her, and shakes her seven times. Every time 
he shakes her, down falls a corner of the house. When the house is down, she dies. (Cab 
Verde.)

rope. Pedr’ pulled Paul’ up. “T’ll leave you down there,” he 
called to the man, “unless you tell me where the witch keeps her 
ointment.” !—‘‘She keeps it above the door.” Pedr’ rubbed it 
on Paul’, he came to life. “I was in a deep sleep,” said Paul’. 
“You were dead, and to-day I revived you,” said Pedr’. Then 
they went out from the high house, leaving the man down in 
the pit. : 
On their way, when Paul’ heard Pedr’s story, he grew jealous 
and killed him. ‘“O Paul’!” said his wife when he returned to her, 
“how long we’ve been married! and I don’t know yet whether 
you area man or a woman.” ‘Then Paul’ felt remorse about his 
brother, he returned to the place where he killed him. He rubbed 
him with the ointment he felt in his pocket, he restored him to 
life. 
89. DUTIFUL AND UNDUTIFUL.? 
There was a woman had three sons. As she was dying, she 
called her sons to divide her property. To the eldest two she 
said, ‘‘What do you want me to leave you?” They said, “Money, 
because with money we can go where we wish.”” She asked Anton, 
the youngest (coude), what he wanted. He said, “I want your 
blessing.” 
There was misery in the land. The two sons with money went 
out and bought corn. As they were roasting it, the grains scat- 
tered. The youngest started to pick them up. They beat his 
hand with a stick, so that it swelled up. He left them, he walked 
and walked and walked. He met anold man. “Son, do you 
know who I am?” —“No.”—“I am San Anton, your godfather. 
Do you wish to live with me?”” He went to live with his god- 
father. One day his godfather found him weeping. “Why do 
you weep?” he asked. “I have reason to weep. Here I have all 
I want; but I don’t know how my brothers are faring.” —“Go 
and get your brothers to come here.” His godfather gave him a

by her on their way to the end of the world. (Cab’ Verde.)

little stone. ‘‘Go to the field, shut your eyes, and throw the stone 
at a horse. Ride the horse to find your brothers.’’ He went to 
the field, he threw the stone, but he took a horse the stone did not 
hit. “Did I not tell you to take the horse the stone should hit?” 
said his godfather. ‘‘That horse was Mind [Sensid’], this is 
Wind [Ven?’].” He wanted to go back to change the horse. 
“Too late,” said his godfather, “this horse you must keep.” 
He rode to the house of his brothers, he brought them back with 
him. San Anton asked the eldest, “‘What would you have me do 
for you?””—‘‘Give me a horse better than this, and.marry me to 
the handsomest woman in the world.” The second brother gave 
the same answer. The youngest said, “Build me a hut [func’], 
and marry me to the ugliest woman in the world. When I sleep 
in the hut, let it be head in and foot out.” 
After he lay down in the hut, an old man passed by and asked 
for shelter for the night. He was old, tired, a leper. The boy 
jumped out of the hut and offered it to the old man: “No,” said 
the old man, “I ama leper. It is catching.’”—“Go in. That isa 
disease from God. If I catch it, I shall not mind. It is a disease 
from God.” The old man said, “Go behind the hut, and you will 
find what I have brought.” He found a bundle of bedding. He 
brought it in and made a bed for the old man. The next morning 
the old man said, “I am God. Iam going up to heaven.” The 
boy found a bag of money God had left back of the hut. The boy 
said, “He left his money. I am going to take it tohim.” When 
God reached heaven, he found Anton there with the money. “I 
left it for you,” said God; “but if you don’t want it, give it back.” 
God sent him down to his godfather’s. 
His godfather said, “Call your brothers. I have a message 
tor them to carry to God.” The eldest brother mounted his horse 
and started for heaven. He met a washerwoman with a child. 
The child was crying. “Sir, give me a piece of bread for the 
child! Heishungry.” Hesaid, ‘“‘Givehim what youhave. If he 
doesn’t like it, let him cry.” She said, “A black chicken go ahead 
of you! [Galinha pret’ ba bu diante!| Find nothing you wish!”

to take, he did not know. He put his note under a stone at the 
cross-road, he turned back. San Anton asked if God had sent an 
answer. He said, ““He was busy, and sent no answer.” 
San Anton called the second brother, he sent him with a note 
to God. He met the washerwoman with a child. The child was 
crying. “Sir, give me a piece of bread for the child! He is hun- 
gry.” He said, “Give him what you have. If he doesn’t like it, 
let him cry.” She said, “A black chicken go ahead of you!

note under a stone at the cross-road, he turned back. San Anton 
asked. if God had sent an answer. He said, “He was busy, and 
sent no answer.” 
San Anton called the youngest. “Take this note toGod.” He 
rode forth. He met the washerwoman. She said, “‘Sir, give me a 
piece of bread for the child!” He jumped down from his horse, 
he broke his bread in halves, he gave her a half. She asked him 
not to give so much, but he would give it. When he left her, she 
said, ‘A white chicken go ahead of you! Whatever you wish, 
may you encounter!” He came toa brook of milk. He spurred 
his horse across. He came to a brook of blood. He spurred 
across. He came to the cross-roads. He said, “Go, go up, up! 
The word of God does not lie [Palabra de Deus ca ta minti].” He 
was at once with God. He handed him the note. There he staid 
for a thousand years. Then God told him to go down to San 
Anton. “He may want you.”—~‘I came here but yesterday, and 
to-day you are sending me back?”—‘‘You have been here a 
thousand years. San Anton may want you. Your two brothers 
will die and go to hell [nfern’]. You will die and come up here.” 
He went back to San Anton, and gave him God’s answer. His 
two brothers died, and went to hell. He died, and went to heaven. 
When he arrived, there at the door was San Pedr’. He jumped 
and sat down on San Pedr’s chair. San Pedr’ tried to get him up. 
“No,” said San Anton; “that is the blessing I gave him, from the 
seat he sits down in, nobody may make him get up.”

gO. THE PRINCESS WHO GROANS. 
There was a king, he had a princely son. The day the prince 
was born, a cousin was born likewise. One was called Prince Don 
Pedr’, his cousin was called Good-Friend. They grew up together. 
When the prince was fifteen years of age, he slept one night, and 
dreamed of an enchanted princess at the bottom of the sea who 
was called Aldraba Juliana. In the morning the servant took him 
breakfast, he ate no breakfast. She took him dinner, he ate no 
dinner. She took him supper, he ate no supper. Well, his father 
came to ask him what was the matter with him that he did not eat. 
He told him how he dreamed of the enchanted princess at the 
bottom of the sea who was called Aldraba Juliana, how he would 
not eat or drink if he did not see her. The king told him to eat 
and drink, he would let him see her. 
The king went to a saiéo, he asked him what he should do for 
the prince to see that princess. The saibo gave him a bottle of 
sweet-oil. He said, “Give him a kerchief the color of the sky, 
one the color of the stars, one the color of the moon, and give 
him, too, a horse; let him mount this horse and go to the side of 
the sea; let him drop in half of this oil; let him say to the sea, 
‘Open in front, close behind;’ the first house he comes to will be 
the house of the enchanted princess; let him run his horse, up and 
down; when he stops at the door of the house, let him ask the 
servant for a drink; when he drinks, let him pull out the kerchief 
the color of the sky to wipe his mouth.” 
Well, after that he ate, he drank. The king gave him a horse, 
the three kerchiefs, and the bottle of oil. He went to the sea, 
he dropped in half [of the oil]; he said to the sea, “‘Open in front, 
close behind.” He sped on seven days and seven nights. On the 
eighth day he came to a house. He ran his horse, he went up and 
down. He stopped at the door of the house, he asked the servant 
for a drink. The servant went in to tell the mistress that a man 
stood at the door asking for a drink. The mistress said to her, 
“Put the water in the leaf cup, give hima drink.” When he drank, 
he took out a kerchief the color of the sky, he wiped his mouth. 
The servant ran in. She said to her mistress, “Your kerchiefs 
are pretty, but there is one prettier than all those which you have.” 
The princess said to her, “Go ask him to sell it to me.” When the

servant spoke to him, he said to her, “What is a kerchief, that I 
should sell it to her?’ Take it, carry it to her.” 
He ran his horse; again he went up, he came down. Again he 
asked the servant for a drink. The mistress told the servant to 
give him a drink in a cup. When he drank, he took out the 
kerchief the color of the stars, he wiped his mouth. The servant 
ran in such haste, that she broke the cup; she said, “‘ Mistress, if 
that kerchief was pretty, this one is more than pretty.” —“‘Go ask 
him to sell it to me.” The servant said to him, “‘Mistress says 
for you to sell that kerchief.”” He said to her, ‘What is a ker- 
chief, that I should sell it? Take it, carry it to her.” 
The prince ran his horse; again he went up, he came down, he 
asked the servant for a drink. The lady said, “Put water in my 
cup of silver, give him a drink.” When he drank, he took out the 
kerchief the color of the moon, he wiped his mouth. The servant 
ran so hard, that she broke a leg and did not feel it. ‘‘Mistress, 
those two are nothing, if you saw this one. It is the prettiest 
thing I have seen in the world.”’ She said to her, “Go ask him to 
sell it to me.”” She said to the prince, “‘Mistress says for you to 
sell her this, kerchief.”” The prince said to her, ‘What is a ker- 
chief, that I should sell it to her? Go tell her that for her to get 
it, my hand has only to be in hers.” When she told her mistress, 
she said, “Stretch out your hand from that window, he will reach 
it to you.” When the princess stretched out her hand to take it, 
the prince took her by the hand, pulled her out, put her on the 
seat of hishorse. He poured out the rest of the oil; he said, “Sea, 
open in front, close behind.” 
The princess gave a groan at the door of her house, she gave a 
groan in the middle of the sea, she gave another at the shore of 
the sea. When he arrived with her, the princess became dumb, 
she would not talk. He went again to the saibo, he asked him 
if there was not something that would make her talk. The saibo 
gave him a violin. He said to him, “‘Go with this violin. When 
you reach the door, tune it up, she will smile; play it, she will 
sing.” When the prince reached the door, he tuned up the violin, 
the princess smiled; he played it, the princess spoke; she said 
to him, ‘‘The three groans that I gave — the one at the door of 
my house was [for] my servant whom I left behind, the one in the 
middle of the sea was [for] my sewing-basket which I left behind, 
the groan which I gave at the shore of the sea was [for] the seat 
which I have sat in since I was born, that the sun might not shine

on me that made you a sinner to take me from there.” Then the 
prince went back, he went to get her servant and her sewing- 
basket. He returned. They got married. They published with 
seven priests, married with twenty-one. To this day he is king 
of the sea besides the land. 
91. DUTIFUL AND UNDUTIFUL: THE PRINCESS WHO GROANS! 
There was a man who had three sons,— Paul’, Anton, and Pedr’. 
One day Paul’ asked his father to let him go out to catch a wild 
horse. “Do you want my blessing,? or cuscus?”? asked the 
father. “Cuscus.’ On his way he met an old woman with a 
child crying from hunger. ‘“‘Give me some of your cuscus for my 
child,” said the old woman. (That was Santa Maria.) “If one 
of us has to die of hunger, let the child die,” answered Paul’. 
He went a little farther, he met an old man. (That was God.) 
The old man asked him to let him hold on to the tail of his horse 
to help himself along. He dismounted and gave the old man a 
beating. The old man picked up a little stone and gave it to him. 
“When you reach the horses,” said the old man, “shut your eyes 
and throw the stone. The horse you hit, you take.” 
Next day Anton asked his father to let him go out for a horse. 
“Your brother Paul’ went, and hasn’t come back,” said his father; 
“Sf you go, you won’t come back, either.” But Anton insisted. 
“Do you want my blessing, or cuscus?”—“Cuscus.” On his way 
he met the old woman with the little child crying from hunger. 
“Give me some of your cuscus for my child.”—“If one of us has to 
die of hunger, let the child die,” answered Anton. He went a 
little farther, he met the old man. ‘‘Let me hold on to the tail 
of your horse.” He dismounted and beat the old man. ‘‘Take 
this stone,” said the old man, ‘“‘shut your eyes, and throw the 
stone. The horse you hit, you take.” 
Next day Pedr’ asked his father to let him go out for a horse. 
“Your two brothers went, they have not come back. If you go, 
you won’t come back, either.” But Pedr’ insisted. “Do you 
want my blessing, or cuseus?”—“Your blessing.” His father

blessed him, he gave him cuscus too. On his way he met the old 
woman with the child. ‘‘Give me some of your cuscus for my 
child.” He broke his cuscus, he gave half of it to the old woman. 
“Y’m a grown man; I can stand hunger, but the child can’t.” 
He went on, he met the old man. “Let me hold on to the tail 
of your horse.” —‘‘Get up on my horse,” said Pedr’. On top of 
the hill the old man got down and gave Pedr’ a little stone. 
“Take this stone, shut your eyes, throw the stone. The horse 
you hit, you take.” 
When Pedr’ reached the horses, he found that his brothers had 
picked out the finest two horses in the herd. He closed his eyes, 
he threw the little stone, he took the horse it hit. That horse was 
the poorest creature there. ‘“He’s crazy to take that horse,” 
exclaimed his brothers, and they rode home ahead of him. His 
horse was so poor, it took him three days to reach home. 
After he had put up his horse and gone to bed, he heard his 
horse whinnying. Thinking his brothers’ horses might have 
attacked his, he got up and went into the stable. As he opened 
the door, the light from the horse almost blinded him. He took 
out the horse, he rode past the king’s house. “Sell me your 
horse,” said the king. “I will serve you,” he said, “but my horse 
is to serve me.”—“If you are bold enough to say that, you are 
bold enough to rescue my daughter from her enchantment,” 
said the king. Pedr’ began to weep. “If you weep like that,” 
said the horse, “you will kill me.’—“I have a right to weep. 
The king wanted to buy you from me; but I said to him, ‘I will 
serve you, but my horse is to serve me.” Then he said, ‘If you are 
bold enough to say that, you are bold enough to rescue my 
daughter from her enchantment.’ ”’—‘‘That is nothing,” said the 
horse. ‘Tell the king to give you a bottle of oil and three 
handkerchiefs,— one the color of the sky, one the color of the 
earth, one the color of the sea! Go to the shore, drop the oil in 
the sea, say, ‘Open in front, shut behind.’ ” 
When Pedr’ reached the enchanted country at the bottom of the 
sea, he met a servant of the king, he asked her for a drink of water. 
“There is a man ? outside asking for a drink of water,” the servant 
said to the princess. ‘‘Take my copper cup, get water out of my 
pot, give him a drink,” ordered the princess. Pedr’ drank, he 
pulled out his handkerchief the color of the sky to wipe his mouth.

The servant said that the man had a handkerchief the like of 
which she had never seen before. The princess sent back the 
servant to ask the man to sellit to her. ‘What is a handkerchief, 
that I should sell it?” said Pedr’, and he gave it to the servant. 
He went away, he returned and asked again for a drink of water. 
The servant told the princess. “Take my silver cup and give 
him a drink,” ordered the princess. Pedr’ drank, he pulled out 
his handkerchief the color of the earth. The servant said that 
this handkerchief was even finer than the other. The princess 
sent her to buy it. ‘‘What is a handkerchief, that I should sell 
it?” said Pedr’, and he gave it to the servant. He went away, 
he returned, he asked again for a drink of water. “Take my gold 
cup and give him a drink,” ordered the princess. Pedr’ drank, 
he pulled out his handkerchief the color of the sea. The servant 
ran back in such haste, that she fell down and broke her leg.! 
“Compared with this handkerchief, the others are as nothing,” 
she said. The princess sent her to buy it. ‘No, I can’t sell this 
handkerchief,” said Pedr’. ‘‘T will give it to her, but I must give 
it with my own hand.” The princess sent word to him that she 
could not come out, for she had been charged by her mother never 
to get up from the seat she sat on? “Let her stretch her hand 
out through the window, and I’ll give her the handkerchief,” 
said Pedr’, The princess stretched out her hand, Pedr’ grabbed 
it, he pulled her out through the window, he put her on his horse. 
“Ai!” groaned the princess at the door. “Ai!” she groaned 
in mid-ocean. “Ai!” she groaned again on landing. Then she 
became dumb. “Sell me your horse,” the king again asked Pedr’. 
“T will serve you, but my horse is to serve me.” —“If you are bold 
enough to say that, you are bold enough to make my daughter 
speak,” said the king. Pedr’ began to weep. “If you weep like 
that, you will kill me,” said the horse. “I have a right to weep. 
The king wanted to buy you from me; but I said, ‘I will serve 
you, but my horse is to serve me.’ Then he said, ‘If you are bold 
enough to say that, you are bold enough to make my daughter 
speak.’”—“That is nothing,” said the horse. ‘Ask the king to 
give you three pieces of grape-vine and the best viola in Lisbon.”

Pedr’ put a piece of grape-vine on the table, he began to play 
his viola, he sang, — 
“Dona Juliana, enchanted in the depths of the sea, 
Tell me, that first groan, for what was it?” 
She smiled. He put down the second piece of grape-vine, and 
sang,— 
“Dona Juliana, enchanted in the depths of the sea, 
Tell me, that second groan, for what was it?” 
She laughed. He put down the third piece of grape-vine, and 
sang,— 
“Dona Juliana, enchanted in the depths of the sea, 
Tell me, that third groan, for what was it?” — 
“The first groan was for leaving the seat my mother wished me on; 
the second groan was for dropping my ring in the sea; the third 
groan was for the servant I left behind.” 
The king rejoiced that his daughter could speak. But again. 
he said to Pedr’, “Sell me your horse.” —“I will serve you, but my 
horse is to serve me.”’—“‘If you are bold enough to say that, you 
are bold enough to bring to my daughter the servant she left 
behind.” Pedr’ began to weep. “If you weep like that, you 
will kill me,” said the horse. “I havea right to weep. The king 
wanted to buy you from me; but I said, ‘I will serve you, but my 
horse is to serve me.’ Then he said, ‘If you are bold enough to 
say that, you are bold enough to bring to my daughter the 
servant she left behind.’”—“That is nothing,” said the horse. 
“Ask the king for a bottle of oil, throw the oil in the water, say, 
“Open in front, shut behind.’” 
The king was glad to have the servant, but again he asked 
Pedr’ to sell him his horse. “I will serve you, but my horse is to 
serve me.”—“If you are bold enough to say that, you are bold 
enough to bring to my daughter the ring she dropped in the sea.” 
Pedr’ began to weep. “If you weep like that, you will kill me,” 
said the horse. “I have a right to weep. The king wanted to 
buy you from me; but I said, ‘I will serve you, but my horse is to 
serve me.’ Then he said, ‘If you are bold enough to say that, 
you are bold enough to bring to my daughter the ring she dropped 
in the sea.’”—‘‘That is nothing,” said the horse. “Sharpen your

If you cut off his head with your sword, in his belly you will find

married him to the princess. The marriage was published by 
twenty-four priests, and performed by forty-eight. 
92. THE PRINCESS WHO GROANS: MAN OR WOMAN?? 
Aldraga Jiliana enchanted at the bottom 
of the sea, seven towers of Babel, who lives 
on the Gold Mountain,— a place where no 
male fly ever goes, much less a split of a 
human.? 
There was a king who had a son called Bonito. One night he 
went to sleep, he dreamed of Aldraga Jiliana. When in the 
morning the servant brought him coffee, he did not take it. She 
brought him breakfast; when she came, she found the coffee 
there. She went back, she told the mother of Bonito that she 
brought him coffee, he did not take it; she brought him breakfast, 
he did not eat breakfast. Then the queen went to tell Sir King. 
The king sent to call him, to ask him what was the matter with 
him, that she brought him coffee and he did not take it, she 
brought him breakfast and he did not eat breakfast. He said to 
the king, “‘ You may well ask why he [I] dreamed of the most beauti- 
ful face in the world, which was called Aldraga Jiliana enchanted 
at the bottom of the sea, seven towers of Babel, who lives on the 
Gold Mountain, where no male fly ever goes, much less a split of a 
human.” He told the king that he was going to find this woman. 
The king asked how he was going there, the sea had no path. 
This prince had an enchanted horse. He went to his horse. 
The horse told him to ask the king to give him a handful of salt, 
with three kerchiefs of silk, —one the color of the stars, one the 
color of the moon, one the color of the sea. He took the salt and

bed; the third, for the servant left behind. The horse takes Pedr’ to a fisherman at the 
bottom of the sea, and from him he buys the fish which has swallowed the ring. Then at 
the door of the princess’s house Pedr’ speaks three times, without getting an answer, to the 
servant she left behind. The horse shakes his mane, and Pedr’ pulls the servant up on his 
horse. The servant has in her hands the basket from the head of the bed. ;

the kerchiefs, he got on his horse, he told the king that he was 
going to the Gold Mountain. The king said to him, “How are 
you going there? It is a place where no male fly ever goes, much 
less a split of a human.” He went to get the blessing of his father 
and mother for him to go to the Gold Mountain. They said, 
“What do you want us to give you, because we shall never see 
you again?” He said to them that he wanted nothing but their 
blessing; with faith in God, he would come back, Aldraga Jiliana 
with him. 
He got on his horse. The horse said to him, “‘When we go to 
the side of the sea, when I am there, give me the spur, throw in the 
handful of salt, tell the sea to open in front; you follow.” On his 
road for three days, three nights he met not [even] a bird flying. 
On the fourth day in the morning he stood at the foot of Gold 
Mountain. He got discouraged. He said to his horse that they 
saw not a single fisherman, he believed that they were lost in the 
world. The horse said to him that they were near Gold Moun- 
tain. “At about nine o’clock you will meet a man who will give 
you news of Gold Mountain, but he will tell you that there goes 
neither male nor female.” 
Then he went on, he came toa house. He ran his horse, he went 
up, he came down, he stopped at the door. The servant came to 
the door, he asked him for a drink. The servant said, “Nha- 
nha, there is a man here at the door asking me for a drink.’ 
She said to the servant, “Take the cup with a handle, give him a 
drink.” When he drank, he drew out the kerchief the color of 
the sea, he wiped his mouth. The servant went in. She said, 
“Nhanh4, that man has a kerchief, the prettiest thing in the 
world.” She said, “Go ask him to sell it to me.” The man said, 
“Take it to her. Say to her, ‘What is a kerchief, that I should 
sell it to her?’” He turned, he ran his horse. He went, he 
turned back; he said to the servant, “Do me the favor to give me 
a drink, because I have travelled a long road, I am very thirsty.” 
The lady said, “Take my silver cup, give him a drink.” When he 
drank, he drew out the kerchief the color of the stars, he wiped his 
mouth. The servant ran in. She said, “O Nhanha! if that 
kerchief was pretty, this one is still prettier.” She said, “Go ask 
him to sell it to me for any money whatsoever, I will buy it from 
him.” The prince said to her, ‘What is a kerchief, that I should 
sell it to her? Take it, carry it to her.” He ran his horse, he 
went down, he went up; he said to the servant again, “Do me
-P-A-G-E-310
Folk-Lore from the Cape Verde Islands. 283 
the favor to give me a drink, because I came by a very long road. 
It is the last time that I have to go on my road.” ‘The servant 
said, “’Nha nhanha, he asks for a drink; he says that it is the last 
time that I have to give him a drink for him to go on his road, 
because he has a very long road.” She said, “Go take my gold 
cup, take it to him to drink.” When he drank, he took out the 
kerchief the color of the moon, he wiped his mouth. The servant 
flew, she went before her mistress; she said, ““O ’nha nhanh’! this 
is prettier than the other two. Giveit tome.” ”’Nhanhanh’ said 
to her, “Go tell him to sell it to me for any money whatsoever, I 
will buy it from him.” The man said, “Go say to her, ‘What is a 
kerchief, that I should sell it to her?’ But this is [a question of] 
hand of white with white.” ’Nha nhanh’ said that then she must 
do without it, because her mother and her father put a charge 
upon her that the seat she sat in she was not to rise from. She 
sent the servant to ask the man his name. He said to her, ““My 
name is Marco, son of the King of Mouro Grande.” She said to 
him, “’Nha nhanh’ asks if you will not sell her that kerchief?” 
He said to her, ‘‘This kerchief is only from white hand to white 
hand; if she will not stand, let her but stretch out her hand at the 
window, my hand to her hand.” The servant said, “‘’Nha nhanh’, 
the two you have are for me, they are worth nothing in comparison 
with this. I will carry you. You will stretch your hand out of 
the window. You will take it.” The servant carried her. She 
stretched her hand out of the window. When she stretched out 
her hand, the prince pulled her out, he put her on the seat of 
his horse. 
She uttered a groan at the door of her house, an exclamation! 
at the wash of the water, a groan in the middle of the sea. When 
they reached the house of the king, the girl staid without speaking. 
There was none to make her speak. There came three princes, 
none could make her speak. Then the king announced? that 
whoever should make speak Aldraga Jiliana enchanted in the depth 
of the sea, seven towers of Babel, who lives on the Gold Moun- 
tain, where no male fly ever goes, much less a split of a human,— 
to him he would marry her. 
Then came Marco, he had an enchanted mule. He sat down 
in front of his mule. His mule said to him, “This is nothing. 
1 “Ail” is the exclamation itself.

The queen is after you to kill you; but, whatever she says to you, 
do you tell me; I will save you.” He came; he said, “I am 
Marco. I have the loyalty! to make speak Aldraga Jiliana 
enchanted in the depth of the sea, seven towers of Babel, who 
lives on Gold Mountain,—-a place where no male fly ever goes, 
much less a split of a human.” The mule said to him, “Go, tell 
him to give you a store [i.e., permission to go into store to pick up 
three violins. The first you take, you tune; she will look at you. 
When she looks at you, put it down there, take another, tune it, 
she will smile. Put it down, take the other. When you take the 
other, she will speak.” 
When she spoke, she said, “That ‘az!’ I uttered at the door 
of my house was for my servant who staid behind, the groan I 
gave at the wash of the water was for the hand of people I did not 
know, the groan I gave in the middle of the sea was for my souvenir 
ring which dropped there.” 
The queen said to the king that he had made her talk, but he 
was not aman. The king said, “He is a man, the lord of men.” 
The queen said, ‘He is a woman, the mistress of women.” The 
queen said to him, ‘‘Marco, you who have the loyalty to make her 
talk, you have the loyalty to take a grape-vine cutting, to plant it, 
to trim it back to bear grapes, to give wine to serve at breakfast- 
time.” He went and sat down in front of his mule and cried. 
The mule asked him, “What is the matter with you, that you are 
erying?”—“You may well ask, because my queen has given me a 
grape-vine cutting to plant, to trim it back to bear grapes, to make 
wine to serve at breakfast-time.” She said, “That is nothing.” 
She took a dry grape-vine cutting, she planted it, she trimmed it 
back; she took the grapes, she pressed them, she made wine to 
serve for breakfast. 
The king said to the queen, “I told you that he was a man, the 
lord of men.” The queen said, “He is a woman, the mistress of 
women. If you want to know that he is a woman, to-morrow he 
will go to a farm along with Bonito, for you to see that he is a 
woman.” He went and sat down, crying, in front of his mule. 
The mule said to him, “Why are you crying?” He said to her, 
“To-morrow the queen is going to send me with Bonito.” The 
mule said, “When you go, don’t take the fruit of women, take 
only that of men.” When they arrived, Bonito took quince, 
apple, grapes, every kind of fruit; but he took only two apples, 
1 An instance of the misapplication of a word not understood,

he took them in his hand. Bonito said to him, “Take grapes and 
other fruit.” He said, ““No, I don’t like fruit.. These two apples 
are enough.” They went home. Bonito said to the king, “He 
js a man, lord of men, he took no fruit of women.” 
The king sent to call the queen. He said to her, “I told you 
that he was a man, lord of men.” The queen said, “He is a 
woman, mistress of women. If you want to know, to-morrow he 
is going to bathe in the sea with Bonito. You will know if he is a 
woman or not a woman.” When morning broke, he went to his 
mule, he told her that they were sending him to the sea to bathe 
with Bonito. The mule said to him, “Still that is nothing. To- 
morrow, when you go, tie me loose, I will escape. I will fight 
with his horse, I will kill him, he will get upset. You will not 
bathe, you will come home.” When they went to bathe, he tied 
their horses. When they undressed, and there were only the 
drawers to take off, the mule of Marco escaped, she killed the 
horse of Bonito. Bonito was upset. They did not bathe, they 
went home. Bonito said to the king, “My mother is strong- 
headed. He is a man, lord of men. We undressed to our draw- 
ers. His mule escaped, fought with my horse, killed it. My 
mother only was back of this.” He called the queen. He said, 
“See what you have done untimely, only for his mule to kill the 
horse of Bonito. He is a man, lord of men.” The queen said, 
“T told you he was a woman, mistress of women.” 
The king said, “If he is 2 woman, I shall know, because I shall 
marry him to-day.” The king published him with fourteen 
priests, he married him with seventeen. After they were married, 
the feast was over, the time came to go to bed, they went to the 
place where they were going to sleep. The queen sent a servant 
to listen well. She sat, sat, sat. When it came to be the very 
middle of the night, she heard Aldraga call her husband Marco. 
She said, “Come, let us lie down, because I come from a country 
where woman marries woman.” The servant gave a jump to go 
and inform the queen that he was a woman. She went in such 
haste, that she broke all the teeth she had in her mouth. She 
said, “Lady Queen, he is a woman, mistress of women, because I 
heard her call to her; she said for them to lie down, because she 
‘came from a country where woman married woman.” The queen 
said to the king, “Didn’t I tell you that he was a woman?” 
Then they planned to go and kill Marco in the morning. Marco 
was very sad; he was thinking about it, when, in the middle of
-P-A-G-E-313

the night, he heard some one at the door; he called, ‘Marta, 
Marta!” He listened. As he listened, he said to him, “‘Do you 
know who is talking to you?” He said, “No.” He said, “J am 
your San Pedro, your godfather. I came to save you, because 
they are coming to kill you in the morning. I came to put on 
you, all finished, what a man has.” Then he became a man, 
withal. He said to him, “Stand behind the door, because they 
are coming to kill you.” He stood behind the door. When the 
queen came with a troop, she came in the lead. When they 
arrived, the queen turned to open the door. Marco took his male 
organ, he gave it to the queen in the mouth, he broke all the teeth 
in her mouth.

(Variant a: Man or Woman) 
There was a man married toa woman. He was a commandant. 
The week after he was married he went to war. The woman was 
pregnant. The man was away at war for eighteen years. When 
he returned home, his girl was seventeen years old and some months. 
The girl asked her father if he had won the war. He said no, he 
had to go back to the war. The girl had had every kind of an 
education. She said, ‘‘My father must rest. I am going to the 
war.” He said, “A woman never goes to war.”” Still she wanted 
to go. He said to her, “My daughter, you have pretty hair, 
they will know from it that you are a woman.”—“Father, get 
scissors and comb, and cut off my hair, that they may not know me 
from my hair.”—‘“‘My daughter, you have pretty hands.”— 
“Father, get me gloves, that they may not know me from my 
hands.”—“‘My daughter, you have pretty feet.”-—‘Father, get 
me boots, that they may not know me from my feet.’”—‘“My 
daughter, you have pretty eyes.” —“ When they look at me, I will 
look at the ground, that they may not know me from my eyes.”— 
“My daughter, you have breasts.”—‘“Father, get me a vest

[collete|, that they may not know me from my breasts.” He saw 
that he could not stop her, so he got all the things she asked for. 
The next day she went to the war. Within twenty-four hours 
she won the war. 
In the fight there was a prince. He told his father that a boy 
came on to the battlefield whose eyes looked like a woman’s, but 
who was not a woman. His father said, “Take him to a house 
where there are beads, ribbons, andasword. If he takes the beads 
or ribbons, he is a woman; if the sword,a man.” The prince took 
her to the house, she chose the sword; she said, “I won the battle 
in twenty-four hours. Had I had a sword like this in my hand, I 
would have won in one hour.” The prince told this to his father. 
His father said, “Invite him to dinner. Place two sets of chairs,— 
one set high, one set low. If he takes the high chair, he is a 
man; the low chair,a woman.” The prince invited her to dinner, 
she went straight to the highest chair in the room. The prince 
told this to his father. His father said to him, “Invite the boy 
to sleep with you. If you don’t learn then whether he is a man 
or woman, there is no way for you to learn.” The boy invited her 
to his room. She went into his room, he went out. He returned, 
he found her still up at eleven o’clock. He said, “Why don’t you 
go to bed? Isn’t the bed good enough for you?”—‘My father 
taught me to lie down from seven to eleven, and from eleven to 
four to study my books. Have you any books here?”—‘I have 
any book you want.” He gave her a book, she studied until 
morning. The boy told his father he could not find out. The 
father said, “Invite him to go bathing with you.” He invited 
her to go bathing. She wrote two letters of mourning (/u/’) and 
put them in her pocket. They rode their horses to the place they 
were going to bathe. He took off his clothes and went into the 
water. The girl pulled the two letters from her pocket, she read 
them, she began to cry. He saw her crying; he said, “Isn’t the 
water good enough for you to bathe in?”—‘Pardon me. Just 
now there passed overhead two birds who dropped these two 
letters saying that my mother and father had died to-day. I have 
to do what I can to reach home to-day.” The boy said to her, “I 
am going with you to your house.” As they came near the house, 
her mother and father were sitting at the window. She said to 
them, “Father and mother, I left a virgin [perfeital, and a virgin I 
return.” Then the boy knew! that she was a girl.

93. HALF-wiT 
There was a man who worked in a refinery. He had a half- 
witted son. The man stole some of the molasses. He put it into 
a gourd, he gave it to his son to sell. He said to him, “Sell it to 
somebody who doesn’t talk.” The boy. took the gourd. He 
went, he asked the first person he met if he wanted to buy molasses. 
“For how much?” he asked him. “Oh, I will not sell it to you,” 
the boy answered. ‘You talk. My father told me to sell it to 
somebody who does not talk.” He went, he met another person. 
“Buy molasses?”—‘‘For how much?”—“Oh, I can’t sell it to 
you. You talk.” After this had happened with several persons, 
he went out into the country beyond where people lived. There 
he met a dog. “Eh, sir, do you want to buy molasses?” The 
dog did not speak. He said to him, “Buy molasses? Buy 
molasses?” The dog did not speak. ‘‘You are he [to whom] my 
father wants me to sell the molasses.” He poured the molasses 
on the ground. The dog began to lick it up. “Now you've got 
the molasses, to-morrow I'll come for the money.” The boy went 
home. His father asked him if he had sold the molasses. “‘Yes, 
father. I walked, walked, walked, until I was tired, but finally I 
found a fellow who did not talk. I spoke to him three times, he 
did not answer. To-morrow I’m going to get the money from 
him.” —‘‘ Will you know him again if you see him?”—‘ Yes, I'll 
know him.”—‘‘Good! That’s the man J’ll sell molasses to every 
day.” Next day the boy went to the same place; but the dog 
was gone, the spot was covered with ants and flies. The boy 
asked them, ‘“‘ Where is that fellow to whom I sold the molasses?” 
They did not answer. The boy got angry. He took a stick, he 
killed them. When the boy went home, he said to his father, 
“That man to whom I sold the molasses was not there, only ants 
and flies were there. When I asked them where was the man I 
sold molasses to, they did not answer.” His father answered, 
“You are a fool! To whom did you sell the molasses?”’ Just 
then a dog like the dog he sold the molasses to passed by the door. 
“That dog looks like the fellow I sold the molasses to,” said the 
boy. Then his father knew that he was crazy. He kept asking 
what he should do to him. His father said, to get rid of him, 
“Go collect the money from him.” He ran after the dog that had

passed by, he began to beat him. A man asked him, “Why are 
you beating that dog?”—‘‘Because I sold molasses to one like 
him, and he didn’t pay me.” From that time until to-day the 
boy has beaten every dog and killed every fly that he has seen. 
One time he came to a king’s house, he went in. The king 
asked him, ‘‘What do you want?”—“T have come to tell you that 
I sold some molasses to a dog; and when I went for the money, 
he was not there, he had gone. Ants and flies were eating it all 
up.” The king saw that he was crazy. To get rid of him, he 
said, “Wherever you see a fly, kill it.” At that moment a fly 
alighted on the king’s head. The boy smacked it; he knocked 
down the king. The guards rushed up to arrest the boy and take 
him to prison. The king said, “Let him alone. He was only 
carrying out my orders.” And the king kept him in the palace 
as an example of how a fool will often make of a wise man a fool. 
94. CARL’, LEIT’, LIAMOR.! 
There was a country where a monkey used to steal girls. He 
would carry them off to the rocks. There he would leave them 
with a spinning-wheel and a guitar to divert themselves with. 
There was a woman who had a very pretty daughter called Maria. 
Her father was called Bianinha. One day, when the woman came 
home from work tired, she went out at once to pound. Maria 
said to her, “Mamma, can’t I help you pound?” Her mother 
answered her, “No, if you come out here, I’m afraid I’ll lose you.” 
Nevertheless the girl went out to the mortar. She had pounded 
but once, when the monkey ran up, he seized her, he carried her off 
to the rocks. There was a rock which everybody passed on their 
way tochurch. The king passed by, Maria called to him to come 
and entertain her. He answered, “I am not impudent enough to 
go unless you call me, then I’ll go.” She called, he went, he 
looked at her only, he begot three sons. 
When they were born, he named them Carl’, Leit’, and Liamor. 
The parrot of the king was their godfather. The king was mar- 
ried. Whenever he sat down to the table to eat, he would say,— 
“One piece in the mouth of Carl’, 
One piece in the mouth of Leit’, 
One piece in the mouth of Liamor. 
Ai Carl’! Ai Leit?! Ai Liamor!”

The queen heard this talk; she said to the parrot,' “Parrot, you 
know all the secrets of the king. Unless you tell me the words 
the king says before he eats, I will kill you.” Parrot answered, 
“The king is calling the names of three boys that a girl called 
Maria had by him.” 
The queen said to him, “To-morrow you go and say to Maria 
that the king has sent you to fetch Carl’ to go to school.” Parrot 
went, he brought Carl’. The queen handed him over to the cook 
to kill him and stew him for the king’s dinner. Carl’ was so 
handsome, that the cook hid him under a chest. In his place she 
killed a little dog, she stewed him, and served him for the dinner 
of the king. When the king said,— 
“One piece in the mouth of Carl’, 
One piece in the mouth of Leit’, 
One piece in the mouth of Liamor, 
Ai Carl’! Ai Leit’! Ai Liamor!” — 
the queen said, “There he is before you.” The next day she 
ordered Parrot to fetch Leit’ to go to school. “You tell her that 
Carl’ already knows more than his teacher.” Parrot brought 
Leit’, the queen gave him to the cook for a stew; but he too was 
so handsome, the cook hid him, she put in his place a little dog. 
When the king said,— 
“One piece in the mouth of Carl’, 
One piece in the mouth of Leit’, 
One piece in the mouth of Liamor, 
Ai Carl’! Ai Leit’! Ai Liamor!” — 
the queen said, “There he is before you.” The next day she sent 
Parrot to get Liamor. “Tell Maria that the other two are already 
past teaching.” This time the cook could not find a dog, she 
stewed a cat.? 
Next day the queen sent Parrot to get Maria. “Tell her to 
come to hear the new mass her three sons are to hold.” When 
Maria came, the queen had a sharp sword on the table ready at 
hand to kill her. The queen asked her, ““Where did you get the

children. They are just like me.” (Fogo.) .

impudence to have children by my husband?” At those words 
the king’s dog ran to where the king was. The dog was trained 
to run to the king when anything happened in the king’s palace. 
The queen repeated, ““Where did you get the impudence to have 
children by my husband? I sent for you to kill you.” The girl 
answered, “I am Maria, daughter of my father, Bianinha; I am 
about to die the death of a chicken without any fault of my own.” 
At this moment the king, led by his dog, arrived. The king 
asked, ‘“‘What are you doing here, Maria?” She answered, 
“This is the fourth day you’ve been sending for us. The first 
day you sent for Carl’, the second day you sent for Leit’, the third 
day you sent for Liamor, and to-day you sent for me.” Then the 
king took the sword which was to kill Maria and cut off the queen’s 
head.. They killed the parrot, they burned him, they put his 
ashes into a bag at the bottom of the stairs for all to wipe their 
feet on. 
When the cook saw all this, she was frightened. She went and 
said to the king, “I know you are going to kill me too, but first 
let me confess my guilt. When the queen gave me the three 
children to kill and stew, I found them so handsome, I did not kill 
them, I killed in their place two dogs and a cat.” The king 
ordered her to bring the children. She brought them. When 
their mother saw them, she fainted. They had to throw water on 
her face to revive her. Then they took the cook out of the 
kitchen, and received her into the house as if she were the chil- 
dren’s mother. They made her the governess of the house. The 
king gave Maria the queen’s crown, and Maria sent for her mother 
to come and live at the palace. They had a great feast. Yes- 
terday afternoon I was passing by; it smelled so good, it gave me 
the desire to goin. There were roast meat, roast turkey, and roast 
chicken, little roast pig with stuffing, and stuffed duck. Besides, 
there were port wine and green wine, red wine and white wine. 
Besides, there was red wine for the servants. 
It is finished. 
95. THE SHOES THAT WERE DANCED TO PIECES.! 
There was a king who had a daughter. The girl wore out seven 
pairs of shoes every night. The king announced that whoever 
was able to find out how she wore out her shoes might marry her

and receive half of his kingdom as well; but if he tried and failed, he 
would have to die. Many made the attempt, but none succeeded. 
In this city lived a woman who had a son. The boy said to his 
mother, “Mother, bake me three loaves of bread. I’m going to 
the king’s house.” She put poison in the bread so that he would 
kill himself before he reached the king’s house, where they would 
kill him. On his way he met a man, who said, ‘Boy, where are 
you going?”—“I’m going to the king to tell him how his daughter 
wears out seven pairs of shoes in one night.”’—‘‘God help you!’ 
said the man, who was San Anton. The boy gave him one of his 
loaves of bread. He went on a little farther, he met an old woman. 
“Boy, where are you going?” —“‘I’m going to the king to tell him 
how his daughter wears out seven pairs of shoes in one night.” — 
“God go with you!” said the woman, who was the Virgin Mary. 
When he gave her a loaf of bread, she gave him a coat that would 
make him invisible. He went on a little farther, he met an old 
man. “Boy, where are you going?”—“I’m going to the king to 
tell him how his daughter wears out seven pairs of shoes in one 
night.”—“‘ You think you can tell him that?”—“‘Oh, yes! I have 
faith in God. He will help me.” The old man, who was God, 
took his last loaf of bread and gave him a whip. 
The king sent him for the night into a room next to the room 
of the princess; but, instead of staying in his room, he put on his 
coat and went into the princess’s room. He watched her wrap 
up six pairs of shoes in a cloth and go out. Then he followed her. 
She went to a flowering bush (jardim' dos flor); she said, “‘Good- 
day, Flowering-Bush!”—“Good-day to you, princess, and good- 
day to your friend!”—‘I am alone,” said the princess, and she 
pulled a flower and fastened it to her coat. The boy pulled one 
too, and fastened it also to his coat. She went on, she came to 
a silver-bush (jardim dos prata). “‘Good-day, Silver-Bush!”— 
“‘Good-day to you, princess, and good-day to your friend!” —‘‘I 
am alone,” and she pulled off a silver flower and fastened it to 
her coat. The boy did likewise. She went on, she came to a 
copper-bush (jardim dos cobre). “Good-day, Copper-Bush!”— 
“Good-day to you, princess, and good-day to your friend!”— 
“T am alone,” and she pulled off a copper flower and fastened 
it to her coat. The boy did likewise. 
They went on, they passed by a white horse. The princess

as well.

jumped on the horse; but the boy cracked his whip, he reached 
the destination of the princess before her. There was a company 
of old men with long whiskers and bald heads, and the hall they 
danced in was as long as from Trinidad to Cutelo Comprido 
(from Newport to Fall River). Every time the princess danced 
the length of it, she threw aside a pair of shoes. The boy picked 
them up. Her last dance she danced in the seventh pair. Then 
the boy cracked his whip over the head of the old man who was 
dancing with her, and he disappeared. 
The princess started for home. The boy went ahead of her, he 
lay down in his bed and went to sleep. - When she arrived, she 
looked at him; she said, “Ah! this is the man who is going to tell 
my father on me, and here he is asleep.” In the morning she 
wakened him, she made light of him, she sent him to her father. 
The king asked, “Have you learned how the princess wears out 
the seven pairs of shoes in one night?”—“‘Yes, and I’m going to 
tell you. When she leaves the house, she first goes to a flowering 
bush,” and he showed the king the flower he pulled. ‘Then she 
goes to a silver-bush,” and he showed the king the silver flower. 
“Then she goes to a copper-bush,” and he showed the king the 
copper flower. ‘“‘Then she meets a white horse, and the horse 
carries her across the river. There is a company of old men in a 
great dance-hall. Each time the princess dances the length of 
the hall, she throws aside a pair of shoes. Here are the six pair, 
the seventh she has on.” : 
The king asked the boy if he wanted to marry the princess. “I 
don’t want your daughter,” answered the boy, “but give me half of 
your kingdom.” With his fortune he returned to his mother and 
built her a three-storied house. His mother blessed him; she 
said, “In return for the fortune you have brought me, may you 
live as long as Methuselah!”

TO PIECES, 
There was a boy named Manuel White-Cap. He liked. to 
ramble about. One day he was out walking, he met three boys

fighting over an overcoat. He said, “Three men fighting over 
one coat!” They answered, “We have reason to fight over this 
coat. It is the only thing our father left us. We have to divide 
it.”—‘‘Of what value is it?” —‘‘ Whoever puts it on can go any- 
where without anyone seeing him.” Manuel said, “Tl divide it 
for you.” In his pocket he had three oranges. He took one out, 
he threw it down the hill. He said to them, ‘Whoever gets the 
orange will get the coat.” While they were running after the 
orange, he picked up the overcoat, he left. 
He went, went. He met two boys fighting over a silk hat. He 
said to them, ““Two men fighting over a hat!” They answered, 
“We have good reason to fight over it. It is the only thing that 
our father left us. We have to divide it.”—‘‘Of what value is it?”’ 
—Whoever puts it on can pass over water without getting wet.” 
— “Tl divide it for you.” He took out another orange, he threw 
it. .While he said to them, ‘‘Who gets it will get the hat,” and 
they were running after it, he picked up the hat for himself, he left. 
He went to a city named White-Sands-Yellow-Water. Here 
lived a princess who used to wear out six pairs of shoes in one 
night. The king announced that any boy of eighteen able to tell 
him how she wore out six pairs of shoes in one night might marry 
her and inherit half of the kingdom. Manuel arrived at the king’s 
house. He asked if that announcement was true. “Yes, it is 
true as they say; and who fails to find out will lose his head. 
You will have to pass the night in her room.”——“‘Good!”” Manuel 
said. “‘Princess, you must go to bed with no curtains around 
you,'so I can see you.” The princess said to him, “‘All right! 
Xow are the little lamb I want.” 
At midnight the princess looked at.Manuel, who covered his 
head with the sheet. “Ah! my little lamb, I’m going to do for 
you.” Then to the door, ‘‘O young devil! open the door for me.” 
Manuel got up; he said to his hat, “Hat, take me after the prin- 
cess.” The princess came to a river. She said, “O young devil! 
pass me over this river.”—‘‘My hat, pass me over this river.” 
She came to asilver-bush. She said, “‘Good-night, Silver-Bush!” 
—“Good-night, Lady Princess! [Good-night to you] and your 
companion!”—‘‘But I haveno companion!” Shecame to a gold- 
bush. She said, ‘‘Good-night, Gold-Bush!”—‘‘Good-night, Lady 
Princess! [Good-night to you] and your companion!”—“But 
Ihave no companion!” She came to a diamond-bush. She said, 
“Good-night, Diamond-Bush!”—“Good-night, Lady Princess!
-P-A-G-E-322
Folk-Lore from the Cape Verde Islands. 295 
[Good-night to you] and your companion!”—‘‘But I have no 
companion!” 
By one o’clock they were in a palace where there was a big 
dance. There were forty men there, and she the only woman. 
Manuel said, “My hat, put me in a corner.”’ The first dance 
was a waltz. When she danced it through, the soles of her shoes 
were worn off. She took them off, she put them aside. Manuel 
picked them up, he tucked them under his coat. The second 
dance was a mazurka. When she finished dancing it, the soles of 
her second pair of shoes were worn out. She took them off, she 
put them aside. Manuel picked them up, he tucked them under 
his coat. The third dance was a schottische; the fourth, a 
strombolica; the fifth and sixth, a contra-dance. After each 
dance she threw aside one pair of shoes. Manuel took them 
all. While she was talking to the major-domo, Manuel gave 
the man a biff in the face with his hat. The major-domo 
said to her, “To-night you are here with a companion.” The 
princess said, “I have no companion.”—‘Well, when you leave 
to-night, never return. ’ll have nothing more to do with you.” 
On her return she passed by the diamond-bush. She said, “‘Good- 
by, Diamond-Bush!”—“Good-by, Lady Princess! Good-by to 
you and your companion!” Manuel broke off a flower, he put it 
inhis coat. She came tothe gold-bush. “Good-by, Gold-Bush!” 
—“Good-by, Lady Princess! Good-by to you and your com- 
panion!” Manuel broke off a golden flower, he put it in his coat. 
She came to the silver-bush. ‘‘Good-by, Silver-Bush!”—‘‘ Good- 
by, Lady Princess! Good-by to you and your companion!” 
Manuel broke off a silver flower, he put it in his coat: At the 
river she said, “‘O young devil! pass me over this river.” Manuel 
said, “O my hat! pass me over this river, and take me to the 
king’s house.”” He arrived before the princess arrived. He took 
off his clothes, he lay down. When she arrived, she looked at him; 
she said, “You do well for my little lamb.” 
In the morning Manuel did not arrive on time. The king sent 
a soldier to get him. The soldier said to him, “Didn’t you see 
the notice to present yourself punctually at nine o’clock?”” Man- 
uel said, “I wasn’t worrying.’ —“I have caught the rat in a trap.” 
‘The princess was sitting in her fine clothes by the side of the king. 
The king asked the boy, “‘Do you know how the princess wears 
out the six pairs of shoes in one night?”—‘‘Yes, Sir King. At 
midnight she calls on the young devil to open the door for her.
-P-A-G-E-323

Then she walks to a river. She calls again on the young devil 
to pass her across the river. She comes to a silver-bush.” 
Manuel pulled out a flower. “Here is one of its flowers.” He 
handed it to the king. ‘‘She comes to a gold-bush. Here is one 
of its flowers. She comes to a diamond-bush. Here are its 
flowers.” When he said this, the princess changed color. “When 
she arrives at the house of the young devils, she calls to them to 
open the door. Inside, her first dance is a waltz. Here are the 
shoes she danced it in. The second dance is a mazurka. Here 
are the shoes she danced it in. The third dance is a schottische. 
Here are the shoes. The fourth, fifth, and sixth dances are a 
strombolica and contra-dances. Here are the fourth, fifth, and 
sixth pairs of shoes. But as for marrying the princess, I marry 
no woman who dances with young devils.” With these words 
he stood up, he shook hands with all present, he bade them 
good-by. 
97. THE ENVIOUS SISTERS.! 
There were three sisters who lived out in the country. Their 
father and mother were dead; they were poor, and they sewed for 
a living. One Sunday they were sitting on the verandah; the 
eldest sister, who was troubled by their poverty, said, “I wish I 
were the bride to-day of the king’s cook!”” The second sister said, 
“TI wish I were the bride to-day of the king’s servant!” The 
youngest said, “I wish I were the bride to-day of the king him- 
self!”2 The huntsman of the king was passing by, he heard them

talking. When he returned, he said to the king, “To-day out in the 
country I saw three pretty girls. The first said, ‘I wish I were the 
bride to-day of the king’s cook!’ The second sister said, ‘I wish I 
were the bride to-day of the king’s servant!’ The youngest said, 
“I wish I were the bride to-day of the king himself!’” The king 
said to him, “To-morrow go for those girls for me.” When the 
girls arrived, the king had the table set for them. After they 
finished eating, the king asked about their conversation. The 
eldest sister said to him, “It is true, I said I wished I were the 
bride to-day of the king’s cook.” The second sister said, “I wish 
I were the bride to-day of the king’s servant.” The youngest 
said, “I wish I were the bride to-day of the king himself.” Eight 
days afterwards the king married one of the eldest two girls to his 
cook, and the other to his servant, and eight days later the king 
married the youngest.! 
The youngest became queen; her sisters, her servants. Because 
of this they were not content. When the queen was about to 
have a child, the king told her sisters to fetch the midwife. The 
sisters said to him, “She is our sister, this is woman’s work, we 
will take care of her ourselves.” ? The queen gave birth to a boy 
with a gold star on his head. ‘The eldest sister said to the second 
sister, “Put the child in a bowl and throw it into the river. I will 
put a cat with that demon.” Then they called the king, they 
showed him the cat, they told him his wife had borne a cat. 
They killed the cat. Within two or three months the queen be- 
came pregnant again. Nine months later the day came when 
she was about to have a child. The king told the sisters to fetch 
the midwife, but they told him they themselves would take care 
of her. The queen gave birth to another boy with a gold star on 
his head. The eldest sister said, “Throw the child into the river. 
I will put a rat with that demon.” They showed the king the 
rat? The king was disgusted, he sent and had the rat killed. 
Within two or three months the queen appeared pregnant again.

have children with gold stars, and for her to have a child like the child of any poor person. 
She threatens to kill herself unless the king has the servant buried in the courtyard. 
(San Anton.)

put a dog with that demon.” When they showed the dog to the 
king, he sent and had it killed. He said he would have nothing 
more to do with a woman who gave birth to animals! He gave 
orders to have her buried in the courtyard, to give her a cup of 
water and a piece of bread. 
We leave her, we will follow the three children. There was a 
man who worked in a garden near the river. He saw each of the 
children as it floated by. He hooked the bowl, he pulled it 
ashore He took each one, he carried it to his wife. His wife 
had no children, she was very glad to bring up the children. They 
took the man and his wife for their father and mother. He 
taught the boys to hunt, the girl he taught women’s housework. 
After nineteen years the man died; six months later his wife died 
too Then the girl kept house for her brothers, who went out 
hunting. 
One day an old woman came to the house.t. She asked the girl 
if she had a mother. ‘‘No, she died some time ago.”—~“‘Do you 
want company?”—“Yes, lady.”—‘‘When your brothers come 
home, ask them if they would like me to stay with you. I am 
looking for a place to live.’ The brothers were glad for their 
sister to have a companion. . They made up a bed for the old 
woman. Next day she asked them if they met any of the royal 
family. They said, “No.”-——“Don’t you salute any one?” 
They said, “No.”— “Good! I am going to give you a ribbon to 
tie across your forehead where you have a mark. Do not raise 
your hat to any one, even the king. I beg you to take my advice.”’ 
Next day they went hunting. They heard a shot, they went in

they suggest to the king that it is perhaps some sickness in her that causes the strange 
births. (San Vicente.)

children quarrel, and the former tell the latter they are not their real relations. Then the 
twins — the boy with a gold star on his forehead, the girl with a gold apple in her hand — 
set out to find their parents. (Fogo.) 
4 Variants: (a) After the girl has shown her over the house the foster-father has built for 
them as a remembrance, the old woman says three things are lacking,— the Singing Tree, 
the Talking Bird, and the Water of Gold. To satisfy the girl’s desire for these things, 
the brothers set forth on their quest. (San Vicente.)

that the palace the twins have taken possession of will be the “mais said’ de mund’,a

its direction. They encountered the king and his vassals. The 
king asked them, “Are you accustomed to shoot here?” — Yes, 
sir!’—“Do you not know to whom you are speaking, that you 
do not raise your hat?”—“‘Sir, we raise our hats to nobody.” 
The king invited them to come to dine with him. When they 
reached home, they told the old woman that the king had invited 
them to come to dinner with him in his house The old woman 
said, “It is sad that you have not the proper clothes to wear to 
dinner.”—‘‘ Well, we shall go in those we have on.” ‘The old 
woman told the girl to get ready a large basket, for them to go 
to a big store. They went; the old woman bought two outfits,— 
two watches, two umbrellas, two hats, two pairs of shoes, two of 
everything proper for youths of nineteen, besides two ribbons. 
Next day the old woman bathed them, cut their finger-nails, 
dressed them in their new clothes. “To-day you are going to 
dine with the king, be careful not to remove your ribbons. The 
king will have you sit next to him. Do not drink or eat any- 
thing that they set before you, except what you see the king eat 
and drink. Becareful!’”’ They went to the palace, where every 
one said how much they looked like the king. After they ate, 
the king invited them to go out into the garden. On the last 
step they saw the woman buried in the courtyard. The eldest 
. boy asked the king, “Sir, who is this woman?” The king an- 
swered, “Don’t let us look at her!” As the king spoke, milk 
streamed from the breasts of the woman into their mouths. The 
woman began to weep. The boys kept thinking of her. They 
said to the king, ““We should like you to come to our house to 
dinner too, if you will bring that woman with you.” The king 
answered them, “I will come to your house, but I will not take 
that woman.” 
When they went home, they told the old woman that they had 
invited the king and his vassals to dinner in eight days. They 
told the old woman about the woman buried in the courtyard, 
and how milk from the breasts of the woman had streamed into 
their mouths. The old woman said to them, “The king will not 
come to dine with us in a house like ours.” They said to her,

like to have things here finer than the king’s?”—‘‘ Yes.” —““Then 
you must bring here the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree, and the 
Yellow Water.” The eldest boy started forth! When he had 
gone three miles, he met Don Debro. He asked him, “Eh, boy! 
where are you going?” —‘I am going after the Talking Bird, the 
Singing Tree, and the Yellow Water.”” Don Debro said to him, 
“Who goes that way never comes back.” 2 The boy said to him, 
“T have to go,” and he went. After he had gone quite a distance, 
he heard a voice behind him say to him, “Eh, you fool! where are 
you going?” He turned, he looked back, he and his horse turned 
into stone. 
The next day, when he did not come back, his youngest brother 
said, ““I am going after him.” He too met Don Debro, he too 
turned into stone. When they did not come, their sister said to 
the old woman, “I am going after them.” The old woman said 
to her, ‘‘Mount the black horse you will find at the door, and 
take with you an iron cage and this pair of scissors. When you 
meet Don Debro, clean him up, he will show you the road to an 
old woman, who will direct you further.” When she went, she 
met Don Debro. He said to her, “Eh, girl! where are you going?” 
—“After the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree, and the Yellow 
Water.”’—“ Who goes that way never comes back.”-——“I have to 
go. If I dismount and clean you, will you show me the road?” — 
“Oh, yes, child! You are the first creature to do good to me.” 
Then she dismounted, she took and cleaned his face with her 
handkerchief, with her scissors she cut his hair. ‘‘Here is a ball 
of twine, go to that little hill, throw the ball; where it rolls, at the 
end, you will meet an old woman to put you on your road.” The 
girl went to the hill, she threw the ball, the ball unrolled, she went 
to the end, she met an old woman. It was the same old woman 
who lived with her. “Little grand-daughter, where are you 
going?” —“After the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree, and the 
Yellow Water.” The old woman said to her, “‘Many souls who 
pass here never return. Two days ago two boys passed here, they 
have not yet returned.” The girl said, ‘They were my two 
brothers.” The old woman was carding cotton. “I am going to 
stop up your ears with this cotton, but first listen to what I shall 
tell you. Where you go, you will hear much noise, and they will

call you all kinds of names; but do not listen, and do not look 
back. The bird you are seeking will be in the tree that sings. 
Near it is the tank of yellow water. You will open the cage and 
say, ‘Come here, bird!’ Put this jug I give you in the tank. 
One drop of water will fill the jug to the brim. Pull a branch 
off the tree, fasten it to your horse in front. The gate will open at 
twelve, it will shut at half-past twelve. It will shut on the tail of 
your horse. You will cut the tail with these scissors. Then run, 
run, run, to get away from the noises. Dismount; on every stone 
you see, and every blade of grass, put a drop of water. When 
you reach here, I will take the cotton out of your ears, you will 
see what was following you.”” As the old woman had said to her, 
the voices called out, ‘Oh, you crazy one! You are crazy, you 
are virtuous, none can enchant you!”” But the girl did everything 
the old woman told her to do. She did not look back, she came 
to the old woman, the old woman took the cotton from her ears. 
“Look back now! See all the souls you have disenchanted with a 
drop of water!” The first she saw were her two brothers running 
towards her! The old woman said to her, “God go with you!” 
When they reached home, they could not find their house, but 
they saw the old woman sitting in the window of a grand house. 
The old woman said to them, “After you left me here alone, I 
went down on my knees, I asked for this house, it appeared like a 
miracle. The garden is all ready, too.” They put the Yellow 
Water into the tank, it filled it up to the brim. They threw down 
the branch, up sprang a tree. They opened the cage, the bird flew 
out and alighted on the tree. The tree began to talk. They all 
marvelled. 
The next day was the day for the king and his vassals to come 
to dinner. Everything was prepared, the table set, men-servants 
and women-servants were ready. The king and his vassals came. 
After dinner they invited the king to walk into their garden. The 
first thing they showed him was the tank of yellow water. He 
said, “What a wonder! How the water flows up to the brim 
without overflowing! What a wonder!” The bird answered,

and said, “‘I knew you were a great man.” The king asked, “Who 
is speaking?” The Talking Bird said to him, ‘‘O fool!” The 
king said, “I am going from here. This place is enchanted.” 
The Talking Bird said to him, “Sit down, you are a fool. Mar- 
vellous, marvellous! It is no more marvellous than a woman 
giving birth to a cat! That boy there is your eldest son.”—‘O 
Jesus!””—‘‘It is no more marvellous than a woman giving birth to 
arat. That boy there is your second son.”—“O Jesus!”—“It 
is no more marvellous than a woman giving birth to a dog. That 
girl there is your daughter. The woman buried in your court- 
yard is the mother of these three children. Her two sisters are 
they who did it.” Then the king had the woman brought 
and cleansed. The two sisters he had burned to ashes, which he 
put in the entrance for their sister, whenever she stepped out, to 
step on.2 The old woman bade them good-by, she disappeared. 
Thereafter the children lived with their father and mother.*

[Two sisters, Marta and Martinha, lived together. Marta 
married a prince; Martinha was her midwife (parteira), and 
Martinha took the child when it was born and threw it into the 
sea. In its place she put adog,a cat,and a pig. The-Old-Woman- 
of-the-Sea took the children and brought them up.] 
They grew up, they played on the beach every Sunday. One 
Sunday they brought with them to the well three little wooden 
horses.6 They said, “Little wooden horses, drink water!”® A

next Sunday The-Old-Woman-of-the-Sea told them not to eat any- 
thing that was given to them. When they came, the servant 
gave them the poisoned cakes their mother’s sister sent them. 
The eldest two refused them; but the youngest took [a cake], he 
ate it, he died. The others ran to tell the old woman. She 
brought ointment, she rubbed him with it, she restored him to life. 
Another Sunday they came again to the well. They said to their 
little horses, “Little wooden horses, drink water!” The servant 
asked them, “How can a wooden horse drink water?”—‘“A little 
wooden horse drinks water just as a woman at delivery would give 
birth to a dog, a cat, and a little pig.1 So my little wooden horse 
drinks water.” The servant went home; she told the king that 
she met three children at the well saying, “Little wooden horses, 
drink water!” [She said,] “I asked them how a little wooden horse 
could drink water. They answered, ‘Just as a woman at delivery 
would give birth to a cat, a dog, and a little pig. So my little 
wooden horse drinks water.’” 
The king went into the country to see the children. He invited 
them to his house to pass the day. They said to him, “We can- 
not go until we see our mother.” The-Old-Woman-of-the-Sea 
said to them, “When you sit at the prince’s table, each of you take 
a piece of bread and a cup of wine and carry them to the woman 
who is buried under the verandah, where the dish-water falls on 
her, She is your mother. When you start to take that to her, 
her sister will say not to give it to her, it will make her burst. Do 
you answer her, ‘She will not be able to burst with three pieces of 
bread and three cups of wine, as she did not burst with us three 
in her belly for nine months.’” The children did as The-Old- 
Woman-of-the-Sea told them? The king asked them to repeat 
what they said. They said, “She will not be able to burst with 
three pieces of bread and three cups of wine, as she did not burst 
with us in her belly for nine months.” The king asked, “Is that

told you so?” — The-Old-Woman-of-the-Sea, who brought us up. 
She says that when she gave birth to us, her sister threw us into 
the sea, and in our place put a little dog, a little cat, and a little 
pig.” Then the king sent for The-Old-Woman-of-the-Sea. He 
made her mistress of the house. The woman buried under the 
verandah he [had] washed and clothed in wedding-garments.! 
Her sister he sent to the gallows.?

and yet it bears neither fruit nor blossoms. Why is that?” 
She went, went, went, she passed by a house full of girls. “Old 
Lady, where are you going?” —‘‘I am going to Lady Mother-of- 
the-Sun.”—‘‘Tell her you passed by a house full of girls who 
neither marry nor bear children. Why is that?” She went, 
went, went, she came to the house of Lady Mother-of-the-Sun. 
Lady Mother-of-the-Sun slapped her, she turned into a stool 
[trupas],° on which Mother-of-the-Sun sat down. ‘Lady Mother- 
of-the-Sun, I have something to ask you. On my way I passed 
by a lake. It was big and clear, and yet it contained neither 
dondon nor tainha. Why was that?”—‘Because it has never 
swallowed a person.”’—‘‘Lady Mother-of-the-Sun, on my way I

passed by an orange-tree. It was large and green, and yet it 
bore neither fruit nor blossoms. Why was that?”—“ Because 
it has a gold brick at its roots.”—“Lady Mother-of-the-Sun, on 
my way I passed by a house full of girls who neither marry nor 
bear children. Why is that?”—‘Because of the refuse they 
throw before the door each day as they come and go.”—“‘Lady 
Mother-of-the-Sun, what is there that will revive three dead 
children?” —“The spittle we make in the first mouthful of food 
we give to our little cat.” Then Mother-of-the-Sun slapped the 
stool, and she turned back into a person. She left, and on her 
return she reached the house full of girls. “Old Lady, Old Lady, 
Old Lady, what did Mother-of-the-Sun say?”—‘‘She said it was 
the refuse you threw before the door every day as you went and 
came. I found that out for you, I found that out for you!” and 
Old Lady hurried on. Immediately the girls were possessed of 
sons and grandsons and great-grandsons. Old Lady went, went, 
went, she reached the orange-tree. ‘“‘Old Lady, Old Lady, Old 
Lady, what did Mother-of-the-Sun say?”—‘“She said it was the 
gold brick at your roots. I found it out for you, I found it out for 
you!” and Old Lady hurried on. Immediately the orange-tree 
was covered with oranges, and oranges dropped from it to the 
ground. Old Lady went, went, went, she reached the lake. “Old 
Lady, Old Lady, Old Lady, what did Mother-of-the-Sun say?” 
Old Lady pretended not to hear, she hurried on, until she looked 
back, she saw between her and the lake a man.!_ “‘She said it was 
because you had never swallowed a person. I found it out for 
you, I found it out for you!” Immediately Lake swallowed up 
the man.

There was a woman had an only son. The woman loved the 
boy so much, that she let him do whatever he wanted. Ina book 
he was reading he saw the picture of a girl, the most beautiful girl 
there was in the world. He asked his mother for money to go and 
look for her. His mother gave him the money. He started. He 
went, went, went. He came to the house of an old woman, the 
mother of the pretty girl, He asked the old woman about the

girl he was looking for. The old woman said to him, ‘“‘She comes 
every morning to take a bath at a certain place.’ He said, “To- 
morrow morning, when she comes, let me know.” Next morning 
he waited, waited, the old woman did not let him know. He 
said, “I’m going there, at any rate.” The old woman said to 
him, “Don’t go!” He answered, “I am going.” The old woman 
said to him, “Before you go, take some coffee and bread.” The 
old woman put a soporific into the bread. He ate and went. 
When the girl came, she found him asleep. The girl wept. She 
wet a handkerchief, she put it on his breast. She told the old 
woman to tell him that there were only two more mornings for 
her to come, after that he would not see her. When he awoke, he 
asked the old woman if the girl came there. The old woman 
answered, “‘Yes, she came. She [tried to] waken you, you did not 
waken. She told me to tell you that she had only two more 
mornings to come in, after that you would not see her again.” 
He said, ‘“‘If I don’t see her, I will kill myself. To-morrow I will 
not sleep. I must stay awake to see her.” Next day he made 
ready to go. The old woman said, “Don’t go until you drink 
coffee and [eat] bread!” Again the old woman put a soporific in 
the bread. When the girl came, she turned him, she shook him, 
she could not wake him up. On his breast she left a ring with her 
name on it. The girl said to the old woman, “Tell him to keep 
this ring. He has only one more time to see me. If he does not 
see me this time, he will never see me.” Next morning he started 
to go. The old woman said, “Don’t go until you drink coffee and 
[eat] bread!”” In the bread she put a soporific. When the girl 
came, she found him. asleep. She wept until she wept blood. 
She wet a handkerchief, she put it on his breast. She said to the 
old woman, “Tell him that he will never again see me until we 
meet in another world.” He awoke; he said to the old woman, 
“T am going to kill myself.” The old woman said to him, “Why 
will you kill yourself? I have a daughter as beautiful as that girl. 
I will marry her to you.”—‘‘No, I do not want her.” 
He started forth, he paid no attention to where he was going. 
He came to the house of Mother-of-the-Winds. He asked 
Mother-of-the-Winds, “Can you not tell me where Constantina 
lives?”-—“‘No, I go the whole world through, I have never heard 
where she lives.” He bowed his head. He went, went, went. 
He came to the house of Mother-of-the-Sun. He asked Mother- 
of-the-Sun, “Can you not tell me where Constantina lives?” —

“No, I shine the whole world through, I have never heard where 
she lives.” He bowed his head. He went, went, went. He 
came to the house of Mother-of-the-Moon. He asked Mother- 
of-the-Moon, “Can you not tell me where Constantina lives?”"— 
“No, I shine the whole world through, I have never heard where 
she lives.” He sent word to his mother to let his dove fly, as he 
was in distress. When his dove came, he wrote a note, he tied it 
under its wings. He said, ‘‘My dove, fly all over the world until 
you see Constantina. When you see her, give her this note.” 
The dove flew and flew until it found Constantina. It gave her 
the note. Constantina read, and answered, “You cannot reach 
the place where I am except by flying. There are too many 
dangerous animals you have to pass by.” After he received this 
note, he set forth to the house of Mother-of-Falcons. He asked 
her if she could not put him where Constantina was within three 
days. Mother-of Falcons said to him, “Yes, I will put you there, 
but it will cost you dear.”—‘‘How much will it cost me?”—“It 
will cost you sixty cows for me to eat on the way.” He bought 
sixty cows, he killed them, he hung the meat on Falcon. They 
started forth. They went until they almost reached there. Fal- 
con said to him, “We must stop here, because the meat is all gone; 
but if you wish to see how long you would last if I let you go here, 
watch this piece of meat.” She dropped a piece of meat. Ser- 
pents fell on it, and all kinds of fierce animals. He said to Falcon, 
“Take one of my legs and eat it.”” They flew a little farther. 
Mother-of-Falcons said to him, “I am hungry, I must eat.” He 
said to her, “Take the other leg.” They flew a little farther. 
Mother-of-Falcons said to him, “I am hungry, I must eat.”— 
“Take a piece of my right buttocks.’ They flew a little farther. 
Mother-of-Falcons said to him. “I am hungry, I must eat.”— 
“Take my left breast. If you drop me, all I ask is that you drop 
me at the door of a doctor.” She dropped him at the door of a 
doctor. He cured him, he recovered. 
It was the last day of publishing Constantina’s wedding. 
They were celebrating it with the game of catching rings They 
1 “Competition for little rings.” It is a ring-spearing sport. The regular ring is of 
iron, but special rings (grenaido) covered with ribbons are made by brothers and sisters 
and sweethearts. The iron ring hangs from a cross wire or cord between two poles through 
which the horseman rides, From the ring projects a short piece of iron which fits into a 
piece of cari¢’, The other end of the carig’ is pierced, and through the hole runs the 
transverse wire or cord. The larger grenaldo are merely tied to the cross wire or cord. 
The spear is of wood, about six feet long. The horseman has three chances to spear the ring. If he fail, the ring is appropriated by the manager of the sport. The sport is en-

gave him an old pig to ride on to get the rings. They jeered at 
him and his pig. The others had fine horses. He took out his 
strike-a-light; he said, “From strike-a-light a horse, from strike-a- 
light a suit of clothes the color of the moon.” He rode on the 
horse, he raced, he caught the rings. He raced, he passed by the 
king’s house. He threw the first handkerchief Constantina gave 
him into her lap. Constantina said, “Oh, if I could see the hand 
that threw this handkerchief!” He said again to his strike-a- 
light, “‘From strike-a-light a suit of clothes the color of the sun.” 
He ran his horse, he passed by the king’s house. He threw the 
second handkerchief. It fell into Constantina’s lap. A third 
time he ran his horse. He threw the ring. It fell on Constan- 
tina’s finger. The king said, ‘‘What impudence, this racing 
through the streets!’ The princess arose; she said to the king, 
“Father, if you lost a key and had made a new key and then 
found the old key, which of them would you use?” The king 
answered, ‘“‘The old key.” Constantina said to him, ‘“‘Then this 
is my husband.” Then they took the man whom Constantina 
was going to marry, put him in a tar barrel, set it on fire. 
100. THE RACE. 
Ii 
There was a bet between Porpoise and Scollop. “I’m the 
fastest fish in the sea,” said Porpoise. Two scollops combined 
together, planning that one should take a position at the start of 
gaged in on three saints’ days, and only on those days,— St. John’s (June 24), St. Peter’s 
(June 29), St. Sebastian’s (Jan. 20). On St. John’s Day there is an accompanying feast. 
The horsemen carry the silk standard of the saint (4ande’ra) on which his picture is em- 
broidered. Before the contest the standard is furled and laid across a table near which 
sit all the notabilities. When a horseman gets the iron ring, he places it in his cap and 
takes it to the table. There he drops the ring from his cap into the cap of the priest or 
some other person of authority, who in turn gives the ring to the manager to replace. Only 
one iron ring is in use. At the conclusion of the contest the horsemen dismount, and, 
forming two by two in a column, carry the standard to the church. In this procession the 
standard is carried “like a casket,” and each bearer must have his hand onit. If there is a 
large number of bearers, there may be as many as twenty-four ribbons attached to the 
standard for some of the bearers to hold. Whoever volunteers to give the feast the follow- 
ing year raises up the standard at the church and takes it to his house to keep during the 
year. If more than one volunteer, the captain of the horsemen decides. If the standard 
is left “buried” (interrad’) in church, it will be a dry, poor year. I was told of the occur- 
rence of one such year. Sometimes two or three days will elapse before any one volunteers. 
During that time people may be heard talking about how the dande’ra di San Jon has been 
Jefe buried.

was there ahead of him. Porpoise wondered how Scollop could 
beat him, since he was the fastest fish in the sea.

Turtle and Goat-Gazelle had a bet. They were to run a race 
of twenty miles, the winner to get one of the young of the other. 
Goat-Gazelle started on land; Turtle, in the water. Every five 
miles it was agreed that each should call out so that the other 
would know where he was. When they had gone five miles, 
Turtle called out to Goat-Gazelle, “You stole my mother’s 
shoes!” Goat-Gazelle called back, “I didn’t steal your mothet’s 
shoes, but you stole my father’s shoes!” Turtle was half a mile 
ahead. When they had gone ten miles, Turtle called out, “You.

steal your mother’s shoes, but you stole my father’s shoes!” 
Turtle was one mile ahead. When they had gone fifteen miles, 
Turtle called out, “You stole my mother’s shoes!”—“I didn’t 
steal your mother’s shoes, but you stole my father’s shoes!” 
Turtle was a mile and a half ahead. Goat-Gazelle said, “I know 
you're ahead of me now. I’m tired, but I’m going to get there 
ahead of you.”—‘That’s impossible,” said Turtle. Turtle 
reached the twenty-mile limit, and was in the house when Goat- 
Gazelle arrived. ‘‘You stole my mother’s shoes!” said Turtle. 
Goat-Gazelle answered, ‘““You beat me, because I broke my leg 
on the way.”—‘That is a poor excuse,” said Turtle. “When 
you broke your leg, you should have told me, not waited until you 
reached the goal.” Goat-Gazelle refused to pay the bet. That 
is the reason Goat-Gazelle lives in the woods, and that Turtle 
lives in the sea and comes to the shore to lay her eggs, and thirty 
days later returns to the shore to take out her little ones. She is 
afraid Goat-Gazelle will get her little ones.

IOI, THE BIRDS TAKE BACK THEIR FEATHERS: THE THREAT 
MIDWAY: PLAYING DEAD. 
There were a wolf and a nephew. There was a dance on an 
island. Nephew fooled Wolf; he told him how it was a feast, 
not a dance. Wolf asked the birds to lend him feathers, so that 
he might go to the feast on the island. The birds gave him 
feathers, he went to the island, at nine o’clock the dance began. 
Wolf was in a temper because it was a dance, not a feast. Wolf 
asked Nephew if there was nothing to eat. Nephew answered, 
“No, this isn’t a feast, it’s a dance.” ? 
The first to dance was Crow. Wolf, in a passion, began to 
sing,>— 
“Black crow! 
You think you are somebody! 
If you were not always digging up people’s corn in the 
furrow, 
You would be fine.” 
Crow took from him his feather. 
Next to dance was Vulture.t Wolf sang out,— 
“Vulture! 
You think you are somebody! 
If you were not always on the lookout 
for dead donkeys and goats to eat, 
You would be fine.” 
Vulture took from him his feather. 
Next to dance was Bluejay. Wolf sang out,— 
“Bluejay! 
You think you are somebody!

2 It is customary, however, to serve caniha (a stew of hominy and rice and chicken) 
before midnight at a dance, and black coffee at 4 a.M. A dance may begin at any hour, 
even in the morning, and it may last two or three days. 
3 Although my informants did not sing, they said that it was usual to sing Wolf’s 
insults to the birds.

Wood,” appears to be the Island soubriquet for “vulture.”

You don’t see that red mouth of yours; 
But for your mouth, 
You would be fine.” 
Bluejay took from him his feather. 
Next to dance was Chinchirote. Wolf sang out,— 
“And you, Chinchirote! 
You think you are somebody! 
You do not look at your big belly and your 
lean legs; 
If it were not for that, 
You would be fine.” 
Chinchirote took from him his feather. 
Next to dance was Hawk. Wolf sang,— 
“And you, Hawk! 
You think you are somebody! 
If you were not always after people’s chickens, 
- You would be fine.” 
Hawk took from him the feather he had given him. 
Next to dance was Guinea-Hen. Wolf sang out,— 
“You, Guinea-Hen! 
You think you are somebody! 
But you don’t see your own measly head; 
But for your head, 
You would be fine.” 
Guinea-Hen took from him his feather. 
At six in the morning the dance was over, everybody went 
home, they left Wolf alone on the island. Wolf began to cry. 
Just then there came Aunt Fish-Horse. She asked Wolf, ““What’s 
the matter with you?” Wolf said to her, “The birds loaned me 
their feathers, I went to the dance, at daybreak they took their 
feathers, they went, they left me alone there.” Fish-Horse said 
to him, “If you were not bad, I'd carry you across.”—“If you 
take me to my country, I’ll pay you well,” promised Wolf. “Well, 
jump on my back!” The fish began to swim across. Midway 
Wolf said, “Oh, what big breasts! When I get ashore, I’m going 
to pull one of them off.”—‘‘What’s that you say?” asked Fish- 
Horse. “Nothing, I said you were a swimmer.” As soon as 
they made land, Wolf jumped ashore, he tore off the left breast 
of Fish-Horse.
-P-A-G-E-339
312 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society. 
Fish-Horse lay crying on the beach. Nephew passed by, he 
asked her why she was crying. Fish-Horse said to Nephew, “I 
brought Wolf across from that island; as soon as we landed, he 
tore off my breast.”——“‘If you pay me something, I’ll put Uncle 
Wolf into your hands,” said Nephew. Aunt Fish-Horse said to 
him, “If you put Wolf into my hands, I'll give you whatever you 
ask me.” 
Nephew started for home. As he neared the house, he called 
out loud to his wife, “Get a knife, a machad’,a bowl! We are 
going down to the sea to kill a cow lying there.” Wolf was close 
by, he heard; he said, “Nephew, that cow is mine, it is not yours, 
I left her there. If you put a hand on her, I will put a shot into 
you.” Then Wolf said to his wife, “Get my knife, machad’, bowl! 
We are going to the beach.” He reached the beach, he went on 
top of Fish-Horse to kill her. Fish-Horse grabbed him by the 
leg, she dragged him into the sea. Wolf’s wife began to scream. 
Wolf called to her, “Wife, don’t cry! She is just playing with me, 
she is not going to do anything to me.” Fish-Horse dived down 
with him. As they came up, Wolf saw his wife still crying. He 
said to her, “Don’t cry! She is just playing with me. If she 
goes to the bottom and doesn’t come up, cry then.” Fish-Horse 
dived, and deeper. Wolf was almost choked. He called to his 
wife; he said, “Cry, this is the time to cry, this isn’t play.” Fish- 
Horse wanted to settle him. She dived to the bottom with him. 
Just here was the end of Sir Wolf. 
102. THE BIRDS TAKE BACK THEIR FEATHERS: THE THREAT 
MIDWAY: PLAYING DEAD: THE PLUG.! . 
There was a wolf with Nephew. Wolf played the viola. All 
the birds of the world liked his playing. There was to be a dance 
in another island. They invited Wolf to this dance. Each bird 
gave Wolf a feather to fly there with. The birds danced as he 
played. He sang,— 
“Sir Crow da Graga! 
Indeed, you would be handsomer 
If you did not steal people’s corn in the furrow.

“Goose Miranda, Miranda! 
You would be handsome 
If you did not have that long neck and lean legs. 
“Filili, Pili, Fiah!! 
You would be handsome 
If you were not so sure of yourself. 
“Manélob’ da Silba! 
You would be handsome 
If you did not live on the guts of donkeys and goats. 
“Owl,? pretty Owl! 
You would be handsome 
If you did not have such deep eyes; 
And you are a thief, you go about only at night, 
Because you take the clothes of others to make clothes 
for yourself.” 
Each bird went to Wolf and took away the feather he had loaned 
him. They left Wolf on the island without anything to eat. 
Wolf was overcome by hunger. He saw a whale passing by.‘ 
Whale asked, ‘“‘What’s the matter with you? He answered, 
“My Aunt Whale, all my people have left me here. I want to 
go home to see my wife and children.” Whale said to him, “I’m 
in a hurry, jump on my back! [ll take you home.” As Aunt 
Whale was swimming along, Sir Wolf saw her fat breasts. He 
said, “Oh, what big breasts! I’m going to tear off one of them.” 
Whale asked, “What’s that you say?”—“I said we are near 
land.” As they made land, Wolf jumped off, he tore off one of 
Whale’s breasts. 
Whale staid lying on the beach because she had no breast to 
nurse her children. Nephew came by. He asked, “Mamma 
1 A night-flying bird with the call “filili!” When men sleeping out are kept awake by 
it at night, they may build a fire for Filili to fly into. 
2 An owl’s feathers, it was explained, are of different shades.— When I asked Matheus 
Dias of San Anton if he knew this tale of the birds, he said he knew only about the owl to 
whom each bird had given a feather. Because of this borrowed plumage, Ow! was ashamed 
to go about by day. 
3 Variant: The birds gather to make fun of Wolf. They tell him they have a fine house. 
It is built of cuscus, washed with milk, plastered with clabber. The back-bones of a cow 
make its roof; and the horns, its ratrane (stick put behind door to keep it to). Wolf says 
he is hungry, and asks the birds to take him to their house. Each bird gives him a feather. 
They fly fast, Wolf slowly behind. In mid-sea he alights to rest on an island. While he 
sleeps, the birds pull out their feathers. (Cab’ Verde.) 
4 Variant: In the morning, when he awakes and finds no coffee to drink, he eats one of 
his own fingers. At dinner-time he eats another finger; at supper-time, another. The 
next morning he eats a fourth finger before Aunt Ganga comes by. (Cab’ Verde.)
-P-A-G-E-341
314 Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society. 
Whale, what’s the matter?” Whale said to him, “‘I found Wolf 
on the island, I brought him ashore, for which he paid me by 
carrying off my left breast.” Nephew said, ‘Whale, you lie 
here, act like dead, I'll plan to come and skin you.” Nephew 
went home, he called to his wife; he said, ‘‘Get knives and dishes 
for us to skin a whale lying on the beach.” Wolf heard Nephew; 
he said, “Nephew, if you put a knife in that whale, I will kill you. 
That whale has my mark.”’ Nephew said to Wolf, ‘Well, give 
me a small piece, there’s too much for you.” Sir Wolf ran down 
to the sea, he reached the beach, he threw a stone at Whale. He 
said, “I’m afraid she is still alive.’ Nephew jumped on top of 
Whale, Whale did not stir... Then Wolf jumped on top of Whale. 
Then Whale took him with her fin, she dragged him out to sea. 
Then Wolf cried out, ‘‘Good-by, wife! Good-by!” ? 
Lady Whale took Wolf out a long way; she pulled out all his 
guts, she filled him up with sand She plugged him with a king- 
fish, she left the tail sticking out. Then Whale brought Wolf 
ashore. Sir Wolf went home and took a seat on the mortar.* 
His wife said to him, “You have a very big belly.” Then, as his 
smallest child was playing about the mortar, he saw the fish-tail, 
he pulled it out. The sand ran out. There was the end of Sir 
Wolfs It was only yesterday, as I was coming by from my work, 
I saw his funeral. All his family was mourning. 
1 Variant: Nephew tells Wolf to stand at the foot, he will stand at the head, of the 
“cow;” ie., Aunt Ganga. “No,” says Wolf, “I’m going to stand at the head.” Aunt 
Ganga rips him up and takes out her breast. She fills him with sand, and plugs him with 
afish. (Cab’ Verde.) 
2 Variant: A fish-horse (peix’ cabal’) plays this trick on him. 
3 Variant: He tells the children to make him a seat with a hole in it. 
4 The hollowed-out trunk of the fig-tree, in which corn for the finer grade of meal is 
pounded. A Guinea mortar (pilon di Guiné) is made out of a hard wood from the African 
mainland. A mortar stands from two to three feet high. Three women may pound in it 
at a time with their pestle (po di pilon). The pestle is of spinh’ (spinho is a shrub of hard 
wood; its roots are burned for charcoal). To give the women the time for the pounding 
in preparation for the feast of St. John, a man will play on the drum (¢améor) or drum with 
two short sticks (po di collexa). The women sing as they pound; col/a pilon is what they 
call such singing.— The two coarser grades of meal have been ground between two circular 
stones (muin[o}), the top stone being a piece cut out from the bottom, and turned by a 
wooden handle set into it. The meal is winnowed in a basket about six inches deep, called 
bala di tente. See JAFL 34 : 102-103. 
5 Variant: As Wolf is sitting on the mortar his wife set out for him, his little boy says, 
“Hm! Papa smells of fish.”——“‘Get out of here! You put me toshame!” The boy says 
again, “Hm! Papa smells of fish.”——“If you see the fish, take it out.” The boy pulls 
out the fish, the sand runs down into the mortar, Wolf falls over on his back. His wife 
takes him and fries him, and every morning she gives the children a piece. (Cab’ Verde.)

3032 WOLF’S SHARE: THE THREAT MIDWAY: PLAYING DEAD. 
Wolf.and Nephew made a plan to go fishing. They had to 
swim a little way to a rock. Nephew knew how to swim. Wolf 
could not swim. Nephew took Wolf out on his back. Nephew 
caught all the fish. At last Wolf caught a little fish. He said 
to it, “Your eyes are very big. I’d like to pull them out and eat 
them.” Nephew said, “Uncle Wolf, this is the first fish you have 
caught, and you want to eat its eyes! You are greedy.” They 
went on fishing until Nephew said, “Uncle Wolf, it is time to go 
home. Divide the fish, so we can go.” Uncle Wolf divided the 
fish into four parts. He said, “This is yours. This is mine. 
This i is for him who divides; this, for him who wants it, and that’s 
me.” Nephew took his share on his back and swam off, he left 
Wolf behind.? 
Wolf staid and ate up his fish. There passed by a mother fish- 
horse (ma’ peixe cabal’). Wolf said, “Mother Fish-Horse, take 
me ashore! Nephew has left me here. I can’t get ashore.” 
Mother Fish-Horse answered, ‘“‘Oh, no! you’re a bad fellow. I’m 
going to leave you here.”—‘‘Oh, do take me! Don’t leave me 
here to die! I'll pay you well.”—“Come, then! Get under my 
fin.” After they had gone a little way, Wolf said, “Hm! I feel 
like cutting off that breast of yours.”*—‘‘What did you say, 
Wolf?”—“Oh, I said you were swimming well. We'll be ashore 
soon.” They went on. Wolf said again, “Hm! I feel like cutting 
off that breast.” —‘‘What did you say, Wolf?”—“Oh, I said you 
were a good swimmer. We'll be ashore soon.” When they 
reached the surf, Wolf cut off one of her breasts. Three days 
later Nephew passed by, he saw Fish-Horse. Fish-Horse said to 
him, “Can you bring Wolf to me here? I'll pay you, and I'll 
give you his meat to salt.” Nephew went to Wolf. “O Uncle 
Wolf! I have found a dead fish-horse.”—“ Don’t put your hand 
on her! She’s mine. Wait, and go with me!” He called, 
“Maria! Maria! Bring a big bowl and a little, a big knife and 
a little, a big machad’ and a little, to skin the fish-horse.” 4 Wolf

Vicente.)

went ahead, Maria behind. Fish-Horse lay like dead. Wolf 
went close to her. She grabbed him, she carried him into the sea. 
His wife was crying. He called back, “You fool, don’t cry! 
Fish-Horse is teaching me to swim.” Fish-Horse dived down 
with him. He called to his wife, “Don’t cry! She is teaching 
me to dive.” She dived again. He called, “Cry now! Cry now 
[in a weak voice]!” She brought him ashore dead. Nephew 
skinned him and took him home. 
104. THE STUPID BROTHER: INCRIMINATING THE OTHER FELLOW: 
THE THREAT MIDWAY.? 
There were two brothers,— one named Pedr’, one named 
Galds. They had plenty of manioc, corn, and beans in the house. 
One day Pedr’ went out, Galas staid at home to cook. He started 
to"cook piréo. In the manioc he found gurgu/h’,*he burned up the 
manioc. When Pedr’ came home, he found no supper. Galds 
told Pedr’ he had found gurgudh’ in the manioc, and burned it. 
Next day Pedr’ left him home to cook corn. He found worms 
(biche) in the corn, he burned up the corn. Next day Pedr’ left 
him home to cook beans. He found worms in the beans too, he 
burned up the beans. When Pedr’ came home, he said, “O boy! 
you bring disgrace upon us. Now we have nothing to eat. We 
must go out to look for work.” Pedr’ went ahead, Galds behind. 
Pedr’ called back, “Bring the door in your hand!” (He meant 
toflock the door.) Galas pulled out the door and put it on his 
back. $He said to Pedr’, ‘‘When night falls, our door will serve 
us to sleep on.” Pedr’ said, ““O boy! did you leave the house 
open? I didn’t tell you to bring the door on your back, I told 
you to lock the door.” 
They went to a man’s house, they got a job of looking after the 
cows. That night Galds waited until Pedr’ went to sleep. Then 
he got up, he took a big knife, he cut off the heads of all the cows 
but one heifer. He woke up Pedr’; he said, “ Pedr’, see the work 
you did in your sleep!” Pedr’ was wet all over with blood. He 
said, ““O boy! you bring disgrace upon us. It was you who killed 
a big bowl [calderinh’, calderon]; a little knife, a big knife [facinh’, facon); a little 
machad’, a big machad’ \machadink’, machadon). (San Vicente.)

all these cows. Get ready! We must get out of here before 
morning.” ! 
They took the heifer along with them. Galds said to Pedr’, 
“We are going to kill the heifer in a place where I shall make wind 
and there will be no flies.’ They went on. Galas broke wind, 
and there were one fly and one flea. He said, “Flies and fleas 
gather here. We must walk on another day.” They went on. 
He broke wind, there were no flies and no fleas. “This is the 
place.” They had no fire. Galds stood on his head, put his 
fingers in his mouth and whistled. A hole opened in the ground, 
through it he went down to the home of Devil. Devil was not in, 
only his three children. One of them was a little blind girl. 
They were drinking tea. Galds said he came for fire. The tea 
was molten lead. He grabbed the little girl’s cup and drank 
{what was in] it. He took fire and salt, he went up again to earth 
and started to cook. When Devil came home, the children told 
him about the man who had come for fire and had drunk their tea. 
Devil went up to see who it was. He found Pedr’ and Galas 
cooking the cow. He said, ‘“‘I come to find out which of you went 
to my house to get fire, and took the tea away from my little girl.” 
Galds said, “I didn’t drink any tea. I drank molten lead.”— 
“That is the tea we drink in my house,” said Devil. He was 
angry, he wanted to beat Galas. Galds put up his buttocks, he 
told Pedr’ to put into him the four quarters of the cow, the pots, 
the fire, and the stones the blood had fallen on. He said, “And 
Pedr’, cross your hands, grab Devil, throw him into me too.” 
Devil said, “No need at all for us to fight. Every time you need 
anything, you have only to go to my house for it.” 
They ate, they walked on until they were hungry again. They 
came to a beach. There came two birds,— one the godmother of 
Pedr’, the other the godmother of Gald4s. The birds took the 
boys on their backs to carry them home. Galds had with him a 
little knife. The bird carrying him had a big breast. Galds said, 
“You have a big breast; I’m going to cut it off, because I’m 
hungry.” Godmother asked, “What is that you say?”—“I 
said you were flying well.” Galds waited till she had forgotten, 
then he cut off her breast. She grew weak, she let him fall. He

fell into the sea. Pedr’s godmother let him go too. He too fell 
into the sea. Both were drowned.) . 
The water washed them ashore. There came a turtle, who blew 
on Pedr’; he revived. Pedr’ asked Turtle to blow on Galas. 
“Without Galds, I am nothing in this world.” Turtle said, “I 
won’t blow on Galds. He is bad. If I revive him, he will kill 
me.” Pedr’ said, “No, I won’t let him kill you.” She breathed 
on Galas. He got up; he said, “A turtle here, hungry as we are. 
A turtle here, and you don’t turn her!””— Don’t turn this turtle,” 
said Pedr’. “It is she who gave us life.”’—‘‘I don’t care, I am 
hungry! I must eat!’ They turned the turtle, they killed her, 
they ate.? They were in a place no ships came to. They killed 
all the birds there, they ate them. Then they ate dirt. There 
was no water. The dirt blocked up their stomachs, they died. 
That was the end of their life. 
I0§. THE BOY WHO GAVE LIFE.4 
There was a boy who was born with a diamond in his hand. 
When he was fifteen years old, he could divine anything. Life 
itself he could give to a dead person. Then the king heard of this 
boy who could give life. He sent for him for the princess, who 
was sick. Then the princess died. He gave the princess life. 
The king was very glad. The king asked him if he wanted to 
marry her. The boy said that she would not marry a man, how- 
ever satisfied with him the king was. Then Lady Queen married 
this boy. Sir King also went to live with them, so that when they 
died the boy would give them life. 
Then Wolf heard that there was a man who gave a dead person 
life. Wolf went to the boy, for him not to let him die. The boy 
said, “Only if you give me fifty shots.” Wolf fell on his back, he 
began to fart on the ground. There was fart in the world such 
that all the nations thought there was war. All nations went out

take apiece out of her?” Paul’ asks Pedr’. “No,” answers Pedr’, “‘we don’t know what 
she would do,”—“ What are you saying?” asks the bird. “Nothing, we are only asking 
God to bring us safe to port.” Paul’ asks the same question again. Pedr’ refuses. This 
time the bird drops them on the beach. (San Anton.) Co. . 2 Variant: Paul’ is killed by the fall. Pedr’ is not hurt. He tries in vain to dissuade 
the turtle from reviving Paul’; but she breaks wind on Paul’, and he revives. He says, 
“Brother Pedr’, turtle on shore is turn over.”... They see a steamship. Paul’ says, 
“Turtle shell is in the sea,” and they embark in the shell for the vessel. . (San Anton.) ® Compare Timne, Thomas, 35.

with battleships. When they saw that it was not war and that 
it was the fart of Sir Wolf, all the battleships returned. When 
Wolf stopped, there was a smell that stunk for seven million miles. 
Then that fart began to kill people. The boy started out through- 
out the world to give remedies. The boy fled through the world. 
Every shot in the world is part of that fart of Sir Wolf. 
The story will end the day they put tea on the ground in the 
cold. Every one that tells it adds a point ahead. When he! is 
fifteen years old, he will finish the story. 
106. THE EVIL EYE.? 
I 
Wolf started out to find his nephew. On the road he met a 
lamb. Wolf asked him, “Lamb [Carne’rinh’], where is your 
father?”—“Sir Wolf, my father is dead.”—“Where is your 
mother?”—“ My mother is dead.”—‘What killed them?”—‘“I

they died.”—‘‘Lamb, if you look at me, will I die?” asked Wolf. 
“Sir Wolf, you won’t die if you run.” Wolf ran, ran, ran, till he 
came to a cliff. He turned, he looked back, he saw the lamb with 
his eyes open. He cried, “Lamb, do you see me?” He yelled,

Wolf backed and backed. The boy watched him until he was

Wolf was standing drinking at a brook. Above him stood a

about me going on six months,” said Wolf to the lamb. “Sir 
Wolf, six months ago I was not born.”—~“I don’t care! If it was 
not you, it was your father,” said Wolf2 Lamb was frightened, 
he shut his eyes tight. ‘‘Lamb, why do you shut your eyes so 
tight?” asked Wolf. “Sir Wolf, if I opened my eyes, the world 
would be destroyed.” —‘“‘ Do keep them shut, Lamb! Keep them 
shut as tight as you can, and wait until J have run away!” As 
Wolf ran off, he called back, “Shut your eyes tight, Lamb! 
shut them tight, so not to destroy the world!” Wolf disappeared, 
Lamb went back to the flock and saved himself from the jaws of 
Wolf. 
107.4 THE BIGGEST LIAR: FOILED: STEALING THE ROAD: THE 
EVIL EYE. 
There was a man who could tell more lies than any one else. 
One day he went out with his cow to tell lies. He said that if any 
one could tell more lies than he, he would give him his cow. So 
he went around among the neighbors, but nobody could beat him 
lying. Late that night he came to a little hut, and in it he found a 
little boy asleep.’ He asked the boy to give him a light for his 
pipe. The boy began to shake the fire up and down, until the 
man got tired waiting. “Menin’ [‘little boy’], what are you doing 
with that fire?” asked the man. “‘I am dividing to-day’s from 
yesterday’s, and yesterday’s from day before yesterday’s, to give 
you.” — Menin’, give me some water.” —“All right,” said the little

tired waiting. ‘Why don’t you give me the water?” asked the 
man. “Iam dividing to-day’s water from yesterday’s, and yester- 
day’s water from the day before yesterday’s, so as to give you 
fresh water.” —“ Menin’, have you any mother?”—“ Yes, Sehnor!” 
—Where is she?”—‘‘She has gone to the king’s palace to sew it 
up with her needle and thread where it was torn last night.”— 
“What!” exclaimed the man. “And where is your father?” — 
“He has gone to the river to get some water to throw on the land 
with a flower-pot with a hole in it, to make a garden.” 2—“Is 
that so?” said the man. ‘“‘Menin’, did you hear that a child was 
born last night with seven arms, seven legs, and seven necks?” — 
“Sehnor, I can’t be sure; but this morning, when I went to the 
spring for water, I found a dress with seven sleeves and seven 
collars, and I think it must have belonged to that baby.” ’—‘Is 
that so?” said the man. “Menin’, did you hear that a donkey 
took a journey into the sky last week?”-——‘‘Sehnor, I can’t be sure; 
but when I went to the spring last week, I heard a clap of thunder; 
when I looked up, I saw a pack-saddle [a/bada] falling down from 
the sky, and I think it must have belonged to that donkey.”— 
“Menin’, did you hear last week that the river caught fire?” — 
“Sehnor, I can’t be sure; but last week, when we went fishing, 
we caught a lot of fish burnt on one side, raw on the other. I think 
they must have been cooked when the river caught fire.” ‘~My 
dear Menin’, take my cow. You are the smartest fellow I ever 
saw.” 5 
On his way home he met ’Nhd’ Lob’* “Sehnor, what are you 
thinking of?” asked Lob’. “You look so sad!”—‘You may well 
ask me. I had a cow, I thought nobody could take it from me.

trees to sea.” —“That’s true, it was the same storm that rained pack-saddles.”—~“ What 
news? I hear they have caught fish cooked on one side, raw on the other.”—“That’ 's true, 
Perhaps the fish were in that boat that was burned when the sea caught on fire.”—“ What 
news? I hear that a bird has been flying over the city for three days, and has not yet 
traversed the city.”—“That’s true. I met a man with a pick-axe and sledge-hammer to 
break the egg of that bird.”—“What news? I hear that a child has been born with seven 
arms.” —“That’s true. As I was passing, they were washing clothes, and I saw a shirt 
with seven sleeves.” .

I thought I was the biggest liar in the world, so I said I would give 
the cow to any one who could beat me lying. Then I met an 
innocent little child who told more lies than me, so I had to give 
him the cow. Now, I don’t know what to do to get the cow back 
from him.”—‘‘Come right back to him with me!” said ’Nhé’ 
Lob’, “T’ll get the cow for you. I have seven bags here full of 
lies. IfI open but one of my bags, the whole town will be covered 
with lies.”—‘‘All right,” said the man, “let us go!”? And the 
man went on ahead. The little boy heard a noise outside; and 
when he looked, he saw the man and ’Nhé’ Lob’ coming towards 
his house. “’Nhé’ Lob’ is coming to take my cow,” he said; 
“what can I do?” He called out to the man, “How about the 
seven pregnant wolves you promised my father? You’re only 
bringing one of them.! All right, though! Bring him in. 
We'll tie him and kill him.”—“‘ What! tie me and kill me! Is that 
why you brought me here? You can’t get me!” And ’Nhéd’ 
Lob’ started to run home as fast as a horse. 
“Sehnor, why are you standing here?” asked the little boy. 
“Just wait until ’Nhé’ Lob’ steals the road and puts it in his pocket. 
How will you find the way home then?”—“ What!” said the man, 
and he started running after "Nhé’; Lob’ to catch him before he 
stole the road and put it in his pocket. Every time ’Nhé’ Lob’ 
looked back, he saw the man running after him. So he kept on 
running, because he thought the man was after him to bring him 
to the child’s father. So he ran till he came to a mountain, where 
he hid. When the man lost sight of ’Nhd’ Lob’, he fell off the 
mountain, and he was killed. 
Three days later the little boy went to the mountain to get some 
hay for his cow. ’Nhéd’ Lob’ was walking there, and he saw the 
little boy. ’Nhé’ Lob’ was awfully hungry, because he hadn’t 
eaten for three days. When he saw the child, he said to himself, 
“°Nhd’ Lob’, to-day you'll have a big feast.” When the little boy 
saw him, he hung his head. “Menin’, why are you so sad?” 
asked ’Nhé’ Lob’. “Have you any mother?”—“No,” answered 
the little boy, “‘my mother is dead.”—‘What did she die of? ”"— 
“She died Because I looked at her.”—‘ And your father?” —‘‘He 
is dead too.”—‘‘ What did he die of?” —‘‘He died, too, because I 
looked at him. Everybody that I look at dies.’”—~‘ What!” 
exclaimed ’Nhd’ Lob’, “‘are you looking at me?”—‘‘No, not yet,

but I shall pretty soon.” And ’Nhé’ Lob’ kept running backwards 
as fast as he could, so the child would not see him. When he 
reached the side of the mountain, the little boy called out, “In 
just a minute I’ll be seeing you. J almost saw you!” ’Nhé’ Lob’ 
ran, and fell down the mountain and was killed. The little boy 
went home happy because he had his cow, and because he was the

108.1 PEDR’ TRANSFORMS: PLAYING DEAD. 
Once Wolf planned to go into the country with Pedr’, his 
nephew. Isabél Gongale put a gufong? and a palma? of tobacco 
for Wolf in his bag (saralh’) ; Pedr’s wife put the same for him in 
his bag. After they got out, Wolf said, “Nephew, let us eat first 
out of your bag!”—‘‘No, Uncle Wolf, we'll eat first out of yours. 
You are an old man, I am young. We'll lighten your load first.” 
But Wolf insisted, they ate first out of Pedr’s bag. They ate and 
smoked. Finally they had eaten everything in Pedr’s bag. Pedr’ 
was hungry. He said, “Uncle Wolf, give me some of yours!” 
Wolf would not give him anything to eat. “Uncle Wolf, we came 
together, we ought to die together.” Wolf said, “If you die, I'll 
carry you on my back.”—‘‘Uncle Wolf, give me something!” — 
“Go on, you rascal [maro?’]! This food here is for my wife and 
children.” When they. started to come in from the country, 
Pedr’ was weak from hunger, but he went on ahead of Wolf. 
Wolf held back to eat. Near Wolf’s house was a spring. Pedr’ 
drank, he turned into a head-rest (ordilia). Wolf reached the 
spring, he saw the head-rest; he said, “My wife has been here and

dropped her head-rest.” He picked it up and put it in his bag. 
Pedr’ turned into a rabbit, he started to eat the gufong. When 
Wolf arrived home, he asked Isabél Gongale, ‘‘ Where is Pedr’?’” 
—T haven’t seen Pedr’.” Wolf said, “I fooled Nephew. We 
ate up all he had in his bag, and saved mine. I brought it back 
for you to eat.” She was pleased, she tipped up the bag to get 
the gufong. Out fell a crumb and a rabbit.!. The rabbit ran into 
a hole. 
Wolf said, “This is a trick, you see, of Nephew. I’m going to 
plan to kill him. Get a sheet and a pillow, and I will lie on a 
bench as if dead. When the shroud (mortelhar) is all ready, go 
out and cry, ‘Wolf is dead! Wolf is dead!’ Nephew will come 
to see what is the matter.” They arranged all this; Pedr’ came; 
Isabél Gongale cried, “ Pedr’, O Pedr’! your Uncle Wolf is dead!” 
Pedr’ came in; he cried, ‘““O Uncle Wolf! you are dead, you are 
dead, and I have no companion.” Pedr’ asked Isabél Goncale, 
“When Uncle Wolf died, did he break wind?”—‘‘No.” Wolf 
heard, he broke wind like thunder. Pedr’ said, “Uncle Wolf is 
not dead, Uncle Wolf is alive.” 
10g. A STORM COMING? 
There was a wolf with a nephew. Uncle Wolf was lazy, he ate 
everything in sight. Nephew was a worker. They set to work 
to plant manioc. Nephew dug the soil, he planted his manioc- 
shoots. Uncle Wolf ate up all his shoots. Well, Uncle Wolf saw 
Nephew’s plants growing up; he went and said to Nephew, “I am 
hungry. I wish you would give me some of that manioc.”—“It 
isn’t good to eat yet,” answered Nephew. Wolf said, ‘Then 
give me something to eat. I’d like to try that manioc.” He 
tormented Nephew until he pulled up a plant and gave it to him. 
Uncle Wolf liked it very much. He made a plan to run Nephew 
out and keep the manioc-patch for himself. He ran Nephew 
out. Two days passed. Nephew cut carapate; he made two 
ropes, each twenty-five fathoms. He passed by Wolf’s house. 
Wolf saw him; he asked him, “What are you going to do with all 
1 Coelh’. To many the word seems to mean “rat” or “mouse.” There was always a 
discussion over its meaning.

that rope?” Nephew pointed to a black cloud in the north. 
“Well, what is it?’”—‘“‘That cloud is a tempest coming, which is 
going to kill everything not tied up,” answered Nephew. “Sell 
me some rope!” begged Wolf. “‘I can’t sell this rope,” said 
Nephew. “I’m going to tie myself up with it toa tree.” Nephew 
started to tie himself. ‘Tie me first!” begged Wolf. So Nephew 
tied him fast to the foot of a fig-tree. He spliced the two ropes 
together, he tied him fast. He left him there. His bones are 
there yet. 
(Variant a.) 
There was a wolf with his nephew. They went into the country 
one day to beg. They went to a sugarcane plantation where 
they were making sugar. They gave them a case of sugar. 
They went to a brook, they put the sugar in the running water. 
“Uncle Wolf, do you drink below [the sugar], I will drink above,” 
said Nephew. ‘‘You are very bold, Nephew! You want me to 
drink the dirty water, and you to drink the pure water. Drink 
below yourself! I’m going to drink above.” They went to a 
plain where there was a deserted [property], there were an orange- 
grove, a lemon-grove, cocoanuts. They worked together, they 
cleaned up the trees; but when the time came to gather the fruit, 
Wolf ran Nephew out, he kept the place for himself. After a 
while Nephew came back with some rope; he said, “‘Sir Wolf, do 
you know if there is rope for sale about here?” —“ What do you 
want with rope?””—“T heard that a storm is coming which will 
carry off everybody. I want to tie myself up, so the storm won’t 
carry me off with the others.” Uncle Wolf said, “O Nephew! 
come in, come in! I want to talk to you. Let me tell you what 
I want you to do. I have some rope here. Please tie me up 
before you go.” They got together all the rope in the house. 
Nephew tied Wolf to the foot of a tree. He left only his buttocks

See, too, p. 319. The point of the incident, however, is different. Nephew wants to 
drink below the block of sugar, where the water has been sweetened; but, knowing Wolf’s 
contrary nature, he plays up to it, and tells him to drink below.

bare, he cut some sticks from a quince-tree, he whipped Uncle 
Wolf until he died. Nephew took possession of the place. 
TIO. HOW TO EAT MONKEY.! 
[After the preceding episode, Nephew had left Wolf tied to a 
fig-tree.]_ Four or five days later a monkey came up to the fig- 
tree where Wolf was tied, and began to eat the figs. ‘‘Throw me 
a fig, Sir Monkey! I’m very hungry!” begged Wolf. Monkey 
threw him a fig. As he threw it, it fell into his mouth. “Untie 
me, Sir Monkey!” begged Wolf again. ‘‘No, I won’t loosen you, 
because you are not a man to be trusted,” answered Monkey. 
“T will give you my land and everything on it,” promised Wolf. 
“No, I won’t loosen you, you are not a man to be trusted,” said 
Monkey again. “Do loosen me, Sir Monkey! Indeed, I will 
give you my land and everything on it.” Monkey again refused. 
Four times Wolf begged Monkey, and Monkey refused; but finally 
Monkey agreed to loosen him. 
When he untied him, Wolf grabbed hold of Monkey’s tail. 
“Why are you holding my tail, Uncle Wolf?” asked Monkey. 
“My hand is cramped, because I’ve been tied up a long time. I 
want to wake it up.”—‘‘Uncle Wolf, let me go, please! Let me 
go! See how good I’ve been to you!”—‘‘No, I’m not going to 
let you go. I’m going to kill you and eat you up right here.” 
At the time, Nephew was near by, on a hill. He called out, 
“O Uncle Wolf! shall I tell you the best way to eat Monkey? 
Tie his feet together, throw him up in the air. He'll come down 
and fall into your mouth, you won’t lose the tip of a hair.”— 
“Nephew, you’re a smart boy! That’s the way!” And Wolf 
took Monkey, he threw him up into the air with all his might. 
When he fell down, he fell away out of sight. Wolf waited there 
with his mouth open one day. “I'll reward you, Nephew, be- 
cause you saved me from Uncle Wolf,” said Monkey. 
III. THE THINGS THAT TALKED.” 
There was once a shepherd with his dog. They went into the 
country. On his return he was hungry. He came across a fig- 
tree bearing ripe figs. There were also figs on the ground. He 
began to eat the figs on the ground. After he had eaten well, he

noticed that the tree was covered with figs. The fig-tree said, 
“If you want to eat from me, don’t eat from the ground.” He 
looked at the dog. The dog said, “Speak to the fig-tree which 
speaks to you.” He took a stick to beat the dog. The stick 
said, “Speak to the dog that speaks to you.” He dropped the 
stick and started torun. He ran until he met a man with a stick 
on his back. The man said, ‘‘Why are you running?”—“I came 
across a fig-tree. There were figs on the ground. I ate the figs. 
T noticed the figs on the tree. The fig-tree told me to eat from it. 
I looked at the dog. The dog said, ‘Speak to the fig-tree which 
speaks to you.’ I took a stick to beat the dog. The stick said, 
‘Speak to the dog that speaks to you.’ I dropped the stick and 
started to run.”—‘‘You are a good-for-nothing [desprisiad’],” 
said the man. The stick on his back said, ‘“‘Had it been you, you 
would have done likewise.” The man dropped the stick. Both 
men started running, the stick after them. They ran, ran, ran, 
until they ran into the sea. 
I12, SEVEN SUITS OF CLOTHES.) 
There was a very rich family with one son. There was a poor 
family with one son. The two boys looked alike. People would 
call the poor boy by the name of the rich, the rich by the name of 
the poor. One day the rich boy met the poor boy. He said, “I 
am glad to meet you. I heard you looked just like me.” He 
invited him to go in bathing. ‘You put on my clothes,” said 
the rich boy, ‘‘and I will put on yours.” They exchanged clothes. 
The rich boy took the poor boy home, and the mother of the rich 
boy took the poor boy for her own son. “That isnot me. This 
is me,” said her son. They kept the poor boy to live with them. 
At the table he was bashful and would not talk. The father of the 
rich boy was an old man. To make the poor boy talk, the old 
man said, “Unless you talk, I will kill you.” The poor boy said 
not a word. The next morning he rose early, he went to his 
friend’s room; he asked him to give him a horse, that he might go 
through the world to find something to talk about. “My father 
was only testing you,” said the rich boy. “I don’t want you to 
go.” But the poor boy insisted on going. 
As he rode through the country, he came to a house on the 
shore. He knocked at the door. A little woman opened it.

“Enter,” said she, “and sit down in the parlor [sa/a].” She 
asked him where he came from. “From the city — on an excur- 
sion.”—‘“You are hungry, naturally?”—‘‘Yes.”—“What kind 
of soup are you used to eating,— tapioca, or chicken?”— 
“Chicken.” When night came on, she said, ‘What kind of a bed 
are you used to,— a bed of lead, or one of silver or of gold?” — 
“A bed of gold.” 
The house belonged to three enchanted princesses. The gold 
bed belonged to the eldest sister; the silver bed, to the other two; 
the lead bed, to the servant. The servant took him to the gold 
bed. About one in the morning the three princesses came in. 
The boy was asleep. He turned in bed, he felt something cold. 
He lighted a taper, he saw a girl lying there. He was so aston- 
ished, she was so pretty, that he did not notice a drop of wax 
falling on her face. She woke-up. She called him an impudent 
fellow. “What right have you to drop wax on my face?” 
He took such pleasure in her company, that morning came 
before he knew it. She told him that he was not to carry news of 
her, no matter where he went. That morning he rode back to the 
house of the rich boy. They were at breakfast. Half way 
through the meal the poor boy said to the rich, “I have a piece of 
news for you. Last night in a certain house I saw a face un- 
equalled in this land.” They were astonished. The old man said 
he desired to see that face. “Bring her for me to see, and I will 
give you half my riches. Fail to bring her, and I will turn you 
away.” The same day the poor boy started back to the house of 
the princesses. The same woman as before opened the door. 
She said, “Sir, you remember my lady told you not to carry news 
of her anywhere. She may not help you in your affair, but sit 
down and wait for her.” At the same hour as before the three 
ptincesses arrived. The eldest said as soon as she saw him, “Did 
I not tell you not to carry news of me anywhere?” He said, 
“Help me out of my disgrace! I come from a poor family. I live 
now in arich family. I went out into the world to find something 
to talk about. I found nothing of beauty but you.” But the 
princess refused to go with him. Her sisters begged her to go. 
“He is too fine a young fellow to be disgraced.”” She agreed to 
go; she said, “To-morrow, about noon, you will see three white 
doves flying towards you. Give orders for a piece of white silk 
to be spread out for us to go in, and another to go out, on.” . Next 
morning, as he was impatiently pacing the verandah, he saw the 
three white doves approach. As they touched the white silk,

they were transformed into three girls, the eldest in the centre. 
As the people went to meet them, they fell on their knees, they 
took them for saints. ‘Arise! We are people, just like you,” 
they said. They took them into the reception room (sala de 
visite). When it was time for them to go, they put down another 
piece of white silk. 
The boy rode to the house of the princesses to thank them for 
coming. The servant said, ‘““My lady is angry with you. On 
the way back she lost her enchanted ring in the sea. She blames 
you for it.” She told the lady he had come. She said to him, 
“T do not wish to see you. It was due to you that I lost the most 
precious jewel in the world.” He was very sad. He asked them 
to give him a fishing-rod. ‘‘Why?”—‘“TI want to go fishing to 
find the ring.” They gave him a fishing-rod. 
He went to the sea and began to fish. He felt a bite, he pulled 
up a sargosinh’. He was hungry; he was considering eating the 
fish raw, when the fish said, “Do not eat me! I will tell you 
about the ring you are looking for.”—“‘How am I to find it?”?— 
“After a while a coradante [?| will come, and then a maria alcatras 
{a bird]. Iwill come too. The coradante will take the poison out 
of the well, so we can drink. I am going to sing,— 
“*Clac, clac! Cumadre Maria Alcatras 
Ja ficou sem o seu anél de pédra do incanto. 
Assim som’ que nad’ tenha nada.’ 
[<*Clac, clac!. Cumadre Maria Alcatras 
Is left without her ring with an enchanted stone. 
So it appears that nothing has nothing.’] 
When I sing, do you wave your rod. Maria Alcatras will drop 
the ring to drink, and you can get it. Let me advise you. When 
you take her the ring, she will wish to marry you. At her marriage 
she will wear seven undershirts: You too must wear seven. She 
will wear seven [pairs of] corsets [curpis]. You must wear seven 
camisolos. She will wear seven white petticoats. You must 
wear seven pairs of drawers. She will wear seven skirts. You 
must wear seven pairs of trousers. She will wear seven jackets. 
‘You must wear seven coats. When she prepares for the bridal 
bed [to/do}, she will race you in undressing. Watchher. The last 
piece she takes off do you throw into a pan of fire under the bed. 
Thus you will break her enchantment, then you will enjoy her.” 
He got the ring; he went back to the girl’s house, thinking he 
had the ring in his pocket. On arriving, he found the ring on the

girl’s finger. She was glad to see him; she said, “The only way 
to repay you is to marry you.” They prepared a big dinner for 
the wedding. They invited the family of the rich boy. The old 
man brought with him half of his riches; after the ceremony and 
the dinner, he gave them to the groom in order to fulfil his promise. 
“Tl not lie with a man who wears seven pairs of trousers,” 
said the woman. ‘‘Nor I with a woman who wears seven skirts,” 
said he. They took them off one by one. “T’ll not lie with a 
man who wears seven coats,” said she. “Nor I with a woman 
who wears seven jackets,” said he. “I'll not lie with a man who 
wears seven pairs of drawers.”—“‘Nor I with a woman who wears 
seven petticoats.”—‘T’ll not lie with a man who wears seven 
shirts.” —“‘Nor I with a woman who wears seven [pairs of] corsets.” 
— “Tl not lie with a man who wears seven undershirts.”—“‘ Nor I 
with a woman who wears seven.” As she took off her last shirt, 
he grabbed it and threw it into the fire. She cried out, “My 
husband, you disgrace me! You break my enchantment!” 
The guests left them, and there they lived to enjoy their wealth. 
113. THE GIRL WHO WOULD DANCE) 
There was a woman married. She had a daughter by her 
husband. The girl knew how to do nothing but dance the batuc’. 
Wherever they played the violin, she would go and dance; where- 
ever outside they played the drum, she would dance; whenever 
they played the simbo, she would dance. That was all she did. 
Because that was not right, her father turned her out. She 
worked, she built herself a house. She reared.up a little dog. 
A man who was a wild dragon appeared on a little hill which 
was by her house; he sang,— 
“Zabél, Zabél, hold your dog! 
Let me into your house! 
I will bring you a sack of money, 
T will bring you a form of cuscus 
And a bottle of molasses.” 
The little dog barked,— 
“Yep! Yep! 
Zabél is not here, 
Yep! Yep! 
Zabél is asleep with nightmare.”

The man turned back to his house, because the dog did not let 
him fin]. 
Next day, very early, the girl went to ask the said’ what to do 
with the dog, because a man had come bringing her things, and the 
dog did not let him in. The said’ said, “The dog was fighting 
for your good, because that man was not human [people].” Zabél 
said, “Yes, he is somebody, and the dog won’t let him in.” The 
sail’ said, “Kill the dog, burn him, put the ashes in a basket 
covered with seven shawls, throw the basket into the sea, tying 
stones to the basket to sink it. The dog will not again keep the 
man from coming inside.” Zabél did all this. 
That night the man appeared again on the hill. He sang,— 
“Zabél, Zabél, hold your dog! 
I am coming to your house, 
I am bringing you a sack of money, 
I am bringing you a form of cuscus 
And a bottle of molasses.” 
He heard no barking, he came nearer; he sang again,— 
. “Zabél, Zabél, hold your dog! 
Tam coming to your house, 
I am bringing you a sack of money, 
I am bringing you a form of cuscus 
And a bottle of molasses.” 
He reached the door. He sang again,— 
“Zabél, Zabél, hold your dog! 
I am coming to your house, 
Tam bringing you a sack of money, 
Tam bringing you a form of cuscus 
And a bottle of molasses.” 
The place was quiet. He opened the door. Zabél saw his feet. 
She said, ‘‘Where are you going with those big feet?” —“To mash 
you.” Then the wild dragon jumped, and seized her by the neck. 
He took her to her father’s house. She began to cry. She 
said, “My father, my father! the wild dragon with seven heads is 
taking me! He is very heavy, I can’t manage him.” Her father 
answered her,— 
“Zabél, Zabél, going to the ravine!

She went to the house of a new friend She cried; she said,

friend answered her,—

answered her,—

1 Before this, our informant had her visiting her sister, and then her brother. Mr. 
Silva, who helped me as usual in recording the tale, objected to including these visits, 
urging that Zabél was an only child. Our informant had overlooked this initial fact, of 
course, and was hypothecating relatives for the sake of repetition, just as is done in balladry 
or in the “spirituals” of the American Negroes.

The old friend took his gun, he shot at the wild dragon. With 
only one shot he blew off the seven heads. They lived like 
brother and sister in the same house. The other day I left them 
still living together. 
(Variant a2) 
What thing thing? There was a Sabél who had a dog called 
Leon. And there was now a man who wanted to kill her. He 
waited until night, he came, he offered her a sackful of money. 
“Sabé belele, Sabé belele, 
Hold your dog! 
I am going to join you. 
I am bringing you a sack of money, 
Sack of money.” 
The dog answered,— 
“Hep! Hep! Hep! 
Hep! Hep! Hep!

Then she went and told her family that she was going to kill her 
dog. The family said not to kill him, because he was her com- 
panion. Then she went, she arrived, she killed the dog. At 
night the man came, he called her, he offered her a sack of money.

The dead dog answered,— 
“Hep! Hep! Hep!

Then she woke up, she went and buried the dog she had killed.

Nothing answered him. As he called, he advanced. As soon as 
he got near the house, everything began to turn over inside the 
house. When he arrived in that turmoil, the door opened without 
any one opening it, and then he went inside the house. Sabél 
said, “And you, what big eyes you have!”—“ Big eyes for me to 
see you.” —“What great hands you have!”—“Great hands are 
for me to seize you.” She said, “What great feet you have!” 
He said, “Great feet are for me to go with you.” Then he killed 
the girl, Thus it was. 
Il4., THE BATTLE OF THE ENCHANTERS! 
There were a man and a woman. They had a very lazy son. 
One day his father sent him to go open the store. His father 
mounted him on a donkey. He went to the store. When he 
reached the door of the store, the donkey stopped. He said, 
“Now, lazy as I am, I am not going to get off to open the door.” 
He staid there till night. People came to do business, he did not 
get off to sell anything. At night, when he came home, his father 
asked him what he sold. He said that he sold nothing. “Did 
people not come to buy?”—“‘They came, but I did not open the 
door, they went away.” His father jeered at him. His mother 
said, “Don’t jeer at my son!” 
Next day he asked his father to make him a line and hook, he 
was going fishing. His father said, “‘Good-for-nothing! you want 
to be a fisherman! I sent you to the store, you did not like it, 
now you want to go fishing.” His mother said, ‘Go arrange a 
line and hook for him to go fishing!” Then his father arranged 
aline and hook. He went to the sea to fish. He took three days 
to get to the sea. When he arrived, he lay down behind a stone. 
Then he saw some men coming on horseback. When they arrived, 
they made the rock open, they entered. The next day they came 
out, they went away. He saw all they did. After his father 
found that he was late returning, he went to find him. When he 
arrived where his son was, when he was there, those men arrived. 
He said to them, “‘I want you to teach my son for me.” The men 
were seven robbers. They said, “Yes, but on condition that you 
come to take your son at the end of seven years.” He agreed. 
The captain gave him a receipt to bring in seven years and fetch

his son. He went home, he told his wife that he had put their son 
in school, to go get him in seven years. “There is the receipt to 
fetch him when the seven years are over.” He dug a hole at the 
foot of his bed. He buried the receipt seven hands deep. 
Every day the robbers went out, they left him in the house; 
but the captain said to him, “You may go everywhere but into 
that room there;! do not touch [anything] in it.” When the 
captain went out, he went into that room, he took all the books 
that were there, he studied until he knew all they knew. Well, 
one day the sergeant said to the captain, “You better take 
care with that boy, because he is smart.”’ The captain answered, 
“Oh, he knows nothing.” The sergeant said, “Well, you know 
it all.” 
At this time the boy knew every place where they stole. Then 
one day he asked the captain for permission to go and see his 
father. That very day they stole from his father a sack of money 
that his father had marked. He took this sack of money, he went 
out to go and see his father. When he reached home, he asked 
his father, ‘“‘Where’s the sack of money you had in such a place?” 
His father looked, he did not find it, he said he lost it. He said 
to his father, “Here is the sack with your money.” His father 
opened the sack, he looked in, he saw that it was his sack of money. 
Then he asked his father, “Where do you keep that receipt? 
You see that on the day my time is up, if you lose that receipt, 
you lose me.”’ His father looked for the receipt where he put it, 
he did not find it. His son said, “Dig deeper, seven arms deep, 
you will find it.” The father dug seven arms deep, he found it. 
He said, “Good! On the day my time is up, when you come to 
get me, he will not want to give me to you, but he will give you 
three doves in a cage for you to choose. Of these three doves, 
do you take the poorest and ugliest of all. He will ask you, ‘Why 
do you not take the prettiest?’ You will say to him that that one 
you like. That one is me. If you take any other, you will lose 
me.” He said, ‘““Good-by!”” He went. 
Well, when the time was up, the father went to get hisson. He 
arrived; he said, “Good-day, captain!—Good-day, friends! I 
come to get my son.” He delivered the receipt to the captain. 
The captain gave him a cage with three doves to choose one. He 
took the ugliest of all. The captain said to him, “Why don’t you 
take the prettiest?” —‘This pleases me.” The sergeant said to

the captain, “You see, now, what I told you?” Then after that 
the captain delivered to him his son. They went home. 
When they reached home, a day came when he said to his 
father, “To-day is the day the captain is going to ride to a certain 
place where there are birds of gold. We will get up early, we will 
go there, we will arrive there before him, we will take the birds.” 
They went, they took the birds. When they took the birds, he 
said to his father, “I will become a donkey; do you put these 
birds upon it, and pass by the door of the king. He will want to 
buy them, he will offer you fifty thousand reis for each one. Do 
you refuse; tell him only if he will give you one hundred thousand 
reis for each one, will you sell them. But when you sell them, 
donkey and all, do you take only the cord which is on the neck of 
the donkey, because that cord is me.” He passed by. The king 
offered to buy. He sold them as his son told him; but he was 
entranced with so much money, he forgot to take off the cord. 
He went home. 
When the son saw that his father had forgotten, he was con- 
fused. The king sent to put the birds in the room of the princess. 
Well, when the princess lay down and went to sleep, the birds 
turned into the boy. He took the princess by the nose. The 
princess was frightened, she cried for her father. She said that 
some one was inside her room. The king said to her, “You are 
crazy; where did any one come out from here?” She cried out 
again. The king came and looked everywhere, he found nothing. 
He said to her, “If you cry for me again, I will come here. I will 
settle you.” Well, the king went and lay down. Again [the boy] 
caught the princess by the nose. The princess started to cry, but 
she did not cry, for fear of the king. The boy said to her, “I ama 
person. See! your father has been sick for some time, he has been 
treated by all the doctors there are, he does not get better. Ona 
certain day there will come here a doctor to cure him, who will 
cure him of his sickness; but he will not want to receive any 
money, except this ring that I give you. Your father will not 
want [to give it], but don’t you mind! Tell him you will give 
him the ring; but when you give him the ring, take the ring off 
your finger with your left hand, you reach it out.” 
He went out, he went to the house of his father. When he 
reached the house, he said to his father, “What did you do? 
You forgot what I said, you were in such a hurry, but still it is all 
right. To-morrow is the day for a horse-race in the city. We

will go there. My master will be there. I shall win from him, 
because he is old, I am younger than he. He will come on a very 
pretty black horse, I will change into a little white horse all 
harnessed. You will ride it, I will run, I will pass him. When I 
pass him, he will offer to buy your horse. You tell him yes, if he 
gives you five hundred thousand reis, you will sell him the horse; 
but you will take off the bridle. If you do not take off the bridle, 
you will lose me.” They went to the races. He passed the other 
horse. As soon as he passed, that captain proposed to him to 
buy. He sold him as his son told him, but he was entranced with 
so much money, he forgot to take off the bridle. 
When the boy saw that he had forgotten and that he was in the 
hands of the captain, he made the captain have diarrhoea. The 
captain turned to a man. He said, “Take this horse for me. I 
am going to the little house, but don’t take off the bridle.” There 
stood a bank of water. All the great men of the city were there. 
The horse began to pull to drink in the tank. The man began to 
pull him, he did not want to let him drink. The governor of the 
city said to him, ‘You slouch! A horse like that you keep from 
drinking! Let him drink!”” When the captain knew that he 
was drinking, he came out from the little house, coming with his 
trousers in his hand. The man took the bridle off the horse to 
drink. The captain arrived in a hurry to take it. When he 
reached out his hand to take it, he [the boy] turned into a sainha. 
He jumped inside the tank of water. The captain turned into a 
shark. He jumped inside the water after him. He made off. 
Now he could not see where he was. He ran afterhim. Taifnha 
came to the top of the water, the shark after him. He changed 
into a dove of gold, he flew into the sky. The captain changed 
into a falcon, he flew after him. He flew until he arrived over the 
house of the king. He came down, he entered the window of the 
king, he alighted on the lap of the princess. The princess said, 
“O father! see how yesterday you bought for me a golden bird, 
to-day God sends me a little golden dove!” The king said, 
“Some falcon is after him.” The king took his gun, he went out 
on the verandah, he saw the falcon spying, he started to fire at 
him. The falcon flew away. 
Early the next day a doctor came to the door of the king with 
all his cures. He knocked at the door, they asked him what he 
wanted. He said that he came to cure the king of an ailment 
that he had had for many years. They had him come in. He

treated the king, he cured him. The king asked him what it cost. 
He said that he would charge him nothing, he desired only a ring 
which the princess had on her finger. The king said, “No, I 
have money to pay you what you ask, not the ring of my daugh- 
ter.” The princess answered, “What is a ring!” The princess 
pulled off the ring with her left hand, she held it out. When he 
started to. take it, the princess let the ring fall on the ground. It 
changed into a guarta of corn. The doctor turned into a falcon. 
He started to gather up the corn, he swallowed it. A grain 
rolled, it thrust itself under the foot of the princess. The falcon 
ate all the corn until only that grain was left. He turned his neck 
to take it under the foot of the princess. The corn changed into 
a razor, it cut, the neck of the falcon. Just here was the end of the 
captain. 
Then the king married him to the princess. He sent for his 
father and mother. They all came to live at the palace. Only 
yesterday I passed by there, they were all sitting on the verandah. 
J1§. THE TEST! 
There were two gamblers, José and Jon. They played at disg. 
José won nine times; Jon, four times. Jon slapped José. Four 
teeth fell out, nineteen became loose. José went home. He 
had as many children as would reach from here to New Bedford. 
He called to them in order to bite them with his loose teeth to see 
which had most courage. Not one showed courage. His wife 
said, “Try to remember if you have any outside children.” José 
said, “I have one, but it is as if he were not. Since his birth I 
have not given him even a needle to patch his old shirt.” But 
José called him, and to test his courage he bit him. The boy 
said, “Were you not my father, I would kill you.” The father 
said to the boy, “I had a bet with a man; he slapped me, and

116! THE TEST: THE SLEEPER KING. 
There was a king. His wife died. _He started out into the 
world. He had one hundred girls, all of them became pregnant. 
Ninety-nine of them he took care of. One he neglected, she was 
too ugly. When he found all of them pregnant, he went to live 
in the woods. The children were born, all boys. One was born 
with a mark on the back of his hand,— Jon de Mon Stofilan. 
The king went one day to visit his compadre. He sat down in 
the chair his compadre swore, if any one but himself sat in it, he 
would slap him. His compadre slapped him, and kicked out all 
his teeth but two,— one above, one below. He said, ““Compadre, 
you have done this to me because you are young and I am old; 
but I am the father of ninety-nine sons.” He went home, he 
called his children one by one. ‘What do you want?”—“The 
doctor pulled out all my teeth to get out a little piece of bone. 
See if you can get it out.” As they tried, he bit their fingers 
until they cried. “You can’t help me,” said he. He thought, 
“T am not the father of ninety-nine, I am the father of one hun- 
dred.” He wrote to the son he had neglected. The son read the 
letter; he said, “Mother, have I a father?”—‘‘No, you have no 
father.”—‘‘How was I born without a father?”—‘‘You have a 
father, but he neglected us. I do not call him your father.”— 
“‘Well, he has summoned me, I am going.” When the boy ar- 
rived, his father said, ‘‘My son, you are the only one of my sons 
I have faith in. Take this bone out of my teeth. The doctor 
pulled out all my teeth to get it out. See if you can get it out.”— 
“What do you want me to take it out with?”—“With your 
fingers.” The father chewed his fingers to the knuckles. “Is 
that why you called me? Were you not my father, I would slap 
you.” His father slapped him on the back. “Good! You are 
the only one of my sons who can help me.”” He told his son about 
his compadre. 
The boy went to the house of the compadre, he sat on the same 
chair his father had sat on. ‘Don’t you know your father sat 
in that chair,” said the compadre, “and I slapped him and knocked 
out all his teeth but two?” —‘‘Come and slap me! You will find 
aman.” He pulled out his sword and cut off the man’s head. 
The head spun, he caught it on the tip of his sword. He threw 
the head on his father’s verandah. The father got a stick to

beat the head. ‘“‘Were you not my father, I would beat you as 
you would beat that head.”—‘“Why?”—“ Because vengeance 
ends with death.” 
The saib’ knew this boy was too valiant (da/ent’), and so with 
another king he planned his death. The boy got a letter saying 
that the king wanted the fat of a forest lion (/ion de mat’). He 
_went into the forest and began to kill the lions. By mid-day not 
a lion was to be seen in the forest. He brought their fat to the 
king. 
The said’ said, “Send him to fight against the king, Mouro 
Gigante. He has many soldiers, they will kill him.” He got a 
letter from the king telling him to go to Mouro Gigante to collect 
a debt or to bring his head. He went, he declared war, by noon 
not a soldier was left standing. 
The said’ said, “Send him against Re’ de Mouro Grande to bring 
the thirteen millions this king is owing or his head.” When the 
boy was about to start, he divined he might die. He asked for a 
barber and a leech (sangredor) to go with him. He said to his 
mother, “I am going, I may die. They will kill you too. When 
they come after you, ask them for a quarter of an hour. Go into 
a room by yourself and take off your clothes. As you take off 
each piece, call my name. At the last piece I will help you, dead 
or alive.” 
He went, he declared war. Four million soldiers he killed, four 
hundred thousand he spared. ‘‘Call the king,” he said. This 
king slept six months, and staid awake six months. That day 
was the day he began to sleep. They lowered a gun and dis- 
charged it at his ear. He said, “Pshaw! Fly, let me sleep!” 
They told Jon the king was asleep and that they must wait for 
him to awake. On the top of the king’s head were a cowherd and 
his herd. Inside his ear was a house for an elephant to sleep in. 
Jon de Mon Stofilan shook the king and woke him up. “I feel 
the weight of a hand I never felt before,” said the king. He 
called for eighty thousand men to bring his shoes. There was 
not that number, so he got his shoes himself. He called for fifty 
thousand to bring him his clothes. There was not that number, 
so he got his clothes himself. He called for forty thousand to 
bring him his pipe. He filled his pipe, he puffed, the forty 
thousand disappeared from sight. He went to the stable, he 
jumped on a horse, the horse broke in the middle. Jon de Mon 
Stofilan said, “I am going to cut off your legs.” He cut them off.
-P-A-G-E-371
344 : Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society. 
“T am going to cut off your arms.” He cut them off. A shepherd 
said, “‘Compadre, the world is shaking.” When the king’s sword 
fell, Jon picked it up and put it for him in his mouth. He fought 
on with the sword in his mouth. “I am going to cut off your 
head.” The elephant in the king’s ear ran out to escape. The 
elephant knocked down Jon’s horse, Jon fell. He called for the 
leech. “Come and finish me!”—“I am here only to bleed you.” 
He called for the barber. ‘Come and finish me!”—‘‘I am here, 
not to kill you, but to shave you.” 
They sent word to the king to kill his mother, so she would 
never again bear another such son. His mother called his name 
by her clothes. He woke up, he saw in front of him a mountain. 
He thought it was the head of Re’ de MouroGrande. He cut it in 
two, making it into a plain. He went home, he found only his 
mother alive. The others in the city had died of shock. 
117. THE GRATEFUL SPIRIT.1 
T have a story to tell in the month of January. There were a 
king and a queen who had a daughter. There was a poor couple 
who had a son. The poor man was a skilled carpenter. He 
worked in the king’s house. The king’s daughter was eighteen 
years old. The poor man’s son was fifteen. The man took his 
son with him every day to learn his trade. He was a handsome 
boy, the king’s daughter was pleased with him. One day she 
told her mother she would like to marry him. The queen said, 
“Wait, talk with your father the king.” She told her father. 
He said, “If you like him enough to marry him, it is for you to 
say. If you don’t like him enough, it is for you to say, too. I 
will do what I can to please you.” The boy wrote a letter to his 
father, saying that the king’s daughter wanted to marry him. 
The father thought it was impossible for a poor man’s son to 
marry a king’s daughter. ‘There is no difficulty,” said the boy, 
“because she likes me.” The father consented. “Maybe your 
happiness is in this.” Then the king’s daughter married the son 
of this poor man.?

After the marriage his father asked the boy what he wanted. 
He answered, “A little vessel.” The king’s daughter had a child. 
She wanted her named for her mother, the father wanted her named 
forhismother. They agreed to name her for.her mother’s mother. 
He loaded his boat with freight, he took on a crew, he set sail. 
The wind was fair, they sailed forty odd days out of sight of land. 
On the fiftieth day they sighted land. They cast anchor. Jon 
de Scalais took his wife and child ashore. They lodged at a 
prince’s house. They ate and went out. On their way they met 
people dragging a corpse to burn. Jon de Scalais asked, “Why 
don’t you bury this body?”-—“ This is the custom of the country. 
We have no place to bury people. We burn every one who dies.” 
He said, “‘Will you give me the corpse to bury, that being the 
custom of my country?”——‘‘The matter is in your hands. Bury 
it if you like. We cannot, because we are following the order of 
the governor.” Jon de Scalais took the body, he buried it,! then 
he returned to the house of the prince. 
The prince told Jon de Scalais he wanted to make a voyage on 
his vessel. Jon de Scalais agreed. The prince wanted to go 
because Jon’s wife, as he saw, was a princess, and the most beauti- 
ful woman he had ever seen. His own wife he fooled, saying he 
was merely visiting on board. Jon de Scalais ordered the anchor 
up. They sailed four hundred miles from shore. The prince 
called Jon de Scalais into the bow. It was bad weather. He 
said he wanted to hear him give his orders to the sailors. [Jon] 
said he didn’t need to give orders, all his sailors knew what to do. 
The prince insisted. To humor him, Jon went into the bow to 
give orders. One sailor he ordered to take in sail, one to go aloft. 
The prince pushed him overboard. At this moment his wife in 
the vessel is on the high seas. The sailor is set adrift in a little boat with a barrel of 
biscuits and a barrel of water. In three days he makes land where there is a solitary 
house. Seven robbers live there, and an old woman to cook for them. He has buried his 
money. The robbers say who steals the most shall be captain. He digs up his money to 
show how well he can steal, and they make him captain. They give-him the keys of the 
house, saying he may open all the seven rooms but one. In the seventh room is a prin- 
cess they have stolen from her bath in her father’s garden. They are keeping her locked 
up until they get six more princesses, so that each can have a wife. .. . The old woman is 
splitting wood, He says to her, “I will split it for you. Take hold of the end to steady

it a sentason (a mild kind of a devil), they escape, as in the foregoing variant. (Boa Vista.) 
1 Variants: @ In the churchyard they see people dragging a corpse by a rope around 
the neck. It is the custom of the country, they say, when a man dies in debt, to drag his 
corpse through the street. He gives the dead man’s family one thousand dollars to pay 
op. ais debts. (Fogo.) — (2) At each door the debtor’s corpse is given a blow. (Boa

the cabin called to her husband. The prince said Jon de Scalais 
was in the bow giving orders. He told the sailors not to tell her 
Jon was overboard. She cried for him. They knew he was 
dead, but they shunned telling her. 
When Jon fell overboard, the spirit of the dead man [the corpse 
he had buried] took him up, he took him to the shore and put him 
in acave. Then he said, “Jon, know you who is with you?”— 
“No.” —“You remember the-body you buried?”—Yes.” The 
spirit went digging clams and catching crabs to feed Jon. On 
that beach he lived seven years and one day. 
(I now return to Jon’s wife.) The prince took command of 
the vessel. He consoled the princess so well, she thought no more 
about her husband. When they made the country of Jon de 
Scalais, the prince hoisted the black flag and the quarantine flag. 
The captain of the port went aboard to learn the trouble. The 
prince told the story. The princess went home and held the 
service for her husband. After thirty days the prince told the 
king he wanted to marry Jon’s wife. The king said she was of 
age and must speak for herself. She said, “‘No, I am not sure yet 
that my husband is dead.” He insisted. Finally she gave him 
her word to marry him. She told her father she was going to 
marry the prince, but it was not much to her liking. Her father 
said, ‘“Do as you please. Woman without man is nothing, man 
without woman is nothing.” They set the date for the following day. 
At this time the spirit said, “Jon, your wife is to be married 
to-morrow. But have patience, God is with you. Jon, if I put 
you to-morrow by your wife, what will you pay me?”—“It is 
hopeless. How in the world could you put me by my wife?”— 
“Lay your head in my lap.” The spirit began to scratch his 
head. He went to sleep. He woke up in the kitchen of his wife. 
He had been away seven years and one day. His whiskers were 
down to his waist, his hair over his shoulders, his nails long. He 
looked like a devil (dimonio). At four o’clock the servant went 
to the kitchen to heat water for a bath for the princess. She 
made a light, she saw the man there. “Who are you?”—“T am 
Jon de Scalais.” The servant told the princess there was a man

in the kitchen who said he was Jon de Scalais. The princess said, 
“My husband has been dead seven years and one day. He died 
off Praia Grande.” The servant returned to the kitchen, and 
said to Jon his wife did not believe it was he. “‘Here is the ring 
of my wife with her initials. Take it to her.” The princess came 
to the kitchen, she saw for herself that it was her husband. It 
was five in the morning. She took him to her room. She shaved 
him, she cut his hair, she trimmed his nails, she gave him a bath, 
she gave him clothes. She left him playing on her bed with his 
little daughter; she went to tell her father that Jon de Scalais 
had come back into the world, and to convince him she showed 
him the ring. The king came and saw Jon for himself. The 
princess said to keep his return to themselves. The spirit was 
always around Jon de Scalais, but he did not see him. 
At ten that morning was the hour set for the marriage of the 
princess. The prince went to see the king. He went into the 
powder-house to see how much powder they had for the wedding. 
They were to have a big fusilade (fuson). The king pushed the 
prince into the powder-house, he pulled the door to, he scratched a 
match, he threw it in and shut the door. Before they knew it, 
the smoke from the prince was in the sky. The king told the 
princess to be quiet about it, they would turn the wedding-feast 
into a feast to welcome Jon de Scalais.! 
The spirit said, “I leave you now. I go.” Jon said, “God go 
with you!”—“Jon, do you remember the promise you made me?” 
He had almost forgotten. Then he remembered he had promised 
the spirit half of the fruit of his wife. He took a sword, his child 
he held by one leg, he gave the other leg to the spirit. The spirit 
stopped him. “Jon, do you and your wife enjoy her fruit, be- 
cause I am not of this world. I go to God. You and your wife 
remain here.? Live a new life, a lifenew. ‘

118. DIVIDING THE CHILD.) 
There were two sisters. They lived together in one house. 
Both were pregnant at the same time. They gave birth on the 
same day. Five months fater one lost her child. She had large 
breasts. She rolled over on the child and smothered it. Both 
women and both children were sleeping in the same bed. During 
the night she found her child was dead. Both children looked 
much alike. The woman put her dead child in the place of the 
living child. Next morning the other woman found the dead 
child. She said, “This is your child, not mine.”—‘‘No, this one 
by me is mine. Yours is dead.” There was nobody to settle 
this big question between the two. They went to a judge. The 
judge did not know what to say. He called to a soldier to bring 
him his sword. He said he would split the child in two, and give 
half toeach woman. The mother of the child said, “No, Sir Judge, 
don’t split the child! Give it to her!” She who was not the 
mother said, “Yes, Sir Judge, split the child!” The judge gave 
his sentence. “This is the mother of the child.” The other 
woman was disgraced. That is the end of this story. 
11g. THE LOST RING? 
There was a king had a son. He sent him to school. He told 
him not to open the last page of his book. He opened the page, 
and there he saw the picture of Mangalona, daughter of Don Re’ 
Sonegal. He refused to eat or drink until he saw her face. 
“What is it you want?” asked his father. ‘‘A full-rigged ship.” 
He sailed for three months, he reached the country of Mangalona. 
He married her. 
After they were married, they went to the shore and went in 
bathing. She had a ring of remembrance from her father. While 
the prince was looking at it, it dropped, a didéo [a species of fish] 
soul. The man takes the child by one arm, and gives the other to the soul, He takes 
his sword to split the child in two. “No,” says the soul, “I was only testing you. All 
I want is for you to pray for me.” (Fogo.) — (4) When the son is three years old, the soul 
comes to collect his debt. The father gives the soul the sword to split the child. “No, 
you, his father, must split him.” . . . “You all stay here,” says the soul, “I will go to my 
redemption.” (Boa Vista.)

got it. She said, “Recover it for me, because it is a remembrance 
from my father.” He said, “Let us go home! There I have a 
much finer ring for you.” But she insisted on his finding it, He 
went into the water after the fish. He sang,— 
“Scratch [the ground], scratch [the ground]! 
See! that is a ring, 
Put it down where I can find it.” 
The fish swam on. The prince went, went, went. He stuck in 
the mud. 
She had on a silk dress. She changed it for a dress for gather- 
ing nuts (cimente)1 She returned to her father’s place, and be- 
came a doctor for curing people (doutor de cur’ pév’). 
The prince was lost so long, he became wild (érav’). He went, 
went, went, until he came to Mangalona’s country. He was sick. 
They took him to her to cure. A servant of Mangalona saw him 
and recognized him. She asked Mangalona if she knew him. 
“No,” said Mangalona. She shaved ‘him, she cut his hair, she 
bathed him. He was even handsomer than before.? She called 
to her father, “Sir Prince has come!” —‘‘You pelingrinha mama 
de banan’,s shut up, or I will slap you!” But when the king and 
queen saw him, they fainted. They gave a dance and a feast for 
four months to celebrate the marriage.. 
120. DIVIDING THE CHEESE.’ 
Two cats stole a cheese. One wanted to divide it. The other 
was distrustful; he said, “No, let us get a monkey to divide!” 
The cat went to the monkey, he asked him to be the judge. “Yes, 
with pleasure,” answered the monkey. He sent them for a scale. 
He took a knife. Instead of cutting the cheese in halves, he made 
one piece larger than the other. He put them in the scale. He 
said, “I didn’t divide this well.”’ The heavier side he started to 
eat. “What are you doing?”—“I am going to eat on this piece 
to make it even with the other.” As he ate, it became lighter than 
the other piece. He changed over, and began to eat the other to 
even it up. The cats saw that the monkey intended to eat all

the cheese. They said, “Sir Judge, let us have the balance of the 
cheese, and we will divide it ourselves.” —‘No, a fight might arise 
between you, then the king of the animals would come after me.” 
He went on eating, first on one side, then on the other. They saw 
that nothing would be left. One cat turned to the other, and said, 
“Tt had been better for us to have divided our cheese ourselves.” 
After the monkey had eaten it all, he said, “Let us all go in peace, 
and never again let your interest blind your understanding.” 
12I. THE THREE CEDRATS,! 
There was a man had a son named Mané. He wasrich. One 
day a Negress passed by with an egg-shell, picking up popped 
beans (gueren). The boy said, “You should not do that.” She 
answered, ‘‘The curse (praga) I ask from Jesus Christ is that you 
fall asleep and dream of three cedrats in mid-ocean. One you 
will enjoy, two you will not enjoy.” 
That night he dreamed of three cedrats. In the morning he 
asked his father for a full-rigged ship. He sailed three months 
before he found the cedrats. He sailed on a sea the color of milk. 
He split open a cedrat. Out came a woman. She said, “Sir, 
give me a drink of water, or I die!”” He had no water to give her. 
She dropped dead. He threw her body overboard. He sailed 
on a sea the color of St. John’s sun. He split a cedrat, out came 
a woman. She said, ‘Sir, give me a drink of water, or I die!” 
He had. no water to give her. She dropped dead. “The third 
cedrat I will not split,” said he, “until I reach home.” He ar- 
rived home, he reached his father’s well, he got water in his 
Madeira hat (chapé de Madeir’). He split the cedrat. Out came 
awoman. “Sir, give me a drink of water, or I die!” He gave 
her water from his hat. 
There was a polon-tree by the well. He put her in the top of 
it. Her hair fell down and protected her from the sun. He went 
-home. His father had a servant. When she came to the well, 
she saw the reflection in the water. She said, “Madires, how 
pretty you are! yet you carry a pot for others.” She broke the pot 
and went home. They slapped her four times, they gave her an 
iron gourd to fetch water in. She returned to the well. She 
saw the reflection; she said, ‘‘Madires, how pretty you are! yet

you carry a gourd for others.” She struck the gourd on a stone, 
it hit her on the forehead. She fell, the woman in the polon 
laughed. She looked up, she saw her; she said, ““O Senh’a! throw 
me down your hair, so I can climb up and entertain you.” Up in 
the tree she passed her hand over the woman’s head, into her head 
she stuck a pin. The woman turned into a dove and flew away. 
Madires staid up in the polon. The following day Mané was 
toreturn. Madires had seven grains of hair on her head. “You 
are not going to marry this woman, are you?” asked Mané’s 
father. “Yes.” The father had a superintendent (hortes) of his 
grounds (horta). Next day a dove flew by him, and said, “Good- 
day, Mr. Superintendent!”——‘‘Good-day, Mistress Little-Dove!” 
—“How are Sir King and Lady Queen, Sir Prince and the lady 
sweetheart (Sehnora Amorada)?”—‘‘They are eating and drink- 
ing and arguing and consoling.” 
The superintendent told the king that for two days the dove 
had flown by, asking about everybody. The king gave him a 
barrel of tar to catch the dove. The next morning she said, 
“Good-day, Mr. Superintendent!” —“Good-day, Mistress Little- 
Dove.” As she started to fly, her feet stuck in the tar. He 
took her to the king. ‘‘The dove belongs to me,” said the king. 
“The dove belongs to me,” said the queen. “The dove belongs 
to me,” said Mané. As he felt the dove’s head, he noticed the 
pin, he drew it out. She changed into a beautiful woman. 
The father published their marriage with eight priests, he 
martied them with sixteen. At the wedding reception (se de 
noiv’) there were thirty-two priests. They sent for forty-five 
big bundles of wood. Twenty bundles they laid down. They 
put Madires on top of them, and on top of her twenty-five bundles. 
They poured on oil and burned her to death. 
San Anton does not give corn. He does not give beans. They plant 
corn, up comes éa/ou (a rank grass). They plant beans, up comes figon 
(a poor variety of bean). 
122, THE MAGIC sworp! 
There was a man from Fogo married to a woman from Cab’ 
Verde. They were well-to-do people. There was a well where 
they got water. Inside the well was a dragon (diche). They had

to throw a child or an animal into the well to get water. (While the 
dragon was eating it, they had time to get water.) The couple 
had many servants; and whenever they wanted water, they 
would throw one into the well. After a while all their servants 
were done away with. The woman had to go herself for water. 
She went to the well, she sat down, she wondered what to do. 
She was pregnant! The child spoke to her. ‘“Moisten your 
little finger in your mouth, strike it on a stone thrice, walk thrice 
around the well. Then I will get you water.”2 After she had 
struck the stone thrice and walked thrice around the well, the 
child was born. It was born wearing soldiers’ clothes and a 
sword. The name on the sword was “Cabrina Flor, the woman 
who spits once-a year; there grows a flower, even a flower of love.” 
He had but to call this name for the sword to jump out. With 
the sword he cut off the head of the dragon. They got water, 
they went home. : 
They lived on his, mother’s island. He told his mother he was 
going to visit his father’s island. There he asked his father for 
his blessing. His father said, “I cannot bless you, you are not a 
Christian.” —“T am a Christian.” —“If you have been christened, 
what is your name?”—“Prince Saboia, Duke of Alulia, Count 
Martinho Marculado.”—‘‘What is your godmother’s name?” — 
“My godmother’s name is ‘Cabrina Flor, the woman who spits 
once a year; there grows a flower, even the flower of love.’” Out 
jumped his sword (whenever he uttered the name, out it jumped). 
“What is your godfather’s name?”—‘King of Ciboa. When 
he strikes a stone with his sword, the splinter falls at Chixa 
Margura. Besides, I have a brother named Martinho Cabac di 
+ Variant: A pregnant woman goes out for water. She meets a man dressed in banana- 
leaves. She asks him to help her put her da/de on her head. “I feel like giving you a 
couple of slaps; but since you are pregnant, I will let you go.” She meets another man 
dressed in path’ di jordi. She asks him to help her up with her dalde. “‘You see I am 
dressed in palh’ di jordi. I feel like giving you a couple of slaps; but since you are preg- 
nant, I will let you go.” She meets a third man. He is dressed in corn-shucks (palh’ di 
milho). “You think I am going to help you and soil my clothes! I feel like giving youa 
couple of slaps; but since you are pregnant, I will let you go.” (Cab’ Verde.) 
2 Variant: The woman sees none to help her. She hears a voice within saying, “‘Bear 
me now, and I will help you.” She answers, “The time has not come for you to come 
out.” —“My time has come. Jump this brook thrice. Rub a piece of grass behind your knee. Kneel down, and I will come.” ...He asks at once for her blessing. “I can’t bless you, you are not yet christened.”—“I am christened, my name is Jonsinho di Man- tam. My godmother is “Sword of Cabrina, Flower of Love; when my woman desires me, dry turns pregnant [G. T. S. thought this word should be, not prenha (“pregnant”), but parida (“giving milk”)], and pregnant turns dry.’” The sword goes to his mother, she faints from fear. The blessing and sword episode is repeated in connection with his father on their return to the house. (Cab’ Verde.)

Cococo.” His father shook him by the hand. He returned to 
the island of his mother. 
Three or four months later the news came that the king’s 
daughter had been stolen and taken to the Island of Morango. 
The seven companies the king sent to rescue his daughter did not 
return. The king heard about Prince Saboia, he sent for him. 
He went. ‘‘What is this?” said the king, “I shought I was send- 
ing for a man, they send me a boy!” The boy got angry. He 
said to his sword, “This is the time to save me.” Out jumped the 
sword, and pursued the king. The boy called it back into the 
scabbard. The king shook hands, and offered him all he wanted. 
“T sent for you to go to Morango to rescue my daughter.”—“I 
will go, but first I must see my mother and my godmother and 
godfather.” He visited his godmother, he asked for her blessing. 
“No,” said she, “there is no use of your going to Morango. The 
famous men sent there never return.” He started to break down 
the house. Then his godmother gave him her blessing, and 
he restored what he had broken. He gave her the money he had 
received from the king. He visited his mother. She said, “I 
shall not advise you. You had better see your father. I am a 
woman, and so without much to say.” He went to Fogo, he told 
his father of his mission. “Go! Even if you never return, you 
will be famous. Light of the Holy Ghost [spirito sant’) go with 
you!” He returned to his island, he took farewell of his mother. 
The king had soldiers ready to go with him. He declined them. 
“All I want are a boat and captain and crew and one servant.’ ? 
1 Variant: The boy asks his father for a horse, saying that a mare has just been de- 
livered of a foal....He rides up and down before the king’s door. The fifth time the 
king has his soldiers stop him. . . . He asks the king for a ship, a captain, one sailor, a dog, 
and a cat to gowith him to the country of the Great Moor (MouroGrande). (Cab’ Verde.) 
2 Voriant: He sails for thirty-six days. He lands. The old woman he meets offers to 
hide him. “I didn’t come here to hide. Icame here to fight. Show me the bell they 
ting for war.”— “Because you are alone, ring it but once. Were you to ring it four times, 
all the people of the city would gather.” He rings four times. All the Moorish (Mouro) 
soldiers come up. For three days he kills, kills, kills. His horse kills. The sun dries up 
the blood. He digs his horse out with his sword. The one hundred and twenty survivors 
run to the Great Moor (Mouro Grande) and run up his nose. The Great Moor sleeps six 
months, and eats and drinks six months. He is now sleeping. Jon shoots off ten cannon 
to arouse him. He sends for twenty oxen to cook with manioc and eat, and fifty hogs- 
heads (pipas) to drink. He asks Jon to help him on with his hat. “Without my hat I 
should fall over backwards.” On his hat are seven sugar-presses (tripixe), seven cobii, 
seven lambri. “Now help me with my horse.”——“‘I will. I am patient, because I am 
going to kill you.”——“‘Now help me with my coat.” His coat is of steel... . Jon cuts off 
the sugar-presses one by one. The Great Moor falls over, because without his hat he can- 
not stand upright. He asks Jon his name. Out leaps the sword and goes for the Great 
Moor. He faints. Jon asks him to deliver over the princess. He refuses. Jon cus off 
his head. Out come the hundred and twenty men from his nose. {Cab’ Verde.)

They sailed for a month and fifteen days. The vessel docked, 
he went ashore. He passed by a grindstone where an old woman 
sat. ‘‘For what is this grindstone?” —‘‘To sharpen weapons for 
war.” He sharpened his sword. He passed by a big bell (sin’) 
where an old woman sat. “For what is this bell?”—‘‘To give 
the signal for war.” Near by was a church full of people. “Why 
are they at church?” he asked the old woman. “It is the feast 
day of San Anton.” He went into the church. He saw the girl 
who was to be his wife. They fell in love at first sight. She sent 
a messenger to ask his name. He sent a messenger to ask her 
name. Her name was “Fumosa Dona Maria, fumosa di dia, 
fumosa di noite, fumosa di quanta héra, Sol poigna, Lua crisa, 
*Strella alba.” He said his name was “Prince Saboia, Duke 
of Alulia, Count Martinho Marculado.” His godmother’s name 
was ‘“Cabrina Flor, the woman who spits once a year; there 
grows a flower, even the flower of love.” Out jumped the sword 
to encircle the church. ‘‘No harm is meant,” he told the people, 
and he recalled the sword. When he went to speak to the girl, 
she said, “Don’t speak to me here! I am betrothed to one who 
would kill us. Come to my house.” As he rode to the house, 
he met the girl’s mother. He pulled in his horse, it reared. The 
girl’s mother dropped on her knees; she prayed, “Mercy, sir! 
[Misi corde, Senhor!|”—‘Do not pray to me! I am a creature 
like yourself. I come to ask you to give me your daughter in 
marriage.” —“T cannot give you an answer. She is betrothed.” — 
“T will fight the man. Let the winner marry her.” He went to 
the priest to delay the marriage until he returned. 
He went on to the Island of Morango. In one month he 
arrived. He landed. He passed by a grindstone where sat an 
old woman. ‘“‘For what is this grindstone?”—‘To sharpen 
weapons for war.” He sharpened his sword. He sent the old 
woman on shipboard. He passed by a bell where sat an old 
woman. “For what is this bell?” —‘‘To give the signal for war.” 
He rang the bell. ‘The more you ring, the greater the number of 
the Moors [Mouros] who will come,” said the old woman. “That 
is just what I want. I can’t have enough people.” They lived 
in holes under the ground. He went through them, he killed 
them with his sword. He killed four thousand. He fought for 
three months. The flood of blood drove him into a pit. The 
blood congealed and held him tight. The Moors beset him. He

called on his sword, “This is the time for you to save me!” Out 
jumped the sword, and for three months and a half it slaughtered 
the people. Then it returned to the scabbard. He waved his 
handkerchief to his vessel. They came, and with shovel and pick 
dug him out, they took him on board. 
There the old woman said, “You are doing well, but you have 
more still to do. When you go ashore, you will encounter a 
dragon [4icha]. If it lies mouth open and tongue out, it is asleep; - 
if its eyes are open, it is awake.” He went ashore, he found a 
dragon with its mouth open. He shoved his hand into its mouth, 
he pulled out its vitals. What he pulled out turned into a dove. 
The dove started to fly away. He called on his sword to bring 
back the dove. When he split open the dove, out flew a bluejay. 
He called on the sword to bring back the bluejay. He split it 
open, he took out an egg. He broke the egg, he found in it a gold 
key. The key opened the last door of the seven doors shut on 
the princess. He took the princess to his vessel. 
On his way he stopped for the girl he wanted to marry. That 
very day she was to be married. The people at her house told 
him she was on the way to the church. Her bridegroom was blind 
of one eye. On his blind side walked the bride; on the other side, 
a Negress. The prince put the Negress in the place of the bride, 
and the bride he carried away to the ship. He set sail for the 
king’s country, and in one month and a half he arrived. 
In the palace the king had one chair of gold, and two chairs 
of silver. The gold chair he offered his daughter, the silver chair 
he offered the prince and his bride. The prince was indignant, 
he refused to sit. He went to his mother’s house. He said to 
his mother, “TI will kill the king.” His mother objected; he 
insisted. The palace was at a distance. The prince said, “The 
only way for him to save himself will be to creep on hands and 
knees from the palace to your door.” He published this in a paper. 
The king began to creep, he crept for three years. When he 
arrived, he asked for pardon. The prince raised the king up from 
1 Variant: Jon finds a book telling him where the princess is hidden. She is locked up 
with seven keys, and the keys are in the belly of a wild dragon (ichafeira). If the dragon 
has its eyes open, it is asleep; if they are shut, it is awake. He finds the dragon with eyes 
open. He runs his hand down its throat and pulls out the keys. The seventh unlocks the 
door of the princess. ‘Creature [Creatura], what are you doing here? Seven years [have 
been here and seen nobody.” .. . She tells him to cut off the seven heads of the dragon. 
She promises to marry him. (Cab’ Verde.)

they were much enjoying? 
Shoes run down the brook, up the brook. Who knows more had

123. THE SINGING INFANT.? 
There were a man and woman married, with three children. 
She had a garden she valued as much as a child. The man was a 
carpenter. He worked in the king’s house. The king had a 
daughter named Solitana.. She looked like the carpenter’s wife, 
Hortensia. One day Solitana told the carpenter she wanted to 
marry him. “No,” said the carpenter, “you know very well I am 
married and have three children.”—“‘Unless you marry me, I 
will ask my father to cut off your head. He is a king, and what 
he orders must be.” The carpenter was disgusted, he left his 
work. 
~ The princess had a pain in her stomach. None of the doctors 
of Europe could cure her. One day she told her father that the 
only thing to cure her was the liver of Hortensia. The carpenter 
was working on the verandah. . The servant told him. Usually 
on his return home he was light-hearted. This day he did not 
play with his children. His wife noticed it. She went into the 
garden. She sang and said,— 
“Ai, ai, my garden! 
Ai, ai, my garden! 
I come to water you with bitter water, 
For to-morrow you will have another to water you.” 
1 Variant: The king gives his daughter the gold chair, and Jon the silver chair. He 
threatens to kill the king. The king sends for Jon’s parents. ‘For the sake of the 
blessing we gave you, don’t kill the king!”—“I won’t kill him, but I will leave him almost 
dead. He must follow me on his knees over the Island of Cab’ Verde.” After thus 
following Jon, the king’s knees are sore. All the people weep over him. God found it just 
that from the king’s knees the curse should pass to a goat. To this day a goat has cal- 
loused knees (Deus achou just’ para o doelho do rei passou maldisa a cabra que até hoje 
cabra tem o doelho sec’). (Cab’ Verde.) 
2 Variant: The next day they are married, There is a feast for all the people and for 
all the animals, The joy we have to-day is a bit of that festal joy in the house of the king.

The day following, the man went to work again. Again the 
servant met him, and said the princess had been crying all night 
to kill his wife and marry him herself. On his return home he 
spoke to none, for he had agreed to kill his wife. The princess 
was recovered, for she expected to marry him. Hortensia turned 
to her youngest child (coude) (it was two months old); she said,— 
“Farewell, my youngest, ai! 
Farewell, my youngest, ai!

The princess was sitting on the verandah; she was playing her 
viola and looking forward to killing the woman that day and to 
marrying the day following. The youngest child sang to its 
mother,—

The princess fell off the verandah and broke her neck. They had 
to pick up the pieces of her with a fork. When the carpenter 
went home, he felt more cheerful. He played with the youngest 
child, he told his wife the whole story. “I knew it all from the 
beginning,” said she. : 
They lived a new life, a life new.

There were a wolf and a fox. They came across a lamb. 
They killed it, they ate a part of it. Wolf said to Fox, “What 
shall we do with the rest?”—“Bury it.”—‘‘We sha’n’t be able 
to smell it. How shall we find it?”—‘‘Leave out the tail.” The 
following day Wolf asked Fox, “Are we not going to eat the rest 
of that meat?”—‘Not to-day. To-day I am to be godmother to 
alittle dog.” The following day Wolf said, “What name did you 
give the baby?”—“Feast [Comes].”—“Are we not going to eat 
the rest of that meat to-day?”—‘‘No, not to-day. To-day Iam 
going to be godmother.” The following day Wolf said, “What 
name did you give the baby?” —“‘Half [M?’].”—“ Are we not going 
to eat the rest of that meat?”-—“Not to-day. To-day I am going

to be godmother to a little cat.” The following day Wolf asked, 
“What name did you give the baby?”—“Finished [4cadé].”— 
“Are we not going to eat the rest of that meat?”—“‘Yes.” They 
went to where the tail was. Wolf said, ‘Who pulls it out?”— 
“O Wolf! you pull it out, you are the stronger.” Wolf seized the 
tail, he pulled. The tail came out, he fell on his back, his legs in 
the air. Away ran Fox. 
125. THE UNFILIAL Son.) 
There was a woman had two sons. They were both married. 
One was named Manuel; one, Anton. She lived with Manuel. 
He was better off than Anton. Anton had nothing to eat. He 
stole a cow from his mother. When the cow disappeared, they 
were satisfied he had killed it, but they did not want to call him a 
thief. 
Manuel acted as if he was angry with his wife. Then he put 
his mother in a trunk. He took the trunk to his brother’s house, 
he said he was moving away from his wife. Anton took the cow to 
cook. He had many children. One cried for one bone, one for 
another. One said, “I want a bone from the cow of my grand- 
mother.” She said from the trunk, “This is just what I wanted 
to know.” He said, “Since I had to steal from somebody, it was 
better to steal from my mother.” He told his mother to get out 
of the trunk — that was no way to act. He lifted the lid. She 
started to get out. He shut the lid down on her neck and killed 
her. He threw her back into the trunk. 
The next day Manuel came for the trunk, he said he had made 
peace with his wife. He put the trunk on his head. After he 
had gone a little way, he said, “Mother, did you learn anything?” 
There was no answer. He opened the trunk, he found his mother 
done for (sec’). When he reached home, he lay the body on the 
bed and began to weep. He sent for his brother Anton to go with 
him to bury their mother. Anton said, “‘I will go to the funeral, 
but I have no money to pay towards its expense.” They arranged 
the casket (cochon), then they buried her. 
Anton dug up the grave, he took the clothes off the body, he 
stood the body by Manuel’s door. Manuel opened the door, the 
body fell down on to the middle of the floor. Manuel told Anton 
that their mother had returned. Anton said, “You know our

mother had a lot of money. You buried her stingily, you put 
no money with her. She has come back for it. Put money and 
jewels in the casket and bury her again.” That night Anton 
went and dug up the money and jewels, he stood the body again 
by Manuel’s door. ‘Mother has -returned,” said Manuel to 
Anton. “You did not put enough in with her, that is why she 
has returned. I will go with you and fix it so she won’t return.” 
He helped Manuel to put more things in the casket, and to bury 
her again. She did not return. 
Manuel found Anton had more goods than he. Every child he 
had he gave him as godfather. Last week I passed by there. I 
had two drinks (car) and a leg of chicken. They send their love 
to you all. 
126 THE MAGIC SHIP: THE THREE TEMPTRESSES. 
There was a king with three sons. The second son was dumb. 
He sent him to school to read and write. He gave his answers in 
writing. When the eldest was eighteen, he asked his father to let 
him go out into the world. Then the youngest son (coude) asked 
togo. The dumb son was angry because the youngest was let go. 
He was the second son, he should go before the youngest. ‘‘True,” 
said his father, “but I withheld my permission from you because 
you were dumb.” He said, “‘I have eyes and a mind. I can’t 
speak, but I can enjoy life as well as another.”—‘‘Wait two 
months,” said his father. Then he built him a ship to sail through 
the world. 
He wrote a note to the captain to set sail for Australia. Thirty 
days out they lost a sailor. Prince Dumb (Mudo) they did not 
tell, so as not to worry him. The next night they lost another 
sailor. This time they told the prince. He sharpened his sword. 
He sent them all below, he would stand watch alone. The cap- 
tain objected. He said, “You are all of you of my family. I will 
protect you. To-night I watch alone.” . At midnight he saw an 
arm seizing the boat. He cut it off, the arm fell into the boat. 
The following morning they sighted a ship. It was a magic ship. 
The people in it asked why they had cut off the arm. The prince 
wrote a note, he gave it to the captain to send to the captain of the 
magic ship, but his captain tore up the note. He wrote another 
note to his captain, asking why he-had not told that it was he

{the prince] who had cut off the arm. “I was afraid,” said the 
captain. 
At nine the next day the two ships were to fight it out. Mean- 
while the strange ship disappeared to the bottom of the sea. 
The captain gave his crew something to give them courage. 
They got drunk, they became speechless. Prince Dumb asked 
God to give him a tongue to speak with. He found his tongue, 
he called upon his captain and his crew to help. When they 
heard him speak, they gathered themselves together; for they 
knew God was with them, because he had loosed his tongue. On 
the enchanted ship was a revolving gun. The enchanted ship 
fired and cut the flag-pole. The prince fired and cut down the 
two masts and the rigging. The prince told the sailors of that 
ship he wanted to spare them. The captain said he would take 
them all under the water. Only the prince agreed to go with him. 
He promised the prince to bring him up in three days. 
They submerged. They went to a city under the water. The 
captain was aking. He treated the prince like a son. He wanted 
to sleep in his room. ‘“‘No, I never sleep with any one,” said the 
prince. When the prince looked at the servant sent to make 
ready his room, she shook her head. ‘Why do you shake your 
head?” asked the prince. She said, “The king’s daughter will 
come in to see you. If you talk with her, you will be turned into 
a marble stone.” That night the king’s daughter came in, but he 
would not talk with her. The next morning the king asked him 
how he fared. He said, ‘‘I had a bad night. A witch bothered 
me and kept me from sleeping.” His day was pleasant. But 
the same servant told him that that night another woman even 
more beautiful than the first would visit him. If he talked with 
her, he would be turned into a marble stone. That night the 
second daughter of the king came in, but he would not talk with 
her. The next day the king asked him how he fared. “I had a 
bad night. A witch bothered me even more than the night. 
before, and kept me from sleeping.” The servant told him the 
next night the third daughter would come. She said, “Don’t 
speak with her until midnight! To-morrow the king will have 
to take you back.? He will offer you three roses of different size.

daughter will come at night to play with him. He is not to notice her, on penalty of being 
turned to stone.... Of the youngest daughter the old woman warns him in particular. 
“She is wiser than the other two. She will give you a more trying time.” (Fogo.)

Take the smallest.” When the prince took the smallest, the king 
asked, “Why do you take the smallest?” —“That I may put it in 
my pocket.”! The prince took leave. 
Three hours later he put his hand in his pocket and touched his 
box. The box said, “‘Do not speak to me in the day-time. I 
must never see the sun.”” At night he and the box talked together. 
It took him thirty-five days to reach home. In port the box 
said, ““Do not speak to me in the day-time. Keep me in your 
pocket. Three days after you land I shall become a woman.” 
His father wrote him a note asking about his voyage. He kissed 
his father’s hand, and he spoke. ‘“‘Who is the doctor who cured 
you?” asked his father. ‘I will send him a million dollars.’— 
“No human doctor. It was God who gave me my speech.” 
When the prince went to his own room, a friend went with him. 
He asked the friend to leave him, as he was tired. The friend 
looked through the window and saw the prince knock the box on 
the bed, and turn it into a woman. - She ran to tell the queen, she 
said she had never seen such a beautiful face. The queen told 
her to hidé under the bed and steal the box. She hid, she stole 
the box, she carried it to the queen. The queen threw it into the 
fire. The box turned to smoke, and the smoke blew into the room 
of the prince. She told him that the day following, at nine, her 
people were coming in the clouds to get her. The prince was 
greatly upset. He and she went to his mother. The queen 
knelt to her as if to a saint. She raised the queen up; she said, 
“Tam a human being, like you. I was to have married the prince; 
but now, since the box is burned, I must return to my people.” 
The king entered. He knelt to her too. She raised him up. He 
ordered the woman who had stolen the box to be thrown into the 
sea. All the people came in, and they all knelt to adore the 
princess. Never had they-seen such a face. She and the prince 
sat together in the window during their last hour. They wept. 
They saw a white cloud. “That is my mother.” A crimson 
cloud came. “That is my father.” A brown cloud came. 
“That is my sister.” Then she herself went away in thunder to 
the clouds. 
1 Variant: The old woman warns that in the morning the father will wake him up and 
invite him into the house. ‘As you follow him, step in his footsteps. If you step any- 
where else, the earth will open and swallow you. The man will offer you anything you see. 
Say you have all such things in your own country. Take nothing but an old guitar. Say 
that is what you like. He will offer you things a thousand times more valuable. Say that 
is all you want. Take it with your left hand, run, and don’t look back!” (Fogo.)

The prince grieved. His father offered to give him whatever 
he wanted. He asked for a servant and a suit of clothes to go 
hunting. After they were out hunting three months, they lost 
their way. He prayed to God to take him out of the world. He 
saw a hole in the ground. He and his servant went down into it. 
They came to a city, to a king’s house. The first person he met 
was the servant he had known under the sea. She called him 
“Pelingrino.” She said, “Go away, and come back at mid-day!”” 
On her return home, the princess had become dumb and sick. 
Her father wanted her to marry her cousin.’ The servant told 
her the prince was at the door. “You may speak now.” The 
princess said, “If you have me speak, and I fail to see the prince, 
I will have you beheaded.” The princess would not see the 
prince until she saw the ring she had given him. He sent the 
ring in by the servant. When he heard that the princess was to 
marry her cousin the following Sunday, he threatened to kill 
himself. The princess said to her father, “I had a silver key, and 
IT lost it. Which should I use,— an iron key, or the silver key 
after I found it again?”—‘The silver key.”—‘‘Then it is the 
prince I am to marry, not my cousin.” She went up to the priest 
with the prince. The cousin killed himself. 
127, ERLADIN. 
There was a woman who was married and lost her husband. 
She had one son named Erladin. She was poor, and she went out 
picking up beans. Her son picked up things on the street to eat. 
One day he met a man. He gave the boy five dollars to take to 
his mother to put her house to rights (ranga casa) for him to visit. 
He said to the boy, “TI am your uncle.” The boy answered, ‘“‘My 
father had no brother.” He said to him, “You do not know me.” 
The boy took the five dollars to his mother. That night the man 
came. The next morning, when the cock crowed for the first time, 
they got up, they ate, they started out. They walked four days. 
The boy became hungry. He told the man that unless he gave

Verde Islander. It appears to have a literary source. Unfortunately a less literary 
variant told by Atarcaseias Monteiro of Boa Vista was not completed. It began as follows: 
The first magician (magice) in the extreme (extremidad’) of Europe, named José de Al- 
cunhea, knew that in the extreme of Asia there was a hole, and in the bottom of it a lamp. 
He thought that if he got the lamp he would be the foremost magician in the world. He 
started to walk to Asia in the company of adog. He walked to the limits of Russia, where 
he met some boys fifteen, sixteen, and seventeen years old. They were playing together 
and fighting. — Compare Philippines, JAFL 20 : 117-118,

him something to eat he would not go on. The man gave him 
something to eat, they walked on to the foot of the mountain, 
they made a fire. There wasa hole. The man tied a rope to the 
boy and lowered him down into the hole. He said to him, “On . 
your way down don’t look about until you get the enchanted 
lantern.” He took the lantern and all kinds of fruits, and wrapped 
them in the skirt of his shirt. He went up. The man told him 
to give him the lantern. He said, “No. Take me out, and then 
I will give you the lantern. The man kept asking for the lantern 
for four days. Then he cut the rope, and let him fall down into 
the hole. The boy was hungry and sleepy, he leaned on the 
lantern. An enchanted one (incantad’) came; he said to him, 
“Erladin, I am enchanted in the lantern. Whatever you ask for, 
I will give you.”—“My uncle, give me something to eat.” A 
table came, he ate. Next day he was sleepy again, his head fell 
on the table, the enchanted one spoke again. He said, “My 
uncle, take me out of this place.” He went up, he saw nobody, 
he went home. 
When he reached home, the fruits he had in his shirt were 
turned to diamonds. He gave them to his mother, and told her 
to take them to the king. “Ask him to send me word the day I 
am to marry his daughter.” The woman went, the king paid no 
attention to her. He said to his mother, “To-day he paid no 
attention to you, but go again to-morrow. He paid no attention 
to you, but neither did he whip you.” The king took the dia- 
monds. He said to her, “Go home. To-morrow I will send word 
to your son.” The King of the Moors told this king that the 
diamonds were given to the boy by one enchanted. The king 
‘said, “No, that boy is still too young to know about enchant- 
ments.” Within three days they announced the marriage of the 
king’s daughter to the son of the King of the Moors. They sent 
up rockets in the marriage-procession. Erladin left the marriage- 
procession and went home. At night he picked up the lantern, 
the enchanted one came. He said to him, “I want you to take 
the princess and put her in my room. Take the prince, put him 
on my horse, and every five minutes dump a bucket of water over 
his head.” Then he sharpened his sword and put it between 
himself and the princess. In the morning the princess was back 
again in her room. The prince could not get to her room, for he 
had to stand back of the horse in the stall. She said to her father, 
“If I were married to Erladin, he would be a better husband than

that man who is still outside my door.” The prince wanted to 
go away because of what he had been through; so the king sent 
for Erladin, and said he would marry him to his daughter. 
The day before his marriage, Erladin was cleaning his lantern, 
the enchanted one came. He said, “Whatever you ask for, I will 
give you.”—‘‘I want you to give me a house (sobrado) four stories 
higher than the king’s.”” The day after they were married, Erladin 
went hunting. To the house came a man who wanted to exchange 
old lanterns for new. (It-was the same man.) The woman took 
the lantern and gave it to the man for anewone. As the man was 
cleaning it, the enchanted one came, and said to him, “‘ Whatever 
you ask for, I will give you.”—‘‘I want you to take Erladin’s 
house, with everything in it, and put it near my house in another 
city, and leave no trace.” The next morning, when the king did 
not see his daughter, he sent four hundred soldiers for Erladin. 
They brought him to the king. He asked the king to let him go 
free for four days. Then he went to a high cliff and threw him- 
self off. He fell without hurt. So he went to a still higher cliff 
and jumped off. Again he fell without hurt. He started for 
a still higher cliff. Midway the enchanted one stopped him. 
He said to him, “‘Erladin, why do you want to kill yourself?”— 
“T want to kill myself because my house has disappeared.”— 
“Erladin, the ring you have on your finger is not equal to the 
lantern; but anything you ask for, it will give you.” He asked 
the ring to put him where his wife was. She was dumb, she had 
not spoken to that man. Erladin asked her to take him in. 
When the man came to dinner, Erladin saw the lantern under his 
coat. He told the princess to tell the man she would like some 
wine from her own country, and when the man brought the wine 
to put poison into it. She asked for the wine, she poisoned it, 
the man died. Erladin took the lantern. As he was cleaning it, 
the enchanted one came. He said to him, “I want you to put 
back my house. Rich as it was before, I want it still richer.” 
That night the house was put back, the next morning at seven he 
went to see the king. He said to him, “I have brought you back 
your daughter.”” The king said, “I see that you are a man that 
can take satisfaction in a woman [Ja ’m olha ’ma bé é home’ que 
pode tuma satisfac€o pa’ mulher]. Otherwise I would not marry 
you to my daughter.” The next day Erladin went hunting, but 
he took the lantern with him. The brother of the dead man 
came to the country, and went to Erladin’s house dressed in
-P-A-G-E-394
Folk-Lore from the Cape Verde Islands. 367 
woman’s clothes. When Erladin came home, his wife told him 
she had found company. The woman said to her, “Your house 
is well appointed [bem ’rangad’], but it lacks a bottle of smelling- 
water [vidro de agu’ de che’ro| that would smell all over the world.” 
Erladin asked where he could get it. “At Bai Anton.” (That 
was Inferno.) Erladin got the bottle of smelling-water from his 
lantern. The woman said again, “Your house is well appointed, 
but it lacks a parrot.” Erladin got the parrot from his lantern. 
The woman said again, “Your house is well appointed, but it lacks 
adove.” The enchanted one told Erladin who it was in his house 
who was asking for these things. Then Erladin went home and 
shot the man with his gun. 
128. THE DOG CAPTAIN.! 
There were two friends,— one called Jon; the other, Pedr’. 
They called each other compadre. Pedr’ said, “Jon, you want 
us to get married.” They agreed to serve as padrinh’ de casa- 
ment’ to each other, their wives to serve as madrinh’ de casament’ 
one to the other. Well, they married. Within the year Jon had 
a girl, Pedr’ had a boy. The children were christened the same 
day. Jon served as godfather for Pedr’s son, Pedr’ served as 
godfather for the daughter of Jon. They planned that the chil- 
dren should marry each other. A year later Pedr’ and his wife 
died. They left their son to Jon. He put the children in school 
together. Jonsinh’ always thought he was Jon’s son. One day 
they quarrelled. The little girl said to him, “You are not my 
father’s child.” The little boy got angry. He went home, he 
did not eat. His godmother said to him, “What is the matter 
with you?” He said to her, “Since I am not your son, I do not 
want to stay in this house.” He told his godfather that he was 
going to Praia Nega to ship on board a vessel. 
When he reached Praia Nega, he saw a full-rigged ship. A 
launch came to the dock. Nobody was init but adog. When the 
launch came alongside the dock, Jonsinh’ jumped into it. The 
launch left the dock for the vessel. The boy went aboard, he 
looked all around, he saw nobody but the dog. The vessel iset 
sail. He came out at meal-time, the table was set for him. He 
sailed for one year. He saw land. The sails fell, he dropped 
anchor. 
The dog never talked with the boy; but as they prepared to

go ashore, the dog warned him that it was a strange country. 
“You may be frightened.” They landed, the dog disappeared. 
The boy became hungry, he did not know the language, he staid 
hungry. The dog went home, he dressed up as a rich man, he 
returned to the boy. He said to him, ““Good-day, boy! Why 
have you come to this country?” —“I don’t know.”—“How did 
you come here?” —‘“‘I don’t know.”—‘‘Do you wish to come and 
live with me?” He said, “Yes.” He went to live with him. 
After he had eaten, the man said to him, “Do you wish to marry 
my daughter?’”—‘‘No, I do not wish to marry.”—‘‘ You have not 
seen my daughter. When you see her, you will be crazy for her.” 
The man took him to the room of his daughter. When the boy 
saw her face, as good as it was lovely, he hung his head and wept. 
The man said, ‘What do you think of her?” —“She is very lovely. 
But she comes of rich people. I am a stranger here, and too poor 
to marry her. You must find a rich husband for her.” —“I think 
that her looks do not please you. I will show you another.” 
He took him to another room, he showed him another girl. The 
first was fair, but this one was still fairer. The boy said to him, 
“She is not for me, I am too poor.” He took him toa third room. 
“She is even fairer than the other two,” said the boy; “but she is 
not for me, I am too poor.” 
The man said, “I am going to put you in command of a vessel. 
You must go through three tempests before reaching home to 
keep your promise.” ! He set sail with his crew. A tempest 
came on. He sent all the crew below. He was bent on staying 
alone on deck. The storm swept away the masts. It lasted 
three days. They sewed up the sails, and mended the vessel. 
He sailed on for one year, then he returned. When he returned, 
he met the man who had sent him out. He said to him, “‘ You are 
now a good captain, a man of your word. I will load your vessel 
with gold and diamonds.” 
He loaded his vessel with gold and diamonds. He set sail, he 
sailed for the country of his godfather. When he reached port, 
he exchanged clothes with a sailor. He went to the house of his 
godfather. He reached the door of his godfather. He asked for 
lodging for the night. The man said to him, “No, not if you were 
about to die. Sailors are no good.” His daughter said to him, 
“You were asailor! Here is a poor sailor, and you won’t take him 
1 This refers to his betrothal to the daughter of his godfather. The foregoing episode 
with the three girls is in the nature of a test.

in!” Her father said, “You are going to marry a prince. I want 
no sailor in my house. Sailors are too tricky.” His daughter 
said, “Let him sleep in the barn! At sunrise he can go.” [The 
sailor] kept a journal. He gave it to her before he went to the 
barn. The girl read of all he had been through to keep his word 
to her, also that he was richer than the prince. At midnight, 
when her father was asleep, she went out, she went to the barn, 
she went to look for him, she brought him to her room. In the 
morning the man went to the barn to wake him up. He did not 
find him. He went to his daughter’s room, he found him there. 
Her white dress was all spotted with tar from the clothes of the 
sailor. The man went to get his gun to shoot them both. They 
ran away, they went on boatd his vessel. 
The following day he dressed and went to the house of his god- 
father. He invited him and his godmother to come on board his 
vessel. He said to them that he had been in a tempest, he had 
promised that as soon as he made land he would give a feast and 
invite all he met. The man said to him, “I am sad. I do not 
know if I can go.” He invited all the rich people, the king, and 
the priests. They all went on board. The service was of gold 
and diamonds. The king and queen were bewildered by such 
riches. After dinner he begged them to tell stories. The king 
said to the godfather, “‘You have been much at sea; you tell a 
story.” The godfather told the story of his compadre and of the 
boy. He told how he had risen in the world, and how his daughter 
was betrothed to a king’s son, and how he was now disgraced, and 
his daughter had run away with a sailor. The captain said, “If 
you saw your daughter now, would you not be glad?”—“I don’t 
want to see her any more.”—“If she ran away with the man she 
had been promised to, would you think she had done wrong?” 
He opened the door, she appeared dressed in gold and diamonds. 
‘They embraced each other. The king felt like taking off his 
crown and putting it on the captain. If the godfather had been 
ashamed before over the disgrace of his daughter, he was still more 
ashamed now in the presence of the captain. He kissed his foot.

129. THE SEA-CAPTAIN’S WIFE 
What thing thing? There was a woman, she had a husband at 
sea. The husband did not return. She went and sat down on the 
edge of the sea to wait for the ships she saw, to ask if they could 
give her news of her husband. The first ship which she saw, she 
called the captain, she asked if he could not give her news of her 
husband. : 
“Ah, my captain of the sea, 
Ai, ai, farewell! 
Would you give me news of my husband? 
Ai, farewell!” 
Her husband was on that ship. Then her husband answered, and 
said that he could not give her news of her husband. 
“Ah, Dona Selifina Libana, 
Ai, farewell! 
I give no news of her husband. 
Ai, farewell! 
Would you desire a house of gold? 
Ai, farewell!”’ 
Then the man went, he returned to the ship. The woman 
called, she asked if he could not give her news of her husband. 
“Ah, my captain of the sea, 
Ai, ai, farewell! 
Would you give me news of my husband? 
Ai, farewell!” 
The captain answered that he could give her no news of her 
husband. 
“Ah, Dona Selifina Libana, 
Ai, farewell! 
I give no news of her husband. 
Ai, farewell! 
Would you desire a purse of gold? 
Ai, farewell!” 
Then he came back, he asked her if she wanted a chain of gold. 
She said she wanted no chain of gold.

“Ah, my captain of the sea, 
Ai, farewell! 
Would you desire a chain of gold, 
Ai, farewell! 
I want only the favor of my husband. 
Ai, farewell!” 
He came back again, her husband sprang ashore. He saw that 
his wife was true, because he had offered her a gold purse and 
chain, and she refused to take them. 
130. BURIED IN THE CORNFIELD,! 
What thing thing? There was a woman, she had a husband 
called Mr. Terenden. The woman was called Mrs. Calinca. The 
husband told his wife that he was dying, for her to bury him in a 
hole (i.e., field) of speckled corn. Then he made out he died. 
The woman went to bury him in a field of speckled corn. 
Then the woman sent the little boy every day to take care of the 
chickens. Every time the boy came to the place, he shooed off 
the chickens. ‘ 
“Cho, cho, wood-hen! 
Cho, cho, wood-hen! 
My mother, who planted, is not eating it. 
My father, who planted, is not eating it. 
I believe it is you, 
I believe it is you eating it, 
I believe it is you eating it.” 
The father answered him,— 
“Tt is your father, it’s me, eating it. 
It is your father, it’s me, eating it.” 
Then he went home; he said to his mother that every time he 
shooed off the chickens, a voice answered, saying, “It is your 
father, it’s me, eating it.” His mother did not believe what he 
said. She took hold of him, she beat him. He said to his mother, 
if she did not believe, for her to go with him to see. Then his 
mother went with him. He called to the chickens; the man

answered him, “It’s your father, it’s me, eating it.” The woman 
went until she reached it. She said, “It’s you eating all this corn 
this way!” The man was ashamed; he said, ‘“‘No, it is not he, 
it is not he, no!” Then they separated everything they had. 
They separated, each apart from the other.

131. CONFIDENTIAL! 
You are like that wolf who told his wife to prepare for him - 
something to eat for a week, for him to go and work ina place. He 
went, he did nothing, he ate, he lay down. At the end of a week 
the woman went to see what her husband was doing. When Wolf 
saw his wife coming, he said to her, “Woman, all this is very con- 
fidential, you can’t see it, you can’t see it.” He covered it with 
his cloak. 
132. THE PARROT IN TROUBLE.? 
There was a man who was a merchant. He had a cat and a 
parrot. He put the parrot to guard the door. At this moment a 
customer came in, and the man was frying fish. He asked what 
was the price of a line. The merchant answered him that the 
line was sixteen hundred reis a yard. The customer went away. 
This price staid in the mind of the parrot. Then came another 
customer, he asked the price of bread. The parrot answered him, 
“Sixteen hundred reis.”” Soon the merchant came in. He waited 
on the customer. The customer ordered cut four yards of bread. 
When the customer began to pay, he wanted to get more for the 
bread. Then the customer said to him that he was cheating him. 
The parrot continued to say, “Sixteen hundred! Sixteen hun- 
dred! Sixteen hundred!” The customer went away. The 
merchant took a stick, he began to beat the parrot. The parrot 
ran, he got under the bed. When the man went to the kitchen, 
where he was cooking fish, he found the cat had eaten up all the 
fish. With the same stick he began to beat the cat. And the 
cat ran, and went and hid under the bed in the same place where 
the parrot was. Poor frightened parrot! He asked the cat, “You,

too, did you say sixteen hundred reis? The best thing we can do 
is to leave his house, go and live with some one else.” They left 
the house of this merchant, they went to live in the house of a 
farmer in the country. 
1334 GOOSE AND CAT ENTERTAIN: FISH MEDICINE. 
_ There were Goose and Cat. Goose invited Cat to help her 
work. When Cat went, Goose put dinner into a gourd. Cat did 
not eat anything. Another time Cat invited Goose. When 
Goose went, Cat put dinner on a flat stone. Goose had a neck- 
like mouth, she did not eat anything. Then they got mad. 
Afterwards they met again, they got on with each other. They 
said they would live together. ‘They lived in a place where there 
was no food, only the sea. They made a little house. Goose 
went fishing, she caught three fish, she took the fish and gave them 
' to her family. When Goose went fishing again, Cat ate the fish 
away from her children. When she [Goose] came back, she found 
the children hungry. Then she got mad. Goose begged Cat for 
them to go fishing together. Cat fell into the sea. She called 
Goose to save her. Goose said to her that if she would never 
again eat fish away from her children, she would save her. Cat 
told Goose to get her before her tail got wet, because, if her tail 
got wet, she would die. Goose got her. When they came ashore, 
Cat went to the said’ of fish.2 The said’ gave her a piece of rotten 
fish. The said’ ordered her to go to the black sea to cast away the 
rotten fish. When she saw a red fish coming, she was to ask the 
red fish for medicine. .. . She asked for medicine. The fish gave 
her his gall, for her to mix with the droppings of Goose to drink. 
She drank. Never again did she eat fish away from her children.

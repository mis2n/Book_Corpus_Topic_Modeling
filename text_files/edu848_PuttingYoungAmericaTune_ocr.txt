INTRODUCTION 
‘How can I make my child like music?” is a 
question being asked by countless thousands of 
parents. 
There is a national awakening to the fact that 
music is a live factor in our modern civilization. 
In our schools, in our homes, in civic life, it is 
being reckoned with as an influence of the first 
importance. That is because we are learning to 
know music. 
The one thing above all else that has brought 
about this change in the popular estimation of 
music is the mechanical reproduction of its litera-. 
ture. The player piano and the phonograph have 
multiplied masterly interpretations to such an 
extent that millions of people today are connois-_ 
seurs who twenty years ago did not know one tune 
from another. And what is more, did not care. 
Our people are learning to talk glibly of much 
that. is best in opera, in song, violin or piano 
literature. Artists whose records are liked are 
sure of large and enthusiastic audiences wherever 
they may appear. We say we are ‘‘becoming a 
musical nation,’’ quite forgetting that we have 
been potentially musical all the time, only needing 
to have this latent characteristic awakened. In

like degree every child is ‘‘musical.’”’ The thor- 
oughly ‘‘unmusical’’ person virtually does not 
exist. : 
It is the aim of this book to set forth as simply 
as possible the practical problems that confront 
parents in the development of the music sense in 
their children, to emphasize the parents’ responsi- 
bility in this respect, and to prove that technical 
knowledge is not necessary for this home training. 
The points brought out here are a crystalliza- 
tion of questions asked in a voluminous corre- 
spondence extending over several countries, the 
letters being the result of a series of articles in 
Mother’s Magazine and Home Life. 
There is a degree of urge in these eager ques- 
tions that would seem to be the best reason for 
this attempt at an answer.

CHAPTER I 
THE MAGIC OF MUSIC 
The sacred power of music, who shall tell, 
Who find the secret of its mastery? 
—Celia Thaster. 
“‘No, I am not musical,’ a friend said. to me, 
and at that moment jumped from his chair and 
rushed to the window. 
On the boulevard below his office a military band 
was blaring a cheerful marching message, and 
my ‘‘unmusical’’ friend listened with eager atten- 
tion while he drummed with his fingers on the 
window-sill, in time to the tune. 
“Then what did you.do that for?’’ I asked. 
“Do what?’ he returned, coming back to his 
desk. ‘‘Oh—the band? I simply can’t sit still 
when they go by.”’ : 
Quite unconsciously he had flatly refuted his 
earlier statement, for had he been truly unmusical 
he would have paid no attention to the band, or - 
even if he had noticed it, would have found no 
pleasure in it. 
Much of the compelling force of music is lost 
9
-P-A-G-E-9
10 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
upon us because we react to it unconsciously for 
one thing, and on the other hand we do not realize 
to what an extent pleasant sound-waves are filling 
the air about us. 
We are—most of us—tone deaf, so music enters 
our lives just through a very narrow door that 
leads directly to a definite something, ranging 
from a symphony concert to Susan’s misuse of 
’ the latest in her repertoire. We pigeonhole our 
moments of musical relaxation in such orderly 
fashion that artificialities hedge them about. We 
“do” music in one form or another because it is 
the thing to do, or.someone else wishes it, or 
nothing more interesting offers itself in its place. 
Only: a few recognize it as a need. Once in a 
while you hear the remark, ‘‘I am just hungry for 
some good music.’” But as a rule we pay so little 
heed to our instincts, or allow them to become so 
~ over-educated that they just naturally lie down 
and die. 
Our apparently unmusical status as a nation is 
suffering from artificial over-education and mal- 
nutrition. It is a sad combination. 
“We have worked many centuries to squeeze all 
the joy out of listening to music by making the 
means of enjoyment more and more complex, until 
now, when we find oursélves starving in spite of 
the abundance about us, a dilemma confronts us 
much like that of the little old man ‘“‘who was so 
wondrous wise’’ that when he found a bramble
-P-A-G-E-10
THE MAGIC OF MUSIC 1 
bush had scratched out both his eyes, ‘with all 
his might and main, he jumped into another bush 
and scratched them in again.’’ 
After starving our music sense and trying our 
best, by wrong methods, to transform our reaction 
to it into a lifeless, analytical and empty thing, 
instead of the warm, glowing healthful reaction 
it should be, we are at last busily working to put 
it all back again into its rightful place as a joy- 
giver. 
There is no accounting for the magic of music - 
—the strange power that lies in a set of quivering 
vibrations. It starts a man to dreaming, a woman 
to weeping, a child to dancing. The immediate 
response to a given piece varies with every list- 
ener. It is there for you to get out of it what you 
will—and what you need. 
And what do we need? .A mode of self-expres- 
sion. That is as necessary to us as the air we 
breathe. - 
Giving voice to our emotions, our feelings, our 
desires, is a primitive instinct, an elemental need. 
The baby in the cradle yells its disapproval or 
impatience with full lungs, whimpers its fear, 
croons its contentment. The baby knows. And 
its noises (beg pardon, baby) are as expressive 
of its moods and emotions as are any more con- 
scious modes of self-expression later in life. 
Moreover they have the saving grace of being 
absolutely sincere! :
-P-A-G-E-11
12 PUTTING YOUNG. AMERICA IN TUNE 
J. The ways of infants and savages are strangely 
similar. ‘ 
What the baby wants it goes after and gets. 
So with the savage. The infant, to be sure, does . 
not use a club and brute force, but its methods are 
no less direct. Just as the response to sound 
sensations is instinctive and of an elemental sim- 
plicity, so the child knows, perhaps sooner than © 
anything else, the power in the performance of 
sound, Its first conscious act is to cry its wants 
to the world, and it learns, soon enough, that such 
’ self-expression brings desired results. 
And these impulses later give rise to natural 
and calculated expressions of states of feeling, to 
gestures and varied cries (no longer just the 
sturdy yell of the tiny cradle), and to bodily 
movement and singing. Laughter and light, quick 
cries are the natural accompaniment to a joyful 
skipping about; darker toned shouts or growls 
accompany the angry gesture, or at least express 
the mood even if restraint somewhat curbs the 
physical expression of it. 
And so it is with primitive man. With him 
| sound and gesture were the mediums by which he 
expressed his own emotions or excited emotion in 
others. His primitive arrangement of sounds 
which to him meant music, was indulged in per- 
haps simply for the pleasurable quality, or to act 
as a menace or warning, thereby becoming an aid 
to the instinct of self-preservation.
-P-A-G-E-12
THE MAGIC OF MUSIC 13 
Tonal expression became an integral part o 
his celebrations, his religious rites, and all publi 
gatherings. He strutted as he stressed his songs © 
of victory, languor and grace imbued movements 
that accompanied his attempts to entice love, and 
he bowed his body in anguish as he chanted or 
moaned his song of defeat or grief. 
The reaction to natural impulses here touched 
upon may seem to be something far afield from 
musie as we know it. In fact it must appear, at, 
first glance, to be entirely too remote for any pos- 
sible excuse as a place in this book. And yet we 
shall see, presently, that instead of being remote, 
the giving way to these impulses is the cue. that 
leads most directly to a practical solution of hov 
to develop the music sense in the child. Primitive 
man was no more easily affected by these psy: 
chological reactions produced by sound than are 
we, adults and children of the present day. 
To find the origin of music we must go far 
/ indeed, for music existed as a definite expressior. 
of emotion long before it became a conscious art. 
It is as old as creation and as new as the dawn, 
as old as love and hatred and jealousy, as new as 
every fresh joy and sorrow. And through it all, 
from its very beginnings to its most complex 
modern expression, there has been a steady under- 
current of one thing that is always present, and 
that is rhythm. 
We might paraphrase that squib of sophistica-
-P-A-G-E-13
\ e 4 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
tion, “talent i is something but tact is everything,’’ 
by writing it ‘harmony i is something but rhythm 
is everything. ”»\ Rhythm i is the motive power of 
expression through sound. It is the steam-engine 
of music. And.so we find it to be invariably the 
basic principle on which musical expression is 
founded. 
Why this is so will be taken up in the next 
chapter when the natural response to rhythm as 
evidenced by the child will be discussed. 
The potency and charm of artificially produced 
sound, the peculiar effect of varying rhythms, 
‘pitches and tone-colors—all this invested the 
earliest attempts at music with such a mysterious 
power that, like the equally inexplicable phe- 
nomena of nature, the mind of primitive man 
ascribed it to a supernatural source. Conse-* 
quently as an art it long remained as imperfect _ 
as its legendary powers were portentous. 
. Music was looked upon as a supernatural force 
‘given to man by the gods to be used as a bless- 
ing, as a consolation, as a weapon of defense, or 
for personal aggrandizement. From which it may 
be deduced that even in this early stage of music’s 
history its kaleidoscopic nature began to be under- 
stood. Even in its simplest form it began to be 
all things to all men. 
The most picturesque pages in the world’s 
book of fairy tales are those devoted to the legends 
that tell of the origin of music. Evidently its
-P-A-G-E-14
THE MAGIC OF MUSIC 15 
magic has held sway throughout the world, for 
wherever we turn—from the bamboo covered 
mountain tops of China to the dark forests of the 
North American Indian—from the tropical banks 
of the River Niger to the stern rockbound coasts 
of Finland—everywhere the miraculous power of 
music has become entwined in the folklore of the 
people. 
No attempt shall be made here to treat this sub- 
ject. from a scientific standpoint. Just a few 
legends will be indicated by outlines to emphasize 
the true significance of music’s fairy tale begin- 
nings. 
‘With pipe and fiute the rustic Pan 
Of old made music sweet for man; 
And wonder hushed the warbling bird, 
And closer drew the calm-eyed herd— 
The rolling river slowlier ran. 
—Austin Dodson. | 
So speaks the poet of the great god Pan, whose 
wondrous harmonies subdued all living things 
who heard him—even humans. And here is the 
story of how he came by the marvelous instrument 
that could pour forth such sweet tones. 
There was a lovely woodland nymph named 
Syrinx. Pan, the god who presided over the 
woods and dells, fell in love with her, but in spite 
of all his wooing, she invariably fled at sight of 
him. Now one day it seemed as though Pan would 
surely catch her, so her sister nymphs trans- 
*
-P-A-G-E-15
16 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
formed her into a hollow reed that she might 
escape her pursuer. But she sighed for the care- 
free life she had lost, for she was now rooted to 
one spot, and it is this soft music we hear even 
to this day wherever reeds grow by the edge of 
- the water. 
Pan also heard the faint sighing of his beloved. ~ 
Syrinx, and so he cut a number of reeds to trans- . 
form the music to his own uses. With grasses he 
tied several of these hollow reeds or pipes together 
and blew into them, making a strange and melan- 
choly music. This little instrument came to be - 
called the Pipes of Pan, and so miraculous was 
the effect of these sweet sounds that the birds in 
‘the tree tops would stop their own song to listen, 
and even the wild beasts of the forest would draw 
near and become tamed and subdued by its power, 
The story of Pan, in one guise or another, runs 
like a ribbon around the world, binding the edge 
where, myth merges into history. This tale of 
spell-bound nature sets before us in a nutshell 
the mysterious power of sound to which savages 
and children give themselves up whole-heartedly. 
It seems that we alone who are analytical grown- 
ups cannot permit ourselves to be so susceptible. 
That is something remaining for us to learn. 
Pan with his flute (or pipes) was not the only 
divinity who could produce such marvels, for, of 
course, you have heard of Orpheus and his lyre. 
The music of a stringed instrument was his
-P-A-G-E-16
THE MAGIC OF MUSIC 17 
medium of expression, for he was a mighty pagan , 
god, son of Apollo, and more important in the 
scheme of things, so he believed, than a half wild 
woodland creature like Pan. So Orpheus devel- 
oped such mastery that when he played all living 
things were at his beck and call, and he could - 
even move mountains by his wonderful music. 
The Chinese will tell you about their music-god, 
Konei, who seems to have been no less remarkable, . 
than Orpheus. But Konei knew nothing of the 
magic, either of strings or hollow reeds. For 
him the wonders of nature gave up yet another 
secret—the wizardry of sound in mighty stones. 
By experimenting Konei found certain great 
stones which, when struck, gave forth deep musical 
tones almost like those of an organ. Some tones 
were high and others so deep and low they fairly 
boomed their message to the world. And Konei 
was such a master too, that like Pan and Orpheus, 
he could venture into the densest forest without 
fear, for all wild creatures seemed to love him 
and his music. . 
Of course you have heard about seales, and 
you probably have learned to play them on your 
piano and don’t like them a bit because they seem, 
dry and uninteresting ladders to musical pro- 
ficiency. Or you have do-re-mi-fa-d them at school 
until you are quite sure they are the most sense-. 
less contrivances ever invented. But in spite of 
being so apparently prosaic, the musical scale
-P-A-G-E-17
18 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
really had a wonderful beginning if we are to 
believe the legend about the miraculous birds. 
Many hundreds of years ago a certain emperor 
ecame very impatient with the folk music of 
uis country. His people were forever bickering 
_ about what constituted the true and correct basis 
of their music, and they couldn’t agree about the 
seale at all. They kept on quarrelling until the 
emperor got tired of hearing them disagree, and 
in great haste summoned his prime minister to 
appear before him. 
‘“We must stop all this confusion. Go to the 
Sacred Mountain and find a solution,’’ commanded 
the emperor. 
So the prime minister went up to the very top 
of the Sacred Mountain, which was completely 
covered by a forest of bamboo trees. He pondered 
long as to what course to pursue, when suddenly 
the wind blowing gently through the woods 
brought with it a low, sighing monotone. This 
gave the prime minister a happy thought.. He. 
cut a piece of bamboo, made it hollow, and spoke 
through it. Behold! The tone it gave forth was 
exactly like his natural speaking voice when he 
was not agitated, only it was more pleasant and 
sonorous. Scarcely had he sounded this marvel- 
ous note three times when two miraculous birds, 
with wonderful plumage, came and perched on the 
nearest bamboo trees.. One was a male bird and 
the other a female, and éach chirped a set of six
-P-A-G-E-18
THE MAGIC OF MUSIC 19 
notes. But the lady-bird sang just a bit higher - 
than the other, and these twelve tones constitute 
to this day the notes of the chromatic scale. 
' Without music the world would be an impossibl 
place to live in the Japanese believe, and in thei 
beautiful cherry-blossom country you may hea 
the tale of the sun-goddess. 
She it was who brought light and happiness into 
the world. But one day, in resentment at the 
behaviour of an evil-disposed brother, she hid her- 
self in a cave, and at once the universe was 
plunged into darkness and anarchy. Everything 
was tried to propitiate the sun-goddess, but noth- 
ing would persuade her to leave the cave. The 
people were in the greatest despair until one of 
their beneficent gods conceived that the magic of 
‘mnusic might produce the desired miracle. So they 
gathered all their finest singers and_ players 
together and these poured forth their musical ‘ 
offering until the lure of their enticing strains 
proved so great that the sun-goddess came out of 
the cave where she had hidden herself, and at once 
light and happiness returned to the earth. So it 
is no wonder, is it, that the Japanese call music a 
blessing? : 
These and innumerable other legends tell us in 
no uncertain way that music has always wielded a 
miraculous power. But if we are to learn from 
these legends their symbolic meaning, would it 
not seem that music is not merely a sense-lulling

20 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
opiate letting us dream down the river of life, but 
rather that its wider mission shall be to bring a 
newer enlightenment into this complex modern 
civilization of ours? : 
The response to music was instinctive in primi- 
‘tive man, it is instinctive in the child, and it can 
_ be instinctive with us if we make up our minds 
not to be afraid of its power. In our harried 
national existence we almost forget there are wide. 
spaces all about inhabited by beauty, serenity and 
inspiration, and these delectable regions of the art 
spirit can be acquired at the price of just one thing 
—an attitude of appreciation that is at the same 
time one of response. We must permit it to be 
the sincere obeying of a natural impulse, for after 
‘all the cradle of musical consciousness lies in the 
human Heart.

CHAPTER IT 
WHEN TO BEGIN MUSICAL TRAINING 
All one's life is a music if one touches the notes rightly and in tune. 
-—Ruskin. | 
The question uppermost in the minds of parents. . 
as regards musical training is ‘‘when to begin” 
it. The accompanying question, ‘‘How to begin”’ 
is not heard as frequently although it is of equal * 
if not greatér importance. ‘‘When to begin’’ 
signifies with most people the age suitable for 
commencing lessons on the piano or some other 
instrument. The moment for ‘‘taking lessons,’’ 
like a dose of medicine, has arrived. Tell us, 
Doctor, what to do to have it over with! 
And chow??? 
‘‘Oh! get a good teacher’’ and be dong with it. 
No, you cannot dismiss it that way. {The time 9 
for ‘‘taking music’’ begins long before the time 
for calling in a professional teacher _has arrived. 
This is a fact not yet generally realized by parents. _ 
, So the answer must be: The time to begin your 
' child’s musical training is in the nursery. And-. 
the earlier, the better. 
In the first place your child has a right to musie. 
Failure to develop his taste in this direction tig 
a loss of happiness,’’ says Darwin, ‘‘and may pos- 
21
-P-A-G-E-21
. “pe PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
sibly be injurious to the intellect and more prob- 
ably to the moral character.’’ So you see what 
a formidable responsibility is placed on the 
shoulders of music training. Your child’s ulti- 
“\mate happiness, intellectual, development, and 
moral character are at stake) Had you thought 
~ of that? Then how could the training of a taste © 
t i for music begin too soon? 
We have already seen in Chapter I that the 
feeling for music is instinctive. Here we shall 
find that the response to sound impressions is 
one of the earliest manifestations of the infant 
mind at work. : 
Sharp or sudden noises will make a baby jump 
nervously. Soft and pleasant sounds, the more 
purely musical the better, will soon bring a coo 
of contentment and the first smile. Harmony in 
the nursery is a much desired condition. Har- 
mony of color and harmony of sound. In the 
strictly musical sense harmony is here used pho- — 
. netically rather than literally, for whatever music 
is used for the baby’s benefit should be of the 
simplest possible. 
Of all the beautiful music in the world nothing 
can equal the crooning of lullabies. They are the 
very essence of mother love, and it is not only the 
- low soft tones or the simple melody that sings 
your little one to sleep with a seraphic smile of 
contentment. It is the spirit of the music behind 
the obvious melody winging its message from the
-P-A-G-E-22
WHEN TO BEGIN MUSICAL TRAINING 23 
mother heart to the baby’s, that makes the 
witchery of lullabies more beautiful than anything 
else in the world. 
The instinctive reaction to pleasant and un-f ; 
pleasant sounds, and the pleasurable sensations 
manifested in response to the former, is the 
child’s innate sense of music. Denied the oppor- 
tunity to exergjse itself, it will remain latent an 
perhaps die. fi is in these days of early infanc 
that your child’s feeling for tone should be sul 
jected to the first training, for what, after all, is 
training but a gentle guidance toward develop- . 
ment? It cannot be emphasized too strongly that 
what you make of this great opportunity and 
pleasant occupation is the influence that will make 
your child later in life apparently a ‘‘musical’’ 
or an ‘‘unmusical’’ person. 
A. child brought up under circumstances where 
it never heard human speech would fall back on v 
primitive means and sounds for the purpose of 
expressing himself, and would be practically in- 
capable of human speech. As a parallel it may be 
pointed out right here that the music instinct so 
deeply rooted, is a part of man’s nature, not 
merely a talent given to a select few./ The man 
who ‘‘can’t tell one tune from another’ is made, 
not born. He simply lost this precious possession 
very early in life and then concluded he had never 
had it. . 
The first musical training, as such, commences >
-P-A-G-E-23
24 ‘PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
‘with the baby’s first consciousness of rhythm.- 
That is the element in music capable of being 
grasped long before there is any sense of melody. 
But rhythm consciousness must not be confounded 
with the reaction to sound sensations already 
described. The latter is merely a reaction of feel- 
ing. Unpleasant sounds jar. Pleasant sounds. 
sooth. 
Imitative response to rhythm is, on the other 
hand, a conscious act, and can be awakened and 
developed as soon as the infant mind can take 
hold and retain anything. The baby sitting in its 
high chair pounding the table edge with a spoon 
will soon imitate your beat when by pounding you 
gain its attention. At once the baby commences 
to get real fun out of the rhythmic swing. 
Just as rhythm is one of the most marked char- 
acteristics in music, so the feeling for it is one of 
the strongest impulses. Children and savages are 
alike in this. Primitive music is always built on 
a rhythmic pattern. Any conscious expression 
of sound for the purpose of bringing about a 
definite emotional effect is put on a time basis. 
How naturally children follow this. instinctive 
mode of procedure is shown by the rhythm under- 
'. Tying all of their play. This will be described. 
more fully in Chapter IV. 
To go back to the infant, we find that the first 
mode of self-expression that can be classified as 
something quite separate from the expression of
-P-A-G-E-24
WHEN TO BEGIN MUSICAL TRAINING 25 
desires, is governed by rhythm. This sense, then, 
is present long before there is any realization of 
beauty of melody. The baby’s reaction to just a 
plain noise or the mother’s song does not denote 
an ability to appreciate the difference, excepting 
as it jars or soothes. It is simply an instinctive 
animal response to what is unpleasant or pleas- 
ant, classifying under the same head as a pin- 
prick or a nice warm bottle of milk. 
Now no mother would deliberately subject her 
offspring to pin-pricks. By the same token she 
should keep discordant noises out of the nursery 
“nd supply, instead, those that any human would 
ke. We shall see in the next chapter that a chaos 
f unnecessarily disagreeable sounds is likewise

Meanwhile we find the baby has an ear for 
ausic. Although its shudder at a slamming door 
nd its cooing obligato to a lullaby at first are not’ 
oncerned with any conscious sense of anything 
xcept the fundamental difference between what 
listurbs and what does not disturb, we find, even

-P-A-G-E-25

Right here is where the foundation for musical 
taste is most securely laid. 
Rhythm codrdinated with soft sweet sounds is 
‘the perfect child music. And baby specialists are 
now advocating the use of suitable rhythmic exer- 
cises to the accompaniment of music, beginning at 
the age of one year. It is a proved theory, suc- 
cessfully practiced, that this musical treatment 
-started so early and judiciously continued 
throughout childhood improves the baby’s health, 
develops the muscles, and somehow helps to put 
even a very tiny atom of humanity ‘‘in tune with 
the infinite.’? At least its tendency is toward that 
millennium. In any event it has a distinct and 
beneficial effect on the child’s physical well-being. 
Coming back to tone qualities, it is easily demon- 
stratable that, children like certain ones better 
than others. .They prefer a xylophone, for in- 
stance, to a piano. And they are especially fond, 
too, of a flute or a violin. Probably the piano 
would be more popular with the small child if it 
were used with skill and loving care. But more 
generally it is thoughtlessly banged on by various 
members of the family, more often than not it is 
badly out of tune, and the youngest member of the 
household—still in possession of an unperverted. 
taste in music—very naturally places this bang- 
ing right i in the category where it belongs, that of 
noise. { Children’s instinctive taste for music is 
always good.
-P-A-G-E-26
WHEN TO BEGIN MUSICAL TRAINING 27 
If you care for their musical welfare you should 
by all means have a little xylophone in your house. 
One of several octaves and amply fulfilling every 
requirement can be obtained for about twenty- 
five dollars. Smaller ones for much less, and then, 
of course, you can go up to four hundred dollars. 
But that is neither necessary nor desirable. The 
twenty-five dollar one will do perfectly. 
Its clear silvery tones delight even the very 
young baby, and mother can follow the book of 
instruction and easily learn to play a variety of 
tunes on it even if she knows not a note of music. - 
Before long the two-year-old will experiment with _ 
it himself. The sense of melody and rhythm at_ 
that age begins to develop rapidly, you will need ° . 
instrumental aid, and soon you will learn to look 
upon the xylophone as the most valuable piece of 
furniture in the nursery. 
But playing even on the xylophone is not a 
child’s' first conscious attempt at making music. 
Long before a baby can carry a tune, that is, can 
imitate melody, he enjoys melody. Even when 
only a year old he will hum funny little tunes of 
his own invention. This is one of his first con- 
scious efforts at self-expression, and curiously 
enough these little musical meanderings take on 
a definite form. They are the baby’s property 
and he brings them out to use at his will. He 
should under no circumstances be discouraged, 
nor should his virtuoso efforts be laughed at or
-P-A-G-E-27
28 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
applauded. He must not be made self-conscious 
with this first accomplishment. This music-mak- 
ing is a precious thing. In his own baby fashion 
he is enjoying his God-given instinct for musie— . 
the instinct that our modern education has with 
great care almost eliminated from our make-up. 
There our over-education is at fault again! 
Now we are completing the circle and trying 
to undo what we have done. Individuals and 
national organizations are codperating to put the 
music instinct back in our souls. They think 
community music will do it, and it is having its 
abundant results no doubt, although it is difficult 
to teach an old dog new tricks. But it is the best 
that can be done with the present non-musical 
generation. Let us see to it that with the coming- 
on set of humans no such uprooting need take 
place. , 
‘We have amply demonstrated in ourselves the 
truth that any instinct, if starved, will just nat= 
urally die like other things subjected to the starva- 
tion process. What of music? It became an arti- 
ficial feature of our cultural training. It was arti- 
ficially applied. It was made ugly where it should 
have been beautiful, tiresome where it should have 
been a delight. No such thing as a music-hater 
was ever born in the world, but we have been bus- 
ily manufacturing them for many years. No won- 
der we have been described as an unmusical peo- 
ple. Slowly the pendulum is swinging the other

way. Every effort is being made to transplant our: 
dying musical instincts, and happily, as we shall 
see in future chapters, the transplanting is bring- 
ing welcome results. 
Meanwhile do we pause to reflect that music is 
as natural to the human being as speech? And in 
fact that the music instinct is given utterance 
first? We have seen already that this is true of 
the child. It is also true in the history of the race. 
Music—in other words, the song imitation of 
sounds in nature—came before intelligible speech. 
These imitative sounds -were for the purpose of 
interpreting human feelings, and so eloquent was 
the medium even in its primitive form that it. 
seemed to primeval man to be a thing far greater. 
than himself—something of divine origin. 
And must we not suppose that the infant’s little _ 
song means much more than the atom of humanity - 
has any idea of? With the music instinct so 
deeply rooted, the child bursts into song on the 
slightest provocation. It is only our mistaken 
notion of its true function and the foolish limit 
of exclusiveness we have tried to label it with that 
has fairly killed the art in its broader aspects, and 
almost driven it out of the modern scheme of 
things as far as being a live factor is concerned. 
. A recognition of the true function of music as 
being much.more than a mere cultural asset, is 
bringing about the national awakening that will 
in time give the art its due place: Meanwhile it

(Every child specialist is realizing the value of 
music as a due preparation for life. And-not the 
least of these, in the first few years of babyhood, 
is the effect of music upon the health. Pleasing

CHAPTER III 
WHEN IS A CHILD MUSICAL? 
Children are the representatives of intuitive 
Knowledge. 
—Dorothy Miller. 
(We have now reached the important age, from 
three to six years, when you can quite definitely 
determine how musical your child is. It is the 
kindergarten stage of music training, during 
which a great deal may and should be accom- 
plished. Still too young to ‘‘take lessons,’’ chil- 
dren of this age nevertheless are ready to learn 
a great deal about music. Instead of this being 
a rather barren period, quite void of results as 
far as appreciation goes, it is right here where 
you can rou can either make or unmake-the musical nature 
of your child. 
Few parents understand or believe that this may 
be the most important formative period in the 
child’s musical training. And furthermore they 
do not realize that they themselves can function. 
during this time as very successful teachers with- 
out the aid of technical knowledge. }‘‘I don’t play 
any more”’ or ‘‘I haven’t kept up my music” is 
the general plaint among mothers. 
To which one can truthfully answer: ‘Not: 
31 D yp
-P-A-G-E-31
32 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA. IN TUNE 
That doesn’t matter. There is still a great deal 
you can do.” / : : 
Every mother hopes her child will be ‘‘musi- 
cal,’’ but few mothers know that the hoping may be 
turned into fulfillment if only the right recipe is 
used. During these early years the thoughtful 
parent can play a larger part than anyone else 
in bringing this about. 
‘We have already seen that even in the nursery, 
_during the period of infancy, the child shows its 
musical tendencies, and it has been pointed out 
what may be done to develop them. But at best 
the mother’s or nurse’s réle during that stage of 
the child’s musical development is but a com- 
paratively passive one, and the child’s response 
is more instinctive than conscious. The tenden- 
cies are watched and permitted to develop almost 
undisturbed except for the gentlest of guidance. 
But now it is different. Again comes the anxious 
query: ‘‘When is a child musical?’’ 
‘We might parry the question, yankeewise, by 
asking another. 
What is a musical person anyway? 
Is it someone who has been especially gifted 
by the gods? Not at all, though that is the gen- 
erally accepted notion. It is an attribute that be- 
longs potentially to every one of us, for we are all 
responsive to melody and rhythm, There is a dif- 
ference only of degree. 
The mother who wants to find out the musical 
aptitude of her child must know, in the first place,
-P-A-G-E-32
WHEN IS A CHILD MUSICAL? 88, 
how to awaken this sleeping talent.. It is hoped 
that.a few practical suggestions offered here may 
throw: some light on the way to make home help 
in music study effective. 
Generally the mother whio feels. she. should have 
a more active share in her child’s musical educa- 
tion than is represented by engaging a. music 
teacher: and persuading father to foot the -bills, 
scarcely knows how to set about it... To be sure 
she tries conscientiously to instill a love for music 
by the various means at her command, such as 
playing the piano or some other instrument, sing- 
ing to her children, or having them listen to phono- 
graph records, or even taking them frequently, to 
concerts. 
All this. is sensible, inspiring and helpful, but 
it does not go to the root of the matter. It does 
not touch the fundamental principle that makes 
music the art most universal in its appeal.. Many 
a child fails to respond to these (for it) somewhat 
complicated: forms of appeal, and. is therefore set 
down as unmusical, when the case would . have 
been altogether different had this effort at de-. 
veloping. the music sense. been preceded by the 
right sort. of preparedness, a preparedness in 
regard to which most mothers need to be enlight- 
ened. : 
(The fact of the matter is that children, long’ 
before they arrive at the age of ‘‘taking lessons,’’ 
should be taught many things about music before
-P-A-G-E-33
34 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE’ 
the actual study of it begins. And it is at home 
where this can be done the best of all. Parents 
are mainly responsible for the musical awaken- 
ing of their offspring. 
It is important that the child, at this age, be 
not permitted to remain passive as far as his 
music is concerned. What he cannot share he has 
little interest in. But make him a partner in this 
musical game and see how he profits by it. As 
soon as he “helps,’? what joy he gets out of it. 
No child is willingly a passive listener.) — 
I am reminded of an amusing occurrence of a 
little three-year-old who thus had listening thrust 
upon her. It was Christmas day and the baby girl 
was much engrossed in making the acquaintance 
of her new doll and other toys, when this pleasant 
pastime was interrupted to ‘‘come and hear 
auntie play.’’ 
Now auntie happened to be a professional 
pianist, and she had carefully selected some of 
Debussy’s pieces from ‘‘The Children’s Corner’? 
as especially appropriate for. her youthful audi- 
ence. And they would have been had there been 
preparation for the musical onslaught. As it was, 
it was rather hard lines being required to leave 
your toys and the wonderful Christmas tree and’ 
everything just to hear someone play the piano. 
But our little Miss Dutiful obeyed the summons, 
pulled her tiny chair near the piano, and. while 
‘‘anntie”’ played, listened gravely—for about two
-P-A-G-E-34
WHEN IS A CHILD MUSICAL? 357 
minutes, then got up and with an air of sophisti- 
cated politeness saying ‘‘You play very well,” 
Auntie,’’ ran back to the exciting playthings. 
To make listening a duty is bound to. seem irk- 
some to the child, tiresome, dull, stupid. The | 
little one is not in the confidence of the performer. 
Very soon, were such a mode of procedure per- 
sisted in, he would become downright ‘“‘unmusi- . 
cal,’’ destined ultimately to join that vast army 
of ‘‘can’t-tell-one-tune-from-another’’ persons. 
A too well-meaning mother of my acquaintance 
made just this mistake with her four-year-old boy. 
She was a musically educated woman who had per- 
fectly ironclad theories regarding everything 
under the sun, including her boy’s musical educa- 
tion. He was musical. Why, of course! Wasn’t’ 
he her son? So that settled that. 
So with his fourth birthday the time had 
arrived for him to begin to ‘‘like music.”? There 
had been no loving pr ation beforehand, no 
appeal through the wonderful play spirit in music, 
no sympathetic attitude toward his baby leanings 
towards music. That was all nonsense, of course. 
He had consequently learned to toot vociferously, 
to drum a continuous din, and generally to bang 
his way along childhood’s path when suddenly— 
suddenly, mind you, came a change. He was to 
sit quietly in the parlor for fifteen minutés at a 
certain time each day, while mother played for 
him beautiful music on the piano.
-P-A-G-E-35
36 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
Was it beautiful music to that small boy? In- 
deed no! His frowning face, his uneasy squitm- 
ings, and his eager ‘‘Mamma, can I go now?” all, 
showed the trend of his mind. He liked that daily 
music dose about as much as castor oil, but-it 
didn’t do him as much good. Undoubtedly both 
were catalogued in his youthful brain as things 
_to be carefully avoided ‘‘when I grow to be a big 
man.’’ 
‘That boy was undoubtedly innately musical. 
By inheritance he should have been especially so. 
But giving him musical food which he could not 
digest not only failed to arouse his interest but 
turned his passive indifference into active dis- 
like, The appeal of the preceding chapter that the 
music instinct should be carefully nurtured. may 
be repeated here and even more strongly empha- 
sized.. And again and always make your young 
person your partner in your musical under- 
takings. 
Material for musical illustrations is to be found 
on all sides—right at your elbow, if you wish. 
There, for instance, are the water glasses on your 
breakfast table—one of the best musical instru- 
ments you can find. With a fork give a short 
quick tap to a glass partly filled with water. It 
will give a pleasant sound. Fill it full, the tone 
will be lower. Empty it, and its song will now 
be pitched much higher. Tap another glass, its 
sound will be different. Range several glasses in

line, and with varying amounts of seater you will , 
get.quite a variety of tones. : : 
Now you may begin to ask the child to co-. 
6perate after the first attention is secured. Ask 
him. to imitate the sound of a single tap by singing 
it. Although only a tiny tot, he will try eagerly, 
and you will be surprised to find -how. the ability

can .touch upon the fundamental principles. of 
pitch and tone quality (tone-color), thereby laying 
the foundation for other amazing possibilities. 
The further development of the sense of pitch 
and.tone quality will be the subject of succeeding
-P-A-G-E-37
ae 38 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
chapters. The subject matter given here is to be 
used:as a start in the important phase of music 
sense development that must come in these early 
years. : 
Music study, even when it comes to the way 
music is made, may be so enticing that we might 
call it baiting tunes with sugarplums. And if the 
curious signs and funny symbols that make music 
visible are not exactly sugarplums at least you 
will agree, if you know them well, that they are 
something quite as desirable. There are several 
good books dealing with basic music material 
that are especially adapted for this home music 
study. By judicious selection any mother can find 
an easy and delightful way to tell Tommy and 
_Jean all about notes, and time, and clefs, and 
staffs, and everything else that belongs to the writ- 
ing of music. The teaching of the fundamentals 
of music should always be madé attractive. 
{The entire aim of modern music teaching—and 
this concerns the mother as vitally as the teacher 
—lies in letting musical symbols reveal them- 
selves through their self-evident functions. They 
should not be in the way of a child’s enjoyment 
of music, but simply its tools.) A small black- 
board in the nursery would be a great help with 
a music staff painted on it—or two staffs. And 
then proceed to tell your story, bit by bit as the 
days pass. Children will absorb a surprising ~ 
amount of knowledge in this way, and if rightly

administered it will simply wet their appetite for 
more. . : 
As a further step the time has now arrived for 
simple music stories. An anecdote of a famous 
composer’s childhood whose piece you have just 
heard on the phonograph, or that mother has 
played on the piano, will serve to supply a new 
angle of interest. Children like simple, healthy 
tunes, and they like stories. Learn to correlate 
them. You will be surprised to find how ‘easy it 
is to do this. Besides it is one of the ways to 
make music in the home not only a study but a 
real pastime. 
Here then is the mother’s task determined for 
her. There are delightfully illustrated books 
ready to aid the work, and all sorts of devices for 
making home-help in music study reach its best 
efficiency. If mother has not ‘‘kept up”? her music 
then now is her big chance to come back. Home 
preparation, the creating of a musical atmosphere 
calculated to meet childish needs, will do wonders 
in developing your child’s appreciation of music. 
In his later life it will become one of his dearest 
possessions, but he only truly possesses it for 
whom the beginning was made in childhood. 
Try then to teach your children the secrets that 
lie in musical sounds, the fascination of different _ 
tone-colors, the pulsating contagion of rhythm. 
In the process do you believe you will discover 
your child to be musical? Just try it and see! -

—Rabdindranath Tagore. 
We have seen in a general way how very impor- 
tant these kindergarten years are in your child’s 
musical development. It has also been pointed 
out how large the mother’s share in this develop- 
ment may be even without any real technical’ 
knowledge. The lines to be followed—they ‘were’ 
merely suggested in the preceding chapter—will 
be indicated more definitely here. ™ 
We are concerned in a very practical manner

help rests- almost exclusively with the mother. 
The day of the professional teacher and the time 
for the formal ceremony; of ‘‘taking .lessons’’ 
have not yet arrived. 
Meanwhile let us see what the child is s doing. 
A. small beginning has been made .to develop 2 
sense of pitch and of tone quality. Simple little 
songs are sung to him and with him... But aside 
from this rather general training of the’ njusic 
sense there are two elements entering into the 
process that are of sufficient importance, to be 
‘ given special attention. These are the appeal to

music does not mean merely folding your hands 
- and listening to a melody. It means hearing all
-P-A-G-E-41
42 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
the lovely things that music actually says to us— 
and that can only be accomplished by practice, i 
other words, by learning to be selective listenors D 
Learning to open our ears is as much a matter 
of training as anything else. Let us see what 
Tommy can hear when he shuts his eyes and you 
tap on one of those water glasses. Will he know 
what you are tapping? Now rap on the table. 
Does it make as pleasant a sound? Tap the arm 
of a chair (if it is of wood) and back to the table. 
Is one sound higher or lower—up or down? Tap 
gently a bit of metal or stone in the room. Does 
this sound like the wood tappings? Play a musi- 
cal note on the glass again. Then on the piano, 
if you have a piano, or on the xylophone. Rap on 
the window pane. 
This may readily be turned into an amusing 
guessing game with the faculty for distinguishing 
the difference in pitch and quality growing more 
acute every time it is tried. 
But very possibly you are not a city flat-dweller 
with only the park to go to for an outing. If the 
great out-of-doors is right before you, then indeed 
a whole new world of music is open to you and 
your children, and all the marvels that comprise 
the rainbow beauty of tone color are placed before 
you for your pleasure and appreciation. So out 
you go into your garden, and begin to listen. 
“But it’s all still and quiet’’ the child will say. 
But after a moment: ‘‘Oh! I hear a bird!’ Anq@

then will gradually come the consciousness of 
other sounds—queer busy insects singing, maybe 
* leaves rustling, or there may be the tinkle, tinkle, 
of a brook of running water. Nature is a whole 
orchestra if only we will learn to hear its mes- 
sage, A process very similar to the one conducted 
indoors may be carried on here. Which sounds 
are more musical (or pleasant) than others? Is 
this one higher or lower than another? Can you 
sing it? The rainbow beauty of tone color is only 
fully appreciated by those whose ears are open. 
Appreciation of it gives a new meaning to music. 
}~ This ear training through a variety of sounds 
should be done only a little at a time, and always 
as nearly as possible by way of entertainment. 
Never let the play spirit of music get out of your 
sight. Now you can begin to correlate the bird 
song you hear in the garden or through the open 
window with simple songs about birds. Let the 
child learn such a song. Play bird-song or bird- 
call records on your phonograph. 
As for the notation symbols of music, with the: 
aid of suitable material any mother can teach her 
child all about ‘‘notes’’ and ‘‘time.’? . It must 
_be done gradually, and always with copious illis- 
trations. In this, as in everything else pertaining 
to the development of the music sense, let the 
child be active, not passive. Make him a part of 
the game. 
King Harmony and Queen Melody, who together
-P-A-G-E-43
44 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
rule in Musicland, are far too often surrounded 
by dreadful bugaboos in the shape of dry, tire- 
some, unexplained exercises that make the king 
and queen just sit stoically on their thrones, with- 
out the least bit of human interest for anyone. 
So they remain very stiff and haughty. But how 
gloriously resplendent King Harmony and Queen 
Melody become when all their power and beauty 
are revealed. You see they like to be courted and 
flattered and enticed and pleased, and this all the 
lovely and queer and interesting things that go 
to make up our music can do so well if they are 
but given a chance to show their real selves, 
Many typical music games planned for class 
teaching in the kindergarten cannot be. easily 
applied to the home teaching campaign. But any 
mother knows or can learn the few notes of the 
seale, c, d, e, f; g, a, b, c, and the corresponding: 
syllable names, do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do. Instead 
of a class you have at home, we will say, two 
youngsters near enough of an age so you can do 
a music game with them. (Of course the game 
can be played with only one child too.) Children 
and mother seat themselves about a table on which 
are eight blocks selected from Tommy’s assort- 
ment—six the same size and the two Do’s larger. 
* Or you may just cut squares of cardboard for the 
purpose. In that’ case they can be marked by 
their letter and syllable names.

and has no musical instrument, a secure guide: 
You are now ready to practice building the.scale. 
The squares (or blocks) are divided among the 
players. You call for Do.. Do must’answer by 
appearing on the table and being sung too. Re is 
ealled for, etc., until the scale is built. 9... - 
Something of this sort can be played often until 
the actual building of the scale.is an old story. 
Now have three or four sets of your ‘syllable 
names cut into pasteboard squares with your Do 
always larger because you are now going to com- 
mence building melodies. The safest way-to begin 
your melody is with Do. You see he happens to 
be a very important person indeed in the music 
game. After Do is out on the table the next player 
has his turn for calling the melody note, and after 
him the next player until you have a song of at 
least eight or nine notes all finished. Now let each 
player in turn try to sing what the combined com: 
pany has written. Of course this union-made 
music may not turn out to be an inspired compo- 
sition but it is fun and it brings music at once 
close to the little people. “j 
Let us imagine the following melody: For in-

* 46 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE: + 
stance Do, Mi, Sol, Mi, Fa, Re, Do, Do, Do. There 
they all are in a row. A nice little song to sing 
especially if you make the last three Do’s longer 
than the rest of the notes. Mother can‘attach 
words if she likes. ‘‘Ob, how sun-ny is the day.’’ 
Or ‘‘Birdie likes to fly a-way,’’ or anything else 
‘that comes to mind. | Encourage the children by 
all means to make their own songs and if their 
first attempts do not conform to the rhythm, be 
sure and.point out what is lacking. Make your 
own song definite. Every child must be a creator 
if the music sense is to be properly stimulated. 
This may all sound very much like regular 
kindergarten teaching and it is, but it is quite 
within the reach of any mother to carry on this 
amount of preparation at home. And it can read- 
ily be seen that when the time comes for more 
formal music study, the child so prepared is in an 
infinitely better position to profit by the teaching 
than one who does not know how to listen. 
Children are imitative. They will learn certain 
little songs telling about birds, or flowers, or sun- 
shine, or rain. And they will like them. More- 
over they will soon hear the basie difference be- 
tween what is bright and gay and what is dark 
and sad. And by a very little judicious gnidance - 
they learn to associate gaiety with quickness in 
and something sad with slower, deeper tones. 
The creative instinct begins to assert itself very 
early and with a surprising definiteness. Now is
-P-A-G-E-46
APPHAL TO THE IMAGINATION AT 
the time to encourage the child to set down his own 
ideas, thoughts, and experiences in music. He 
soon finds that music is a wonderful language of 
tones in which almost anything may be described. 
Sometimes a child will express a single thought 
by a simple phrase, indicating a strong individual- _ 
ity. Just as frequently the recital of an entire 
story is ventured upon. All this is just a step 
further away from the funny little chants baby 
hums to himself while he sits on the floor of the 
nursery and is busy at play. 
A case in point where a child sets out to tell quite 
a complicated story is that of a little girl who had 
already shown considerable aptitude in this direc- 
tion. She surprised her mother one day with a 
complete narrative. Her ‘‘piece?’ had the cheer- . 
ing title, ‘‘The Horse is Dead.’’ And there she 
~ had it in her music—the impression made by 
watching a horse jogging along until it fell in the 
street. There came a wild but futile struggle, 
spasms of energy that grew weaker and farther 
apart, and finally utter helplessness and ‘‘the 
horse is dead.’’ The music told every bit of the 
story—the rhythmic jogging, the fall, the strug- 
gle, and the quiet end. It was a photograph in 
tones. ; 
But aside from the idea that their little original 
efforts can tell a story, music is good for oh! so 
many other wonderful things. Chief among these 
is the development of the tone sense by phrases or
-P-A-G-E-47
48 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
musical sentences and their general characteris- 
tics. Here is a piece by Debussy called ‘‘ Dancing 
Snow,’’ and just listen! It does actually sound 
just about like the gambols of the millions of tiny 
white flakes as they come dancing down to earth, 
bumping into each other on the way like so many 
white imps. 
And when you listen to Chopin’s “Raindrop”? 
prelude, can you not shut your eyes and imagine 
you are hearing the pat, pat, of the rain on the 
roof? And still another very obvious nature 
piece is Rive-King’s ‘‘Bubbling Spring.’’ 
These examples are mentioned simply in the 
nature of hints. If you have a player piano or a 
phonograph, get rolls or records dealing with 
nature subjects, or play them yourself on ‘the 
piano. And itis not too soon to begin, even at this 
early age, to teach the youngsters that when some 
one is playing for their entertainment they must 
listen quietly, that it is impolite and even rude to 
talk. This is an entirely different matter from 
the example in an earlier chapter where a small 
boy was made to attend to his mother’s playing 
without being told anything about music before- 
hand. The idea was that he was to absorb it like 
a sponge, and the unnatural procedure very natur- 
ally failed to work. But learning to listen, ad- 
ministered in proper doses is easy. Concert 
manners are as necessary in the home as in publie 
gatherings.
-P-A-G-E-48
- APPEAL TO THE IMAGINATION _ 2 / 
In these ways children begin to find out that 
music can mean something in the abstract. A too 
photographic adherence to ‘‘story’? in music 
hampers the imagination, or rather, guides it only 
in a certain sense. We must always bear in mind 
that all truly great music pictures moods and emo- 
tions, and only rarely, photographs. : 
In the process of developing the tone sense, 
children will be found to have a predeliction for 
certain tone qualities over others. They like the 
xylophone with its clear tinkle, the flute, and 
stringed instruments especially. 
Not in many households are a variety of instru- 
ments available but there is one that should be in 
every home, in addition to the ubiquitous piano, 
and that is the phonograph. Comparatively few 
phonograph owners of the millions of people who 
have them realize the manifold possibilities of this 
mechanical reproduction of music. They read the 
advertisements telling them that practically all 
the great music in the world is reproduced for 
them here, and then they go and buy their favorite 
John McCormack record and the latest jazz, and 
eonsider their duty done. 
Now there is nothing to be said against buying 
atiy or all of golden-voiced John’s records, and 
at the other end of the pole, jazz has its rightful 
though limited space too. But there is a world 
of music in between that should not be overlooked. 
In the meanwhile we are not ready yet to take
-P-A-G-E-49
ea 50 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
up the question of home repertoire, but’ we are _ 
ready to find out more about training Young 
America’s sense of tone-color. 
Symphony orchestras are not available except- 
ing in a few cities, and even so it is only in New 
York, and Chicago, up to the present time, (1920), 
that orchestral concerts for children have been. 
attempted and given successfully with explana- 
tions about the compositions. Moreover these are 
intended for children of public school age and our 
tiny tots are scarcely ready for these concerts even 
if they live where they can get to them. 
But records have now been made for a great 
variety of instruments, and if you will ask your 
local dealer to send for the educational record 
list you will find there the different instruments 
nicely catalogued. Only a few simple records of 
the flute (something birdlike) or the piccolo or 
the drum would be liked by the very young chil- 
dren, but it is a suggestion for the way in which 
the home campaign for good music can be con- 
ducted later. Start right now. Training the 
music sense can never begin too soon. 
In this early training of the tone sense it is 
important, too, to avoid harsh and discordant 
sounds. Be careful in the kind of toys you give 
your children. You might just as well give them 
something pleasant to play on as something ear- 
splitting. A drum is better than a shrill whistle, 
or if your small! boy must blow, get him a jewsharp

or a small fife. The xylophone again is brought 
forward as an important adjunct of the nursery 
-and play room. With a padded stick it makes a 
pleasant musical sound. It is just as great fun . 
as any kind of a discordant musicbox in the shape 
of a “‘play’’ piano, and far better for your child’s 
musical development. As has been pointed out 
before, it is inexpensive, too, the smallest costing” 
only about four dollars. It has.a tone quality 
children love. 
All of this time you have been teaching the child 
to realize that music is everywhere—not just. 
imprisoned in the wooden box of piano or phono- 
graph. And you have taken the first steps to 
prove to your child and yourself (for parents — 
need to be educated along these lines too) that 
learning about music may become just a fascinat- . 
ing game. Its object may be entirely educational, 
but it functions as much more than that; and much 
of this ‘‘more’’ is embodied in the appeal to the 
imagination. : 
And so it is up to the parents, and the mother 
especially, to guide her young hopeful on his 
musical way.. The imagination of the child, 
always easily touched, finds in this journey 
through music land as much to marvel at as ever 
did Alice in Wonderland. Here in this Wonder- 
land are to be found rainbow-hued tone colors, 
wildly contagious rhythms, and beautiful melo- 
dies. And by giving your child the golden key

called ‘‘Liking Music’’ you open to him the door

cessive year of his life.

DEVELOPING THE RHYTHMIC SENSE 
And in their first learning of notes they shall., 
be taught the great purpose of music. 
—Ruskin. 
_ The play of imagination in music is seldom . 
quite ‘free from the rhythmic element. In fact it 
might be’ roughly stated that it is the combination 
of the two that makes musical sounds ‘and music. 
And it is not only in formal musical composition 
. that this is true, but the law of time, of persistent 
iteration of a definite pattern, is the fundamental 
characteristic of all musical sounds in nature. Tt 
is only noise—the Bolshevik in the’ world’ of 
sonnd—that apparently knows no law. 
We.all know how regular a bird-call is and how 
individual. And what more accurate pattern of 
sound could you ask for than the song of the 
whippoorwill, the katydid’s alternating ‘‘Katy 
Did’’ and ‘‘Katy Didn’t,’’ the cricket’s chirp, or 
even the bull frog’s basso profundo? Law. and 
order in nature everywhere. 
The persistent repetition of the same musical 
figure is what first excites our attention, then, 
secondly, makes us familiar with the tune so: that 
particular song comes to be connected with — 
53 
Ne
-P-A-G-E-53
~ 5 
54 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE | 
certain familiar creatures, and even bespeaks 
definite nature moods, like the robin’s ‘‘Rain 
Song.’”’ 
This system of law and order indulged in by 
nature’s orchestra very naturally carries over 
into man’s first attempt at articulate emotional 
expression. Primitive man soon found thgt to 
make his grunts or his cries take on meaning 
they had to attain individual character, so that 
they might be differentiated from each other. So 
his short phrases of sound gradually emerged into 
the pattern state until primitive speech—and 
similarly primitive ‘‘music’’—took on the quality 
of an interminable repetition as the most marked 
of.its characteristics. : 
Here is a favorite song of the natives of New 
South Wales in Australia:

DEVELOPING THE RHYTHMIC SENSE 55 
Beautiful, isn’t it? At least you will admit 
that it is a distinct time pattern. After several - 
‘ repetitions on a given pitch the chant is trans- 
ferred in toto to the next lower tone and 80 it goes. 
on for almost an eternity. 
With savages their beginnings of music were. 
always accompanied by gesture, and considering 
the monotony and limited range of their music 
expression it is not surprising that gesture was 
needed to make it intelligible. As civilization 
progressed, the spontaneous expression of human 
feelings through music developed into the folk 
song, and the true folk song was almost invari- 
ably an action song. | 
This translation of the folk spirit in music is 
accurately reflected in the play of our children. 
All childish pastimes in the way of games are 
governed by time laws. The rhythmic pattern is 
everywhere in evidence. They skip rope to a 
regular beat, clap hands in time to familiar jingles, 
sing songs in regular time, hop, skip, jump, and 
make up words to accompany certain activities, 
all of them with a regular rotation of accent. 
Wherever a group gathers rhythm obtrudes itself. 
Even the boy who goes whistling down the street 
alone with a stick in his hand, will whack at pass- 
ing objects on a regular time schedule. 
This rhythmic expression is, of course, entirely 
spontaneous and evidently necessary to the satis- 
faction of an innate sense and desire. Without
-P-A-G-E-55
oe 
56 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
regularity expressive movement loses its mean- 
ing—becomes expressionless. It does not carry. 
And while neither savages or children know. this 
or reason about it, they instinctively obey this hid- 
den law that governs all emotional expressien 
indulged in for an ulterior end. 
If we need any further proof that rhythmic 
expression is the answer to an inner law, we need 
merely note the contagious effect of rhythm. . It 
invariably sets up an impulse to imitate, to. go 
along with it, even as the small boy trails the mili- 
tary band and keeps in touch with its martial 
music. And not only he but every grown. up 
within ear shot does the same thing, the only dif- 
ference being that the grown up child obeys the 
impulse: somewhat sheepishly, and often even 
breaks the contagious circle by refusing to ohey 
it, although it is only with a wrench that: this is 
accomplished. 
Meanwhile what is the psychological effect of 
that stirring band music? Does it make for 
slouchiness of carriage, for a shambling walk, or 
anything that speaks of ill directed energy?. Cer- 
tainly not. The boy who obeys the impulse*.it 
creates walks with head erect, shoulders thrown 
back, a firm step, and energy galvanizing every 
limb. Followed long enough it awakens ambition, 
brings dreams of power, breeds incipient success. 
Some of the psychological effects of rhythms.as 
applied to household problems will be touched
-P-A-G-E-56
DEVELOPING THE RHYTHMIC SENSE Bu 
upon in a later chapter. What concerns us more 
directly now is the usefulness of .rhythm: when’ 
properly applied to the development of ‘the miusie : 
sense in the child. 
It has already been noted that the baby: will 
imitate a rhythmic tapping ‘on: the table long 
before he can sense a melody, and so it is but 
natural that this innate feeling ‘for ‘rhythm 
responds most heartily to a demonstration of ‘it’ 
in nursery rhymes and jingles and tunes: °:": 
Falling back on dear Old Mother Goose—what 
would we do without her?—these familiar jingles 
lend themselves very naturally to musical treat- 
' ment. They have been placed in innumerable: 
settings, and any mother can get some of these 
through her local music dealer. and play. them‘ on 
the piano. Or they can be had in phonograph ree: 
ords and even player piano rolls. ‘The desirable 
way in.any case, to get the child’s codpeération, is 
to make him an active partner in doing these songs’ 
and rhythmic games. ‘That is just it. They must 
be done, not merely sung. That passive listening 
process is to be carefully avoided, excepting for 
the rare occasions when a piece bya famous ¢com- 
poser is to ‘‘entertain’’ the nursery-habitues. In 
such instances—it has already been emphasized— 
it is most desirable to impress with the fact that 
the ‘‘polite person’? listens quietly to music made 
for his entertainment, just as he must Histen to 
anyone talking to him. 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
68 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
Let tis take a conerete example by way of illus-_ 
trating what can be done with one of these action 
songs. For. instance you are concerned for the 
moment with a lively march. If mother plays it 
herself on the piano, and the family consists of 
only one child, then mother can count the time 
out loud, and get Jean or Tommy to march around 
the room in time to the music. Play at ‘‘High- 
stepping Horses,’’ or ‘‘Brave Soldier,’’ or any- 
thing. that will make it definitely a game. When 
the first step is accomplished, let the small boy 
march along clapping his hands together on the 
first beat. Perhaps sister is there and will accent 
' the beat by a tap on her xylophone. . 
If the mother is alone in this teaching: game a 
phonograph is an invaluable aid for it leaves her 
free to suggest and play with the children.. Every- 
one likes to beat time and children are so suscep- 
tible to impressions that they catch and follow any 
simple rhythm very easily. Learning to keep time 
can also. be done by tapping with a ruler or pencil 
or little stick on the table. There are many differ- 
ent ways of doing just this one simple thing that 
will readily suggest themselves to any resource- 
ful mother. While developing your child’s imag- 
ination do not neglect your own. 
‘While we have been busily discussing the 
aesthetic value to the child we have almost over- 
looked one of the most beneficial results of the 
‘development of the rhythmic sense and that is a
-P-A-G-E-58
DEVELOPING THE RHYTHMIC SENSE - 59 
purely physical one—the -effect on the child's 
be ch and his bodily grace. 
While the mother at home cannot without due” 
study and technical knowledge carry this idea. 
very far, there is nevertheless opportunity right 
at home to develop this phase of physical expres- 
sion. Rhythmic movements are almost always 
graceful, for the fact of being engrossed with 
rhythm frees the child from ‘a natural awkward- 
ness. Grace of body, improvement in carriage, 
with their attendant good effects on the general 
health, are the result. In fact grave physical 
defects and ailments have been cured through 
such exercises. But to obtain curative results for 
a physical disability the child must, of course, be 
placed in care of a teacher who has made a thor- 
ough study of this. 
Music is a wonderful stimulus to any kind of. 
physical training, as it is infinitely easier to go 
through any drill with the urge of rhythmic 
melody weaving its magic spell. 
While the bodily motion in time to a tune makes 
the sense of rhythm more acute, the carrying out 
of the action by way of illustrating the words is 
going a considerable step further. (the child 
swaying his little body while he sings of the wind 
swaying the branches of the trees becomes at 
once a creator. He is virtually making the song 
all over again and living it himself. ) His sense of 
spontaneous musical expression having not yet
-P-A-G-E-59
60 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
been educated into a self conscious nothingtiess, 
he naturally loves to sing, and it is easy for him 
to associate the words with the right expressive 
action and the music. 
It now lies. with the mother to bring into this 
teaching as much of beauty as she can. The.cor- 
nerstone of the love for beautiful things, including. 
music, must be laid in childhood. Therefore it is 
of the utmost importance to make the music atmos- 
phere you are creating in the home consistent with 
itself. See to,it that your children learn.to know 
the best. Having come to know it they will love

The time is now ripe to.commence the process 
of ‘learning to like’’ works by famous composers. 
Compositions having direct melodies and strongly 
marked characteristics, either in rhythm or in a 
descriptive sense, should be used for. these first 
home concerts. By the judicious first training in 
which the child is made to distinguish sounds in 
nature, and something of individual tone qualities 
(actually tone colors) this followed by the right 
beginnings in music itself, the child has new 
reached the point where the action songs, *the

DEVELOPING THE RHYTHMIC SENSE “61 
rhythmic drills and the tone sense exercises: may’ 
safely be interspersed with oceasional episodes of 
passive listening. ee 
. All the beautiful things they know children will 
find paralleled in music. All their. experiences 
are here reflected, somewhere, somehow. : Such - 
pieces as ‘‘The Happy Farmer’’ by Schumann, 
“Simple Confession’? by Thome, ‘‘The Anvil 
Chorus’? from ‘‘Il Trovatore’’ by. Verdi are 
examples.of melodious. pieces that-children enjoy. 
A full list of music for the home repertoire:-will be 
given in the last chapter. All such music may be 
obtained as records or player rolls or in arrange- 
ments for piano, violin or other instruments. : 
In collecting your phonograph library.it is 
quite.as important for the sake of the youngsters 
in the family. as well as the older people: that the 
collection be as carefully watched as the piano 
‘ rack. The music in the home should be good but 
always. easily likable. Again..you must be 
reminded here that appreciation of music maust 
not be exposed to a forcing process. fe 
In connection with a composition by a famous 
composer it is most useful to tell something about 
the man who made the music, and of course the 
title should be explained too, if it does not tell its 
own story. Some mothers have even undertaken 
with success to gather together a group of chil- 
dren in the neighborhood once a week for a very 
special music playtime. Then indeed all the pos-
-P-A-G-E-61
62 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
sible music games, such as the tone-guessing 
game, singing and action games, and regular 
music-lesson games, like the building-melody 
games, described in the previous chapter, can 
become of exceeding usefulness. 
Can one doubt the value of this introduction to 
music under the right auspices? The develop- 
ment of the music sense depends absolutely on 
_ these earliest impressions. Bugaboos and tire- 
some tasks must be side stepped. Sensible 
methods must be substituted. 
And the finest thing about it all is that the 
mother, even without any practical training and 
technical knowledge, can open a whole new world 
to the child. The sound-world is quite as wonder- 
ful as the world we see, and yet nearly all of us 
are quite deaf to its infinite variety. Learning to 
hear means opening an additional world of beauty 
to the soul of a little child. Instinctively music is 
welcomed by the budding intelligence for all it 
has to give of soothing harmonies and stimulating- 
rhythms. A child surrounded by good music from 
its infancy learns to like it as naturally as it 
learns to speak. And once rooted in the child 
heart it will blossom into a flower of happiness 
’ that will be the richest heritage your child can 
possess.

Now we have arrived at the stage when ‘‘taking 
music lessons’’ is conceived to be a necessary 
factor in every child’s education. It is. Only it 
is rather appalling to see how much misdirected 
effort, money, talent, and energy have been wasted 
in this direction. : 
There are two reasons for this: wrong method: 
of instruction, and lack of preparedness in the 
home. Perversely we shall take up the last point 
first. 
Lack of preparedness has much to account for 
becanse to it is the fact that many potential 
musicians never come into their own. And by the - 
word ‘‘thusicians’’ as used here, the professional 
music-maker is not necessarily referred to, but 
rather just that regular human being who was 
born with the love of music in his heart but whose 
: 63
-P-A-G-E-63
64 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
natural instincts in this direction became killed 
through’ neglect and lack of exercise. 
Now your child is such a potential musician to 
whom you naturally wish to give every advantage. 
So the question uppermost in your mind now is: 
At what age shall my child begin music lessons ? 
And by “music lessons’’ the reference is almost 
invariably to the piano. Even where the study of 
another instrument is contemplated, some study 
of the piano should come first. 
If the child is well and strong, six years of age 
is the time to begin, or as soon after that as pos- 
sible. And get the best teacher you can find— 
never mind the expense. Banish the thought that 
‘almost any teacher’? will do for a beginning. 
The right teaching is more important then than 
at any other time. You know what happens to 
the young sapling that is not made to grow 
straight from the first. 
The harm done by careless or - incompetent 
teaching is not confined to a waste of energy, pos- 
sible talent and money—although all these are 
precious enough in themselves—but its most costly 
result lies in the stultifying of the music sense. 
It is quite as easy to turn out music haters as 
music lovers, and the antiquated ideas that pre- 
vailed (and unhappily still prevail to a large ex- 
tent) regarding the teaching of music, were the 
_ most prolific breeders of music haters one could 
possibly imagine.

TAKING LESSONS 65 
Look about you at the number of persons who. 
“took music’? in their youth. How many have 
“kept it up,’”? or are now apparently lovers of 
music? Very few indeed, in fact a woefully small 
percentage, in view of the fact that ‘‘taking 
music’’ at some time in our lives is an almost 
universal penalty. Yes, penalty is right. Even 
if you éan point out a few bright and shining 
examples of really musical persons who retained 
that much desired attribute in spite of mistaken 
pedagogic notions through which they fought their 
way, their ultimate triumph but emphasizes the 
rarity of the occurrence. Do any of us need to 
be reminded of the hemi-demi-semi-quaver method 
of our youth? Can we ever forget the hours of 
toil dragged out in weary attempt to capture the 
enigma of minor scales, or to solve the obstinate 
vagaries of ‘‘time’’? 
And then there was your thumb! It just - 
wouldn’t go under the right finger. With sheer ob- 
stinacy it floundered about with all the grace of a 
fish ont of water, and was quite as unmanageable.

rote,’’ didn’t you, with a lot of meaningless do-re- 
mi-fa’s thrown in that .rose up and smote you

become a part of our cultural existence, is ‘reborn 
the desire to know something about it. And this 
desire is most frequently embodied in the familiar 
remark ‘‘I wish my mother had made me prac- 
tice!l’?, Do you realize that in most cases 
‘“‘mother’’ did? That she used all the persuasive 
means in her power from bribes to punishment, 
according to her individual light? Mother did, 
. You may be sure, until her patience and father’s 
purse gave out. Then daughter’s music was 
stalled half way down the road to anywhere, re- 
maining but a fitfully flickering accomplishment 
of a sort that gives more pain than pleasure. 
Has it ever occurred to you that when you view 
at maturity the ruins of what was once intended 
for a musical education, instead of saying ‘‘T 
wish niy mother had made me practice’? you 
should say ‘‘I wish my music teacher had had 
_ some sense’’? Mother, you must remember, had 
the patience, mother was eager to help, mother

was ambitious for you, and you may rest assured 
she worked harder in her tender watchfulness to 
make a musician out of you than did either you or 
your benighted teacher. But how could mother 
be expected to know that the expert was at fault, — 
and that there must be some real reason, quite 
outside of music itself, that made you so hate to 
practice? 
Yes, that is the calamity, The child dislikes. 
the practice hour, must be driven to it. And the 
most natural course of reasoning to follow (and 
this is followed by most parents) is that if the 
child dislikes to practice, he must be unmusical. 
This is not true. The child dislikes to practice 
because he is not being taught in the right way. 
The inner mind of the greater part of the vast 
army of music teachers seems to be a solid phalanx 
of black notes arranged into exercises. These 
. Meaningless arrangements of notes that in them- 
selve have no good reason for being are thrust. 
upon the child with the admonition that they are 
good for him—that without practicing them he 
cannot learn to play. They are to be done so and 
so many times, and must not on any account be 
neglected for the more pleasant ‘‘piece.’’ 
- It is at the door of this fetish, the mechanical 
exercise, that so many musical deaths must be 
laid. Nothing so easily dulls the interest, finally 
causing an actual loathing as the senseless repeti- 
tion of a dry and useless task. It gets the pupil

nowhere, but. takes the edge off his interest even 
if it does not completely exterminate his ambi- 
tion. And worst of all it does not help his playing. 
Once more, if there are those who come through 
the antequated methods with flying colors, it is in 
spite of them, not because of them. 
You ask why it is that such wrong ideas have 
been permitted to dominate the teaching of music? 
Because the beauty of the art was lost sight of in 
the contemplation of technical proficiency. The 
mechanics of music became the end and aim with 
the interpretative values left to shift for them- 
selves. Moreover there has been no standard of 
teaching possible.. Anyone who wants to do so 
can teach music. There is no law to stop him. 
And to such a one (and to many of greater knowl- 
edge) music is just so many black notes! No 
wonder the object of such a method learns to dis- 
like music and later in life avoids it as he would 
the influenza. . 
The old-fashioned idea about music study made 
of it a deadly serious business. It was supposed 
and expected to be tiresome, dull, uninteresting. 
The object. was to learn certain set ‘‘pieces”’ that 
could be played. -The showing-off notion was for- 
ever kept in the foreground, and was indulged. in 
on every possible occasion, much to the politely 
concealed distress of the listeners. There was a 
_ definite cut and dried method. All children were 
subjected to the same process. So and so much
-P-A-G-E-68
TAKING LESSONS 69 
of this, such and such a time for that. If every- 
thing. went all right, in due time a musician 
(heaven save the mark!) was manufactured. He 
was union-made, a replica of all those who had 
gone before, and with all the individuality crushed 
out of him. 
Now all this is being changed. Psychology has 
come to the aid of music teaching as it has come 
to other branches of pedagogics. And there is 
besides, an awakened sense of the beauty as well as 
the usefulness of the art. Music study is no longer 
considered by progressive educators as simply a 
frill, an accomplishment. It being accepted as a 
first-class mind-trainer, and as a practical and 
cultural factor in the general educational scheme. 
And with these progressive ideas the music pro- 
fessor is rapidly falling into line. 
The up-to-date teacher, with modern ideas and 
a new knowledge, teaches music, not notes, and 
live children, not automatons. The kind of 
musical bent is considered, and the potential talent 
is brought from hiding where neglect had rele- 
gated it, and made to show what it can do. The . 
most unmusical on the surface is perhaps the liv- | 
ing receptacle of hidden fires. One backward 
pupil, with tender watchfulness, sometimes be- 
comes a star. The work assigned is cut out to 
meet individual needs. And above all the bean- 
ties of tone-color, or rhythm, or character in 
music, is made clear.
-P-A-G-E-69
70 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE i. 
All the undesirable elements of hackneyed 
methods are becoming properly unpopular. The 
new ways are bringing results that are not only 
infinitely better than the old ways, but much © 
quicker. (Though not too quick!) 
Children know more about real music now after 
six months’ study than many of their elders have 
ever known: That is because music study is no 
longer a bugbear but a delight, an educational 
pastime instead of an abhorred task. These new 
ways have sincerity of purpose and thorough 
knowledge behind them. Every step is logically 
prepared. Every new group of facts is presented 
at the right psychological moment. There is no 
senseless leaping forward into the unknown, no 
contradiction of terms and reasons. From the 
very beginning the child is taught to think music 
and to feel its beauty. 
The big, helpful, transforming influence of the 
art is finally coming into its own.. Our. children 
are exposed to very different treatment from the 
semi-quaver days of our youth. Notes are being 
relegated to. where they belong as symbols, and 
symbols only, .‘‘Time’’ and ‘“‘beats’’ and ‘‘signs’?’ 
are no longer permitted to usurp the thought of 
the child as though they. made the music, when it 
is music that has made them. And so the rocky 
road of music study is being made smooth. The 
path is finally being cleared for the real beauty 
of the art and its almost uncanny potency.
-P-A-G-E-70
TAKING LESSONS “71 
To primitive man music was a wondrous thing 
emanating from a supernatural source, a gift of 
the gods, holding within itself a strange mysteri- 
ous power. And that power, to which we vibrate 
with varying degrees of responsiveness, it felt by 
all. Only the child, like the primitive man, is 
touched even more readily than its elders. 
The aim of the modern teacher is.to forget the 
obvious complexities of musical symbols, simply 
letting them reveal to us the direct’ message of 
music which is, after all, their self-evident func- 
tion. The ‘‘new’’ way of teaching music takes | 
into consideration the instinct for rhythm and 
the feeling for tune. Hven the color blind can 
see outline and object. Even the tone deaf can 
sense many definite gradations of pitch. ‘‘The up 
and downness is so exciting!’’ one little girl 
exclaimed after she had eagerly sung the melody 
exercise just placed upon the board. And she was 
only one of many profiting by progressive methods 
of teaching. 
Thought and care go into the scientifically 
planned study whereby the maximum of result is 
attained with the minimum of effort, and the study | 
path is so strewn with roses that the eager, ques- 
tioning child mind is held and fascinated. In 
other words the new way is bringing happiness 
where formerly there was only drudgery, and the 
number of music lovers being grown promises a 
bumper crop. After all, learning about music—
-P-A-G-E-71
712 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
if it is presented properly—is one of the easiest 
things our children do. / 
And in all of this the mother can help wonder- 
fully. ‘While the actual practice should be ad- 
hered to strictly according to the lines laid down 
by the teacher, the musical atmosphere created in 
the home will do much to further development. 
The child must ‘‘get its music lesson’? but any 
other music entering into its life (if judiciously 
guided) will be a help, not a hindrance. The child 
should. be encouraged to play with the piano—to 
look upon the instrument as a friend. By trying 
some of mother’s music lying on top of the piano 
there is an added stimulus in finding new fields to 
conquer. Arid any such spontaneous playing 
around will make for a greater love of music than 
if every ‘note but the prescribed lesson is forbid- 
den. It is up to the mother to see to it that the 
lessons are properly prepared and that time spent 
otherwise with music be in due proportion.

CHAPTER VII 
DELINQUENT PARENTS 
If parents would remember that upon the first 
lessons rests nearly everything, the sending of 
impressionable minds to teachers without a stan- 
dard of educational value would cease. And how 
it would weed out the teachers! 
—P. Carl Whitmer. 
We have already seen that to cultivate musical . 
taste the beginning should be made in infancy. 
The time to start the development of the music 
sense actually does begin with the mother’s first 
lullaby, of all the songs of occupation the most 
beautiful. It has also been pointed out that an 
amazing amount of musical preparedness may be 
done—and the musical millennium will have 
arrived when it is done—throughout the first six 
years, or until the time for ‘‘taking lessons’’ 
arrives. The benefits resulting from awakening 
the listening sense, from unstopping little deaf 
ears, from appealing to the imagination, all these 
will bring in an accrued income on which the only 
tax will be a more developed personality. 
And one of the main objects of this discussion 
is to prove to parents that they have an obliga- 
tion to fulfill as important as any for which they, 
as parents, are responsible. - 
There is no reason why the home training 
. 73
-P-A-G-E-73
74. PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
should be entirely transferred to the shoulders 
of the specialist when he is engaged as a teacher 
and the properly trained parent who, up to the 
time of engaging a teacher has been trying to 
spread the gospel of melody in the household, 
is not likely to lay down that activity with the 
advent of formal study. But unfortunately very 
few parents, up to now, realize the value of this 
formative musical period, and while they may try 
to make up for their neglect later on their very 
natural tendency is to let the teacher do it. 
Now .we will assume for the moment that this 
is your attitude, but that you are fortunately in, 
a position to engage a well-equipped progressive 
teacher who is acquainted with modern methods 
and practices them. You arrange for the time the 
lessons are to be given, the matter of price and 
the terms of payment are agreed upon, father is 
notified of his share in the proceedings, which 
means paying the bill, and then at 4 o’clock Tues- 
days and Fridays, for a space of thirty minutes 
six-year-old Jeanie is to be given music. ~ 
Has it occurred to you what an insurmountable 
task you are setting even the best teacher in the 
world? During that half hour time must be found 
to explain something of the symbols by which 
music is made visible to us, the mysteries of time 
and accent (rhythm) must be gone into, the key- 
board of the piano must become as an open book, 
the child must be taught to hear, to learn the
-P-A-G-E-74
DELINQUENT PARENTS 1 
meaning of music, why and when music is fast or 
slow, something of the general character of the 
piece being studied, and enough of information 
about the man or woman who wrote it to create 
interest there. ; 
Not only the practice time but the way to prac- 
tice (more important than the amount of time) 
must be gone into. And all this must be done with 
so much zeal, so much of live determination and 
sensible equipment that the young mind will catch - 
the impetus of the inspiration to such an extent 
that it will carry over and through the interven- 
ing days. After all you are demanding quite a 
little of teacher are you not? 
Now the worst of it is that in the vast majority 
of cases the mother explains that she would pre- 
fer to have Jeanie take only one lesson a week. 
“T don’t want her to work too hard,’’ and then, 
too, there may be a question of finances. 
When you realize the many-sidedness of the 
music study problem, is it any wonder that there 
are such miles of failures to one success? Or that 
so many do not ‘‘seem to get on’’ until finally the 
stimulus of the initial interests changes into in- 
difference and nitimately, in many cases, into ac- 
tive dislike? Lack of proper progress is discourag- 
ing alike to pupil and parent. Finally after five 
or six years of a desultory pursuit of the will-o’- 
the-wisp of musical excellence, the entire thing 
is given up as a bad job. ‘‘Jeanie likes to hear
-P-A-G-E-75
16 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
music but she never liked to practice.” Poor 
Jeanie! Poor teacher! Poor mother! And do we 
hear a sort of basso profundo echo, Poor father! 
For it is Dad who in all probability has paid the 
bills. 
Now the most appalling phase of all this is that 
Dad’s outlay in dollars and cents represents only 
a fraction of the wasted expenditure. And what 
has gone into the maw of futile effort is some- 
thing more precious than money. They are energy, 
' ambition, perversion of talent, your child’s right 
to niusic, and her ability to enter this unseen world 
of beauty. The child’s instinctive music sense has 
been weakened and possibly actually killed by this 
unintentional but nevertheless serious neglect. - 
It is but natural to blame the teacher for the 
inevitable result, and yet even if the instruetor 
represents the best of his class, the result. is very™ 
apt to be just -what has been indicated here. How 
much more likely then, that apparently unmusical 
. humans will be the result of teaching that is not 
'_ the best, or even half way good. Unhappily the 
chew and broader vision that is revolutionizing the 
teaching of music is only fairly started in its fight 
to overthrow the strongly entrenched methods of 
a former generation. 
The cumbersome, inefficient, uphill way, paved. 
with good intentions to be sure, but strewn with 
the dead stones of meaningless exercises and un- 
alloyed dullness, is still much in the ascendancy.
-P-A-G-E-76
DELINQUENT PARENTS 7 
Pedantic textbook knowledge still proudly waves 
its banner even in the face of the inroads made 
by progressive ideas that have called applied 
psychology to the rescue. Teaching music, in the 
eyes of the vast majority, still consists of notes 
and beats. There are only a few who are daring 
to substitute for these tone and beauty. 
But whether the teaching is good or bad, the 
active codperation of the parents, and probably 
especially the mother, is not only desirable but 
necessary if worth while results are to be attained. 
Here is a responsibility that cannot and should 
not be turned over to the teacher. You should 
know, to the best of your ability, how and what 
your child is being taught. The mother, if she 
does not want to be set down as a delinquent par- 
ent, will try to be present when the lesson is given, 
and even if she has not kept up her own playing 
she nevertheless can follow easily the general 
course pursued by the teacher. 
For another thing the child’s practice should 
_ be supervised as closely as possible that the ing 
tervals between lessons may be employed to good 
advantage. This is of great importance for the 
more intelligently the child practices the more 
rapid will be the progress, and progress brings 
contentment of spirit and joy in the doing. 
But there. is another side to the shield. The 
parent’s desire for progress should not lead to 
direct or indirect interference with the teacher’s
-P-A-G-E-77
18 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
plans. The familiar flower of the showing-off 
spirit generally manifests itself about the time of 
the second lesson. ‘‘How. soon can Tommy have 
a piece?’”? And Tommy, big-eyed, looks at his 
teacher-fate and eloquently though silently sec- 
onds the implied plea. 
Now if the teacher is weak-kneed, he succumbs 
to the wishes of the fond parent and the carefully 
laid plan of study is given the first blow. With 
this precedent established, other evasions soon fol- 
low, and it is only later that the folly of the too 
supple specialist is revealed. This interference 
by parents is no idle tale. It is happening right 
along and plays havoc at every turn. 
What the teacher should have is codperation, 
not interference. But how can the parent be help- 
ful without becoming acquainted with the details 
of the music teacher’s plans and ideas of work? 
Pigeonholding your child’s education by labeling 
» these hours at school or with a governess, those 
hours for exercise, and such and such hours for 
music, may imply a systematic arrangement, but 
it is not particularly sympathetic. Yn the homes 
where many social duties relegate the child’s ac- 
tivities largely to the guidance of teachers or 
servants, the neglect by parents of the most essen- 
tial element in the child’s development—that of 
sympathetic help—is frequently appalling. 
I am reminded of a recent occurrence in the 
leading music store of one of our largest cities. 4
-P-A-G-E-78
DELINQUENT PARENTS 79 
. 
At one of the counters sat a very well dressed 
alert young woman of twenty-eight or thirty, read- 
ing a book, A few minutes earlier she had given 
a clerk a slip of paper with the admonition, 
‘Please fill this.’? Evidently the long list was 
a musical prescription. It had been made out 
by a well known and very successful teacher. 
Among other things the list called for a key- 
board chart, one of the several devices now in 
use for making clear the composition of the piano 
keyboard. 
Presently the clerk returned with several dif- 
ferent charts and disturbed this very modern 
young mother at her reading. ‘‘Which one of 
these do you want, Madam?”’ 
Impatiently the customer looked up from her 
book, glanced at the charts unseeingly, and ex- 
claimed, ‘‘Why, I don’t know anything about it. 
This list was made out by my little girl’s music 
teacher. Put it together the way. you think best 
and don’t bother me with it.’’ 
This was letting teacher do it with a vengeance. 
It showed an utter Jack of interest in this phase of 
the little daughter’s education and development, 
and was a distinctly unsympathetic attitude. And 
yet this parent would be highly incensed at being 
placed in the delinquent class. ‘‘Why! we do 
everything for our little girl. Give her the best 
teachers and the best of care!’’ 
That is all very well, but in the development of
-P-A-G-E-79
80 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
the music sense there is something very precious 
and very. tender that must be nurtured by love 
and sympathy if it is to grow into the beautiful 
flower of music appreciation later in life. 
’ Another very common delinquency on the part 
of parents concerns most especially that omni- — 
present household utility, the piano. No other 
piece of furniture in the home is so mistreated. 
A sort of step-child of the. household gods, one 
would imagine, for it seems that anything is good 
enough for it. It is placed near an open door or a 
steam radiator or a thin outside wall where the 
alternating heat and cold play havoc with its 
insides. All sorts of coverings are permitted with 
a view to enhancing its charms to the eye, although 
‘they muffle the tone and interfere with its song. 
Various objects ornament its top and then beat 
‘a kind of accompanying tatoo whenever the piano 
is played. | 
But worst of all the inside works are allowed to 
deteriorate for lack of the proper attention. It is 
only when the poor decrepid thing is so far run 
down that its condition is pitiable, that the piano 
doctor, otherwise the tuner, is called in to do his 
worst. 
The admonition to keep the piano in tune which 
went with its sale was promptly forgotten or con- 
sidered unnecessary. And the family ear was not 
acutely enough attuned to pitch-to hear when it 
began to get out of tune. So probably the tuner is
-P-A-G-E-80
~ DELINQUENT PARENTS gl * 
not called in until the abused box of ivories cries 
out in agony, sending out an s. 0. s. signal in the 
form of a rattle. Then the tuner comes and fixes 
it up as best he can, but in the meanwhile, if the 
neglect has covered a considerable period, a 
deterioration has taken place that is beyond 
repair. 
Few ‘people realize that to permit a piano to 
stand out of tune results in a real injury to its 
quality. And furthermore when a piano is badly 
out of tune, the strings will not hold when they are 
pulled up again to the proper pitch. <A piano, 
to give the best service and have the longest life, 
should be tuned four times a year. Then it will 
act like one of the family instead of like a dis- 
graced step-child, and will reward you by good 
‘behaviour. 
Another item. Having an instrument out of 
tune in the home spoils your sense of hearing 
music. It demoralizes your ear for music. You 
and your family become so accustomed to the in- 
harmonious tinkle that you actually are not aware 
of its disagreeable effect. This is directly harm- 
ful to that development of the music sense which 
we are talking about. 
These then area few hints which the fond 
parent, with or without technical knowledge, can 
use in order to be an active partner in the child’s 
music study. Intelligent and sympathetic codpera- 
tion, ranging from non-interference to keeping the
-P-A-G-E-81
82 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
piano tuned, will turn into a well paying invest- 
ment the money spent for music lessons, and will 
~ lift the parent out of the delinquent class into that 
_ of a first aider.

CHAPTER VIII 
IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Every well-trained youth and girl ought to be 
taught the elements of music early and accurately. 
" —Ruskin. : 
In order to continue the journey of the child’s 
musical education we must leave the home training 
for a time and consider what is going on-in our 
public schools. A.story of remarkable progress 
we shall find there. But like all good things it 
has had to fight for its present position, and is 
still fighting. . 
Not so very long ago quite a well-known edu- 
cator stated in a book (on high school studies) 
that ‘‘musie is still a doubtful member of the 
academic family.’’ And this old-fogy idea of his 
is still shared by an overwhelming number of 
school men who have not concerned themselves 
with the harmonious revolution that has gone on 
about them. Because music didn’t count for any- 
thing in their school days, they are sleepily abid- 
ing by their own experience, instead of opening 
their eyes to the present day status of music and 
the modern methods of teaching. 
(it is almost impossible to think what our public 
( schools would be like without tausic, its part is so 
\essential ‘and beautiful. And in those first early 
. 83
-P-A-G-E-83
84 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
days at school, in the lower primary grades or in 
the kindergarten—how much music means then! 
The game-songs are such fun, and they do so 
help you to get acquainted and make friends, and 
take the edge off the strangeness and awsomeness 
of it all. They help mightily, and the memory of 
them constitutes a sunshiny background through 
all the school days ome. Yes, and after the 
school days, too! 
(The inclusion of music in the school curriculum 
as an educative factor of the first importance is 
nothing new. Only its present day application 
is new. The Greeks recognized and preached the 
value of music. ‘‘It is the essence of law and order 
and leads to all that is good’’ said Plato. ‘‘Musie 
is one of the best mjnd-trainers,’’ say our modern 
educators. And Dr. P. P. Claxton, Commissioner 
of the National Bureau of Education, says: 
‘“After the beginnings of reading, writing, arith- 
metic and geometry, music has greater practical 
value than any other subject taught in the 
schools.’? | 
But meanwhile, as was pointed out before, in 
the school-room music has had to fight for its life. 
Unthinkingly it was set down as a frill, a pastime, 
an educative fifth wheel. All very pleasant, per- 
haps, but. of no real practical value. And the 
impetus so thoughtlessly set in motion gained 
force and weight until it has taken a real cam- 
paign for musical righteousness to bring the tune-
-P-A-G-E-84

ful art back into the educational scheme where 
the Greeks of old, in all their wisdom, first 
:placed it.) 
All the way down the road and back again we 
have come, until finally it was raised to the dig- — 
nity of the ‘‘Three R’s,’’ and today the new 
algebraic symbol for rudimentary education is 3 
R’s + M. The view that ‘‘anybody can teach 
music”’ is long dead. Instead of being an added 
~ function placed upon the already burdened shoul- 
ders of the school teacher for the purpose of 
‘interpolating a bit of relaxation from the arduous 
mental labors of the three R’s, music is now being 
taught by highly specialized teachers. who have 
been duly prepared for the work, and the study 
has gained correspondingly in importance and 
value. , 
Modern music methods are demolishing the 
old-time mechanical training that spent its time 
anxiously over the cataclysmic difference between 
-F sharp and G flat, but had no time for the mes- 
sage of beauty and emotional reaction that is the 
true function of music. All this is being changed, 
and music is being used to develop perception, to 
train the memory, to stimulate the imagination, 
to encourage concentration. It brings poise and 
confidence to the backward pupil, it makes the 
alert one reach out to the limit of his capacity. 
In the right hands it can be made the most pleas- 
ant and unifying element in school life. And best
-P-A-G-E-85
86 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
of all, its beneficent influence will not stop with 
the slamming of the school door, but will con- 
tinue to exert its helpfulness throughout all the 
years of one’s life. 
The subject is one entirely too big to permit of 
exhaustive treatment here, but I shall try to point 
out briefly a few of the outstanding advantages 
of modern methods as applied to public school 
music, and to show what progressive teachers are 
doing that gives music the right to be included as 
one of the Big Four in the educational scheme 
to which we subject our children. 
Here is a room full of tomorrow’s citizens, 
gathered from all kinds of homes. It is the first 
day of the new school year. They are youngsters 
ready to’ start in ‘‘first year’’ or even at the kin- 
dergarten stage. Here are musical children and 
‘‘gnmusical’’? ones. Those who can carry almost 
any clearly defined tune. Those who can’t carry 
any at all. 
What shall we do with them? Is it wise to fol- 
low the accepted notion that those who do not 
carry a tune are incapable of it? Shall these be 
gathered under the heading of ‘‘monotones’’ and 
not be permitted to join in the class singing? 
This is a question answered variously; but the 
most progressive teachers of the caliber of Agnes 
C. Heath, at the head of the school supervisors in 
the public schools of Chicago, and the willing 
workers under her, take the stand that the child
-P-A-G-E-86
in, IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS 87 
actually incapable of following scale or interval 
progressions is almost an unheard of phenomenon. . 
- (Pupils are placed under three groups. “Those 
- who can follow a tune, those who waver and are 
‘ equally likely to go right or wrong, and those 
whose rhythmic and oral sense still need awaken- - 
ing. By urging the lagging ones to join in, even 
if they don’t get it right, by encouragement of 
their efforts and by relieving them of self con- 
sciousness, the fight is in itself almost always won 
right there. This spirit of getting together, en- 
tirely aside from the effect it has on the child’s 
vocal development, brings us at once face to face 
with one of the wider aspects of music education. 
The resultant training brings poise, self expres-

rily in class singing the. child becomes the 
song. It is a personal act he is performing. He — 
is now a creator, and as such, takes pride in what 
he is doing and experiences the joy of accomplish- 
ment. Is it any wonder that, under such training, 
the music hour passes all too swiftly? ) 
Music study makes for alertness. Let us take 
up this point. By way of illustration we may 
consider -a typical kinderband.. Here is a room 
full of mere babies with wide open, eager eyes — 
watching ‘‘teacher.’? They have been in the pub- 
lie school kindergarten only two weeks. They are      
  standing in a circle, four with ‘‘nightingale’’

whistles, six with tambourines, several with tri- 
angles, one with a bell, four others with a sort of 
beating rattle, one young gentleman proudly 
manipulating a drum, and another fairly bursting 
with importance as he stands alert for the signal 
to clash his cymbals. 
Alertness is certainly the key-nute. Every 
little body is fairly tense with the earnestness with * 
which they follow their task. There they stand’ 
in a circle, with teacher in the center beating time, 
while the accompanist plays a few measures of 
introduction. Every eye is glued on the waving 
hand, watching for the signal to begin, and—there 
they go! Right on the dot! They know that they 
must play on the accented beats and away they 
go, without a hitch, every small person there a 
bunch of concentrated energy. A slight gesture, 
and the tambourines suspend activities, and the 
bird whistles likewise, the rattles too, and only 
the triangles and cymbals, the drum and bell, keep 
on. Then these also, all except the bell, get the 
desist signal, and the young lady of the bell plays. 
asolo. Proud? Dear me, do you really expect me - 
to put it into words? 
Presently they lay down their instrument, 
group themselves near the piano, and from this 
rhythmic instrumental training change over into 
suitable little songs. Is it not natural that the 
practice in keeping time should percolate into 
their singing too? They sing softly, musically.
-P-A-G-E-88
IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS 89 . 
No loud, shrill voices are heard here, or permitted. 
But they sing with a smile on their faces and they ” 
tell of birds and flowers or the wind or Jack Frost. 
And liking the songs, and knowing and loving the 
things they sing about, they naturally learn to use 
a diction that many an older vocalist should envy. 
Because it means so much to them they put their 
little hearts into the music and it ‘‘goes over’? in 
a manner that many a trained singer is too self 
conscious to accomplish. 
e mental discipline gained from music study 
is not confined to alertness and: concentration. 
There is perception, too, somewhat related to both, 
and which is sharpened by the several faculties 
here brought into playd It has been proved again 
and again that the best music students stand 
highest in their other studies. An interesting 
case in point is the evidence of Dr. J. Varley 
Robberts, of Oxford University, England. 
Dr. Robberts, like many other educators, found 
great difficulty in having music entered as a regu- 
lar study in the university. But once accom- 
plished, he records from his. observations extend- 
ing over thirty years, that while only ten per cent 
of the student body had been exposing themselves: 
to music tuition at the university, seventy-five per 
cent of the scholarship honors of the entire univer- 
sity have been won by this ten per cent group. — 
We are going back to our more primitive fore- 
fathers for many ideas, and one of them is a mod--

ern application of the action song. Folk songs © 
were long ago always done with action, and now 
this intnitive form of musical expression is being 
_ introduced into our school-rooms, stimulating at 
once both interest and imagination. For instance, 
_ you should hear several hundred youngsters sing 
with a vim a song like ‘‘I’ve Come to See Miss 
Jennia Jones,’’ after which general introduction 
the various accomplishments of Miss Jones, such 
as washing, baking, sewing, knitting, are enthusi- 
astically set forth by words and tune and rhythmic 
movements. This makes for grace of body and 
for self control. 
“Tn addition to formally prescribed material, 
progressive and well-equipped teachers are using 
much material of their own by means of which 
their work becomes individualized. In the early 
grades they are making up jingles, set to succes- 
sive tones of the scale, so that scale-singing be- 
comes an easy and always pleasurable task, and 
incidentally—quite incidentally—the scales are 
learned almost without trying. And it’s not even 
a sugar-coated pill. It simply is no pill at all! 
And so the fundamental material that goes into 
the making of music is learned right along with 
an appreciation of its beauty, and through it all 
the greatest care is taken of the voice. The tones 
are\pleasant and well placed. Different syllabic 
sounds bring control of production and it is all. 
done sensibly. By the time the third grade is

reached the eight and nine-year-olds can write - 
any rhythm on the board with chalk strokes as the 
teacher sings the song, and their action-songs as 
well as just their singing-songs have taken on a 
great variety. Later they are able to write 
original melodies, to read in several parts readily, 
and always to sing with dynamic shadings that 
sincerely express their reactions to the music. 
The children are urged to put expression into 
their faces, to sing with their eyes, as it were, and 
although there are youngsters who occasionally 
overdo the facial singing, with the majority it 
becomes just another natural way to express the 
meaning of music. And it is to be hoped that this, 
training carried over into the adult choruses of 
the next generation will make them less stolid 
looking than the repressed groups of present day 
humans who can sing anything from a humorous 
ditty to ‘‘Glory Hallelujah!’’ without change of 
countenance. This attitude that modern train- 
ing requires from its devotees is a means towards 
self-expression without which no art interpreta- 
tion can be'effective. And it is an attitude in 
which we, as a people, stand in great need. Our 
tendency to repression of emotional feeling is bad 
for art. Our progress is measured by the extent 
to which we are breaking away from it. 
The fundamental taste of children is good, and 
this should by all means be catered to. The foolish 
notion that meaningless jingles and jingly music
-P-A-G-E-91
92 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
is all right for children, is absolutely wrong. 
‘Nothing but the best is good enough for them. 
But, of course, the music must be selected to suit 
their age as well as their good taste. Music with 
good, strong rhythms is what children like, and 
sound harmonies and sounder tunes. And for the 
younger ones it must be correspondingly simple. 
Singing is a valuable physical exercise, too. 
The children sit up straight when they sing, they 
learn to breathe deeply, thus strengthening their 
breathing apparatus, it quickens the circulation, 
and altogether acts like a real tonic. The good 
effect on health is also one of the beneficial results 
of the rhythmic work as carried into action-songs. 
Here there is bodily exercise of a health-giving 
kind which ean be carried over into folk dances and 
‘interpretative dancing. This phase of the music 
work has been one of the most valuable assets of 
the training given in at least one school for defec- 
tive children, and in some cases resulted in prac- 
tical cures, or at least in a surprising measure 
corrected their infirmities. , 
_ For the aid of the ‘appreciation’? work nothing 
, better could be found than the phonograph. For 
‘the development of the sense of tone-color and 
knowledge of orchestral instruments, records can 
be used’ by way of illustration. When a song is 
learned like the ‘“‘ Anvil Chorus”’ from ‘‘I] Trova- 
tore’’ the teacher will find time to tell a little story 
about Verdi, the composer, and during one of the
-P-A-G-E-92

music periods will play some records of other 
parts of the opera. The hitching-up method is 
invaluable for driving home information in such 
a way that it will stick. The practical use of the 
phonograph for purposes of music education is” 
of far-reaching possibilities, and up to the present 
the scope of its function has only been scratched 
on the surface. Not only every school but every | 
school-room in the United States should have a 
phonograph as well as a piano. The phonograph 
recommends itself both by reason of its compara- 
tive cheapness and the small space it. occupies. 
Its proper use can be a real inspiration. 
The bands in our public schools for ‘the little 
ones and the older boys and girls bring with them 
all the factors so valuable in rhythmic and vocal 
drills. There is pictured here one of the kinder- 
garten bands with a dignified youth wielding the 
baton. Note the attention. All kinds of instru-~ 
ments suitable for little people are in use, repre- 
senting various tone-colors, as well as a variety of 
musical effects. The late war having emphasized 
the importance of music in our national life, 
orchestras and bands are becoming a still bigger 
factor in our schools. In many cities the board of 
education appropriates at least some funds toward 
proper instruction in such instruments and pro-. 
vides some of the material needed. As a rule this 
is supplemented by the efforts of each school to 
raise additional funds. To facilitate class instruc-
-P-A-G-E-93
94 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
tion, music publishers are trying to meet the need 
by publishing suitable instruction books. 
In many families where there are several chil- 
dren, and particularly some boys, the study. of 
something besides the piano or violin is urged. 
The clarinet, the flute, ete., offer facility for much 
enjoyment, and excellent opportunity for playing 
’ with others, and it is that, as much as anything, 
that helps to make music a live factor in school and 
home life. 
As a further proof that music study is a social- 
izing influence, there is now being inaugurated 
over a wide territory an experiment of tremendous 
importance that promises correspondingly large 
returns. It is the introduction in our, public 
schools of music memory contests for pupils of 
the sixth, seventh and eighth grades for the pur- 
pose of familiarizing them with good music, its 
standards and its composers. A list of perhaps 
sixty compositions is selected by the music super- 
visor and the committee, and these compositions 
are explained, played and sung in the school-room 
during a certain number of weeks of preparation, 
until the pupils are thoroughly familiar with them. 
After a certain time a contest is held and the 
winners receive-prizes. Parents of the competing 
children naturally desire to supplement the train- 
ing for the contest received at school by further 
drilling at home. To this end player-piano rolls 
and phonograph records of the music on the list
-P-A-G-E-94
IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 95 
can be played, or other and original forms of the 
music may be performed. You can readily see 
how this stimulates interest, rivalry, and a con-~ 
tagious enthusiasm, with the result that at the 
close of the contest the children have learned to 
know, and what is more, to like a considerable 
library of ‘‘good’’ music, and from that on it is 
easy to continue the work of appreciation. These 
contests are a direct link with the private music 
lessons taken at home, and are aiding in erystal- 
lizing the fluid question of outside credits in 
music, a plan already placed on a working basis 
in several cities.* . 
‘he fundamental principle of all music study 
in the school-room, in the home, and in the indi- 
vidual music lesson, should be to make the study 
vital. It is not a question of teaching notes, or 
songs, or ‘‘pieces,’’ but of bringing into the lives 
of children the refining influence of an awakened 
sense of beauty. The old notion is dying out that 
education has for its purpose solely the discipline 
of the mind. Instead of giving information’ edu-— 
cation is assuming the infinitely greater function 
of developing in the individual the right kind of 
social behavior, of making him a better citizen. 
In our public schools we are making the Ameri- 
can of tomorrow, and no stronger Americanizing

CHAPTER IX 
LINKING UP WITH THE SCHOOL 
Hallo!—What?—-where, what can it be 
That strikes me so deliciously? 
I never in my life—what, no! 
That little tin-box playing so? 
; —Leigh Hunt. 
Yes, it is just a ‘‘tin-box,’’ or more accurately, 
perhaps, an attractive mahogany phonograph-box 
standing shyly in a corner that furnishes one of 
the strongest links between home music and school 
music. And this is said with no desire to dispar- : 
age that time honored family friend, the piano. 
The latter is almost everywhere and continues to 
radiate joy in millions of homes. And probably 
the time is not far off when there will be a musical 
instrument in every home. 
But nevertheless the piano is a mute, inglorious 
object in many domestic sanctums, simply because 
there is no one to-perform on it. Frequently 
enough it is subjected to a sort of heartless bang- 
ing, to be sure, but that kind of playing makes for 
deaf ears-rather than musical ones and the piano 
so treated is apt to be neglected in other ways. 
The tuner is far too seldom a visitor, and the 
piano, growing restive under the strain, takes it 
out on. the family by responding in a querulous 
voice that has lost both pitch and quality. 
97
-P-A-G-E-99
f 98 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN ‘TUNE 
Unmusical habits being as easy to acquire as 
any other undesirable ones, the family gets ‘‘used 
to’? the untuned piano while all the time their 
selective sense of hearing is gradually deteriorat- 
ing. .When the piano is tuned at last it sounds 
almost wrong. As a contrast an instrument that 
can be played by everyone at the push of a but- 
ton is a mighty convenient object, and the influ- 
ence of the phonograph has been one of the 
astounding musical changes of the last few years. 
In the previous chapter its place as well as that 
of the piano, was merely touched upon, but I be- 
lieve it was agreed that a phonograph in every 
school-room should be the rule. This might as 
‘well be applied to the home. 
There is nothing more desirable in the growth 
- of one’s musical development than to do it one’s 
self. Making music, whether by singing or play- 
ing, makes us for the time being creators, and 
that, probably, is the reason why we are happy 
when so occupied. And of all the phases of 
musical activity that of singing brings with it the 
greatest joy. Nowhere is this more noticeable 
than when a number of children are singing 
together, either in the class-room or in the larger 
assembly room or auditorium where a thousand. 
or more often join in one chorus. Therefore let. 
it be emphasized that the creating of music by 
doing it ourselves is of the greatest possible bene- 
fit. But there are times, in the school, and cor-
-P-A-G-E-100
LINKING UP WITH THE SCHOOL 99 
- respondingly, in the, home, when letting someone 
else or something else do it, is desirable. And 
here is where the phonograph with its ready made 
repertoire has its innings. 
‘““How can we help if. we have:no technical 
knowledge?” i is one of the questions uppermost 
in the minds of parents when approaching the 
subject of how to link up with school music. Here 
is music education of formidable. proportions 
being given our children by teachers especially 
prepared for this work. How can we, who are not 
musical at all, hope to compete with them? And 
the answer must be that it is just as easy now as 
it was in those years of earliest training when the 
same doubts arose. The codperation of the parents 
is. not only-desirable but necessary if the music - 
training of the school is to be wholly effective. 
Children are never happier than when they can 
carry home their latest achievement to show the 
fond parent what progress is being made. And 
since the spirit of the newer teaching in public 
school music is rooted in the socializing instinct, 
there is a constant urge to the children on the part 
of teachers to carry their music home. Not with 
the showing-off spirit rampant but with the ambi- ~ 
tion to bring joy to others. One of the questions 
frequently asked in the music hour at school is 
“How many of you children sing at home for 
your mothers?’’? Or possibly the question is 
varied to ‘‘father’’ or ‘‘the baby’ or even to “big
-P-A-G-E-101
100 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
brother.’’ In any case the large majority of hands 
in the class-room fly into the air at such a ques- 
tion, accompanied by a glance of eager pride. 
The mechanical music devices having equipped 
father and mother with a ready repertoire that can 
be extended to suit the taste and the need of every- 
one, parents are prepared to plunge fearlessly 
into the business of linking up with the school 
when it comes ‘to music. The subject by being 
made a study of vital interest, fills young minds 
with eager questions that are not always satisfac- 
torily answered in the classroom, or for which pos- 
sibly there is no time. These questions may be in 
relation to the songs the children sing, or some of 
the music they hear played during an apprecia- 
tion class. The teacher gives as much information 
as time permits, but there are many things crowd- 
ing every passing moment. 
So Johnny or Mary comes home full of enthusi- 
asm about ‘‘The Soldiers’ Chorus’? and it is 
asked for again on the phonograph. Of course it 
would be even nicer if mother or big sister could 
thunder it out on the piano, but the family with a 
repertoire at its finger tips is only a rare happen- 
ing. But everyone can have a record of it, so 
there it goes again and its enlivening rhythm tunes 
up the entire household. But Johnny wants to 
know something more about the piece: Has it a 
story? So the forehanded parent will bring out 
the book on opera with which every family should
-P-A-G-E-102
LINKING UP WITH THE SCHOOL © “101 
be equipped, and will read or tell the story of 
“‘Paust,”? the opera in which ‘The Soldiers’ 
Chorus”? oceurs. Then it will be easy to find some 
other records, too, that illustrate other parts of — 
the story, and so the music comes to have an added 
meaning. 
There are other ways to associate music with 
the general scheme of the child’s development. 
Here is a familiar Italian tune, for instance. The 
children love to sing it without knowing perhaps 
.that it is Italian. But mother might tell them a 
bit about the sunny land of orange blossoms and 
how the swarthy complexioned people of that fair 
country love music. That, too, will put a new zest 
into the singing of it. 
Father is very apt to be eonfronted by music 
questions that pertain to physics. Your boy is a 
member of the school orchestra. He is learning 
to play on a horn and he wants to know the prin- 
ciple of it—why it makes that kind of a sound. So 
out comes father’s long forgotten physics, and a 
lesson in acoustics is the order of the evening. 
The piano becomes the center for a million ques- _ 
tions, while sound vibrations, the idiosyncrasies 
of wire strings, and the mysteries of the sounding 
board are gone into and explained. Who can deny 
that father gets about as much out of this as the 
boy? And after all it is quite the same as giving 
a necded lift over a hard problem in algebra or 
geometry.
-P-A-G-E-103
102 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
The ramifications of music study are so wide- 
spread that they touch other interests at many 
points, and progressive teaching methods are 
widening this scope immensely. Aside from 
answering questions and trying to help along the 
appreciation of music by supplying outside infor- 
mation correlated to it, it is the duty of parents to 
acquaint themselves with what is going on in the 
schools. And this the -Parent-Teachers Associa- 
tions are doing, but there are many parents who 
as yet do not take any active part in such organiza- 
tions. 
Parents should visit classes and acquaint them- 
selves with the way the study is being conducted. 
The parents’ interest will bring improvement in 
those communities where that is needed, and it 
will either help the local board: of education in 
progressive undertakings, or will bring those 
about where they are still absent. Poor public 
school music is too costly. Even in these days of 
the H. C. L. it should be done away with as being 
beyond all the bounds of extravagance. Just see 
the toll it takes (very similar to that of inadequate 
private instruction) of time and energy and the 
dulling of ambition. Poor music teaching in the 
schools makes the subject itself abhorrent, and at 
the same time deprives the school life of one of 
its best influences. 
There is no other element in the educational 
' scheme that more directly acts on the child’s char-
-P-A-G-E-104
LINKING UP WITH THE SCHOOL’ 103 
acter. The socializing influence of music is almost 
beyond computing. And in school, as in the home, 
it exerts (when rightly conducted) a unifying and 
harmonizing spirit. Every important school 
furiction, every holiday has its special musie to 
which the parents may come and listen. Not only. 
single classes but often all the classes in a. city 
school of 1,500 or more children gather together 
for assembly singing. The school orchestra and 
special choruses of boys and girls add variety to 
the program of mass singing, and proud parents 
can acquaint themselves right there with what is 
being done or not done. 
In one southern state a certain ‘school chorus 
was so well trained that it traveled over a great 
part of the state one summer to sing at a series 
of state functions, and it was voted a huge suc- 
cess. This singing together in the school is the 
true foundation of the community singing which 
optimistic workers in this field hope may in time. 
deliver us from the seemingly inarticulate hond- 
‘age that to this day envelopes us. . 
Children are learning so well in the schools how 
to sing spontaneously and merely for the joy of 
it, that this training will undoubtedly bring with 
it a letting down of the barriers that unwittingly 
place a.damper on any such self-expression out- 
side of the school-room, whether indulged singly 
or in community. ‘‘Why,’’ it is asked, ‘‘after 
eight years of public school-music and perhaps
-P-A-G-E-105
104 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
some vocal lessons froma special teacher after- 
wards—why after all this is there no spontaneous 
singing about the house?’? Or at best, why is it 
confined to the strenuous efforts of the kitchen 
maid? 
Daughters with the many years of training are 
seemingly as helpless at musical self-expression 
as though they had no music in their souls. They 
ean sing certain songs in an accomplished man- 
ner, but seldom arrive at a degree of proficiency 
that does away with self-consciousness, and as for 
just singing about the house—that is something 
quite unheard of. It is all very well for Swedish 
Katie to sing in the kitchen, or for Sadie Africana 
to give voice to her gospel hymns, but to be so 
natural in the front of the house really does not 
seem quite decorous. 
Some such reasoning it must be that actuates 
the artificial attitude whereby instinctive self- 
expression is practically killed. And the older 
methods of public school music were right in 
league with this embalming process of the music 
spirit. It is only our children of the present who 
are being exposed to a more modern treatment. 
Just because of this it is of the first importance 
that we, on the outside of the school-room, keep 
up with the procession. 
Our youngsters today are learning that music is 
a wonderful vital thing, a something that is open- 
ing up to them a whole new world of beauty, and
-P-A-G-E-106
LINKING UP WITH THE SCHOOL 105 
best of all, that it is something with which to. 
bring joy into their own lives and the lives of 
others. This is an awakening that is bound to © 
bring with it an urge for expression that will 
result in singing, singing everywhere, for almost 
any provocation or occasion. 
“< After learning to reason,’’ says Ruskin, ‘“‘you © 
will learn to sing; for you will want to. There 
is so much reason for singing in this sweet world 
when one thinks rightly of it. . . . You will sing 
all along the road then.’” 
Yes, ‘‘singing along the road’ is the very 
spirit of spontaneity, of joy in the doing that is 
the underlying motive power by which our chil- 
dren like to burst into song. If we can learn to 
be as wise, as natural, and as spontaneous as our 
children, we shall sing ‘‘all along the road”’ too. 
The teaching material in the schools is of the 
best, and as children instinctively have good 
taste in music, they will carry this atmosphere into 
the home and then cultivate the parents too, and 
increase their capacity for intelligent enjoyment 
of music. 
The memory contests, mentioned in the preced- 
ing chapter, are putting father and mother on 
their mettle as nothing else could. Each child, in 
its study, either on player-piano, the phonograph, 
or some instrument it plays itself, will be eager to 
learn the list of compositions well enough to get 
into the ‘‘team”’ of its class, and from there into
-P-A-G-E-107
’ 
106 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
the ‘fteam’’ of the school, and you may be suré 
father and mother will be glad to help. Faith in 
our own is always a wonderful incentive to effort. 
Then when the time comes for the final public con- 
test, all the parents will be as eager as the chil- 
dren, and although they won’t ‘‘help guess,’” when 
the testing program is played, they will enjoy 
knowing what is going on, and the chances are in 
the months of preparation they have kept up with 
their offpsring in the matter of the sixty com- 
positions listed. So again there has been a gain, 
both for parent and child, and a linking up with 
the school. . 
The parent’s responsibility is just as great when 
it comes to codperating with the music study in 
the schools, as with the private lesson taken at 
home from a special teacher. The most signifi- 
cant aspects of music study are frequently the 
corelated ideas that open the child mind to the 
power and meaning of music, while at the same 
time stimulating the imagination. And it is the 
duty of the parent to be as nearly ready as possi- - 
ble for this work.

CHAPTER X 
WHAT ABOUT YOUR BOY? 
You are trying to make that boy into another 
you. One’s enough. 
~—Enverson. 
Parents are just beginning to learn that music 
study is not exclusively girls’ business, in spite. of 
the fact that there have always been individual 
boys who have been given lessons (especially 
‘piano) generally much against their will. As a 
tule the time and energy spent in this direction 
have been practically wasted, the reason being the 
psychological attitude of the youngster and his | 
parents. 
The chances are that dad—harking back to his 
own musicless days—looks with indifference upon 
Johnny’s musical education, while fond mamma 
thinks it a desirable pink tea accomplishment, and 
so insists upon it for that rather frivolous rea- 
son. The small boy himself is firmly convinced — 
that music is a matter for curls and petticoats, 
and secretly rebels at this feminine business. 
What wonder then that his music lesson is a bore 
rather than a delight and he periodically demands 
release. from this feminine thralldom until finally 
father steps in with his ‘‘I want my boy to be a a 
real man,’’ and the music lessons stop. 
107
-P-A-G-E-109
108 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
That has been the generally conceived notion. 
What more natural, then, that music should be 
_ looked upon as girls’ business exclusively, and 
that only rarely, where the boy’s urge for music 
has been strong enough to overcome prejudice, 
has it been looked upon with favor as a masculine 
accomplishment. This is still almost uniformly 
the attitude taken by parents, but the sane and 
constructive work in the public schools and the 
preaching of foremost educators and men of 
science is slowly changing all this. The old time 
prejudices are giving way before a new enlighten- 
ment with music gradually coming into its own 
as an integral part of the educational scheme. 
When a man like Edison, a keen, caleulating 
scientist, says that ‘‘the time is coming when 
music will play a more important part in the 
affairs of the world than books’’ it means some- 
thing. Music is being taken out of its petticoat 
environment, and is being asked to hold its head 
up as one of the chief mind-trainers worthy of a 
place side by side with reading, writing, arith- 
metic and geography. More than that, it not only 
supplies needful mental discipline, but affects the 
character, makes for good citizenship, and is con- 
sidered valuable for its socializing influence. 
Several of these points will be discussed con- 
siderably in detail in later chapters. For the time 
being we are especially interested in our boy and 
the definite problems of his music study.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR BOY? 109 
The public school music in its modern mani- 
festations is beginning to reach out and get your 
boy. Unconsciously he is looking to music not 
merely as a relaxation, but as .a worth-while study. 
Less than ten (one might almost say five) years 
ago, it was customary in the schools to begin to 
excuse boys from the music classes with the third 
and fourth grades, the number excused greatly in- 
creasing with each year, until only a small per- 
centage remained to add their changing quavers to 
the music of the upper grades and the high 
schools. 
Why was this? The fault lay with the methods 
of teaching, with the frill idea predominating. 
Slower to accept the laws of applied psychology 
than the exponents of other studies, music teach- 
ers suffered from their own antequated methods, 
but they are now making up for lost time, and as 
a consequence it is becoming a vital study. The 
boys now like it as well as the girls. There is no 
more of that shame-faced muddling along at some- 
thing that they would rather not do. All you 
need to do is to go into a seventh or eighth grade 
class, or in high schools, and see the shining eager- 
ness with which the boys—everyone of them—join 
in the lusty strains of ‘‘The Home Road’? and 
other songs like that. : 
There is just as much competition among the 
, masculine contingent as among the pigtail divi- 
sion, just as much joyous singing among the boys’
-P-A-G-E-111
110 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
glee clubs as among the girls’ choruses. The man 
of tomorrow feels the inspiration and the swing 
of rousing music, the rhythmic contagion of large 
numbers doing a thing well together. There are 
songs of patriotism, good rousing marching songs, 
songs with a wholesome (not sanctimonious) 
flavor. All these are good to feel and to know and 
to do. : 
The reaction of little children towards music is 
practically the same with boys and girls, up to the 
tenth year. Then their manner of response begins 
to diverge somewhat in the selection of instru- 
ments each prefers to play, and the kind of music 
that stimulates them the most. School bands and 
_orchestras are a splendid outlet for your boy’s 
growing sense of music, and it is incumbent upon 
parents to recognize this fact. The ‘‘do some- 
thing’’ spirit that makes your child a creator of 
music rather than a passive listener, is a spirit 
that should be encouraged in every possible way. 
Your boy wants to play in the school orchestra. 
Very well. Find out what instrument he would 
like to play. Usually there is a preponderance of 
violins. See the music director at the school. 
Have a talk with him regarding your boy’s musical 
bent. And then arrange, if you can, to have him 
study, if he will, some other instrument, say the 
clarinet or cornet, flute or even the oboe, if a 
teacher of these instruments is available. In any 
event encourage your boy in his musie making.
-P-A-G-E-112
WHAT ABOUT YOUR BOY? 111 
If he selects the flute for his quasi-artistic ven- 
ture, get flute records for your phonograph at 
home. Learn a little about it yoursell. Show that 
you like to hear your boy play. Probably mother 
or sister will attempt piano. accompaniments, and 
there will be the fun of doing things together at 
home. Then there will be the inspiration of play- 
ing with others in the school, of having a place in 
the big celebrations and special functions of the 
year, perhaps proudly marching behind the flag 
on some patriotic occasion. All this will make 
your boy happier and freer in his school life. - His 
enthusiasm, the more fun he gets out of it, will 
carry over into his music-making at home, and at 
suitable times it will become to him one of his 
dearest relaxations. 
Wouldn’t you rather have your boy playing his 
flute or his fiddle at home than surreptitiously 
shooting craps with a group of undesirable boys 
in some out of the way corner of the neighbor- 
hood? Now wouldn’t you? 
And the chances are what your boy is doing his 
chum is eager about too, and his chum’s chum, or 
otherwise your boy wouldn’t have cared about the 
music game in the first place. Now do you see 
how it all works out? And how, without anyone’s 
preaching’ about it, music is being lifted out of 
its apron-string niche and being classed as a 
‘manly relaxation and accomplishment? 
In the matter of selecting the instrument for
-P-A-G-E-113
112 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
your boy’s musical outlet, some care must be exer- 
cised. It is advisable to avoid the larger brass 
instruments, up to the age of sixteen, at least, 
owing to the fact that too much energy may be 
expended in the blowing. The ‘‘blow hard’? ten- 
dency can easily be overdone under the spur of 
sharp excitement and serious physical mishaps 
result. So at least this danger should be avoided 
as there are enough instruments that can fill the 
music need without any danger. The parent 
should consult a musical expert regarding the 
choice of instrument, always, however, conforming 
_as closely as possible to the boy’s special taste or 
talent. : 
There is no sense whatsoever in trying to ‘‘sex?? 
the arts. They are useful to men and women alike, 
and belong equally to both. It used to be that 
curious distinctions were made as to certain 
instruments. 
Queen Elizabeth and her ladies played upon the 
virginal, an instrument in vogue in Shakespeare’s 
time, much like a tiny piano key-board resting on 
a table. As this became a very popular accom- 
plishment with the fair sex, the descendant, the 
piano, came to be looked upon as belonging ex-. 
clusively to the feminine gender at least for the 
purposes of public performance. At Oxford Uni- 
_ versity in 1827 at a concert the first male pianist 
who had ever appeared there was received with 
hisses. You see the idea of a man playing the
-P-A-G-E-114
WHAT ABOUT YOUR BOY? 113 
piano was not considered good form. Similarly 
the violin, althongh a small and dainty instrument, 
was not considered suitable for a woman and it 
¢ was not until the middle of the nineteeth century 
that a woman violinist was even tolerated with 
anything like good grace. , 
Although these customs seem laughable to1 us 
now we might just as well try to get a bird’s-eye 
view of ourselves as we are today, just for the 
purposes of comparison. It is barely possible that- 
we should find just as unreasonable states of mind 
existing in the world about us today if we could 
stand off and look at ourselves in a truly unbiased 
fashion. In fact it is not only possible but very 
likely. 
Talk to ten men of your acquaintance the next 
time you meet them. Ask them if they want their 
boys to study music, and at least nine of them 
will flash back with ‘‘I should say not! I don’t 
want my boy to be a mollycoddle.’’ In fact the 
percentage of possible affirmatives is probably too 
large if we make it one out of ten. The chances 
are that one out of a hundred would be nearer 
right. 
And the root of all this lies in the father’s own 
musicless education. He argues pretty much 
along the lines of the man who has succeeded in 
life without a college education. Therefore a col- 
lege education is all nonsense. What was good 
enough for him is good enough for the boy, ete. | |
-P-A-G-E-115

Having had no music in his educational scheme 
also makes father look at the thing in the dubious 
light of an accomplishment—a non-essential, and 
without going into it at all, he thinks that a mean- 
ingless ta-ta-ta has a softening influence on a 
man. It has, but not in the sense in which he 
thinks it has. So it is tabooed as a mollycoddle 
business, and once more the beautiful art of music 
faces a prejudice which it must and will over- 
* come. 
And in the face of all this is the undeniable fact 
that men are more musical than women. Where 
jollity reigns, among men, they invariably burst 
into song. It is not only true of exuberant college 
boys who will sing their lungs hoarse, and wear 
their fingers sore strumming the harmless man- 
dolin or the innocent ukelele. It is just as true of 
‘‘ug old fellows’”’ if they get together where good- 
fellowship reigns. 
But can you imagine a group of young girls 
spontaneously bursting into song about a piano, 
and having the time of their lives doing it unless 
there are.some ‘‘unmusical’’ males present to urge 
them on? And can you, by the widest stretch of 
your mind’s eye, see a group of perfectly respect- 
able fifty-year-old ladies drop their work at a 
sewing circle, in order to sing? You cannot, and 
if by any chance you did find them doing it, you 
would think them crazy. 
Now the trouble with father is that he has never
-P-A-G-E-116
WHAT ABOUT YOUR BOY? . 115° 
grown up. He is still just a boy in his feelings 
and the way he shows them, and any woman who 
has ever loved a man knows this. So when he and’ 
his friends, who are just grown up boys too, get 
together, they act like boys if the meeting be one 
of relaxation, and that is where music comes into 
the program. Told that he is musical, dad will 
scoff at the idea, but he may add that ‘‘he knows 
what he likes.’? Exactly. 
And are you too one of that vast army of peo- 
ple who say they are ‘‘not musical’? but who 
‘“know what they like?’’ Probably you are. And 
have you ever stopped to think what you mean 
when you say So-and-So is ‘‘musical’’ or ‘‘not 
musica]??? Of course you haven’t, but without 
hesitation and with a complete avoidance of, 
analyzing the question, you will nevertheless 
promptly reply: ‘‘Why a musical person is one. 
who knows about music’’*—which is no answer at 
all. 
Just -as though studying music made one 
musical! It makes for a technical appreciation, 
to be sure, and it makes for a fuller understanding 
of the inside workings of the art—of how a piece 
is put together, or the particular style that this or 
that composer has developed into a sort of per- 
sonal label—all that the study of music brings 
with it, but more real appreciation (by which we 
actually mean enjoyment)—never! : 
Now of all the persons in the wide world who is
-P-A-G-E-117
116 _. PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
most sure of his supposedly unmusical ground, 
friend father is the worst. He vociferously ex- 
plains how he has no use for that classical stuff 
that seems to have no tune in it, and how in his 
few moments of relaxation he wants something 
light and airy to rest his tired brain. And all told 
he works hard, poor dear, to make out a good case 
for himself, though rarely deceiving anyone but 
himself while he’s doing it. 
Does Dad know, and do you know what sort of 
a person he and you would be if you both were 
really unmusical? It would mean that as you 
walked down the street and a band, perhaps of 
boys in blue or khaki, came along, blaringly . 
sounding ‘“‘The Stars and Stripes Forever’’ or 
“<Qver There’’ your pulse would not leap to meet 
the music, nor would you fall in line with the 
swinging rhythm, or your heart beat a little faster. 
Can you imagine that? 
It would mean that if you heard a singer with 
a John. McCormack voice going through some 
simple song like ‘‘I Hear You Calling Me,”’ or 
“Dear Old Pal of Mine,’’ that you would rather 
talk straight through the song than listen to it. 
It would mean that if you heard a party of boys 
and girls out on a porch on a moonlight night 
singing sentimental ditties, you would not he 
reminded of the days when ‘‘It was from Aunt 
' Dinah’s Quilting Party I Was Seeing Nellie 
Home’’ was the invariable accompaniment to a
-P-A-G-E-118
WHAT ABOUT YOUR BOY? 127 
haywagon ride, and you always introduced your 
uncertain bass or tenor in order to be part of it. 
In fact if you were truly ‘‘unmusical’’ you would 
be a heartless, hopeless excuse of a human, fit for 
even worse things than the ‘‘treasons, strategems 
and spoils’? Shakespeare tells us about. And 
surely you are not that. 
Now the funny part of it is that Dad, in spite of 
his protests, is very apt to be the most genuinely 
musical member of the family. He it is who likes 
soft, slow homey tunes, the old songs he has 
always hummed, and when he thinks no one is 
within ear-shot, lumbers through a well-loved 
melody with the index finger picking it out note 
for note on the piano. 
You see the appeal of music is a direct onslaught 
on the emotions. You don’t have to KNOW about 
a thing technically to FEEL it. It-is right there 
- with its rhythm, its tune and its sentiment, and 
you must be made of stone not to meet it with at 
least some degree of response. You can’t help 
yourself, music is bound to get you, like the gob- 
lins, ‘‘if you don’t watch out,’? and once cap- 
tured, you will be held fast. 
Much of the so-called ‘‘classical stuff?’ seems 
terribly highbrow simply because it is unfamiliar, 
or else because Susan, since her return from 
boarding school, has practiced it by the mile until 
the life is fairly beaten out of it. Let it become 
familiar and be presented as the composer in-

118 «- PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
tended, and immediately ‘‘unmusical’’ Dad will 
find himself a music fan in spite of himself. 
Familiarity with music is all that is needed. 
The greatest boon to the spreading of a liking 
for good music has been the canned article in its 
‘several varieties, although these have not yet 
reached the ‘‘57’’ stage. For instance, there are 
ever so many people just like a friend of mine who 
became the owner of a phonograph. He was abso- 
lutely sure of his ‘‘unmusical’’ state, but never- 
theless something made him expose himself to the 
recording of good music by some of the world’s 
greatest artists. Pretty soon he had his favorites 
among a few records, and one day in a book he 
came across an anecdote about one of the pieces 
he liked. His interest was stimulated, and so he 
found out a bit about the composer. Found out 
that he ‘was-a real human like himself, not. at all 
a queer freak of a highbrow, but a regular man 
who had had his ups and downs in life like all 
the rest of us. , : 
At once that piece of music took an a new mean- 
ing—it became an intimate thing that he could 
know and enjoy thoroughly. And so his knowl- 
edge extended from one piece to another, from 
one artist to another; until finally when a singer 
or a violinist whose records he knew came to town, 
nothing on earth would have kept that man away 
from the concert, although two or three years 
before he would have declared himself bored to
-P-A-G-E-120
WHAT ABOUT YOUR BOY? 119 
death even at the thought of going to such an 
affair. 
Dad is just as potentially musical as all of us, 
and the chances are he will get his enjoyment of 
music much more directly and simply than mother 
and the girls who often let a little bit of technical 
fuss clutter up their emotional reaction. Here is 
where a little knowledge is not dangerous, but 
simply an inconvenience, as it makes one lose the 
reality in a maze of scarcely understood details. 
This superior attitude also makes mother and the 
girls sometimes laugh at father’s choice of the 
good old tunes because he persists in living up to 
his declaration that ‘‘he knows what he likes,’ 
and that is a pretty safe creed to follow. 
And your big boy has this same heritage—the 
love for music, only in his case he is being made 
aware of it, and instead of being half ashamed of 
liking music he welcomes it as one of his greatest 
pleasures,

CHAPTER XI 
MAKE MUSIC A FAMILY AFFAIR 
Our house that long in darkness dwelt, 
And long in silence, day by day, 
Before the mountain snows could melt, 
While yet the world was black and gray, 
Received an impulse from the play 
Of sudden fingers on the strings, 
That made the new-born meadows gay 
With magic touch, as ‘twere the Spring’s. 
—Thomas W. Parsons. 
We are now coming to the point where it seems 
natural to make music a family affair. After 
having dragged father into the game as an active 
agent it should be easy. Mother and the girls very 
naturally fell into line long ago, but the male con- 
tingent of the household had to be treated with 
some circumspection. Even now in some quar- 
ters music is still looked upon with suspicion. It 
has such an insidious way of undermining its 
worst enemies and bringing them over to join the 
tuneful phalanx.. 
The magic of music is surely making itself felt 
in the American household. ‘House-music’’ is 
not nearly so exclusively a foreign term as it 
once used to be. The home is becoming a verit- 
able music center, and promises to be more and 
more so in the future. There is nothing like it for 
120
-P-A-G-E-122
MAKE MUSIC A FAMILY AFFAIR 121 
awakening the get-together spirit. It is a relax- 
ation, it is engrossing, it is fun. 
“More good music in the home’’ should be 
everybody’s slogan. If you make it yours be sure 
and set about it, via your piano, your singing, or 
your phonograph, just for the purpose of having 
a good time. Try out all sorts of things—jolly 
music, music with melody, music to which you can 
attach a story. Make it a game, an entertainment. 
Forget to think of it merely as an object of educa- 
tive uplift. It is useful on that score, but remem- 
ber what Victor Hugo said: ‘‘The beautiful is as 
useful as the useful—perhaps more so.’’ It is 
right to think of music as uplifting, but when that 
side of it is emphasized unduly—and that is the 
crowning mistake of most professional musicians 
—it takes the edge off enjoyment of it. 
‘  $So let us rather resolve that music is placed 
here for our pleasure. Let us look upon it as ideal 
relaxation in the home, and if, as a by-product, 
there is a residue of educative uplift, well and 
good. But ‘‘good’? music is still so frequently 
confounded with ‘‘classical and unpopular’’ that 
the over-anxiety to emphasize its highminded in- 
- fluence is the bugbear that keeps much ‘‘good’’ 
music off the piano rack. The pity of it, too. Jazz 
and ragtime are not the only effective blues 
chasers. 
So in your campaign of ‘‘more good music in 
the home’’ go through your phonograph catalogs.
-P-A-G-E-123
122 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
There are thousands of lovely things to choose 
from that you have never thought about before. 
The same is true of the player rolls, or get easy 
selections from standard operas to play on your 
piano. If mother and daughter both play, why 
not send for some jolly duets? Perhaps brother 
is outdistancing the efforts of the neighborhood 
canines in his efforts on the clarinet. Perhaps 
you can help to hide some of his hopeful vagaries 
of sound by getting him to join in the family con- 
eert. And it will improve his playing too. Get 
father to join in by whistling a tune. Let the 
youngsters keep time and sing too, whether on or 
‘off the key. Make music a family affair. Give 
it a chance. 
The home lure may be strengthened by music 
in various ways. A music game can be made 
out of a memory contest. Various pieces can be 
played on the phonograph, for instance, and every- 
one can try to guess what it is, by whom it is 
composed whether it is a single piece or part of 
an opera, the nationality of the composer, the 
time when it was written, etc. It would be quite 
simple for mother or some other interested mem- 
ber of the family to get up such information about 
the records the family owns, by referring to a 
musical biographical dictionary and a book on 
standard operas. It is surprising how it adds to 
the charms of a piece of music to know some- 
thing about it. In the case of phonograph records
-P-A-G-E-124
MAKE MUSIC A FAMILY AFFAIR 123 
or player rolls there is the added feature of the 
personality of the famous artist whose interpreta- 
tion has been reproduced. 
Another plan that should appeal especially to 
the grown-ups is the neighborhood opera club. 
Had you ever thought of that? You can have such 
a club right in your own town or.even just in your 
own street—if you want to make it very exclusive. 
A club whereby you may have regular good time 
evenings with the most famous operas in the world 
that will be almost as satisfying as the real thing. 
It is very easy. You and a group of your friends 
probably all have phonographs. Have some partic- 
ular opera in mind, like ‘‘Faust’’ or ‘‘Carmen’’ 
or ‘‘Tl Trovatore”’ or ‘‘ Aida,’’ and see how many - 
different records of it are to be found in your 
friends’ collections. Get up a small fund for the 
supplying of a few more, bring them all to one - 
house some evening, have someone read or tell 
the story of the opera and as you come to a point 
that has been ‘recorded, set the machine going or 
the piano player rolling, and hear the music just 
where it fits into the story. 
I know of one small town where this was tried 
with such success that the active members of the 
little club have in turn brought up enough records 
of ‘certain operas to get almost a complete set, 
so that now they have quite a list from which to 
choose an evening’s entertainment. It is not neces- ‘ 
sary to confine the interpretative medium to the
-P-A-G-E-125
SO 
ener 124 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE : 
mechanical reproduction. It would be highly de- 
sirable, by way of variety, to have someone play 
the piano or violin or combination instrumental 
selections, and to have someone sing one or two 
famous solos. All this would add considerably 
to the evening’s enjoyment. 
The point of this suggestion is the value that 
attaches to the idea of music telling a story. None 
of us are ever too old to like a story, and the 
association of any music with a story, or cor- 
related facts, makes it of that much more interest. 
Any single composition may bring in its train an 
association of ideas that are of striking appropri- 
ateness. For instance, the music of Italy, particu- 
larly some of the folk songs, may be linked up 
into the geography lesson. It may lead to a 
description of the people, their customs, their 
traditions. ~ 
The ‘‘Tarantella,’’ made familiar by numerous 
musical settings, will be listened to with renewed 
appreciation if the superstition of the peasants as 
to the whirling dance freeing them from the ill 
effects of the bite of a poisonous spider, is made 
clear. Then the whirling excitement of the ‘‘Tar- 
entella’’ (Italian form of tarantula) as expressed 
by music will make the meaning clear, or if it is 
not an instrumental ‘‘Tarentella’’ you are listen- 
ing to, then perhaps it is a famous vocal interpre- 
tation of it sung by one of the greatest tenors in 
the world, Enrico Caruso, and you feel impelled to
-P-A-G-E-126
MAKE MUSIC A FAMILY AFFAIR 125 
know something more about him too, after you 
have heard him sing. ‘ 
Or here is a piece called ‘‘The Swan’’ played 
by a famous cellist. It is a beautiful melody with 
smoothly flowing accompaniment of rippling 
chords. In your mind’s eye you can see a stately 
garden. There are long green vistas between the 
straight avenues of trees—enticing white walks 
leading to charming nooks—gay flower beds dot- 
ting the green here and there—and over yonder, 
beyond the trees, you catch a glimpse of silvery 
fountains splashing into a mirror-like pool where 
majestic white swans are leisurely swimming. All 
this the music tells you in this lovely piece written 
by Saint-Saens, one of the foremost of French 
composers. You will like it so much that you will 
want to know more about him, too, and of other 
music he has composed and you will probably 
omit no opportunity to follow out this new in- 
terest. Then too, there is the artist who inter- 
preted it so beautifully. Perhaps it was Pablo 
Casals, ‘‘the great little man’’ of the cello who, 
scarcely taller than his huge instrument, wrings 
from it a tone that goes straight to your heart. 
Examples like these might be multiplied a thou- 
sand-fold. The point is that by linking up music 
with its correlated ideas, you get much more from 
it than in any other way. It commences to take 
on an aspect of being something quite different 
from just ‘‘a well-disposed group of notes’? and
-P-A-G-E-127
126 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
becomes something human, something tangible, 
something nice and neighborly and close to us. It 
destroys that ridiculous notion that the art is a 
thing to hold aloof, to consider only from a dis- 
tance and that it defies any intimate relationship. 
This attaching a story is just a further applica- 
tion of the suggestions indicated for the kinder- 
garten years by means of which the meaning of 
music may be brought home to the child. It is 
imperative, however, that there be reason and 
logical association as a basis for your story. By 
' “attaching a story’’ it should be kept clearly in 
mind that the phrase is used somewhat in a meta-— 
phorical. sense. It should be used for one of two 
purposes: either by way of emphasizing musical 
speech—as in the case of representative music in 
which dancing snow-flakes, rain-drops, bubbling 
springs, bird-songs, or any other sounds in nature 
are the direct inspiration; or, it should be used, 
as indicated above, for the correlation of ideas, 
’ such as nationality, customs, traditions, composer, 
artist. 
There is a very fallacious idea rampant, how- 
ever, concerning story-telling possibilities of 
music, and that is the absurd notion of making any 
composition of general character tell a concrete 
set of facts. 
By this means the beautiful nocturnes of 
Chopin, for instance, are frequently used as a 
basis for all sorts of wierd tales. Teachers who
-P-A-G-E-128
MAKE MUSIC A FAMILY AFFAIR 127 , 
find this method an easy way out, and mothers 
and club women who grasp at this lazy straw 
without realizing the harm it does, fall for this 
sort of suggestion readily. 
I remember being the guest of a small music 
elub where this sort of thing was indulged in 
much to the supposed edification of the members. 
The president was about to play one of the 
smaller of the Chopin nocturnes, the one in G 
minor, but before ‘‘rendering’’ it she proposed to 
make her performance more interesting by tell- 
ing the story supposed to be attached to it. 
Whether the tale thereupon unfolded was one 
which she actually thought authentic, or. whether 
she made it up out of whole cloth I do not know. 
But I do know that this perfectly harmless and 
lovely nocturne—the musical interpretation of a 
mood—was made to represent the following scene 
and story. 
Chopin, the composer, was lying on his death 
bed. It was a bright and warm day, and the gentle 
breeze blowing in through the open window 
brought with it the sound of fluttering leaves and 
the song of birds twittering in the branches of 
the nearby trees. All was calm and serene, evi- 
dently, in the poetic soul of the composer, but 
he was slightly sad too, so the lovely melody 
outline of the first part of the nocturne found 
itself onto the sheet of music paper that 
-constantly lay by his side waiting for- just such
-P-A-G-E-129
128 © PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
sudden inspirations. There, if you please, you: 
could hear the twittering of the birds and all the 
pleasant sounds that were wafted through the 
open window. But presently an organ pealed 
forth its weighty message from a neighboring 
church. Straightway this went down on paper 
too, and the result was the middle part of the 
nocturne that sounds like a solemn chorale. After 
this was finished the first theme returned, only to 
die away at the last with a great man’s dying 
- breath. 
Now all this sounded very affecting, so that 
when the piece was finally actually played the 
dear women heard all the things that had been 
suggested to them, and enjoyed themselves ac- 
cordingly. This would all have been very well 
if, in the first place, the piece in question had 
been intended to be representative (program- 
matic) mmsic, and if, in the second place, the 
story had been true. But the actual facts of the 
case were that this is simply one of the poetic] 
mood pieces that Chopin gathered into his famous 
collection of ‘‘nocturnes,’’ and the particular one 
in question was written while he was living down 
" on the Island of Majorea, off the coast of Italy, 
it being the happiest period of his life. So much 
for the death-bed story. 
Now it may be claimed that it should not be 
wrong to attach a definite story, even where none 
was intended, simply because by this method the
-P-A-G-E-130
' 
. ‘MAKE MUSIC A FAMILY AFFAIR 129 
imagination would be appealed to. But the fact 
‘remains that this kind of wrong interpretation is 
~ actually a distortion of the imagination rather 
than the right kind of stimulus. In fact, when 
you come right down to it, itis not even a stimulus, 
but-rather a lazy substitute. 
/’ The beauty of music is that it leaves the imagi- 
nation free to roam with the musie only for a 
: guide. The same piece may mean one thing to you 
~ and another to me, and in any case it simply 
establishes a mood to which you and I respond. 
Here, for example, is a-lovely quiet twilight piece. 
Its mood is that of the close of day., It bespeaks 
a lingering sunset, a serenity of spirit, a time for 
retrospection. We hear it, you and I, and quietly 
we sit-and drink it in. It.inspires in both of us 
the same quietude of mood, but this mood brings 
to each a different line of thought and association. 
To you perhaps it brings up a picture of pleasant 
walks along garden paths with some well loved 
friend—perhaps something lovely that has gone 
out of your life and left just a quiet sadness be- 
hind. To me it may bring dreams or half de- | 
fined hopes of pleasant twilight hours to come. 
In either case we hear the music, and we love it 
for the message it brings. And our dreams or 
reminiscences would be rudely jarred by the in- 
treduction of a definite story to which we should 
have to glue our impressions. In other words it 
is the magic of music again manifesting its mys-
-P-A-G-E-131
130 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
terious power by which it reaches out and. makes 
friends of each of us and brings to each of us 
just what we need the most. This is too beautiful 
a thing to lose by pasting our own artificial mis- 
interpretation all over it. It is better to let its 
hidden meaning remain hidden. By that means 
its emotional quality will find its true response. 
Another very necessary matter to be taken into 
account in the ‘‘music in the home’’ campaign is 
the question of good manners. The art of listen- 
ing to music should be cultivated as assidiously 
from the earliest years as the art of politeness 
in conversation. You do not, if you are a cour- 
teous person, interrupt someone who is talking, or 
fail to heed what is being said, openly paying no 
attention. And it is just as important to culti- 
vate the same degree of courtesy in the matter of 
listening to music. 
There is much unthinking rudeness going on all 
around us when music is performed. In a small 
company someone is asked to play the piano. 
Scarcely are the first notes struck when a low 
buzz of conversation starts up in different parts 
of the room. The speakers seem to think the 
music will cover up their whisperings, and in any 
event they give only a poor semblance of listening 
although it is possible that the most glib conversa- 
tionalists will be the ones who will the most glibly 
tell the pianist ‘‘That was perfectly lovely” when 
it is all over.
-P-A-G-E-132
MAKE MUSIC A FAMILY AFFAIR 131 
When mother plays for the children they should 
be taught to listen whether they seem interested 
or not. At least they should learn to be quiet dur- 
ing the music. It is just as important to enforce 
this rule later on when someone is performing 
presumably for their enjoyment, and this listening 
attitude should even be carried to the time when 
phonograph records or player rolls, other than 
dance music, are played. The mere fact that the 
helpless machine cannot talk back does not make 
it the less an obligation to listen, for if you do 
not listen what is the use of having it going? 
By not paying attention when a machine is 
making music, as is frequently the case, the habit 
-of not listening is unconsciously carried over to 
those times when a human being is making the 
music, and at least it becomes just that much 
harder to concentrate on what is being performed. 
But the harm lies not only in politeness. It is a 
dulling of the emotional effect. If you habitually 
hear music and pay no attention to it your. music 
sense will soon become so dulled that you will be 
conscious of it hardly at all. It becomes a mean- 
ingless drumming to you, mentally affecting you 
only as so much noise. The result to your music 
sense will be quite like that of the alarm clock 
that you set for a certain hour each morning. At 
first it will wake you up, and if you obey its warn- 
ing you will get up. But if you lazily turn over 
and go to sleep again, after a few trials, the voice
-P-A-G-E-133
132 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE - 
of the alarm clock will sing into deaf. ears, and 
you will not hear it at all. , 
In many families—one might almost say in 
most families—where there is a phonograph, this 
habit of setting the machine going and then pay- 
ing absolutely no attention to it excepting to take 
off one record and put on another, is the rule 
rather than the exception. And these same per- 
sons, when they go to a ‘concert are very likely 
to belong to that vexing coterie who think music 
is to be treated as an accompaniment to conversa- 
tion. Without consideration for others, and with- 
out consideration for themselves, they busy them- 
selves in various annoying ways while the music 
is going on, apparently quite impervious to its- 
- message. 
\ Learning to be a listener has its twofold reward. 
It makes for a development of the music sense, 
and it makes for a respectful attitude toward the 
art and its votaries.
-P-A-G-E-134
CHAPTER XII 
MORAL INFLUENCE 
To neglect the daily growth in one’s capacity 
for the beautiful is absolutely harmful to the indi- 
vidual especially in the matter of his moral and 
apiritual nature. 
—Darwin. 
. (To determine the moral influence of music its 
‘status as a psychological factor in education must 
be fully understood. It is so usual to consider 
only the esthetic and cultural effects of art edu- 
cation that the wider aspects in which it acquires 
the power of psychological force are entirely lost 
sight of or overlooked. And yet there is abundant 
proof that music instruction, rightly eonducted, 
does influence the child as well as the mature man 
or woman in unexpected ways. 
' With the first class singing in the school-room 
the backward child gains poise and assurance, 
and breaks away from the burden of a too great 
self-consciousness. Whether he can sing or not, 
he is urged to: take part, to get into the game. 
He becomes one with his fellow-playmates, he 
gains confidence in himself, and he is a creator! 
He is doing the music. He becomes the song. He 
finds it inspiring. He is carried outside of him- 
self. He is a part of it all. 
133
-P-A-G-E-135
134 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
This makes him a better student in other classes, 
more alert, more interested. The school is a nice 
place. Something to be proud of. Teacher is 
wonderful. And so by such easy, tuneful means 
the very foundations of a happy school life are 
based on the first song. With such an incentive 
it is easy to feel a loyalty toward the school. By 
such means new friends are won, the surroundings 
take on an added attractiveness, and the young 
child—later the growing boy or girl—learns to 
wield a certain influence over both friends and 
strangers as the pleasant self-assertiveness we 
recognize as poise makes itself felt. And poise 
is power, Music establishes itself at once then as 
one of the chief character building influences of 
the school curriculum. 
This is in direct line with the newer theory of 
education that it is not so much a matter of mental 
discipline as of character discipline. It is now 
considered not nearly so important what a man 
knows as how he uses what he knows. The study 
scheme is worked out to fit in with the idea that to 
be of real value, or rather, of the best value, the 
whole of man’s nature must be taken into account 
—the mental, moral, emotional and physical. And 
there is no subject in the educational scheme that 
as wholly and directly affects every one of these 
elements in man’s make-up. 
‘ It is conceded that music is one of the best mind- 
trainers.
-P-A-G-E-136
MORAL INFLUENCE. 135 
* Its emotional appeal is obvious. 
. Its beneficial effect on the physical well-being 
of the child has been indicated. Its broader ap- 
plication as a means to health will be treated of 
later. 
The. question before ‘us now is of its moral in- 
fluence—its value as a character builder, for we 
always assume that character building means de- 
velopment in the right direction. 
Can music aid in making the child a better 
citizen? Will it function as an asset in helping 
him to cope with the social problems that life will 
bring him? And the answer to these questions is 
unequivocally, Yes! 
If we accept as correct the theory that educa- 
tion should be a rounding out of the whole of 
man’s nature, then the purely intellectual educa- 
tion that finds no room for the development of the 
esthetic sense, makes no allowances for emotional 
' reactions and their effect on character, becomes a 
one-sided proposition. Like all one-sided proposi- 
tions it has its stultifying effect, and we see the 
products of it on all sides. Such men scoff at all 
that is beautiful as being something quite outside 
the business of life—something that cannot touch 
any man of affairs. It is.all very well for women 
and ‘children and long-haired sexless beings to 
dabble in if they like, but for men who are doing 
the world’s work—never! 
Themostocles, a great statesmen and soldier of
-P-A-G-E-137
- 136 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
ancient Greece, when asked at a feast to play the 
lute, said with disdain ‘‘that he could not play 
music and yet he could make a small town a great | 
city!’? And we can hear hearty applause atising 
from our fellow-workers who take the same stand. 
But they and the mighty Themostocles make the 
same mistake—that-of looking upon the perforth- 
ance of music as an accomplishment. The ‘‘doing’’ 
is of quite negligible importance. In facet; in 
most instances, it is highly desirable that you do 
not do if you have any consideration for your 
friends. The value lies not in the doing but in the 
liking of music. ‘‘I should rather have my boy 
like it than do it’’ one wise mother said who was 
conducting her boy’s musical education along the 
lines that would later in life bring him the greatest 
profit. Call it appreciation, or what you will, by 
incorporating the study of music in the educative 
scheme it awakens a sense of a whole new world 
to which the man’s interest without this prodding 
remains forever deaf and blind. Again it must 
be urged that its value in giving him 4 new slant 
on life lies altogether in the liking of it. And 
that liking can only be established through 
familiarity. ‘ 
The properly balanced education of the future 
(and even of the present) will take into account 
the effect of the properly aroused estheti¢ sense. 
This brings in its train broader sympathies, a 
truer brotherliness, a more wholesomie citizénship.
-P-A-G-E-138
  MORAL INFLUENCE 137 
By this means emotions are refined without being 
softened (your unesthetic scoffer to the contrary). 
It makes for a saner and more progressive out-. 
look. “Mental and moral influences will then more 
easily work hand in hand to the very distinct 
betterment of the human race. 
Typical products of the purely intellectual edu- 
cation that believes its value lies in the quantity of 
knowledge pumped into the human cranium, and 
that bothering with the esthetic or the cultural is 
a waste of time, are to be seen all about us—in 
our colleges, in the office, even in the professions. 
A case in point is an occurrence at one of our 
large universities. A fine orchestra was giving a 
program of musical masterpieces. These college 
boys, trained to scoff at anything ‘‘highbrow’’ in 
. the arts, although they were bright and alert stu- 
dents along other lines, did not know how to listen 
to music and worse yet, thought they didn’t want 
to, Someone shouted a demand for ragtime. The 
clamor grew, until the demand became so insistent 
that the concert.came to an abrupt end. Here was 
a fine lot of young college boys, diseourteous in 
the extreme, who showed not only a total lack of 
consideration for others, but eloquently proved the 
void in their own educative preparation. , 
These men will go-out into the world and many 
of them will gain a very respectable material suc- 
cess, but they will not be the men whose names 
will be linked with the greatest institutions, the
-P-A-G-E-139
  
  138 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE } 
most progressive movements and the. finest 
achievements. 
Shakespeare knew what he was talking about 
when he said so many years ago ‘‘The man who 
hath no music in ‘his breast is fit for treasons, 
strategems and spoils.’? The man today who has 
shut himself off from all the refining influences of 
musie and the other arts, may be a brainy alert 
man, and a certain degree of material success may 
be his. But he is a man of action only, measuring 
every move by a yard-stick with a view to what he 
will get out of it. He can see only as far as his 
immediate needs and interests carry him. His is 
a shortsighted vision. He is no builder of dreams. 
Unlike him is the man who can see through the 
wall of the next minute, who has vision, sympathy 
and insight, whose dreams come true, and it is 
on these dreams that the progress of the world 
is builded. 
We all know what an important part. music 
played in the late war. If it was used suecess- 
fully by the enemy for the putting across of a 
wrong ethics, that was because its value as a psy- 
chological force had been tried and tested. It 
was used as a weapon just as surely as gas and 
gun-powder. 
_ With us its psychological force was still un- 
recognized, and,it was not until the war was half 
over that music began to be used on a large scale 
“to help organize vietory.’? From then on it was
-P-A-G-E-140
MORAL INFLUENCE 139 
used in every conceivable form as a comfort, as 
‘a relaxation from the horrors of war, and as a 
stimulus to the morale of our men. During that 
time the Congress made a half-hearted attempt to 
place music in the class of luxuries which would 
have sadly interfered with its prolific dissemina- 
tion. But happily the movement was side-tracked, 
and sweet harmony played its great part in the 
war. Jazz on the battle-line and other vigorous, 
martial music, with singing a lusty part of it all, 
helped mightily when marching to an unknown 
fate, and it brought the equally great benefit of 
its solace to those behind the lines. 
How the men craved music is proved by the 
care and invention that went into the making of it. 
A vietrola was carried lovingly almost into the 
firing line; it dispensed its sometimes doubtful’ 
harmonies (fancy keeping a victrola or any other 
music machine in apple-pie order at the front), 
first to one group and then to another, and then 
it was trundled back to a nearby hospital where 
it acquired all the sacredness of a ministering 
angel., : 
Imagine if you will, the surprise and even con- 
sternation of a perfectly innocent tin cracker box 
lying quiescent with the comfortable knowledge 
of duty well performed, finding itself suddenly 
manipulated by eager hands into a twangy-pangy 
guitar. Its metamorphosis completed, it hence- 
forth allowed itself to be tweaked and plucked
-P-A-G-E-141
140 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
and strummed and ‘‘vibrated’’ to the limit of its 
own and its proud creator’s endurance. 
Similarly bewildered was the wholly innocuous 
(when empty) cigar box that suddenly found itself 
transformed into a fancy mandolin, minus the 
conventional number of strings. Its solitary trip 
of suspension (made of heaven knows what) did 
noble duty by way of camouflaging the single- 
track pang-pang box into a veritable Pandora 
treasure chest of soothing rhythms. In the hos- 
pitals the patients fell to making comb musie, if’ 
there was nothing else to be had. So it would 
seem after all that our boys wanted and needed 
and ‘‘appreciated’’ music. 
The threatened classification of music as a non- 
essential, finally happily side-tracked, at least had 
the salutary effect of bringing the music industry 
interests together in the fight. And it was un- 
doubtedly due to the well organized plan of op- 
_ position to the measure, led by George W. Pound, 
general manager of the Music Industries Chamber 
of Commerce, that the government discontinued 
the non-essential attitude. Not only was music 
mobilized as an auxiliary to the war, but more 
and more we found that it was needed at home, 
too. That, however, was quite another side of 
the picture. ‘ 
‘ In the meanwhile music as a cure for physical 
: ills reached the dignity of a clearly defined func- 
tion during the war, and its most ardent devotees

MORAL INFLUENCE , 44d 
now hold that it may soon solve your domestic 
problems likewise. As a universal panacea, its 
power would seem, therefore, to be. unrivaled. 
Music in hospitals performed (and is perform- 
ing) many modern miracles. As a therapeutic 
agency it is functioning wonderfully well. And 
while the direct applications of its effects is still 
a matter of study, enough has already been’ estab- 
Jished to make it of real help in the beneficial 
treatment or cure of certain mental and physical 
conditions. 
Hospital music for purposes other than that of 
entertainment is neither as senseless nor as new 
a proceeding as is commonly supposed. It has 
been tried spasmodically in many places over a 
period of many years. In fact the ‘‘corridor sing- 
ing’’ today in St. Thomas’s Hospital, in London, 
is a custom that had its inception from Florence 
Nightingale’s request for ward music in hospitals 
during the now almost forgotten Crimean War. 
But it is this last war that brought its greatest 
opportunity. : 
We know that Dad’s son is as responsive to 
music as his father, and he admits it after he 
gets over the age when he thinks it unmanly to 
acknowledge an interest in something that is ‘‘just 
for girls.’ During the war our sons certainly 
demonstrated that music meant much more to 
them than anyone had ever supposed. 
We know so much of what was done with it in
-P-A-G-E-143
142 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
sending our boys over the top, and we heard so 
much of it passing our very door, that that phase 
of music’s share in organizing for victory is a 
familiar story. Less spectacular, perhaps, but of 
the greatest. possible importance was the part 
music played behind the scenes in the hospitals, 
both by. way of entertainment and. as a genuine 
therapeutic agency. It supplied to many a 
wounded hero the incentive to go ‘‘over the top’’ 
back into good health, or at least back into the 
best possible place life held out to those who were 
severely handicapped. 
Especially trained experts were appointed by 
the government to direct the use of musie in hos- 
pitals, to apply this wonderful remedy where and 
how it would do the most good, and with the full 
approval of the medical profession. Music was 
organized not only for recreational purposes, but 
_for purposes of health and so well were these 
A logically conceived ideas carried out that many a 
wounded boy, or shell shock victim, now owes his 
return to reason and to health through this béne- 
ficent influence. 
The music-cure was no hit or miss project, but 
a carefully worked out plan whereby certain kinds 
of music and certain tone qualities were used as 
definitely as drugs to bring about a mental or 
physical rehabilitation. Those who have been 
most actively engaged in making musie in hos- 
pitals count for something divide it into three
-P-A-G-E-144
_ MORAL INFLUENCE. 143 
classes—entertainment, occupational, reconstruct- 
ive. The first characterization is obvious in that 
it merely represents wholesome diversion with the 
mind of the patient remaining entirely passive. 
The second means the playing on musical instru- 
ments by the patients themselves, their minds 
and their energies occupied and stimulated. The 
third, of the greatest importance, is the use of 
certain music and certain instruments as an aid 
to recovery. The music doses were as carefully 
_ prepared as any other kind. of medicine. 
As far as the proper use of mechanical devices 
is concerned, the kind of movement and effort 
' needed to create a musical tone must be carefully 
studied. In the war hospitals many a useless 
hand became normal again through the plucking 
of a mandolin, or flexibility came to aimless fingers 
through strumming on a guitar. Both are in- 
struments easy to learn. The helpless trembling 
“of the lip that interfered with the speech of shell 
shock patients, rendering them self-conscious and 
recovery slow, was controlled and frequently 
cured quickly by properly guided playing on a 
small wind instrument like the flute or oboe, or 
even a jewsharp. 
The point of greatest value in this work seems 
to be that music under proper guidance became a 
valuable occupation whereby interest that had 
seemed dead was aroused in other things in gen- 
eral, and a mind blurred by contact with un-
-P-A-G-E-145
144 PUTTING YOUNG, AMERICA IN TUNE 
speakable horrors was quieted and made normal 
again. 
Music was found to be helpful in many a diffi- 
cult diagnosis. It was used to accompany anes- 
thesia. And it was found that not only different 
compositions or styles of music, but different tone 
qualities and rhythms established their. own reac- 
tions. ‘‘What is one man’s fish is another man’s 
poison’’ is evidently as true when using musical 
sounds for therapeutic purposes as when using. 
any other kind of medical treatment. 
It was found that the harp was the most sooth- 
ing of all instruments, and music without words 
was more quieting and helpful than when accom- 
' panied by words when the effort to follow their 
meaning would have seemed to the patient a. 
mountainous task. Music in the hospitals during 
the war, and even now, has brought cheer to 
many a dear homesick lad, has brought hope to 
a suffering one where black despair had descended 
like a nightmare, and has brought courage to face 
life under new and hard conditions. 
But it is not only in general hospitals that music . 
is of value when used with a knowledge of its 
psychological and physical effects. ‘‘The punish- 
ment fits the crime” quite ag well in asylums for 
the insane, the deaf and dumb, the blind, in the 
care of defective children, and even in correcting 
the criminal tendencies of inmates of peniten- 
tiaries. In the problems of this clattering, every-
-P-A-G-E-146
MORAL INFLUENCE 145 
day life of ours music helps too. And while music 
may be used as a curative factor with criminals 
it should be of interest to note that only one half 
of one per cent of the inmates of our jails are 
drawn from the ranks of artists. They may be 
weak, many of them, or queer or eccentric, but 
they are seldom vicious members of society. 
_ In her capacity as chief restorer of the mental 
and physical equilibrium of the so-called human 
race, the ‘‘Heavenly Maid’’ is outdistancing all 
het rivals as the benefactor of mankind. If Johnny 
refuses to run on an errand for mother, play a 
Sousa march or something else zippy for him on 
the piano or phonograph. At once it will ‘‘ener- 
- gize’’ him and send him flying along the street 
with impetuous eagerness to be of service. . If 
Jane of the kitchen lolls over her work, pack the 
lullabies and soothing syrup serenades carefully 
on the top shelf, and jazz her up (oh yes, that 
is perfectly proper), with the lastest syncopated 
creations. 
Letting your domestic pot boil to an Irish jig 
may sound more tuneful than sensible, but the 
energizing or soothing power of music is a matter- 
worth taking seriously. It will solve many prob- 
lems for you.

CHAPTER XII 
CULTIVATING GOOD TASTE 
Familiar music is liked. 
—Theodore Thomas. 
/ In any large first-class motion picture house 
you get your most typical American audience. It 
is democratic, it is there because it wants to be, 
and it knows what it likes—and incidentally has 
no fear of expressing itself. When, therefore, in 
the interval between ‘‘pictures’’ the orchestra 
breaks into the favorite popular song of the mo- 
ment, or the latest jazz hit, it is met with a spon- 
taneous and vigorous burst of applause. Why? 
Because the people know it and like it. 
It is all very well for your ‘‘real musician”’ to 
sniff at this evidence of bad taste, and to raise a 
supercilious brow at such ‘‘ordinary stuff,’’ but 
the indisputable fact remains that the people like 
it. And at home the same thing is going on, for 
you find gathered around your piano a group of 
high school boys and girls, lustily singing all the 
songs of the day, and having an exceedingly good 
time doing it too. If you disapprove,.on the basis 
of bad taste, what are you going to do about 
it? What will you offer as a substitute? And 
what do you think of when you say ‘‘popular 
music?’?’ 
146
-P-A-G-E-148
CULTIVATING GOOD TASTE 147 
In the first place is popular music bad? If-so, 
how bad? Why, ragtime, of course! In condemn- 
ing it are you quite sure you are not confusing the 
musie itself with the surroundings in which it 
‘ flourishes best? It must be remembered that music, 
in itself, is neither moral nor unmoral; it is only 
by association that it becomes so. And very fre- 
quently the worst company . ragtime song we 
keeps is the words. 
f When songs are trashy it i ords that make 
\ them so, and in this regard parents are surpris- 
ingly thoughtless. It would not occur to you, for 
instance, to permit a salacious story to find its 
way into your house, or if it did, you would soon 
get rid of it. And to place obscene or suggestive 
pictures on the walls of your home would be ab- 
solutely unthinkable. But it doesn’t occur to you. 
to watch the piano rack, although on it repose 
- often enough songs that you should be ashamed 
to have in the house and that your youngsters and 
, their young friends would be ashamed to sing if 
/they gave the matter real thought. The saving 
grace of the popular song singing lies in the fact 
, that it is done thoughtlessly for the most part, or 
else pure-minded young girls could not bring 
themselves to shout sentiments at the piano that 
in conversation they would not dream of express- 
ing. It is undoubtely true that much of this kind 
‘of singing is done without a full realization of 
any feature of it excepting the contagious pulse
-P-A-G-E-149
148 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
‘of its rhythm. Therefore it is the music, and 
nothing else, that is the attraction. 
Nevertheless the truly trashy song, even if 
done with a thoughtless swing, is harmful, and 
_ your collection of popular music should at once 
be subjected to careful inspection. Strangely 
enough, just after we entered the war there was 
a new crop of popular songs of a particularly 
nasty characte lime words were 80 suggestive 
that even the ers of first-class vaudeville 
houses banded together and forbad the rendition 
of them. And yet those same songs in several 
- eases were sold by the million and carried their 
polluted sentiments into as many homes. 
But such songs as those, represent only one 
phase—and happily quite a small one—of popular 
musie¢, and it is utterly absurd to class all popular 
music as trashy or even undesirable, for that is by 
no means true. Wholesale condemnation will not 
‘right matters. 
An amusing instance of an esthetic censor run- 
ning amuck occurred in a western city recently 
when a sanctimonious civic censorship league had 
the billboards decorated with huge posters bear- 
ing the legend ‘‘Hold your nose!’’ It was an 
anti-jazz campaign. To the curious one who ap- 
proached to read the finer print it was discover- 
able that all good citizens were urged to show 
their disgust at this ‘‘degrading, nauseating, de- 
moralizing’’ variant of the rag by shutting their

olfactory nerve center with a gesture that bespoke 
utter contempt. / 
- Oolor music had been with us for some time, 
and now it seemed that the latest was to be (to 
put it delicately), perfume music. Innumerable 
theories have been put forward as to the manner 
in which music reacts on the other senses. Color 
music is an old story which has been esthetically 
described and scientifically proved. So the quite 
up-to-date person, with the properly controlled 
esthetic sense, will see green when he hears Bach, 
and mauve when he listens to Debussy, and heaven 
. knows what when he hears Wagner—probably red 
until his war sentiments are all calmed down. 
According to certain theorists the visual idea 
is to be carried still further so that definite ob- 
jects are said to be brought to mind through the 
medium of sets of vibrations. In other words, fol- 
lowing this theory, you are to see things, not only _ 
lors, when you hear music. Which is a reminder 
of the lady in ‘‘Howard’s End,’’ who could think 
of nothing but pink elephants when she heard 
Beethoven’s fifth symphony! And the young man 
for whom Elgar’s Caractacus meant bananas! 
The mistake these earnest workers for the pub- 
lic welfare were making in their anti-jazz cam- 
paign was to confound the music with its environ- 
ment, ‘That the conditions in which the jazz band 
has found itself the most at home are in need of 
reform, there can be no gainsaying. But to put
-P-A-G-E-151

all the blame on this syncopation raised to the 
n’th power is too much. 
If persisting means anything, if universality is 
a true indicator, then ragtime, including jazz, is 
the one enduring type of music indigenous to 
American soil. Although ragtime has not yet re- 
ceived ‘‘the clammy hand of fellowship from com- 
posers and critics’’ that would appear to be no 
cause for dismay. Independent of highbrow 
- opinion, indifferent to all the wrangling of which 
it is the innocent instigator, this persuasive, in- 
sinuating arrangement of syncopated rhythm has 
spread its restless self from Podunk to Petrograd 
—and been hailed with equal delight in both 
places. Let us consider ragtime and all its 
relatives seriously for a moment. 
An illuminating theory put forward by Ivan 
: Narodny is to the effect that ragtime is entirely 
_a city product, and for that reason differs so 
radically from the simple folk song. Mr. Narodny 
says: ‘‘Ragtime is the very opposite of a folk 
melody. What the one denies, that the other uses 
as its very foundation. Folksong is the product 
of the village and the country; ragtime’s birth- 
place is the city. The one is of rural, the other 
of urban nature. <A folksong mirrors the joys 
and sorrows, hopes and passions. of the country 
‘people. It has been moulded under the blue sky 
in sunshine and storm. The songs of birds and the 
voices of nature form its phonetic background.’’
-P-A-G-E-152
  CULTIVATING GOOD TASTE , 151 
“The place of the birth and growth of ragtime 
song is in the city exclusively. It exalts the noise, 
dust, rush and vulgarity of the street. Its rhythm 
suggests the odor of the saloons, the smell of the 
backyards and subways. Its style is decadent, 
and its melody is the voice of a nervous society 
figure.’’ 
So that is it. Ragtime is born of the city. And~ 
the city being the same the world over, reacts 
enthusiastically to this phonetic expression of cul- 
ture that so marvelously expresses the restless, 
harried complexities of urban existence. 
It has been noted with wonder by the neutral 
observer and with derisive dismay by the arti- 
ficially cultured musician (but all musicians are 
not like that) that ragtime has a universal appeal. 
This purely American product has found its ad- 
herents in all the great cities of the world. You 
are just as likely to eat your soup to the tune of 
‘‘Everybody’s Doing It”? in Paris or Moskow or 
Tokio as in New York. It seems to be the one 
element: that unites mankind, and is therefore a 
musical phenomenon that is to be reckoned with. 
¢ Jazz was right on the battle line during the war, . 
| too, and in spite of being ‘‘degrading music’’ 
“made a noble record. The first American negro 
soldiers to get into active fighting formed a band 
that became famous, and the way they put jazz

their fellow fighters, and set France by the ears

afterward, is one of the most startling stories of 
the war. <A fighting band that could buoyantly 
fling its tunes right into the face of an enemy 
machine gun that was lustily exercising its lungs, 
and.could successfully compete with the ff-us-uf-ff 
music of 12-inch shells hurtling through the air, 
was certainly doing its duty. 
The exciting influence of ragtime and jazz on a 
throng of people who by force of circumstances 
- have to sit still and listen, is so nearly suffocat- 
ingly cumulative that it hits you between the eyes 
when you come into the midst of it. And yet there 
are those who confound jazz with its, at times, 
unsavory surroundings, and call it degrading, for- 
getting quite that the wierd elemental wildness of 
its insouciante rhythms is a racial expression that 
holds everyone in thrall. Khythomaniaes the 
negroes have been called. Certainly they have an 
uncanny ability to place the accent where, by all the 
laws of white man’s music, it should not be placed, 
but that, if you please, is jazz. There is nothing 
more contagious than this peculiarly American 
music our dark brothers have given us, and which 
so eloquently expresses our national motto, ‘‘Step 
lively, please,’? by which in these so-called peace- 
ful United States we live and move.and have our 
being. 
The true significance of ragtime is yet to be 
definitely established. But it is so original and 
so vigorous that it prevails with a persistence
-P-A-G-E-154
‘ CULTIVATING GOOD TASTE 153 
that no amount or degree of evolution can render 
nugatory. Like it or not, ragtime has come to 
, Stay as a rightful heritage of certain phases of 
“the American spirit. It may be. noisy, violent, 
. vulgar, but it also is natural and vigorous and — 
\ shockingly strong. It may be ‘‘earth’s saddest _ 
tausic”’ to the one who sees in it only the reflec- 
tion of the city’s ugliness. But it is the basis for 
a newer musical art to him who sees in it a reflec- 
tion of the condensed citified form of human 
_achievement. 
“So much in defense of ragtime. Thete will be 
those who will feel it should not be defended at 
all but that is because they lose sight of its basic 
tausical significance—one might say, its psycho- 
‘logical significance. 
Just what does and does not constitute popular 
music is a broad question with many ramifications. 
It will suffice for the purposes of this discussion 
to point out that ‘‘popular’’ music need no more 
be confined to jazz and its variants than that 
“elassical’? need be marked as synohymous with 
highbrow and dry. ‘‘Classieal’’ and ‘‘popular’’ 
_are more often than not interchangeable terms, 
and as the love of music grows some rather ridi- 
ealous barriers that have been set up by purists 
are being carefully kicked into the limbo of false 
standards. 
Wrong notions about good and bad music, the 
real arid the pseudo, are being systematically com-
-P-A-G-E-155
154 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
bated with the most astounding results. When- 
ever good music is brought before the people not 
as a sugar-coated high- brow dose of something 
‘‘elevating,’’? but simply as entertainment, they 
respond eagerly, gladly, and cry for more. And 
straightway it begins to be popular. So after all 
what is, and what is not popular is a matter of 
taste. : 
‘‘Pamiliar music is liked.”? That-is, as soon as 
we know music well we begin to like it. The point 
now is how to turn our children’s taste in the 
right direction, And is not the answer perfectly 
obvious? Let the best become popular through 
the process of familiarity. And that can be ac- 
complished the most easily in the home. It is in 
the home that good or bad taste is formed, and 
taste is largely a matter of environment. Wise 
parents want to have their children sutrounded by 
the best in art and books. Then why not with 
the best in music too? And yet there are many 
_homes still without music, or with only the trashy 
kind represented. In such surroundings the music 
sense in the child is apt to starve to death, or 
at least be sadly perverted. The lack of good 
_tIausic does not seem to be realized, though it is 
quite the same as starving a child’s color sense 
by surrounding him with blank, white walls and 
ugly furnishings. , 
There is no excuse nowadays for the musicless 
home, for the mechanical instruments will make

a world renowned virtuoso of every member of 
every family who avails himself of the privilege. 
The entire world of music and the most famous 
interpreters are at your beck and call by the mere 
push of a button. Equally so there is no excnse 
for the preponderance of trashy music—trashy 
at least as to sentiment. Too much ragtime play- 
ing is all wrong because it is a one-sided activity - 
that perverts the taste and interferes with the 
-full development of the music sense by which all 
music worthy of the name ean be appreciated. 
If there was a defence of ragtime it was on 
behalf of its individual characteristics. It is in 
a class by itself. But playing it is a contagious 
disease that must be combated by other music, © 
and commonsense, or else it will become the domi-: 
nating musical influence in the home. It is not 
[ wrong for your youngsters to like ragtime or any 
\“popular’’ music, but it must be kept in its place. 
It ig not wrong for your child to like candy, but 
to give him candy all the time is not good for him. 
So it is with popular music. Wise parents will 
permit it on the piano, that it may be played in 
addition to music tasks determined by the music 
teacher. But popular music will not be permitted 
to usurp the situation in the well-regulated musi- 
cal household, nor to drive other music out. The 
music diet is an easy one to control if parents 
will give it the requisite attention. . 
Children’s fundamental taste in music being

easiest thing in the world to win their true ap- 
preciation for what is most worth while. They, 
even more than grown-ups, love the familiar which

In the matter of selecting the music they are to

boring them with music they are not ready to 
enjoy the plan defeats its own purpose. Let them 
hear simple, direct melodies from the music of 
the greatest composers—the old classic masters.

of a more complex nature and make it possible 
for them (when you cafi do so) to hear great | 
artists, an orchestta, ete. Whether at a concert 
or at home set the example of listening when music 
is performed. Good manners, like good taste, 
might just as well become a habit.

ters of adding to, the interest of the music heard 
by using associated material—something of the 
story, the composer, and, in the case of mechanical 
’ reproductions, the artist whose interpretation has 
just delighted you. Make the music interest an

affair, Let the child, as soon as possible, become 
an active agent in helping to establish the musical 
atmosphere. Get his codperation and you will be

childhood in a home where music either does not 
exist, or is an entirely negligible quantity. If 
you want your child to grow into a music lover 
you must give his natural born music sense some- 
thing to feed upon. Make that something as at- 
tractive and as worth while as possible, always 
bearing in mind that lack of technical knowledge 
need offer no handicap in this fine work. Every-

‘CHAPTER XIV 
WHAT EVERY HOME SHOULD HAVE 
Music is the C Major of this life. 
—Robert Browning. / 
‘What every home should have is somewhat of 
a direct continuance of the points brought up in 
the preceding chapter, and yet there is a certain 
angle that needs a more detailed explanation. 
And that is our attitude toward music appre- 
ciation. . . 
Parents seemed filled with the idea that hav. 
ing no technical knowledge ties their hands abso- 
lutely in the attempt to help their children to an 
appreciation of music. But it cannot be empha- 
sized too strongly that this is a mistaken idea, 
and not true at all. It is an opinion right in line 
with the other one so often heard: ‘‘I can’t ap- 
preciate good musie, I suppose it’s because I don’t 
understand it.’? Let us puncture ‘‘appreciate’’ 
and ‘‘understand”’ as they are used here. 
In the first place, in the phrase, ‘‘I can’t appre- 
ciate,’? the word is actually used as being dis- 
tinetly and exclusively synonymous with ‘‘like.’? 
“T can’t appreciate’’ really means to the person 
saying it, ‘I don’t like.” Now what was in truth 
the case is that the man or woman glibly announc- 
158 '
-P-A-G-E-160
WHAT EVERY HOME SHOULD HAVE 159 
ing this familiar verdict was bored and uninter- 
ested. The music seemed unattractive and mean- 
ingless, all of which led to a sigh of relief when it 
was over with. Why? Because there had been no 
development of taste for music. And yet there 
might have been appreciation without liking. The 
two need not mean the same thing. A realization 
that a painting or musical composition is a great 
art work may still bring with it no enjoyment. 
You can appreciate a thing and yet not like it. 
The additional statement, ‘‘I don’t understand 
it’’ is in reality a statement of the unexpressed 
feeling that, somehow, music must be hard to 
understand and that you, a musical layman, could 
scarcely be expected to understand something of 
which you have no technical knowledge. Here 
you are all wrong. , 
The fact of the matter is there is nothing ex- 
elusive about music or any of the arts. It is the 
most thoroughly democratic expression of human 
emotion you can imagine. It belongs equally to 
you and to me, to the veriest layman and to the 
musician who has made music the study of a life- 
time. A little child may appreciate it to the same 
extent as the greatest virtuoso. The appreciation 
varies only in kind, not in degree. The child 
responds because the music makes him happy, or 
a bit sad, he knows not why. It has a strange 
power. Whatever it is, it makes the child feel 
something. And the musical layman, quite like
-P-A-G-E-161
- 160 oo PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
the child, may if he will, get the message of music 
. in the same direct fashion, only that is more diffi- 
cult for the grown-up to do unless he has trained 
himéelf in such appreciation. 
The great virtuoso, someone who makes music 
himself either as a creative or an interpretative 
artist, takes a far more complicated state of mind 
to the hearing of music. He brings with him a 
trained ear, a highly specialized music sense, a 
_ ritical attitude that discovers and weighs both 
the best and the worst points, and an intelligent 
understanding of the intention of the composer, 
the technical details involved, and the command 
of resourceful invention. In a sense he, of course, 
gets more out of the performance than the musi- 
eal layman but his reaction is correspondingly 
complex, and from the standpoint of pure enjoy- 
ment it is a grave question if he gets as much as 
his untrained neighbor. 
The chief aim of an art is to dispense beauty, 
‘and therefore happiness. While training in the 
art is desirable for many reasons, it is absolutely 
true that the untrained listener, if he has been 
' taught to like music, will get equally as much out 
of it and possibly more. Of course the develop- 
ment of the music sense through association with 
music, through hearing a great deal of it, is in 
itself an education. It is one which in time devel- 
ops a sense of relative values that in many cases 
registers surprisingly accurate estimates. Best
-P-A-G-E-162

of all it is an education within the reach of all 
of us.” 
Therefore you are to bring to your contempla- 
tion of the tuneful art a mind open to impressions. 
Clear the road of the conviction that it is hard to 
understand, and that your ignorance of musical 
tweedle-dees renders you incapable of liking it. 
Listen to the kind of music you think you will 
like, follow the most familiar path, and the way 
will: open up before you without any conscious 
effort on your part to force it. 
This mistaken notion. that we should know all’ 
about music before trying to like it is as wrong . 
as it would be to apply that to painting, but there, 
too, it is imperative that we follow familiar paths. 
Pick out pleasant landscapes, homey interiors, 
subjects that appeal to you in themselves. Paint- 
ings like that you are bound to enjoy, and it would 
' probably not occur to you to say, after looking at 
one you had enjoyed, ‘‘I don’t understand it,’’ 
simply because you have no technical knowledge 
of the art. You would be quite satisfied with the 
pleasure it gave you. And in that sense the paint- 
ing would have fulfilled its esthetic mission. 
Of course practice in seeing pictures, just like 
hearing much good music, will make you more 
hypercritical. You will gradually ‘‘appreciate’’ 
or learn to like certain modes of expression on 
canvas that at first you couldn’t abide, and your 
growing familiarity will enable you to discover
-P-A-G-E-163
162. PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
faults where before you had seen perfection. In 
any case no one can take away from you the en- 
joyment painting or any other art may bring you. 
That enjoyment is absolutely your property, and 
while increased knowledge may give you a differ- 
ent outlook, your emotional reaction after. all is 
Said and done is its own reward. 
So forget to think that you cannot ‘‘appreciate”’ 
‘tnusic without ‘‘understanding’’ it. Submit to 
its wiles, let yourself hear it whenever and wher- 
ever you can, and understanding and appreciation 
of it will follow as naturally as the moon does the 
sun. . : 
Familiarity with music does not breed contempt, 
‘the most convincing proof of this being the pres- 
ent day concert audiences. These are getting 
larger and more enthusiastic in city and small 
town and the two reasons for. it are the phono- 
graph and the player-piano. The mechanical 
reproduction of music has made good music 
familiar to thousands of people where there was 
but one music lover before, and no other argument © 
but this one is needed to show that all music re- 
quires to become popular is to make it. known. 
Let us trace the history of a musicless: household 
into one that becomes a perfect music center, and 
all through the lure of the phonograph. 
This family never used to have a sound of music 
in the home. -Then someone decides to buy a 
phonograph. At first it is looked upon as a new
-P-A-G-E-164
WHAT EVERY HOME SHOULD HAVE 163 
plaything, a rather lively piece of furniture, and 
that is all, Probably a dozen or so of records 
were given by the dealer to make his sale more 
attractive. The family plays these over and over, 
paying little heed but simply using the phono- 
graph as a comfortable background for conversa- 
tion. No one thinks of really listening, and natur- 
ally the music makes no impression. 
But some member of the household, getting 
tired of the worn out tumty-tum, sets out to buy 
one or two new records. Perhaps the dealer offers 
some good advice this time, perhaps the compre- 
hensive record catalogue has been dipped into. 
Anyway one or two records by some well known 
artist, we will say a violinist like Mischa Elman, ~ 
creep into the home repertoire. These records are 
_ liked. Somebody suggests getting another Elman 
record. ‘‘The tone is so sweet.’’ This is done. 
Who is Elman anyway? They become interested. 
Presently Mischa of the gifted fiddle bow is an- 
nounced to give a concert in that town. The whole 
family wants to go, and does. The program is 
eagerly scanned. Will he play one of their pieces? 
Yes, there it is!’ And in the course of the program 
possibly one or two more of their favorites crop 
up.as encores. How they do enjoy them. They 
are old familiar friends and the enthusiasm of 
hearing these pieces carries over into everything 
else the artist plays. Itis wonderful. The family 
has a magnificent time. And yet the chances are
-P-A-G-E-165
4 164 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
that before owning the phonograph only one mem- 
ber of that family, and very likely none, would 
have even thought of going to a concert. 
_ They go-home elated. Some other records must 
be bought. They get something by another violin- 
ist to see if he can possibly compare with their 
Mischa. Oh yes, the Russian violinist is actually 
one of their friends by this time, and so the story 
goes. It’s easy, this music appreciation. It comes 
without any effort if you will just let. it take its 
natural course, instead of trying to produce it by 
some hot-house process that has ‘‘must’’ and 
‘uplift’? for its high signs. 
‘That is the way to take music. As a joy and 
‘recreation. Hiveryone must have some of both. 
And the ideal recreation is the kind that takes the 
mind off one’s work and produces a kind of pleas- 
ure that leaves one mentally and physically buoy- 
ant' and refreshed. And all this music does. 
Many of the most successful business men this 
country has produced have not been afraid to come 
out in print and to attest to this fact. And yet it 
is surprising to some people that a hard-headed 
‘business. man would dare to express himself so 
enthusiastically about an art. It sounds so dan- 
gerously like a sentimental pose, they think. And 
we should like to be thought anything but: that. 
It is this very attitude, however, that has made 
us au inarticulate people afraid of our feelings, 
and still more afraid to give them utterance. It
-P-A-G-E-166
WHAT EVERY HOME SHOULD HAVE 165 
isn’t done just for fear of appearing sentimental. 
We shrug our shoulders at honest emotion and 
pretend that it is a thing quite foreign to our 
makeup. We hide what we feel under an exterior 
of calmness or indifference, and consider that we 
have thereby accomplished one of the aims of 
twentieth century civilization. We have. 
To possess outward control of our emotions is 
one’ way of making the wheels of life turn more 
easily. But there is one danger—and that is that 
constant denial of our feelings is apt to stultify 
the emotional impulse in us, thereby rendering it 
nugatory. The result is that we become inarticu- 
late. 
The war roused us as a nation and as individ- 
uals. But nowhere did our slow awakening un- 
dergo more of a transformation than as regards 
our attitude toward the national anthem. We 
blush to confess (or do we?) that we have had to 
be told what to do and how. That we have waited. 
until a National Anthem Etiquette Book should 
be placed in our hands with thé principal rules 
marked, is in itself a fact both Indicrous and 
pathetic. . : 
That we are running true to form now—that 
is most of us—is due to the energetic efforts of 
our National Etiquette Committee. It was self 
appointed. That our education is not yet com- 
plete is proved in any public gathering when 
thoughtless persons still wander down the aisle of ’
-P-A-G-E-167
166 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE : 
an audience room to the strains of ‘‘Oh, say can 
you see,’’ and here and there careless ones chatter. 
The end of the war had come before we had 
learned consciously to recognize that the national 
anthem is a sacred thing and that its lofty senti- 
ments deserve our highest respect. We have 
always known this. But it was just our happy- 
go-lucky heedlessness that pushed our conscious- 
ness of all this back into a nice little corner where 
it lay undisturbed and unused. It was the clarion 
call of war that brought it to light. 
And it is the clarion call of the new era that is 
making us proud of the arts, and proud to express . 
our appreciation. If music is not yet a familiar 
guest it is at least a welcome stranger, improving 
upon acquaintance. To be sure the average host 
and hostess do not feel quite at home while enter- 
taining this guest, and there is much that still 
needs to be learned, but music as a general social 
favorite is coming out a winner. What else can 
you find that so readily may be all things to all 
men? Music entertains, it is a recreation, it 
brings comfort in time of sorrow, .it cheers, it 
solaces, it draws the family together in supplying 
a common interest, it relaxes the tired brain, and 
in fact, it will do exactly what you ask of it. | 
It is the one thing that every home should have.

CHAPTER XV- 
THE BUSINESS OF MUSIC 
The time is coming when music will play a 
more important part in the affairs of men than 
books, 
. —Thomas Edison. , 
The father’s objection to his son taking up 
music as a profession is rooted in two lines of 
experience. The one is the unspoken (or shall we 
say outspoken) antagonism to the art arising from 
the father’s own musicless youth, which has 
already been described from different angles in 
earlier chapters. The other objection lies in the 
irregular conditions surrounding music as a 
business. 
The long-haired apostles of harmony who affect 
flowing ties and eccentric behaviour to hide their 
vagaries and their weaknesses, not to mention, 
often, their ignorance, have become so fixed in the 
popular mind as being representative of the pro- 
fessional musician, that the sane, short-haired and 
clean-collared gentleman who actually does pre- 
dominate in the music world today has not yet 
succeeded in fixing his portrait in the public con- 
sciousness. Perhaps he is not so picturesque as 
the other. Perhaps he is too regular as a type to. 
be thoroughly exciting. Something bizarre is still

associated in the public mind with music-making 
and there are still enough scattered charlatans 
who help to keep this superstition going. 
And then the women who predominate at many 
music functions are still inclined, as a whole, to 
take their ‘‘artist’’ a bit hysterically. Not that 
they will admit it, but it is decidedly noticeable 
at a fashionable morning musicale, for instance, 
that the foreign looking gentleman who lets his 
feverish temperament leap out at you inspires a 
like feverish response to his performance, whereas 
the perfectly tailored, straightforward, clean cut 
American gets just a decorous response. We are 
beginning to learn, however, that our own men 
and women can compare with anyone in the world 
and yet we still accept their success with a grati- 
fication that has in it an element of surprise. 
That is why father, quite naturally, also labors 
under the delusion that being a musician is syn- 
onomous with a bad shave and he wants none. of it 
for his boy. Aside from the fact that the pursuit 
of music will have a feminizing influence (so. he 
believes) just see what it will make of his son! 
_No wonder father objects. 
The music profession is undergoing about the 
same transformation that the stage had to under- 
go, and still is undergoing in the eyes of some 
people. The antagonism to the actor was so deep 
rooted that it has taken innumerable shining ex- 
amples to prove it ill-founded. With music it is
-P-A-G-E-170

the same. And-~the mistaken conception of the 
present day man musician is most vociferously 
expressed by the men who stay away from con- 
certs and all other opportunities to hear music, 
and consequently know not whereof they speak. 
Much of the approbrium attaching to the pro- 
fessional male musician these persons have 
brought upon themselves in the past, not only by 
eccentricities of manner and appearance, but in 
being weak-kneed specialists instead of useful 
and substantial citizens. Many a musician has 
rather prided himself on‘ not voting and in taking 
no interest in civic matters or any public ques- 
tions. He has been inclined to hold himself aloof, 
and to leave the solving of practical problems 
affecting the community to those men who were 
by nature and business inclined to take an active 
interest in practical ‘affairs. 
In like measure musicians have neglected to 
understand and practice business principles. For 
that reason many have failed to receive due mate- 
’ rial reward. The unstable condition of the musical 
market is another argument apparently in favor 
of the father who wants his boy to gd into a 
“‘real’’ business or profession. 
While these lamentable conditions are still much 
in evidence, a tremendous movement for better- 
ment has been going forward in the last ten years, 
and new standards have come in with a perfectly 
clean collar and short hair. The big men of the
-P-A-G-E-171
170 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
profession are proving that you can be a great 
interpretative artist, or even a composer, and yet 
be on speaking terms with a fashionable tailor. 
And with a sane adjustment to a regular appear- 
ance there has come about an equally sane and 
business-like view of the profession by. outsiders. 
The men of our own country today who are digni- 
fying the musical profession as teachers and 
artists are of the finest type of American man- 
hood. They are honorable, honest and substantial 
citizens. They are financially successful, and they 
are proving that music may be a business of which 
anyone can be proud. 
The modern musician is educated and cultured. 
He can discuss the big questions of the day with 
a politician far more glibly than could the latter 
discuss the Beethoven symphonies. He visits art 
exhibitions and reads the latest books. His eyes 
are open to what is going on in the world about 
him, and he uses what he can of human activities 
as they touch him in order to make his own work 
finer, broader, bigger. Of course there are many 
' small fish in the music pond who think that by 
flirting their tails and making a loud noise they 
can put over their pseudo-musicianship. And 
there are still, and probably always will be, many 
of those creatures commonly supposed to be born 
every minute who will accept these pseudoists at 
their own valuation. But so are there shyster 
lawyers and charlatan doctors, and they and the
-P-A-G-E-172
THE BUSINESS OF MUSIC 171 
musie fakirs will continue to live and thrive as 
long ‘as there are gullible persons ready to feed 
them. 
Faking has had a freer reign in music than i in 
other professions because there is no law in the 
land, up to the present time at least, that prevents 
anyone who wishes to do so from hanging out his 
shingle and calling himself a professor of music. 
And gullibility, vanity, and false ambition strew 
his path with roses. 
But it should again be emphasized for the bene- 
fit of Dad and his boy that all this is changing, 
and changing rapidly. Music as a business is now 
a going concern in which anyone can succeed who 
brings to it enough natural talent and due prepara- 
tion. You would not expect your boy to succeed 
as_a lawyer or a doctor without the right educa- 
tion and the special aptitude and: liking for his 
chosen profession. The same is true of any other 
line of work, including music. 
The changing attitude toward music as a relaxa- 
tion is another item worthy of thought. It is no 
longer a feminine frivol, a high brow and rather 
ladylike pastime. No indeed. Our American men 
are just beginning to discover music for them- 
selves. They are commencing to accept it as.a 
legitimate recreation quite on a par with cards or 
pool. It is altogether the thing now for men.to 
go to concerts, and to go, moreover, because they 
want to go, which is the only way they enjoy it.
-P-A-G-E-173
~ 172 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
It is a new recreation. Where no forcing process 
is employed men easily learn to like music. 
Where the Tired Business Man is dragged to a 
symphony concert by friend wife because it will 
uplift his soul, he naturally rebels. He wishes 
people would leave his soul alone. He not only 
does not listen to the music when he gets there, but 
inwardly spends his time thinking how much more 
comfortable he would be at his own fireside, with 
‘his old slippers, the evening paper and his pipe. 
. Or he sees nothing in this. ‘‘highbrow stuff’? and ° 
knows the only thing he can enjoy is a ripping 
musical comedy. In any event music in over- 
symphonic doses does no good. But where men 
are let alone to follow out their natural born in- 
clinations, where the mechanical instruments and , 
the home musicians make him familiar with music, 
where no uplift sign drives to antagonism, then 
_ your Tired Business Man becomes a music fan in 
spite of himself. / 
In every city where popular priced concerts 
have been established these affairs have grown in 
number and invariably boast a rapidly growing 
patronage. And the percentage of men present is 
-constantly on the increase. In fact certain artists, 
notably violinists, attract. many more men than 
women. This bears out the statement made in an 
earlier chapter that men are more musical than 
women. They know what they like and there is 
no funny business about it. Man is a pretty direct’

animal when it comes to pleasing himself. And he 
reacts to melody as do the savage and the child. 
He enjoys an emotional thrill and i ig not afraid of 
indulging it. 
Woman’s attitude, for the most part, is more 
complex. In the first place her ability for emo- 
tional reaction has very mistakenly been carefully 
educated out of her. She is not so honest as men 
in her conviction of what she likes or doesn’t like, 
but watches, with wary eye, which way her neigh- 
bor,.the cat, will jump before she jumps herself. 
She wants to be quite sure that this or that is the 
thing to admire before she commits herself. There 
is a lot of tom-foolery in her process of adjusting 
her esthetic standards, and meanwhile much of 
beauty is irreparably lost. While the man—well 
you know what he thinks about esthetic standards. 
He knows what he likes! 
- The father’s second objection to music as a pro- 
fession is rooted in his objection to the study of

tion is obsolete in face of the revolution in music. 
study. It. was maintained and proved in Chapter 
‘ X that music as now taught in our public schools 
is one of the best. mind-trainers and that it has 
real value as a socializing influence. How often 
we hear the remark: ‘‘I should like to have my 
boy learn to play so that when he goes away to 
college it will help him to make friends.’’ There 
you have it in a nutshell. ‘‘It will help him to
-P-A-G-E-175
174 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
make friends.’’ It brings wider sympathies, helps 
to make your boy’s environment more pleasant 
and to increase his influence. 
It does not soften but makes him quicker to feel 
for and with others, refines his nature, makes him 
a human being and not a machine. Music study 
makes him, in*short, an all round man. He will 
make the most of his opportunities, he will dream 
dreams and carry them through, and will be un- « 
selfish rather than selfish. A certain youthful 
buoyancy will be the key-note of his life. A hope- 
ful optimism rather than a hopeless pessimism 
, will guide his steps. Through the study of music 
as a profession or through the proper use of it as 
a recreation, he will become a better citizen and a 
_- finer, bigger man. 
Must we not believe that the perception of the 
beautiful—a gift we all possess—has been given 
to us for'some purpose? Is there any justification 
for the prejudice that would pass it by as some- 
thing utterly useless, something quite outside 
practical life and no concern of the successful 
man? We are finding out that the most successful 
men are the ones who are leaning on ‘music as a 
live factor in their success. They are beginning 
to give music its due. : 
All industrial plants and big business corpora- 
tions are encouraging music organizations among 
their employes. They find it the most stimulating 
of recreations. They are, in many cases, using
-P-A-G-E-176
THE BUSINESS OF MUSIC 175 
musie as an accompaniment to work. Why? It 
makes for increased efficiency. The contagion of 
rhythm is the pulse of life. 
We dance to music, eat to music, sing to music; 
- why not work to music? 
Music is the dynamic force of successful indus- 
try. If the strains issuing from a brass-throated 
band of rooters can work a south-paw up to a 
wild pitch of nervousness, what is to hinder real 
‘musie from arousing lethargic laborers to a high 
pitch of enthusiasm? Work accompanied by 
music is never hard. In war it was proved that 
music made even murder easy. Generals screwed 
up the courage of their men with music by the 
regimental screw-driver known as the band. | Ob- 
viously, if music can take the sweat out of sweat- 
shop the principle that harmony makes burdens 
light and work easy is susceptible of wide appli- 
cation. 
So it would seem that the business of music is a 
subject worth your attention. Your boy may take 
it ‘up as his particular business and provided he 
brings to it a special talent and the proper equip- 
ment he will earn through it the success that is 
represented by eminence and dollars. Or he may ~ 
make it his business simply in the sense of its 
being a by-product to his success in another line 
of activity. As an avocdtion music will be an in- 
valuable aid. It will help him in selling bonds or 
setting a broken limb or trying a big case, for it
-P-A-G-E-177

176 | PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN: TUNE. 
will make him a broader individual, more keen in 
his perceptions and more thoroughly alive. The 
man. whose emotional nature is atrophied is half - 
dead. The man who is not ashamed of having 
‘‘feelings’’ is the man to bank on in any emer- 
gency. . . . : 
This idea of making music an integral part. of 
your preparation for coping with what the fates 
may have in store for you is not new.. Plato 
preached it hundreds of years ago to the extent of 
dividing a boy’s education up to sixteen years of 
age as follows:»-The first ten years to be used 
‘toward forming his disposition, then three years 
of grammar with collateral sciences, and then 
three years of music. In other words, just as 
. gymnastic exercise is necessary to keep the body 
healthy, exercise in music is necessary to keep the 
soul healthyFrom this one would judge that the 
proper development of the intellect and the proper 
control and use of the emotions cannot be accom- 
plished without the study of music. 
And so, Mr. Business Man, in case you may look 
upon Plato as an old fogy, let us repeat here the 
dictum of our own Thomas Edison: ‘‘The time 
is coming wher music will play a more important 
part in the affairs of the world than books.’’ 
Why then not use it for all it is worth in helping 
your boy to real success in the game of life?

CHAPTER XVI . 
MUSIC AND OUR NATIONAL LIFE 
‘Chant me the Poem that Comes from the Soul 
of America. . . 
. —Walt Whitman. 
Musicians have been for the most part a sorry 
lot of hide-bound specialists, everlastingly occu- 
pied in. repressing the natural function of music, 
thereby preventing it from asserting itself as an 
important factor in social evolution. And yet is 
there a single human activity on which music does ~ 
not touch? From the quiet of the nursery to the 
clatter of the factory, from the gay boulevard 
enlivened by the military band to the romantic 
seclusion of a love song, from the brilliant lights 
of the theater to the sombre shadows of the 
church, everywhere music pursues us and modifies 
the complexities of our modern existence. It 
touches us at all times in all places. . 
Consider the cheapness of music, and its acces- 
sibility. Great paintings require long purses and 
wonderful galleries, and although these may be 
thrown open to the public free of charge, some- 
body pays for them. But a singing group of two 
hundred factory workers can make the greatest 
choruses ever written their own! You may have 
right at your own hearthstone the most wonderful 
177
-P-A-G-E-179
178 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
music interpreted by the world’s most famous 
artists. And through the magic of reproduction. ‘ 
you may have all this for almost nothing. But the 
most economical music on record is probably the 
supposedly divine music heard by Confucius, the™ 
Chinese philosopher who lived 3000 B. C. The 
heavenly harmonies had such a wonderful. effect 
upon him that he partook of no food for three 
months afterward. If only a bit of this music 
were available now-a-days, how it would reduce’ 
‘the high cost of living! 
The universality of music is proved by the fact 
that the more people get of it the more they want. 
But the supply seems equal to the demand. Every 
social institution is answering the call. 
There are our public libraries for instance. A 
regular music department has been installed in the 
larger city libraries, and in a measure the libraries 
- in smaller towns are following suit. The typical 
music department of our city libraries is a verit- 
able music world itself. Here are to be found the 
complete scores of nearly all the standard operas 
and oratorios and a large collection of music in 
sheet form. The well-informed attendant can help 
the elub woman or the music student in the study 
of almost any phase of music. There are musical 
periodicals and books on music, as well, to refer 
to. : 
For obvious reasons the music in sheet. form - 
cannot be put into circulation so it is available for
-P-A-G-E-180
MUSIC AND OUR NATIONAL LIFE - 179 
reference only at the library itself. But the bound 
volumes may be taken home like any other books. 
This sort of thing has become invaluable to teach- 
ers, parents and students, and makes available to 
“them any amount of music it would not be feasible 
for them to own themselves. The generous patron- 
age bestowed upon these music departments wher- 
ever they have been installed proves what a need 
they are filling. 
The growth of music’s power in the church 
is another manifestation of the appreciation of 
music. The time is not beyond the memory, of 
many of us when many a rural community was as © 
horrified by the innovation of installing an organ 
in the church as though the devil himself lurked in 
the pipes. The artificial expansion of their simple - 
gospel singing into something more complex and 
artistic, although possibly not more impressive, 
was an idea to which our grandfathers had to : 
_ learn to adapt themselves. 
There are those who hold, and rightly, that this 
elaboration of the musical part of the church 
service has been the deplorable means of causing 
it to lose its personal character. We have learned 
te listen instead of taking as active a part in it 
ourselves, and this tendency is very marked in the 
slump suffered by congregational singing, We are 
much inclined to let the highly paid choir praise 
the Lord these days while we sit by in mute appro- 
bation, rather helpless accessories to the act.
-P-A-G-E-181
180 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
But something must be said for all this on the 
other side. The highly trained choir, the profes- 
sional soloist and the talented and learned organist 
and musical director make it possible for us to 
hear in our ehurches today music that was 
undreamed of by our forefathers and there is no 
question that although we are but passive listeners 
to all this beauty, its influence is uplifting and 
inspiring. 
Movie music is another factor to be reckoned 
with, and one to which the public school teachers, 
special teachers of music and parents should all 
give some attention. Everybody goes to the 
movies. Or. at least everybody’s neighbor does. 
And the music has become one of the big assets in 
the attractiveness of this omnipresent form of 
entertainment. It is being used as a real box- 
office Inre which is a positive proof of its value in 
the eyes of the calculating manager. Of two mov- 
ing picture houses in the same location and prac- 
_ tically of the same class in every respect, the one 
offering a good orchestra will be much more 
eagerly patronized than the other. One needs 
only to go to a show where the orchestra or the 
individual player is using good taste and judg- 
ment, and there can be heard on all sides the ex- 
clamations of satisfaction and delight that the 
appropriate music calls forth? 
The right music makes the’Sad part sadder, the 
tender scenes more tender, and the happy moments
-P-A-G-E-182
‘MUSIC AND OUR NATIONAL LIFE — 181 
still happier. The daring feat becomes realistic- 
ally thrilling, the horrible deed almost unbearably 
grewsome, and the mysterious power of evil un- 
cannily potent. Who can deny that under such 
conditions a picture must appear much stronger? 
“Why,” remarked a woman movie fan, ‘‘appro- 
priate music would simply revolutionize moving 
pictures.”’ ‘‘And,’’ said someone else, ‘‘I’d 
rather not have any music than some of the stuff 
they give us.’’ It will not be long before all enter- 
prising directors will definitely tackle this prob- 
lem and will conspire with musicians for the pur- 
pose of solving it. 
Now because you and your neighbors and your 
children and the neighbors’ children all attend the 
movies more or less it concerns you very directly 
what music is being played. And it.is altogether 
desirable that pressure be brought to bear for 
improvement wherever that is found to be neces- 
_ sary. . 
In one town an enterprising music supervisor 
‘in the public schools has hit upon a novel plan. 
She is trying to do what all good supervisors are 
doing, to make good music attractive from the_ 
first grade through high school. At the end of 
each month many of the selections studied are 
given ‘to the movie orchestras with the request 
. that they use them when possible. This is a 
splendid means of distributing good music and 
says this enterprising supervisor: ‘‘Children are \
-P-A-G-E-183
182 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
very happy when they find their work functioning 
outside of school.’’ 
The relationship of the Woman’s Club, both 
musical and general, with the music life of the 
community is naturally a very close one. _ It is 
entirely in line with such a club’s activities to con- 
cern itself with what the local board of education 
is doing for music, to bring into existence a music 
department in the local library, or if one is already 
there to see’ what improving it needs, to investi- 
gate movie theater music, and of course to link up 
all. these activities with music in the home. The 
woman’s club is also an active factor in all local 
musical enterprises and much of the growth of 
community music is due to the impetus given it 
by the woman’s club. 
Community music whether it be the ‘‘sing’’ or 
a community orchestra, or both combined, has the 
saving grace of being something the people do 
themselves instead of allowing themselves to be 
entertained by others. It is the same creator 
spirit that fills the kindergartner with bursting 
pride when he beats the drum in the ‘‘kinder- 
band’’ or makes your boy march with bounding 
step and beaming eye as a member of his school 
band. ‘Community music is for and by the crowd. 
The crowd of which Traubel says: ‘‘The scholar- 
ship of the world has never made enough of the 
_erowd. Nor have the master classes in any of the 
arts or in trade ever done it. Nor has the crowd
-P-A-G-E-184
MUSIC AND OUR NATIONAL LIFE 183 
itself done it. In fact, the crowd has belittled 
itself. Yet all starts with the crowd. You can’t 
getaway from it, because the crowd is funda-~ 
mental. For after all even the top men in the 
crowd are of, by and for the crowd, whether they 
know it or not.’’ 
Crowd music expresses itself much better in the 
general sing, usually dubbed ‘‘community,’’ than 
in any other way. And the tendency to so indulge 
the feelings is coming to be a fairly popular accom- 
plishment. But still only fairly. In many quar- 
ters it has been aggressively agitated as a wise 
.and valuable mode of procedure making for uplift 
and all that sort of thing—which, of course, scares 
nearly everybody to death and is apt to defeat the 
very end it has aimed to achieve. As a nation we 
are still extremely self-conscious about these 
things, and when we know ‘that we are being 
dragged to a certain place for the sole purpose of 
. opening our mouths to sing we are so painfully 
aware of the impending operation that ‘our love 
for music is apt to ooze out of our very finger tips. 
_ In the foreign quarters of large cities results 
have been wonderfully successful as far as intro- 
. ducing the community sing is concerned but it is 
a-totally different proposition when our real 
natives are subjected to this process. Brave 
attempts to inoculate the purely American part of 
the community with a now-let’s-get-together-and- 
sing spirit usually require a leader who could
-P-A-G-E-185
184 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
galvanize a row of cigar store Indians into life. 
Such occurrences, however, are becoming fre- 
quent. Five thousand persons were brought to- 
gether in Schenley Park, Pittsburgh, with a com- 
mand to sing. A writer in Musical America, de- 
scribing the occasion, said: ‘‘Some of them sang 
well, some sang poorly, and some sang tenor, but 
sing they all did and to get five thousand persons 
-in Pittsburgh to open their mouths for something 
besides food and drink is.a hereulean task.’’ 
. A very successful experiment has been carried 
out in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that is distinctly 
novel and seems to be hitting the nail on the head. 
They had been simmering and stewing about. com- 
munity music there for a long time without actu- 
ally getting anywhere until the director of the 
Civic Musie Association worked out a plot with 
the manager of a leading moving picture theater. 
The people, gathered there for quite another pur- 
pose, found themselves confronted with the words 
of a song thrown on the screen, a persuasive song- 
leader up in front and the sound of a familiar tune 
to urge them on. Ina minute they were at it, heart 
and soul, and from all accounts could hardly be 
persuaded to stop for the picture part of the show. 
This is a straw pointing out at least one direction 
in which community singing might very naturally 
and easily develop. 
In New York City the appropriation of $70,000 
for municipal music was cut to $17,000. A new
-P-A-G-E-186
MUSIC AND OUR NATIONAL LIFE 185 
mayor, having municipal music considerably at’ © 
heart,.made up his mind to change the state of 
affairs and appointed a commissioner of munici- 
pal music and told him to find a way to improve 
the situation. The commissioner decided to use 
the bands of the fire, police and other city depart- 
ménts and enroll them at once for a series of free 
concerts, In the summer these concerts were 
given right on the steps of the City Hall. 
Most writers talk about crowd and crowd-music 
as if we were just discovering it. In a sense that 
is.true. But at the bottom, and outside certain 
_YTecent experiments, it is a revival rather than a 
discovery. Music is now being applied to the 
crowd in a way never tried before. The crowd is 
the instrument which is being made and tuned, so 
that in time it can be played upon for the entire 
world. \ 
Community interest in music is achieving other 
results. Baltimore, Maryland, has gone on record 
ag the first city to make its symphony orchestra a 
municipal affair, and the leading business men 
of Baltimore say it has advertised their city ‘out- 
side of Maryland more than anything else that 
has happened there. The Civic Music Associa- 
tions of Chicago.and New York have accomplished 
wonders in settlements and various music centers 
toward bringing music education. and beautiful — 
concerts to the people—all of which links up 
* éosely with the music of our public schools. Even
-P-A-G-E-187
186 MUSIC AND OUR NATIONAL LIFE 
‘organized labor has stepped in and announces its 
hearty ‘support of any codperative enterprise 
whereby musie may become a more active com- 
munity factor. ‘‘You can count absolutely on the 
support of organized labor, because organized 
labor is fundamentally interested in securing the 
best education facilities for the children of the © 
people,’? says the secretary of the Educational 
' Committee of the American Federation of Labor. 
Just as we have music with us in all of these 
definite lines of activity so we have it with us 
in our hours of relaxation and recreation. It has 
always been used at the theater to fill the be- 
tween-act time, while people are getting seated at 
public gatherings, and generally as an accompani- 
ment in all kinds of places and all sorts of cir- 
cumstances. But this is not the true function of 
‘music as a factor in our playtime. Its real use 
comes to the fore only when it is an important 
adjunct or the sole purpose of our recreation. In 
the latter sense we either make it ourselves in 
our own homes or in public places with our fel- 
lows, or, we use it as a recreation by listening to 
others such as. great artists, orchestras, ete. 
As an adjunct to our recreation it crops out 
in spontaneous tunefulness. at the banquet table, 
at club meetings, anywhere where men are friends 
and the spirit of good fellowship holds sway. If 
there are women present this is less likely to hap- 
pen for the women apparently act as a deterrent
-P-A-G-E-188

or as a distraction. Now that prohibition has de- 
scended upon the land music must shoulder a far 
greater social responsibility than ever before. It 
has to be the cocktail of the occasion, Men as a 
rule drank for the spirit of conviviality and com- 
radeship that came with it. It meant a letting 
down of barriers, a thawing of reserve, a general 
genial expansion. Now it is up to music to prove 
it can supply all this hilarity without the head- 
ache. And it can. The innate desire.to express 
- good fellowship must find some outlet and the 
jolly song that everyone knows will supply it. 
People are happy when they sing and the more 
they will do of it, the more surely it will become a 
popular stimulant. 
Singing in the home, which at present seems to 
have been killed by a process of over-education 
resulting from self-consciousness, will return. 
Presently the parlor will be as full of harmony 
as the kitchen end of the house where Katy at 
the washtub works to a jiggy Irish tune and 
Sadie Africana over her cooking shouts her 
“‘spirituals.”’ 
Our inarticulate selves shall become articulate 
through music of our own making. The ideality 
native to us may thereby come to its most beauti- 
ful expression, and music will attain its rightful 
place in the life of the individual, in the life of the 
community, and in the life of the state. ,
-P-A-G-E-189
CHAPTER XVII 
EVERY MAN HIS OWN TUNING FORK 
Music is a national necessity. 
—Thomas Edison. 
. Conversation about ‘the music of the spheres,’’ 
on being ‘‘in tune with the universe,’”’ and similar 
phrases carry with them a vagueness that renders 
their immensity altogether nugatory. But when 
some one asks: Are you in tune with your sur- 
roundings? Do you harmonize with your environ- 
ment?—then ‘we are getting down to brass tacks. 
Do you then, fit into your environment, or are 
you a square peg in a round hole, vainly trying to 
overcome the eternal dissonance of your exist- 
ence? If that is the case, find your own keynote, 
vibrate to it and proceed to get the most out of 
life! 
There is going on about us continuously a 
process of clashing vibrations, minute particles 
fighting each other with a persistence that is 
eternal. And however accustomed we may be- 
come to this wearing down process, we must watch- 
fully bear in mind that it is just that—an expendi- 
ture of destructive and not constructive force. 
The interminable clatter of the inappropriate 
may lull us to sleep, but says Chesterton, ‘‘when 
an appropriate thing happens it wakes us up like 
188
-P-A-G-E-190
  re EVERY MAN HIS OWN TUNING FORK 189 
the pang of a perfect chord.’’ It is like the silence 
in the country at. night. More awful, more in- 
tense, more loud to the city child than the thunder- 
ing traffic of the streets in a human bee-hive. But 
to come back to that perfect chord. Just think 
how it sets us vibrating, what a degree of re- 
sponsiveness it wins from us! 
v Vibration is the first or primal expression of 
energy, and an understanding of the orderly laws 
of sound will open up a whole new world of beauty. 
This realm of sound when subjected to the en- 
lightening process of the science of acoustics, 
quite loses its air of mystery, and becomes at once 
a simple array of definite facts. To the scientific 
mind all is law and-order.. An authoritative 
knowledge of a certain subject makes the most 
wonderful processes of nature serve as a lesson, 
‘a guide, an example. 
A sound is defined as an air disturbance which 
reaches the ear, and causes the sensation of hear- 
ing. .A noise is-a sound too brief or too irregular 
to. have an assignable pitch. 
A tone is a sound continuing uniformly for an 
appreciable time and having an assignable pitch. 
Vibration is the moving to and fro, or oscilla- 
tion, of a body or the particles composing a body. 
The pitch is determined by the number of vibra- 
tions in a given period of time. 
‘When the number of vibrations per second is
-P-A-G-E-191
190 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
greater than thirty and less than thirty-two thou- 
,sand, certain delicate tissues of the ear vibrate 
“in sympathy, o or respond. These vibrations ex- 
press as sound, and we hear. When the number 
of vibrations per second is greater than two hun- 
dred and eighty-two trillions, and less than one 
and one-quarter quadrillions, the organs of sight 
respond. These vibrations express as light, and 
we see. 
Until separated into its component parts by 
means of a prism, light was considered a unit. 
By experiment tone was found to be composed of 
numerous partial tones, just as light is made up 
of colors. 
The distinctive, individual quality of a tone is 
4 determined by the relative intensity of its par- 
tials. We may hear sounded the pitch known as 
middle ©, and, without seeing the medium used, 
will recognize the tone as coming from the piano, 
or the violin, or cornet, or a tenor or contralto 
voice. In each case the proportionate loudness 
of the partials varies, resulting in the particular 
tone quality that makes that tone different from 
every other and this introduces us to the wonders 
of tone-color. — 
Just as innumerable tints may be formed by a 
varying proportion of the primary colors, so an 
infinite number of qualities follow the combina- 
tion of partial tones in varied proportions. A 
simple tone (one sounding few or no partials
-P-A-G-E-192
EVERY MAN HIS OWN TUNING FORK 192 
above the first) is free from roughness, therefore 
agreeable, but has very little carrying power and 
is dull, particularly at low pitches—for example, 
the tuning fork, the wide-stopped Bourdon-like 
organ pipe, and the low notes of the flute. 
A fone composed of a moderately loud sequence — 
of partials up to and including the sixth is con- 
sidered musical. The piano, an open organ pipe, 
the softer tones of the human voice, and to a lesser 
degree, the French horn offer familiar examples. 
‘When the first partial predominates the tone qual- 
ity is rich, when higher partials predominate the 
quality is poor. 
Now, these coldly scientific facts may be of 
wonderfully fruitful application if rightly used. 
They may revolutionize human beings. Every 
one, by listening attentively to a continuous tone, 
may learn to distinguish the first six partials. 
He may learn promptly to recognize the medium 
of expression, even where that medium is closely 
allied in character to another instrument. The 
multicolored, composite tone of the orchestra may 
be: separated into its component parts. The 
trained listener has already accomplished this, to 
a certain extent atleast. But it should more gen- 
erally be made a part of the ear training of a 
child.’ - 
To‘ become a nation of music lovers, we must 
become a nation of selective listeners, and this . 
trainmg cannot begin too soon. This is one of 
hs Ms
-P-A-G-E-193
A 192 PUTTING YOUNG AMERICA IN TUNE 
the most important angles of music application. 
How to accomplish it was described in Chapter IV. 
All matter is responsive. It vibrates in sym- 
pathy toa certain key-note, and having once re- 
’ sponded, the habit, as it were, grows (if the sound 
is persisted in), the vibrations becoming more and 
more responsive. You strike a note on your piano 
that calls forth an answering sharp vibration from 
some part of the chandelier in the middle of the 
room. That tone, sounded repeatedly, will result 
in an increasingly louder vibratory answer. A 
glass vibrates to a certain pitch—the tone, if per- 
sisted in, will eventually shatter the glass! 
And not only inanimate objects, but every Bving . 
thing responds to its own keynote. 
The fire chief of a certain small town owned a 
dog which was a model of decorous behavior, ex- 
cepting when the fire bell rang. Then he would 
set up a howl of derision. The fire chief declared 
his dog knew that bell, and could distinguish it 
from all others. This was scoffed at, but one day 
the dog proved the truth of his master’s conten- 
tion. The funeral of a prominent citizen meant 
the ringing, in quick succession, of all the church 
and other large bells in the town. The dog was 
watched. He made no sound during all the din 
until the clang of the fire bell rent the air. 
_Promptly came his howl in response to its vibra- 
tions. 
Responsive vibrations create the desire to ex-

press oneself. It is psychology. applied uncon- 
sciously. The farmer who plods along in the same 
old way, his slipshod manner of living but a dull 
gray path of hopelessness, who jerks along to 
market in the same rickety wagon, and at the vil- 
lage store meets his familiar cronies-who are but 
replicas of himself, who. spits at the stove and 
sententiously remarks, ‘“‘I guess -what’s good 
enough for me is good enough for the children,”’ 
needs waking up. 
His vibrator is all run down. 
A trolley line is built past his door. What hap- 
pens? This new element in his drab existence 
starts something in him to vibrate, creates the de- 
sire to express himself, to be different, to have 
more from life. The chickens and pigs that used 
the front yard as a rendezvous are penned up 
somewhere out of sight. The yard is set to rights. 
Some flowers appear. The fence is mended. A 
small porch is built on the front of the house. 
The boards that held up the barn door vanish and 
hinges once more give it an air of well-being, and 
presently the man himself emerges a new creature 
—in tune with his improved surroundings. 
_ The theory of responsive vibrations, while it 
has newly found its scientific explanation, is not 
by. any means a thing of yesterday. Pythagoras 
used it as a basis for his musical scale, and Plato 
held: that ‘“‘education in musie is of the greatest 
importance, for more than anything else rhythm
-P-A-G-E-195

and harmony make their way into the inmost parts 
of the soul.”’ : 
These wonderful laws of sound are as old as 
’ ereation, but, in their application to individuals, 
as new as the dawn. Scientists may prove the: 
facts. It is up to us to live them. 
Find your own keynote, respond to it, and life 
will deny you nothing.

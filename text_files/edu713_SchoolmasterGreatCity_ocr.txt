CHAPTER I 
THE BACKGROUND 
I 7 
I REMEMBER sitting with the family and the neigh- 
bours’ families about the fireplace, while father, night 
after night, told us stories of the Knights of the 
Crusades or recounted the glories of the heroes of 
proud Italy. 
How he could tell a story! His voice was strong, 
and soft, and soothing, and he had just sufficient 
power of exaggeration to increase the attractiveness 
of the tale. We could see the soldiers he told us 
about pass before us in all their struggles and sor- 
rows and triumphs. Back and forth he marched 
them into Asia Minor, across Sicily, and into the 
castles of France, Germany and England. We lis- 
tened eagerly and came back each night ready to be 
thrilled and inspired again by the spirit of the good 
and the great. 
Then came the journey over the sea, and the family

with the neighbours’ families were part of the life of 
New York. We were Little Italy. 
I was eleven before I went tofa city school. All 
the English I knew had been learned in the street. 
I knew Italian. From the time I was seven I had 
written letters for the neighbours. Especially the 
women folk took me off to a corner and asked me to 
write letters to their friends in Italy. As they told 
me the story I wrote it down. I thus learned the 
beat of plain folks’ hearts. . 
My uncle from whom I had learned Italian went 
back to Italy and I was left without a teacher, so one 
day I attached myself to a playmate and went to 
school; an “ Anterican” school. I gave my name, 
and my age and was told to sit in a long row of 
benches with some sixty other children. The teacher 
stood at the blackboard and wrote ‘‘ March 5, 1887.” 
We all read it after her; chanting the sing song with 
the teacher. Each morning we did the same thing, 
that is, repeated lessons after the teacher. That 
first day and the second day were alike, and so were 
the years that followed. “If one yard of goods 
cost three cents how much will twenty-five yards 
cost?” If one yard costs three cents then twenty- 
five yards will cost twenty-five times three cents or 
seventy-five cents. The explanation could not vary 
or it might not be true or logical. 
But there was one thing that was impressed more 
 
-P-A-G-E-9
The Background 3 
strongly than this routine. I had always been a 
sickly, thin, pale-faced child. I did not like to sit 
still. I wanted to phy, to talk, to move about. But 
if I did any of these things, I was kept after school 
asa punishment. This would not do. I had to get 
out of the room and frequently I endured agonies 
because the teacher would not permit me to leave the 
room whenever I wanted to. Many times I went 
home sick and lay abed. 
Soon I discovered that the boys who sat quietly, 
looked straight ahead and folded their arms behind 
their backs, and even refused to talk to their neigh- 
bours, were allowed the special privilege of leaving 
the room for one minute, not longer. So I sat still, 
very still, for hours and hours so that I might have 
the one minute. Throughout my whole school life 
this picture remains uppermost. I sat still, repeated 
words, and then obtained my minute allowance. 
For ten years I did this, and because I learned 
words I was able to go from the first year of school 
through the last year of college. My illness and the 
school discipline had helped after all. They had 
made my school life shorter by several years than it 
otherwise might have been. 
The colony life of the city’s immigrants is an at- 
tempt to continue the village traditions of the mother 
country. In our neighbourhood there were hun- 
dreds of families that had come from the same part 
   
-P-A-G-E-10

of Italy. On summer nights they gathered in groups 
on the sidewalks, the stoops, the court-yards, and - 
talked and sang and dreamed. In winter the men 
and boys built Roman arches out of the snow. 
But gradually the families grew in size. The 
neighbourhood became congested. A few families 
moved away. Ours was one of them. We began 
to be a part of the new mass instead of the old. 
The city with its tremendous machinery, its many 
demands, its constant calling, calling, began to take 
hold. What had been intimate, quaint, beautiful, 
ceased to appeal. 
I went to school, father went to work, mother 
looked after the house. When evening came, in- 
stead of sitting about the fire, talking and reliving 
the day, we sat, each in his own corner. One nursed 
his tired bones, another prepared his lessons for 
the morrow. The demands of the school devoured 
me; the work world exhausted my father. The 
long evenings of close contact with my home peo- 
ple were becoming rare. I was slipping away from. 
my home; home was slipping away from me. 
Yet my father knew what he was about. While 
the fathers of most of the boys about me were put- 
ting their money into business or into their houses, 
mine put his strength, his love, his money, his com- 
forts into making me better than himself. The 
spirit of the crusaders should live again in his son. 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
  The Background 5 
He wanted me to become a priest: I wanted to be- 
come a doctor. : 
During all the years that he worked for me, I 
worked for myself. While his hopes were centred 
in the family, mine were extending beyond it. I 
worked late into the nights, living a life of which my 
father was not a part. This living by myself tended 
to make me forget, indeed to undervalue, the worth 
of my people. I was ashamed sometimes because 
my folk did not look or talk like Americans. 
When most depressed by the feeling of living 
crudely and poorly, I would go out to see my father 
at work. I would see him high up on a scaffold a 
hundred feet in the air and my head would get dizzy 
and my heart would rise to my throat. Then I 
would think of him once more as the poet story 
teller with the strong, soothing voice and the far 
off visioned eye, and the poet in his soul would link 
itself to mine, and would see why on two-dollar-a- 
day wages he sent me to college. 
Proud of his strength I would strengthen my 
moral fibre and respond to his dream. Yet not as 
he dreamed, for when he fell fifty feet down a ladder 
and was ill for a whole year I went to work at teach, —~

The principal under whom I did my first teach- 
ing was one with whom I had studied as a pupil in 
the grades. He was opening a new school and 
welcomed me cordially. Leading me to a class- 
room he opened the door and pushed me in, saying, 
“ This is your class.” Then he vanished. 
There were sixty-six children in that room. Their 
ages ran from eight to fifteen. They had been sit- 
ting there daily annoying the substitutes who were 
sent to the room and driving them out of school. 
The cordial reception I had been given by the prin- 
cipal held more of relief for himself than of kind- 
ness for me. 
That first day passed. The last few straggling 
boys filed out an hour or so after school hours. One 
of the biggest boys whom I had detained for disorder 
stopped long enough on his way out to ask, “‘ Coming 
back to-morrow?” 
“Yes, of course I am coming back. Why do 
you ask?” 
“Well, some of them come one day and some 
come two days. To-morrow will be two days.” 
This boy did not know me. My one strong point 
was discipline. I knew little of subject matter, peda- 
gogy or psychology, except a number of words that 
had never become a part of me. I had one notion
-P-A-G-E-13
  The Background 7 
that was strong — discipline. That was the idea. 
Had I not been kept after hours to study my lessons, 
slapped for asking my neighbour for a pencil, made 
to kneel for hours for absenting myself from school, 
for defending my rights to the teacher? Had I not 
been marked, rated, percented all the ten years of my 
life in school ? 
Discipline then was the basic idea in teaching. 
You made pupils do what you wanted; you must be 
the master. Memory, and those who ought to have 
known, preached discipline. It was the standard 
for judging my work as a teacher. My continuance 
in the profession depended upon discipline. 
At least there was no conflict of aim. Since disci- 
pline was the thing, I would discipline, and I did. I 
oppressed; I went to the homes; I sent registered 
letters. I followed up each infraction of rules re- 
lentlessly. There was no getting away from me. I 
was making sure that the children were punished for 
their misdeeds. 
I followed the truants into their homes because I 
wanted relief from a principal who sent me a note 
every time my attendance fell below a certain per 
cent. I visited the parents to complain of the work 
the children were doing, because the principal said I 
must hold their noses to the grindstone. 
I seemed to say to the children, in the words of 
Edmond Holmes, “ You are to model yourself, or
-P-A-G-E-14
  8 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
rather I will model you, on me. What I do, you are 
to learn to do. What I think, you are to learn 
to think. What I believe, you are to learn to 
believe. What I admire, you are to learn to ad- 
mire. What I aim at, you are to learn to aim at. 
What I am, you are to learn to be.” 
At the end of my first month I was an assured suc- 
cess. My discipline of the class and the prompt- 
ness with which I followed up the absentees gained 
recognition. I was promoted from teaching a 
fourth-year class to a fifth-year class. The new class 
was made for me especially because I was efficient. 
It was composed of all the children that the other 
teachers in approximate grades did not want. They 
were fifty misfits. Y 
The room given me was the corner of an assembly 
room, shut in by rolling doors. The benches were 
long affairs and were not screwed to the floor. A 
writing lesson could be conducted only when the desk 
which formed part of the seat in front was turned up, 
so that it became the desk for the seat behind. No 
hour went by but some boy or girl of the fifty man- 
aged to upset one of the desks; then the papers 
would scatter, and the ink would flow on the new 
floor Some of the children would laugh; others 
would howl, and my best friend in the front seat 
would stand on his head. This he said was in prep- 
aration for the time when he was to become a

tumbler at the circus. Judging from the hardness of 
the bumps his head got he was undergoing rather 
severe training. 
\ Discipline — my favourite word — why, discipline 
was failing, failing terribly. If I kept the children 
after hours they would not come to school the next 
day until they had made up the time that I had taken 
from them. If I went to their parents, the parents 
simply said they could not help it; they knew that 
these were bad children. They seemed to feel sorry 
for this mere slip of a boy who used up his after- 
noons and evenings calling upon them. 
Discipline, discipline! It was no use. I tried to 
say again, “ You are to model yourself, or rather 
I will model you, on me. What I do you are to 
learn to do/ etc.”” But somehow the words would 
not come. Discipline, my great stronghold, had 
failed for I had come into contact with those who 
defied discipline. 
What wasI todo? I began to tell over again the 
stories I faintly remembered having heard in the 
days when father sat and talked and we listened, not 
daring to move lest we lose a syllable of what he 
said. I told them about my own childhood in the 
mountains of Italy, about midnight expeditions when 
we loaded the mules with provisions and carried food 
to our friends, the last of the Bourbon adherents. 
ih told them about a wolf that attacked the sheep at

night until my father seized and killed it bare- 
handed. 
< When I related these stories they listened. They 
“hardly breathed. Each day I would end so that 
more could be expected. Then I began to bargain 
with them, trading what they liked for what the 
schools said they should have. I bribed them with 
promises of more stories to come if they would be 
“good” and do the work assigned. 
The struggle was between the child and the 
/teacher, and the struggle was over the facts of the 
curriculum — the children refusing to learn and the 
teacher insisting that they must. But discipline was 
restored, and victory won, by bargaining. 
Woe to the boy or girl who transgressed and thus 
prevented the telling of the story. No arithmetic, 
nostory! Nosilence,no story! The children from 
other classes asked to be changed. They too wanted 
stories. I had them by the hundreds, for as soon as 
I had caught the interest of the children the stories 
of adventure gave place to the old hero tales. 
Discipline once more was my watchword. 
ee Then a new trouble arose. I had been teaching a 
/}year when “ Methods” became the school watch- 
| ! word, and everybody set about learning how to teach 
arithmetic, spelling, history and geography. Each 
teacher had his own methods and supervisors going  
-P-A-G-E-17
  The Background It 
from one room to another were puzzled by the va- 
riety. 
The principal restored order out of chaos. A 
method book was written. Every subject was 
treated and the steps of procedure in each were care- 
fully marked out. A programme of the day’s work 
was prescribed and we were expected to follow the 
stated order. Inspection by the principal and other 
supervisors was based on these. 
I heard the teachers talk of these things as imposi- 
tions. When I failed to follow directions I was 
severely criticised. I began asking the reason for it 
all. 
Why should I teach history in the prescribed way? 
“Class, open books to page 37. Study the first 
paragraph.” 
Two minutes later. 
“Close books. Tell me what you learned.” 
In such instruction there was no stopping, no ques- 
tioning, no valuation: nothing but deadly, mechanical 
grind. Every teacher and every class had to do 
these things in just this way. 
The spelling routine was worst. Twenty new 
words were to be assigned each day for study. The 
words had to be difficult, too, for through them the 
children were to train their memories — their minds, 
as the principal put it. The next day at a signal the 
children wrote the twenty words in the order in 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  12 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
which they had been assigned, from memory, if they 
could. Papers were exchanged and the children 
were asked to correct them. If a child failed to dis- 
cover an error it was a point against him. The 
names of those who “ missed’ were written on the 
board with a check for each mistake. The pupils 
who failed had to remain after hours and repeat 
the list from memory, accurately as to its spelling 
and sequence. 
This was a fixed procedure which no teacher dared 
modify because the supervisor came around and 
questioned the children as to the accuracy of the 
records on the boards. 
Instead of protesting, the teacher set about ac- 
quiring devices which would give the desired results 
with the minimum of effort on the part of the teacher 
and pupils. It was no longer a question of teach- 
ing. It was simply a question of getting the better 
of the supervisor. 
My method was simple and efficacious. There 
was no place where I could get twenty new words 
with so little expenditure of time and effort as in the 
dictionary. The dictionary arrangement offered a 
valuable aid in itself. I selected two a’s, two b’s, 
etc., until I had the desired twenty. 
The advantages of this scheme were apparent to 
the children. They could more easily remember 
and check up their list when it was based upon alpha-
-P-A-G-E-19
The Background 13 
betical arrangement. The per cent. of my returns 
then became high, and the mental strain on the class 
and teacher was reduced to the minimum. , 
Still the question arose in my mind —‘‘ Why must 
I do this sort of thing?” 
Another year passed before I realised that my 
_ fellow teachers were talking about Education, the 
Y Science of Education and its principles. It appeared 
' that in the universities were men whe could teach a 
man why he taught and how to do it. There was 
one thing I had learned and that was the insufficiency 
of my equipment as a teacher. Discipline, boss 
standard, was nerve taxing and not altogether pro- 
ductive. 
Il 
After two years of teaching I found myself no- 
where, and was depressed. I questioned the value 
of my services to the children. The work I did was 
not its own criticism but was judged by some one 
else whose standard seemed to be capricious, depend- 
ing upon his humour and my relation to him. I 
felt the need of new ideas and convictions, and I de- 
cided to go to the university to see what those who 
were supposed to know had to tell. 
I wondered if my return to college with the de- 
liberate purpose of learning what I wanted definitely 
to know, would prove profitable.
-P-A-G-E-20
  14 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
Toward the close of the year’s work I summed it 
up. First one institution and then another! From 
this professor, and a little later from that, came 
words, words, words. They were all so far away, 
so ineffectual, so dead. I was disheartened. 
The next year, however, I came upon the thing I 
needed. This was a course with Dr. McMurry and 
the text-book used as a basis of discussion, was 
Dewey’s Essay’ on “‘ Ethical Principles.” 
Here were strange and new words to use in re- 
lation to teaching. Conduct was the way people be- 
haved, and it had little to do with learning, as such. 
But conduct, not ability to recite lessons, was the real 
test of learning and the sign of culture. 
Conduct furnished the key as to whether the child 
had real social interests and intelligence and power. 
Conduct meant action, whereas school meant pas- 
sivity. Conduct meant individual freedom and not 
blind adherence to formulated dogma. The knowl- 
edge gained had to be used immediately and the 
worth of the knowledge judged by its fitness to the 
immediate needs of the child. 
‘A The greatest fallacy of the child education was the 
“training-for-the-future ” idea. Training for the 
future meant dying for the present. 
Conduct said the child was a being constantly 
active, rarely silent, never a purely parrot-like crea- 
ture. Conduct said the teacher must keep his hands 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
   The Background 15 
off; he must watch and guide; he could not force; he 
could not drive. He could put the problems but the 
children themselves must solve them. 
The disciplinary habit was a matter of action on 
the part of the children rather than one of silent 
obedience; judgment was a matter of applied knowl- 
edge and not word juggling. 
Social sympathy was the result of close contact, 
mutual help, common work, common play, judicious 
leadership. Laughing, talking, dreaming even, were 
part of school life, the give and take of the group. 
Conduct always carried the idea of some one else; 
no isolation, no selfishness. 
Then the whole system of marking and punish- 
ment and rewards was wrong. It was putting the 
child on the lowest plane possible. It was prevent- 
ing him from working in response to an ideal. 
I realised then that the child must move and not 
sit still: that he must make mistakes and not merely 
repeat perfect forms: that he must be himself and 
not a miniature reproduction of the teacher. The 
sacredness of the child’s individuality must be the 
moving passion of the teacher. ‘ 
These things I learned from my masters. It was 
a wholesome reaction against my disciplinary idea, 
and a healthy soul-giving impetus to my daily teach- 
ing. 
I had come in contact with the personality of a
-P-A-G-E-22
  16 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
great teacher, fearless, candid, and keen, with noth- 
ing dogmatic in his nature. Under this leadership 
I came in touch with vital ideas and I began to work, 
not in the spirit of passive obedience, but in one of 
mental emancipation. 
There was a new pleasure and much more free- 
dom in my teaching. I went back to the children 
ready to challenge their intelligence, keen to see them 
grapple and solve problems set for them, eager to 
watch them carry into their daily lives the ideas of 
the school. 
I looked back into my own experiences, analysed 
them, built them up, and through them interpreted 
the struggles of the children before me. The God 
of Discipline was replaced by the God of Watchful- 
ness. 
I tried to carry over into classroom practice the 
results of what I had learned. I tried to teach in 
the light of the saner point of view. My super- 
visors objected to the variations I was trying to in- 
troduce into the teaching of history, spelling and the 
rest. 
“You'll find those things may be all right in the- 
ory but they will not do in practice,” they said. 
But I refused to compromise, to yield to beliefs 
merely because I was told to do so or because others 
about me yielded to beliefs and policies. 
Just when the feeling came upon me that I was 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  
  The Background 17 
really beginning to enter into the secret of child 
training the principal came to me and said, ‘* You 
are wasting your time. You are wasting the chil- 
dren’s time. You are totally unfit for this work. 
If I had a son he should not be put in your class.” 
His idea was that, unless you ground children 
down and made them do as you wanted them to, 
they would have no fear and respect for you. It 
was the master and the slave idea. When the 
teacher rebelled the scourge of sarcasm was relent- 
less. 
There were times when I felt that he would have 
been pleased to have lowered my “‘ ratings” to the 
point where I would have been compelled to retire 
from the profession, yet he refrained because he 
too, was compromising with himself. 
When I changed from his educational philosophy 
to mine, his comment was, ‘‘ Why is it you will not 
do as I tell you?” 
What he did not know was that if he had treated 
me kindly and asked for co-operation, allowed me 
some form of self expression, he would have had 
a wealth of enthusiasm to call upon. 
Self respect compelled me to change schools, and 
I went away, every fibre of my being indignant at 
his oppression. 
 
-P-A-G-E-24

The next principal I found lived the doctrine, “I 
serve children.” 
Here was a man who actually loved school chil- 
dren; who enjoyed coming into personal contact 
with them in the classroom, the yards, the streets and 
their occupations. He helped clothe the poor chil- 
dren and feed them, washed the dirty faces when 
he found them, and all with the utmost kindliness and 
in the belief that such service was a wonderful privi- 
lege that had been granted him. All about him was 
the radiance and glow of progress. 
He always told this story with sadness as one of 
the incidents of his school life. A boy had been 
brought to him for habitual lateness and without 
stopping to question him he berated him for his lazi- 
ness while the child stood silent and patient. When 
the principal awoke to the situation he asked, 
“‘ Why were you late, anyway?” 
The boy replied that he had to work till three 
o’clock each morning in order to help the family. 
The principal apologised and made the boy feel 
that he understood and sympathised with his strug- 
gles. 
So he was with the teachers, and with me. 
To each of us he seemed to say, “‘ You are tired,
-P-A-G-E-25
  
The Background 19 
brother, come to me and let me hold your quivering 
hands in my strong, steady ones. Come to me and 
let me stroke your hot, tired eyes with my cool 
fingers. I know what makes you tired for I, too, 
have been tired and worn out. 
(“Sometimes even now, I get tired when I forget 
the bigness of the things I want to do.) Those faces 
that you see in the classroom are not set against you, 
my brother. They are set against. the things that 
bind you and prevent your mind from mingling freely 
with others. 
“You must not think too much of arithmetic, and 
rules and dates and examinations, for these are not 
teaching; the children don’t grow because of them. 
They grow because of their contact with you, the 
best that you know and feel. - 
“Come with me to the open country and let us 
live together for awhile. There we will be silent 
and look into the hearts of children as we do into 
the heart of nature. 
“When we come back the school will be as a new 
world and you will work with the earnestness of a 
discoverer patiently awaiting revelations.” Sy 
The thought of him always makes me feel strong 
and fresh as a boy who runs shouting through the 
cool air of a spring morning. I stretch my arms 
and open wide my eyes and shout the faith that he 
gave me. 
 
-P-A-G-E-26

Promotion came and I found myself in another 
school. There was little of special interest in my 
experience in this place. Placed in charge of a 
graduating class, I was supposed to teach science to 
the boys of the seventh and eighth grades. The 
only way I could do this was to carry whatever ap- 
paratus I needed from room to room. Batteries, 
tubes, jars, pails, water, gas burners followed me 
about. As I passed down the stairs and through the 
halls I looked like a small moving van. In this de- 
partmental system the teacher moved, not the chil- 
dren, because the movement of the children would 
cause too much noise, too much confusion. School 
was the place for silence! 
At the end of two months I moved again. This 
time it was a graduating class in a school on the 
lower west side of the city. The building was more 
than fifty years old. It fitted well with the general 
neighbourhood picture. It was all run down. 
There was a miscellaneous sort of population, a 
mixture of races and colour. The boys lived along 
the docks, in the rear of factory yards where the 
men found employment. 
The first morning, when I announced to the prin- 
cipal that I was a new teacher, he looked at me 
doubtfully and said, ‘‘ Why, this won’t do, you don’t 
want to come here. You are only a boy. You are 
not old enough nor strong enough! The boys in 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  
The Background 21 
that corner room broke the teacher’s eyeglasses and 
he was a bigger man than you are. They threw the 
ink wells and the books out of the window. You 
don’t want to come here.” 
When I saw the assembly a few minutes later I 
agreed with him. I did not want to be there. 
I sat on the platform while the principal conducted 
the exercises. There was scarcely a child in the 
room who was not either talking or chewing gum, or 
slouching in his seat. There was a spirit of unrest 
throughout the monotonous assembly. There was 
nothing about the general exercises that could offer 
the slightest inspiration to either children or teacher. 
Two or three of the men walked up and down the 
room eyeing the boys, and the women, each at her 
place, had their eyes riveted on their classes. 
Yet, in spite of all this close supervision, the chil- 
dren were not behaving as if they were happy or as 
if they liked school. At the end of fifteen minutes 
they were sent to their rooms and the work of the 
day began. What work that was no one could ap- 
preciate unless he had gone through the halls of the 
building and felt the struggle that was going on in_, 
each room. The very walls seemed to speak of 
tension and battle. 
The antagonism between the children and teachers 
was far stronger than I had ever seen it before. 
The antagonism between the school and the neigh-
-P-A-G-E-28
  22 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
bourhood was intense. Both came from mutual dis- 
trust founded on mutual misunderstanding. The 
children were afraid of the teachers, and the teachers 
feared the children. 
The neighbourhood was a place from which the 
teacher escaped, and into which the children bur- 
rowed. One never knew as he went through the 
streets what missile or epithet might greet him. One 
or the other was certain. 
I do not remember a period in my life when I was 
more silent and soberminded than during the first 
six months of my career in this school. Day in and 
day out I sat quietly scarcely saying an unnecessary 
word and by gestures rather thar speech indicating 
to the children what I wanted done. 
I went through the building silent, rarely speaking. 
I looked out upon the streets, silent. I visited the 
shops and listened to the talk of the fathers. I 
visited some of the homes. Here too, I talked lit- 
tle, trying to get people to talk to me. 
The school was failing. I was failing and my 
whole mind was concentrated upon finding the cause 
and the remedy. 
After school hours I would stare out of the win- 
dows and look out upon the strange mixture of peo- 
ple with their prejudices, their sensitiveness and their 
shiftlessness and ponder upon the gulf between them 
and me.
-P-A-G-E-29
  The.Background 23 
There was no attempt on the part of the school 
to understand the problem and to direct the lives of 
the pupils. In fact, teaching the curriculum was the 
routine business of the day—no more. There was 
apparently little affection for the children, and no in- 
terest in the parents as co-workers in their education. 
When the principal assigned the assembly exer- 
cises and the discipline of the school to me, I was 
glad. I had learned to believe in children. I had 
begun to analyse my own childhood ‘more carefully. 
Here was an opportunity to test my knowledge in a 
larger way than the classroom offered. 
I began by telling the boys what a fine assembly 
was like in other schools. Once more I resorted to 
stories. They never failed. Father had done his 
share nobly. The big restless crowd settled down 
and listened. As each day went by, cautiously I put 
the problem of school discipline before them and 
they responded by taking over much of the responsi- 
bility for it themselves. A sort of council was held 
in my room each week at which the problems of the 
school were discussed. From fifty to one hundred——— 
of the most responsible boys in the school attended 
and as there were only about twelve hundred in all, 
the representatives were fairly adequate to the need. 
This experience helped me wonderfully. Through 
it I gained, increased confidence in the children, in 
the power of the school, in myself.

IN THE SCHOOL 
I 
Now came ‘my appointment as principal. I 
stretched my arms and said, “ Free at last, my own 
master! JI am limited only by my own vision.” 
I entered the new school, ‘‘ My school,” as I 
proudly called it. There it was, a big, massive 
structure towering like a fortress above the elevated 
lines, fronting a large public park, the airy rooms 
full of sunshine. 
It did not look out into the back-yards of tene- 
ments. No smell of leaking gas stoves came in 
through the open windows. In other days, if I 
gazed out of a school window I looked into the 
homes of the neighbours — squalid, noisy homes 
they were. Whenever there was a quarrel, the loud 
shrieks and the bad language broke in upon the class- 
room recitation, and made the children blush and 
break into nervous laughter. They were ashamed 
of their parents and their neighbourhood. 
This new school of mine seemed altogether dif- 
24 
 
-P-A-G-E-31

ferent. I looked out of my office window at the trees 
on the hill beyond and watched them sway in the 
wind, like the restless backs of many elephants. I 
saw the open spaces, the sunlight, the park, and I re- 
joiced. These, I knew, were the teacher’s best 
friends. 
The day after my installation I went to my office 
ready to begin on “‘ my school” and carry it up to 
the heights of power and efficiency. ‘‘ My school” 
should come into its own. I do not szemember now 
whether I intended to accomplish this in a day or a 
month, or a year, for as I sat thinking about it the 
half-past eight gong rang sharply, insistently. It 
brought me up-standing in the office door. I heard 
bell after bell beginning in the first room and follow 
in order from floor to floor, shrill out its call, cease, 
pass on its message to its neighbour in the next class- 
room to pass it along to the next, like a chain of 
energy linking up the classrooms for the day’s 
work. I had never heard anything quite like that 
before. 
Then came the measured rhythm of many feet. 
From six entrances the children surged through the 
halls and into their classrooms. I had a blurred im- 
pression of sound, and colour and motion and many, 
many children and teachers all going swiftly by. I 
saw no individual faces, no distinct forms, just the 
great mass surging past. Stunned and bewildered I

  “26 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
stood where I was until I realised that a great silence 
had settled over the building. The big school 
had begun its day’s work and begun it without 
me. 
I sat down at my desk because I didn’t know what 
else to do. The clerk came in with the mail. The 
former principal who was still in the building with 
the fifteen hundred children he was to take to the 
new school came in to arrange some details of ad- 
ministration. ‘With him I went over the number of 
classes in the school, the teachers who were to go 
and stay, the district lines and the number of chil- 
dren to be transferred in and out. This done he 
walked out of the office. 
I was about to gather myself together and take 
hold of “ my school,” and then the gong rang again. 
I heard doors roll, bells trill, sharp commands, 
rhythmic footsteps, and the great surge of sound and 
colour and motion passed me again, children going 
in, children going out. They moved in classes, eyes 
front, hats off. A mass of children coming in to 
take the places of the mass that was going out. 
There was no time lost, just a tramp, tramp, a roll 
of a door, as it opened, a click as it shut and then 
silence as before. 
The next day was the same —and the next! I 
had not taken hold. I left the office and walked 
through the school, corridors, classrooms and play-  
-P-A-G-E-33
  In the School 27 
grounds listening and watching, trying to get an 
idea here and there. 
I passed the open door of a classroom and saw a 
teacher smiling down at a little boy and all the other 
little boys smiling sympathetically at both. I was 
glad and walked towards the teacher. Instantly the 
smile disappeared, her body grew tense, the little boy 
sat down and all the other little boys sat up stiff and 
straight and put their hands behind them. 
I tried to say something pleasant but I saw they 
were afraid of me and I went away. 
I went into another room and the teacher was in- 
tent upon a little book, she was marking, and at the 
same time telling a boy that she hoped he’d learn 
something about grammar before he died, but she 
doubted it. 
Without lifting her eyes and so missing seeing me, 
she said, “‘ Walter, analyse, ‘Come here.’ ” 
A boy whose thoughts were a long way off jumped 
up and said —‘‘ Simple declarative, Come is the 
subject — here is the predicate verb,” and sat down. 
The class laughed heartily and the teacher said 
as she marked his failure, “‘ Fine — But you forgot 
something — Come is the subject, here is the pre- 
dicate, the period is the object.” 
Everybody laughed. Walter shook himself and 
analysed the sentence correctly. Then they realised 
my presence and froze over. The teacher apolo- 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  28 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
gised for not having noticed my entrance saying she 
thought it was one of the boys and asking me to be 
seated but I saw she was uncomfortable and I left. 
A teacher brought me a disciplinary case. Be- 
fore she could tell me the trouble she burst into 
tears. When I tried to tell her there was nothing 
to cry about she but cried the harder. 
Was she afraid of the new principal? Why 
should she be afraid of him? Yet the scene was 
somewhat familiar. Oh, I remembered— ‘“‘ You 
are wasting your time. You are wasting the chil- 
dren’s time. You are totally unfit for this work. If 
I had a son he should not be in your class.” 
Was that it? 
This was bad. The teachers did not want.me in 
the classrooms. They cried when they came to the 
office. 
I'd make friends with the children. But I could 
not get at them. They were in classes in the rooms 
—in masses in the yards and corridors. Only the 
occasional bad one stood out as an individual with 
whom I could come in personal contact. 
“My Dream School” was not so easy. 
I thought a great deal about the situation. I 
know now that in those first days I interpreted the 
school through my finger tips and eyes and ears 
rather than through my intellect. I saw and heard 
the disorderly boy. I ached physically and mentally  
-P-A-G-E-35
  In the School 29 
over the weak teacher, I saw every mistake she made, 
I heard every faulty intonation of her voice and felt 
a sense of personal injury. Why was she like that? 
Why couldn’t she be big and fine? And the strong 
teacher! Why weren’t they all like that? That 
was the way I wanted them. They must all meas- 
ure up to the best. I rather felt than saw the peaks 
and hollows. 
But in this restless, uncertain sea of motion, noise, 
colour and gongs; of constant going up-stairs and 
down-stairs, one learned to “‘ go slow” and watch 
and wait for his opportunity. 
In my discouragement I told an older principal 
about my efforts and failures. 
“What do you mean? ” he said in a puzzled fash- 
ion. “J don’t understand you.” 
“T’ve tried to have the teachers and children feel 
that I’m their friend, that I’m eager to help them but 
I don’t seem to be able to get them to speak or act 
freely in my presence. They are afraid of me!” 
“ Afraid of you? Of course they are and they 
ought tobe. The teachers and children are all right. 
You'll find them well trained. They will do your 
bidding without question. Take my advice if you 
want any peace of mind and keep them under your 
thumb.” 
These were not the exact words that had disheart- 
ened me years before, but the idea was the same,
-P-A-G-E-36
30 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
and I remembered and understood. There was 
little danger of forgetting, I came upon this blind 
obedience repeatedly. Obedience, the loyal obe- 
dience that was school tradition. 
“TLet’s try to have the children come to school 
fresh and clean,’ said I one day to a group of 
teachers. ‘“ Praise those who come in clean blouses 
and with well brushed hair.” 
Shortly after this a mother came in to see me. 
She laid a little package on my desk. 
“ Please, I bring you back this shirt.” 
Startled, I echoed, ‘‘ Shirt? What shirt?” 
“This shirt that the teacher gave my Jonas.” 
“ Tell me about it,” I said. 
“ The teacher said if they were good and sat up 
tall so that they got ‘ A’ from the Lady Principal she 
would give them a blouse. Jonas told-‘me and I told 
him he should try hard and get a blouse. So he did. 
He tried and tried and got one. But this blouse I 
don’t like. Never I put a thin blouse on Jonas in 
February — only in April. I want you should take 
this back and give him a flannel one —a red one he 
likes.” 
Here she pulled the wrapping off a pretty little 
blue and white cotton blouse, and beamingly pre- 
sented it to me. 
Turning over her story in my mind I remembered 
she had said the “‘ Lady Principal.” I went in search
-P-A-G-E-37
In the School 3i 
of my assistant and handing her the blouse I said, 
“ Do you know janything about that?” 
“No, but maybe I would understand if you told 
me how you came by it.”” 
I told her And she chuckled. 
“Surely that’s Miss North. You said to get the 
children to/come in clean blouses so she talked to 
them daily and when I visited the room she showed 
me the boys I was to commend for neat appearance 
and encourage for their efforts to clean up.” 
“‘Tet’s go in and see the teacher,” I suggested, 
still in the dark. 
As we entered each little boy sat in the middle of 
his tiny bench, each held a primer carefully covered 
in brown paper with a red edged name-paster pre- 
cisely fixed in the centre of the front cover; each 
wore a light coloured wash blouse —(I counted 
seven of the same sort as the one on my desk). 
The sunshine came in through the windows and 
made little rainbows dance above the aquarium where 
the fishes looked as if they’d just been polished and 
put in their places. 
“ How fine you look,” said the Lady Principal. 
“Yes, we’re all dressed for school. Do you think 
we can have A to-day?” asked the smiling teacher. 
“T surely do. They’re the cleanest boys in town.” 
“How do you manage about Jonas?” I asked. 
“He came without his new blouse and I had an
-P-A-G-E-38
  32 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
extra one, so I just slipped it over his other one so 
they’d all be alike. I'll take it off when he goes out 
and keep it for him.” 
The teacher had done her level best to carry out 
the principal’s wishes. If the children would not 
wear clean blouses she would go out and buy them 
herself. If Jonas left his at home she would give 
him an extra one. At all events the principal must 
be obeyed and the class get an “ A” rating. 
“ The teachers and children are all right. You'll 
find them well trained. They will do your bidding 
without question.” 
I 
I could not accept that point of view. When the 
other principal and the group of fifteen hundred chil- 
dren with their teachers went to the new building I 
said to myself, ‘“‘ Now I can do it. We'll have more 
room, we’ll have fewer children to a teacher, I can 
get closer to them all.” 
What a relief from the hurry, the mass move- 
ment. Twenty-five hundred children in place of 
four thousand. The school seemed half empty. 
School hours were again normal, five hours a day, 
each teacher in her own room, no hurry to get out so 
that the next class might come in. Nine o’clock to 
three and as long after three as the teachers cared 
to stay. There was plenty of room to work and
-P-A-G-E-39
  In the School 33 
plenty of opportunity for the teachers to meet and 
plan and develop. 
I called the teachers together and tried to tell 
them what I believed a good school meant in terms 
of children and teachers. I tried to make them feel 
that I was going to take my share of every hard prob- 
lem in the school day. The bad child, the slow one, 
the dirty one, were my responsibility as well as the 
teacher’s and I wanted to help each teacher with each 
one of her difficulties. I told them of the ‘finer 
things I had seen about the school and asked for 
more and more of them until the whole school should 
become a fine place for children and teachers to live 
in. 
The first response to my offer of help was an ap- 
peal from a teacher to discipline a boy. 
The teacher came to the office before the work of 
the day had begun. She entered nervously and stood 
before me like a prisoner awaiting sentence. 
Haltingly she began, “ You said I could come to 
you with a bad boy. Here he is, I can’t do anything 
with him. He’s awful.” 
Then the tears came. I took the boy out of the 
office and waited long enough to give the teacher a 
chance to recover. 
“Now tell me about it.” 
“ He’s a very bad boy. I’ve had him now a term 
and a half almost. He won’t work and he won't let  
-P-A-G-E-40
34 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
anybody else work. I’ve kept him in every day until 
five o’clock but it does no good. He swears in the 
classroom and yesterday he threatened to hit me. 
He’s an orphan. He’s been in the Protectory and 
he’s on parole now. If he goes on I’ll be home sick 
and it’s too bad!” Here she almost cried again. 
“Never mind now, I’m glad you brought him to 
me. He won't give you any more trouble. But 
tell me — Why did you stand this so long? Why 
didn’t you refer him to the office long ago?” 
She hesitated for a minute then said, “I was 
afraid it would be counted against my record and 
I’m up for my permanent license.” 
“ Well, it won’t count against you and I think this 
particular boy won’t bother you again.” 
Smiling faintly she thanked me and went to her 
room, but I noticed it was weeks before the worried 
expression left her face and she could smile without 
effort. 
In every class there is one, at least one, so called 
“bad child.” He comes to the classroom, his brain 
teeming with the experiences of street life. He lives 
at top speed during the hours that he is not in school. 
He is master in the street and in the home, and he 
would be master in the school. He looks at his class- 
mates with sophisticated scorn and at his teacher with 
open contempt. The whole machinery of the class-
-P-A-G-E-41
  In the School 35a 
room must stop while he holds the centre of the 
stage. The teacher struggles desperately to hold the 
class. From the moment the first recitation bell 
rings in the morning until the last pupil closes the 
door behind him at night she must strive by every 
ruse known to the teacher to keep the bad child under 
while she teaches the good children. The strain is 
terrible and out of all proportion. But why doesn’t 
the teacher send the child out of the room and con- 
tinue the work in peace? Why should a whole 
class suffer for one child? 
I made it a point to visit each room at least twice 
a day. As I went the rounds I saw the “‘ bad boy” 
standing in the corner or by the teacher’s desk or 
sitting sullenly by himself where there happened to 
be room. : 
“ What can I do for you this morning? ” I asked 
as I entered each room. 
“‘T wish you would attend to John. I can’t get 
along with him. He is a constant source of annoy- 
ance. He talks and interrupts the lesson. He has 
talked four times in the last hour. I do not want 
him in my room any more.” 
“John, come with me.” John came and I led 
him to the office. 
“ What did you do?” I asked. 
“T talked to the boy next tome. He asked me a 
question and I answered.”
-P-A-G-E-42
36 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
“‘ How many times did you do this?” 
“T don’t know. I talked a lot, I guess.” 
“Why did you disturb the lesson? ” 
“T don’t know.” 
That is the most persistent answer a “‘ bad boy ” 
gives. No matter what the question or how strong 
the evidence against him he holds on as long as he 
can to “I don’t know.” 
“You have got to stop this nonsense,” I said 
finally. ‘‘ There is only one way to get back to your 
class. You interrupted the class work. First you 
must make good your work. Second you must make 
up your mind not to be disorderly again. You're 
wasting your time and that of your teacher and class- 
mates. Sit down there and think it over. When 
you have made up your mind let me know.” 
When John agreed that he had been foolish I 
went back to the room with him and told the class 
how sorry I was that they had lost any part of their 
time and work through John’s disorder. I hoped 
that they would not be troubled again in such a way. 
John had agreed that he had no right to use his 
time and theirs in such a silly fashion. He had 
agreed to make good his work and he would apolo- 
gise to the class for wasting their time. 
A boy, especially a boy who has been master in the 
street and in the home and would be master in the 
school, will not risk being humbled before his class- 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  
In the School 37 
mates. Just as long as his offence is an offence 
against the teacher it is an heroic offence, but when 
it is an offence against the group, the heroism dis- 
appears. 
But just to see what might happen next, John re- 
fused to ‘‘ make good.” The parent was called in. 
It was the father because where John was concerned 
the mother would not do... . 
“T can’t come here about this boy. This is the 
second complaint in three weeks. First my wife and 
now myself. I have lost a day from my work and I 
can’t afford it. What’s the matter now? Your 
teachers are constantly nagging my boy. Why don’t 
you leave him alone? First one teacher and then an- 
other. This never happened until you came to this 
school. I am a taxpayer and I know my rights. I 
want you to put that boy back in his class, and if you 
don’t, I'll go higher up.” 
“ As a taxpayer you should be the last one to en- 
courage wasting school money.” 
“T am, I won’t stand for it. I’m telling you, 
I’m going to the commissioner.” 
“ But your son is wasting it. He’s been left back 
twice now. If we cannot get him to get down to 
work he’ll be left back again, which means you’ve 
paid three times for something for your boy and 
haven’t received it yet. Besides that, he’s wasting 
other boys’ time and they'll be left back and you'll  
-P-A-G-E-44
38 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
have to pay your share for them and get nothing 
either. I’m trying to save John’s school time and 
your money, but if you and I together can’t make 
John see it, I am afraid I won’t be able to do it 
alone.” 
“T can’t make him see it? See here, young man, 
I’m the father of six and I’ve made them all see it- 
Send that boy down here.” 
“ No more trouble with John,” I said to myself. 
Sometimes I found a child under discipline for a 
trifling offence.’ I discovered Mary standing in front 
of the room making believe she liked it. 
I asked the teacher what was the trouble. 
“Chewing gum,” she answered. “I’ve said they 
must not bring it into the room and this morning 
right in the middle of the arithmetic lesson I looked 
down at Mary and her jaws were going sixty to the 
minute so I just stood her there. You can sit down. 
now, Mary.” : 
When I got a chance I asked the teacher if she 
hadn’t got the gum chewing a bit out of perspective. 
“What do you mean?” she asked. 
“ Mary lost her arithmetic lesson, didn’t she?” 
“She surely did and part of her spelling lesson.” 
“ Weren't her lessons very important ? — Weren’t 
they what she had come to school for that day?” 
“ Of course.” 
“ Wouldn’t your end have been accomplished if 
   
-P-A-G-E-45
    In the School 39 
you had signalled to Mary to get rid of the gum 
and handed her an example to work on the board 
‘putting the emphasis on the duty in hand rather than 
on her little offence?” 
“Maybe you're right,” she said, smiling, “ I'll 
think about it that way.” 
When the disciplinary cases had been systemati- 
cally looked after some of the pressure was removed 
from the teacher’s life. Less and less frequently did 
I hear the teacher’s voice pitched to the breaking 
point as she said, ‘‘ Why don’t you behave?” 
Gradually the children began to feel that the 
school was with them and for them and began to as- 
sume responsibility for it. They economised school 
time by arranging and distributing material for the 
day’s work. They began to take care of themselves 
in the halls relieving the teachers of that duty. 
They ceased marking the walls and picked up the 
scattered papers without being told to do so. 
I saw Peter walk across the yard and pick up a 
lollipop wrapper and put it in the can and I re- 
membered the day when the yard teacher had 
ordered Peter to pick up his own luncheon paper and 
Peter had said, ‘‘ That’s what the janitor’s for,” and 
remembering I thought, “‘ My school is moving on.” 
Whenever a problem arose that concerned the 
school as a whole, I put the problem at the school 
assembly and whenever a child responded to the
-P-A-G-E-46
  40 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
school need I spoke of him as one who was serving 
the school. Gradually this thought of being 
““square”’ with one’s classmates was carried out of 
the classroom till it became the thought of being 
“ square ’’ with the school. 
Henry came to school with his face and body 
bruised. I asked him what was the matter. He 
answered some boys had hit him. Upon investiga- 
tion Henry had been present when the “ Flanni- 
gans”’ had tried to search some of our smaller chil- 
dren. Henry had protested and then followed up 
his protest’with force and while the smaller children 
got away Henry “had stayed on the job” as he put 
it and “‘ been beaten up for his trouble.” 
“ My school is getting on,” I thought. 
But was it? That day I stopped to talk to a 
group of teachers who were chatting with my assist- 
ant. 
“Well, at last I’ve got discipline.” One of the 
fifth grade teachers was talking. “I’ve got that 
class of mine to understand what orders mean. This 
morning the clerk came in to ask about the transfers 
of some of the children and said, ‘ Those living south 
of the park raise hands!’ Icountedthem. ThenI 
talked to the clerk about William’s absence. She 
was in my room at least seven minutes. When she 
left I turned to the class and there were those boys 
still holding their hands up — you know the way I
-P-A-G-E-47
  In the School 41 
_ have them do it, elbow bent and hand close to the 
shoulder. I said, ‘ Hands down’ just as if I hadn’t 
forgotten them and went ahead. But I certainly 
_ was pleased. That’s what I call discipline.” 
Discipline indeed! 
Although the emphasis of the discipline was being 
put largely on the individual as against the group, 
what each child owed to the class, what each child 
owed to the school, much of it was still a discipline 
forced by the conditions of the school. The rod 
idea was at work. Books, benches, crowded rooms, 
sitting still, listening; talking only when called upon 
to recite, teaching where the teacher did the think- 
ing; these conditions have meant and always will 
mean an imposed discipline, an imposed routine, 
whereas real discipline is a personal thing, a part of 
the understanding soul. To replace discipline of 
teacher-responsibility by the discipline of child-re- 
sponsibility is a long, slow process.

It was late one afternoon and I walked from room

building and a tired mind! No wonder I felt de- 
pressed. 
In one of the classrooms I saw a teacher still at 
work. She was huddled over her desk, her elbows 
resting on either side of a pile of work, her chin in 
her hands, weariness and depression in every line of 
her body. 
She looked up at the sound of my step and said in 
answer to my quizzical smile, ‘‘ I’m going over the 
work that has been returned from the office.” 
“ Let’s look at it,” I said. ‘‘ It must be very im- 
portant to keep you like this.” 
“Oh, no, I must fix it first.” 
“Fix it? Why you’re through with it, aren’t 
you? The work’s been done, examined, and re- 
turned and that’s the end of it. What more can you 
do with it? You received some criticism upon it, I 
suppose?” 
“ That’s just it. That’s why I must fix it.” 
© “Let me see it,” I persisted. 
Reluctantly she pushed the pile of compositions 
toward me. 
On the inner top sheet, in the assistant’s neat pen- 
manship the criticism was inscribed:

“ Trifles make perfection and perfection is no trifle.” 
Do this set over. a 
I looked up and grinned. A bit relieved the 
teacher pushed another pile of papers toward me. 
“That’s my map. It’s Manhattan and I did 
work hard on it.” 
Carefully ruled along the sides of each white sheet 
of drawing paper was a red ink border. Neatly set 
within this frame was a map of the borough. In the 
lower right hand corner was a little compass sign to 
indicate the directions. All was very, very neat, and 
very, very dead. On the top sheet in the neat pen- 
manship was written, ‘ This is excellent work. A 
great improvement over last month’s set.” 
Upon close examination the compositions were all 
alike. They were written on the same topic. They 
had the same number of paragraphs. They had the 
same sentences. . It was a story on plants; plants 
generally, roots, stem, leaves, as close an imitation 
of a scientific deduction on the abstract life of plants 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
44 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
as it was possible for the teacher to make it. Why 
had they been written at all? There they were, as 
perfect as could be. Not one of them had the child’s 
language or the child’s point of view. Composition 
is thought and then expression. Here there was no 
thinking, no child thinking, just a striving for perfect 
forms. There was neither thought nor language. 
I told the teacher to put the papers away, all of 
them, and go home. She needed the air and the sun- 
shine and what she was doing was of little value to 
the children. 
I determined to look more carefully at this finished 
work of the classroom. 
Some of it I found good. Here and there were 
signs of life, but most of it was deadly perfect. I 
remember one set of drawings in particular, a set of 
cylinders. Each drawing was exactly like the other 
and what attracted my attention most, was the fact 
that they were placed in exactly the same place on 
each paper. A faint memory of the Dictionary 
stirred within me and I chuckled to myself. 
I sent for the teacher. She was a young teacher 
in her first year of service. There were about thirty 
such in the school and upon them I had set my hope 
for the school’s growth. 
“These are fine drawings,” I said, “very neat 
and carefully drawn.” 
She looked pleased. 
   
-P-A-G-E-51
  
In the School 45 
“ T wish you'd tell me how you did them.” 
“Why, the children did them.” 
“ Of course, I just wanted to know how you man- 
aged to get the children to get them all the same size 
and placed so well on the paper.” 
“Oh, yes. You know first they made them all 
ways. Some very long and thin and some short and 
fat and the sides all crooked. And they were not in 
the middle of the paper; just a little up or down or 
sideways, you know?” 
“Yes,” I agreed. “I know.” 
“Well, the drawing supervisor told me they must 
all be the same size and placed correctly on the paper 
so I thought out a way. 
“T took a big needle and pricked little holes in the 
places where the four corners of the cylinder were to 
be and there you are. The rest was easy.” 
“ Anyway,” I said to myself as she left me, ‘‘ she 
told me.” 
It was difficult to get teachers away from subject 
matter, from machinery, and toward children. How 
could it be otherwise? Had not the teachers been 
trained to think arithmetic per cents., language per 
cents., spelling per cents., geography per cents.? 
Was not their world a word-world and their thinking 
a word-thinking? 
I tried to improve the teaching by getting away
-P-A-G-E-52
  46 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
from the accepted treatment of the three R’s. 
These subjects were so thoroughly formalised and 
“logically arranged that no new viewpoint could be 
carried over through them. 
I began by emphasising subjects that held emo- 
tional values, drawing, composition, music, nature, 
literature. I wanted drawing that expressed the 
child and not drawing that was made to order. I 
wanted ideas expressed in colour, movement, fun and 
not lines, ideas and not perfect papers, every one 
alike. TI wanted composition that expressed the 
child and was not made to order; two sentences for 
the third grade, two paragraphs for the fourth 
grade, simple sentences in the fifth grade, complex 
sentences in the sixth grade and so on indefinitely. I 
wanted nature that would make the child’s heart 
warm with sympathy, that would make the child dig 
and plant and be glad of the earth smells, that would 
make him talk to the dumb beasts and yearn to care 
for them, that would make him laugh to feel the 
snow and the rain and the wind beating on his face. 
The feeling for the things that I wanted was 
rather more definite than the knowledge of how to at- 
tain the desired results. I planned, however, as best 
I knew how. I watched my opportunities. I went 
into the classrooms and helped the teachers with 
their work and the teachers, it seemed to me, re- 
sponded. They smiled. They were interested.
-P-A-G-E-53
In the School 47 
They showed confidence in the newer point of 
view. 
“We are getting on,” I thought. 
Then something happened. One of the assistants 
came to me and said, “ I want to talk to you.” Her 
tone signified the unusual and [ listened intently. 
“T must leave this school. You and I do not 
agree. You are putting the whole weight of the 
school on the non-essentials. The teachers are put- 
ting all their energy on music, nature, composition 
and drawing. I can’t get the arithmetic up to the 
standard in the time that’s left.” 
“ Aren’t the teachers giving the allotted time to 
the arithmetic? ” 
“Yes, but they give just that and no more. I 
mean that they do not bring the pressure to bear on 
it that they did and the work is falling off. It’s 
according to your direction and as you and I cannot 
agree on that point I am going to another school.” 
“T’m not getting on,” said another teacher. “I 
don’t know what to do. The Superintendent is com- 
ing and I’m afraid we won't be ready, especially in 
Nature Study. You tell us to work for the chil- 
dren and forget ourselves but we can’t forget the 
Superintendent. I can’t get the facts he wants with- 
out drill and I can’t drill and teach the way you 
say.” 
“ But I believe you can teach, really teach the child 
 
-P-A-G-E-54

to think and enjoy the work, and at the same time 
give the examiner the kind of work he wants,” I 
said. 
“Will you come and hear my nature lesson on the 
Robin?” 
““Gladly,” I said. 
“T give it first thing in the morning,”’ she told me. 
I was on hand promptly. There was no sign of 
anything in the room that looked like a robin unless it 
was the plump little lad in the first seat who kept 
looking up eagerly, open mouthed, into the teacher’s 
face, ready to catch each word. 
“ Now, children, we are going to talk about a bird. 
One you all like to hear about. He’s a cheerful little 
fellow with a brown coat and a red breast, and two 
bright eyes, and he sings, cheerily, cheerily! What's 
his name?” 5 
Silence. 
“Tm afraid you’re not thinking hard, children. 
Think hard. What’s his name? He has a brown 
coat, a red vest, two bright eyes and he sings cheerily, 
cheerily — What do you call him?” 
Then the boy in the first seat spoke up. 
“ Tony,” he said. 
Tony was an Italian sweeper, who unfortunately 
for the smooth progress of the lesson answered the 
description to a nicety. 
The teacher turned to me, her face flushed and 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  
In the School 49 
her eyes shining. ‘There, you see—lI tried to 
make the lesson interesting and that’s what happens. 
I can’t do it your way.” 
“ But maybe that isn’t my way.” 
“Why, that’s what you told me to do. I’m sure 
T don’t know what you mean.” 
“Tf you'll come to me during the day, I'll try to 
tell you.” 
When she came, I said, ‘‘ There are robins in the 
park just across the street?” 
“Yes, lots of them.” 
“Suppose you meet the class under the big Oak 
Tree in the morning and look for robins. Watch 
them until you and the children know as much about 
them as one can learn by looking — size, colour, bill, 
food, the funny little tripping walk, the cock of the 
eye and the turn of the head; the nest and the babies 
you'll have to get from pictures, but having real 
birds in your mind, that will come easy. Then talk 
over what you’ve seen and learned. Let everybody 
say his say sometime or other. ‘Tell them a story, 
have them sing a song about Robin Red Breast. 
“Then when you have all the facts about him 
select those that are most worth while, and present 
them as the Robin story. You'll find you'll need 
~ very little drill.” 
Doubtfully she shook her head. 
As she started to walk out of the room I could 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  50 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
see the shadow of the coming examination still in 
her countenance. 
“And by the way —you know it’s Tony that 
wears the vest—not Robin Redbreast. Don’t 
worry. Outline the lesson again and then come back 
and let me go over it with you.” 
IV 
The average parent thinks of education largely 
in terms of books. The poorer the people are the 
more apt they are to over-value the traditional work 
of the school. The school is the place to learn from 
books and the child must not waste time doing any- 
thing else. Time spent in play is waste. Time 
spent on music, cooking, stories, dramatics, dancing, 
wood, clay, is waste. These are the fads and frills 
and while desirable are altogether unnecessary. 
What the child needs is to get on in the world, to 
get a job that gets him away from hard work. To 
do that the child must know how to read, to write, 
to spell, to count. He need not know anything about 
music, hammers, needles, food. 
Parents have been trained as have the teachers, 
to think of school as a place where the children are 
made to obey, to memorise, made to repeat lessons. 
I felt that we had to win the parents as well as 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
    
In the School 51 
the teachers if the changes we were making, our em- 
phasis on the “ fads and frills”? of education, were 
to be accepted in the homes. 
I should have known that the people believed in 
the sufficiency of the three R’s. They had not re- 
alised that the children of the city were losing all 
chance of first hand experience with life. They had 
not realised that the schools must hasten to furnish 
the opportunity for them on the playground and 
in the shops. Only when there was a better public 
conception of what the schools should do would 
school life really change. 
When I cut down home study so as to give the 
child some relief from the pressure of the curriculum 
and thus allow them more time to grow, Sam’s 
mother came to me, wrath in her eyes. ; 
“Good morning. I’ve just run in for a minute 
this morning to ask how it is that Sam has no home 
work to speak of. Just a few examples and five 
words and a little reading. Sometimes he has a 
couple of sentences. He does them in no time. 
Now in the last school he was in he used to have 
work enough to keep him a couple of hours. He’d 
come in from school, do his errands, wash up for 
supper. After supper he’d work until it was time 
to go to bed.” 
But I protested, ‘‘ We think Sam is doing very 
   
-P-A-G-E-58
  
  52 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
well. There is no need for his working two hours 
at home. If he works to his full capacity for five 
hours a day, that is enough for a little fellow ten 
years old. Don’t you think so?” 
“Well, I don’t know. He doesn’t have enough 
to do to keep him quiet. Hesbothers the family and 
we don’t like it at all. Last night he bothered me 
until I had to get up and get him stuff to make an 
air thing. I don’t know what it is — something he 
wants to make fly. Now he’d be better off doing 
some long division examples, and I think the teacher 
ought to have more to do than tell him stories about 
flying machines anyway. He can learn that when 
he’s older if he wants to.” 
“I’m sorry you feel that way about it. The child 
has all the book study he needs, I think, and if any- 
thing, too much homework. I think Sam needs sun- 
shine and clean sports and a chance in the open. He 
is going to fly kites to get ready for the kite flying 
contest to be held in the park next month.” 
“Then I want you to give me a transfer,” she 
answered with decision. ‘‘ My boy needs an educa- 
tion. He can’t afford to waste time like a rich man’s 
son. I'll put him in another school where he can 
learn something.” 
And nothing I could say would change her belief. 
Aérial navigation was too far from the three R’s for 
Sam. He must stay nearer the earth.
-P-A-G-E-59
  In the School 53 
Even the babies in the first grade, the infant class, 
did not escape. 
“Don’t you find Aaron ahead of his class?” an 
aggressive mother asked me. 
“TT find him a very bright little boy.” 
“Yes, I knew you would. I taught him myself. 
He can read the whole of ‘ The Red Hen’ and count 
to one hundred without a mistake. When are you 
going to promote him?” 
I temporised. “I rather think Aaron can go 
ahead with his class next January.’’ (It was Sep- 
tember.) ‘‘ Yes, if he grows as he promises to, he 
will be ready for promotion with his class.” 
“* But he can read the whole of ‘ The Red —’” 
“Yes, I know, but, you see, the school stands for 
more than just the few intellectual facts that the 
curriculum imposes upon your child. He needs time 
to live, to grow, to be a child with other children. 
He needs time to sense the curriculum as well as 
memorise it. That can only be done by living it 
with his teacher and his classmates. If to teach the 
few facts of the curriculum were all we were here 
for, the school would better be closed.” 
By this time the mother began to feel maybe she 
hadn’t it right, after all, and went away shaking her 
head and sighing. 
“School was different in my time. We learned. 
We got ‘ what for’ if we didn’t.”
-P-A-G-E-60
  54 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
“This is the principal?” puffed a little ball of 
a man as he rolled into the office. “I came to see 
about my boy’s, Fred’s teacher. Maybe you think 
she is a good teacher. I don’t know it. She keeps 
my boy in. She tells him stories. Fred comes 
home. He walks round and round the rooms and 
says words like the actors. Tell her to please stop 
—I don’t like it. I don’t like it.” 
“ Does Fred like it?” I asked. 
“He likes? ”’ and there was fire in his eyes. ‘‘ Yes, 
he likes it like anything. That he likes and noth- 
ing else. Why, if she wants to teach Fred extra, 
don’t she give him more arithmetic. That is good 
for Fred when he grows up. He goes then to busi- 
ness and he knows nothing. Whose fault? Fred 
is not good in his lessons. My brother’s son is two 
classes ahead and he is the same age. Fred should 
study hard. He should not waste his brain on hum- 
bug. Tell her to please stop. Fred needs his 
senses for reading and writing.” 
“ Would you like to see the teacher? She might 
explain,” I suggested. 
“Yes, I will see her. She must not tell stories. 
She must not waste time. Fred will be big soon, 
very soon.” 
The teacher came. 
“You Fred’s teacher?,”’he said as soon as he 
saw her. ‘‘ Well, you must not tell stories, I don’t  
-P-A-G-E-61
  
In the School 55 
like it. I want an education for my boy, not foolish- 
ness. Stories are humbug.” 
“But we have these stories after school hours 
when all the required work is done,” pleaded the 
teacher. 
“Yes, yes, but give him some more examples if 
you want to help him along — but please, my dear 
young lady, don’t tell stories. I don’t like it.” 
Then the grandmother of Katherine came in, a 
hearty, cheery, plump-cheeked, steel bowed spec- 
tacled grandmother, who seated herself with firm- 
ness and began without preface: 
“Why doesn’t your teacher teach the children to 
spell?” 
Her eyes were challenging —the clear, clipped 
tones hinted, ‘‘ No nonsense now, I’m here to be 
shown.” 
“ What class is Katherine in?” 
“ First grade, room 7.” 
“Oh, we do not teach spelling in 1A.” 
“ And well I know you don’t. I’m glad you're 
truthful. Why don’t you? Here Katherine can 
read the whole of ‘The Red Hen’ and not a word 
can the poor child spell, much less know a letter. 
Every night I’m trying to pound it into her, and 
we’re as far from it now’as when we began. What's 
wrong, anyway?” 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  56 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
“You see,” I tried to explain, ‘we don’t teach 
reading just that way. Suppose you spend an hour 
in the classroom and see how we do it?” 
“ Surely, surely, I want you to show me.” 
At the end of the period, grandmother came back. 
“Well, that’s a fine young woman,— and healthy, 
T’'ll say that for her. And the children do read well. 
But J learned to spell when I was six, and it never 
hurt me.” 
“Or helped you,” I thought, but silence was better 
than speech this time, and grandmother went home 
silenced but not convinced. 
The next complaint came from an entirely differ- 
ent source. This time it was Mary Ann’s mother 
who spoke. Mary Ann was in the “ Defectives’ 
Class ” and would stay in that class outside and in- 
side school until the earth closed over her. 
Mary Ann’s mother was a picturesque figure in 
her sport skirt, an antiquated basque with a brave 
row of steel buttons down the front, a pert sailor 
hat sailing under an aggressive quill. In her ear- 
nestness she went directly to the teacher. 
“Teacher dear, Mary Ann’s doing foine, foine. 
She hasn’t tore the baby since I don’t know whin, 
and she’s getting that civil you wouldn’t believe it. 
Hardly a bad word out of*her mouth now, and she 
goes to Sunday School with Bettie. I’m proud and

thankful to ye. But that’s not what I came to ask 
ye. Just drop them’bastits you’re having her mak- 
in’, and them drills she fiddles her time away in and 
teach her to read. Teach her to read so she can 
learn her catechism and save her immortal soul and 
then I don’t care. But in God’s name, teach her to 
read.” 
And Mary Ann’s mother broke down and wept. 
There you are. From the highest to lowest, the 
book and the, book knowledge shall save you. It 
shall even save your soul. 
Many parents believe that this is education. They 
covet knowledge, book knowledge for their children. 
Rich and poor alike want their children done up in 
little packages, ready to show, ready to boast of. 
They fear freedom, they fear to let the child grow 
by himself. Because the parents want this sort of 
thing, the school is built to suit — a book school — 
one room like another, one seat like another, each 
child like his neighbour.

  CHAPTER III 
OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL 
I 
Art the end of the first term the school was pro- 
moted. A mass of children went from our sixth 
year grade to the seventh grade of a neighbouring 
school. A new group from the fifth grade of our 
neighbour’s school was promoted to our sixth grade. 
At the end of the second term the school was pro- 
moted again. We lost the older children upon 
whom the responsibility for school spirit depended 
and we got the younger children in exchange. The 
two groups crossed and re-crossed on their way to 
and from the two schools. 
What could we do with a shifting school popula- 
tion? 
A mother came into the school one morning. She 
wanted “to see the principal.” I was then on my 
rounds of the building. She waited because she 
wanted “‘ to see the principal on very important busi- 
ness.” When I came she began. It was the con- 
crete presentation of, the protest that the teachers 
_ and I had been feeling. 
58
-P-A-G-E-65
  Outside the School 59 
“T’m sick of the name of school. Just see this 
for yourself. Is it reasonable? Is it just? And 
to think that I should live to say such a thing 
with two of my boys graduates of public school and 
one now in high school. But I must say it, I’ve stood 
it long enough. Something has got to be done or I 
shall go crazy. 
“Tt’s this way. I ask you to do something for 
me. Thomas goes to the Jefferson Avenue School. 
He is in 8A. Mary goes to the First Avenue 
School and John, the smallest, comes here. 
“When they come home there is a fight. Each 
one cheers for his own. Last night Mary came 
home with her school colours and Thomas said they 
were no good. Then there was talking and crying 
and Mary lost her temper and she had to be put to 
bed. The father blames me. It’s the same with all 
the mothers on the block. With the children here 
and there we don’t know what to do.” 
Here she stopped and felt nervously about for 
her handkerchief. : 
I recalled the visits of the other parents who had 
come objecting to this same condition. 
“Now I want them to go altogether,” she re- 
sumed. ‘‘One school is as good as another, but 
three is too many. ‘The big child could keep an eye 
on the little one and help herj\ across the car tracks. 
The little one is a bit slow in lessons and if the big
-P-A-G-E-66
  60 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
boy tries to help him he says, ‘ We don’t do it that 
way in our school,’ and then there is more fighting. 
If they went to the same school they could help each 
other. 
“Now I want you to stop this foolishness and put 
them all in the same school. What kind of a family 
will this be, I’m asking you? And that’s not all. 
They go at different times,— I’m getting meals all 
day long. No use going to see teachers. It’s a 
day’s trip. Please transfer them to one school.” 
Here the mother collapsed. This was the longest 
speech she had ever made. 
She was right. The time had come to put a stop 
to this ‘‘ foolishness.” 
“Please transfer these children to the same 
school” and ‘Keep them there!” was a good 
slogan. If that could be done we would save the 
changes of both children and teachers. 
Surely there must be some mistake. It was never 
intended that the smallest children should be shifted 
about in this way. It was never intended that this 
school should be the helpless thing that it was. 
I said to those whom I could get to listen, ‘‘ Unity 
and continuity are the two potent elements in the life 
of the school. The tendency to break up the school 
is not wholesome. I believe the full graded school 
where the school life of the child is continuous is the 
best school for children. I believe the children stay

  / Outside the School 61 
longer in such a school and do the work faster and 
more thoroughly. 
“Do you know,” I went on, “ that this school has 
at present six different distinct, district lines? Is 
there any good reason why this school should not re- 
tain its children through all its grades and pre- 
vent the waste that comes through needless trans- 
fers?” 
The kindly old janitor of the school advised me 
when he saw what I was about. 
“Don’t stir them up,” he said; ‘‘ don’t stir them 
up. I have been in this business for thirty years and 
I have found stirring them up won’t do. If they 
say it is raining, put up your umbrella, but don’t stir 
them up.” 
I did not think the janitor was right. When I 
failed to get my point over I said, ‘‘ They do not 
understand.” 
When parents came to me with complaints, I 
sent them on to the school authorities. ‘‘ The peo- 
ple will explain and the explanation will help,” I 
thought. But the authorities resented being stirred 
up and they did nothing. 
A member of the local board came to see me. 
“What's the matter with you anyway?”’ he said 
rather sharply. “ You’re not playing the game. 
You knew this was a six year school when you came ~ 
to it. Then as soon as you get here you begin stir-
-P-A-G-E-68
  62 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
ring up trouble. You're only a beginner, you'll get 
your full school when your turn comes. If you 
can’t wait, get a transfer.” 
“You don’t understand,” I said, taken aback. 
“It’s for the children I’m asking this, not for my- 
self. This organisation is bad for them. Adjust it 
and I'll take any school you like.” 
“That’s all in your eye. I know better,” he said. 
The protest was useless. I felt that school peo- 
ple were not going to help me, either by convincing 
me that I was wrong or by active assistance when I 
was right. Was I facing the same conditions as a 
principal that I had faced asa teacher? ‘‘ Do what 
you are told to do. Do what the rest are doing.” 
Strangest of all was the fact that they were thor- 
oughly honest in their position. It was the point 
of view. They saw a school for administration. { \ 
saw a school for the “‘ All Around” development of 
children. 
I wanted opportunity for the masses, the best 
schools for the crowds, the best teachers for the 
heaviest load. I thought in terms of service, they 
in terms of tradition. 
The changes that had been pal in the school 
organisation had been made to benefit the older chil- 
dren. The best teachers, the best buildings, the 
smallest classes, the finest equipment were provided 
for the few at the top. There was no top to my
-P-A-G-E-69

school, and there were no facilities of equipment, no 
shops, no gymnasium, no playground — only class- 
rooms. It did not matter whether our children 
stayed in our school or were transferred out of it. 
It did not matter much what happened to the young- 
est children. The tradition in school management 
was and still is that the older children are the ones 
most worth while; that the teachers of these older 
children are the superior teachers; that the principal 
of a full graded school has a higher standing than 
one of a six year school; that the president of a col- 
lege is superior to the principal of a high school. 
Soon the teachers who sought promotion went. / 
into the high school or the full graded school, bes 
cause these schools offered higher salaries and larger 
opportunities for professional growth. 
What chance then had this school of becoming a 
real school? What chance had this school for con- 
tinuity of life? What influence could its training 
show upon the conduct of children? 
What was I to do?

The daily disciplinary records had begun to show 
up the few steady offenders. The same names ap- 
peared with almost the same complaint. 
The worst among them was the leader with his
-P-A-G-E-70
  64 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
gang. I found they had headquarters in a forsaken 
mansion. They had stripped it of any saleable fix- 
tures and used the money for cigarettes, candy, soda, 
carfare and shows. 
Sometimes they had a fight with some of the other 
boys in the neighbourhood. The pitched battles 
took place in the vacant lots and frequently in the 
park. Then there would be a rush of protesting 
parents to the school and the station house. The 
police would charge down upon the contending 
armies and they would disappear across the lots into 
cellars and over roofs. 
What was school to them, when, armed with 
stones and carrying shields made of pot covers or 
old wash boilers pounded flat, they sallied forth to 
attack a neighbouring gang! 
The leader had caught my notice by having had 
numerous charges of fighting made against him. He 
had carried his street battles into the school and the 
teacher and the class had to suffer the consequent 
annoyance and inconvenience. 
The freight yard with its busy traffic had the 
greatest attraction for him. Something was going 
on there all the time. The cars clanging, grinding, 
bumping! The brakemen running along the top of 
the cars, shouting and waving their arms! The 
trucks, the horses, the thrill of an accident, and the 
crowd that gathered about the swift rushing ambu-

lance — here was life. Expeditions, thefts, stolen 
rides, broken limbs, what chances for adventure! 
One night there was nothing to do,—no fruit 
stand to turn over, no pedlar to bait, so he led his 
friends to the freight yard. A mass of bulging bags 
containing malt was discovered. These were cut 
and some of the malt carried away to a cellar 
“ Den.” 
The police traced the miscreants to a fifth year 
class. The officer who came took the ring leader 
and started off. Before they had gone ten feet there 
was a flash of grey, and the boy flew down the hall 
scarcely making a sound and a hurtling mass of blue 
pounded after him. The prisoner was gone. 
A tearful youngster appealed to me, ‘‘ Will you 
please make the Flannigans let us alone? ” he wailed. 
“Who are the Flannigans?”’ I asked. 
“They are a gang of Irishers that fight us. 
Every day they fight us. Last night they lassooed 
my brother and took him to their den and my father 
and the police had to get him out. My father says 
you should get the leader. His name is Flannigan. 
That ain’t his real name either. It’s Arente. He 
is in 2 A.” 
“Tn grade 2 A and you are in 6 B?” 
“Yes, sir. He is big and his gang is bigger. 
They even work. We haven’t any show with them.”

“T’ll have to see about them,” I comforted, him. 
“Tt’s too bad.” 
During the day this lad’s mother came in to see 
me. ‘I thought you were going to see about the 
Flannigans? Issie told you about them this morn- 
ing,” she said. 
“Yes,” I returned, “ but I’ve been very busy to- 
day and haven’t had a chance to see Arente yet.” 
“Then that’s why. On the way out at noon he 
licked Issie for telling you and says he’ll do him 
something if he tells any more.” 
I sent for Arente who promptly dissolved into 
tears. That didn’t help any. Tears came easily 
to him. I sent him home for his mother and asked 
Issie’s mother to wait. Ina short time mother and 
son appeared, and I told the story. 
“ Well,” she said aggressively, ‘‘ this happened on 
the street, didn’t it? What have you got to do with 
it? I guess if you attend to your job inside school it 
will give you enough to do.” . 
“ But,” interrupted the other mother, “ he licked 
my Issie.” 
“Sure he did,” responded the plumed lady, “ and 
serve himself well right. Let Issie fight his own 
battles. I don’t come here about what happens my 
- son. If he gets a black eye that’s his bad luck. 
What happens on the street is none of the school’s

business. You needn’t send for me to settle your 
son’s scraps,” and she swept grandly out. 
“No wonder he licks Issie,” gasped the remaining 
visitor. ‘ She’s fierce. Try and do your best for my 
boy that he isn’t killed.” 
I agreed to try and showed Issie’s mother out. 
Then I sat down to think it over. I consulted 
Arente’s teacher about the street fights. She 
laughed heartily at me —‘‘ What, a sixth year boy 
complaining about a second year boy! He doesn’t 
belong in a public school with the boys. He needs a 
nurse and a perambulator.” 
“ But for some reason or other,” I interposed, 
“ Arente is backed up by some older boys, really 
young men, and it isn’t exactly a fair fight, you see.” 
“Tt happened on the street, didn’t it?” she in- 
quired in a puzzled tone. ‘“‘ What have we to do 
with it? We can’t control the street life of these 
children. We couldn’t if we wished to, and it’s 
really none of our business. 
“Tl speak to Arente but it won’t do much good. 
If Arente doesn’t beat Issie somebody else will. On 
the street, it’s lick or be licked. How’s the school 
going to help it?” 
“How indeed,’ I wondered. “It’s not the 
school’s business. We stop at the street door. It’s 
not the home’s business. That stops at the door.

“Mrs. Wenc wants Fritz to come in the front 
door so Michael can’t punch him.” 
“So,” I said to myself, ‘‘ My school’? is differ- 
ent? Well, it isn’t. It’s the same old school. The 
teachers and children — the streets and the troubles 
have different names but they’re the same all over 
the world. Home shuts the door and by that simple 
action closes out the world. School shuts the door 
and concerns itself no further. But the street roars 
on, its life at full tide, sweeping the children by our 
closed doors.” 
Ethical Principles! The old questions clung to 
me with all the tenacity of a first impression, ‘‘ Is 
the teacher responsible for what the child does out 
of school? If this is not the teacher’s province how 
can the teacher ever know that her work counts in 
the life of the child?” 
III 
I had met a few, a very few parents who had 
come into the school on rare occasions. They had | 
come for the most part objecting to something the 
school was doing. But what of the great mass, who 
were they? 
There were parents who were ignorant, almost, 
of the school’s existence. Some of them did not 
know the teacher’s name, nor the child’s class, nor 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  70 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
the number of the school. They hardly knew where 
the school was. Perhaps they had sent a neighbour 
to register the child in the “baby” class and had 
never been near the school. What did they know 
of the school? What did they care? 
What did we know of their homes? What did 
we care? 
We would know, we would care, I determined. 
We would go to them and learn what was beyond 
their closed doors. 
There was Hyman. He was dirty, more than 
dirty. Word was sent home that Hyman should 
have a bath. No bath was given. Dirt reaches a 
climax. It did in this case. 
Then the teacher said, ‘‘ Hyman, if no one else 
will wash you, I will. But washed you must be.” 
Hyman led the way cheerfully. There was a 
short journey through crowded streets, a dark hall- 
way, long flights of stairs, then Hyman’s home. 
The living room was kitchen and dining-room as 
well. Hyman’s mother was at the tubs. On the 
table in one corner was a cut up chicken, the night’s, 
dinner; close to the chicken was a pair of newly 
mended shoes. There was a loaf of bread with the 
heart pulled out of it and a dish of butter showing 
finger marks. Odd dishes, a coffee pot with streaks 
of coffee down its sides and some freshly washed  
-P-A-G-E-77

clothes filled the rest of the table. Children’s 
clothes were all about. 
There were five school children in this family. 
Each on his way from school dropped his belongings, 
helped himself to a chunk of bread and a dab of 
butter and made for the street, the only available 
place to pursue his right to “‘ life, liberty and the pur- 
suit of happiness.” 
“Yes, I know, teacher,” said the mother limply, 
“T know Hyman is dirty. He won’t wash for me. 
Maybe he will for you.” 
Through the kitchen into the bathroom went Hy- 
man and his teacher. The bathroom was the family 
store-room. Everything was there that anybody 
discarded — a couple of hats, an empty box or two, 
shoes, old clothes. These were piled on the floor, 
the tub cleaned and Hyman with the teacher’s help 
got into the bath, the first in many days. 
Then the teacher went home, thinking, ‘‘ What’s 
the good of school, just school, to Hyman? He 
needs to grow. He needs to learn to be clean more 
than he needs to learn to spell. Congestion, tene- 
ments, dirt, neglect! What chance has Hyman to be 
a fine American citizen? ” 
“T want to tell you about a home I visited yester- 
day,” a teacher said. “ Percy hasn’t done any real

work since he entered my class so I thought I’d call 
on his mother. She made an appointment for me 
and I went. She was dressed as though for a party 
and when I apologised for detaining her she said, 
‘Oh, not at all. It’s my bridge club day but it’s early 
yet. What about Percy? Bothering you? Chil- 
dren are a bother, aren’t they? How do you ever 
get on with forty or fifty of them? One kills me.’ 
“Percy isn’t doing any school work,’ I said 
bluntly. ‘He acts as if he needed sleep too. He 
never does his homework.’ 
“* Oh, Mercy! What’s homework? Lessons? 
Of course he doesn’t do any at home. Isn’t school 
enough?’ 
“*Tt is for some boys who work. But Percy 
works neither at home nor at school.’ 
“*M'm. It’s too bad. You see we entertain a 
lot. We are fond of having our friends about us; 
good for children to meet people, don’t you think? 
Gives them an air.’ 
“© But does the child sleep?’ 
““* Oh, of course, you silly child, he sleeps. Let 
me give you a cup of tea. No? Maybe you'd have 
a cocktail? What can one offer a school marm? 
So glad to have seen you. Thanks so much for your 
interest in Percy! He comes from a good family. 
He'll come out all right. Don’t worry. So glad. 
Good-bye.’ ”

Then there was Ruth. The teachers found her 
untractable at times because of an overwhelming de- 
sire to take control of the classroom. On the whole 
she was worth while and intelligent. What was the 
trouble with Ruth? 
Ruth was ten and very, very wise. She had glo- 
rious red hair, braided and bound like a coronet. 
She looked at you out of beautiful, green eyes and 
talked in slow, monotonous tones, the result of much 
experience with the direct facts of life. Once Ruth 
had taken off her little red flannel petticoat and 
waved it in the faces of the Cossacks who had come 
to search the house for revolutionary literature. 
This little demonstration had hurried the family’s 
departure from Russia. Somehow she had grasped 
the idea of going straight to headquarters when 
she wanted anything. 
“T hope you won’t mind, but I want to ask your 
advice,” she announced one day. ‘‘It isn’t about 
school.” 
Ruth really never wanted advice. She always 
felt competent to give it so I waited in silence. 
“Well, you see, it’s this way. There are eight of 
us at home and father, he sits home and won't go to 
work only when he likes it and then he gives my 
mother only two dollars a week. That isn’t much 
for a room and meals, especially now. Well, I 
wouldn’t mind his not paying more money, if he
-P-A-G-E-80

would only leave my mother and the children alone. 
No, he sits there and complains and swears to my 
brothers and sisters. Such languages isn’t good for 
children to hear. He is getting worse and worse 
every day, and my mother cries and I can’t bear to 
see my mother cry. You don’t know how hard my 
mother works. 
“There is Abe. He is eight, but he is a little 
stupid and very weak and can’t eat regular food. 
And my big sister that goes to work in the fur 
shop downtown and gets home all tired out. You 
could hardly believe how hard she works. 
“* And my father makes all this trouble. He plays 
cards at night with his friends that came from the 
other side with him, the same country he came from. 
When the men come to play cards, we must stay up 
late, and that’s not good for us. I can’t stand it 
any longer.” 
Here Ruth stopped talking and looked at me ex- 
pectantly. 
Still I waited, merely lifting an inquiring eyebrow. 
“T took advice,” she resumed, “ and went before 
the judge and told him everything. Now had I 
right? The judge asked me if we wanted to put 
him out. I said no, he was my father, but I wanted 
the judge to make him stop using bad languages. 
The judge did, and told me to come to him in case 
there was any more trouble.”
-P-A-G-E-81
  
Outside the School 75 
“How has your father been since?” I asked her 
when I had sufficiently recovered. 
“Very well. He does not talk much, but he 
looks as if he wanted to. I don’t care; I know 
what’s good for him.” 
“Ts he to give you any more money?” 
“Yes, the judge said he must give half his salary 
at least and he must work, and be good, and be 
proud of his children.” 
I found a boy in a classroom after school hours. 
His shirt was full of flowers that other children had 
brought to the teacher. 
““What are going to do with them?” 
“Take them home -and hide them.” 
Why hide them? His mother would not let him 
take the flowers home. She did not want him to 
steal flowers. 
I went to see his father. He knew his boy took 
flowers not only from the teacher but from the florist 
and from the park. He would punish the boy as he 
had done many times before. I could see for my- 
self by examining the boy’s body. He would whip 
him more now than ever. 
“What can I do?” he went on. “TI go out to 
work all day. I have three children that go to school. 
I make a dollar and a half a day when it does not 
rain; I have to pay fourteen dollars a month rent. I

want my boy to learn. I give him plenty to eat 
though beans are ten cents a pound. I try to make 
_ him study and he goes out stealing flowers and dis- 
graces me.” 
““ A dollar and fifty cents a day, when it does not 
rain.” I saw the man’s torn shoes, his shabby 
clothes and knotted fingers. I saw the boy’s skinny 
body and his starving soul craving for the sweet earth 
flowers. Was it the children’s fault? 
“Please help me. Do something for me,” 
pleaded a sixteen year old girl just out of school. 
“My little brother makes such a fuss at home! 
When he does not like his food, he pulls the table 
cloth on the floor and breaks the dishes. When a 
young man comes to see me, my brother makes such 
trouble that he never comes back. Now I am get- 
ting along in years. I'll be seventeen next birthday. 
I am losing my chances. He threw the sofa pillows 
out of the window. I must take from my savings 
to buy more pillows and dishes. How can I save 
up for a husband?” 
“Please make my boy clean himself before he 
comes to school. He won’t do it for me.” 
“Please talk to Herbert about hitting his little 
brother. You have such influence over him.” 
“Put my boy away. He is no good. He steals

On one side of the school was the road, dusty, 
badly kept and constantly used. Across the street 
was the park, beautiful and fresh at first but as the 
population increased, abused and neglected more 
and more. 
On the other side ran the elevated trains that dis- 
turbed us all. Assembly exercises in the morning 
had to stop to let the trains go by. Classroom reci- 
tations had to stop too for there was no competi- 
tion. The children and the teachers got the habit 
of waiting in the middle of a sentence as the roar 
began, swelled,— ceased. 
The school district reached across the park to the 
east where lived many families who owned their own 
houses. These were the first residents, the lovers of 
grass and open spaces, of home and family tradi- 
tions. It extended westward four blocks to the 
tracks of the railroad and north and south almost a

quarter of a mile each way. A wide area this. 
Scattered about were empty lots, fences,— long 
stretches of fences, empty houses and flats. The 
neighbourhood was in a state of transition from a 
dignified provincial suburb to a mass of tenements. 
There was a group of people who came from the 
southern part of the city each spring that their chil- 
dren might enjoy the open spaces of the neighbour- 
hood. They remained until fall when they returned 
to their steam heated flats. This made an unstable 
community in the school and in the neighbourhood. 
Each time they came fewer of them returned and the 
tenements grew in number. 
This meant that most of our children came from 
little two, three and four room flats, strung along 
block upon block. In such homes there was little 
time or room for play, work or fun. As the crowds 
came the tenements increased and poured their ten- 
ants out upon the sidewalks and streets. The street 
corner, the curb, the candy shop, the pool room, the 
dance hall were becoming the social centres of the 
district. 
There was a mixture of races. These were peo- 
ple who had come from various countries of Eu- 
rope and they differed in their attitude towards 
ethics, society, religion, ‘education, cleanliness. 
These differences isolated the various groups, the 
families, and the blocks.  
-P-A-G-E-85
Outside the School 719 
These parents did not understand the newer con- 
ditions of life. They did not understand the city. 
They did not understand the school. They did not 
understand the older residents. 
In their turn they too were misunderstood even 
by their own children. The child saw in the rush 
of the school life the idea of getting on. In school 
he saw life in a white collar, fine clothes, and an easy 
job. Home was not like this. 
Michael was one of the brightest and most promis- 
. ing among the boys. He was a yard monitor. He 
came to school early and stayed late. He helped 
the teachers attend to supplies and hang pictures. 
Whatever the work in hand, Michael was first assist- 
ant. 
A neighbour brought Michael’s mother in to see 
me. She turned to her friend and spoke in a for- 
eign tongue and the neighbour answered, and turned 
to me saying,—‘‘ She speaks no English. I have 
come to talk to you for her.” 
“That’s too bad. I thought Michael was born 
in this city?” I said. 
“Oh, yes, they’ve been in this country fifteen 
years, but she never learned the language. She’s 
religious and doesn’t go around much.” 
Michael’s mother was anxiously watching our 
faces while we talked and now she spoke again to the 
neighbour.
-P-A-G-E-86
80 \A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
“She says to tell you that she wants to see 
Michael.” 
Michael was sent for and came into the office with 
his usual cheerful willingness. When he saw his 
mother he stopped. She went toward him. Mi- 
chael backed against the wall, his face sullen and em- 
barrassed. His mother talked pleadingly. She put 
her hand on his shoulder and he pushed it off rudely. 
Then his mother sank into“a chair and began to cry 
softly. 
Michael stood against the wall scowling down at 
his shoes. I looked on wondering what it could be 
about. The neighbour began to talk. 
“It’s a pity. It’s a shame. Mickee, you 
shouldn’t treat your mother that way.” 
“ She shouldn’t come here,’”’ muttered Michael. 
The neighbour looked from Michael to the weep- 
ing woman and anger shone in her face as she turned 
to me. 
“You think Michael is a good boy, don’t you? 
You like him. Well, I don’t. You think you do a 
lot for him by keeping him in school all day long 
and letting him run all over for the teachers. 
You're just spoiling him. You're only making him 
selfish. He thinks he’s too good to talk to his own 
mother. That’s what you’re doing if you want to 
know the truth.” 
Then turning to Michael she said, “If you be-
-P-A-G-E-87
Outside the School 81 
longed to me you wouldn’t act like that. I’d fix 
you.” ; 
Michael lifted his head ready to answer but catch- 
ing my eye resumed his sullen attitude again. 
“ You can go to your room now, Michael. Come 
in to see me after hours,” I said to his great re- 
lief. 
“Td wish,” the neighbour broke in, “ you would 
take a stick to that kid’s back. His mother can do 
nothing more with him. I’m sorry for her. She 
came from Russia years ago. She was quiet and 
stayed in the house. Michael is ashamed of her be- 
cause she can’t talk English. He makes fun of her 
clothes. When there is a school party he doesn’t 
even tell her. Her husband learned English and all 
the American ways quickly. So did the children. 
Now her husband is ashamed of her and he lives by 
himself. Michael goes to see him and lots of times 
he stays two or three days. His mother hasn’t seen 
him this week. That’s why she came here, to beg 
him to come home to her.” 
Here were children and parents living their lives 
apart. These children were ashamed because their 
parents did not speak or look like Americans. How 
could I help the children in my school respond to the 
dreams of their fathers? How could I get the 
fathers to share in the work of building a school for 
their children? 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  82 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
The parents often misunderstood the motives of 
the school in dealing with their children. Espe- 
cially was this true of the parents whose children 
were fitted for manual rather than for intellectual 
labour. 
When their fourteen year old boys and girls who | 
had almost reached their full physical growth and 
had difficulty in making the fifth grade were placed 
in a special class in which the emphasis was put on 
the fundamentals of learning because they would 
soon have to go out and work for a living, the par- 
ents came to protest. 
I did not blame them for protesting although my 
reason was different from theirs. Already these 
children had had too much of the fundamentals. 
Their mentalities had foundered on the sacred three 
R’s. In these average special classes instead of less 
of the three R’s, the children got more of them. It 
was like taking a drowning man out of a lake and 
throwing him into the sea. 
But the parents protested not because these chil- 
dren were being given more reading, writing and 
arithmetic, but because the special class meant that 
the child who was put there was an outcast from the 
normal school life. He would soon have to go to 
work because he had no brains for books. 
In the country they came from this question would 
not have arisen. The children would have gone to
-P-A-G-E-89
  
Outside the School 83 
the farm or the factory as their fathers for genera- 
tions had gone. But it was to avoid that future they 
had come to this new land and when we were obliged 
to say to some of them that their children would 
never be able to become doctors or lawyers or priests 
but they would and should become workingmen and 
women, they were bitter in their denunciation of the 
school. 
So it was in matters of health. Parents who had 
been brought up in the country where there was no 
noise, no confusion, no confinement, where the food 
came directly from the soil, were somewhat at a loss 
to appreciate why it was that their children so often 
were ill. 
They could not understand that the noise of the 
city life and the speed of city work, the effect of 
canned foodstuff and adulterated food products were 
factors in the lives of their children. They could 
not, therefore, understand why their children could 
not grow as they had. 
Having been in the habit of trusting nature, they 
declared when the school required medical attention, 
“The child will grow out of it. I never had such 
diseases and why should my child?” Even when 
they seemed convinced that medical attention was

organised with the idea of a maximum spiritual and 
intellectual growth. 
The home. alone could do nothing. It was iso- 
lated, antagonistic, indifferent. It shut its eyes fear- 
ing, distrusting, hoping for better things but doing 
nothing. The more it lived by itself the less able it 
became to hold the children close to itself. 
(I had learned that education was a matter of 
|“co-operation between parents and teachers. Con- 
\ duct, self-expression, meant action in the street and 
home. Moral education meant group reaction. 
The problems of my school, therefore, loomed up 
as the problems of our community. The transfers 
of our teachers and of our children, the equipment 
of the building, the curriculum, were not only school 
problems but community problems. Unless the peo- 
ple knew about.and shared in the education of their 
children the schools would be inefficient. To save 
the school and the home from becoming cloistered, 
self centred, the culture of children would have to 
be a co-operative effort between the people and the 
teachers.

“ How did you begin?” 
I don’t know exactly how I began. I began as so 
many others did without realising that I was begin- 
ning anything unusual. I began slowly, hesitatingly, 
making many mistakes as I went. 
“ How did you begin?” 
Does not that very question try to force a tabu- 
lated, logically arranged answer that may be ap- 
plied like a formula to any situation? Is it not more 
important to know why the school began, and how 
the work grew, and the value of what the school 
jlearned while it was growing? 
/ I explained to the teachers that we needed the 
parents. How we were going to get them was an- 
other matter. I have a feeling that we started by 
noting the men and women who seemed to take some 
interest in the school life of their children. I dis- 
tinctly remember that we studied the various neigh- 
bourhood groups to discover who the leaders were, 85 é  
-P-A-G-E-92
  86 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
that we singled out those who objected most to what 
the children were doing in their street time. Slowly, 
/ almost unconsciously, the neighbourhood people 
\ came in touch with the school and with each other. 
\ Our primary task was to hear the people talk.” 
The more they talked the sooner we were able to see 
\.what they were like and what they had to give to 
the school. We were good listeners and when we 
saw that a neighbour’s vital interests touched some 
phase of common social growth, we knew that neigh- 
bour had something to give that the school needed. 
Early one morning, before opening exercises, a 
gentleman came in and said he must see me at once. 
He was greatly excited and paced up and down the 
office as he talked. 
“Two of my boys come to this school so I think 
you ought to be interested in what concerns their 
welfare and whatever goes on in the neighbourhood 
concerns them mightily.” 
Here was a man with a point of view. I listened 
intently. 
“Yesterday one of them might have been killed 
by one of your pupils. The milkman leaves his 
cases of empty bottles in the vacant lot opposite my 
house. Yesterday afternoon a gang of boys fought 
the children on the block with those bottles. They 
threw them at each other’s heads, sir. I tell you it’s 
outrageous. My boys were coming home peaceably . 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
The Parents at Work 87 
when some of those ruffians attacked them with 
empty bottles — glass bottles. It’s murderous, I 
tell you. Fun’s fun but this is no fun.” And he 
brought his clenched fist down smartly on his out- 
stretched palm. ‘ What’s the school doing? Can 
you offer us parents no better protection for our chil- 
dren than this?” 
Drawing himself to his full height and speaking 
more earnestly if possible he rallied me to a sense 
of my duty. ‘‘ The public school is or ought to-be \ 
the greatest force for good in the community. If 
it’s going to stand by and see these children of for- 
eigners actually murder our children — the children 
of generations of Americans who gave their lives for 
their flag and their country —then this nation is 
lost, sir. As a parent and a citizen I call upon you 
to do your duty. Search out the miscreants and 
mete out fit punishment for them. Skinning’s too 
good for them.” 
Advancing to the desk shelf that separated us he 
punctuated his rapid phrases with sharp taps of his 
fingers. ‘“‘ When I went to school they used to teach 
the children respect for law and order and above 
all a regard for truth. But the schools these. days 
have no time to teach law and order. They have no 
time to teach the simple adherence to the truth.” 
“ But,” I suggested, before he could begin again, 
“perhaps some of this misbehaviour which as you 
   
-P-A-G-E-94
88 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
state occurs outside the school is due to the lack of 
care and influence of the home folk?” 
“Maybe, maybe, a little of it. But work isn’t 
done by shifting the responsibility, you know. I’ve 
pointed out the disease. The remedy is up to you.” 
“Tl investigate this,’ I said. “I'll report my 
findings to you if you wish.” 
“Indeed I wish. I'll come back again in a day or 
so. I believe in the personal touch, sir,” and with a 
grim ‘“‘ Good day, sir,” he marched out. 
I called in one of the older teachers in the school 
and told her the story and asked her to search the 
thing carefully. I wanted to make a thorough re- 
port to the man. 
“We ought to get his energy and interest in the 
school if we can manage it,” I added. 
True to his word he came back a few days later. 
“ Well, sir, what have you? Not forgotten all 
about it I hope?” 
“No,” I said, “I’ve not forgotten. I find that 
the boys concerned in the bottle fight were two groups 
of our boys who were dismissed after the main body 
of the school had gone home for the day and no 
teachers and monitors were on duty.” 
“Just what I said, nobody on the job, sir.” 
“And,” I went on without heeding the interrup- 
tion, ‘‘ both groups of boys threw the bottles at each 
other without any thought of hurting any one. 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  
The Parents at Work 89 
They had no quarrel. It was just the reaction after 
the repression of the day, a very dangerous one, to be 
sure, but boys are heedless and thoughtless.” 
“ Heedless and thoughtless — I should —” 
“ Another thing,” I insisted, interrupting him, ‘I 
found that a few of these boys had taken milk from 
the neighbours’ bottles to feed some stray cats they 
were keeping as pets in the vacant lot across the 
street from your home.” 
“ Awful! Murderous weapons to beat the brains 
out of one another and then thievery! Just what I 
told you, sir. Now —” 
I could restrain him no longer, and once more he 
pointed a solemn finger at me. “I demand of you, 
young man, that for the good of the children we par- 
ents have entrusted to your care, you search out these 
offenders and punish them, that you make every 
reasonable effort to see that the streets are safe 
places for the children of the neighbourhood. My 
advice is to look for the leaders and the rest will be 
easy.” 
“T have one or two of them,”-I said. 
“Good,” he answered with a note of surprise. 
“One of them is Henry.” 
“Henry? Henry who?” 
“ Why — your Henry.” 
“Myson? Never, sir — you’re joking, I’m seri- 
ous in this. My son?”   
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  90 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
“Well, suppose you ask him. He told me him- 
self, and he keeps a couple of the cats.”’ 
Varying emotions chased themselves swiftly across 
the fine old face. Then a grin stole over it — 
“Well, well, sir. I’m astonished: and Henry 
told you?” 
“Yes — you see, there’s very little a boy can do 
after school but get into mischief. In your day it 
was different. There were many things to keep you 
| busy. Perhaps now, you could help us get some 
\ after-school activities for the children. Working 
together we could do something.” 
“T’ll help you in any way I can, sir. This neigh- 
bourhood must be a decent place for our children. 
Just show me how I can be of service and I'll be de- 
lighted to assist you.” Then a vestige of the old 
grin appeared as he rose to go. “I believe in the 
personal touch, sir, the personal touch. I'll attend 
to Henry.” 
“This is one parent I can count on,” I said as he 
walked out. 
When the children needed a garden the teachers 
went to the real estate operator on the corner. He 
was interested at once and loaned us a nearby lot and 
allowed us a room in his office suite to store our 
tools. 
He was one of the leaders whom we had made up
-P-A-G-E-97
  The Parents at/Work gt 
our minds we should have. /He was the kind to 
help make the school’s needs the people’s opportuni- 
ties. 
Fancy the busiest real estate man in our district 
allowing a troup of grubby young ones to prance in 
and out of his office daily for months, armed with 
rakes, hoes, spades, shovels, trowels, to say nothing 
of the sheet iron wheel-barrow that brought up the 
clattering rear. 
This he did and smiled. 
One day he was seated in conference with some 
dignified city officials whom he was trying to per- 
suade to some civic betterment plan he had taken to 
his heart. The gardeners, hushed by the anxious 
teacher, pigeon-toed into the outer room. With un- 
"usual quiet, tools were stacked in the corner. Isaac 
and his beloved barrow came last. The children 
held their breath while he skilfully reversed his pet 
and leaned it against the wall. Alas — alack — 
the relieved teacher was taking the hushing finger 
from her lips and turning towards the door when 
that barrow slipped, slid, and the whole armoury, 
each bit, screeching its own note of protest, crashed 
to the floor. 
“Bless my-dife,” called the most dignified city 
official starting out of his chair. 
Calm as a summer day our friend merely turned 
his head and said, ‘‘ Those kids certainly have the
-P-A-G-E-98
  92 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
time of their little lives on that bit of land. I tell 
you, gentlemen, there’s nothing like it. Back to the 
land! The land is the source of all wealth —“ All 
right, children,” as they essayed to restore order out 
of the heap of hardware. “It’s allright. Harry’ll 
fix all that. The tools need cleaning up anyway.” 
The streets and park in front of the school were 
bare of trees and we thought Arbour Day would be 
d@ fine time to plant some. 
Accordingly a committee of teachers wrote the 
Park Commissioner asking for trees for Arbour 
Day. He wrote a very non-committal note, the gist 
of which was that he didn’t understand what children 
were going to do with valuable trees. 
We were all discussing the note and wondering 
what next to do when the teacher came in from her 
gardening class. 
“T think we have the trees. I met Robert Hull 
on my way in. He’s one of the Administration law- 
yers now, you know. I used to teach him. He 
wanted to know what I was doing with the ‘kids 
and the spades’ and I told him and mentioned our 
difficulty about the trees. 
“© That’s because you teachers are a lot of ama- 
teurs,’ he said. ‘You don’t know how; the Park 
Commissioner doesn’t know you from a hole in the 
ground; you don’t cut any political ice and he doesn’t
-P-A-G-E-99
  The Parents at Work 93 
know the kids’ side of it. I’ll go and explain to him 
and I have a hunch you'll get those trees.’ ” 
We got them too — twelve beauties. 
Each year after this a dozen trees were given the 
school by the park department. After the first year 
the trees were given, not because of individual re- 
quests, but because of the new relation established 
between the public school and the Department of 
Parks. 
As the months passed people became as inter- 
esting to us as children. All sorts of folks with all 
sorts of stories came to school. The more we 
looked the more we found those that were most use- 
ful to us. 
A motherly looking woman was shown in one day 
and stood looking at me as if doubtful whether she 
should come in or go out. 
“Can I do anything for you?” 
“ Are you the principal? ” 
“Yes, can I help you?” 
“T don’t know, that’s just why I came. I’ve been 
everywhere and don’t know where else to go. I’m 
bothered my life out with a child. Not mine. If 
she was mine, I’d kill her.” 
“ Does she come to this school? ” 
“Not a bit of it. She goes to no school and she’s 
close on to twelve.”  
-P-A-G-E-100
a ae 
94 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
“Why doesn’t she go to school?” 
“No school would have her, I’m thinking, and 
small blame to them. She’s one bad habit. She’s 
| a ‘runner.’” 
“ A runner?” 
“Yes, she’s always going somewhere and never 
content when she gets there till she gets somewhere 
else, d’ye understand?”’ And she dabbed her per- 
spiring face with a wadded handkerchief. Explana- 
tions were hard work. 
“Well, she keeps our whole block on edge. We 
never know what’s to do next. But this last is the 
limit. Tuesday she walked into my area where my 
baby was sleeping in its carriage and lifted it and 
away with it down the block. She got tired of carry- 
ing it— he’s a heavy child, and doesn’t she go into 
another woman’s basement and take her baby car- 
riage out and away she pelts. 
“To make a long story short, after we had called 
up the police and the hospitals, she came walking up 
to me. 
“* Are you looking for the baby?’ she asks, meek 
as a lamb. 
“*Tam. Where is he?’ 
“*T left him down the street in Conlon’s base- 
ment,’ says she. 
“There he was right enough. We went to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  
The Parents at Work 95 
police lieutenant and says he, ‘ You got the baby all 
right?’ 
“* * Surely.’ 
“© And you got the carriage?’ 
“To be sure.’ 
“© Well, spank the kid and close the case,’ said he, 
and thought it a good joke. Can you do some- 
thing?” 
I asked her to bring the mother of the little girl to 
seeme. They came very soon. The mother of the 
sinner was sweet faced and sad. 
“T’m sorry Kate is so troublesome,” she said. 
“She is very hard to control. I cannot keep her in 
school. She runs out every chance she gets and she 
is so trying the teacher is glad to have her go. - I 
have a crippled husband and I cannot leave him long 
at a time so Kate is getting little or no training and 
she needs it.” 
The accusing mother listened intently. 
“Hark you,” said she as if inspired by a new 
idea. “If I bring her here myself every day will 
you try to keep her?” 
“T’ll do my best,” I answered. 
“ Then I'll do it,” she said firmly. 
Faithfully she kept her word. She escorted her 
charge to and from school regularly for almost a 
year. Then the child came without her.
-P-A-G-E-102
96 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
But the self-appointed truant officer had got a per- 
sonal interest in the school and the children that she 
never lost. 
We were getting hold. 
These were the old residents. If we could get 
them interested and active then they might not all go 
away. Some might stay with us and help interest 
the new comers, holding them to the neighbourhood 
and the school. 
After some time there was a group of neighbours 
who through personal service had a genuine interest 
in the school life. They talked about the school to 
their friends, they talked about the school to their 
children. Their children talked about the school to 
them. Many times the children were the means of 
bringing parents and teachers together. 
“Mother, please come and see my teacher,” said 
one of our youngest children. The mother came 
leading the child to the teacher’s classroom. 
“ Mother,” the child whispered, “ isn’t she lovely ? 
She is so pretty. She has lovely blue eyes and she 
smiles all the time.” 
Some of the parents invited the teachers to their 
homes and the teachers went. The teachers invited 
the parents to school and some of the parents came. 
Now and then the teacher was asked to the pupil’s 
birthday party, to mother’s anniversary, or to a feast 
day celebration. f
-P-A-G-E-103
The Parents at Work 97 
In and out the web was woven. Here and there 
children, teachers and parents became more inti- 
mate, more friendly. The school world that had 
been sufficient within itself opened up its doors; a 
little at first, but as the days passed more and more. 
I 
We saw that the way to reach people and keep 
' their co-operation was to give them work. Having 
secured individual co-operation we began to work for 
group co-operation. We wanted the parents to come 
into the school as a collective force. 
What was the best way to get at it? We held 
many teachers’ meetings,— formal and informal, try- 
ing to devise a scheme that would bring the great 
mass of parents in touch with the school. 
We had been struggling to do this for a long time 
and had succeeded only in getting the parent who 
was already interested in school and school matters 
to work with us. The parent who needed us most 
and whose interest we most desired to arouse was 
still a stranger to us. 
We decided on a course of meetings. We would 
do what the other schools were doing at their par- 
ents’ meetings. We would have concerts; the ap- 
peal of music was universal. We would have popu- 
lar lectures by specialists. We set to work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  98 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
The concert was the first thing attempted. We 
secured the use of the building, and the services of 
fine musicians. The little group of parents already 
our helpers promised to come early and take charge 
of the programme. 
The evening of the concert came. The doors 
were opened. Henry’s father presided. The 
teachers scattered through the rooms ready to greet 
the parents and make them feel at home. 
At eight o’clock fifteen parents who had been in 
the school many times before, were assembled in the 
big room that held five hundred. At eight fifteen, 
twenty-seven people were present. Another dozen 
strolled in by eight-thirty when the concert began. 
That night we held a conference at the school 
door. What was wrong? We had done every- 
thing we could think of to make the evening a great 
success and this was the result. There were no ex- 
planations, no excuses. We had failed. We went 
home pondering on the perversity of human nature. 
We tried again. This time we had a lecture on 
“Pure Food,” a subject that was being widely dis- 
cussed throughout the city. Again we made our 
elaborate preparations and advertised the lecture 
well in advance. Nobody came but our own little 
group. 
“T’m almost afraid to suggest what I have in mind 
because it is contrary to what we have been teaching,
-P-A-G-E-105
/ The Parents at Work 99 
but ‘ desperate diseases,’ you know,” said one of our 
primary teachers. ‘‘I think the only way you can 
get the average father and mother to school is to 
invite them to see their own children perform. The 
parents are in the school only because their own chil- 
dren are here. Let’s have the next meeting an en- 
tertainment given by the children. I think the folks 
will come then.” 
“But it will keep the children up late.” 
“T’ve thought of that. We'll keep the actors in 
classrooms. Immediately after they perform the 
teacher in charge can take them out of the building 
and send them home. We'll let the younger chil- 
dren get through first.” 
The teacher had the idea. The parents were in- 
terested in their own children first. That was the 
place to begin. 
The school naturally divided into grade groups ac- 
cording to the age and the needs of the pupils. 
There were the kindergarten and the first year chil- 
dren. There was the primary group and there was 
the upper grade group. 
The teachers in each of these groups held parents’ 
meetings after school hours. The parents came to 
the classrooms and saw the children and the teacher 
at work for the last school hours of the day, and 
then when the children were dismissed the parents 
met the teachers in conference, Then the discussion 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
c 100 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
was specific. Whether the problem was getting 2 
lesson or cleaning teeth or the need of fresh air, it 
was directly applied to the children. 
We began also to colour our evening meetings 
with the performances of the children whose par- 
ents seemed further away from us. The parents 
began to come. When they came once they were 
apt to come again. 
All this time, however, the teachers were doing the 
work. But we were gathering the forces, preparing 
the way for effective organisation. 
Having done these things it was again decided to 
hold a large meeting. We were going to try once 
more to get the mass feeling in sympathy with the 
school. 
This meeting opened with an entertainment — a 
play in two acts, given by the children. The school 
orchestra furnished the music. At the end of 
the first act I spoke to the people who filled the 
hall. 
“My friends,” I said, “I have brought you here 
to enlist your collective help in the work of the 
school. Acting together as a moral force in the 
neighbourhood you are more vital to the education 
* of the children than is the school. 
“You remember the story of the cactus plant, how 
once upon a time, the cactus'was a fine flourishing 
plant with luscious fruit. Then there came a change
-P-A-G-E-107
  The Parents at Work 101 
over that part of the earth where the cactus grew. 
The mountains heaved and the wind shifted. 
“The valley that was once rich became barren 
and the plants died. They all died but the cactus 
plant, which, in answer to the new needs that the 
changing earth brought, toughened its skin and grew 
needles all over its body. 
“The winds came with their sandy blasts and the 
cactus plant withstood their attacks. It had be- 
come ugly, repellent, and the beasts of the field 
could not touch it. 
“Thousands of years after, a man came by who 
took the cactus plant and put it in his garden. 
“Here there were no hot sandy winds. There 
was moisture and soft breezes and wonderful soil 
to grow in. The cactus plant changed and became 
once more the thing it had been in the beginning, a 
fine plant with luscious fruit. 
“So it is with your children. You are the soil 
nd the wind and the light in which the child, your 
plant, grows. ¥ You are the environment, the com- 
pelling force which by its influence, can make the chil- 
dren fine children, or can make of them warped and 
twisted natures unfit to live with, unworthy to carry 
on the ideals of your souls. 
“Even if we could take upon our shoulders all the 
responsibilities of the home and relieve you entirely 
it would not be good for you and for the children. 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  102 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
The children need you. You cannot afford to have 
the teachers take over your responsibility. 
“You must share the common burden. You must 
work all together to make the conditions of life 
under which the children are living such that they 
will grow up healthy, intelligent, sympathetic, ap- 
preciative of the ideals of school, appreciative of the 
ideals of family life, and of fine American citizen- 
ship.” 
More meetings followed this one. Like the 
others these meetings were managed by the teachers 
mainly. As long as the meetings remained in the 
teachers’ hands they belonged to the teachers; they 
were large classes for parents where the teachers 
played the main part, and the parents give largely 
a listening co-operation. What the parents needed 
was an incentive. Their coming together enabled 
them to talk to each other about school problems. 
Before we knew it group opinion began to centre 
about children’s needs, equipment, children’s work, 
school continuity, moral training. 
At first a few, had come protesting about the shift- 
ing of children. They had come as individuals. 
Then more of the old residents of the district dis- 
turbed by the conditions of things in the school and 
in the neighbourhood, came in twos and threes and 
made their objections. They felt that the fine old 
school from which they had been graduated had been
-P-A-G-E-109
  The Parents at Work 103 
offered an affront — had lost its standing and pres- 
tige, and that they must have this adjusted. 
This they told me as I met them in and about the 
school and I appreciated their point of view which 
harmonised with my own in that I felt the loss of the 
older children to be a serious handicap to the younger 
ones. 
Among them was a young lawyer whose father as 
well as himself had been graduated from the school. 
“T think it was a mistake,”’ said he; ‘I think the 
local board didn’t realise the meaning of their action. 
I know them all pretty well. The secretary is a per- 
sonal friend of mine. In fact I asked for his ap- 
pointment. I'll go over with a few of the folks and 
talk it over with them.” 
I saw him again a few days later. He was burst- 
ing with wrath and indignation. 
“Think of it,” he stormed; “ think of it! We 
went over and there they all sat about the big table. 
I started to talk and the gentleman at the head of 
the table held up his hand and said, ‘ Have you an 
appointment here to-night?’ 
“* No,’ I said, ‘I haven't, I just came in to speak 
a.) you about our top grades.’ 
‘** Exactly. Won’t you have the secretary of your 
organisation write to our secretary "— Billie, mind 
you —‘and ask for an appointment and we will be 
pleased to hear you when we can reach you on the

-P-A-G-E-110
    104 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
calendar.’ And there sat Billie and never opened 
his mouth.” 
“‘ What did you do?” 
“What could we do? They asked us whom we 
represented — they intimated we’d better go and 
get a reputation before we came before them 
again— And we're going to get it. We're going 
to organise an Association and go back. That’s 
what.” : 
The school had already furnished the impetus. 
The few leaders confident of their strength and sure 
of their position with relation to the school called a 
meeting. They tried to get the schoolhouse but they 
were too impatient to wait until permission was 
granted. The real estate man offered them his 
corner store as freely as he had offered it to the 
grubby gardeners. The people came not on tiptoes 
but talking, gesticulating, protesting. And this was 
the beginning of the parents’ organisation. 
Ii 
The parents wanted frequent meetings. They 
were impatient to get to work to see things done. 
But the school law provided that only four meetings 
a year could be granted. 
There is that in each one of us that makes us an- 
tagonistic to a new idea — to a new point of view.
-P-A-G-E-111
The Parents at Work “105 
We have been happily pursuing our course and some 
one comes along and suggests that perhaps it has not 
been the best one in the world and maybe his is 
better. 
Our first impulse is to brush him aside — bowl him 
over — get him out of the way, anything so we may 
be comfortable again. 
But that won’t do. Society won’t permit it. We 
must listen more or less patiently while he dins his 
story into our ears. We argue the matter with him, 
we protest loudly, vigorously, with much waving of 
arms and stamping of feet. 
We end by acknowledging he has much right on 
his side and if he had only said that long ago we 
should have understood him at once and saved much 
valuable time. 
When the parents therefore asked for frequent 
use of the building the School Authorities objected. 
“No, no,” they said. “It isn’t done. ’Twould 
be a bad precedent.” 
The association urged and persisted. 
“Yes, we know, you’re respectable, responsible 
citizens but you’re going to open the building to the 
public. They'll mar the furniture and damage the 
building. You must remember the school was built 
for the children. We must protect their interests.” 
“ But we are the parents of the children —” came 
the reminder. 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  106 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
“Yes, yes, we believe you to be perfectly fine peo- 
ple, but you’d better hire a hall. You might say 
things we would not like to stand for. We'll let you 
have the building four nights a year. That’s very 
generous. We hope you won’t abuse the privilege.” 
The Association was not satisfied with this con- 
cession. However, they accepted these four meet- 
ings and when they wanted more,— and they did,— 
they went to the Real Estate store or to the candy 
shop around the corner. 
Then they decided that what the school needed 
was direct representation in the Local School Board. 
No member of the Local School Board had a child 
attending our school! Small wonder they did not 
understand the parents’ requests. 
Neighbourhood opinion supported the idea and 
soon the chairman of the Executive Committee was . 
appointed on the Local School Board. That was a 
great step forward, a strong link between the school 
workers and the administration group. 
The parents were granted the use of the building 
once a month during the school year simply because 
some one who knew was on hand to explain the 
need. 
They looked forward to the monthly meetings 
when matters of vital interest to themselves and their 
children were discussed. 
These points were always carefully selected by  
-P-A-G-E-113
The Parents at Work 107 
the Executive Committee months ahead. The 
speakers were secured and the details of the pro- 
gramme well worked up so that the meeting pro- 
ceeded with the precision and efficiency of fine organi- 
sation. 
The usual “ order of business ” was followed: the 
various committees made their reports which were 
accepted or returned for further work as the cases 
demanded. New committees for new work were ap- 
pointed and then the audience settled back to hear 
the special topic of the evening. 
The Executive Committee, not the teachers, 
planned a health meeting. It was one of the neigh- 
bours who gave the talk. 
This doctor began by telling us that the public 
school with its thousands of children coming from 
all sorts of homes was apt to be a breeding place for 
all sorts of contagious and infectious diseases. 
In simple language the doctor told the parents 
how to protect their children from the contagious or 
infectious diseases, how to recognise the first symp- 
toms of them. His points were illustrated with 
slides, the best of their kind. 
“ Only by utmost care and vigilance,” were his last 
words “‘ exercised by the school people, the Board of 
Health, doctors and nurses — and above all and be- 
yond all — by the parents, can the health, the lives 
even, of the children be safeguarded.”
-P-A-G-E-114
  108 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
The idea of the meetings was always a direct ap- 
plication of general principles to the immediate prob- 
lems. If we talked about art it was the children’s 
art with the children’s drawings before us. If we 
talked about play it was our children’s playground, 
our streets that were used. We made no attempt 
to bring in outsiders for general talks. Our work 
was specific and always had for its outcome some- 
thing to do, a job, a concrete thing. So much be- 
gins and ends in talk. We wanted to get things 
done. 
Naturally one expression of the group feeling was 
its relief work. The parents wanted to help the 
children, the neglected children, to attend and to 
profit by their school. 
A standing committee was formed. Its work was 
to investigate cases of parental neglect, cases of need, 
cases of truancy. These were simple and direct. 
They could be attended to without much room for 
argument. There was usually sufficient information 
at hand to insure promptness in relief work. 
Red haired Pat, small and ill-kept, did not attend 
school. The notices sent home by the teacher were 
unanswered. If a teacher called there was no one 
at home. 
The case of Pat in the hands of the parents be- 
came a simple matter.. The neighbours knew that 
the father drank and was seldom home. He had  
-P-A-G-E-115
  
The Parents at Work 109 
no job. The mother went out to work but could 
not make enough for food and clothing. Pat needed 
clothes. He needed food. He needed medical 
care. Pat was clothed, fed, had his teeth fixed. He 
was kept at school and that was the end of the mat- 
ter. 
There were other children like Pat in the school, 
who, for want of proper food were unable to go 
on with their work; there were children who be- 
cause they lacked proper clothing could not attend 
school; there were children who because proper 
medical care could not be given them were handi- 
capped in their progress. 
Physical needs were not new to the people. The 
ways of meeting these needs were not new to them. 
What was new was the group meeting these needs 
because it was their business to help their neighbours. 
What was new. was the conscious strength that came 
through united effort, the feeling of responsibility 
that made them answer, “ Yes, I am my brother’s 
keeper, because he is my brother.” 
“Help me,” was as natural a demand as its an- 
swer, ‘I will.” 
The judgment of the group was one that could 
generally be trusted. They loaned money to a fam- 
ily where the father was sick. The landlord was 
about to dispossess the family, the store keepers re- 
fused further credit. The relief committee loaned
-P-A-G-E-116
ea SE Te rer Te Taegan ee ee a eae 
110 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
them money, the family returning it in small instal- 
ments when times were better. 
One of the members of the committee was a 
clever, grey haired, Yankee lawyer. He was very 
much averse to anything that looked like charity and 
he had been placed on the committee to act as a 
brake on their generosity. 
“Have you inquired carefully into this case?” 
he would ask, balancing his eyeglasses on the end 
of his sharp forefinger. ‘‘ Are you sure? So many 
cases in a week looks queer to me. Before acting 
on them I’d like to ask for further investigation.” 
“ Further investigation! That’s the Charity Bu- 
reau’s cry and while they investigate the family 
starves to death. No, sir, I say no. Relieve first 
and investigate last,” this from Henry’s father, who 
was now leader of the group. 
“Very well, but you'll get stung. Mark my 
words. You'll get stung!” 
One family made repeated calls for help. Gro- 
ceries, shoes, medicine, rent, until even the leader 
was a bit worried and made a more thorough inves- 
tigation. 
When the final report was presented to the com- 
mittee it revealed that many parents had at some 
time or other, without the knowledge of the others, 
contributed money or food or clothes to these peo- 
ple: that two large charitable organisations in the    
-P-A-G-E-117
  
The Parents at Work E11 
city were contributing to the support of the fam- 
ily in mutual ignorance of the situation, and the 
crushing fact that the impostors owned valuable 
property. " 
For an instant there was tense silence and then 
the old lawyer jumped up — and pointing his fore- 
fingers at the leader shouted triumphantly — 
“Stung, by George. Stung! Didn’t I tell you! 
Didn’t I tell you! Stung!” 
Everybody rocked with laughter, but an investi- 
gator was added to the committee’s staff, forthwith. 
To make this sort of people better understand 
what the committee was trying to do it issued the 
following announcement: ‘“ Charity is not the pri- 
mary object of the association. We are not here 
to make parents careless and dependent. Our ob- 
ject is to help children and this we try to do, though 
in helping them we bring pressure to bear upon the 
parents to help their own.” 
Truancy and relief were intimately related. 
When a case of chronic absence was given to the 
attendance officer and he reported “ poverty,” the 
committee’s assistance in supplying clothing was 
often sufficient to cure truancy. Sometimes “ jobs ” 
had to be found for the working members of the 
family. This was done repeatedly. 
Other cases of truancy were not so simple. It 
   
-P-A-G-E-118
    
poe. 112 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
was no easy task to get the corner boot black, big, 
ponderous, fat, to come puffing into the school build- 
ing, with a struggling, kicking, yelling youngster, 
“a regular truant” he had found on the street, 
secure in his arms. 
Neither was it easy to get the janitress a block 
away to send her children. Only the persistent daily 
visits of a member of the committee, the one who 
brought in the “ runner,” could succeed here. The 
attendance officer, stunned by the number and va- 
riety of excuses, could make no headway, but this 
woman, convinced that the children must attend 
school, paid daily visits to this family. 
Some days she did not go but called at the school 
or sent a messenger. In case her particular charges 
were not in attendance she immediately started out, 
got the children and brought them to school. In 
the face of such persistence there was only one way 
out, the children had to come. 
The object of the association was, as specifically 
stated, to co-operate with the school authorities, to 
come individually and collectively into contact with 
the school so that the highest influence of heredity 
and environment could be brought to bear upon the 
education of the children — in short, to direct the 
group consciousness upon the welfare of the chil- 
dren. ;
-P-A-G-E-119
  
The Parents at Work 113 
Soon there were requests for information as to 
the work of the association. The president of the 
association, our garden man, felt that here was a 
new idea. 
“T sent out three hundred copies of this morn- 
ing’s paper. There was a fine account of our work. 
Have you seen it? My clerk was busy all day, cut- 
ting, folding, mailing. 
“This is getting to be a big thing,” he went on. 
“A parents’ Association in every school! That’s 
a big idea. I have been thinking of it for some 
time. What do you think of making a statement of 
policies?” 
“Splendid,” I answered, encouraging his enthu- 
siasm. 
“ A square deal for the children,’ he announced 
vehemently, ‘‘ means more parents’ associations, a 
federation of parents’ associations, co-operation be- 
tween teachers and parents, the best teachers for the 
elementary school and for the youngest children, 
the masses, more schools, and smaller classes.” 
I smiled as I recognised some of my own pet the- 
ories. 
The president appointed a committee to answer 
questions and to lend every assistance in their power 
to parents who desired to form a like association in 
their school. 
We are all preachers by nature. We get an idea
-P-A-G-E-120
  114 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
and at once believe it is the most important idea in 
the world. Then like true reformers we launch into 
the campaign. 
The danger of an adult association, however, lies 
\ not in this pushing enthusiasm of its members. The 
real danger comes when the association grows into 
a static, fixed, unyielding thing, itself a system. Par- 
ents’ Associations in the city are not apt to be static. 
They are more apt to be fluid. They are with you 
one year and away the next. There is always a 
group coming in and a group going out. They are 
always making mistakes, the natural mistakes of be- 
ginners. Their work is a constant challenge to the 
intelligence and patience of the school. Dealing 
with parents in the interest of children has always 
seemed to me like handling a dynamic factor, one 
that puts power and soul into the hands of the 
teacher because it puts power and soul into the peo- 
ple. Socialising the school means humanising the 
teacher.

No matter how many people moved into the 
neighbourhood, no matter how many tenements there 
were or how full, there was always the park. When 
the school was overwhelmed with children we looked 
out on the park and said, “ There is plenty of air
-P-A-G-E-121
The Parents at Work 115 
and sunshine, there are plenty of trees, and shade 
and grass.” When the streets overflowed there was 
the park to receive the overflow. When the sum- 
mer nights were unbearable there was the park to 
sleep in. It was always there smiling in the sun- 
shine — inviting the weary crowd to come out and 
rest. 
But behold, one morning a startled parent “came 
into school saying, ‘‘ What do you think is afoot? 
They want to erect an armoury in the park and use 
it as a drill ground. This must not be allowed. 
We need the park for ourselves and we don’t want 
amateur soldiers about. I shall ask that a meeting 
of the executive committee of the Parents’ Associa- 
tion be called at once.” 
Two nights later the executive committee met at 
the president’s house. The fact was brought out 
that a bill setting aside a portion of the park for 
an_armoury had been introduced in the legislature 
and passed. ‘Time was precious. The civic com- 
mittee was appointed with full power to act. A 
meeting of the whole association followed. Then 
came a campaign, petitions, protests. The commit- 
tee appeared before the Mayor when the bill was 
presented for his approval and joining forces with 
other park lovers secured its veto. 
Aside from saving the park as a playground for 
the children, the group realised that their united
-P-A-G-E-122
  116 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
strength could achieve results even in the face of 
powerful political interests. 
Two years later there was a second attempt at 
invasion. One morning a park attendant told a 
neighbour who was strolling by that he had seen a 
surveyor about and that a surveyor about meant a 
building. The neighbour was a member of the Ex- 
ecutive Committee of the Parents’ Association. At 
once there was a call, the school committee began 
to investigate. A startling discovery was made. 
Plans had been drawn for a firehouse to be erected 
in the park, the money appropriated and ground was 
about to be broken. ‘There remained but one small 
formality — the location of the building on the part 
of the park commissioner. This time the associa- 
tion was ready. ‘This time there was a united neigh- 
bourhood to appeal to and a People’s Neighbour- 
hood House through which to conduct a cam- 
paign. ; 
There were public meetings in halls hired for the 
purpose. There were continued meetings at the 
school, the settlement house, the neighbourhood dis- 
pensary. 
Then the parents’ association called into play — 
and it was to them —a group of young men, none 
of whom was more than twenty. These young men 
belonged to the school group. They were getting 
ready to take part in the group activity of the adults.  
-P-A-G-E-123
The Parents at Work 117 
Here was their opportunity. They helped at the 
open meetings. They circulated petitions. They 
organised groups of younger boys who paraded 
through the streets singing, “The parks must be 
free, the parks must be free for the people.” 
Sam, their leader, short, chunky, aggressive and 
deadly in earnest, wrote an impassioned letter to 
the Mayor protesting against the threatened inva- 
sion and calling the City Fathers to strict account 
for it. He read the letter to the club who enthu- 
siastically approved it and ordered it mailed forth- 
with. 
Eagerly Sam watched the mails for the reply and 
when the envelope bearing the City Hall Crest came 
he tore it open fully expecting a thrilling response 
from the famous letter writer. He got it. 
Across the top of Sam’s own letter in the Mayor’s 
neat chirography was pencilled, ‘‘ Who but a mad- 
man heeds what a madman says? ” W.J.G. 
The shout of laughter that went up was full of 
joyful appreciation of the old gentleman’s cleverness 
and the joke on Sam. 
After many months the city authorities, the park 
commissioner and the neighbourhood agreed upon 
a compromise. ‘The firehouse was put elsewhere. 
Once more, aside from saving the park, the group 
realised that united strength could achieve results 
even in the face of powerful opposition.

“ Tony did it,” gasped an enraged voice. I looked 
up. Framed in the office door stood Mrs. Mason 
in a sorry state. Tony, in one of his tantrums had 
vented his resentment in a more forceful way than 
usual. Calling names, throwing stones would not do: 
Tony had utilised the ammunition furnished by the 
pickle barrel,— the pickled onion, the scaly, salty 
fish. 
Mrs. Mason appeared reeking from the fray. 
Onion peels, fish scales, coated her usually immacu- 
late gown and the odour of dill was strong upon 
her. 
“Tony did it. I want you to punish Tony. He 
isa little terror. We are all in dread of him. Just 
now he charged into my shop, pointed a penny pis- 
tol in my face and shouted at me, ‘ Money or your 
life!’ 
“When I started after him he grabbed two hand- 
fuls of candy, knocked over the paper stand so I 
nearly fell over it and made out of the door. 
“JT chased him and he raced into Rachel’s fish 
store and this is what he did to me. 
“Tf I get him I’ll spank the life out of him. His 
parents don’t care. He gets most of his ideas from 
the movies. Something ought to be done. Teach
-P-A-G-E-125

these boys manners. Now-a-days children have no 
respect for older people.” 
Mrs. Mason sank into a chair and suddenly a 
ripple of laughter crossed her face and she said, 
“ We've got to get after those movies.” 
Mrs. Mason was a member of the Executive Com- 
mittee and for hours watched the bright lights of 
the moving picture show opposite her home. She 
saw the children playing about under the lights. She 
saw them beg to be taken in. She saw them go in 
unescorted. She talked with the neighbours about 
the “‘ movie show,” about the mysterious, dark in- 
fluences at work to undermine the children’s charac- 
ters. 
When the matter finally came up for official in- 
vestigation she had a deal of information. Then 
followed an investigation of many picture houses in 
the borough and of all picture houses in the school 
district. 
The committee visited these places afternoons and 
evenings. Then they detailed the violations of law 
to the association. The association decided to call 
a meeting of the managers of the moving picture 
houses. They came resenting the call and yet too 
cautious to stay away. 
The parents who had looked up the law on picture 
houses explained the law, described the violations
-P-A-G-E-126
  120 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
in each place that had been visited. They asked 
each manager to remedy the evils of presenting poor 
pictures, of badly lighted places, of allowing en- 
trance to unescorted children, of crowding men 
and women and children without regard to fire 
laws. 
Especially indignant was the father of two little 
boys, aged nine and seven, who had stayed away 
from school and had taken “ nickles” from their 
mother’s purse in order to go to the movie show. 
The parents demanded protection against condi- 
tions that were demoralising to the children. 
One of the managers present said, “ You can’t 
close up my place. I don’t care if you do take me 
to court; the most that can happen to me will be a 
fine. I can afford to pay a fine and make plenty of 
money besides.” 
The indignant father who had secured evidence 
against this man, presented the case in court. He 
was fined fifty dollars. 
A week later a second fine was | imposed upon the 
same man. In two weeks his house had to close 
its doors. Not only had the owner been fined but 
bulletins had been issued announcing the fact. Pub- 
lic opinion emptied his house. 
There was no more opposition to our demands. 
We were asked by the managers to visit and inspect
-P-A-G-E-127
  The Parents at Work 121 
their. premises and their pictures and to make sug- 
gestions for the betterment of both. 
The Parents’ Association had become a power for 
good in the neighbourhood. It had earned the con- 
fidence of the people.
-P-A-G-E-128
  CHAPTER V 
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IDEA KEEPS ON GROWING 
I 
Wuat the children needed was leadership and 
direction. 
When my family came to New York, I lost the 
companionship of open fields, grass, trees, flowers, 
sheep, streams, dark castles on the mountain sides. 
In their places were flats, dark stairs, and streets 
— paved streets with trucks and boys running wild, 
empty lots, waste heaps. My companionship with 
nature was lost. 
What a change, from the sunshine, the open fields, 
the folk stories, the friends, to this crowded city life! 
And yet what a wonderful place is a city. Here 
life is seething, moving, searching it knows not what 
— fellowship? Common ideals? 
The children left to themselves wandered mysti- 
fied, guessed, tried first this thing and then that, and 
failed. Few, very few, through some fortunate acci- 
dent, carried the dreams of their fathers into their 
lives. 
122 
   
-P-A-G-E-129
  Neighbourhood Idea Keeps Growing 123 
I wandered about with the rest of the children do- 
ing what we saw the older boys doing. Too young 
to find work for ourselves we imitated those who 
were experienced enough to turn to their own uses 
what the empty lots and paved streets offered. 
We played with pennies until the older ones took 
‘them from us. We used bad language because the 
older ones used bad language. We smoked for the 
same reason. We took what was on the vender’s 
wagon because the older ones praised us for doing 
it. We fought with our fists because the older ones 
encouraged us. 
The streets and the boys who owned the streets 
were our masters. They did the training. Our 
parents worried and wondered. They punished us 
when they caught us. We learned to deceive, to 
cheat, to lie, to fight. 
Through all this there was never a word of school. 
School had nothing to do with living and we were 
busy living. 
When we grew older we formed our own little 
club and held meetings in a corner of the cellar 
where no one could intrude. We built a theatre in 
one of the cellar store rooms. We took boards 
from the buildings and made benches. We searched 
for discarded mats and carpets. We ripped the 
“ thriller ads ” off the fences and pasted them on the 
walls of our theatre. We made a stage and a cur-
-P-A-G-E-130
Cae eee 
124 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
tain and gave our plays. What we needed to satisfy 
our dramatic instincts was leadership and a clean 
place. 
The cellar walls of an abandoned building made 
our playground. We stayed home from school and 
sailed planks on the water that had gathered between 
the decaying walls. We hopped from wall to wall, 
across openings, at the risk of life and limb. We 
fell into dirty water and made a fire to dry our 
clothes. We went home only when we felt we had 
to because we feared punishment. When we were 
late, we relied on our mothers to shield us. This 
was all bad for us, terribly bad. It was a life of 
chance with the chances all against us. What we 
needed to satisfy our play instincts was leadership 
and open spaces. 
Where these cellars stood twenty-five years ago, 
there are rows upon rows of flat houses, with stores 
and stables, and saloons and factories. 
Many crimes have been committed in the spot 
where we played truant from school. It was bad 
for us twenty-five years ago. It is worse for the 
children of to-day who must contend not against an 
indifferent, passive environment, but against an ag- 
gressive, sinful, depressing, fearful environment. 
Many times I have heard people say that the 
children who had it in them to become good men and 
women would become good men and women, and
-P-A-G-E-131
  
Neighbourhood Idea Keeps Growing 125 
children who had it in them to be bad would become 
bad. My experience has been different. I have 
seen perfectly fine boys go wrong through no fault of 
theirs. The school had driven them out and the 
home did not know what to do. I have seen beauti- 
ful natures with a passion for fine things, become 
discouraged, perverted, lost, and through no fault 
of theirs. The home was powerless to help. The 
school did not understand. 
What we needed as children was some one to 
show the way. Some one who knew us and valued 
us. Some one who would live with us and for us. 
What we needed as childrén; children still 
need. 
The teachers and I conscious of the dangers that 
come to an active child from a random seeking to 
satisfy his desires, tried to make the people whose 
children were about us realise their responsibility 
while we ourselves did our share. We knew the 
children needed the older folk. We knew that we 
had only limited means of gathering and holding 
these young people together. All we had was the 
school and we were fast losing that except as a drill 
machine running eight hours a day during which time 
two schools in turn tried to master the prescribed 
book facts. 
An eager little group of children waited at the 
door to speak to me as I left the school one after- 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  126 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
noon. I recognised the leader in one of the school 
plays. 
“Do you know,” he began after an exchange of 
greetings; “do you know that the Dramatic Club 
can’t meet any more?” 
“Yes,” I said. ‘I’m very sorry about it.” 
“ But what are we going to do?” and the anxious 
little faces pressed closer to me. ‘‘ We've no place 
to go. We can’t give it up,” the little fellow 
pleaded. 
“T don’t know what we’re going to do, son. The 
school is so crowded that we have to let two classes 
take turns in using a room so each room is used all 
day long. I’m trying to find some way out for 
you.” 
“We'll stay after school hours as we used to do.” 
“JT don’t think it would be right. You could not 
have a room until half-past four and it’s too late 
then and the teachers are tired. When the other 
new school opens there will be more room and we 
can begin again.” 
The school, after all, narrowing down to routine, 
was such a far-away place, far away from the actual 
lives of people. How could we get close, so close 
to each other that we would be part of the people 
and they a part of us, and be “ folksy ” together? 
A woman I knew of began by going into the 
crowded streets. She started in the spring, when
-P-A-G-E-133
  
Neighbourhood Idea Keeps Growing 127 
the houses were emptied of the children and the 
streets were filled with their shouts, their games, 
their squabbles. 
She arrived at the same time each afternoon. 
She began by going from one group of little mothers 
to another and helping them with their sewing. To 
some she loaned books, to others she told stories 
that were found in books. The boys were helped 
with their games. By and by there were excursions. 
The summer came and passed. School opened 
and when these children returned they were a little 
different from what they had been. They were bet- 
ter, less selfish, cleaner, in spite of the vacation. 
The cold weather came and it was evident that the 
street meetings would soon have to stop. 
Nobody had any money. There was a stranded 
old house on the block. No one lived init. Noone 
wanted to live in it. The “Street Lady” called 
upon the owner and got the use of the house for the 
asking. There was no furniture, no heat, no light- 
ing. But they began. 
Bits of matting and cast-off carpets, chairs with- 
out backs, chairs without seats, anything that could 
be made of service the children seized and carried 
to their house. Pictures, pictures out of magazines 
and newspapers, advertisements, moving picture 
idols were cut out and were pasted on the walls. 
An old stove was fed by the boys who brought
-P-A-G-E-134
  128 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
wood to heat the place. The library was a packing 
case. The books were just books, torn, dirty, dog- 
eared, battle-scarred by long and rough usage. But 
the books, the house, and all about it belonged to the 
children. 
Could we build such a place where the boys and 
the girls would work together, plan together, live 
together, grow together? 
We felt that it would be good for our children to 
have a house of their own to go to when they felt 
inclined. We felt that it would be good for the 
parents of the children to have a house that was dif- 
ferent from a school because its atmosphere was of 
hospitality; where the seats were ordinary chairs 
that invited one to sit and relax; the rooms, ordinary 
rooms cluttered with delightful evidences of human 
occupancy; the people ordinary people who could 
chat about every day things; the ways of living, the 
ordinary ways of living; and the doors opened be- 
cause they couldn’t find it in their hearts to stay 
shut. 
Our personal interest in the adults was always 
secondary. We worked with them because we could 
get no results if we ignored them. Our primary in- 
terest was the child. What we sought was com- 
- \plete living for him. 
The most popular meeting place for the parents 
had not been the school but the Hall. This was a
-P-A-G-E-135
  
Neighbourhood Idea Keeps Growing 129 
great bare room in back of the candy shop, where 
we were welcome any time,— a most convenient ar- 
rangement when a meeting had to be called at short 
notice. 
In the Hall we held our annual dinners. The 
food was cooked by the mothers in their own kitchens 
and taken to the Hall. The neighbours loaned the 
chairs for the diners. On these occasions the cellar 
was dressed up for a reception room and a very ac- 
ceptable one it made. 
It was a wonderful spirit that could work and hold 
a group of people together under such conditions. 
The people were big and strong and united. There 
. was always the promise of bigger things to come. 
What change might the next day bring? When 
people are sacrificing, striving, they forget to think 
of themselves. They think of the idea only, and the 
idea marches on. 
Many conferences were held in the Hall. We 
discussed again and again the need of a settlement. 
We needed leaders who would make it their busi- 
ness to live with the problems of the people, with the 
problems of the children. The only way to get these 
leaders was through the establishment of a settle- 
ment. 
Our friends’ sympathies were enlisted and through 
their generosity a settlement house was founded. 
The house selected was a mansion set on a big plot 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  130 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
of grass with shade trees. The apartment houses 
towering on all sides of it had driven the owners 
away. They were glad to find a market for it. 
Some repairs and alterations were necessary be- 
fore the house could be used. Who was to take 
charge while the workmen were busy —and how 
could we use the lawn and shade trees at once for 
the little children? 
We had overlooked my father. He had come 
into the school every now and then, looked about, 
stayed an hour or two, smiled and gone home. 
Now that there was work to do, he put his cot in 
one of the rooms, and had his meals sent in. To 
him the settlement like the school meant a place for 
children. As soon as he appeared they gathered 
about him. Slowly, softly he smiled and told them 
stories, and then more stories. He spoke in broken 
English, and in gestures, but the children understood. 
Again Crusaders marched; again the goblins grinned 
in unsuspected places in this house of dark rooms, 
plaster, paints, papers, windows, boards, packed 
furniture. Once more he was a soldier on his 
charger, and once more little children listened and 
adored. 
At night favoured ones were allowed to come and 
stay with him. They came bringing their blankets. 
His one steady companion was a child on crutches 
who followed Father all about the lawn and the
-P-A-G-E-137
  Neighbourhood Idea Keeps Growing 131 
house. The two had long intimate talks and many, 
many laughs. 
During the day the baby carriages rolled in over 
the lawn and under the shade of the trees, and the 
small boys actually hushed themselves that the baby 
brothers and sisters might sleep. 
Early one day in that first summer the calm was 
broken by a voice shrieking: ‘It’s fierce. Soup 
meat for twenty-two cents. How can poor people 
live?” It was Ruth’s voice and a teacher hurried 
toward the rapidly growing knot of people about 
her. A flourish with a little stick toward the audi- 
ence pointed the question. 
“Sure, sure—that is right,” they murmured. 
“ And chicken! Full of sands their insides are and 
for that thirty-two cents. The thieves, the mur- 
derers, they’ll starve us!” Fiercer plunges with the 
little stick and more assenting murmurs. 
The crowd began to warm up. The teacher tried 
to edge closer to the speaker. 
Now Ruth broke into Yiddish, still carrying the 
crowd with her, at the end of her sharp little stick 
and sharper little tongue. 
Then in unmistakable English she called out, 
“Come, stand up, we'll break their windows, 
we'll —” 
Now thoroughly alarmed, the teacher pushed close 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  132 Ce Schoolmaster.of the Great City 
to Ruth. Immediately her face broke into smiles, 
“ Ah, here’s our school. They’ll help us,” and Ruth 
poured out her story. 
“Bring your friends over to the House, Ruth, 
and we'll talk it over there.” 
Led by “the school” and Ruth, the group 
marched over to the House and the first of numerous 
meetings were held on the meat strike. 
As time passed the clubs began to voice the need 
that the school had voiced so many times before the 
need for play space. 
Twice the school, its people and its teachers had 
secured a temporary summer playground in the park 
opposite the school. Twice when the playground 
had been removed, they were disappointed. Then 
the settlement and the school decided that the time 
had come to secure a permanent playground. A 
conference was called at the settlement, to which the 
city officials came. A playground in front of the 
school was demanded. We wanted an organised 
playground conducted by a teacher, one who knew 
how to lead children to play. 
We were all familiar with free play, absolute free 
play, digging about in ash heaps, pouring dirty water 
from one mud hole to another, fights, pulling the 
pedlar’s pack, baseball where the older took what 
they needed from the younger. We wanted a super-
-P-A-G-E-139
Neighbourhood Idea Keeps Growing 133 
vised playground, where the various group activities 
were controlled by an idea and where sportsmanship 
and not force held sway. 
Twice the school had tried and failed, twice it had 
succeeded only partially; now hand in hand with 
the settlement and a public-spirited park commis- 
sioner, we succeeded in securing a permanent play- 
ground for the use of the neighbourhood children. 
We were all sure of a place at last where the boys 
who wanted to play could go and be free to shout, to 
compete, to win, to lose, to breathe deeply and to 
drink in the sunshine and the wind. 
The settlement, seeing as the school had seen that 
language difficulty was one cause of separation be- 
tween parents and children, began the work of 
teaching mothers English. Each morning a group 
of mothers gathered in one of the club rooms. The 
babies were left in the game room in charge of a 
house leader, and the mothers laboriously prepared 
to go through simple English exercises. 
Some day the school itself will bridge over the 
gap that exists between English speaking children 
and non-English speaking parents, by helping the 
children to teach the parents in the school building 
itself and during school hours. 
Each month ten thousand children, men, women 
of all ages, went in and out of the settlement house. 
Music, drawing, sewing, civic clubs, athletic clubs, 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  134 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
literary clubs, occupied all the space there was. 
Michael and his mother were there. So were the 
Flannigans and their group. We looked upon the 
settlement as a moving, living force whose idea was 
one of service and not of power. Free from tradi- 
tion, we felt that it would be the neighbourhood 
social experimental station, finding out, working out, 
and then beginning again, never stopping long 
enough to standardise. We felt it would always 
be open hearted because it prided itself on the big- 
ness of the new opportunities. Through it the peo- 
ple would be drawn together more closely and neigh- 
bourhood idealism result. It gave us the hope that 
some day the school itself would be a bigger thing 
than it had ever been before. 
Il 
Many new children were admitted to the school 
in the spring. They came, they stayed till the cold 
weather and then went away. 
“This is a shifting population,” said my friend 
the real estate man. “It’s better than it was but it’s 
still bad. They are beginning to settle however. 
They don’t change as much as they used to. Why, 
of the fifty-two flat houses I have charge of, twenty- 
eight were empty, completely empty from October 
to May. When they come they want a month’s ’
-P-A-G-E-141
    Neighbourhood Idea Keeps Growing 135 
rent free. When they go they forget to pay the last 
month’s rent. I wish they would stop moving.” 
“So do I. Our changes of class registers are tre- 
mendous. Some years our transfer figures are 
larger than our register.” 
“They'll stop soon,” he added. ‘‘ They come up 
trom the crowded East Side. They move up here 
for the summer season to get the air. In fall they 
hzve been in the habit of returning to their winter 
quarters. You see, there are two parks here and 
plenty of open lots. These folks can’t afford to go 
to the country so they come here. A great many of 
them are sick, too. Go through the park in the 
morning and see the men and women on the benches. 
Some of them are tubercular; all of them need fresh 
air.” 
This then was the reason that the school kept the 
local doctors busy, that we were not satisfied with the 
little that the Board of Health doctor and nurse 
could do and had begun to group our doctor friends 
into departments — nerve doctors, eye doctors, and 
the rest. This was the reason for the increase in 
our classes for atypical children, the anemic children, 
for groups of children with special defects, bad feet, 
bad speech, bad spines, bad eyes. 
But what had this to do with us? We had been 
trained as teachers, not as doctors. Why should we 
use time and energy that should be given to the
-P-A-G-E-142
  136 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
three R’s, and allow children to rest, to sleep, to do’ 
special physical exercises in the school? 
Whatever has to do with the growth of the child 
has to do with the teacher. No one can teach a sick 
child. It cannot be done. The building, the equip- 
ment, the books, the teacher, are all wasted on the 
sick child. A sound mind rarely dwells in a sick 
body. 
The local doctors had been giving their services 
freely and gladly as the school needed them. They 
had been ahead of the parents in their service be- 
cause their contribution was definite and could be 
made any time they were called upon. But as there 
was no hospital near the school where the people 
could take their children for treatment, a great many 
times children’s ailments were allowed to go unat- 
tended because the distance to the nearest hospital 
was too great. 
The examination and care of abnormal children, 
always a difficult problem, had been a severe drain 
upon the school, because the institutions that could 
help were far from home. ‘The teachers gave their 
afternoons and Saturdays to this work but even that 
was not sufficient. 
I saw the doctors grouped, and the people help- 
ing, and I realised that the school was already build- 
ing its hospital. What was needed was its concrete 
embodiment as an institution. The people, and the
-P-A-G-E-143

doctors secured a charter from the state authorities 
and began work at once by opening a dispensary. 
Shortly after the dispensary opened a Russian 
Jew presented himself at the office in school. He 
was very much afraid of intruding but he had some- 
thing to say that had to be said, he explained, hold- 
ing out a strong, white hand and smiling across at 
me with the kindliest brown eyes imaginable. 
Wondering, I placed a chair and waited for his 
story. He laid aside his big soft hat and little black 
bag. 
“You open a hospital, my friend?” he said. “I 
am a doctor. I would help.” 
I was about to explain that he must apply to the 
Board of Directors, but he checked me and went on. 
“We are Russian doctors —me and my wife. 
We lived in a little town in Russia. Always we 
worked for the sick. No difference, Jew or Gen- 
tile. From morning till night, all night when they 
needed us, we worked for them. If they could pay 
it was good. If they could not, it was alike good. 
“When we did not think of trouble it came. They 
rushed to kill us. Even the sick people we worked 
for — they came to kill us. I pushed my wife in 
the cellar, I fight, then I hide. See this scar on my 
hand — that I get from Russia. 
“By and by we make our way to France, then to 
America. America gave us a home, it gave us work.
-P-A-G-E-144
    138 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
Now we want to pay back some little. We want to 
work for the sick children under the flag. 
“Tn Russia I learned to cure the lame children. 
Show me some. I am a— how you say in English 
—a masseur doctor.” 
We set him to work and his energy and enthusiasm 
were wonderful. 
One day he caught my arm as I passed his room 
in the dispensary. His face was transfigured, the 
tears shone in his eyes as he dragged me in. 
“See, my friend, see, he walks. The little fel- 
low, he walks again. I have made it so, I am like 
your Jesus Christ — I make him walk again, the lit- 
tle fellow. I am so happy.” 
Ul 
Within three years after I had come to ‘“ My 
School,” another school had opened its doors. But 
still we were all overcrowded. We demanded ad- 
ditional room. The classes increased in size and 
number. We asked for more schools and waited. 
But there was no relief. It was always in the com- 
ing. ‘There were conferences, there were petitions, 
there were public meetings, there were local news- 
paper demands, there were letters aplenty, all deal- 
ing with the need for additional school accommoda- 
tions. Temporary quarters were rented. But
-P-A-G-E-145
  Neighbourhood Idea Keeps Growing 139 
these were of little help. When the movement of 
population sets in a certain direction, there is no 
help; at least no ordinary help will do. 
The president of the Parents’ Association, who 
had been the most insistent person on school accom- 
modations, headed a church committee and with the 
aid of our real estate man secured property on the 
northern edge of the school district and began a 
school building for which the people belonging to 
the church furnished the funds. 
““T want you to go over the plans of the building 
with me,” he told me one day as he came into the 
office with a roll of papers under his arm. 
“ There are to be sixteen classrooms, and an audi- 
torium accommodating four hundred, with regular 
auditorium seats, not the desks we’ve had to use 
here— No more knee cramping, no more sitting 
doubled up when we hold our Parents’ Association 
meetings. There will be a fine stage for dramatic 
work. In the cellar a large gymnasium is planned 
and the children can use the swimming pool. It is 
already in the building, marble, with filtered water. 
It is planned to have a roof playground in addition. 
The library is across the street. This will be a fine 
building. I have tried to put in it everything you 
hawe been telling us a school should have. There 
is room for shops, and a music room. It will be 
finished in two years.”
-P-A-G-E-146
  140 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
“‘ Those are fine plans,” I said. ‘* Your pastor is 
a first rate architect. The whole thing is wonder- 
ful. We are a lucky neighbourhood. Only yester- 
day the park commissioner gave us a plot for a gar- 
den in the park. It is located near the pond. And 
about four months ago a lady came and talked over 
the project of opening up a children’s nursery. She 
has already secured a house not far from your pro- 
posed building.”

When the over-large school recognised its social 
limitations and possibilities, it recognised also the 
need of a home visitor, a woman experienced in the 
ways of the world, who knew things that a young 
teacher could not possibly know, who could grasp the 
neighbourhood problems and handle’them most ef- 
fectively. 
The Henry Street Nurses’ Settlement had a branch 
in our district. Now and then the teachers had come 
across the nurses in their visits to the home. The 
teacher had gone to ask about a neglected child, the 
nurse, to see the child’s sick mother. Many times 
‘the teacher and nurse worked together. When the 
school needed a home visitor because the teachers 
were too tired and the work become too heavy, 
the nurse suggested a woman “who had years of 
experience in meeting the people’s problems.”
-P-A-G-E-147

“ Thus Aunt Margaret”? came tous. We begged 
money for her salary. Those who gave it were our 
neighbours, the people with whom and for whom 
she would have to work. 
The machinery of Aunt Margaret’s department 
was simple. The human quality of it kept it and 
made it so. A little pasteboard box that suggested 
shoes, and a little black bag that suggested efficiency 
were about all that was visible —and of course 
“ Aunt Margaret.” In the black bag were the rec- 
ords of the cases for the day, and a list of all the 
children’s welfare agencies, addresses and telephone 
calls, a street directory, a note book and pencil, a 
handkerchief, a change purse and some chocolate for 
children. All very simple and very human and most 
efficient. 
The first day Aunt Margaret appeared, a teacher 
came into the office looking very dejected. She had 
made a visit to the home of a child whose appear- 
ance indicated extreme neglect and the mother had 
ordered her out. The family lived in a basement. 
The teacher had knocked and entered. The mother 
met her silently. Her clothes were unsightly and 
the condition of the rooms was desperate. Scarcely 
anything was clean. The teacher at once had begun 
to explain to the parent that her child needed wash- 
ing, needed clothes, and that a mother should not be 
so careless as to permit the child to go to school in
-P-A-G-E-148
142 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
such a disgraceful condition. Whereupon the par- 
ent had upbraided the teacher for coming to her 
house to find fault. 
“You have no right,” she had said, “‘ to come here 
and talk about mine kid. Mind your own business. 
Teach mine kid and leave her clothes alone. What 
do you know about mine troubles, with your fur coat 
and your feathers in your hat? Go away.” 
And the teacher had come back to school and 
poured forth a tirade against home visits and against 
superiors that required home visits and against the 
school that encouraged such visits. 
Aunt Margaret took up the story and the job. 
“How do you do this morning? The teacher 
told me you weren’t feeling very well so I just ran 
over to see you. How’s the little girl?” she asked. 
“Now don’t disturb yourself. Sit right down on 
that chair. I'll get one for myself.” 
Before she knew what was happening to her the 
woman found herself in the most comfortable chair 
in the room and “ Aunt Margaret” waiting upon 
her. 
“ My mother was ill a long time before I lost her 
and I learned how to make her more comfortable. 
She used to like to have me brush her hair. She said 
it rested her,” Aunt Margaret chatted amiably. 
Her hands were already fumbling about among the
-P-A-G-E-149
  Neighbourhood Idea Keeps Growing 143 
sick woman’s hairpins and during the brushing proc 
ess the two became very confidential. 
“Are you from the school?” 
“Yes. I belong to it. The teacher told me you 
were sick,” said Aunt Margaret. 
“Such a fresh teacher! She comes in and says 
mine kid is dirty and I should shame myself. Mine 
God — I have such a sore on mine leg and mine arm 
that I can’t move. I pull mine hair like crazy.” 
“ But the teacher didn’t know that,” interposed 
the visitor. 
“Sure she don’t. Then for why she makes a face 
at mine kid and says she is too dirty to be by the 
other kids. She’s got no sores nor no kids neither. 
Like a grand lady she is with her high heels and 
feathers and powder on her nose. Never she come 
here again, I quick slam the door in her face. The 
fresh thing!” 
“ Have you had the doctor?” asked Aunt Mar- 
garet. 
“Yes, once I go by the doctor and he say, ‘ My 
dear woman, you must go to the hospital. You can’t 
pay me for this job. It cost you a hundred dollars 
maybe.’ How can I go to hospital? They will not 
take mine kid and the society will get her. Maybe I. 
lose mine husband. He not come by me in hos 
pital.”
-P-A-G-E-150
  144 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
“T know a good doctor who will come and see 
you right here. He belongs to the school like me, 
and he will take care of you for nothing,” and the 
deft fingers put in the last hairpin. 
“Maybe he say for nothing and then charge me 
big money,” and suspicion looked out of her eyes 
for an instant. 
“No, he won’t. He isn’t like that. Now I'll 
get the little girl ready for school and I’ll come back 
very soon with the doctor.” 
When the doctor came he said the “‘ sores” were 
very bad. 
“She must have a nurse here to dress these every 
day. She should really be in a hospital,” he ex- 
plained to the school visitor. 
The woman cried out sharply —‘‘ No, no. I lose 
mine kid if I go by hospital. Maybe I die. No, I 
stay home.” 
Aunt Margaret asked the Nurses Settlement for 
help and one of the blue gowned nurses called every 
day until the patient was cured. 
In the meantime the little girl fell ill. Nothing 
we could do could save her. Neglect and poverty 
had weakened her so that when pneumonia attacked 
her she died. Aunt Margaret helped from first to 
last. 
Some weeks later the mother came to school. 
““T come to say good-bye,” she said. “I go with
-P-A-G-E-151
  
Neighbourhood Idea Keeps Growing 145 
mine husband in the country. But first I say good- 
bye to the school, mine friend, never I forget. So 
good you were, so kind. When I come back I come 
to see you, how you look. I wish you health —” 
A few words of explanation was all that: Aunt 
Margaret needed, for she was keen where children 
were concerned and knew what to do. 
Were the children dirty? Somehow they were 
made clean. Were they hungry? Then they were 
fed. Were they brought before the children’s 
court, Aunt Margaret was sure to be there to plead 
their cause. Was father out of work? A job was 
dug up out of somewhere. One thought twice be- 
fore getting into trouble, for while she helped you 
out, you got a stinging, blistering raking over when 
she had pulled you out. 
Peter, one of the highlights in 4A, stole some 
pigeons. The indignant owner had him arrested 
and hauled to the Court. 
Peter’s father and Aunt Margaret appeared with 
him. 
“T didn’t steal ’em,” said Peter, looking the judge 
straight in the eye —‘‘I took ’em.”’ Aunt Mar- 
garet gasped and the father made frantic gestures 
towards Peter. 
“But they were not yours. What do you call 
stealing?” 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  146 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
“When I take it and I ain’t got the right.” 
“Exactly. Now what right had you to those 
pigeons? ” 
“They eat my pigeons’ feed. He never hardly 
feeds his and they come and eat my feed.” 
“Ts that all you have to say, Peter?” and the 
judge’s eyes searched Peter’s face. 
“ And —a—I wanted the fantail.” 
“Exactly. Then you stole, Peter, and I ought 
to lock you up.” 
Peter hung his head. 
Turning to Aunt Margaret the judge said, “ What 
kind of a boy is he in school?” 
“He’s a first rate boy. We've never heard a 
word against him. His teacher says his lessons are 
very good. I think he made a mistake, your 
Honour. Perhaps you could give him another 
chance and we'll keep an eye on him. He’s really a 
good boy.” 
Peter looked up gratefully. 
“Tf I let you go home with your father and this 
lady this time,” said the judge, “ will you promise 
me not to take anything that isn’t yours — even if 
you think you have a good excuse?” 
“ Sure — I mean — Yes, sir.” 
“Very well. Are you willing to take charge of 
him?” the judge said to Aunt Margaret. “ You'll 
be responsible for him and if he does anything like
-P-A-G-E-153
  
Neighbourhood Idea Keeps Growing 147 
this again you'll have to bring him back here to 
me.” 
“Yes, I'll take him,” said Aunt Margaret, ‘“‘ and 
T’ll see he doesn’t come back.” 
On the way home Aunt Margaret took a hand at 
Peter. 
“Look here — young man — stealing is stealing 
and there'll be none of it in your family. Do you 
understand? I'll take a look at those pigeons of 
yours every so often and if I find one there that I 
don’t know about —I’ll empty that coop — every 
last one of them will fly over your head. Mind 
that.” 
“T have more trouble,” said my assistant to Aunt 
Margaret, “ with ninety-nine, ninety-nine than with 
any other house in the district. It seems to me that 
anybody who is dirty, or sick or a truant lives there. 
I wish it would disappear off the face of the earth,” 
and the assistant slammed down a bundle of papers 
on her desk. ‘‘ Every one of those slips stands for 
somebody in ninety-nine, ninety-nine —I wish I 
could find out what sort of a place-that is.” 
“Aunt Margaret” reached for the slips and 
dropped them into her black bag, saying, “ I’ll look 
in to-day and tell you what I find.” 
Later in the day she stopped at the school to re- 
port.
-P-A-G-E-154
    148 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
“Well, I should say there was something wrong 
about that house. It’s awful, I don’t believe it’s had 
a coat of paint since it was built. The fire escapes 
are jammed. The first floor stairway looks like a 
dump. It’s a wonder everybody in the house isn’t 
sick. I’ve asked all the departments in sight for 
help, and they’ve all promised to get busy. The 
landlord says all he does is paint and paper but I 
don’t believe it. I am going to make him show me. 
“ But I don’t think we'll get very far at that. I 
went in to Mary Ann’s mother about her hair and 
what do you think she said? ‘And what of that? 
Sure she has them. We all have them. It’s a sign 
of good health.’ Did you ever hear anything to 
equal that?” 
“Lots,” said the assistant. ‘‘ Lots, I’ve heard a 
book since I began to get after ninety-nine, ninety- 
nine.” 
“ Well, we'll see what the Board of Health and the 
Tenement Department will do for us,” and Aunt 
Margaret gathered up her belongings and went 
home. 
“How’s ninety-nine, ninety-nine?” my assistant 
asked her a while later. 
“ Fine, we're a little cleaner. The children are 
looking better. I’m going around there this morn- 
ing though to see Mary Ann. She isn’t much bet- 
ter.”
-P-A-G-E-155

In a short time the school visitor returned. She 
was angry. 
“Tf that place isn’t the limit. I’ve just had it 
cleaned up and it’s as bad as ever. I went in to see 
about Mary Ann and the minute I stepped into the 
hall I smelled something. I walked to the back and 
there under the stairs was a dirty old mattress and a 
heap of old rags and the smell of cats — I went hot- 
foot for the janitor. 
“What can I do?’ he said. ‘I told you you 
couldn’t keep this place clean. It ain’t my fault. 
I don’t make the people. Now you see it for your- 
self. I got my troubles and they ain’t yours. 
Yours ain’t mine neither,’ and he turned his back on 
me and started to walk off. 
“Who put that stuff there?’ I demanded. 
“* How should I know? I guess it was Rebecca’s 
family.’ 
“T went right up and asked Rebecca’s mother 
why she put that stuff out there and she said, ‘I 
didn’t put it there, the kids did.’ 
“* What did you let them do it for?’ 
“T should let them do it? She asks me I should 
let the kids? They don’t ask me. They put it 
there for a place for their cats.’ 
“© Their cats!’ I exclaimed. 
“*Sure, ain’t they got any rights? The teacher 
of the Board of Health says they can’t keep no cats

in the house cause it ain’t healthy. She says it makes 
sores on the baby, those cats. Then the kids put 
them in a place under the stairs. I ain’t got any- 
thing to do by it.’ She waved her arms overhead 
and shouted at me till I was deaf and dizzy.” Aunt 
Margaret was out of breath. 
“What did you do?” asked the assistant. 
“T got the rubbish man to take the stuff out. 
Now I’m going to get rid of those cats.” 
She picked up the telephone and began talking. 
“Yes, a lot of cats, Ninety-nine, ninety-nine. 
“Catch them? No, I didn’t. How can I catch 
them? Will you go up with your wagon and try? 
Tl catch what I can.” 
“Now, what do you think of that?” said Aunt 
Margaret as she hung up the receiver. “ He says 
did I catch the cats?” 
There were the dance halls and the moving picture 
shows always likely to become a serious menace to 
moral growth. To cope with the conditions, the 
school visitor had to stay in the district nights, Sat- 
urdays and Sundays. She had to find out exactly 
what went on, who the leaders were, what tempta- 
tions were put before the children to attract and 
keep them, and then to act in accord with this in- 
formation, appealing to the law, to welfare societies, 
and to the parents, individually and collectively. 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  Neighbourhood Idea Keeps Growing 151 
Usually reports of this kind made to the group 
of parents evoked more interest and enthusiasm than 
any other kind. The visitor’s vigorous crusades al- 
ways resulted in better conditions. 
Vv 
But somehow I already had the feeling that the 
very presence of Aunt Margaret, even though she 
belonged to the school and to the people, was ulti- 
mately tending towards keeping the people out of 
the school and the school out of the home. She was 
here, there, everywhere. The people met her in the 
streets, inthe homes. The more efficient Aunt Mar- 
garet became the more the parents relied on her and 
stayed home, the more the teachers stayed in the 
schoolhouse and relied on her. I had the same idea 
about the doctors, the settlement leaders, the civic 
club. I wondered if the price the school had to 
pay for efficiency was a loss of the personal element, 
the very thing we had worked hard to obtain. 
The school had stood alone, an imposing struc- 
ture; about it a tall iron-spiked fence with gates that 
opened and shut at the appointed hour. Scarcely a 
soul that was not a pupil, a teacher, or a school of- 
ficial, had ventured through its gates. They had 
passed, repassed, looked up, wondered what might 
be going on inside and then passed on thinking, 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
152 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
“What handsome buildings our school houses 
are!” 
I had come and asked the people to stop. They 
had stopped. By ones and twos they had come 
through the gates. Then we had gone on together, 
parents and teachers, sharing the children’s prob- 
lems. We had worked individually and collectively 
to push the school out into the neighbourhood. 
““My school” had become ‘Our School.” The 
teachers’ school had become the people’s school. 
Through its efforts to get the people as the back- 
ground for the spiritual growth of the children the 
school had succeeded in starting the mass movement. 
And then what had happened? The energy of the 
mass had begun to divide itself almost at the very 
moment of its greatest unity. Each group had be- 
gun to interpret the idea of service in terms of its 
own experience. Each had begun to think, ‘‘ Mine 
is the most important work.” 
Those that had helped to care for the sick de- 
veloped the dispensary. They believed this was the 
great neighbourhood need. 
Those that had been talking about overcrowded 
school conditions built a school. They believed this 
was the great neighbourhood need. 
Those that wanted the inspiration of personal 
leadership formed a settlement. They believed this 
was the great neighbourhood need.  
-P-A-G-E-159
  
Neighbourhood Idea Keeps Growing 153 
Those that wanted the spread of knowledge on 
civic problems organised a forum. They believed 
this was the great neighbourhood need. 
We had thought our worries were over, and they 
were only beginning in a new way. I realised that 
the problem the school was now facing was one com- 
Jmon to many schools. There was scarcely a con- 
gested school district in the city that had not its set- 
tlement, its library, its hospital, its park, its charit- 
able organisations, its civic bodies. Would the 
school be equal to the task of keeping the social 
forces working together, the children always as the 
centre of united effort? ; 
There was no answer. And yet I knew that the 
school must accept the challenge or again stand alone 
while the crowd passed by its gates. The school 
that had started the mass movement and had watched 
it take its course would now have to regather the 
mass and start it off once more.
-P-A-G-E-160
  CHAPTER VI 
OUR SCHOOL 
I 
WHILE the school was engaged in the process of 
getting the parent to feel the power that comes 
through united effort, what was the school doing 
within its own doors to reflect the larger freedom 
and the closer human touches of the world outside its 
doors? What was the reaction of all this upon the 
life of the school? Very slight, I confessed to my- 
self. The classroom work went on very much in the 
same way. Why was this? 
I went back to my own experiences as a teacher. 
Many times I had the feeling of bondage. I was 
just one in a great machine and as long as I stayed 
in my particular corner that was sufficient. 
The days slipped by in a monotonous repetition, 
“number for ten examples— If a man had,—” 
of bells, marchings, piles of yellow paper that 
seemed to distribute themselves to the deadening, 
chant ‘‘ Write your name, class, and date at the head 
of the paper. . . . Skip a line. Begin one inch in 
154
-P-A-G-E-161
Our School 155 
from the left side! Monitors collect. . . . Mark 
time, march,”— and the day was over. 
This kind of work I had to do day in and day out. 
Going home nights I was weary. (There is no bond- 
age so deadly as that which prohibits intellectual 
liberty.) Intellectual slavery was what school teach- 
ing had meant to me at that time. It should not 
mean that for these teachers if I could prevent it. 
I looked for individual strength in the teacher and 
put that strength on the work where it would tell. 
I felt that the teacher would grow only when allowed 
to use her best talent in behalf of the children. 
Teachers’ hobbies was what “‘ my school ” needed. 
| The anemic class was given to one type of teacher, 
the atypical class to another, the backward class to 
another, the posture cases to one group, the speech 
cases to another, the disciplinary cases to the Child’s 
Interest Committee. What we did for the special 
children during school time we now tried to do for 
the normal children, but this had to be done after 
school hours and in the teacher’s own time. 
The lover of flowers organised the Nature Study 
walks, the lover of music organised the Choral Club, 
the literary groups became the editorial staff of the 
school paper and the Story Telling club. Teachers 
grouped themselves according to individual tastes 
and inclinations. There were committees on festi- 
vals, athletics, dancing, embroidery classes, art rv
-P-A-G-E-162
  156 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
classes, manual training classes. The children se- 
lected the class they wanted to join and soon the 
school hummed with the sounds of these different 
afternoon “shops.” But one must finish his day’s 
allotment of the classroom work before he could re- 
lax in the shops. 
I was going the rounds of the building late one 
afternoon, as was my habit. This was a long time 
after I had become principal. I passed the assem- 
bly room. It was full of groups of children and 
teachers. Some were rehearsing, some were talk- 
ing, some were just looking on and smiling. In an- 
other room I found a group of boys and girls making 
paper hats. In another half a dozen were drawing, 
putting in colour, motion, ideas, and each proud be- 
cause the drawing belonged to him. 
I went on. It was late. School as such had 
closed its doors long since. Yet here were half a 
dozen teachers and a hundred or more children 
working, laughing, growing together. 
I went into another room. A teacher was sitting 
there with a group of children about her. They 
had papers all about them. Now and then they 
stopped to read one aloud and the teacher and the 
children would say, “‘ Let’s save that one. That’s 
a real good story.”
-P-A-G-E-163
  
Our School 157 
When they saw me standing near them they looked 
up. 
‘““We are picking out the good ones that are to 
go into the school paper,” and the teacher added, 
“See what Isaac has written.” 
THE WIND 
Oh! How I’d like to be the wind! I’d scamper all over 
the world. 
I'd blow so softly, that the buds would say, ‘‘ Spring is 
coming. Let’s put on our bonnets of bright colours.” 
If I were at sea I would whisper into the captain’s ear, 
“ Spring is coming.” 
Oh! Oh! I'd have a jolly time frolicing all the day 
long. 
I went out of the room smiling, feeling that the 
children were getting a sense of values, a sense of 
joyousness, a sense of laughter with their prod- 
uct. ‘ 
The regular classroom, however, with its fixed 
curriculum seemed the hardest to reach. It seemed 
almost impossible to vitalise the curriculum by means 
of first hand experiences or to push the classroom out 
into the world. There was no time for the cultural 
values here. The classes were large, the per cent. 
standard high, and the time limited. 
A geography teacher who dropped into the office 
one afternoon epitomised this situation.
-P-A-G-E-164
  158 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
He was short and chubby —the sort that never 
stands if he can sit and never sits up if he can lie 
down, and the more sofa pillows the better. 
He slid down into a chair and when his hands 
had found their accustomed pockets and coins and 
keys he made his plaint. 
“*Fead’ came in to-day. Gave me a ‘ Sugges- 
tive outline’ for a geography lesson. Says it'll 
‘stimulate thought and imagination.’ Make you 
dizzy. Wait ’n’ I'll read it.” 
Searching about in his pocket he drew out a note 
book and read: ‘“‘ Michael Zunich’s father is going 
to move his family to Wilkesbarre next week. This 
family came from the mining district of Austria. 
They are going to the mining district of Pennsyl- 
vania. Get Michael to tell his experiences in the 
old country, his voyage to New York. Get class to 
see why his father is going to Pennsylvania rather 
than stay in New York. Go over the route from 
New York to Wilkesbarre, the distance, the cost, 
the time. Compare the coal and iron industries of 
the two countries. Get Michael to promise to write 
to the class to answer the questions that he can’t an- 
swer now.” 
“Sounds interesting,” I ventured. ‘‘ Did you try 
it out?” 
He snuggled further down into his wide collar and 
comfortable pockets.
-P-A-G-E-165
  Our School 159 
“T certainly did not. That class has to learn the 
stuff that’ll pass exams. When they come up for 
promotion, will anybody ask them to follow Zunich’s 
old man around the globe? They emphatically will 
not. Where’s Wilkesbarre? What’s the principal 
industry? What railroad? Just like that. That’s 
what they need. Well, I’m off. Had a long day. 
Good-bye.” 
Gently he eased himself out of his chair. 
“Good-bye,” I answered. ‘‘ Thanks for show- 
ing me the outline. You know I rather like that no- 
tion?” 
“Which?” and he stopped in the doorway. 
“Oh, the suggestive outline? Stimulate thought, 
et cetera. Sure, I’m going to give it. I'll take the 
time from the literature. ‘Head’s’ a good fellow. 
Do it just to please her. Good-bye.” 
A line from my old history flashed into my 
thoughts: ‘“‘ Dense and impenetrable forests lay be- 
tween him and the entrenched enemy.” 
The classrooms were too strongly entrenched. I 
must try to break through by a new route — the 
school assembly. 
The strongest impression of an assembly exercise I 
had carried away from my attendance at public 
school was that of the principal, day after day, read- 
ing to the assembled group, a chapter at a time, the 
story of “ Black Beauty.” He could read wonder-
-P-A-G-E-166
    160 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
fully well. The children understood every word he 
-said. He held us spellbound as he read through the 
story. 
It was the cumulative effect of this reading that 
impressed me. The rest of the exercises never 
touched me. They were pieced up of odds and ends, 
— a recitation, a song, a quotation, with no relation 
of one to the other. 
I never recall them without chuckling over the 
funny side of one disastrous November morning. 
We took turns in furnishing the “ entertainment.” 
This gave us each about two weeks to prepare. The 
morning I speak of fell to 4B. The luckless teacher 
had forgotten to give out the quotations until the 
night before and then in a perfect panic distributed 
the three stanzas of “The Rainy Day” to three 
pupils, conjuring them by all they held dear to be 
ready to recite them in the assembly the next morn- 
ing. 
That morning it rained as thoroughly and com- 
pletely as a November sky could rain when it was 
in earnest about it. The wind came in great gusts 
sending the leaves and dead twigs up against the win- 
dow panes where they tapped as if eager to get in 
from the storm outside. 
Few children came to school and the big Assem- 
bly hall was scarcely one-third full. The children 
started bravely to sing America, but their voices echo-
-P-A-G-E-167
  
Our School 161 
ing strangely, frightened them and they trailed out 
miserably at the end. ; 
The principal rose and with all his accustomed 
grace and art read from the Bible the story of the 
man who built a great gallows for his enemy and was 
himself hanged upon it. 
“So they hanged Haman on the gallows he had 
prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath 
pacified.” The sonorous voice rolled through the 
silent room. The children sat scared and motion- 
less. 
He sent a sweeping glance over the room and 
solemnly closed the great Book. This was 4B’s cue. 
The first child rose in his place and in a thin, little 
piping voice announced — 
“The day is cold and dark and dreary,” 
Swish, swish came the rain on the windows tap, 
crack, and a twig rapped smartly against them: 
“Tt rains,— it rains ’— 
the piping voice stumbled, stopped, and the child sat 
down. 
The second child rose and began tremblingly, 
“ My life is cold and dark and dreary —” 
His voice trailed away and the storm once again 
filled the silence. A merciful teacher signalled the
-P-A-G-E-168
  162 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
boy to sit, and the third one rose and announced in a 
startlingly loud and commanding tone — 
“ Be still —” 
The principal swung about in his direction and 
looked at him fiercely. That was fatal. : 
“ Be still,” again declared the boy, and ceased. 
“You have said it, my son,” boomed the principal. 
“We will omit the closing song.” 
Aside from this single exception of ‘“ Black 
Beauty,” I do not remember the school ever staying 
with a beautiful idea long enough to have it become 
part of the children’s lives. 
Now our assembly work was going to be worth 
while. A special teachers’ committee, therefore, 
planned the assembly exercises. Their attention 
was first centred on literature. 
Most of the children came from homes where 
English was spoken either not at all, or very poorly. 
There were a few of English origin. If our chil- 
dren were to grow to love English literature they 
must come upon it in a more vital way than they 
could possibly meet it in classroom work. In the 
classroom there was always a tendency toward gram- 
matical analysis. Even in the treatment of Mother 
Goose there is, in the classroom, the temptation to 
use the stories as a basis for word drills, and little
-P-A-G-E-169
  Our School 163 
else. We wanted appreciation, not symbols, and we 
were going to use the assembly as a means of getting 
this. We wanted to teach literature, on this occa- 
sion at least, so that it would become a permanent 
part of the child’s life, and be carried*home to his 
family, to his younger brothers and sisters. 
We were gathered about the table viewing these 
points pro and con in the usual conservative tone of 
a teachers’ meeting. 
“I'd like to begin with a children’s poet,” I said 
in one of the pauses. 
“Which one?” somebody put in. 
“Longfellow,” suggested the chubby geography 
man. ‘“He’s the easiest. ‘Under the Spreading 
Chestnut Tree.’ ” 
We smiled at his joke and waited for some one 
to make another suggestion. None coming, I said, 
“JT thought about Stevenson. How would he do to 
begin with?” 
“Splendid!” and a wiry little teacher who up 
until now had not uttered a syllable except to vote 
“ay” jumped to her feet. ‘‘ He’s the one for the 
children.” 
For the first time since we’d known her the Scotch 
burr had stuck to her tongue. Snatching up the 
book that lay near her hand she hurried on, a bright 
rose colour appearing on either cheek bone and her 
dark eyes taking fire as she talked excitedly.
-P-A-G-E-170

“ Ah — he’s a r-rare one I tell you. Here’s the 
place we begin: 
Srncinc! 
“ Of speckled eggs the birdie sings 
And nests among the trees; 
The sailor sings of ropes and things 
In ships upon the seas. 
“The children sing in far Japan, 
The children sing in Spain; | 
‘The organ with the organ man | 
Is singing in the rain. | 
“Do you get it? They’re all singing— Chil- 
dren all around the world in one great merry-go- 
round are joining hands and singing — that’s the 
thing for you! 
“ Hark ye to this bit! ‘ Bring the comb and play 
upon it—’ Can’t you just see them stretching out 
their little legs and marching and singing — sing- 
ing! 
“Everywhere he starts them at it— The wind 
and the rain and the sea make music for them and 
away they go, dancing. 
“ And the pictures, they’re wonderful — The wee 
yellow bird on the window sill — The formless wind 
singing in the grass and the treetops — The tiny 
lad marching and singing in the land of pain — 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
Our School 165 
The wistful poetry of childhood— It’s all there 
and so wonderful, wonderful! 
“ Man, we'll clap a glengarry and kilts on this old 
school. We'll stick a twig of heather in her hand 
and she’ll march to Stevenson’s music.” She stopped 
breathless and glowing. 
We chose Stevenson. 
The Stevenson enthusiast never let up. She 
pointed out the best poem for the kindergarten, the 
best one for the 1A’s. She recited one here to prove 
its music, another one in some other room to point 
out the nicety of its phrasing. She found musical 
settings for some and dramatic settings for others. 
She got some fine pictures that illustrated, in colour, 
some of the children’s favourites. So we recited 
and sang and marched to Stevenson’s music until his 
spirit permeated the school. 
On Fridays we had special Stevenson exercises in 
the assembly. We sang selected Stevenson songs, re- 
cited the last learned poems; sometimes several chil- 
dren recited the same one, vieing with each other to 
bring out its special beauties. I asked questions 
about the songs and pictures and poems and about 
the man who wrote them all and the children an- 
swered freely, joyously. At the end of the term all 
the children knew a few of the poems, while some of 
them knew a great many. Some two hundred chil-
-P-A-G-E-172
  166 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
dren owned copies of the ‘Child’s Garden of 
Verses.” 
When we finished with Stevenson we went to Field 
and Riley. 
Then there were the Folk Tales that were handled 
in a similar fashion. Folk Tales, not scattered, but 
in terms of people, Russian, Irish, German, Nor- 
wegian and Indian. | 
These were dramatised and tik songs and dances 
introduced. We gave the children a sympathetic 
appreciation of people and taught them to take home 
these folk stories, tell them to their parents and get 
the parents to tell their own folk tales. So would 
the children be kept close to their parents, giving and 
receiving values that were human. 
The parents came to our Friday morning assem- 
blies, sometimes a few, sometimes a great many, but 
those who came always smiled as they left and car- 
ried the spirit of the school beyond its doors. 
When spring came I thought of the time of carni- _ 
val in Italy, the huge masqued forms reaching to 
the upper windows of the low houses and the chil- 
dren pretending to be scared at their hugeness, run- 
ning in and out from behind doors and corners. It 
was all a game that the men, women and children 
played. Then there were the religious festivals, 
& . 
es 
. 2 
   
-P-A-G-E-173
  Our School 167 
crowds, lights, processions, fireworks, colour, laugh- 
ter; a people at play. 
The school needed a play day. I wanted the 
babies, the mothers, the grandfathers, the friends 
to feel, to think, to take their part in this thing for 
one day and so selected Arbour Day as our festival. 
The school neighbourhgod soon got the habit of 
looking forward to Arbour Day. We knew it was 
coming when a month or mor¢ before the day the 
Dramatic Club began its work of selecting, of put- 
ting together, of changing, of re-arranging the best 
scenes of the term’s work in dramatics. 
We knew Arbour Day had almost come when the 
duly delegated member of the Parents’ Association 
reported that the Park Department had granted us 
twelve trees for Arbour Day, one for each grade. 
We knew Arbour Day was very near when on 
Thursday the trees arrived, and the men came to 
dig the holes, and the school paper came from the 
press and we all went home praying for fair weather. 
We knew it was Arbour Day when on Friday 
* morning we woke early and looked out to find a clear 
sky and a warm sun. We went to school an hour 
ahead of time just because we couldn’t stay at home, 
or because we wanted to make sure that the final 
touch had been given to the building’s decorations. 
Before the doors were opened, there was an army
-P-A-G-E-174
    168 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
of three thousand children, all dressed in their best, 
bright, coloured and gay. With them were their 
mothers, their aunts, their cousins, and the babies in 
the baby carriages. 
Those that could, went to the assembly to see the 
play. Those that had no tickets of admission stayed 
in the streets and in the park waiting for the tree 
planting and the out-door games. 
A child announced the day’s programme. He 
was dressed as a herald and spoke through a trumpet. 
“ Know all ye people that this is our Arbour Day. 
It is a special day of festivities for our school. It 
is our custom each year to plant twelve trees. At 
nine o’clock there will be performed before you the 
play of Robin Hood. At ten o'clock the tree plant- 
ing begins. Each class plants its own tree. At one 
o’clock the school marches to the athletic field to en- 
gage in its sports. This is according to our custom 
so that one day in each year parents, teachers and 
children may live together in the open. This is our 
Arbour Day.” 
Then away we marched to the park. The brown 
uniformed Park men helped us plant the trees and 
when the 1A babies joined hands and sang and ~ 
danced about their tree they beat time with their 
picks and shovels and laughed aloud in sympathy, 
and the big policemen in the background looked at 
one another and said almost wistfully, “‘ We had
-P-A-G-E-175
  
Our School 169 
nothing like this when we went to school. It’s 
great to be a kid these days.” 
Then the games and the dances in the afternoon! 
The hurdy-gurdy men got wind of us and came smil- 
ing and chattering and grinding away and imme- 
diately all the little girls and boys joined hands and 
such a tumbling of little legs and flashing of bright 
coloured ribbons you never saw. 
Beaming mammas and laughing teachers poured 
pennies into the hats and the music and dancing went 
on. The boys played games, and ran races, and 
proudly displayed their medals. 
Then joy of all joys, the hokey, pokey man ar- 
rived: 
“ Hokey-Pokey — com’ along, 
Hokey-Pokey — no last-a-long! 
Penny lump — 
Penny lump.” 
When the long shadows began to darken the grass 
we started home, with tousled hair and floating neck- 
ties, dusty shoes and sticky faces, and the memory 
of a great glad day.

What had become of the problem of school disci- 
pline, the friction that resulted when a teacher tried 
to teach and a child would not learn?

I had begun by punishing children that were re- 
ported, by all the means known to school masters; 
detention, reprimand, lowered standing, suspension 
from work, parents’ assistance, but following the 
child into the street and home had changed the point 
of view. The problem of making the child behave 
had become the problem of providing the best con- 
ditions of growth for him. The school discipline 
had given way to life discipline — and appreciation 
of social values, because the children that needed 
discipline, needed the help of the community, the, 
people, the teachers, the doctors. 
Jacob was a very, very small boy when he first 
came to us. He stayed only a part of the morning 
the first day and did not come back for a year. 
Then he came for two hours more and disappeared 
again. Now Jacob was within the jurisdiction of 
the Compulsory Education Law. He had to attend 
school. Repeatedly therefore when the big man had 
gone out hunting boys, he had returned with this wee 
boy Jacob. In silence they would come through the 
front door, up the stairs, into the office of the pri- 
mary department. 
Then the big man would say, ‘‘ Good morning — 
I have brought in Jacob. He’s small but he won’t 
do anything. He won’t stay home and he won’t go 
to school. He is on parole now. If he does not 
attend we will put him in the truant school.”
-P-A-G-E-177

My assistant would look once more at Jacob, look 
severely, sharply, then in silence take his hand. In 
silence they would go down the hall. Jacob would 
be put in his class with fifty little boys, all sitting very 
stiff and looking at the teacher. 
“Here he is again. Jacob, sit next to Joseph, 
and Joseph, be sure and watch him. See that he 
does not get away,” ordered the teacher. 
The seat was farthest away from the door. But 
somehow when the class least expected it Jacob 
would disappear. Usually he slid to the floor when 
the class was busy and wiggled his way over the well 
oiled surface and out of the room. At nine years of 
age he had been in the truant school. And still when 
the big man went out hunting boys he came back with 
Jacob. 
Then something happened. Jacob discovered a 
teacher he liked. She was teaching the first grade 
and a girls’ class. Jacob was in the second grade, 
thanks to the truant school, but when he discovered 
Miss Katherine, instead of making his way out of 
the building he appeared dishevelled and dusty be- 
side her. : 
“T want to be in your class.” 
“ But,” said the astonished Miss Katherine, “‘ this 
is a girls’ class and a first grade.” 
“* Where will I sit?” asked Jacob. 
Before the teacher could recover herself, Jacob 
   
-P-A-G-E-178
  172 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
had found an empty seat and taken it as if to say, 
“Let the world roll on, I’m happy.” 
The big man had lost his job. No matter how 
often Jacob was placed in his right class he found 
his way to Miss Katherine’s room. 
There was only one thing to do and that was to 
let him stay with her. Miss Katherine understood 
Jacob. He loved growth and the smell of growing 
things. He wanted to handle flowers, dirt, animals, 
and Miss Katherine saw that he got the chance. 
She understood what happened to Jacob on fine 
spring mornings when the roll was called and Jacob 
did not answer. She sent him on trips to his be- 
loved woods and he brought back treasures of the 
outdoors. These he tended. 
When he at last recognised that he had outgrown 
Miss Katherine’s class he took his proper grade 
but reported daily to his first friend. 
We were thankful Miss Katherine belonged to 
our school. While she took care of Jacob, the rest 
of us had grasped a new idea. 
We made a point of assigning the troublesome 
child to a teacher whom he liked. The teacher 
friend kept in touch with him as long as she could be 
useful. Sometimes the child outgrew one advisor 
and was assigned to another. Oftener the relation- 
ship lasted through his school life and beyond it. 
It was this desire to help by getting strong influences
-P-A-G-E-179
  Our School 173 
to continue to be a part of a child’s life that made us 
send the ‘“‘ Flannigans ”’ to the settlement house. 
When a parent came saying, “ Please see that my 
boy behaves. He whips his little brother and throws 
dishes on the floor,” the teacher gave the boy a 
parole card and the parent marked the home be- 
haviour and sent the card in to the teacher. 
Josephine was troublesome. She was in the habit 
of coming in and out of school to suit herself. Her 
mother worked long hours and had no time to train 
Josephine. She did not want the child “ put away.” 
“ There’s a woman near by,” said our school visi- 
tor, ‘‘ who is lonesome for children. All hers have 
grown up and gone away. Let’s ask her and see if 
she will mother Josephine.” 
Accordingly Josephine was transplanted. The 
new “ mother ” taught the child how to live for her- 
self and other people, and sent her back home. 
“T could teach,” the teacher had said, “if some 
one would make them behave.” Now she said, 
“Something is wrong with Jacob.” Instead of 
thinking of Jacob merely as an interference, as a 
challenge to her ability to hold her position, she 
thought of Jacob as a little child crying out for her 
help. “‘ He is mine to make behave,’ was becom- 
ing. ‘‘ He is mine to stand by and strengthen.” 
Sounds of voices in loud protest came from the 
 
-P-A-G-E-180

end of the corridor and I went down to see what 
was wrong. Miss North was trying to talk to Mrs. 
Tavish and Mrs. Tavish was insisting upon doing 
the talking herself. 
“ But can’t you understand me? I’m telling you 
_ I don’t want him to learn. I’d rather he’d be stupid 
than dead,” she shouted. 
“He must learn. Harry must obey the rules of 
the school the same as every other child,” firmly 
enunciated the teacher. “‘He’s got to come to 
school every day and come early. And he’s got to 
learn.” Miss North didn’t say this all at once. She 
said it as she got opportunity between the loud dec- 
lamations of the contrary minded Mrs. Tavish. 
When I appeared there was an instant’s lull and 
the panting teacher said, “‘ I’m so glad you’ve come. 
Perhaps you can make Mrs. Tavish understand.” 
“Understand? It’s me that understands. 
Haven’t I been trying to make you understand the 
thing that’s as plain as the nose on your face for the 
past two months,” and Mrs. Tavish’s pleasant voice 
rose again in good humoured protest. I took her 
to the office and asked her what it was all about. 
“Tt’s about my Harry. Now I’m not standing 
up for Harry — and I’m not blaming him either — 
nor the teacher — for there’s them you can do with, 
and them you can’t. It’s the same with teachers as 
with children, you'll find.”
-P-A-G-E-181
  Our School 175 
“* What did you want the teacher to do?” I quer- 
ied. 
“ Just to leave the child alone. But she won't. 
She says she can’t. I’m the mother of eleven, all 
alive and well, thank God, and Harry’s the last, and 
if I must say it, he’s a bit thick. As good a boy as 
ever stepped, but thick about his lessons. 
“Well, sir, whatever got into that teacher two 
months ago she began fighting the child to learn his 
lessons. The more she kept at him the more she 
might, till she says, ‘ You'll have to stay in every 
night until you do every bit of your work.’ True to 
her word, didn’t she keep him every day till five and 
after? 
“T didn’t tell you that once Harry had the fits. 
He doesn’t be troubled with them much unless his 
food goes wrong or something bothers him, but this 
steady driving brought them on. He’d come home 
from school and fall asleep at the table, then in the 
night he’d have a fit. The next morning he couldn’t 
get up. He was allin. When he got ready I gave 
him his breakfast and started him to school. To be 
sure he was late but I thought ‘ Better late than not 
at all.’ 
“ All this time I kept writing her notes and asking 
her to excuse Harry until one day she said, ‘ Bring me 
no more excuses. You must learn your lessons and 
you’ve got to come early every day.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  176 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
“She kept right on trying to make him learn 
and keeping him in every day until Harry came home 
and said, ‘I won't go back to that teacher any more.’ 
Neither would he. I had to pull him out of bed 
and push him to the school door. I told her about it 
but, ‘ No, he must come and he must learn,’ says she. 
“On your head be it,’ says I and I just let the 
child sleep in the morning. 
“And what next does she do, d’ye think?” and 
here Mrs. Tavish leaned over very confidentially 
and marked each word with her forefinger on the 
arm of her chair. 
““She comes every morning before eight o’clock 
and she pushes my bell and says she, ‘Is Harry 
ready? I'll take him with me,’ till I’m so wrought 
up I hear that bell every morning before she gets on 
the block. Nothing I say takes effect on her. She 
just dunners and dunners away at the boy until he'll 
lose the bit of sense he has. She’s got to stop it. 
Now am I right or am I wrong?” and she leaned 
back in her chair with the patient air of one sorely 
tried. 
“T think you’re right. We'll have to let Harry 
alone.” 
“Good for you. I’m not blaming you for the 
teacher, I said and I say again, there’s them you can 
do with and them you can’t. And you must not 
blame me for Harry. Some we make priests, some

we make stone masons and some we leave as God 
made them. That’s Harry ’—and she shook my 
hand heartily and went home. 
I went back to the teacher and told her about the 
boy. 
“Oh, I’m sorry. It’s all my own fault. If I’d 
only listened. But I was so sure he was just lazy 
and I was trying so hard to cure him. Do you think 
I’ve hurt him much? Can’t we put him in the 
Special?” 
“ That’s the place for him,” I agreed. 
The Special was a very large, bright room. The 
children were selected for different reasons. Some 
were too fast and some were too slow for the meas- 
ured work of the classroom. Some were unfitted 
by temperament or nerves for the pressure of the big 
group; each of them was an individual that for some 
reason or other could not go forward with the mass. 
The equipment of the room was selected with the 
idea of liberty of action for individuals and groups. 
There were a few benches screwed in orderly lines 
to the floors; but scattered about the room were 
tables and chairs where children might group them- 
selves for work. At one end a long rack of tools, 
lumber, and twists of reed and raffia, stood ready for 
work. A sewing machine occupied one corner and a 
book case another. Pictures there were in plenty, 
with here and there a cast or a plant.
-P-A-G-E-184
    178 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
The teacher was a fine strong man who wanted 
to understand and help children. He could play 
ball, tell a story, tie up a sore finger, give an arith- 
metic lesson, with equal enthusiasm and apprecia- 
tion; and he never lost his poise, not even when I 
sent him the “ Five.” 
“The Five” were sturdy youngsters from the 
fourth and fifth years, a monitor-teasing, pedlar- 
baiting, neighbourhood-disturbing group — strong 
on ball games and street fights; the joy of the small 
boy and the bane of the teachers’ lives. About the 
middle: of the term their teachers discovered that 
they were going to be left back at the term-end un- 
less some radical change took place. I sent the 
“ Five” to the Special. 
By-and-by I went in to see how they were doing. 
The teacher was busy teaching a group to add frac- 
tions; the remaining groups were disposed about the 
room. “ The Five” were around a big table very 
busy. ‘“‘ Corduroys ’ was in command as of right and 
usage. ‘‘ Put away the pads and take your readers,” 
he ordered. ‘‘ Now ‘Specks,’ begin. Go slow. 
The words I don’t get will be counted a miss.” “ But I oo soe 
“ Begin, or you'll lose one for the argument.” 
They read around the table until the lesson was 
completed. Once they stopped to have an “ argu- 
ment.”
-P-A-G-E-185
  Our School 179 
“ That sur-round the island,” read “‘ Beef.” 
“That's wrong. It’s sur-round —’’ corrected 
Corduroys. 
“*Tis not. A minute ago you said sur-face, now 
you say sur-round. If it’s sur-face then it’s sur- 
round,” Beef grinned in triumph. 
For an instant Corduroys was held, then his face 
lighted. 
“Get the Dictionary, Specks.” 
“No, you don’t. I don’t know the Dictionary. 
You ask teacher when it’s our turn with him to-day. 
What he says I stand for.” 
“ How are they getting on?” I asked the teacher. 
“Great. I wouldn’t ask any better. They take 
turns in teaching but they generally fall back to Cor- 
duroys. They'll more than make their grade. I 
wish you’d have Specks’ eyes looked at though. I 
think his glasses are not right. He gets very irri- 
table after he uses his eyes for a time.” 
In the Ungraded Room were the children of de- 
fective minds. At one time these were our disci- 
plinary cases: now they were our wards, to be studied 
and given every opportunity for growth. 
One big overgrown boy had in the first months 
given us a great deal of trouble. As usual we ap- 
pealed to his parents but they could do nothing 
for us. Morris was worse at home than he was at 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
foe 
180 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
school. School time came as a blessed relief to his | 
mother. Then he was examined and put in the Un- | 
graded class. Soon I missed him from the complaint 
list and went to see what he was doing that kept him 
out of mischief. 
When I entered his room he was busy with a pile 
of stiff white paper, a brush, a pot of paint and a 
stencil set. He leaned a card against the blackboard 
to dry. It read, ‘9 eggs 25 cents.” ‘“‘ Teacher,” 
he called out, ‘‘ how do you spell bread?” Slowly 
the teacher spelled over the heads of three little girls 
she was helping thread big needles — b-r-e-a-d. 
With his tongue curling around the corners of his 
mouth, fingers tightly knotted about a very thick, 
bright, yellow pencil, Morris printed each letter on a 
slip of paper. Then assuming a very important, 
bustling air he began painting a card for “‘ bread.” 
“ What is it?” I whispered to the teacher. 
“ He’s crazy to work in a grocery store,” she an- 
swered. ‘He has a job for the afternoons. I’ve 
made the grocery shop the centre of his work and it’s 
surprising’ how he’s getting on. He works his arith- 
metic on the grocery slips. He tries to read any- 
thing that has to do with the grocery business so I’m 
making a reader for him out of cuttings in this blank 
book,” and the teacher pulled a long strand of raffia 
through a big needle. ‘‘ He’s just what you see him 
now all the time. For a day or so he was sulky and  
-P-A-G-E-187
  Our School 181 
ugly but I saw him with the grocery slips and talked 
to him about them and he’s been going ahead on that 
line ever since.” Another strand was drawn through 
another big needle. 
“Lucy's at her loom, you see. Usually she 
threads these needles for the little ones but I don’t 
want to bother her to-day. She has one of her fussy 
spells. When she’s like that she can’t do a thing 
with her academic work but she works beautifully at 
her loom. It’s strange but it seems to soothe and 
rest her. She’ll work at it maybe all morning — 
then go to her table and do her lessons very nicely. 
We have an order for the rug she’s making and that’s 
a great help. When her mother found that the work 
had money value she wasn’t so much worried about 
Lucy’s spending time on it and stopped scolding her. 
She even sent us some rags for the rug. So that’s 
settled. 
“T am going to take Morris to the garden. He 
needs more physical work. I can tie it up to-the 
grocery store and once he gets started he will like it 
well enough to go on.” 
As I turned to leave the room the teacher said, 
“Tt’s story time. I wish you had time to tell us a 
story.” 
“Of course I have. I know a fine one.” 
Like magic the work disappeared into drawers and 
closets. Morris ran to the corner of the room where
-P-A-G-E-188
  182 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
a long roll leaned, swung it up the centre of the room 
and rolled it out, ‘‘ the magic carpet.” Every child 
sat down upon it and the story began. 
I knew when I went away that the older ones 
would go on with their bench work and the littlest 
ones build a story of blocks on the Magic Rug. By 
and by the teacher would play softly on the piano and 
the little ones would sleep while the older ones went 
down to the gymnasium. 
We had difficulty with the little foreigners who 
found their way to the school. It is so hard not to 
be able to make oneself understood, especially when 
one is little. 
“Plis. I make finger, she no let foot.” This 
from a tearful boy brought to me by a vexed teacher. 
The vexation vanished in a peal of laughter. 
“ Really,” she gasped, “‘I can’t do anything with 
him. He means he raised his hand and I wouldn’t 
let him go out of the room. He doesn’t know a 
word I say, and I don’t understand him a bit. Just 
now I thought by his motions that he wanted to 
change his seat. I wouldn’t let him and he ran out 
of the room. He didn’t come back and I went to 
look for him and I found him standing in the hall 
weeping. I know now he was asking to leave the 
room but next time he’ll try it a different way because 
I didn’t understand this time, and I'll get it wrong
-P-A-G-E-189
  
Our School 183 
again. Seriously, I’m wasting time though. I have 
to stop for him so many times and the class must wait 
for me and lose part of each lesson.” 
We asked for the “‘C” or the Foreign Class for 
all such children. We had about thirty. The 
teacher assigned to the foreigners was an older 
teacher, one who had been a foreigner as I had been. 
Together we planned for these children. We com- 
pared notes and resolved that our difficulties should 
not be theirs. There should be plenty of toys, pic- 
tures, maps, stories, dramatics, games, action and 
colour and music. And there should be no diffi- 
culty or misunderstanding about leaving the room. 
There was an ornamental balcony open to the sky 
and facing the park. The Board turned it into a 
room for us and here we put the anemic children. 
At first they didn’t like it. They wanted to do 
just what the other children did. But the teacher 
was “ lovely ”— they couldn’t help loving her. She 
had rosy cheeks and shiny eyes and little wisps of 
curls that danced about and when she said, “I’m so 
glad you came,” they couldn’t help being glad of it 
themselves. 
Then there were crackers and milk. A mother 
came in to serve it and the teacher said, “I’m so 
glad you came,” and instantly there was a proud son 
of his mother helping give out the mugs and another  
-P-A-G-E-190
184 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
one vowing inwardly that it should be his turn an- 
other day. 
But the best was to come. Long chairs were 
drawn out and each child wrapped in a blanket lay 
very, very quiet, wondering what was to happen 
next. Teacher sat where everybody could see and 
hear and began to tell a story of creeping, creeping 
bunnies who were sleeping, sleeping, sleeping, and no 
one ever knew what happened to those bunnies for 
no matter how many times the story started it never 
got past the sleeping, sleeping part. 
The children grew taller and heavier and rosier. 
The place of honour was accorded the pupil who 
had gained the greatest number of pounds during 
the week and the race was close. 
At the end of the term we found their academic 
work was ahead of that of their former classmates. 
Some of these children who in their weakness had 
been a serious drag upon the classroom had done 
more than a term’s work in the open air. 
Time and again we found that the children with 
whom we failed, the bad children, were physically or 
mentally unprepared. They had adenoids or bad 
teeth or poor digestion or sluggish livers; their eyes 
were weak or their ears were dull; their nervous re- 
actions were slowed up or over stimulated. They 
were in no condition to be taught what we wanted to 
teach them.
-P-A-G-E-191
  Our School 185 
We had first examined and regrouped the most 
striking cases of failure. These proved to be the 
physically and mentally retarded children. Still 
we failed with a group in each class. We couldn’t 
get the whole fifty to measure up. We called in the 
specialists and they examined and regrouped the 
stragglers. ‘Those who showed eye defects had 
glasses fitted and these were tested monthly for a 
year. 
The Speech Defects were searched out, classified 
and drilled daily by a speech expert. 
So we struggled on. Every time a teacher re- 
ported a child as falling below the class standard, we 
examined and classified him anew with the idea that 
it was his duty to reach that standard and ours to 
help him to it. We did this in the spirit of service. 
We must help him to realise himself and our only 
medium was the Course of Study, the seat, the book, 
the teacher. 
Out of the seeming confusion of the great school’s 
activities— the children playing, studying, shout- 
ing; teachers chatting, gravely conferring with 
fathers and mothers, visiting, teaching, presiding at 
parents’ meetings; fathers and mothers coming and 
going, praising, criticising, helping,— emerged the 
great idea of our school — Service. 
Service based upon the appreciation of the best 
that was in all of us — parents and children, principal
-P-A-G-E-192
  186 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
and teachers. The slow realisation that we were, 
all of us, “ just folks,” struggling under the limita- 
tions of humanity, was teaching us toleration and 
generosity and sympathy for each other. If our 
bones ached with the toil of the day we no longer 
nursed them in isolation. We talked over the day’s 
happenings, laughed at the funny ones and stored the 
other's away as experience. 
I met the Assistant Principal. She was .coming 
from a visit to the regular classrooms studying the 
records she had made in her note book. She looked 
up as I neared her with a worry line between her 
eyes. 
“ What is it?” I asked. 
“ T’ve examined and classified and followed up the 
individual child and yet I go to the classroom and find 
the group that can’t ‘make it.’ There’s something 
missing in the classrooms.” She snapped the rubber 
band on her note book and the worry line grew 
deeper. ‘‘ Do you know, I feel like the old woman in 
children’s story. ‘ And still she sat — and still she 
spun and still she sighed for — company.’ Does one 
have to be feebleminded or crippled or bad before 
he gets a chance to do things? All we have is 
pencils and paper and text books. No tools, no gar- 
den — fifty to a class, ‘ nothing doing’ for vs normal 
citizens. We just sit and spin. 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
    
Our School 187 
“ You’ve tried to remove every obstacle in the way 
of the children’s progress, yet we seem to get no fur- 
ther ahead. We aren’t alive. Do you realise that 
the little children may talk aloud about half a min- 
ute every two hours? That’s about all we can allow 
them. When are they going to learn to talk Eng- 
lish? They move about only at the teacher’s com- 
mand and they soon learn to wait for it and when they 
reach the upper grades they have no self direction 
whatever. 
“We're not to blame. It’s the size of our classes. 
Fifty to a teacher and two classes ina room. We’re 
simply turning out more candidates for Specials in- 
stead of making the Specials useless. I’m disheart- 
ened,” and she turned wearily toward the office. 
“Yes,” I said to myself, ‘‘ that’s as far as we’ve 
got. Picking up those that fall, and doing nothing 
to keep them from falling.” 
Il 
Six years passed. The school that once held a 
little more than two thousand children had grown 
again to almost four thousand. As more children 
came the classes had to double up in the use of class- 
rooms. 
Soon there was little place and little time for the 
afternoon activities. The classroom time now re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-194

188 4 Schoolmaster of the Great City 
duced from five to four hours was all too short to 
accomplish the curriculum work. One group of 
children came from 8 :30 to 10:30 and from 12:30 to 
2:30 — another group came from 10:30 to 12:30 
and from 2:30 to 4:30. Five times a day the gong 
rang — I heard its resonance from floor to floor, call- 
ing, calling to the children to move. Five times a 
day I heard the measured rhythm of many, many feet. 
I saw the surge of sound, and colour and motion, chil- 
dren going in, children going out, eyes front, hats 
off, tramp, tramp, tramp and then silence. 
All the rooms in the building except those used by 
the special children had to be given up all day long 
to learning the three R’s. There was no spot where 
the child in the regular grades could turn for free- 
dom. The biggest part of the Assembly work had 
to be omitted, because the rooms, cut off by rolling 
doors, had to be used for teaching the rudiments of 
learning. The registers in each of these normal 
classes was full to the seating capacity — fifty to a 
teacher. Those in the Specials were kept down to 
thirty. | 
“There's a group in the fifth grade that must be 
|   
scattered,” said my assistant. ‘I don’t understand 
it but every once in a while that happens. A group 
of difficult cases get into one class and what one over- 
looks the other remembers. We might scatter them 
through the classes — put some in morning time and
-P-A-G-E-195
Our School 189 
some in the afternoon so that they'll be separated, 
and if that can’t be done they should be assigned to a 
strong teacher next term. Even with all our sorting 
we get one of these classes now and then that will not 
learn. I am afraid thirty per cent. of this class will 
have to be left back. But even at that we'll promote 
ninety per cent. of the school. Pretty good, don’t 
you think?” 
“Very good indeed. How did it happen?” 
She looked a bit astonished. ‘‘ Why we've 
worked like dogs to get it. I hoped for more but we 
can’t seem to make it. Do what you will there’s 
always a group of holdovers. The teacher has too 
many children, too little time and always a fear that 
she won’t finish the term’s work; that we will find 
fault, that the superintendent won’t be pleased, or 
that her class will not be up to the standard of the 
other classes.” 
As she started to leave the office I said, “I’m 
tremendously interested in the ninety per cent. we are 
going to promote. Do you feel that they’ve learned? 
Are they really taking in what we are teaching 
them?” 
The assistant laughed. “ You are always look- 
ing behind the scenes.” 
“Sometimes I’ve been afraid that the real thing 
wasn’t there even when the children answered with 
seeming intelligence.”
-P-A-G-E-196

The next day I went into a first grade class. It 
happened that my assistant was there looking on. 
The class was just about to begin the reading lesson. 
At a signal from the teacher seven little fellows 
sprang up and distributed the readers to their rows. 
“Open to lesson six. It has a big six at the top 
and the duck picture,”’ said the teacher. ‘“ Ready? 
First row, begin! ” | 
The first row sprang up in a flash. Each child 
read one sentence. Sometimes it meant five words, 
sometimes eleven, rarely more. Row after row in 
quick succession read. No child hesitated: no child 
made a mistake until the last row was reached. 
“ The holdovers,” whispered the assistant. 
These children read slowly, pointing at each word 
and sometimes miscalling one. 
I knew what was in the assistant’s mind when she 
went to the board and printed a jingle using only 
words that had occurred in the reading lesson. 
The dog, the fox, the cat, 
One day,

‘“* Who can read my story?” she said. 
A troubled silence followed. 
“T make a different g,” whispered the teacher. 
“ Fix it up if you think that will help?” said the 
assistant. 
Still nobody volunteered to read the story. 
“Think, children,” urged the teacher. ‘‘ You 
know those words.” 
Still sorrowful silence. 
Again the teacher went to the rescue. 
“What is this word?” laying a pointer tip on 
“ dog.” 
“ Dog,” came the answer. 
“Certainly. Now what’s this one?” 
“ Fox! ” 
“To be sure. Now this one.” 
“oc Cat.” 
“Now read the first story.” 
“The dog, the fox, the cat —” 
“See, they know it. But they want to do it my 
way.” 
“ Ask a child to read the line about the duck,” 
said the assistant. 
The teacher called a bright looking child to read. 
“ Study it, William.” 
She pointed to each word along the line and the 
little boy nodded vigorously toward her as he fol- 
lowed the pointer tip with his eyes and lips.  
-P-A-G-E-198
    ! 
192 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
William pointed at each word with a little stab- 
bing motion and jerked his body forward and back 
as he recognised each word and went on to the next. 
With a final stab at the period he straightened to at- 
tention and read — 
“ But the duck said, ‘ Quack, quack!’ ” 
“The last word, William, look again,” and the 
pointer tip guided his eyes to the right place. 
William looked, first at the word and then at the 
teacher — then again at the word and read, not so 
confidently. 
“ But the duck said, ‘ quack, quack!’ ” 
“ Hands, children. What is that word?” 
Several hands came up and one boy said, ‘ Luck, 
luck.” 
“Why, William, I’m surprised. You should 
have known that.” 
“T know it,” said William, ‘‘ but the duck always 
said ‘ quack, quack,’ before.” 
As we went out I said, “‘ Do you really feel they 
are ninety per cent. efficient?” 
It was the children’s own vocabulary. They 
were familiar with the animals in the story. It was 
grouped into short phrases. It had the familiar 
phonic elements. It was a jingle. It told a story, 
yet the children couldn’t read it. The teacher had 
to show the way for each step. Without her they
-P-A-G-E-199

were helpless. The duck must always say ‘‘ quack, 
quack.” 
“T’ve tried that same thing a half dozen times 
this term, but I get nowhere,” said the assistant 
wearily. “ The teacher says, ‘I am coming up for 
a seventh year increase of salary. The superintend- 
ent only asks what is in the book. With fifty chil- 
dren in this room it’s all I can do to get the children 
to learn the grade words and the sentences in the 
book.’ 
“And after all aren’t we teachers just that way? 
Haven’t we been taught to be afraid from the very 
first day we came to the Kindergarten class and the 
teachers said, ‘On your toes. Not a sound,’ as we 
passed the principal’s office? Haven’t we been 
trained to give perfect results? Haven’t we been 
trained to fear making a mistake, to fear the respon- 
sibility of working out our own ideas? This is a 
school world and we always say ‘ quack, quack,’ be- 
cause we have said it before, and it was right.” 
As promotion time drew nearer I thought more 
and more about these children who were to be pro- 
moted or left back. We had taken out of the regu- 
lar grades the children that were weak, so that the 
others could progress and yet the average child was 
not doing work that made him independent of the 
teacher. 
 
-P-A-G-E-200

IV: 
I lived only a short distance from the school. I 
had settled in the neighbourhood to get the feel of 
the school in a rather intimate way. Looking out 
of my window morning or evening I could see the 
school building towering over the trees. It was only 
a short walk through the park and all the many 
hours I would otherwise have spent in travel were 
saved for the school. It was so convenient being 
near the school. A neighbour could drop in any 
time. A teacher now and then might stop in on his 
way home. A child or a group of them was sure 
to appear on a holiday. It was not so difficult to go 
out of an evening and meet some of the people and 
talk over the needs of the children. 
We never grew tired of talking about the needs of 
the children. We said the same things over and 
over again and the oftener we said them the more 
we believed we were right. 
I do not know how many times we talked over 
better opportunities for the children, more vital 
things to do in school, or Parents’ Associations. 
Somewhere in the course of the conversation some 
one was sure to explode. He would become 
wrought up at the slow progress of things, at the 
apparent indifference of school officials, and we 
would listen and laugh and plan the next move.
-P-A-G-E-201
  Our School 195 
The walk across the park gave me a good start 
each day, and brought me back refreshed at night. 
I watched the seasons coming and going in their 
slow, calm, measured way. The trees would bud, 
flower, fruit, and sleep again. Progress here had 
its own measured steps and when I became impatient 
at school progress the trees would speak to me and © 
I would smile and go on again. Many times as I 
walked among them I would catch the smile and the 
nod of a stranger who thought my smile was in- 
tended for him. 
Sometimes I would run over in my mind the 
things we had done to make the child’s lot better. 
There were the clubs and the music classes at the set- 
tlement house, the children’s departments at the dis- 
pensary, the garden, the playground, the dramatics, 
the poets, the music, the tree planting, the special 
classes, the speech training, the school visitor, the 
parents helping in the school, the big, human friend- 
liness of the whole mass, children, teachers, and par- 
ents. 
Then my mind unfailingly went to the classroom 
and the class teacher and I tried to figure out what 
was happening there to make for freedom and cour- 
age. “It isn’t what you teach the children that 
counts,” the old principal who loved school children 
had told me. ‘“ They forget most of the knowledge 
given them. What they need is the habit of free { 
| | A x \

thinking and the spirit of work.’ How much 
thought was there in the classroom? How much 
independent work? 
Nowhere did the children, save those of the handi- 
capped classes, learn by personal experiences, nor 
did they act i endently. The classrooms had not 
- been bu ilt to | permit a Trevclasses + ore” 
_ efowded. The children had to move in clas. s 
and exactly on time. The clamour of the gong was 
insistent. How rude and how frequent were its in- 
terruptions. I felt the hurry to get the facts into the 
children’s heads. I felt the tension in the child’s 
body as he bent to the routine. I saw the teachers 
standing over all, talking, measuring, urging. 
Here was “ Our School” still in the grip of tradi- 
tion, rules, records, and endless routine. ‘‘ My 
School” was still a dream school. 
But growth is a slow affair. | At least, or at 
best, perhaps I should say, we teachers had touched 
the people. We had carried the school out of its 
four walls and the school had been touched by the 
breath of reality, humanity. Socialising the school 
had humanised it. |

CHAPTER VII 
THE DIRECTION OF THE NEW START 
I 
THE schools will change for the better when their 
life is made basically different from what it has been. 
They are pointed in the direction of the funda- 
mentals of knowledge but working with the tools of 
the classicists. They have developed and devel- 
oped until we find life on one side, that is outside the 
school, and learning on the other side, that is inside 
the school. Now the schools must be pointed so 
that life and the school become one. 
To begin with, better school conditions must be 
provided for the youngest children. The first steps 
in child teaching must be sound. The primary years 
of school must be worth while. Unless the basic 
structure is real, soul satisfying, higher education will 
be halting and futile. The child is entitled to a fine 
start in his life’s journey if he is to have a fair chance 
of carrying his head high and his shoulders straight. 
He comes to school a distinct personality. He 
is joyous, spontaneous, natural, free— But from 
197
-P-A-G-E-204
    198 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
the first day, instead of watching, encouraging that 
personality, the school begins to suppress it and keeps 
up the process year in and year out. By and by 
we begin to search for the individuality that has been 
submerged. We make tempting offers to the stu- 
dent in the high school and in the college — we give 
him better teachers, better equipment, greater free- 
dom, more leisure, smaller classes, direct experiences. 
We call upon him to stand out, to face the problems 
of life honestly, squarely; to be himself. How blind 
we are! First we kill and then we weep for that 
which we have slain. 
We do not look upon the children as an important 
economic factor. Children are a problem to the 
parent and teacher but not to the race. 
Do you raise pigs? The government is almost 
tearful in its solicitude for their health and welfare. 
The Agricultural Bureau sends you scientific data 
gathered at great pains and expense. But do you 
raise children? Ah. They are very expensive. 
And there are so many of them! One teacher to 
fifty is the best we can do for you. Teachers who 
are specialists in their profession? Oh, now really! 
You know we could never afford that. We must pay 
for high-priced teachers for the high schools and 
upper grades but for the little children —all you 
want is a pleasant personality that is able to teach the 
rudiments of learning. There’s not much to do in
-P-A-G-E-205
  The Direction of the New Start 199 
those grades—just the rudiments, you know. 
There’s no disciplining to do there, the children are 
so easily suppressed. It’s only in the upper grades 
we have the trouble! : 
Stupid and topsy-turvy ! 
We need the scientist, the child specialist, the art- 
ist in the first year of school. We need few children 
to a teacher and plenty of space to move about in. 
It’s there the teacher should eagerly, anxiously, 
reverently, watch for the little spark of genius, of 
soul, of individuality, and so breathe the breath of 
life upon it that it can never again be crushed or re- 
pressed. 
J We must spend more money on elementary educa- 
/ tion if the money we now spend on higher education 
i to bring forth results that are commensurate with 
our national needs. We spend fifty dollars.a year 
on the education of a child and ten times that amount 
on the education of a young college man. 
We must keep the three R’s, but they must change 
with the changing social needs. They must keep 
pace with the world, and in fact a little ahead of the 
practical world so that they will be dynamic. Con- 
stantly they must be in touch with the strong life cur- 
rents about the child, the factory, the mill, the shop, 
the market, the store, the garden, the home. 
The school must be enriched so that the child can 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  200 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
| experiment with actual things from the very first 
day he comes to school. Play rooms and games, ani- 
mals and plants, wood and nails must take their place 
side by side with books and words. 
Be it remembered, however, that a shop, a studio, 
a play-room, may become as formal, as dead, as anti- 
quated, as rigid as any phase of the present book 
school, if these activities are developed by rule and 
applied to all children regardless of tastes or tend- 
encies, in accordance with a fixed time schedule that 
has neither elbow room nor leisure. 
Just as we have failed to throw out the useless in 
the book study so we may fail to throw out the use- 
less in the new things to come, if we centre attention 
on them rather than on the child. 
The school must constantly ask, “‘ What is the ef- 
fect of my programme on the soul growth of the chil- 
dren? Why is it that my programme does not reach 
all children? What can I do to keep in touch with 
ideas that are vigorous and young? What can I do 
to keep sane, human, far-seeing? How can I re- 
spect the child’s prolonged infancy and keep him 
from facing the struggle of the labour market until 
he is mentally and physically fit? How can I trans- 
late efficiency, goodness, will training, citizenship, 
parental duty into child happiness? ” 
The child is the permanent factor. The expres- 
sion of himself for the common good is his purpose in 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
  The Direction of the New Start 201 
life. Service that is in harmony with the best in- 
stincts of his soul is the child’s mission in life. Serv- 
ice always carries with it some one else. Talking, 
co-operation, fun, openness, are part of its very be- 
ing. It grows with the spirit of the crowd from 
which it derives hope, life, strength, emotion. 
I call this expression of self for the common good 
the art instinct of the child and I say that art puts the 
soul into everything the child does, whether he sweeps 
a floor, washes a wall, draws a picture, writes a poem, 
sings a song. The things he makes, the poems he 
reads, the compositions he writes, the games he plays, 
the clay he moulds, all these need the force of an 
idea that is inspiring because it has the forward pull 
of this social art. 
To take the child out of the narrowness of the 
printed page and put his energy back into the narrow- 
ness of the furrow of the plough will not make for 
complete living. The substitution of direct expe- 
riences for indirect ones leads nowhere. Both are 
needed, work and analysis of work, study and the 
application of study and through it all, sincere artis- 
tic expression in answer to the needs of each indi- 
vidual soul. 
Change the school so its life is continuous. 
Change the school so that the child may grow by in- 
timate contact with older children and the teachers, 
the ones who carry the responsibility. Change the 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
202 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
school so that each child is individualised and not 
merged, so that the child has leisure to grow and a 
desire to grow in the right direction. : 
Change the school so that it will permit the chil- 
dren to act for themselves and less by rule, so that 
it is not the teacher who shows the way but the child, 
and the teacher follows his lead. 
Change the school so that the external, imposed 
dogmatism of school discipline gives place to real 
discipline, morally strong, self-made, independent. 
We are now at the beginning of newer and richer 
educational possibilities. Have we the courage to 
think of the youngest child first, and this time begin 
our changes, not in the college, the high school, the 
upper grades, but in the first six years of school? 
/Have we the courage to offer these children oppor- 
{ tunities for joyous, expressive work? Have we the 
courage to change our class education into democratic 
\ education? 
II 
The first thing to do then is to change the kind of 
“school, making it rich, making it live. The second 
thing to do is to train the teacher differently. 
If the conditions of school life are such that they 
warp the child’s mental powers, then these same con- 
ditions warp the teacher’s mental powers. If the
-P-A-G-E-209
  The Direction of the New Start 203 
school means arrested development for the child it 
means arrested development for the teacher. 
What briefly is the history of the teacher’s train- 
ing? 
At six she goes into a first year grade to begin 
the serious task of preparing for life. She may be 
too weak physically, or too immature mentally to 
start the routine of regular classroom work but she 
is six and that’s the age to begin. 
For eight years the child who is to be a teacher 
sits and memorises and recites, receives good marks 
and is promoted. Her ability to recite the allotted 
lessons, though no test of spiritual growth, of human 
sympathy, are sufficient for school progress. 
Now the child that is to be a teacher is sent to 
high school. The same grind continues, the same 
standards are practised. She sits, memorises, re- 
ceives good marks and is promoted. 
From the first day she began as a child in the baby 
class the teacher learned to be silent. She learned 
to be impressed. She learned to yield to force. She 
got into the habit of relying on the mind of another, 
of believing in books and words rather than in 
actions. She got into the habit of being afraid to 
think, to act, she merely followed. 
“Come, quick— eleven times twelve — think 
now, why don’t you think! ” said one teacher. 
But what was the child to think about as she stood 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  204 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
dejectedly at her seat, a harried look inher eye? As 
the teacher passed on to the next girl, the child said, 
“T must think, I must think — next time I’ll know.” 
The class went to the gymnasium. In one corner 
were the wands to be used in the day’s drill. At once 
she remembered, ‘‘ I must think.’ She left the line 
and was about to take down the wands from the rack 
when the teacher saw her. Snap went the teacher’s 
thumb and finger and her voice followed after: 
“Come here. What are you doing there without 
permission? ” 
“Why, I thought —” the child began timidly. 
“You thought! What right had you to think? 
T’ll do the thinking for this class. Take your place. 
We'll have no more interruption from you.” ~ 
And this was part of the teacher’s training. 
Next the child that is to be a teacher goes to train- 
ing school. By this time she is almost a machine. 
She knows what to do. She continues to sit, to study 
books, to make recitations, to receive per cent. 
ratings, to be promoted. By and by this child that is 
to be a teacher is examined, placed upon an eligible 
list, and appointed to teach. 
The child that is now a teacher enters the class- 
room, the history of her training fresh in her mind. 
She begins to teach the children in the way that she 
has learned. The supervisor enters her room and
-P-A-G-E-211
  The Direction of the New Start 205 
because of the children’s ability to reproduce the facts 
of the curriculum says, ‘‘ Well done,” and rates the 
teacher. The training is nearly complete. 
Later on the teacher decides to go back to the Uni- 
versity so as to obtain promotion, so that she herself 
may become a supervisor. When she enters the 
University what is done for her? At once she is put 
into a seat, and handedabook. The professor talks, 
talks, talks. She writes, writes, writes. Words, 
words, words! Examinations come and she returns 
these words to him. She is marked, rated and 
passed. Now and then there is an exception. The 
teacher gets a new point of view. She goes back to 
the classroom. But before long the continuous 
monotony of teaching the same thing in the same way, 
at the same time, with the same results has its effect 
and she succumbs, dies spiritually, intellectually! — 
Now the training is quite complete. 
How can the training be changed so that a new 
type of teacher may be evolved? 
Is there any change that can be made in the ele- 
mentary school itself? Is it possible to vitalise the 
school so that the child who is to be a teacher may 
from the beginning learn from contact with more 
vital experience than mere school book-learning af- 
fords? 
If the older children are trained to assist in teach- 
ing the younger ones, helping in the classrooms with
-P-A-G-E-212
  206 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
the lessons, or leading the games in the yards, then 
even at the age when they enter the high school they 
know in a dim way whether teaching is the right 
“calling” for them. 
Can the higher training include the direction of 
young children in club life, the participation in the 
work of settlements, the study of the home and street 
life? 
Should the training schoo] period include work in 
the hospital for children, so that the teacher may 
actually learn what the physical needs of the chil- 
dren are, and where to go for help? 
Should practice work be preparation for more in- 
tensive study in the training school and not the finish- 
ing touch? Should the student take back to the train- 
ing school, studies of individual children, their eco- 
nomic conditions, their history, their physical condi- 
tion, their tendencies, and the attempts she has made 
to solve the problems they presented? 
Is it right to say that a knowledge of subject mat- 
ter and ways of presenting it are only a minor part 
of the teacher’s training? What controls methods 
of teaching? Subject matter or children? 
The teacher must be trained in this larger way 
because the burden of making a better school rests on 
her. She has been massed, she must cease to be num- 
Bers and be ONE. 
\ LO Teacher, find your inspiration in your work! Pa 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  The Direction of the New Start 207 
Find work that will keep you mentally fresh. - You, 
above all, have need of work that will make you 
grow, and what you do for the sake of the children 
is the only work that gives you life. With neigh- 
bours, fathers, mothers, with children, good and bad, 
you must cast your lot and as a leader plan the future 
ofthe race. Do not go to books. There is more 
philosophy — big, broad, human philosephy in the 
simple folk lore of some of the poorest and most dis- 
tressed people than there is in most of the books that 
you read. It is only when you keep in constant 
touch with humanity that you see the child, more im- 
portant than the curriculum, than the school, than the 
per cents., than promotions. , 
To know the child, to work so that he may grow, \ 
is a far bigger thing than anything else in the world. 
You sometimes refuse to have anything to do with 
the child that presents a problem. You cast him off, 
because you are school-trained, not life-trained. 
You put the problem up to somebody else. When 
you do that you are lost. This is your problem. 
Only touch with life conditions can help solve it. 
Like the child, you have been so long in bondage, 
dominated, that you have lost your strength, you are 
fearful, you sometimes lack the courage of your con- 
victions. 
But there is nothing to fear. 
Speak freely, experiment boldly. You are a

greater artist than he who paints a picture, than he 
who carves a statue, than he who writes a book. 
Your product is that wonderful thing, human con- 
\duct! You are a creator! America looks to you 
Yor her greatness, her united voice, her bigness of 
race! 
Ii 
First we must change the life of the school, mak- 
ing school experience life experiences; second, we 
must change the teacher’s training, making the 
teacher life-trained, instead of book-trained; third, 
we must break the deadening influence of a too 
strongly centralised system; we must individualise 
the schools rather than mass them. 
But is it possible to create public schools each of 
which will possess its own individuality, each of 
which will be the ideal school of its community ? 
The educational reformer usually starts his reform 
by projecting an ideal school. He does this in an- 
swer to what he believes the best parent, usually the 
well-to-do parent, wants, for his children. The re- 
former starts by carefully selecting the factors that 
go to make up the life of the school. He builds the 
plant, selects the children and the teachers and lays 
out the work to be done. He tries to make his 
school distinctive, the only one of its kind.
-P-A-G-E-215
The Direction of the New Start 209 
Can the system learn a lesson from the private 
school and the educational reformer? 
What the school system needs to understand is that 
its strength lies, not in the strength of the central or- 
ganisation, but in the strength of the individual 
school, not in making one school like another, but in 
making each-school a distinct unit... The need of the 
system is the preservation of its units, so that each 
school can keep itself alive, wide awake, responsive 
to its people, easily adaptable, the best of its kind. 
Before the school site is selected and before the 
plans are drawn for the building, the neighbourhood 
in which the school is to be located should be studied, 
so that the physical equipment of the building will be 
in conformity with the needs of the neighbourhood. 
The neighbourhood being regarded as a unit prob- 
lem, the school should be put in the civic centre of the 
neighbourhood, where the settlement, the hospital, 
the church, the library and the playground are. 
When these are lacking then the school should make 
provision for some of them at least. 
If the school is the most important unit in the 
whole educational system, the principal and his staff 
are the most important officials in the system. Prin- 
cipals and teachers should be placed in each school 
because these principals and teachers are best able 
to meet the problem of the school. The business of 
the system should then be to help those in direct touch
-P-A-G-E-216
  210 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
with the school problems, offering plenty of oppor- 
tunity for growth. 
Each individual school needs unity of organisation. 
There are school buildings that are used for day 
schools, night schools, summer schools, music centres, 
recreation centres, lectures, play centres. All these 
activities are in one building. “All the people come 
from the same district. All the problems that the 
varied activities serve are the common group prob- 
lems. Yet for each activity there is a separate head, 
each independent of the other and each responsible 
to its own department head. j 
The mere physical use of the plant does not mean 
complete use, definite heading towards a desired end. 
What is necessary is to make all these.activities re- 
sponsible to one leader so that he may co-ordinate 
them, permit their interplay. We havg.all the fea- 
tures of a settlement but without a leadef or without 
sacouncil of leaders. ‘The result is isolation in the 
‘vey work where there is need of the utmost co- 
erdination. Instead of using the people&s the focal 
point for developing school activities, thé system im- 
poses a curriculum that the people must follow. 
It is only a school with a oa and a 
continuous responsibility that can keep in*touch with 
the neighbourhood and, if necessary, help to create 
neighbourhood machinery, that will get the parents 
to work together. as

people, that schoolwill not enter deeply into the 
lives of the children df into the lives of the teachers.

First we must change the fundamental mistake, | 
that schools were made only for th® three R’s; sec- 
ond, we must change the notion thatateachers are 
trained by being cast in a mould; thirth*we must — 
change the idea that one school is to be organised 
just like another; fourth, we must change the notion 
that thé school is a cloistered institution, by break 
ing down its walls and having it come into di: 
contact with people. a 
In one school I found a common ground of ap- 
preciation in a co-operative garden idea. 
We chose two gardens, dirty, garbage filled lots 
they were. On one a neighbour street-cleaner was 
our partner. He was responsible for the general 
care of the plot. With him worked children who 
lived in his neighbourhood.
-P-A-G-E-218
  212 A Schoolmaster of the Great City 
To the children, the man working in the soil was 
a far more important man than the one who was 
sweeping the streets. Father farmer was more dig- 
nified than father street cleaner. The school had 
dignified labour and the parent keeping in contact 
with the child had become more hopeful. The 
school was no longer apart from the worker, but at 
one with him. Somehow the idea that the soil was 
our common interest made us forget that the home 
and the school were different. 
If it is good to have a garden where everybody can 
see the children at work, is it not equally as good to 
put clay rooms, wood-working rooms facing along 
the streets, even as the tradesmen’s shops are, so that 
the passerby may stop and watch the children at 
work? 
People have faith in the school even though they 
do not know what goes on behind the school doors. 
Because they have faith they throw more and more 
of their own responsibility on the school and the 
school shoulders the burden. The process must be 
reversed. 
The school must stop doing things for the people 
and get the people to do things for themselves by put- 
ting the work before them in such a way that they 
will be able to do it themselves. It is in this move- 
ment out of a cloistered environment into the com- 
mon lives of people that the school must share, be-

cause it means enriched responsibility through a con- 
sciousness of social values. 
The school must open its doors. It must reach out 
and spread itself, and come into direct contact with 
all its people. Each day the power of the school 
must be felt in some corner of the school district. It 
must work so that everybody sees its work and daily 
appraises that work. It-must-put-the responsibility 
on the parent, not so-much~the~individual parent 
as groups of parents, so that the individual acts or 
refrains from acting because the group conscious- 
ness is at his elbow and not in a distant school, or in 
an unknown law. 
The school must follow the lead of the social 
agencies. What have these social agencies done? 
They have gone out of their buildings, out of their 
offices and worked where the work would tell. 
What does the domestic science teacher of a settle- 
ment house do? She does not teach merely. She 
goes out to live with her neighbours,— those that 
need her, helps rebuild the home, then goes on to the 
next. 
What do the settlement nurses do? They go to 
the homes and help the people take care of their sick 
ones, thus relieving the hospitals. Home care under 
wise guidance takes the place of the institution. 
What do parents do who have come through united 
effort to appreciate school problems? They go back

to the home and compel the parent to give the child a 
fair chance, and they compel by helping. The 
neighbourhood holds up the individual home. 
See, too, how the playground tends to shift. 
From the park to the back yards of the tenements. 
The children play and the mothers need have no 
worry. Play, children’s healthy play, not harmful 
haphazard experiences, is going back into the home. 
Dr. Montessori has taken the kindergarten school, 
the nursery into the homes, directly in touch with the 
parents. The school is going back to the home. 
‘In the school-yard, I saw an old woman, her shawl 
about her head. She was talking to a group of chil- 
dren in her own native tongue. She was telling them 
stories, folk stories treasured for many years out of 
her peasant life abroad. Her voice was soft, 
dreamy. Her eyes were far off. The story-teller 
had come to the school. The home had come to the 
school. 
One morning when the school was gathered in the 
assembly hall, a young man seated himself at the 
piano and played out of the fulness of his larger ex- 
periences, played the songs of the masters. Now 
and then he stopped, he explained and went on. The 
artist parent was giving to the children the best that 
he had. The home had come into the school. 
The school has already done many of these things 
in a blind unconscious way. The school must now

directly and consciously organise its larger social life. 
It must go out of its doors as it were. It must use 
the factory, the stores, the neighbouring parks, the 
museums, not incidentally but fully and with deliber- 
ation. 
The teacher must go to market with her children. 
She must take the drawing class to the woods, the 
lakes, the streets, the open yards. She must bring 
into the building the artist, the musician, the singer, 
the advertiser, the picture man, the story teller. 
What the schools need is the push of the crowd. 
What the crowd needs is the pull of the child life. 
The school must become the people. 
As yet, the school has not been taken over by 
humanity. When the people recognise the possi- 
bilities of the school as they did those of the print- 
ing press, the school will become a thousand times 
more powerful in fostering race growth.

First we must change the kind of experiences that 
are given in the school; second, we must change the 
teacher’s training; third, we must individualise the 
school; fourth, we must give the school over to the 
people; fifth, we must change our attitude towards 
the child. ~ 
Do we really believe in children? Can we say \

with the Roman mother, ‘‘ These are my jewels.” 
How long ago is it that the state legislature passed 
a bill enabling the canneries to employ children and 
women twelve hours a day? Fifty children to a 
teacher, adulterated foods, military discipline, are not 
beliefs in children. Enslaving mothers is not a be- 
lief in children. 
Our belief in children like our belief in many other 
good things is mainly a word belief. What we need 
is a practical belief. We are still at the stage where 
we separate work and thought, action and theory, 
practice and ethics. If we would be saved we must 
follow the child’s way of life. His way is the direct 
way. Helearns from contact with the forces about 
him. He feels them, he sees them, he knows what 
they do to him. He thinks and does and discovers 
all in one continuous flow of energy. 
The child says, ‘“‘I am of things as they are. I 
am the fighter for the things that ought tobe. I was 
the beginning of human progress and I am the prog- 
ress of the world. I drive the world on. I invent, 
I achieve, I reform. About me is always the glory 
of mounting. I have no fear of falling, of slipping 
down, down. I have no fear of being lost. I am 
truth. I am reality and always I question chaos.” 
When the child begins to question the wisdom of 
the group, its religion, its literature, its dress, its 
tastes, its method of government, its standard of
-P-A-G-E-223

judgment, that moment the group should begin to 
take heed. It should take the child’s questioning 
seriously. When the group fails to do fis, it gives 
up its existence, it ceases to grow because it looks 
back, it worships tradition, it makes history ‘in terms 
of the past rather than in terms of the future. 
Belief in evolution is a belief in the child. 
What the race needs is a principle of growth, 
spiritual growth that can never be denied. Such a 
principle it will find in the child, because the spirit of 
the child is the one factor of the group existeacé\that 
in itself keeps changing, growing. The chil is 
nature’s newest experiment in her search for a better 
type and the race will be strong as it determines that 
the experiment shall be successful. , ‘ 
We develop national characteristics in accord vith 
our adherence to a common ideal. We must there- 
fore surrender ourselves for the common good and 
the common good to which we should surrender iY 
epitomised in the child idea. 
[I feel that the attitude towards the school and the’* 
chite i is the ultimate attitude by which America is’ 
to be judged. Indeed the distinctive contribution 
America is to make to the world’s progress is not 
political, economical, religious, but educational, the 
child our national strength, the school as the medium 
through which the adult is to be remade. |

When my father came to America he thought of 
America only as a temporary home. He learned 
little or no English. As the years went by he would 
say, “It is enough; my children know English.” 
Then more years rolled by. One day he came to me 
and asked me to help him get his citizenship papers. 
He and I began reading history together. Month 
after month we worked, labouring, translating, ques- 
tioning until the very day of his examination. 
That day I hurried home from college to find a 
smiling, happy father. “Did you get them?” I 
asked. 
“Yes, and the judge wanted to know how I knew 
the answers so well and I told him my son who goes 
to college taught me and the judge complimented 
me.” 
I have been a part of many movements to Ameri- 
canise the foreigner, but I see that the child is the 
only one who can carry the message of democracy 
if the message is to be carried at all. If the child 
fails to make the connection between the ideals of 
the school and the fundamental beliefs of the peo- 
ple, there is none other to do it. The children are 4 
‘the chain that must bind people together. 
I have told about parents growing because they 
sought growth for their children. I saw them grow 
through the initiative of the school. These were 
tenement dwellers. Would this thing hold where
-P-A-G-E-225
  The Direction of the New Start 219 
the parents are well to do, and the streets are clean 
and music is of the best, and home ideals are of the 
highest and the social life of the neighbourhood is 
intimate? Is it still necessary for the school to 
gather the parents about itself? Is it still necessary 
for the school to go out into the community and get 
the parents to consciously work as a group for the 
children’s interest, to consciously shape their phi- 
losophy of life in conformity with the dynamic phi- 
losophy that childhood represents? 
More necessary! If not to save the children, it 
should be done to save the parents. 
No matter who the people are, they need the 
school as a humanising force, so that they may feel 
the common interest, revive their visions, see the 
fulfilment of their dreams in terms of their children, 
so that they may be made young once more. Ameri- 
canise the foreigner, nay, through the child let us | 
fulfil our destiny and Americanise America. ;

CHAPTER VIII 
THE CHILDREN 
YESTERDAY the rain fell and the snow. I bent 
my head to the wind and went on. . Then I met a 
boy, a very small boy he was, not big enough to 
be at school. He ran to me and took my hand and 
smiled, and I laughed and raised my head and walked 
on stepping lightly to the music of the rain and the 
snow. 
Each day and every day, to school and from 
school, I meet you, hundreds of you. You smile 
and the welcome in your eyes is wonderful to see. 
You meet me and as you go you take me with you, 
free and joyous as yourself. Surely my life is 
blessed, blessed with the smiles of countless lips, 
blessed with the caress of countless greetings. 
Do you feel that you have need of me? Know 
then, oh, my children, that I have far more need of 
you. The burdens of men are heavy and you make 
them light. The feet of men know not where to 
go and you show them the way. ‘The souls of men 
are bound and you make them free. You, my beauti- 
ful people, are the dreams, the hopes, the meaning 
220  
-P-A-G-E-227

of the world. It is because of you that the world 
grows and grows in brotherly love. 
I look a thousand years ahead and I see not men, © 
ships, inventions, buildings, poems, but children, 
shouting happy children, and I keep my hand in 
yours and smiling dream of endless days.

AUTHOR’S PREFACE 
Tue history of education as an introductory subject for 
students in normal schools and colleges has recently re- 
ceived much criticism, largely because it has, as usually 
written and taught, had so little relation to present-day 
problems in education, and because it has failed to “func- 
tion,” to use a common expression, in orienting the prospec- 
tive teacher. The truth of such criticisms was brought out 
forcibly by a recent study which showed that, of the dozen 
most commonly used textbooks, only three gave as much 
as twenty-five per cent of their space to the developments 
of the past fifty years;‘that most of them devoted the 
great bulk of their space to ancient and medisval educa- 
tion and European development that most of them were 
cyclopeedic in character, and seemed constructed on the 
old fact-theory-of-knowledge basis; that only two or three 
attempted to relate the history they presented to present- 
day problems in instructioff; that only one made any real 
connection between the study of the history of education 
and the institutional efforts of the State in the matter of 
training; and that practically none treated the history of 
education in the light of either the recent important ad- 
vances in educational practice and procedure or the great 
social, political, and industrial changes which have given 
the recent marked expansion of state educational effort 
its entire meaning. © 
That the history of education, as usually taught, needs 
reorganizing, there can be little question." That for be- 
ginners, at least, much old subject-matter should be elim- 
inated and much new subject-matter added, also seems to 
be accepted without much question. ’ That it is too valu- 
able a subject to lose entirely also seems to most teachers 
to be true., What the beginning teacher needs, though, it 
 
-P-A-G-E-6
vill AUTHOR’S PREFACE 
seems to be somewhat generally conceded, is not a long 
course covering either the history of the evolution of our 
higher civilization or the various attempts of educational 
reformers to propose ideal solutions for the educational 
problem. On the contrary, what is offered to beginning 
students should be very practical, should be closely tied up 
with the social, political, and industrial forces which have 
shaped the nineteenth century, and should help the teacher 
to see the problems of the twentieth century in the light 
of their historic evolution and the probable lines of their 
future development. 
Education, with us, was a fruit of the movements which 
resulted from the Protestant Revolt of the sixteenth century, 
and the general awakening of Europe which was at that 
time taking place. Back beyond this historic event the be- 
ginning student scarcely need go. One short chapter will 
give the beginner the necessary historic background, and 
the study can then begin with the transfer of European 
civilization and educational zeal to our shores. Much 
time, too, need not be spent on our development before the 
first quarter of the nineteenth century, when the forces — 
national, state, philanthropic, social, political, and economic 
— which were potent in our educational development first 
began to find expression. The battle for taxation for edu- 
cation; the battle to eliminate the pauper-school idea; the 
battle to do away wit ill and th tax, and 
make the ts tas frees, the tattle to establish su- 
pervision; the battle to eliminate-seetarianism; the battle 
to extend and complete. the system by_adding. the high school and the state university; the struggle to establish 
normal schools, and begin the training of teachers; the 
gradual évolution of the graded system of ins instruction; and 
the opening of instruction of all grades to women; — these 
are the great milestones in our early national educational 
history which are of real importance for the beginning stu- 
dent of education to know. Of the educational reformers, 
the beginning can be made with Rousseau, as the inspirer     
 
-P-A-G-E-7
  
  AUTHOR’S PREFACE ix 
of Pestalozzi’s labors. Then Pestalozzi, Fellenberg, Froe- 
bel, and Herbart are the Europeans whose main ideas the 
student needs to grasp, and it was not until near the mid- 
dle of the nineteenth century that the work of the first two 
of these began to be made known to us by returning travel- 
ers and to influence the current of our national educational 
progress. The other educational reformers with whom the 
beginning student should become familiar are the practical 
constructive American thinkers who fought through our 
early state educational battles and shaped the traditions 
of our American state school systems. 
Up to the time of our Civil War we were engaged in lay- 
ing foundations and establishing principles of action. The 
great period of our educational development and expansion 
has been since 1860, since which time we have twice reor- 
ganized our elementary instruction, first in the light of the 
“faculty” psychology which came in with Pestalozzian 
ideas, and again in the light of the vast and far-reaching 
social and industrial changes of the past fifty years. We 
probably are now at the beginnings of a third reorganiza- 
tion, this time to include the high school as well. The kinder- 
garten, manual training, domestic arts, Herbartian ideas 
have also come from abroad since 1860, and been incor- 
porated into our educational theory and practice. The 
great stream of immigration which has come to our shores, 
the vast industrial revolution which has taken place, the 
destruction of the old-type home, the virtual disappearance 
of the apprenticeship system of training, the institution of 
compulsory education, new conceptions as to the education 
‘of delinquents and defectives, new child-welfare legislation, 
and the rise of a rural-life problem of great dimensions, — 
these are the more important changes and ‘forces of the 
past three decades which have necessitated extensive modi- 
fications in almost every aspect of our educational service. 
To enable our schools to meet these new problems of our 
changing democratic life, we have been forced to change the 
direction of our schools and to adapt the instruction given 
sith 
& x & 
 
-P-A-G-E-8
    = AUTHOR’S PREFACE 
to the new needs and conditions of society. A new educa- 
tional theory has been evolved, adjustments and differen- 
tiations in school work have had to be worked out, the edu- 
cation of defectives and delinquents has required new 
é and new state institutions, child-welfare work has 
been given an importance before unknown, the high school 
has had to be made over, vocational education and the 
improvement of agriculture and rural-life conditions have 
recently been made great national undertakings, the educa- 
tion of adults for literacy and intelligent citizenship has 
recently awakened a wide national interest, and the origi- 
nal one-course colleges have been transformed into great 
universities, training leaders for and ministering unto the 
needs of the State. The new problems in education have 
developed so rapidly, and have become problems of such 
national importance, that questions of educational reor- 
ganization and educational readjustment — the curricu- 
lum, the organization of the school, city education, rural 
and village education, county organization, state organiza- 
tion, national aid and oversight, and the study of education 
as a science — these and others have now everywhere been 
pushed to the front, and are matters of everyday discussion 
with which teachers and students of education should be 
familiar. Within the past quarter of a century we have 
come to see, with a clearness of vision not approached be- 
fore, that education is our Nation’s greatest constructive 
tool, and that the many problems of national welfare which 
education alone can solve are far greater than the school- 
master of two or three decades ago dreamed. 
To be familiar with recent development, to be able to 
view present-day educational problems in the light of their 
historical evolution and their political and social bearings, 
and to see the educational service in its proper setting as a 
great national institution evolved by democracy to help it 
solve its many perplexing problems, the writer holds to be 
of fundamental importance to the beginning student of edu- 
cation and the teacher in our schools. Such a study offers
-P-A-G-E-9
  
  AUTHOR’S PREFACE xi 
for education what a beginning course in history or econom- 
ies or science does, in that it gives the student the cardinal 
points of the compass for the journey in the study of the 
subject, gives the larger problems of the field their proper 
historical setting, states the problems of the present and 
near future in terms which give them significance, reveals 
the ignorance and prejudice against which those who la- 
bored to make possible the educational organization which 
we inherit worked, shows the relations existing between the 
different institutions of society engaged in the educational 
service, reveals the forces which circumscribe and condition 
and direct and limit all our educational endeavors, and sets 
forth the fundamental principles in the light of which we labor. 
It is from such a point of view that this book has been 
written. The first chapter gives the needed European back- 
ground; the next two describe the establishment of educa- 
tion on our shores, and trace its development through the 
colonial and early national periods; the next four trace the 
half-century of struggle to establish education as a function 
of the State, and cover the period up to about 1850; the next 
two chapters give the background, in the work of Rousseau 
and Pestalozzi, needed to understand the great reorganiza- 
tion of elementary education traced in the chapter which 
follows, and which covered the period from 1860 up to about 
1890; the far-reaching consequences of the vast social and 
industrial changes of the latter half of the nineteenth cen- 
tury are traced in Chapter XI; and the four remaining chap- 
ters deal with the’ twentieth-century problems which have 
arisen as a result of the social and industrial and political 
changes of the nineteenth century, and the attempts which 
have been made and are”being made to find a solution for 
them. All but the first two chapters deal with educational 
development since the beginning of our national period; two 
fifths of the book deal with the period since 1860; and one 
third of the book with the problems which have arisen since 
about 1890, the attempts we have made to find solutions for 
them, and a look ahead.

xii AUTHOR’S PREFACE 
This book is the outgrowth of many years of work in 
introducing beginning students to a study of the subject of 
education. For the past twenty-one years I have given the 
introductory course in the work of the Department of Edu- 
cation at the Leland Stanford Junior University. This 
course has been open to students of sophomore grade. At 
first I gave a course in the general history of education, 
beginning with the ancient civilizations and carrying the 
subject along to modern times. I soon came to feel that 
such a course, while of large value to the more advanced stu- 
dent of education, if made other than a fact course involves 
too mature thinking to be suitable to the needs of the begin- 
ning student. Then for a time I gave an introductory course 
on present-day educational theory and problems, but with- 
out the historical perspective. Then I changed again, and 
for the past dozen years have given the course substantially 
as presented in the present volume. In this last type of 
introductory course I have obtained an interest not awak- 
ened by either of the other plans. The course as at pres- 
ent given has been listed and described in the university 
announcements as follows: 
1. Public Education in the United States. A consideration of 
the more important present-day problems in the organization, 
administration, and adjustment of public education in the United 
States, studied in the light of their historical development. An 
introductory course. Lectures, following a syllabus, with assigned 
readings. 3 units, Autumn quarter. (Cubberley.) 
After the completion of this course the student, at Stan- 
ford, passes to a second elementary and introductory 
course, dealing with present-day educational practice, and 
entitled “Introduction to the Study of Education.” A text 
covering the work of this second course is now in prepara- 
tion. 
A number of my former students, who are now in college 
and normal-school positions as teachers of education, have 
taken my syllabus and have established similar courses in 
the institutions to which they have gone. They have
-P-A-G-E-11
IE Ot Nc 
AUTHOR’S PREFACE xiii 
repeatedly urged me to write up the course in book form, 
in part that they might use such a text with their classes, 
and in part that the course might find a wider place in nor- 
mal schools and colleges as an introductory course. This I 
have not found time to do until now. In this new form 
I have revised and expanded the old syllabus outline, and 
have tried to make a text which would be a still more use- 
ful introduction to the study of education than my course 
has been. In particular I have tried to catch the spirit of 
our American educational development, and to use the facts 
as a background upon which to paint the picture which our 
national evolution presents. I have also tried to make the 
book a history of administrative progress rather than of 
theories about education. 
To make the volume of greater teaching value I have ap- 
pended to the chapters a series of questions for discussion, 
and to most of the chapters a short list of topics for investi- 
gation and report. To make the references given of greater 
value I have selected them carefully, prefixed an asterisk 
to the more important ones, tried to indicate their length 
and value to the student, and have omitted all, regardless 
of value, not likely to be found in a small normal-school 
or college library. The text of the volume as it is, with 
the questions for discussion and collateral reading selected 
from the references given, makes a very satisfactory four- 
or five-unit course for a period of twelve weeks, or a three- 
unit course for a period of sixteen weeks.

PUBLIC EDUCATION > 
IN THE UNITED STATES 
CHAPTER I 
OUR EUROPEAN BACKGROUND 
Sources of our civilization. The problems which we are 
to-day facing in our American education have not come 
about by accident, but are the result of a long historical 
evolution, and are best understood if considered in the light 
of their historical development. / The history of education 
is essentially a phase of the history of civilization. School 
organization and educational theory represent but a small 
part of the evolution, and must be considered after all as 
but an expression of the type of civilization which a people 
has gradually evolved. The road that man has traveled 
since the days when might made right and children had no 
rights which even parents were bound to respect, to a time 
when the child is regarded as of first importance and adults 
represented in the State declare by law that the child shall 
be cared for and educated for the welfare of the State, is a 
long road and at times a very crooked one. Its ups and 
downs have been those of the progress of civilization itself, 
and in consequence any history of education must be in 
part a history of the progress of the civilization of the 
people whose educational history is being traced. 
The civilization which we to-day enjoy is a very complex 
thing, made up of many contributions, some large and some 
small, and from people in many different lands and ages. 
To trace even the different educational contributions back 
to their sources might be interesting, but it would take too 
long, and for our purposes would not be important. All 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
2 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
we need is sufficient background to give perspective and 
color to the sketch of the development of our American 
history and problems which it is here proposed to give. 
Even this takes us back to European lands, and especially 
to the later Middle Ages. 
The civilization which we have inherited has come down 
to us from three main sources, and in a fairly continuous 
stream. The Greeks, the Romans, and the Christians laid 
the foundations, and in the order named. On these three 
foundation stones, superimposed upon one another, our 
: modern European and American civilization rests. We 
| have made many additions in modern times, building an 
, entirely new superstructure on these old foundations, but 
the foundations for the structure of our civilization never- 
theless were laid by Greece and Rome and Christianity. 
The three foundation elements, The work of Greece 
underlies all else. This wonderful people introduced a new 
force into the world by placing a premium on personal and 
political freedom and initiative, and by developing a litera- 
ture, an art, and a philosophy,which was to be a heritage 
to all succeeding civilizations,/ In the lines of culture and 
philosophic thought the world will always remain debtor 
to this small but active, imaginative, artistic, and creative 
people. ‘To the Romans we are indebted for an entirely 
different ‘type of inheritance. They were weak where 
Greece was strong, and strong where Greece was weak. 
Their strength lay in law and government and the practical 
arts. Rome absorbed and amalgamated the whole ancient 
world into one Empire, to which she gave a common lan- 
guage, dress, manners, religion, literature, and government. 
By imposing law and order and government on an unruly 
world, and unifying the ancient civilizations into one organ- 
ized whole, Rome laid the necessary basis for the success of 
Christianity, and thus saved civilization from a great dis- 
aster when the Germanic hordes poured over her Empire. 
Into this Roman world, united by Roman arms and 
government, came the first of the modern forces of our 
o

Oe OUR EUROPEAN BACKGROUND 8 
present-day civilization — that of Christianity. Building 
on Greek philosophic ideas and Roman governmental forms, 
and with its new message for an old world, Christianity 
forms the connecting link and the preserving force between 
the old and the new civilizations. A new ethical force of 
the first importance was by it added to the effective energies 
of mankind, and a basis for the education of all, not to be 
realized for centuries, to be sure, was laid for the first time 
in the history of the world. 
Christianity, too, came at just the right time to enable it 
to organize and establish itself to meet and in time over- 
come and civilize the barbarian deluge from the North 
which, in the fifth and sixth centuries, poured over the 
boundaries of the Empire and almost obliterated the ancient 
civilizations. The fall of the Roman Empire, and the long 
struggle of the Christian Church to preserve civilization 
from complete destruction at the hands of the Germanic 
barbarians, is a story with which almost every one is 
familiar. ‘Progress ceased in the ancient world. The 
creative force of antiquity seemed exhausted. The diges- 
tive and assimilative powers of the old world were gone. 
Greek was forgotten. Latin was corrupted. The knowl- 
edge of the arts and sciences was lost. Schools disap- 
peared. Only the Christian Church remained to save 
civilization from the wreck, and it too almost went under. 
It took, ten centuries to partially civilize, educate, and 
reduce to national order this heterogeneous horde of new 
peoples, and to preserve enough of the ancient civilization 
so that the modern world has been able to reconstruct its 
main outlines from the fragments which remained. 
The period of the awakening. Finally, however, first in 
Italy, ‘and later in the new nations formed from the tribes 
which raided the ancient Empire, there came a period of 
awakening and discovery which led to a wonderful revival 
of ancient learning, a great expansion of men’s thoughts, 
a general questioning of all ancient authority, a great reli- 
gious awakening, a wonderful period of world exploration 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
    4 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
and discovery, the founding of new nations in new lands, 
the reawakening of the old Greek spirit of scientific inquiry, 
and the evolution of our modern civilization. It was out 
of these new impulses and forces that America was dis- 
covered; out of the contests incident to the great revolt 
against religious authority, known among Protestants as 
the Reformation, that America was in large part colonized; 
and out of the rediscovery of the ancient literature and 
learning in the days of the Renaissance, and the Protestant 
belief in general education as a means to salvation, that the 
early traditions of American education were derived. The 
three main forces to which we owe our settlement and”edu- 
cational beginnings were the Renaissance, the Protestant 
Revolt, and the beginnings of scientific inquiry and world 
exploration and trade. Let us examine each of these, briefly, 
in order. 
The thirteenth century has often been called the wonder- 
* ful century of the medieval world. It was wonderful 
largely in that the forces struggling against the oppressive 
medizevalism which had grown up as a result of the long ef- 
fort of the Church to Christianize the barbarian and reduce 
him to some form of civilized order, in this century first find 
clear expression. It was a century of rapid and unmistak- 
able progress in every line. It saw the evolution of the 
first of the universities, the beginnings of modern scholar- 
ship, the great era of guild-hall and cathedral building, a 
rapid expansion of reviving commerce, the rise of a burgher 
and lawyer class, distinct from the clergy and the nobility 
on the one hand and the craftsmen and apprentices on the 
other, and the evolution of modern States and modern lan- 
guages as expressive of the new feeling of nationality which 
was beginning to pervade Europe. The fourteenth century 
was a period of even more rapid change. New objects of 
interest were brought to the front, and new standards of 
judgment were applied. The medieval man, with his feel- 
ings of personal insignificance and lack of confidence, began 
to give way to men possessed of the modern spirit — men  
-P-A-G-E-29
OUR EUROPEAN BACKGROUND & 
conscious of a past behind and a future before them, and 
capable of independence, action, initiative, and enjoyment. 
With this transformation in the character of life and change 
in the nature of human interests, Europe was ready for a 
revival of learning. 
The Revival of Learning. The revival began in Italy, 
Petrarch (1304-1374) being regarded as the first modern 
scholar and man of letters in the Western World. In time 
the old monastic treasures were brought to light, the study 
of Greek was revived in the West, the first modern libraries 
and scientific academies were founded, and the history, lit- 
erature, religion, and political and social life of the ancient 
world were reconstructed. In 1396 the first professorship of 
Greek in a university was created at Florence, then the center 
of art and literature and learning in the Western World. 
So slowly did new ideas travel at that time that it was 
nearly a century before this revival began to be heard of 
north of the Alps. A professorship of Greek was created 
at Paris, in 1458; one at Seville in Spain, in 1473; and one 
at Vienna, in 1523. The German university of Erfurt 
established a professorship of Poetry and Eloquence, in 
1493. Greek came to Oxford about 1490. Very fortunately 
for the spread of the new learning, an important process 
and a great invention now came at a most opportune time. 
The new process was the manufacture of paper, obtained 
from Mohammedan sources, the first paper-mill being set 
up in Italy, in 1276. By 1450 paper was in common use 
throughout Europe, and the way was open for one of the 
world’s greatest inventions. This was made in German 
lands, the first engraved page dating from 1423, the first 
movable types from 1438, and the first printed book from 
1456. By 1475 the printing-press had been set up in the 
leading cities of Europe. From then on the way was open 
for a rapid extension of schools and learning, and the press 
was destined in time to surpass in importance the pulpit 
and the sermon, and to become one of the world’s greatest 
instruments for human progress and individual liberty.
-P-A-G-E-30
6 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
The new classical secondary school. The important and 
outstanding educational result of the revival of ancient 
learning by Italian scholars was that it laid the basis for a 
new type of school below that of the recently created col- 
leges and universities, and one destined in time to be much 
more widely opened to promising youths than the cathedral 
and monastic schools of the Middle Ages had been. [his 
new school, basing its curriculum on the intellectual in- 
ance recovered from the ancient world by Italian schol- 
ars, is keine as enclis atta training of the middle 
and higher classes of Society for the next four hundred years. 
This type of shoot was well under way by 1450, and it 
clearly controlled educati til after 1850. Out of the 
efforts of Teall schiglre to resurrect, reconstruct, under- 
stand, and utilize in education the fruits of our inheritance 
from the Greek and Roman worlds, modern secondary edu- 
cation, as contrasted—with medieval church education, 
Classical schools, known as Court Schools in Italy, 
Callézes and Lycées in France, Gymnasia in German lands, 
and Latin Grammar Schools in England, were founded. 
The reformed Latin Grammar School, founded by Dean 
Colet, at St. Paul’s in London, in 1510, thoroughly estab- 
lished the type, and was copied throughout England during 
the succeeding century. Many of the old cathedral and 
monastic schools of England were made over, after his 
model, into reformed Latin Grammar Schools to teach pure 
Latin and Greek and some elementary mathematics. In 
particular these schools were to teach Latin as a restored 
and living tongue. This type of secondary.school had be- 
come common all through England by 1600, and it was the 
type our early New England settlers knew and brought to 
and set up in the American-cotonies. 
The revolt against authority. Another outgrowth of the 
Italian Renaissance, and for the history of education in 
America a much more important development, was the 
change in attitude toward the dogmatic and repressive rule 
of the Church which came as a somewhat natural result of 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
OUR EUROPEAN BACKGROUND q 
the work of the Renaissance scholars, the new life in Chris- 
tendom consequent upon the Crusades, the revival of com- 
merce, the rise of city governments, the formation of lawyer 
and merchant classes, the founding of new States, the evolu- 
tion of the university organizations, and the discovery and 
spread of the art of prone All these forces united to 
awaken a new attitude‘toward the old religious problems, 
and'to prepare Western Europe for a rapid evolution out 
of the medizeval conditions which had for so long dominated 
all action and thinking. Had the Church realized this, and 
assumed a tolerant attitude toward the many progressive 
tendencies of the time, the whole history of modern life, 
and particularly the history of educational development in 
America, with which in this volume we are to be particu- 
larly concerned, might have been different. But it did not, 
and whether we be Catholic or Protestant makes no differ- 
ence with the facts of history. So far as the Protestant 
Reformation is concerned, we may believe that Luther and 
Zwingli and Calvin and Knox were merely ambitious and 
selfish disturbers who made trouble without cause, or we 
may go to the opposite extreme and believe that they were 
inspired men, leading the world back to a truer religion. 
The facts of history remain the same in either case, and our 
religious beliefs need in no way enter into the problem. 
The great outstanding fact remains that one Martin Luther, 
in 1517, disputed the practices of the Church, later defied 
its authority, and was excommunicated by it in 1520; that 
the German people, and especially the German princes, 
largely adopted Luther’s point of view and revolted; and 
that the revolt spread to other countries in the North and 
West of Europe, and as a result the Western or Roman 
Catholic Church, which had remained one for so many 
centuries and been the one great unifying force in Western 
Europe, was permanently divided. How much of Europe 
was lost to the Church is shown by the map on the following 
page. 
The resulting conflict. Of course the revolt against the

8 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
authority of the Church, once inaugurated, could not be 
easily stopped. This is nearly always the case when revo- 
lution has to be resorted to to secure progress or reform. 
The same right of freedom in religious belief which Luther 
claimed for himself and his followers had of course to be

extended to others. This the German, the English, and 
other Protestants were not much more willing to do than 
had been the Catholics before them. The world was not 
as yet ready for such rapid advances, and religious toler- 
ation, though established in principle by the revolt, was an 
idea to which the world required a long time to accustom

itself. It took a century and a half of intermittent religious 
warfare, during which Catholic and Protestant waged war 
on one another, plundered and pillaged lands, and killed 
each other for the salvation of their respective souls, before 
the people of Western Europe were willing to stop fighting 
and recognize for others that for which they were fighting 
for themselves. For still another century the world was 
divided into hostile camps as a result of the hatreds engen- 
dered by this religious warfare. When religious toleration 
became established by law, civilization had made a tremen- 
dous advance. The result of this long religious strife was 
to check the orderly progress of civilization, spread misery 
and suffering abroad, and drive from the countries perse- 
cuted those who would rather leave than conform. It was 
from among these irreconcilable non-conformists that the 
early settlers of most of our American colonies were drawn. 
The early educational history of America is hardly to be 
understood without some knowledge of the different reli- 
gious forces and hatreds awakened as a result of the Prot- 
estant Revolt. 
The dominant idea, and its educational consequences. 
|What we are primarily concerned with, however, are the 
educational consequences of this break with authority. To 
| understand this we need to know the dominant idea under- 
/lying Luther’s action, and for that matter the action of 
| Zwingli, Calvin, and Knox as well. The idea was that of 
| substituting the authority of the Bible in religious matters 
) for the authority of the Church, and was in turn one of the 
| results of the revival of the study of Greek and the recovery 
of the Gospels in the original. This meant the substitution 
| of individual responsibility for salvation for the collective 
| responsibility of the Church, and meant that those who 
| were to be saved, in theory at least, must be able to read 
the word of God, participate intelligently in the Church 
service, and shape their lives in accordance with the com- 
\mands of the Heavenly Father. Whether one accepts the 
Protestant position as sound or not depends largely on one’s
-P-A-G-E-34

religious training and beliefs, and need not concern us here, 
as it makes no difference with the course which history has 
actually taken. We can believe either way, and the course 
of history remains the same. 
The educational consequences of this position, though, 
were important, and are our chief concern. Under the 
older religious theory of collective judgment and collective 
responsibility for salvation — that is, the judgment of the 
Church rather than that of individuals — it was not im- 
portant that more than a few be educated. Under the new 
theory of individual responsibility promulgated by the 
Protestants the education of all became a vital necessity. 
To provide this meant the creation of an entirely new type 
of school —the elementary, for the masses, and in the 
native tongue — to supplement the secondary Latin schools 
of the Renaissance and the still older cathedral and monastic 
Latin schools for the education of those who were to become 
the leaders in Church and State. These schools were in 
time created, and the result of the evolution in the centuries 
since has been the development, all through Europe, of a 
double school system, the two parts of which — an elemen- 
tary school system for the masses, and a secondary school 
system for the classes — have but little in common. We 
in America started this way also, but before such a develop- 
ment had made much headway it was turned aside by the 
rise of a distinctively American and democratic spirit, as 
will be explained in subsequent chapters, which in time 
demanded one common school system for all. 
The modern elementary vernacular school then may be 
said to be essentially a product of the Protestant Reforma- 
tion. This is true in a special sense among those peoples 
which embraced some form of the Lutheran or Calvinistic 
faiths. These were the Germans, Moravians, Swedes, 
Norwegians, Danes, Dutch, Walloons, Swiss, Scotch, 
Scotch-Irish, French Huguenots, and the English Puritans. 
As the Renaissance gave a new emphasis to the development 
of secondary schools by supplying them with a large amount

OUR EUROPEAN BACKGROUND ul 
of new subject-matter and a new motive, so the Reformation 
movement gave a new motive for the education of children 
not intended for the service of the State or the Church, and 
the development of elementary vernacular schools was the 
result. Only in England, of all the revolting countries, did 
this Protestant conception as to the necessity of education 
for salvation fail to take root, with the result that elemen- 
tary education in England awaited the new political and 
industrial impulses of the latter half of the nineteenth cen- 
tury for its development. These educational attitudes 
were all faithfully reflected in the settlement of the American 
colonies, as we shall see in the next chapter. 
The discovery and settlement of America. The discovery 
of America was another development of the desire for travel 
and discovery awakened by the Crusades, the revival of 
commerce which now sought a sea-route to the riches of the 
Indies, and the new intellectual life in Christendom which 
stimulated thinkers to question the old theories as to the 
shape and position of our earth. These impulses led to the 
perfecting of the compass in the fourteenth century, the re- 
vival of geographical discovery, the rounding of the Cape of 
Good Hope (1487), the discovery of the new world (1492), and 
the circumnavigation of the globe by Magellan (1519-21). 
After the first century of exploration of the new continent 
had passed, and after the claims as to ownership had been 
largely settled, colonization began. The first, that of 
Virginia, was actuated wholly by gain, and rested on a com- 
mercial basis. This was also largely true of the other south- 
ern colonies. To the northward, however, the settlements 
were mostly due to the desire to secure religious freedom, 
and resulted from the warfare and persecution following the 
Protestant Revolt in Europe. Those who came to establish 
new homes along the bleak Atlantic coast did so that here, 
in a new land, they might establish their churches, order 
their civil life, and bring up their children to worship God 
after the dictates of their own conscience. It took a high 
degree of courage and deep religious conviction to cause men,
-P-A-G-E-36
  12 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
at that time, to take such a step, as it meant the giving up 
of all the associations of a lifetime and the bringing of their 
families to a new and unbroken land to start life over again. 
The result was that the American colonies settled from 
religious motives were from the first peopled by a splendid 
stock, and the character of this stock has repeatedly shown 
itself in the history of the different colonies and later in the 
history of our Nation. Just what our different colonists 
came for, what they tried to do by means of education, what 
types of schools and educational attitudes they established 
here, and how their belief in education for salvation or lack 
of such has colored our whole colonial and national history, 
it will*be the purpose of the chapters which follow to set 
forth. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. Would any type of general education be possible among a people 
where might made right? 
g. Give a number of illustrations to show the presence of Greek and 
Roman elements in the foundations of our civilization. 
8. Compare the barbarian invasions of the fifth and sixth centuries with 
the Bolshevik destructions of the twentieth. 
4. Why did it take so long for the revival of the study of Greek to extend 
over Western Europe? 
5. Show how the evolution of Latin higher schools for the education of 
boys from the middle and higher classes of society was a perfectly 
natural evolution. 
6. Show how the elementary vernacular school was a natural outgrowth 
of the Protestant Revolts and the invention of printing. 
7. Show that a class, instead of a common or mass system of education, 
has been perfectly natural for European states.

Religious origin of our schools. Schools, with us; as with 
the older European countries from which our early settlers 
calaeten as children of the Church. i From instruments 
of réligion they have been gradually changed into instru- 
ments of the State. The first schools in America were 
clearly the fruits of the Protestant Revolt in Europ¢) The 
reformers everywhere had insisted upon the necessity of the 
Gospels as a means to personal salvation. This meant, 
carried to its logical conclusion, that each child, girls as 
well as boys, should be taught to read so that they might x 
become acquainted-with the commandments of God and 
lear” what was naam or Gene Nee hag able to 
realize their ideals of life and worship in the old home lands, 
large numbers of religious congregations left Europe and 
came as bodies to America.\Here they settled in the wil- 
derness and began life anew. Among other things they 
brought with them their European ideas as to religion and 
the training of children, and hence a Etiropean background 
lies behind all the beginnings of American education. 
+Practically all of the early settlers of America came from 
among those people and from those lands which had em- 
braced some form of the Protestant faith, and most of then 
came to America to enjoy a religious freedom impossible in 
the countries from which they came. This was especially 
true of the French Huguenots, who settled along the coast 
of the Carolinas; the Calvinistic Dutch and Walloons, who 
settled in and about New Amsterdam; the Scotch and 
Scotch-Irish Presbyterians, who settled in New Jersey, and 
later extended along the Allegheny Mountain ridges into

Dunkers, and Reformed-Church Germans who settled in 
large numbers in the mountain valleys of Pennsylvania; 
and the Calvinistic dissenters from the English National 
Church, known as Puritans, who settled the New England 
colonies, and who, more than any others, gave direction 
to the fyture dey ion_i ‘ican 
States. ‘With practically all these early religious groups 
the education of the young for membership in the Church, 
and the perpetuation of a learned ministry for the congre- 
gations, immediately elicited serious attention. 
Englishmen who were adherents of the English national 
faith (Anglicans) also settled in Virginia and-the other 
southern colonies, and later in New York and New Jersey, 
“while Maryland was founded as the only Catholic colony, 
in what is now the United States, by a group of persecuted 
Catholics who obtained a grant and a charter from Charles 
IL, in 1632. These settlements are shown on the map oppo- 
site. As a result of these different settlements there was 
laid, during the early colonial period of our country’s his- 
tory, the foundation of those type attitudes toward educa- 
tion which subsequently so materially shaped the educa- 
tional development of the different States during the early 
part of our national history. These type attitudes were 
three in number. 
1. The compulsory-maintenance attitude 
The Puritans in New England. Of all those who came. 
to America during the early period, the Puritans who settled 
New England contributed most that_was valuable for_our 
future educational development, and established in practice 
principles which haye finally been generally adopted by our 
different States. Settling along the New England coast in 
little groups or congregations, they at once set up a combined 
civil and religious form of government which became known 
as a New England town. The “Meeting House” was the 
center of their civil and religious life, and in it they met 
both as a religious congregation and as a civil government. ‘
-P-A-G-E-40
  16 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
The two were one in membership and spirit. Being deeply 
imbued with Calvinistic ideas as to religion and government, 
the Puritans founded here a series of little town govern- 
ments, but loosely bound together in Colony federations, 
the corner stones of which were religion and education. The 
attitude of the early Puritans toward religion and learning 
is well expressed in the following extract from an early New 
England pamphlet, New England’s First Fruits, printed in 
London in 1643: 
After God had carried ts gafe to Mew England 
And wee had builded ovr hovges 
Provided necessaries for ovr tiveli hood

And getled the civi{ government

And tooked after wag to advance learning 
And perpetvate it to posterity 
reading to eave an iffiterate ministry 
Co the churches when ovr present ministers 
Aball tie in the Oust. 
At first home instruction and apprenticeship training were 
depended upon to furnish the necessary ability to read and 
to participate in the home and church religious services, the 
great religious purpose which had brought the colonists to 
America being the motive which was to insure such instruc- 
tion. In addition, the town religious governments began 
the voluntary establishment of town Latin Schools to pre- 
pare boys for the college (Harvard) which the colonial legis- 
lature had established, in 1636. In this establishment in 
the wilderness of New England of a typical English educa- 
tional system of the time — that is, private instruction in 
reading and religion in the homes and by the master of 
apprentices, Latin grammar schools in the larger towns to 
prepare boys for the colony college, and an English-type 
college to prepare ministers for the churches — we see mani- 
fested the deep Puritan-Calvinistic zeal for education as a 
bulwark of Church and sepia! in England, the -

BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 17 
The Massachusetts Law of 1642. It early became evi- 
dent, however, that these voluntary efforts on the part of 
the people and the towns would not be sufficient to insure 
that general education which was required by the Puritan 
religious theory. Under the hard pioneer conditions and 
the suffering which ensued, many parents and masters of ap- 
prentices apparently proved neglectful of their educational 
duties. Accordingly the leaders in the Puritan Church 
appealed to what was then their servant, the State as rep- 
resented in the colonial legislature, to assist them in com- 
pelling parents and masters to observe their obligations. The 
result was the famous Massachusetts Law of 1642, which x 
directed the officials of each town to-ascertain, from time to 
time, if parents and masters were attending to their educa- 
tional duties; if all children were being trained.“‘in learning 
and labor and. other.employments profitable to the Com- 
monwealth”’; and if the children were being taught “to read 
and understand the principles of religion and the capital 
laws of the country.” The officers were empowered to im- 
pose fines on those who failed to give proper instruction, or 
to report to the officer when required. This Law of 1642 
is remarkable in that, for the first time in the English-speak- 
ing world, a legislative body representing the State ordered 
that all children should be taught to read. This was a 
distinctively Calvinistic contribution to our new-world life, 
and a contribution of large future importance. 
The Massachusetts Law of 1647. The Law, however, 
did not establish schools, nor did it direct the employment 
of schoolmasters. After true English fashion, the provi- 
sion of education was still left with the homes. The results 
still continuing unsatisfactory, five years later the colonial 
legislature enacted the famous Law of 1647, by means of 
which it has been asserted that “the Puritan government of 
Massachusetts rendered probably its greatest service to the 
future.” After recounting in a preamble that it had in the 
past been “one chief point of that old deluder, Satan, to 
keep men from a knowledge of the Scriptures . . . by keep- 
 
-P-A-G-E-42

18 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
ing them in an unknown tongue,” so now “by persuading 
from the use of tongues,” ... learning was in danger of 
“being buried in the grave of our fathers in church and 
commonwealth,” the Law then ordered: 
‘1. That every town having 50 householders should at once 
appoint a teacher of reading and writing, and provide for his 
°§ ' wages in such manner as the town might determine; and 
2. That every town having 100 householders must provide a 
(Latin) grammar school to fit youths for the university, under a 
penalty of £5 for failure to do so. 
This Law represents a distinct advance over the Law of 
1642. The State here, acting again as the servant of the 
Church, enacted a law for which there were no English pre- 
cedents. Not only was a school system ordered established 
—elementary for all towns and children, and secondary 
for the youths in the larger towns — but, for the first time 
among English-speaking people, there was the assertion of 
the right of the State to require communities to establish 
and maintain schools, under penalty of a fine if they refused 
to do so. 
Importance of these two laws. It can safely be asserted 
that these two Massachusetts laws of 1642 and 1647 repre- 
x sent not only new educational ideas in the English-speaking 
world, but that they also represent the very foundation 
stones upon which our American public school systems 
have been constructed. 
Mr. Martin, the historian of the Massachusetts public 
school system, states the fundamental principles which 
underlie this legislation as follows: 
1. The universal education of youth is essential to the well- 
being of the State. 
2. The obligation to furnish this education rests primarily upon 
the parent. 
A 8. The State has a right to enforce this obligation. 
4. The State may fix a standard which shall determine the kind 
of education, and the minimum amount.
-P-A-G-E-43
  
BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 19 
5. Public money, raised by a general tax, may be used to pro- 
vide such education as the State requires. This tax may be 
general, though the school attendance is not. 
6. Education higher than the rudiments may be supplied by the 
State. Opportunity must be provided, at public expense, 
for youths who wish to be fitted for the university. 
Mr. Martin. then adds the following significant comment: 
It is important to note here that the idea underlying all this 
legislation was neither paternalistic nor socialistic. The child is _ 
to be educated, not to advance his personal interests, but because * 
the State will suffer if he is not educated. The State does not pro- 
vide schools to relieve the parent, nor because it can educate better 
than the parent can, but because it can thereby better enforce the 
obligation which it imposes. 
These laws became the basis for legislation in all the 
other New England colonies, except Rhode Island, which 
had been founded on the basis of religious freedom, and the 
conceptions as to the establishment and maintenance of 
schools which they embodied deeply influenced the educa- 
tional development of all 
the States to which New 
England people later mi- 
grated in any numbers. 
In New England, then, TA ‘2 
was established the first of (pa! 
the three important type. ww 
attitudes to which we ear~A '™ 
lier referred, —that of the 
State compelling the towns 
to establish schools, and 
parents to send their children to school to learn to read 
and to receive instruction in religion. The State here, act- 
ing as the servant of the Church, enacted legislation which 
formed a precedent and fixed a tradition as to school man- 
agement and support which was retained long after State 
and Church had parted company.         i

2. The parochial-school attitude 
Pennsylvania as a type. In New England the Puritan- 
Calvinists had had a complete monopoly of both Church 
and State. Into the middle colonies, best represented by 
Pennsylvania, there had come a mixture of peoples repre- 
senting different Protestant faiths, and no such monopoly 
was possible in these colonies. The English and Dutch had 
mixed in New York; the English, Dutch, Swedes, Scotch- 
Irish, and Germans had settled in New Jersey; while in 
Pennsylvania, which Penn had founded on the basis of 
religious freedom, a large number of English and German 
Protestant sects had settled. All were Protestant in faith, 
though representing different creeds and nationalities; all 
believed in the importance of being able to read the Bible as 
a means to personal salvation; and all made efforts looking 
toward the establishment of schools as a part of their church 
organizations. Unlike New England, though, no sect was in 
amajority. Church control by each denomination was, as a 
result, considered to be most satisfactory, and hence no ap- 
peal to the State was made by the churches for assistance 
in carrying out their religious purposes. The clergymen 
were usually the teachers in the parochial schools estab- 
lished, while private pay schools were opened in a few of the 
larger towns. These, as were the church services, were con- 
ducted in the language of the different immigrants. Girls 
were educated as well as boys, the emphasis being placed 
on reading, writing, counting, and religion, rather than 
upon any form of higher training. 
The result was the development in Pennsylvania, and to 
some extent in the other middle colonies as well, of a policy 
of depending upon Church and private effort for educa- 
tional advantages, and the provision of education, aside 
from certain rudimentary and religious instruction thought 
necessary for religious purposes, was left largely for those 
who could afford to pay for the privilege. 
Under the freedom allowed many communities made but
-P-A-G-E-45
BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 21 
indifferent provisions, or allowed their schools to lapse 
entirely. In the primitive conditions of the time the inter- 
est even in religious education frequently declined almost to 
the vanishing point. Two attempts were made, later on, 
to enforce the maintenance of schools in the colony; but one 
was vetoed by William and Mary as foreign to English prac- 
tices, and the other proved unenforceable. In consequence, 
Pennsylvania settled down to a policy of leaving education 
to private and parochial effort, and in time this attitude 
became so firmly established that the do-as-you-please idea 
persisted up to 1834, and was only overcome then after 
bitter opposition. In New Jersey and New York this same 
policy prevailed during the whole of the colonial period. 
Each parochial group did as it wished, and private and 
church effort, in pay and charity schools, provided prac- 
tically all the educational facilities available until well into 
our national period. 
3. The pauper-school non-state-interference attitude 
Virginia as the type. In the settlement of Virginia and 
the southern colonies, almost all the attending conditions 
were in contrast with those of the New England colonies. 
The early settlers were from the same class of English 
people, but with the important difference that, whereas the 
New England settlers were dissenters from the English 
National Church and had come to America to obtain free- 
dom in religious worship, the settlers in Virginia were ad- 
herents of that Church and had come to America for gain. 
The marked differences in climate and possible crops led to 
the large-plantation type of settlement, instead of the com- 
pact little New England town; the introduction of numbers 
of “indentured white servants,” and later negro slaves, led 
to the development of classes in society instead of to the 
New England type of democracy, making common schools 
impossible; and the lack of any strong religious motive for 
education naturally led to the adoption of English practices 
instead of the development of distinctively colonial schools. 7

22 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
The tutor in the home, education in small private and se- 
\ lect pay-schools, or education in the mother country for the 
“& sons of the well-to-do planters were the prevailing methods 
adopted among the wealthier people, while the poorer 
classes were left with only such advantages as apprentice- 
ship training and the few pauper schools of the time might 
provide. 
Practically all the Virginia colonial legislation relating 
‘to education refers either to William and Mary College, 
founded in 1693, or to the education of orphans and the chil- 
sf.dren of the poor. Both these interests were typically Eng- 
lish. The seventeenth-century legislation included the com- 
pulsory apprenticeship of the children of the poor, training in 
a trade, the requirement that the public authorities must 
provide opportunities for this type of education, and the use 
of both local and colony funds for the purpose — all, as the 
Statutes state, “according to “(tera nt laudable custom 
  in the Kingdom of England.” {It was not until 1705, that 
Virginia reached the point reached by Massachusetts in 
1642 of requiring that “the master of the [apprenticed] 
orphan shall be obliged to teach him to read and write.” 
During the entire colonial period the indifference of the 
mother country to general education was steadily reflected 
in Virginia and the other colonies which followed the Eng- 
lish example. As in the mother country, education was.net 
3 of E the State, nor did the Church 
to it. Virginia thus stands as 
the clearest example of the third type of colonial attitude 
& toward education, — viz., tutors and private schools for 
those who could afford them, church charity schools for 
some of the children of the poorer members, but it no State 
interest in the problem of education except to see that 
vrphans and children of the very poor were properly ap- 
prenticed and trained in some useful trade, which in Vir- 
ginia usually was agriculture. . 
This type in other colonies. In the other American col- 
onies which followed the example of Virginia — New 
   
-P-A-G-E-47
  BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 23 
York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, the Carolinas, and 
Georgia — the English charity-school idea largely domi- 
nated such education as was provided, with the apprentic- 
ing of orphans a prominent feature. The “Society for the 
Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts,” an English 
society, chartered in 1701, to act as an auxiliary of the 
Church of England “to train children in the tenets and wor- 
ship of the Church, through the direct. agency of schools,” 
provided for these Anglican colonies probably the best 
charity schools in America during the later colonial period. 
The work of this Society in New York was specially note- 
worthy, though valuable work was done in other colonies. 
Its schoolmasters were well selected and sound in the faith, 
and the children were taught reading, writing, a little arith- 
metic, the catechism, and the religious observances of the 
English National Church. The church charity schools of 
this Society furnished the nearest approach to a free school 
system found in the Anglican colonies before the Revolution. 
They were, though, only for a class, being usually open only 
to the children of the poorer communicants in the Anglican 
Church. 
Type attitudes represented by 1750. The seventeenth 
century witnessed the transplanting of European ideas as to 
government and religion and education to the New Ameri- 
can colonies, and by the eighteenth century we find three 
clearly marked types of educational practice or conceptions 
as to educational respensibility established on American soil. 
The first was the strong Calvinistic conception of a re- 
ligious State, supporting a system of common schools, 
higher Latin schools, and a college, both for religious and 
civic ends. This type dominated New England, and is 
best represented by Massachusetts. From New England 
it spread westward, and deeply influenced the educational 
development of all States to which New England people 
migrated. It was the educational contribution of Calvinism 
to America. Out of it, by the later separation of Church and 
State, our modern state school systems have been evolved,
-P-A-G-E-48
ee ee | 
24 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Ke The second was the parochial school conception of the 
Dutch, Moravians, Mennonites, German Lutherans, Ger- 
man-Reformed Church, Quakers, Presbyterians, Baptists, 
and Catholics. This type is best represented by Protestant 
Pennsylvania and Catholic Maryland. It stood for chure 
control of all edueational-effert, resented state interference, 
was dominated only by church purposes, and in time came 
to be a serious obstacle in the way of state organization and 
control. 
The third type, into which the second type tended to fuse, 
was the attitude of the Church of England, which conceived 
of public education, aside from collegiate education, as in- 
tended chiefly for orphans and the children of the poor, and 
as a charity which the State was under little or no obliga- 
tion to assist in supporting. All children of the upper and 
middle classes in society attended private or church schools, 
or were taught by tutors in their homes, and for such in- 
struction paid a proper tuition fee. Paupers and orphans, in 
limited numbers were, for a limited time, provided with some 
form of useful education at the expense of either the Church 
or the State. 
These three types or attitude toward public education be- 
came fixed American types, and deeply influenced subse- 
quent American educational development, as we shall see in 
the chapters which follow. 
II. Typrs or SCHOOLS TRANSPLANTED AND DEVELOPED 
Transplanting the old home institutions. At the time the 
early colonists came to America the parish elementary school 
for religious training had become an established institu- 
tion in German lands, while in England three main types 
of schools had been developed. All of these were trans- 
planted to America, and established here in much the same 
form that they had developed in the home lands. The 
Dutch in New Amsterdam, the Swedes along the Delaware, 
and the different German sects in Pennsylvania and the 
other colonies where they settled, reproduced in America the 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION ° 2 
Lutheran’ parish school of Europe, with its instruction in 
reading, singing, religion, and sometimes writing, and taught 
usually by the pastor, but sometimes by the sexton or other 
teacher. This type of school continued largely unchanged 
throughout the whole of the colonial period. The English, 
who formed the great bulk of the early immigrants to the 
American colonies, reproduced in the different colonies the 
- main types of schools at that time existing in the mother 
country. These were the petty or dame school, the writ- 
ing school, and the Latin gra lat school for those who 
could afford to y pay for € charity or pauper ele- 
mentary school for a limited number 6f-indigents; and ap- 
prenticeship training for orphans and the children of pauper 
parents. The first three became the characteristic schools of 
New England, and the last two largely characterized the Eng- 
lish educational work in the central and southern colonies. 
It was these English-type schools, rather than the conti- 
nental European type of parochial school of the central 
colonies, which exerted the greatest influence on our early 
American educational development. 
‘he petty or dame school. The dame nade was a very 
elementary school, kept in a kitchen or living room by some 
woman who, in her youth, had obtained the rudiments of an 
education, and who now desired to earn a pittance for her- 
self by imparting to the children of her neighborhood her 
small store of learning. For a few pennies a week the dame 
took the children of neighbors into her home and explained 
to them the mysteries connected with learning the begin- 
nings of reading and spelling. Occasionally a little writing 
and counting also was taught, but not often. Originating 
in England after the Reformation, and introduced into New 
England by the early colonists, it flourished greatly in 
America during the eighteenth century, while in England 
it continued popular until well into the nineteenth. While 
men teachers were employed at first in the town schools, 
the dame school soon became the primary school of colonial 
New England, and instruction in the A B Cs and the ele-

  26 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
ments of reading and writing in it became a prerequisite for 
admission to the town grammar school. 
Origin of the school of the 3-Rs. The second type of 
school brought over was the writing school, a school in 
which writing, reckoning, and the simplest elements of mer- 
chants’ accounts were taught. The masters in this also gave 
instruction in writing to the boys in the third type of school 
brought over—the Latin grammar school. Sometimes 
the instruction was given in a separate school, taught by a 
“scrivener” and arithmetic teacher, and sometimes the 
writing and reckoning were taught by a peripatetic scrive- - | 
ner, who moved about as business seemed to warrant. The 
writing school never became common in New England, as 
the exigencies of a new and sparsely settled country tended 
to force a combination of the dame and the writing school 
into one, thus forming the school of the so-called 3-Rs — 
“Readin, Ritin, and Rithmetic” —from which our ele- 
mentary schools later were evolved. Among the Dutch, 
Quakers, and Germans of the middle colonies as well this 
combination was commonly found in their parochial schools, 
and from it their elementary schools also evolved. 
The Latin grammar school. The third type of school 
brought over, and for New England the important school 
of the early period, was the Latin grammar r school. In this 
the great teachers of the early ‘time were found. By this 
was meant a school for-beginners in Latin, still the sacred 
language of religion and learning, and upon the study of 
which the main energy of the schools was spent. The school 
took the boy from the dame school at the age of seven or 
eight, and prepared him for entrance to college at fifteen, 
or thereabout, the boy in the meantime having learned to 
read, write, and make his own quill pens, and having mas- 
tered sufficient Latin to enter the college of the colony. 
He was usually ignorant of numbers, and was usually un- 
able to write English with any degree of fluency or accuracy. 
He was, however, well schooled in the Latin tongue, and usu- 
ally in the elements of Greek as well. The purpose of the

learned to read chiefly the Catechism and the Bible, and to 
know the will of the Heavenly Father. There was scarcely 
any other purpose in the maintenance of elementary schools. 
In Connecticut colony the law required that the pupils were 
to be made “in some competent measure to understand the 
main grounds and principles of Christian Religion necessary 
to salvation,” and “to learn some orthodox catechism.” 
In the grammar schools and the colleges students were in- 
;. structed to consider well the main end of life and studies. 
®* These institutions existed mainly to insure a supply of 
learned ministers for service in the Church and the State. 
Such studies as history, geography, science, music, drawing, 
secular literature, and physical training were unknown. 
Children were constantly surrounded, week days and Sun- 
days, by the somber Calvinistic religious atmosphere in 
New England, and by the careful religious oversight of the 
pastors and elders in the colonies where the parochial school 
system was the ruling plan for education. Schoolmasters # 
were required “to catechise their scholars in the principles 
of the Christian religion,” and it was made “‘a chief part of 
the schoolmaster’s religious care to commend his scholars 
and his labors amongst them unto God by prayer morning 
and evening, taking care that his scholars do reverently | 
attend during the same.” Religious matter constituted the ~ 
only reading matter, outside of the instruction in Latin in 
the grammar schools. The Catechism was taught and the 
Bible was read and expounded. Church attendance was re- 
quired, and grammar school pupils were obliged to report 
each week .on the Sunday sermon. This insistence on the 
religious element was more prominent in Calvinistic New 
England than in the colonies to the south, but everywhere 
the religious purpose was dominant. The church paro- 
chial and charity schools’ were essentially schools for in- 
stilling the church practices and the beliefs of the churches 
maintaining them. ‘This state of affairs continued well 
toward the beginning of our national period. 
This dominance of the religious purpose was well shown

in the textbooks used for instruction. Down to the time 
of the American Revolution these were English in their 
origin and religious in their purpose. The Hornbook, the 
Primer, the Psalter, the Testament, and the Bible were the 
books used. It was not until about the time of the Revo- 
lution that the first American secu- 
lar textbook appeared. 
The textbooks used. Instruc- 
tion at first everywhere began with 
the Hornbook, from which children 
learned their letters and began to 
read. This was a thin board on 
which a printed leaf was pasted, 
and this was covered with a thin 
sheet of transparent horn to pro- 
tect it from dirty fingers. Figure 6 
shows a common form of this 
early type of primer, the mastery 
of which usually required some 
time. Cowper thus describes this 
little book:

Having learned to read, the child next passed to the Cate- 
chism and the Bible; these constituted the entire range of 
reading in the schools. 
The New England Primer. In 1690 there appeared a won- 
derful little volume, known as The New England Primer, 
which at once leaped into popularity and soon superseded 
the Hornbook as the beginning reading text, not only in New 
England but in the schools of all the colonies except those 
under the control of the Church of England. For the next

century and a quarter it was the chief school and reading 
book in use among the Dissenters and Lutherans in America. 
| Such spelling as was taught was taught from it also. Being 
religious in the nature of its contents it was used both in the 
school and the church, the schoolmasters drilled the children 
in the reading matter and the catechism in the schools, and 
the people recited the catechism yearly in the churches. 
Every home possessed copies of it, and it was for sale at 
all bookstores, even in the smaller places, for a century and 
a half. It was reprinted throughout the colonies under 
different names, but the public preferred the title New Eng- 
land Primer to any other. Its total sales have been esti- 
mated to have been at least three million copies. It was used 
in the Boston dame schools as late as 1806, and in the coun- 
try districts still later, but was gradually discarded for 
newer types of secular readers. Compared with the primers 
and first readers of to-day it seems poor and crude, but 
probably no modern textbook will ever exercise the influ- 
ence over children and adults which was exercised by this 
little religious reader, 34 by 43 inches in size, and but 88 
pages thick. It has been said of it that “it taught millions 
to read, and not one to sin.” The Psalter, the Testament, 
and the Bible were its natural continuation, and constituted 
the main advanced reading books in the colonies before 
about 1750. 
Other texts. A textbook was seldom used in teaching 
arithmetic by the colonial schoolmasters. The study itself 
was common, but not universal. It was not until the begin- 
ning of our national period that arithmetic was anywhere 
made a required subject of instruction. The subject was 
regarded as one of much difficulty, and one in which few 
_ teachers were competent to give instruction, or few pupils 
competent to understand. To possess a reputation as an 
“arithmeticker” was an important recommendation for a 
teacher, while for a pupil to be able to do sums in arithmetic 
was a matter of much pride to parents. Teacher’s contracts 
frequently required that the teacher should
-P-A-G-E-55
CE ar Tn ae 1 eet 
BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION _— 83 
— do his faithful, honest, and true endeavor to teach the chil- 
dren or servants of those who have subscribed the reading and 
writing of English, and also arithmetick, if they desire it; as much 
as they are capable to learn and he capable to teach them within 
the compas of this year. 
The teacher might or might not possess arf arithmetic of his 
own, but the instruction to pupils was dictated and copied 
instruction. Each pupil made his own written book of rules 
and solved problems, and most pupils never saw a printed 
arithmetic. It was not until about the middle of the eigh- 
teenth century that printed arithmetics came into use, and 
then only in the larger towns. 
Writing, similarly, was taught by dictation and practice, and 
the art of the “scrivener,” as the writing master was called, 
was very elaborate and involved much drill and many flour- | 
ishes. The difficulty of mastering the art, its lack of practi- | 
cal value to most children, the high cost of paper, and the 
necessity usually for special lessons, all alike tended to make 
writing a much less commonly known art than reading. | 
For the Latin grammar schools the great American text: 
book, for more than a century, was Cheever’s Accidence, 
prepared by perhaps the most famous of all early American 
schoolmasters, Ezekiel Cheever. The book was prepared | 
while Mr. Cheever was in charge of the Latin grammar 
school at New Haven (1641-1650), and was published prior 
to 1650. For more than a hundred years this was the text- 
book of the Latin grammar schools of all New England, and 
it was also extensively used as a text wherever Latin was 
taught in the other American colonies. 
The teachers. The best teachers during the earlier co- 
lonial period were the teachers in the Latin grammar schools 
of New England. They were usually well-educated men, 
strict in the faith, and capable as teachers. A few attained 
a fame which has made them remembered to the present 
time. Among these Ezekiel Cheever (1614-1708), men- 
tioned above, a graduate of Cambridge, in England, who 
came to America at the age of twenty-three, and who served    
-P-A-G-E-56
ee re en ee 
84 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
for seventy years as a teacher in New England and for 
thirty-eight years as head of the Boston Latin School; and 
Elijah Corlett (1611-1687), for forty-three years head of the 
Cambridge Latin School, were the most famous. Of these, 
Cotton Mather wrote, at the time of the death of Cheever: 
Tis CORLETS pains, & CHEEVER’S, we must own, 
‘That thou, New England, art not Scythia grown. 
Many of the early teachers in the reading schools were 
men of some learning, but the meager pay in time turned 
the instruction in these schools over to college students and 
local or itinerant schoolmasters in winter, and to women in 
summer, and eventually the dame school supplanted the 
town elementary school. (Girls were usually admitted to 
the summer, but not to the winter school, and they were 
taught only reading, writing, and religion. The teachers 
\ in the middle-colonies parochial schools were usually good, 
carefully selected by their churches, sound in the faith, and 
rendered service which for the time was reasonably satis- 
factory. This was especially true of the teachers in the 
schools of the Anglican Church “Society for the Propaga- 
tion of the Gospel in Foreign Parts,” which operated in many 
towns and cities in the English colonies between 1702 and 
1782. The poorest teachers were to be found in the private 
schools, many of them being itinerant teachers. Others 
were of the so-called “indentured white servants” class — 
poor men or criminals sent over from England and sold for a 
certain number of years of labor, usually four or five, to pay 
for their passage. ees Jet_out by their purchasers 
to conduct a school, the proceeds of which went to their 
owners. The advertisement shows such a teacher for sale,

versally followed in teaching. Children came forward to the 
teacher’s desk and recited individually to the master or 
dame, and so wasteful was the process that children might 
attend school for years and get only a mere start in reading 
and writing. Hearing lessons, assigning new tasks, setting 
copies, making quill pens, dictating sums, and keeping order 
completely absorbed the teacher’s time. 
IV. CHANGE IN CHARACTER AFTER ABOUT 1750 
The period of establishment. The seventeenth century 
was essentially a period of transplanting, during which lit- 
tle or no attempt at adaptation or change was made. The 
customs of the mother countries in manners, morals, dress, 
religious observances, education, and classes in society were 
all carefully transplanted. In most of, the colonies the 
early settlements were near the coast. This was particu- 
larly the case in New England, where the danger from In- 
dian massacres had been greater than farther south. King 
Philip’s War (1675-78) had cost the New England colonists 
half a million dollars — a large sum for that time — and 
had almost exhausted the people. Twelve out of the ninety 
existing towns had been destroyed, and forty others had wit- 
nessed fire and massacre. A number of towns were so poor 
they could not pay their colony taxes, and the maintenance 
of schools, either by tuition or tax, became exceedingly 
difficult. 
The general result, though, of the war was such a punish- 
ment of the Indians that the colonists felt free thereafter 
to form settlements inland, and a marked expansion of New 
England took place. The same was true of the central 
colonies, new settlements now being founded farther and 
farther inland. These new towns in the wilderness, owing 
their foundation to an entirely different cause than the 
original towns, and being founded by younger people who 
had never known European religious zeal or oppression, at 
once gave evidence of less interest in religion and learning 
than had been the case with the towns nearer the coast. 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
88 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Even in these earlier coast towns, the second and third 
generation then in control began to turn from religion and 
agriculture to shipping and commerce, and with the rise 
of trade new interests began slowly to displace the dominant 
religious concern of the early colonists. 
Waning of the old religious interest. As early as 1647 
Rhode Island had enacted the first law providing for free- 
dom of religious worship ever enacted by an English- 
speaking people, and two years later Maryland enacted a 
similar law. Though the Maryland law was later over- 
thrown, and a rigid Church-of-England rule established 
there, these laws were indicative of the new spirit arising in 
the New World. The witchcraft persecutions at Salem and 
elsewhere in New England did much to weaken the hold 
of the ministry on the people there. By the beginning of 
the eighteenth century a change in attitude toward the 
old problem of personal salvation and church attendance 
became evident. New settlements amid frontier conditions, 
where hard work rather than long sermons and religious dis- 
putations were the need; the gradual rise of a civil as op- 
posed to a religious form of town government; the incfease 
of new interests in trade and shipping, and inter-colony com- 
merce; the beginnings of the breakdown of the old aristo- 
cratic traditions and customs, originally transplanted from 
Europe; the rising individualism in both Europe and Amer- 
ica; — these all helped to weaken the hold on the people of 
the old religious doctrines. The importation of many “in- 
dentured white servants,” who for a time were virtually 
slaves, and the deportation from England of many paupers 
and criminals from the English jails, most of whom went 
to the central and southern colonies, likewise tended not 
only to reduce the literacy and religious zeal of the colonies, 
but also to develop a class of “poor whites’ who later 
deeply influenced educational progress in the States in which 
they settled. 
By 1750 the change in religious thinking had become quite 
marked. Especially was the change evidenced in the dying

40 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
out of the old religious fervor and intolerance, and the break- 
ing up of the old religious solidarity. While most of the col- 
onies continued to maintain an “established church,” other 
sects had to be admitted to the colony and given freedom 
of worship, and, once admitted, they were found not to be so 
bad after all. The Puritan monopoly of New England was 
broken, as was also that of the Anglican church in the cen- 
tral colonies. The day of the monopoly of_any sect in a 
colony was over. New secular interests began to take the 
place of religion as the chief topic of thought and conversa- 
tion. Secular books began to dispute the earlier monopoly of 
the Bible, and a few colonial newspapers (seven by 1750) were 
founded and began to circulate.” “All thesé changes-materi- 
ally affected both the support and the character of the edu- 
ae provided in the colonies. 
Changing character of the schools. These changes man- 
ifested themselves in many ways in the matter of educa- 
tion. The maintenance of the Latin grammar schools, 
required by the Law of 1647, had been found to be increas- 
ingly difficult of enforcement, not only in Massachusetts, but 
in all the other New England colonies which had followed 
the Massachusetts example. With the changing attitude of 
the people, which had become clearly manifest by 1750, the 
demand for relief from the maintenance of this school in 
favor of a more practical and less aristocratic type of higher 
school, if higher school at all were needed, became marked, 
and by the close of the period the more American Academy, 
with its more practical studies, had begun to supersede the 
old Latin grammar school. 
The elementary schools experienced something of the same 
difficulties. Some of the parochial schools died out, and 
others declined in character and importance. In Church of 
England colonies all elementary education was now left 
to private initiative and philanthropic or religious effort. 
In the southern colonies the classes in society made common 
tax-supported schools impossible. In New England the 
eighteenth century was a continual struggle on the one hand
-P-A-G-E-61
  (BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 41 
to prevent the town school from dying out, and on the other 
to establish in its place a series of scattered and inferior dis- 
trict schools, while tuition fees and taxation for support be- 
came harder and harder to obtain. Among other changes of 
importance the reading school and the writing school now 
became definitely united in all smaller places and in the 
rural districts to form the American elementary school of 
the 3-Rs, while the dame school was definitely adopted as 
the beginners’ school. Both these changes were measures 
of economy, as well as distinctively American adaptations. 
New textbooks, containing less of the gloomily religious 
than the New England Primer, and secular rather than 
religious matter, appeared and began to be used in the 
schools. Dilworth’s A New Guide to the English Tongue, 
first published in England in 1740, began to be used in the 
American colonies by 1750. This contained words for 
spelling and a number of fables, and was the first of a line 
of some half-dozen so-called spelling books which finally 
culminated in the first distinctively American textbook — 
Noah Webster’s blue-backed Spelling Book, first published 
at Hartford, in 1783. 
Disintegration of the New England town. One of athe 
most fundamental changes which now took place among 
New England people, and one which vitally modified future 
educational administration in almost all our American 
States, was the breakdown of the unity of the old New Eng- 
land town and the rise of the school district as the unit for 
school maintenance in its stead. It came about in this way. 
Originally each New England settlement was a unit, and 
the irregular area included — twenty to forty square miles, a 
little smaller than a western township— was called a town. 
At the center, and usually facing on the town common, were 
the Meeting-House and the town school, and later the town 
hall. All citizens were required by law to live within one 
half-mile of the Meeting-House, to attend the town meet- 
ings, and to send their children to the town school. In the 
town meeting, at first held in the churches, all matters re- 
ae
-P-A-G-E-62

lating to the interests of the town were discussed, taxes 
Fic. 11. Saowixe tar Evo.vution or THE

by-laws were enacted. 
In time these towns, 
originally founded as re- 
ligiousrepublics, became 
centers for the discussion 
of all forms of public 
questions, and schools 
for training the people 
in the principles of gov- 
ernment and parliamen- 
tary procedure. In them 
the people learned how 
to safeguard their own 
interests. 
By the close of the 
seventeenth century, as 
has been stated, many 
of the forces which at 
first required a compact 
form of settlement had 
begun to lose their hold. 
New settlements arose 
within the towns, miles 
away from the meeting- 
and schoolhouses. To 
attend church or town 
meeting in winter was 
not always easy, and for 
children to attend the 
town school was impos- 
sible. The old laws as 
to place of residence ac- 
cordingly had to be re- 
pealed or ignored, and 
as a result church en-
-P-A-G-E-63
  BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 48 
thusiasm, town as opposed to individual interests, and zeal 
for education alike declined. New towns also arose farther 
inland, which soon broke up into divisions or districts. By 
1725 the population of most of the towns had been scat- 
tered over much of the town’s area, and small settlements, 
cut off from that of the central town by hills, streams, forest, 
or mere distance, had been formed. Due to the difficulties 
of communication, these little settlements tended to become 
isolated and independent. 
The rise of the district system. As the tendency to sub- 
divide the town became marked, these subdivisions de- 
manded and obtained local rights. The first demand was 
for a minister of their_own, or at least for separate services. 
As a result parishes were created within the town, and each 
parish, with its parish officers, became a new center for the 
rise of democracy and the assertion of parish rights. ‘The 
town was next divided into road districts for the repair and 
maintenance of roads, and then into districts for recruiting 
the militia, and for assessing and collecting taxes. All these 
decentralizing tendencies contributed toward the growth of 
‘a district consciousness and the breakdown of town govern- 
ment. The establishment of dame schools in the district 
parishes in the summer, which had become an established 
institution in New England by 1700, and the presence of 
private tuition-schools taught by a master in the winter, 
naturally provided more convenient schooling than the dis- 
tant town school afforded. This latter, too, had usually 
been supported in part at least by a tuition fee or a tax (rate 
bill) on the parents of children attending. The result was 
a serious crippling of the central town school, which the laws 
required must be maintained. The towns finally found it 
necessary to meet the competition by making the town. 
school entirely free, but to do this the general taxation of 
all property had to be resorted to. 
This was the opportunity of the parishes, and the price 
they demanded for consent to a general town tax for schools 
was the division of the central town school. Either the
-P-A-G-E-64
  44 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
school must be moved about, and taught proportionately 
in each parish, or separate schools must be established and 
maintained in each. ‘The result, at first, was the movin, 
town school, which became established in New England by 
about 1725, the school being held in each parish and at the 
center of the town a number of weeks each year propor- 
tional to the amount of taxes for education paid by each. 
The next step was to give back to each parish, or school dis- 
trict as it now came to be called, the money it had-paid 
and let it maintain its own school. This came about during 
the latter part of the eighteenth century, and the right to 
elect school trustees, levy district school taxes, and select a 
teacher alone were needed to complete the establishment of 
the full district system. These were legally granted in all 
the New England States shortly after the close of the Rev- 
olutionary War. From New England the district system 
in time spread over nearly all of the United States. — 
Rise of the civil or state school. As has been stated ear- 
lier, the school everywhere in America arose as a child of 
the Church. In the colonies where the parochial-school con- 
ception of education became the prevailing type, the school 
remained under church control until after the founding of 
our national government. In New England, however, and 
the New England evolution in time became the prevailing 
American practice, the school passed through a very inter- 
esting development during colonial times from a church into 
a state school. 
As we have seen, each little New England town was origi- 
nally established as a religious republic, with the Church in 
complete control. The governing authorities for church 
and civil affairs were much the same. When acting as church 
officers they were known as Elders and Deacons; when act- 
ingas civil or town officers they were known as Selectmen. 
The State, as represented in the colony legislature or the 
town meeting, was clearly the servant of the Church, and 
existed in large part for religious ends. It was the State 
acting as the servant of the Church which enacted the
-P-A-G-E-65
  
BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION 45 
laws of 1642 and 1647, requiring the towns to maintain 
schools for religious purposes. Now, so close was the con- 
nection between the religious town which controlled church 
affairs, and the civil town which looked after roads, fences, 
taxes, and defense — the constituency of both being one and 
the same, and the meetings of both being held at first in the 
Meeting-House — that when the schools were established 
the colony legislature placed them under the civil, as in- 
volving taxes and being a public service, rather than under 
the religious town. The interests of one were the interests 
of both, and, being the same in constituency and territorial 
boundaries, there seemed no occasion for friction or fear. 
From this religious beginning the civil school, and the civil 
school town and township, with all our elaborate school 
administrative machinery, were later evolved. 
The erection of a town hall, separate from the meeting- 
house, was the first step in the process. School affairs were 
now discussed at the town hall, instead of in the church. 
Town taxes, instead of church taxes, were voted for buildings 
and maintenance. The minister continued to certificate 
the grammar-school master until the close of the colonial 
period, but the power to certificate the elementary-school 
teachers passed to the town authorities early in the eight- 
eenth century. By the close of this century all that the 
minister, as the surviving representative of church con- 
trol, had left to him was the right to accompany the town 
authorities in the visitation of the schools. Thus gradu- 
ally but certainly did the earlier religious school pass out 
from under the control of the Church and become a state 
school. When our national government and the different 
state governments were established, the States were’ ready 
to accept, in principle at least, the theory gradually worked 
out in New England that schools are state institutions and 
should be under the control of the State. 
European traditions no longer satisfy. The changes in 
the character and in the administration of the schools alike 
reflect the spirit of the times, which was one of rising in- 
   
-P-A-G-E-66
46 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
dividualism in both Europe and America. By 1750 it is 
clearly evident that European traditions and ways and man- 
ners and social customs and types of schools were no longer 
completely satisfactory. There is clearly manifest a desire 
to modify all these various forces so as to adapt them better 
to purely American needs. There is also. a tendency, 
strongly marked in the South, to discard schools for all but 
a few as being unnecessary under new-world conditions. 
The growing exasperation with the mother country for her 
foolish colonial policy tended to emphasize this feeling of 
independence, while Braddock’s defeat, after his insulting 
boastfulness, had a great effect in giving the people of all the 
colonies a new c i ir_abilt them- 
selves. 
The evolution of the public or state school in New Eng- 
land from the original religious school; the formation gener- 
ally of the American common school; the rise of the district 
system; the introduction of new types of textbooks; the de- 
cline of the Latin grammar schools; the rise of the essen- 
tially American Academy; the establishment of two new 
colleges (Pennsylvania, 1749; Kings, 1754), which from the 
first placed themselves in sympathy with the more practical 
studies; and the abandonment by Yale in 1767 and Harvard 
in 1773 of the practice of listing the students in the Catalogue 
according to the rank and social standing of their parents; 
— all these were clear indications that the end of the colonial 
period marked the abandonment of the transplanting of 
English educational ideas and schools and types of instruc- 
tion. Instead, the beginnings of the evolution of distinc- 
tively American types of schools, better adapted to Ameri- 
can needs, are clearly evident. This evolution was checked 
by the war which closed the period of colonial depend- 
ence, and something like half a century of our national life 
passed before we note again the rise of a distinctively 
American educational consciousness and the development 
of distinctively American schools once more begins.

CHAPTER III 
EARLY NATIONAL AND STATE ATTITUDES 
(1775-1825) 
I. Tae NationaL GovERNMENT AND EDUCATION 
Effect of the war on education. The effect of the War for 
Independence, on all types of schools, was disastrous. The 
growing troubles with the mother country had, for more 
than a decade previous to the opening of hostilities, tended 
to concentrate attention on other matters than schooling. 
Political discussion and agitation had largely monopolized 
the thinking of the time. 
With the outbreak of the war education everywhere suf- 
fered seriously. Most of the rural and parochial schools 
closed, or continued a more or less intermittent existence. 
In some of the cities and towns, the private and charity 
schools continued to operate, but in others they were closed 
entirely. Usually the charity schools closed first, the private 
pay schools being able to keep open longest. In New York 
City, then the second largest city in the country, practically 
all schools closed with British occupancy and remained closed 
until after the end of the war. The Latin grammar schools 
and academies often closed from lack of pupils, while the 
colleges were almost deserted. Harvard and Kings, in par- 
ticular, suffered grievously, and sacrificed much for the cause 
of liberty. The war engrossed the energies and the resources 
of the peoples of the different colonies, and schools, never 
very securely placed in the affections of the people, outside 
of New England, were allowed to fall into decay or entirely 
disappear. The period of the Revolution and the period 
of reorganization which followed, up to the beginning of our 
national government (1775-1789), were together a time of 
rapid decline in educational advantages and increasing illit-

eracy among the people. Meager as had been the oppor- 
tunities for schooling before 1775, the opportunities by 1790, 
except in a few cities and in the New England districts, had 
shrunk almost to the vanishing point. 
The close of the war found the country both impoverished 
and exhausted. All the colonies had made heavy sacrifices, 
many had been overrun by hostile armies, and the debt of 
the Union and of the States was so great that many thought 
it could never be paid. The thirteen States, individually 
and collectively, with only 3,380,000 people, had incurred an 
indebtedness of $75,000,000 for the prosecution of the con- 
flict. Commerce was dead, the government of the Confeder- 
ation was impotent, petty insurrections were common, the 
States were quarreling continually with one another over 
all kinds of trivial matters, England still remained more or 
less hostile, and foreign complications began to appear. It 
seemed as if the colonies, having united to obtain political 
liberty, might now lose it through quarreling among them- 
selves. The period from the surrender of Cornwallis at 
Yorktown, in 1781, to the adoption of the Constitution and 
the inauguration of the new government, in 1789, was a very 
critical period in American history. That during such a 
crucial period, and for some years following, but little or no 
attention was anywhere given to the question of education 
was only natural. 
The Constitution does not mention education. The new 
Constitution for the Union, as framed by the Constitutional 
Convention, nowhere contains any mention of any form of 
education, and a search of the debates of the Convention 
reveals that only once was anything relating to education 
brought before that body. Even then it was but a question, 
answered by the chairman, and related to the power under 
the new Constitution to establish a national university at 
the seat of government. The chair ruled that the new 
government would have such power. Were the Constitu- 
tion to be reframed to-day there is little doubt but that 
education would occupy a prominent place in it.
-P-A-G-E-73
EARLY NATIONAL AND STATE ATTITUDES 53 
It is not surprising, however, when we consider the time, 
the men, and the existing conditions, that the founders of 
our Republic did not deem the subject of public education 
important enough to warrant consideration in the Conven- 
tion or inclusion in the document. Education almost every- 
where was still a private matter, and quite generally under 
the control of the Church. The New England colonies had 
formed a notable exception to the common practice, both 
in this country and abroad. 
Everywhere in Catholic countries education as an af- 
fair of the State had not been thought of. In France ele- 
mentary education had been left to the Brothers of the 
Christian Schools, and secondary education to the Jesuits. 
In 1792 the Brothers of the Christian Schools, after over a 
century of effort, had but 121 teaching communities in all 
France, about 1000 teaching brothers, and approximately 
86,000 pupils enrolled, out of an estimated total population 
of 26,000,000, or about 1 child in each 150 of the population. 
In England education had, since the days of Elizabeth, been 
considered as “no business of the State,” and the great 
nineteenth-century agitation for state schools had not as 
yet been started. Even in Scotland, where schools were 
opened generally in the church parishes following the Ref- 
ormation there, and had continued to be well maintained, 
they were church and not state schools. Only in the larger 
German Protestant States had education been declared a 
state function and subject to state supervision, but even in 
these States the schools were still partially under church 
control, through the pastors of the churches being appointed 
school inspectors and superintendents for the State. 
Even the theory of education, aside from that relating to 
instruction in Latin secondary schools and colleges, had not 
been thought out and formulated at the time the Constitu- 
tion was framed. Pestalozzi had not as yet done his great 
work in Switzerland, or written out his ideas as to the nature 
of elementary education. Herbart was a small child at the 
time, and Froebel a mere infant in arms. Herbert Spencer

54 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
was not born for more than a quarter of a century after- 
ward. ; 
Again, it must be remembered that the Constitutional 
Convention embraced in its membership the foremost men 
of colonial times. Practically every one of them was a prod- 
uct of the old aristocratic and private type of tuition train- 
ing, and probably few had any particular sympathy with 
the attempts at general education made by the charity- 
school type of instruction provided by the churches, or with 
the indifferent type of teachers found in most of the pay 
schools before 1775. The Convention, too, it must be re- 
membered, had weighty problems of State to find a solution 
for, serious differences between the States to reconcile, and 
important compromises to work out and make effective. Its 
great task was to establish a stable government for the new 
States, and in doing this all minor problems were left to the 
future for solution. One of these was education in all its 
forms, and accordingly no mention of education occurs in 
the document. 
By the tenth amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 
1791, which provided that “powers not delegated to the 
United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to 
the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to 
the people,” the control of schools and education passed, 
as one of the unmentioned powers thus reserved, to the 
_ people of the different States to handle in any manner which 
they saw fit. 
How the Constitution helped solve the religious question. 
A reference to Figure 2 (page 14) will show that this Na- 
tion was settled by a large number of different religious 
sects, and this number was further increased with time. 
While the colonies were predominantly Protestant, these 
Protestant sects differed greatly among themselves, and 
between them there was often as bitter rivalry as between 
Protestants and Catholics. This was almost as true of their 
schools as of their churches. At the beginning of the War of 
Independence the Anglican (Episcopal) faith had been de-
-P-A-G-E-75
  EARLY NATIONAL AND STATE ATTITUDES = 55 
clared “the established religion” of the seven English colo- 
nies, and the Congregational was the established religion in 
three of the New England colonies, while but three colonies 
had declared for religious freedom and refused to give a 
state preference to any religion. Catholics in particular 
were under the ban, they not being allowed to vote or 
hold religious services except in Pennsylvania and Ma 
land. 
This religious problem had to be met by the Constitu- 
tional Convention, and it handled it in the only way it could 
have been intelligently handled in a nation composed of 
so many different religious sects as was ours. The solution 
worked out was both revolutionary and wholesome. It 
simply incorporated into the Constitution provisions which 
guaranteed the free exercise of their religious faith to all, 
and forbade the establishment by Congress of any state 
religion, or the requirement of any religious test or oath as 
a prerequisite for holding any office under the control of 
the Federal Government. We thus took a stand for reli- 
gious freedom at a time when the hatreds of the Reforma- 
tion still burned fiercely, and when tolerance in religious 
matters was as yet but little known. , 
Importance of the solution arrived at. The far-reach- 
ing importance for our future national life of these sane pro- 
visions, and especially their importance for the future of 
public education, can hardly be overestimated. This ac- 
tion led to the early abandonment of state religions, reli- 
gious tests, and public taxation for religion in the old States, 
and to the prohibition of these in the new. It also laid the 
foundations upon which our systems of free, common, pub- 
lic, tax-supported, non-sectarian schools have since been 
built up. How we ever could have erected a common public 
school system on a religious basis, with the many religious 
sects among us, it is impossile to conceive. Instead, we 
should have had a series of feeble, jealous, antagonistic, and 
utterly inefficient church school systems, confined chiefly to 
elementary education, and each largely intent on teaching 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
56 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
its peculiar church doctrines and struggling for an increasing 
. share of public funds. 
How much we as a people owe the Fathers of our Re- 
public for this most intelligent provision few who have not 
thought carefully on the matter can appreciate. To it we 
must trace not only the almost inestimable blessing of re- 
ligious liberty, which we have for so long enjoyed, but also 
the final establishment of our common, free, public school 
systems. It still required a half century of struggle with 
the churches to break their strangle hold on the schools and 
to create really public schools, but the beginning of the 
emancipation of education from church domination goes 
back to this wise provision inserted in our National Con- 
stitution. 
The new motive for education. Up to near the time of 
the outbreak of the War for Independence there had been 
but one real motive for maintaining schools — the religious. 
To be sure, this had clearly begun to wane by 1750, but it 
still continued to be the dominant motive. The Declara- 
tion of Independence had asserted that “all men are created 
equal,” that “they are endowed by their Creator with cer- 
tain inalienable rights,” and that “to secure these rights 
Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just 
powers from the consent of the governed.”” The long struggle 
for independence, with its sacrifice and hardships, had tended 
to clinch firmly this belief among the colonists, and the new 
Constitution, with its extension of the right to vote for 
national officers to a largely increased number of male citi- 
zens, had carried the theory expressed in the Declaration 
of Independence over into practice. By 1830 most States 
had abolished property qualifications for voting, and general 
manhood suffrage was a concrete reality. These new politi- 
cal beliefs tended to create a new political motive for educa- 
tion, which was destined to grow in importance and in time 
entirely supersede the old religious motive. 
At first those responsible for the government in the States 
and the Nation were too busy with problems of organization,
-P-A-G-E-77
  
EARLY NATIONAL AND STATE ATTITUDES 57 
finance, and order to think much of other things, but soon 
after a partial measure of these had been established we 
find the leading statesmen of the time beginning to express 
themselves as to the need for general education in a govern- 
ment such as ours. Jefferson, writing to James Madison 
from Paris, as early as 1787, had said: 
Above all things, I hope the education of the common people 
will be attended to; convinced that on this good sense we may rely 
with the most security for the preservation of a due degree of 
liberty. 
Writing from Monticello to Colonel Yancey, after his re- 
tirement from the presidency, in 1816, Jefferson again said: 
If a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civiliza- 
tion it expects what never was and never will be. .. . There is no 
safe deposit [for the functions of government], but with the people 
themselves; nor can they be safe with them without information. 
In his Farewell Address to the American people, written 
in 1796, Washington said: 
Promote then, as an object of primary importance, institutions 
for the general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the 
structure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is essen- 
tial that public opinion should be enlightened. 
John Jay, first Chief Justice of the United States, in a 
letter to his friend, Dr. Benjamin Rush, wrote: 
I consider knowledge to be the soul of a Republic, and as the 
weak and the wicked are generally in alliance, as much care should 
be taken to diminish the number of the former as of the latter. 
Education is the way to do this, and nothing should be left undone 
to afford all ranks of people the means of obtaining a proper 
degree of it at a cheap and easy rate. 
James Madison, fourth president of the United States, 
wrote: 
A satisfactory plan for primary education is certainly a vital 
desideratum in our republics. 
A popular government without popular information or the 
ameans of acquiring it is but @ prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or,
-P-A-G-E-78
    58 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
perhaps, both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance; and a 
people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves 
with the power which knowledge gives. 
John Adams, with true New England thoroughness, ex- 
pressed the new motive for education still more forcibly 
when he wrote: 
The instruction of the people in every kind of knowledge that 
can be of use to them in the practice of their moral duties as men, 
citizens, and Christians, and of their political and civil duties as 
members of society and freemen, ought to be the care of the public, 
and of all who have any share in the conduct of its affairs, in a man- 
ner that never yet has been practiced in any age or nation. The 
education here intended is not merely that of the children of the rich 
and noble, but of every rank and class of people, down to the lowest 
and the poorest. It is not too much to say that schools for the 
education of all should be placed at convenient distances and main- 
tained at the public expense. The revenues of the State. would be 
applied infinitely better, more charitably, wisely, usefully, and 
therefore politically in this way than even in maintaining the poor. 
This would be the best way of preventing the existence of the 
Poor... 
Laws for the liberal education of youth, especially of the lower 
classes of people, are so extremely wise and useful that, to a 
humane and generous mind, no expense for this purpose would be 
thought extravagant. 
Having founded, as Lincoln so well said later at Gettys- 
burg, “on this continent a new Nation, conceived in liberty, 
and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created 
equal,” and having built a constitutional form of govern- 
ment based on that equality, it in time became evident to 
those who thought at all on the question that that liberty 
and political equality could not be preserved without the 
general-education ofall. A new motive for education was 
thus created and gradually formulated, and the nature of 
school instruction came in time to be colored through and 
through by this new political motive. The necessary schools, 
however, did not come at once. On the contrary, the struggle 
to establish that general education required the best efforts
-P-A-G-E-79
  
  EARLY NATIONAL AND STATE ATTITUDES 59 
of those interested in the highest welfare of the Republic 
for more than a half-century to come. 
Beginnings of national aid for education. By cessions 
made by the original States, the new National Government 
was given title to all the lands lying between the Alleghenies 
and the Mississippi River. This it was agreed was to con- 
stitute a great National Domain, from which future States 
might be carved. The Revolutionary War had hardly 
ceased before a stream of soldiers and other immigrants 
began to pour into this new territory. These people de- 
manded to be permitted to pur- 
chase the land, but before it 
could be sold it must be sur- 
veyed. Accordingly Congress 
adopted a rectangular form of 
land survey, under which the 
new territory was laid out into 
“Congressional Townships,” six 
miles square. Each township 
was in turn subdivided into sec- 
tions one mile square, and into 
quarter sections, and a regular Fie. Le ConeemaiOeN 
system of numbering for each showing numbering and location of 
was begun. In adopting the ‘tion 16. ‘ 
Ordinance for the government of that part of the territory 
lying north of the Ohio, in 1787, Congress provided that 
“Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good 
government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the 
means of education shall be forever encouraged” in the 
States to be formed from this territory. This provision, 
and the ultimate settlement of the territory largely by peo- 
ple of New England stock, settled the future attitude as to 
public education of the States eventually erected therefrom. 
When the first State came to be admitted, Ohio, in 1802, 
the question arose as to the right of the new State to tax 
the public lands of the United States. By way of settling 
this question amicably Congress offered to the new State

60 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
that if it would agree not to tax the lands of the United 
States, and the same when sold for five years after_sale (the 
purchase price usually being paid in five annual installments), 
the United States would in turn give to the new State the 
sixteenth section of land.in every township for the mainte- 
nance of schools within the township. The offer was ac- 
cepted, and was continued in the case of every new State 
admitted thereafter, except Texas, which owned its own 
land when admitted, and West Virginia and Maine, which 
were carved from original States. With the admission of 
California, in 1850, the grant was raised to two sections in 
each township, the sixteenth and the thirty-sixth, and all 
States since admitted have received two sections in each 
township for schools. In the admission of Utah, Arizona, 
and New Mexico, due‘to the low value of much of the land, 
four sections were granted to each of these States. To 
these section grants some other lands were later added, — 
saline lands, swamp lands, and lands for internal improve- 
ments, and these constitute the National Land Grants for 
the endowment of public education, and form the basis of 
the permanent school funds in all the States west of the 
Alleghenies. In all, the national government has given to 
the States for common schools, in these section and other 
grants, a total of approximately 132,000,000 acres of public 
lands. This, at the traditional government price of $1.25 
an acre, would constitute a gift for the endowment of com- 
mon school education in the different States of approxi- 
mately $165,000,000. Asa matter of fact, due to the better 
care taken of their lands by the newer Western States, and 
the higher prices for more recent sales, these grants will 
produce at least half a billion dollars for educational en- 
dowment. 
These gifts by Congress to the new States of national 
lands for the endowment of public education, though begun 
in large part as a land-selling proposition, helped greatly 
in the early days to create a sentiment for state schools, 
stimulated the older States to set aside lands and moneys
-P-A-G-E-81

to create state school funds of their own, and did much to 
enable the new States to found state school systems instead 
of copying the parochial charity schools of the older 
States to the east. “YOON 
II. Waar THe State: RE DOING 
Education having been left to the States as an unmen- 
tioned power by the tenth amendment to the Federal Con- 
stitution, we next turn to the different States to see what 
action was taken by them in the matter of education dur- 
ing the early years of our national history. In doing so 
we need to examine both the state constitutions which they 
framed, and their early educational legislation. 
The early state constitutions. During the period from 
the adoption of the Declaration of Independence to the 
close of the eighteenth century (1776-1800), all the States, 
except Rhode Island and Connecticut, which considered 
their colonial charters as satisfactory, formulated and 
adopted new state constitutions. A number of the States 
also amended or revised their constitutions one or more 
times during this period. Three new States also were ad- 
mitted before 1800 — Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee. 
Some idea of the importance attached to general education 
by the early States may be gained by an examination of 
these early state constitutions. 
Of these, the state constitutions of New Hampshire, New 
Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina, 
all framed in 1776; New York, framed in 1777; South Caro- 
lina, revised in 1778 and again in 1790; Kentucky, framed 
in 1792, and revised in 1799; and Tennessee, framed in 1796 
—all, were equally silent on the matter of schools and edu- 
cation. New Hampshire and Delaware, in later revisions, 
included a brief section on the subject. Maryland amended 
its constitution four times, before 1864, without including 
any mention of education. Of the sixteen States forming 
the Union in 1800, nine had by that time made o.mention 
of education in any of their constitutions.
-P-A-G-E-82
62° EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
The constitutions of the seven States which had made 
some mention fall into three classes. The first, represented 
by Delaware and the first Georgia constitution, merely 
briefly direct the establishment of schools; the second, repre- 
sented by Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont, 
have good sections directing the encouragement of learning 
and virtue and the protection and encouragement of school 
societies; while the third, represented by North Carolina 
and the first Pennsylvania and Vermont constitutions, direct 
the establishment of schools where tuition shall be cheap. In 
its second constitution Pennsylvania went over completely 
to the maintenance of a pauper-school system. A few ex- 
tracts will illustrate theseearly state constitutional provisions. 
Delaware made no mention of education in its first (1776) 
constitution, but in its second (1792) very briefly directed 
the Legislature, when it saw fit, to provide schools, as may 
be seen from the following section: 
Art. VIII, Sec. 12. The Legislature shall, as soon as conven- 
iently may be, provide by law for... establishing schools, and 
promoting arts and sciences. 
Georgia had given somewhat similar directions as to schools 
in 1777, but in 1798 withdrew these directions and substi- 
tuted a section relating only to the promotion of arts and 
sciences in seminaries of learning, and directed the Legisla- 
ture to protect the endowment funds of such. 
Massachusetts and New Hampshire, in almost identical 
words, gave the most complete directions of any States as to 
the encouragement of learning and private school societies, 
and the establishment of schools, and Massachusetts in- 
cluded a long article making detailed provisions for the pro- 
tection and maintenance of Harvard College. Of the eight 
other colleges in the colonies at the beginning of the War 
of Independence, no other State made any constitutional 
mention regarding them. The Massachusetts and New 
Hampshire provisions for the encouragement of learning are 
so excellent, and so much ahead of the general conception 
   
-P-A-G-E-83
EARLY NATIONAL AND STATE ATTITUDES 63 
of the time, that the Massachusetts provision, which was 
later copied by New Hampshire, is worth quoting in full. 
Chap. V, Sec. 2. Wisdom and knowledge, as well as virtue, 
diffused generally among the body of the people, being necessary 
for the preservation of their rights and liberties; and as these 
depend on spreading the opportunities and advantages of educa- 
tion in the various parts of the country, and among the different 
orders of the people, it shall be the duty of the legislatures and 
magistrates, in all future periods of this Commonwealth, to cherish 
the interests of literature and the sciences, and all seminaries of 
them; especially the university at Cambridge, public schools, 
and grammar schools in the towns; to encourage private societies 
and public institutions, by rewards and immunities, for the promo- 
tion of agriculture, arts, sciences, commerce, trades, manufactures, 
and a natural history of the country; to countenance and inculcate 
the principles of humanity and general benevolence, public and 
private charity, industry and frugality, honesty and punctuality 
in their dealings; sincerity, good humor, and all social affections 
and generous sentiments among the people. 
Vermont, in its first constitution (1777), directed the es- 
tablishment of schools in each town “with such salaries to 
the masters, paid by the town” as would “enable them to 
instruct youth at low prices,” and also directed the estab- 
lishment of a grammar school in each county, and a univer- 
sity for the State. North Carolina, in its constitution of 
the preceding year, had inserted a similar provision for low- 
priced instruction, and for the creation of a state univer- 
sity. In a supplemental section Vermont also directed the 
encouragement of learning and private school societies, 
somewhat after the Massachusetts example. In the revi- 
sion of 1787, all was omitted from the Vermont constitu- 
tion except the supplemental section. 
Pennsylvania, in its constitution of 1776, directed the es- 
tablishment of a school in each county, “with such salaries 
to the masters, paid by the public, as may enable them 
to instruct youth at low prices”; directed the encourage- 
ment of learning in one or more universities; and then added 
a supplemental section, as had Vermont, directing the en- 
 
-P-A-G-E-84

64 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
couragement of learning and school societies. In the re- 
vision of 1790 all this was abandoned for the following 
brief and indefinite directions for the establishment of a 
pauper-school system: 
Sec. 1. The legislature shall, as soon as conveniently may be, 
provide, by law, for the establishment of schools throughout the 
State, in such manner that the poor may be taught gratis. 
Sec. 2. The arts and sciences shall be promoted in one or more 
seminaries of learning. 
These constitutional provisions represent the mandates re- 
lating to public education which seven early States thought 
desirable or necessary. Compared with a modern Western 
State constitution the mention of education made in them 
seems very hesitating and feeble. As in the earlier period 
of American education, it was Calvinistic New England 
which provided the best constitutional provisions for learn- 
ing. On the other hand, it was the old Anglican Church 
colonies and the new States of Kentucky and Tennessee 
which were silent on the subject. 
The early state school laws. Turning next to the early 
state laws regarding schools, we find in them a still better 
index as to state interest in and effort for general education. 
Examining the legislation relating to the establishment of 
public schools which was enacted before 1820, and omitting 
legislation relating to colleges and academies, we find that 
the sixteen States in the Union before 1800 classify them- 
selves into three main groups, as follows: 
1. The good-school-conditions grovip. 
Vermont Connecticut 
New Hampshire New York 
Massachusetts

3. The no-action group. 
Rhode Island Kentucky 
North Carolina Tennessee 
South Carolina 
The good-school-conditions group. It is the four New 
England States, settled originally by Calvinistic Puritans, 
and the State of New York, which by 1810 had become vir- 
tually a westward extension of New England by reason of 
the settlement of all central New York by New England 
people (see Fig. 14), which early made the best provisions 
for schools. Beside supporting the three colony colleges, 
Dartmouth, Harvard, and Yale, and maintaining grammar 
schools and academies, the laws made, for the time, good 
provisions for elementary education. Summarized briefly 
by States the laws enacted provided as follows: 
Vermont. First general state school law in 1782. District sys- 
tem authorized. Support of schools by district tax or rate bill on 
parents optional. State aid granted. 1797 — Districts failing to 
provide schools to receive no state assistance. Reading, writing, 
and arithmetic to be taught in all schools. 1810 — Town school 
tax obligatory, and gradually increased from 1 per cent to 3 per 
cent by 1826. 1825 — State school fund created. 1827— New 
school law required towns to build school buildings; required 
certificates of teachers; made the beginnings of school supervision; 
and added spelling, grammar, history, geography, and good be- 
havior to the list of required school subjects. 
New Hampshire. First general state school law in 1789. Town 
tax required, and rate fixed; teachers’ certificates required; Eng- 
lish schools and Latin schools required in the larger towns. 1791 
— Town taxes for schools increased. 1821 — State school fund 
created. 1827 — Poor children to be provided with schoolbooks 
free. 
Massachusetts. First general state school law in 1789. This 
legalized the practices in education of the past hundred and fifty 
years, and changed them into state requirements. A six-months 
elementary school required in every town, and twelve-months if 
having 100 families. Also a six-months grammar school required 
of every town having 150 families, and twelve-months if 200 fam- 
ilies. All teachers to be certificated, and all grammar school

teachers to be college graduates or certificated by the minister as 
skilled in Latin. ‘These laws also applied to Maine, which was a 
part of Massachusetts until 1820. 
Connecticut. Laws of 1700 and 1712 required all parishes or 
school societies operating schools to maintain an elementary 
school for from six to eleven months a year, varying with the size 
of the parish. Law of 1714 required inspection of schools and 
teachers. These laws continued in force by the new State. A 
permanent school fund had been created in 1750 by the sale of some 
Connecticut lands, and in 1795, on the sale of the Western Reserve 
in Ohio for $1,200,000. ‘This was added to the permanent school 
fund. 1798 — School visitors and overseers ordered appointed. 
New York. Little of an educational nature had been done in this 
State before the Revolution, except in the matter of church charity 
schools. In 1795 a law, valid for five years, was enacted which 
distributed $100,000 a year to the counties for schools. By 1798 
there were 1352 schools in 16 of the 23 counties, and 59,660 chil- 
dren were enrolled. On the expiration of the law, in 1800, it could 
not be reénacted. By 1812, when the first permanent school law 
was enacted, New England immigration into the State had coun- 
ter balanced the private-parochial-charity-school attitude of New 
York City. The Massachusetts district system was instituted, 
local taxation required, state aid distributed on the basis of school 
census, and the first State Superintendent of Schools provided for. 
In 1814 teachers were ordered examined. By 1820 New York 
schools probably the best of any State in the Union. 
The pauper-parochial-school group. The six States of 
this group are the old middle colonies, where the parochial- 
school and the pauper-school attitudes, described under 
Chapter II, had been most prominent, and one Southern 
State. The idea had become so fixed in these middle colonies 
that education belonged to the Church and to charitable 
organizations that any interference by the State, beyond as- 
sisting in the maintenance of pauper schools, came in time 
to be bitterly resented. Briefly summarized, by States, 
the legislation enacted provided as follows: 
Pennsylvania. The constitution of 1776 had directed the estab- 
lishment of a school in each county, where youths should be taught 
at low prices, but the constitution of 1790 had directed instead the
-P-A-G-E-88
ee Soe ae se Ne eR 
68 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
establishment, at the convenience of the legislature, of a series of 
pauper schools. The first law was in 1802, and this provided only 
for the education of the pauper children in each county. In 1824 
a better law was enacted, but its acceptance was optional, and in 
1826 it was repealed and the pauper-school law of 1802 continued. 
The first free-school law dates from 1834. Even this was optional, 
and was at first accepted by but little more than half of the school 
districts in the State. 
Delaware. In 1796 a state school fund was created from the pro- 
ceeds of tavern and marriage licenses. This accumulated unused 
until 1817, when $1000 a year was appropriated from the income 
to each of the three counties for the instruction of the children of 
the poor in reading, writing, and arithmetic. In 1821 aid was 
extended to Sunday Schools. In 1821 a so-called free-school law 
was enacted, by which the State duplicated amounts raised by 
subscription or contribution, but by 1833 only 183 districts in the 
State were operating under the law. The schools of Wilmington 
date from 1821. In 1843 an educational convention adopted a 
resolution opposing taxation for free schools. First real school 
law in 1861. 
Maryland. No constitutional mention until 1864. Many 
academies chartered, and lotteries much used for their aid between 
1801 and 1817. 1812— School fund begun by a tax on banks. 
1816 — First property tax to aid schools for the poor. 1826 — 
First general school law, but acceptance optional with the counties; 
too advanced and never in operation, except in Baltimore. No 
school system until after the Civil War. 
Virginia. The efforts of Jefferson to establish a complete school 
system for the State failed. 1796 — Optional school law, but little 
done under it. 1810 — Permanent school fund started. 1818 — 
Law providing for a charity school system enacted. By 1843 es- 
timated that half the indigent children in the State were receiving 
sixty days schooling. 1846 — Better school law enacted, but 
optional, and only nine counties ever used it. 1870 — First real 
school law. 
New Jersey. This State might also be classed in the no-action 
group. Nothing was done until 1816, when a state school fund 
was begun. In 1820 permission to levy a local tax for schools was 
granted. In 1828 a report showed that one third of the children 
of the State were growing up without a chance for any education. 
Largely in consequence of this the first general school law was
-P-A-G-E-89
  
EARLY NATIONAL AND STATE ATTITUDES 69 
enacted, in 1829, but the next year this was repealed, as a result 
of bitter opposition from the private and church-school interests, 
and the State followed Pennsylvania’s example and went over to 
the pauper-school idea of state action. In 1830 and 1831 laws 
limited state educational effort to aiding schools for the education 
of the children of the poor. In 1838 the beginnings of a state public 
school system were made, and in 1844 state aid was limited to 
public schools. First constitutional mention of education in 1844. 
Georgia. In 1817 a fund of $250,000 was created for free schools. 
Schools for poor children were opened in Savannah in 1818, and 
Augusta in 1821. 1822— Income of fund appropriated to pay 
tuition of poor children. 1837 — Free school system established, 
but law repealed in 1840. 1858 — Word “poor” eliminated from 
law. Real state school system dates from after Civil War. 
The no-action group. This group contains the reli- 
gious-freedom state of Rhode Island, two of the States which 
were for long imbued with the Anglican “no-business-of- 
the-State” attitude, and the two new States of Tennessee 
and Kentucky, settled largely by “poor whites” and others 
from the Carolinas and Virginia. Examining the legisla- 
tion, or rather lack of legislation in these States, we find 
the following: 
Rhode Island. First constitutional mention in 1842. The first 
school law for the colony was enacted in 1800, at the instance of 
a group of citizens of Providence. Schools were ordered estab- 
lished in every town in the State for instruction in reading, writing, 
and arithmetic, and some state aid was given. Providence and 
other towns established schools, and so great was the opposition 
to the law that it was repealed in 1803. In 1825 Newport was per- 
mitted to start schools for its poor children. It was not until 1828 
that a permissive state school Jaw was enacted, and by 1831 there 
were only 328 public schools and 375 public teachers in the State. 
North Carolina. A School Society for the education of females 
was chartered in 1811. In 1816 legislature appointed a commission 
to report a school law. 1817— Good plan reported, but legisla- 
ture would not approve. 1824— Another commission appointed. 
1825 — Reported a bill for a pauper-school system, which also 
was not approved. 1825 — Permanent state school fund begun. 
1839 — First bill creating an elementary school system.
-P-A-G-E-90

South Carolina. In 1811 Charleston permitted to organize 
charity schools. 1836— Report made recommending a state 
system of charity schools; not adopted. 1854 — Charleston peti- 
tioned to be permitted to make its schools free; granted in 1856. 
State school system dates from after the Civil War. 
Kentucky. First provision for aid for common schools in 1821, 
but legislature diverted funds. 1830 — First general school law; 
dead letter, largely through lack of any interest in schools. 1853 
— School in each county for first time. 
Tennessee. First school law in 1830, establishing the district 
system, and schools open to all.

been summarized. From this map it will be seen, even 
better than from the descriptions of constitutional enact- 
ments and early legislation, what an important part reli- 
gion played, with us, in the establishment of a public school 
attitude. It was the Calvinistic-Puritan States of New 
England which most deeply believed in education as _a_ne- 
cessity for salvation, and they so established the school idea 
among their people that this belief in schools persisted after 
the religious motive for education had died out. Spreading 
westward, they carried their belief in education into the new 
States in which they settled. In the middle colonies, where 
the parochial school idea and the plan of apprenticing and 
educating orphans and paupers dominated, we see States 
where all elementary educational effort was turned over to 
private, church, and pauper schools, the State aiding only 
the last, or at most the last two. In the religious-freedom 
State of Rhode Island, and the old Anglican colonies of 
New Jersey and the Carolinas, we see the English “no- 
business-of-the-State” attitude for a time reflected in the 
indifference of the State to education. The four new States 
west of these southern colonies — Kentucky, Tennessee, 
Mississippi, and Alabama — in large part reflected the atti- 
tude of the States td-the eastward f, ich their early 
Of. immigrants came. . = 
The North-West-Territory States. ‘The settlement of the States of the North-West Territory is an interesting ex- 
emplification of the influence on education of the early 
settlements we have so far studied, and much of the early 
educational history of these States is to be understood when 
viewed in the light of their settlement. 
Immediately after the close of the Revolutionary War 
settlers from the different States of the new Union began 
to move to the new territory to the westward. To the 
north, a great movement of New England people began into 
central New York and northern Pennsylvania, and from 
then until 1810, when the tide of immigration turned farther 
westward, the history of these two regions is in large part 
.
-P-A-G-E-92
72 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
the history of the westward expansion of New England. By 
1810 more than one half of New York, one fourth of Penn- 
sylvania, portions of New Jersey, and the Western Reserve 
in Ohio (see map, Fig. 14) had been settled by New England 
people. In New York they counterbalanced the earlier pre- 
dominance of the Anglicans, helped materially in securing 
the first permanent school law for the State, in 1812, and in 
carrying the State for free schools in the referenda of 1849 
and 1850. They also helped to counteract the German 
Lutheran parochial element in the battle for free schools in 
Pennsylvania, in 1834 and 1835. 
After 1810 the tide of migration of New England people 
set in strong to the new States to the west of New York, fol- 
lowing the northern route, and by 1850 one half of the 
settled portions of the old North-West Territory had been 
populated by New England stock, while many settlements 
had been founded beyond the Mississippi River. The his- 
tory of these migrations often repeated the old story of the 
Puritan migrations to New England. Congregations, with 
their ministers, frequently migrated to the West in a body. 
A new Granville, or Plymouth, or Norwalk, or Greenwich 
in the wilderness was a child of the old town of that name 
in New England. An almost ceaseless train of wagons 
poured westward, and the frontier was soon pushed out to 
and beyond the Mississippi. Wherever the New Englander 
went he invariably took his New England institutions with 
him. Congregational churches were established, new Yales 
and Dartmouths founded, common schools and the Massa- 
chusetts district system were introduced, and the town form 
of government and the town meeting were organized in the 
new Congressional townships — a ready-made unit which 
the New Englander found easily adaptable to his ideas of 
town government. 
Into these new States and territories to the westward 
came also other settlers, along the southern route, with dif- 
ferent political, religious, and educational training. Those 
from Pennsylvania came from where town government was

weak, where public free schools had not been developed, 
and where the charity conception of education had for long 
prevailed. Settlers from Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, 
and North Carolina, commonly the descendants of the “poor 
whites” who had not been able to secure land or property or 
to establish themselves there, also moved westward and north- 
ward and settled in the river valleys of the southern and cen- 
tral portions of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. These people 
came from States where slavery and plantation life prevailed, 
where religion, especially for the poor, was by no means a 
vital matter, and where free schools were virtually unknown. 
Mingling of the two classes of people. These two classes 
of people met and struggled for supremacy in Ohio, Indiana, 
and Illinois, and the political, religious, and educational his- 
tory of these States has been determined in large part by the 
preponderance of one or the other of these people. Where 
the New England people were in the ascendancy, as in Ohio, 
and also in Michigan and early Wisconsin, the governmental 
forms were most like New England, and the zeal. for educa- 
tion, religion, and local governmental control have been most 
marked. Where the Southern element predominated, as for 
a time in Illinois, the result has been the opposite. Where 
the two mingled on somewhat even terms, as in Indiana, we 
find a compromise between them. The opening of Missouri 
to slavery, in 1820, deflected the tide of southern migration 
from Indiana and Illinois to that State; and gave the New 
England element a chance to extend its influence over almost 
all the North-West-Territory States. The importance of 
this extension of and conquest by the New England element 
can hardly be overestimated. From these States most of 
the West and Southwest was in turn settled and organized 
into state governments, and to these new regions New Eng: 
land educational ideas in time were spread. 
Educational attitudes in the North-West States. The 
effect of the predominance or mingling of these two classes 
is clearly shown in the early state attitudes toward educa- 
tion, as stated in the constitutions and laws.
-P-A-G-E-95
EARLY NATIONAL STATE AND ATTITUDES 75 
The Ohio constitutional provision of 1802 is noteworthy 
for its strong stand for the encouragement of learning and 
the interdiction of pauper schools in the State, and as re- 
flecting the influence of the national land grants and the 
national attitude regarding religious freedom. It reads: 
Art. VIII, 25. That no law shall be passed to prevent the poor 
in the several counties and townships within the State from an 
equal participation in the schools, academies, colleges, and univer- 
sities within this State, which are endowed, in whole or in part, 
from the revenues arising from the donations made by the United 
States for the support of schools and colleges; and the doors of said 
schools, academies, and universities shall be open for the reception 
of scholars, students, and teachers of every grade, without distinc- 
tion, or preference whatever, contrary to the intent for which said 
donations were made. 
In 1821 a permissive school law was enacted, and in 1825 a 
new school law laid the foundations of a state system, based 
on the Massachusetts district system, county taxation, and 
the certification of teachers. 
The Indiana constitution of 1816 threw safeguards about 
the national land grants for schools, and was the first to issue 
a comprehensive mandate to the legislature ordering the 
establishment of a complete free state system of schools. 
This latter reads: 
Art IX, Sec. 2. It shall be the duty of the general assembly, as 
soon as circumstances will permit, to provide by law for a general 
system of education, ascending in regular gradations from town- 
ship schools to a State university, wherein tuition shall be gratis 
and equally open to all. 
So evenly balanced were the Northern and Southern ele- 
ments in Indiana, however, that this mandate of the consti- 
tution was difficult to carry out, and, despite legislation 
which will be described in Chapter IV, the real beginning of 
a state school system in Indiana dates from 1851. 
Illinois shows the Southern element in control. Neither 
the constitution of 1818 nor the one of 1848 made any men-
-P-A-G-E-96
  76 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
tion of education. A good school law, said to have been 
the best outside of New England, was enacted in 1825, but 
was nullified two years later by legislation which provided 
that no man could be taxed for schools without his written 
consent, and which permitted the maintenance of schools 
in part by tuition fees. It was not until 1841, and after the 
New England people had become a majority, that this 
nullifying legislation of 1827 could be repealed. 
Michigan was not admitted as a State until 1835, but the 
territorial legislature, in 1827, adopted a good school law, 
modeled on the Massachusetts legislation. In 1829 the 
property of non-residents was made subject to taxation 
for schools —at that time rather advanced legislation. 
The first state constitution, of 1835, provided for the ap- 
pointment of the first permanent State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction in any State, and ordered: 
Sec. 3. The legislature shall provide for a system of common 
schools, by which a school shall be kept up and supported in each 
school district at least three months in every year; and any school 
district neglecting to keep up and support such school may be 
deprived of its equal proportion of the interest of the public (school) 
fund. 
Wisconsin was a part of Michigan until 1836, and the 
Michigan legislation applied to Wisconsin territory, In 
1840 the first Wisconsin school law provided for the Mas- 
sachusetts district school system, a school census, and dis- 
trict taxation for schools, and when the State was admitted, 
in 1848, the New England traditions as to education had 
become so firmly fixed, and the new forces working for pop- 
ular education in the State had begun to have such an in- 
fluence, that the school code of 1849 was quite modern in 
character. 
No real educational consciousness before about 1820, 
Regardless of the national land grants for education made 
to the new States, the provisions of the different state con- 
stitutions, the beginnings made here and there in the few 
cities of the time, and the early state laws, we can hardly
-P-A-G-E-97
EARLY NATIONAL AND STATE ATTITUDES 177 
be said, as a people, to have developed an educational con- 
sciousness, outside of New England and New York, before 
about 1820, and in some of the States, especially in the 
South, a state educational consciousness was not awakened 
until very much later. Even in New England there was a 
steady decline in education, as the district system became 
more and more firmly fixed, during the first fifty years of 
our national history. 
There were many reasons in our national life for this lack 
of interest in education among the masses of our people. 
The simple agricultural life of the time, the homogeneity 
of the people, the absence of cities, the isolation and inde- 
pendence of the villages, the lack of full manhood suffrage 
in a number of the States, the want of any economic demand 
for education, and the fact that no important political ques- 
tion calling for settlement at the polls had as yet arisen, 
made the need for schools and learning seem a relatively 
minor one. There were but six cities of 8000 inhabitants 
or over in the country as late as 1810, and even in these life 
was far simpler than in a small Western village to-day. 
There was little need for book learning among the masses 
of the people to enable them to transact the ordinary busi- 
ness of life. A person who could read and write and cipher 
in} that time was an educated man, while the absence of 
these arts was not by any means a matter of reproach. 
The country, too, was still very poor. The Revolutionary 
War debt still hung in part over the Nation, and the demand 
for money and labor for all kinds of internal improvements 
was very large. The country had few industries, and its 
foreign trade was badly hampered by European nations. 
France gave us trouble for a decade, while England made it 
evident that, though we had gained our political independ- 
ence, we should have to fight again if we were to win our 
commercial freedom. Ways and means of strengthening 
the existing government and holding the Union together, 
rather than plans which could bear fruit only in the future, 
occupied the attention of the leaders of the time. “The
-P-A-G-E-98
fe ee eres 
8 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
’ Constitution,” as John Quincy Adams expressed it, “was 
extorted from the grinding necessities of a reluctant people” 
to escape anarchy and the ultimate entire loss of independ- 
ence, and many had grave doubts as to the permanence 
of the Union. It was not until after the close of the War of 
1812 that belief in the stability of the Union and in the ca- 
pacity of the people to govern themselves became the belief 
/of the many rather than the very few, and plans for educa- 
/ tion and national development began to obtain a serious 
hearing. 
When we had finally settled our political and commercial 
future by the War of 1812-14, and had built up a national 
consciousness on a democratic basis in the years immediately 
following, and the Nation at last possessed the energy, the 
money, and the interest for doing so, we then turned our 
energies toward the creation of a democratic system of 
public schools. In the meantime, education, outside of New 
England and in part even there, was left largely to private 
individuals, churches, incorporated school societies, and 
such state schools for the children of the poor as might have 
been provided by private or state funds, or the two com- 
bined. 
The real interest in advanced education. In so far as 
we may be said to have possessed a real interest in educa- 
tion during the first half-century of our national existence, 
it was manifested in the establishment and endowment of 
academies and colleges rather than in the creation of schools 
for the people. The colonial Latin grammar school had 
been almost entirely an English institution, and never well 
suited to American needs. As democratic consciousness 
/ began to arise, the demand came for a more practical insti- 
/ tution, less exclusive and less aristocratic in character, and 
better adapted in its instruction to the needs of a frontier 
society. Arising about the middle of the eighteenth cen- 
tury, a number of so-called Academies had been founded 
before the new National Government took shape. While 
essentially private institutions, arising from a church foun-   
 
-P-A-G-E-99
EARLY NATIONAL AND STATE ATTITUDES 79 
dation, or more commonly a local subscription or endow- 
ment, it became customary for towns, counties, and States 
to assist in their maintenance, thus making them semi- 
public institutions. Their management, though, usually 
remained in private hands, or under boards or associations. 
After the beginning of our national life a number of the 
States founded and endowed a state system of academies. 
Massachusetts, in 1797, granted land endowments to ap- 
proved academies. Georgia, in 1783, created a system of 
county academies for the State. New York extended state 
aid to its academies, in 1813, having put them under state 
inspection as early as 1787. Maryland chartered many 
academies between 1801 and 1817, and authorized many 
lotteries to provide them with funds, as did also North Caro- 
lina: Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana, among Western States, 
also provided for county systems of academies. 
Character of the academy training. The study of Latin 
and a little Greek had constituted the curriculum of the old 
Latin grammar school, and its purpose had been almost ex- 
clusively to prepare boys for admission to the colony col- 
leges. In true English style, Latin was made the language 
of the classroom, and even attempted for the playground as 
well. Asa concession, reading, writing, and arithmetic were 
sometimes taught. The new academies, while retaining the 
study of Latin, and usually Greek, though now taught 
through the medium of English, added a number of new 
studies adapted to the needs of a new society. English 
grammar was introduced and soon rose to a place of great 
importance, as did also oratory and declamation. Arith- 
metic, algebra, geometry, geography, and astronomy were in 
time added, and surveying, rhetoric (including some litera- 
ture), natural and moral philosophy, and Roman antiqui- 
ties were frequently taught. Girls were admitted rather A 
freely to the new academies, whereas the grammar schools a 
had been exclusively for boys. For better instruction a 
‘female department” was frequently organized. The acad- 
emies, beside offering a fair type of higher training before

‘the days of high schools, also became training schools for 
teachers, and before the rise of the normal schools were the 
chief source of supply for the better grade of elementary 
teachers. These institutions rendered an important service 
during the first half of the nineteenth century, but were in 
time displaced by the publicly supported and publicly cqn- 
trolled American high 
schoolhe first of which 
dates from 1821. This 
evolution we shall de- 
scribe more in detail in 
a later chapter. 
The “colleges of the 
time. Some interest also 
was taken in college ed- 
ucation during this early 
national period. Col- 
fi lege attendance, how- York Academy, York, Pennsylvania, founded by the Protestant Episcopal Church, in 1787. ever, was small, as the 
country was still new 
and the people were poor. As late as 1815 Harvard gradu- 
ated a class of but 66; Yale of 69; Princeton of 40; Wil- 
liams of 40; Pennsylvania of 15; and ‘the University of 
South Carolina of 37. After the organization of the Union 
the nine old colonial colleges were reorganized, and an at- 
tempt was made to bring them into closer harmony with the 
ideas and needs of the people and the governments of the 
States. Dartmouth, Kings (now rechristened Columbia), 
and Pennsylvania were for a time changed into state insti- 
tutions, and an unsuccessful attempt was made to make a 
state university for Virginia out of William and Mary. Be- 
tween 1790 and 1825 there was much discussion as to the 
desirability of founding a national university at the seat of 
government, and Washington in his will (1799) left, for that 
time, a considerable sum to the Nation to inaugurate the 
new undertaking. Nothing ever came of it, however. Be- 
fore 1825 six States — Virginia, North Carolina, South

Carolina, Georgia, Indiana, and Michigan — had laid the 
foundations of future state universities. The National Gov- 
ernment had also granted to each new Western State two 
‘entire townships of land to help endow a university in each, 
—a stimulus which eventually led to the establishment of 
a state university in every Western State.

CHAPTER IV 
INFLUENCES TENDING TO AWAKEN AN EDUCATIONAL 
CONSCIOUSNESS 
I. Pamanturoric INFLUENCES 
A half-century of transition. The first half-century of 
our national life may be regarded as a period of transition 
from the church-control idea of education over to the idea of 
education under the control of and supported by the State. 
It required time to make this change in thinking. Up to the 
period of the beginnings of our national development edu- 
cation had almost everywhere been regarded as an affair of 
the Church, somewhat akin to baptism, marriage, the ad- 
ministration of the sacraments, and the burial of the dead. 
Even in New England, which formed an exception, the 
evolution of the civic school from the church school was not 
yet complete. A number of new forces — philanthropic, 
political,.soeial; economic — now combined to produce con- 
ditions which made state rather than church control and 
support of education seem both desirable and feasible. The 
rise of a new national government based on the two new prin- 
ciples of political equality and religious freedom, together 
with the rise of new economic conditions which made some 
education for all seem necessary for economic as well as for 
political ends, changed this age-old situation. 
The church charity school had become, as we have seen, 
a familiar institution before the Revolution. The English 
“Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign 
Parts,” which maintained schools in connection with the 
Anglican churches in the Anglican colonies, and provided an 
excellent grade of charity-school master, withdrew at the 
close of the Revolutionary War from work in this country. 
The different churches after the war continued their efforts 
to maintain their church charity schools, though there was
-P-A-G-E-104
  84 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
for a time a decrease in both their numbers and their effec- 
tiveness. In the meantime the demand for education grew 
rather rapidly, and the task soon became too big for the 
churches to handle. For long the churches made an effort 
to keep up, as they were loath to relinquish in any way their 
former hold on the training of the young. The churches, 
however, were not interested in the problem except in the 
old way, and this was not what the new democracy wanted. 
The result was that, with the coming of nationality and the 
slow but gradual growth of a national consciousness, na- 
tional pride, national needs, and the gradual development 
of national resources in the shape of taxable property, — all 
alike combined to make secular instead of religious schools 
seem both desirable and possible to a constantly increasing 
number of citizens. This change in attitude was facilitated 
by the work of a number of semi-private philanthropic 
agencies, the most important of which were: (1) the Sunday 
School Movement; (2) the growth of City School Societies; 
(3) the Lancastrian Movement; and (4) the coming of the 
Infant-School Societies. These will be described briefly, — 
and their influence in awakening an educational conscious- 
ness pointed out. 
1. The Sunday School Movement 
Secular schools before the religious. One of the earliest 
of these philanthropic movements designed to afford a mini- 
mum of education for the children of the poor was the so- 
called Sunday School Movement. This originated in Eng- 
land shortly after the middle of the seventeenth century, 
but amounted to little until 1780, when a publisher by the 
name of Robert Raikes, of Gloucester, gathered together 
the children in the pin factories of that city and paid four 
women a shilling each to spend their Sundays in instruct- 
ing these poor working children “in reading, and the Church 
catechism.” In 1783 Raikes published a description of the 
plan and its results, and soon the idea spread to many parts 
of England. So successful did the plan prove that in 1785
-P-A-G-E-105
AWAKENING AN EDUCATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS 85 
there was organized “The Society for promoting Sunday 
Schools throughout the British Dominions.” The historian 
Green has declared that “the Sunday Schools established 
by Mr. Raikes were the beginnings of popular education” 
in England. 
aikes’s idea was soon brought to the United States. In 
1786 a Sunday School after the Raikes plan was organized 
in Hanover County, Virginia, at the house of one Thomas 
Crenghaw, and in 1787 a Sunday School for African children 
was organized at Charleston, South Carolina. In 1791 
“The First Day, or Sunday School Society,” was organized 
at Philadelphia, for the establishment of Sunday Schools 
in that city. In 1793 Katy Ferguson’s “School for the 
Poor” was opened in New York, and this was followed by an 
organization of New York women for the extension of secu- 
lar instruction among the poor. In 1797 Samuel Slater’s \_ 
Factory School was opened at Pawtucket, Rhode Island. 
These schools, being open to all instead of only to the poor 
and lowly, had a small but an increasing influence in level- { 
ing class distinctions, and in making a common day school 
seem possible. The movement for secular instruction on 
Sundays, though, soon met in America with the opposition 
of the churches, and before long they took over the idea, 
superseded private initiative and control, and changed the 
character of the instruction from a day of secular work to 
an hour or so of religious teaching. 
Though there had been some Sunday instruction earlier 
at a few places in New England, the introduction of the 
Sunday School from England, in 1786, marks the real be- 
ginning of the religious Sunday School in America. After 
the churches had once caught the idea of a common reli- 
gious school on Sundays for the instruction of any one, a 
number of societies were formed to carry on and extend the 
work. The most important of the earlier foundations were: 
1808. The Evangelical Society of Philadelphia. 
1816. The Female Union for the Promotion of Sabbath Schools 
(New York). / {

1816. The Boston Society for the Moral and Religious Instruc- 
tion of the Poor. 
1817. The Philadelphia Sunday and Adult School Union. 
1824. The American Sunday School Union. 
2. The City School Societies 
Before 1825 a number of subscription societies, many of 
which were able to effect financial connections with the city 
or the State, were formed in the few cities of the time to 
develop schools “for the education of such poor children as 
do not belong to, or are not provided for by any religious 
society.” These societies were usually organized by philan- 
thropic citizens, willing to contribute something yearly to 
provide some little education for a few of the many children 
in the city having no opportunities for any instruction. 
Early New York City societies. One of the first of these 
societies was “The Manumission Society,” organized in 
New York in 1785, for the purpose of “mitigating the evils 
of slavery, to defend the rights of the blacks, and especially 
to give them the elements of an education.” Alexander 
Hamilton and John Jay were among its organizers. A free - 
school for colored pupils was opened, in 1787. This grew 
and prospered and was aided from time to time by the city, 
and in 1801 by the State, and finally, in 1834, all its schools 
were merged with those of the “Public School Society” of 
the city. In 1801 the first free school for poor white children 
“whose parents belong to no religious society, and who, 
from some cause or other, cannot be admitted into any of 
the charity schools of the city,” was opened. This was pro- 
vided by the “Association of Women Friends for the Relief 
of the Poor,” which engaged “‘a widow woman of good edu- 
cation and morals as instructor” at £30 per year. This As- 
sociation also prospered, and received some city or state aid 
up to 1824. By 1823 it was providing free elementary edu- 
cation for 750 children. Its schools also were later merged 
with those of the “Public School Society.”

‘The Public School Society.” Perhaps the most famous 
of all the early subscription societies for the maintenance of 
schools for the poor was the “New York Free School So- - 
_ ciety,” which later changed its name to that of “The Public 
School Society of New York.” This was organized in 1805 
under the leadership of De Witt Clinton, then mayor of the 
city, he heading the subscription list with a promise of 
$200 a year for support. On May 14, 1806, the following 
advertisement appeared in the daily papers: } } 
FREE SCHOOL 
The Trustees of the Society for establishing a Free School in the 
city of New York, for the education of such poor children as do not 
belong to, or are not provided for by any religious Society, having 
engaged a Teacher, and procured a School House for the accommo- 
dation of a School, have now the pleasure of announcing that it is 
proposed to receive scholars of the descriptions alluded to without 
delay; applications may be made to, &c. 
This Society was chartered by the legislature “to provide 
schooling for all children who are the proper objects of a

gratuitous education.” It organized free public education 
in the city, secured funds, built schoolhouses, provided and 
trained teachers, and ably supplemented the work of the 
private and church schools. By its energy and its persist- 
ence it secured for itself a large share of public confidence, 
and aroused a constantly increasing interest in the cause of 
popular education. In 1853, after it had educated over 
600,000 children and trained over 1200 teachers, this Society, 
its work done, surrendered its charter and turned over its 
buildings and equipment to the public school department 
of the city, which had been created by the legislature in 
1842. A 
School Societies elsewhere. The “Benevolent Society. 
of the City of Baltimore for the Education of the Female 
Poor,” founded in 1799, and the “Male Free Society of 
Baltimore,” organized a little later, were two of these early 
school societies, though neither became so famous as the 
Public School Society of New York. From the Annual 
Report of the Baltimore Male Free Society, for 1822, we read: 
It is truly gratifying to the Trustees to witness the increasing 
interest taken in the education of the poor, — to see the talents, 
the zeal, and the means now employed to give instruction to indi- 
gent youth. . . . To the liberality of the citizens of Baltimore, they 
(the poor boys) are indebted for the ample means of instruction 
which they now enjoy. 
The schools of the city of Washington were started by 
subscription, in 1804, and for some time were in part sup- 
ported by subscriptions from public-spirited citizens. 
Thomas Jefferson’s name appears in the first subscription 
list as giving $200, and he was elected a member of the first 
governing board. This was composed of seven citizens ap- 
pointed by the city council, and six elected from among the 
subscribers. The chief sources of support of the schools, 
which up to 1844 remained pauper schools, were subscrip- 
tions lotteries, a tax on slaves and dogs, certain license fees, 
and a small appropriation ($1500) each year from the city 
council. This society did an important work in accustoming 
’ 
   
-P-A-G-E-109
AWAKENING AN EDUCATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS 89 
the people of the capital city to the provision of some form 
of free education. 
In 1800 “The Philadelphia Society for the Free Instruc- 
tion of Indigent Boys” was formed, which a little later 
changed to “The Philadelphia Society for the Establishment 
and Support of Charity Schools.” This organization opened 
the first schools in Philadelphia for children regardless of 
religious affiliation, and for thirty-seven years rendered a 
useful service there. In 1814 “The Society for the Promo- 
tion of a Rational System of Education” was organized in 
Philadelphia, and four years later the public sentiment 
awakened by a combination of the work of this Society and 
the coming of the Lancastrian system of instruction enabled 
the city to secure a special law permitting Philadelphia to 
organize a system of city schools for the education of the 
children of its poor. Other educational societies which 
rendered useful service include the “Mechanics and Manu- 
facturers Association,” of Providence, Rhode Island, or- 
ganized in 1789; “The Albany Lancastrian School Society,” 
organized in 1826, for the education of the poor of the city 
in monitorial schools; and the school societies organized in 
Savannah, in 1818, and Augusta, in 1821, “to afford edu- 
cation to the children of indigent parents.” Both these 
Georgia societies received some support from state funds. 
Another type of free school, of which a number came to 
exist, resulted through establishments by will. Of these the 
gift of John Kidd, a wealthy baker of Cincinnati, who died 
in 1818 and bequeathed $1000 per year “for the education of 
poor children and youths of Cincinnati,” isan example. An- 
other bequest was made to the same city and for the same 
purpose, in 1824, by a citizen named Thomas Hughes. 
The formation of these school societies, the subscriptions 
made by the leading men of the cities, the bequests for edu- 
cation, and the grants of some city and state aid to these 
societies, all of which in time became somewhat common, 
indicate a slowly rising interest in providing schools for the 
education of all. This rising interest in education was 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  90 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
greatly stimulated by the introduction from England of a 
new and what for the time seemed a wonderful system for 
the organization of education, which we next describe. 
3. The Lancastrian monitorial system of instruction 
Origin of the idea. In 1797 Dr. Andrew Bell published in 
England an account of an experiment in education by means 
of monitors, which he had made some years earlier in an 
orphan asylum in Madras, India. About the same time a 
young English schoolmaster, by the name of Joseph Lan- 
caster, was led independently to a similar discovery of the 
advantages of using monitors by reason of his needing assist- 
ance in his school and being too poor to pay for additional 
teachers. The idea attracted attention from the first, and 
was spread rapidly over England, in part by reason of a 
bitter church quarrel between the followers of the two men 
as to which was entitled to credit for originating the system. 
The plans of the two men were much the same. Bell’s 
system was taken up and his claims supported by the Church- 
of-England educational organizations, while Lancaster’s 
was supported by the Dissenters. It was the Lancastrian 
plan which was brought to this country, Church-of-England 
ideas not being in much favor after the Revolution. The 
plan was so cheap, and so effective in teaching reading and 
the fundamentals of religion, that it soon provided England 
with a sort of a substitute for a national system of schools. 
Once introduced into the United States, where the first 
school was opened in New York City, in 1806, the system 
quickly spread from Massachusetts to Georgia, and as far 
west as Cincinnati, Louisville, and Detroit. In 1826 Mary- 
land instituted a state system of Lancastrian schools, with 
a Superintendent of Public Instruction, but in 1828 aban- 
doned the idea and discontinued the office. A state Lan- 
castrian system for North Carolina was proposed in 1832, 
but failed of adoption by the legislature. In 1829 Mexico 
organized higher Lancastrian schools for the Mexican State 
of Texas. In 1818 Lancaster himself came to America, and

was received with much distinction. Most of the remaining 
twenty years of his life were spent in organizing and direct- 
ing schools in various parts of the United States, and in ex- 
pounding the merits of his system. 
Essential features of the plan. The essential features of 
the Lancastrian plan were the collection of a large number 
of pupils in one room, from 200 to 1000 being possible. The 
picture on page 91 shows a monitorial school seating 365. 
The pupils were sorted and seated in rows, and to each 
  Fig. 20. Monttors Teacuine Reaprve 
Three draughts of ten each, with their toes to the semicircles painted on the floor, are being 
taught by monitors from lessons suspended on the wall, 
row was assigned a clever boy who was known as a monitor, 
A common number for each monitor to instruct and look 
after was ten. . The teacher first taught these monitors a 
lesson from a printed card, and then each monitor took 
his row to a “station” about the wall and proceeded to 
teach the other boys what he had just learned. 
At first used only for teaching reading and the catechism, 
the plan was soon extended to the teaching of writing, 
simple sums, and spelling, and later to instruction in the 
higher branches. A number of monitorial high schools were 
organized in different cities of the United States, and it 
was even proposed that the plan should be adopted in the 
colleges. The system was very popular from about 1810 
to 1830, but by 1840 its popularity had waned. In many of 
the now rapidly rising cities the first free schools established
-P-A-G-E-113
  AWAKENING AN EDUCATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS 93 
were Lancastrian schools. The first free schools in Phila- 
delphia (1818) were an outgrowth of Lancastrian influence, 
as was also the case in many other Pennsylvania cities, — 
Lancaster, Columbia, Harrisburg, Pittsburg, Milton, Erie, 
New Castle, and Greencastle being among the number. 
Baltimore began a Lancastrian school six years before the 
organization of public schools was permitted there by law. 
Such schools were naturally highly organized, the organi- 
zation being largely mechanical. The Manuals of Instruc- 
  Fic. 21. Monrror inspecting Written Work at SicNAt, “SHow 
SuatEs” E 
tion gave complete directions for the organization and man- 
agement of monitorial schools, the details of recitation work, 
use of the apparatus, order, and classification being minutely 
laid down. By carefully studying and following these any 
person could soon learn to become a successful teacher in 
a monitorial school. The schools, mechanical as they now 
seem, were a great improvement over the individual method 
upon which colonial schoolmasters had wasted so much of 
their own and their pupils’ time. In place of their idleness, 
inattention, and disorder, Lancaster introduced activity, 
emulation, order, and a kind of military discipline which was 
of much value to the type of children attending these schools. 
Lancaster’s biographer, Salmon, has written of the system 
that so thoroughly was the instruction worked out that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  94 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
teacher had only to organize, oversee, reward, punish, and 
inspire: 
When a child was admitted a monitor assigned him his class; 
while he remained, a monitor taught him (with nine other pupils); 
when he was absent, one monitor ascertained the fact, and another 
found out the reason; a monitor examined him periodically, and, 
when he made progress, a monitor promoted him; a monitor ruled 
the writing paper; a monitor had charge of slates and books; and 
a monitor-general looked after all the other monitors. Every 
monitor wore a leather ticket, gilded and lettered, ‘“‘Monitor of 
the First Class,” ‘‘Reading Monitor of the Second Class,” etc. 
Value of the system in awakening interest. The Lan- 
castrian system of instruction, coming at the time it did, 
exerted a very important influence in awakening a public 
interest in and a sentiment for free schools. It did much 
toward making people see the advantages of a common school 
system, and become willing to contribute to the support 
of the same. Under the plans previously in use education 
had been a slow and an expensive process, because it had 
to be carried on by the individual method of instruction, 
and in quite small groups. Under this new plan it was now 
possible for one teacher to instruct 300, 400, 500, or more 
pupils in a single room, and to do it with much better results 
in both learning and discipline than the old type of school- 
master had achieved. It is not strange that the new plan 
aroused widespread enthusiasm in many discerning men, 
and for almost a quarter of a century was advocated as the 
best- system of education then known. Two quotations 
will illustrate what leading men of the time thought of it. 
De Witt Clinton, for twenty-one years president of the New 
York “Free School Society,” and later governor of the 
State, wrote, in 1809: 
When I perceive that many boys in our school have been taught 
to read and write in two months, who did not before know the 
alphabet, and that even one has accomplished it in three weeks — 
when I view all the bearings and tendencies of this system — when 
I contemplate the habits of order which it forms, the spirit of

emulation which it excites, the rapid improvement which it pro- 
duces, the purity of morals which it inculcates — when I behold 
the extraordinary union of celerity in instruction and economy of 
expense — and when I perceive one great assembly of a thousand 
children, under the eye of a single teacher, marching with unex- 
ampled rapidity and with perfect discipline to the goal of knowl- 
edge, I confess that I recognize in Lancaster the benefactor of the 
human race. I consider his system as creating a new era in educa- 
tion, as a blessing sent down from heaven to redeem the poor and 
distressed of this world from the power and dominion of ignorance. 
In a message to the legislature of Connecticut, a State 
then fairly well supplied with schools of the Massachusetts 
district type, Governor Wolcott said, in 1825: 
If funds can be obtained to defray the expenses of the necessary 
preparations, I have no doubt that schools on the Lancastrian 
model ought, as soon as possible, to be established in several parts 
of this state. Wherever from 200 to 1000 children can be con- 
vened within a suitable distance, this mode of instruction in every 
branch of reading, speaking, penmanship, arithmetic, and book- 
keeping, will be found much more efficient, direct, and economical 
than the practices now generally pursued in our primary schools. 
Value in preparing the way for taxation for education. 
One of the main difficulties up to this time had been the cost 
of education among people who were relatively poor, and 
unwilling to spend money for anything for which they did 
not clearly see the need. The private tutor as a means for 
education was out of the question for any except the well- 
to-do. The churches had their hands more than full in sup- 
porting schools, largely by tuition fees, for the children of 
those of their members able to contribute something toward 
their education, with a few free places for their deserving 
poor. So long as the time-honored individual method of in- 
struction, with its accompanying waste of time and disor- 
der, continued to be the prevailing method, only a small 
number of pupils could be placed under the control of a 
single teacher. The expense for this made general education 
almost prohibitive.
-P-A-G-E-118
  96 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
All at once, comparatively, a new system had been intro- 
duced which not only improved but tremendously cheap- 
ened education. In 1822 it cost but $1.22 per pupil per 
year to give instruction in New York City, though by 1844 
the per-capita cost, due largely to the decreasing size of the 
classes, had risen to $2.70, and by 1852 to $5.83. In Phila- 
delphia, in 1817, the expense was $3, as against $12 in the 
private and church schools. One finds many notices in the 
newspapers of the time as to the value and low cost of 
the new system. The following note, from The Recorder 
of Boston, for August 21, 1816, is typical: 
A school on the Lancastrian plan has been recently established 
in Chillicothe, Ohio. The progress of the children is much more 
rapid than in the common schools; their exercises highly conducive 
to health; their lessons calculated to promote the purest morality; 
their books furnished; and the expenses no more than $2.50 by the 
quarter. 
These sums are very low compared with present-day costs, 
or costs of even a decade ago. 
The Lancastrian schools materially hastened the adoption 
of the free school system in all the Northern States by grad- 
ually accustoming people to bearing the necessary taxa- 
tion which free schools entail. They also made the com- 
mon school common and much talked of, and awakened 
thought and provoked discussion on the question of public 
education. They likewise dignified the work of the teacher 
by showing the necessity for teacher training. The Lan- 
castrian Model Schools, first established in 1818, were the 
precursors of our normal schools. ; 
4. The Infani-School Societies 
Origin of the Infant-School idea. A curious condition 
in this country was that in some of the cities where public 
schools had been established, by one agency or another, no 
provision had been made for beginners. These were sup- 
posed to obtain the elements of reading at home, or in 
the dame schools. In Boston, for example, where public  
-P-A-G-E-119
AWAKENING AN EDUCATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS 97 
schools were maintained by the city, no children could be 
received into the schools who had not learned to read and 
write. This made the common age of admission somewhere 
near eight years. ‘The same was in part true of Hartford, 
New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and other cities. When 
the monitorial schools were established they tended to re- 
strict their membership in a similar manner, though not 
always able to do so. 
In 1816 there came to this country, also from England, a 
valuable supplement to education as then known in the 
form of the so-called Infant-School idea. It had originated 
at New Lanark, in Scotland, in 1799, where a manufacturer 
by the name of Robert Owen had established a school for 
the children in his town and factories. The factory children 
were poor children of the town who had been bound out 
to him at five, six, and seven years of age, for a period of 
nine years. They worked as apprentices and helpers twelve 
to thirteen hours a day in the factories, and at early man- 
hood were turned free to join the ignorant mass of the popu- 
lation. Owen sought to remedy this situation by opening a 
school which took the children at three years of age, and by 
amusements and instruction tried to give them moral, phy- 
sical, and intellectual training. The idea, in the hands of 
his teachers, worked well; but in the hands of others else- 
where it was soon formalized, and book learning was made 
a prominent feature of the Infant Schools. 
Infant Schools in the Eastern cities. In this formalized 
state the idea reached Boston, in 1816, and for the next 
two years an agitation was carried on for the establishment 
of Infant or Primary Schools. In 1818 the city appropri- 
ated $5000 for the purpose of organizing such schools to 
supplement the public school system, and appointed a sup- 
plemental school committee of three citizens in each of the 
then twelve wards to organize and direct the so-called pri- 
mary schools. These schools were to admit children at four 
years of age, were to be taught by women, were to be open 
all the year round, and were to prepare the children for
-P-A-G-E-120
en rn nn emer aes 
98 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
admission to the city schools, which by that time had come 
to be known as English grammar schools. Separate schools 
were established, separate school buildings were erected, 
and a new set of teachers was employed. The manage- 
ment of the primary schools remained separate from that 
of the grammar schools until 1854, when the two were com- 
bined under one city School Committee. Providence, simi- 
larly, established primary schools in 1828 for children be- 
tween the ages of four 
and eight, to supple- 
ment the work of the 
public schools, there 
called writing schools.

in charge, and using monitorial methods. A second school 
was established the next year. In 1830 the name was 
changed from Infant School to Primary Department, and

where possible these departments were combined with the 
existing schools. - In 1832 it was decided to organize ten 
primary schools, under women teachers, for children from 
four to ten years of age, and after the Boston plan of in- 
struction. This abandoned the monitorial plan of instruc- 
tion for the new Pestalozzian form, described in Chapter IX, 
which was deemed better suited to the needs of the smaller

children. By 1844 fifty-six Primary Departments had been 
organized in connection with the upper schools of the city. 
In Philadelphia there were three Infant-School Societies 
founded in 1827-28, and such schools were at once estab- 
lished there. By 1830 the directors of the school system had 
been permitted by the legislature of the State to expend pub- 
lic money for such schools, and thirty such, under women 
teachers, were in operation in the city by 1837. 
Primary education organized. The Infant-School idea 
was soon somewhat generally adopted by the Eastern cities, 
and changed somewhat to make of it an American primary 
school. Where children had not been previously admitted 
to the schools without ee ae to read, as in Boston, 
LIBRA

| they supplemented the work of the public schools by add- 
| ing a new school beneath. Where the reverse had been the 
case, as in New York City, the organization of Infant 
Schools as Junior Departments enabled the existing schools 
to advance their work. Everywhere it resulted, eventually, 
in the organization of primary and grammar school depart- 
ments, often with intermediate departments in between, 
and, with the somewhat contemporaneous evolution of the 
first high schools, the main outlines of the American free 
public school system were now complete. 
Unlike the monitorial schools, the infant schools were 
based on the idea of small-group work, and were usually 
conducted in harmony with the new psychological con- 
ceptions of instruction which had by that time been worked 
out by Pestalozzi in Switzerland, and introduced into the 
Infant Schools of England. The Infant-School idea came 
at an opportune time, as the defects of the mechanical Lan- 
castrian instruction were becoming evident and its popular- 
ity was waning. It gave a new and a somewhat deeper phil- 
osophical interpretation of the educational process, created 
a stronger demand than had before been known for trained 
teachers, established a preference for women teachers for 
primary work, and tended to give a new dignity to teaching 
and school work by revealing something of a psychologi- 
cal basis for the instruction of little children. It also con- 
tributed its share toward the awakening of a sentiment for 
intelligently directed public education. 
These four important educational movements — the 
secular Sunday School, the semi-public city School Socie- 
ties, the Lancastrian plan for instruction, and the Infant- 
School idea — all arising in philanthropy, came as successive 
educational ideas to America during the first half of the 
nineteenth century, supplemented one another, and together 
accustomed a new generation to the idea of a common school 
- for all.

II. Soctat, Pourricat, AND Economic INFLUENCES 
It is hardly probable, however, that these philanthropic 
efforts alone, valuable as they were, could have resulted in 
the great battle for tax-supported schools, at as early a date 
as this took place, had they not been supplemented by a 
number of other movements of a social, political, and eco- 
nomic character which in themselves materially changed the 
nature and direction of our national life. The more im- 
portant of these will be described briefly. 
1. The growth of the cities 
Growth of city population. At the time of the inaugura- 
tion of our national government nearly every one lived on 
the farm or in some little village. The first forty years of 
our national life were essentially an agricultural and a pio- 
neer period. Even as late as 1820 there were but thirteen 
cities of 8000 inhabitants or over in the whole of the twenty- 
three States at that time comprising the Union, and these 
thirteen cities contained but 4.9 per cent of. the total popu- 
lation of the Nation. Under such conditions education was 
largely a rural affair and, except in the more settled portions 
of the country, was almost certain to be generally neglected 
for the more important duties of cutting down the forests, 
draining the swamps, establishing farms and homes, and 
providing food and shelter for family and stock. Every 
child was then an asset, and was put to work at as early an 
age as possible. Few could bespared to go toschool. It was 
a time of hard work, with few comforts and pleasures, and 
with but little need for the school of books. 
After about 1825 these conditions began to change. By 
1820 many little villages were springing up, and these fre- 
quently proved the nuclei for future cities. In New Eng- 
land many of these places were in the vicinity of some water- 
fall, where cheap power made manufacturing on a large 
scale possible. Lowell, Massachusetts, which in 1820 did 
not exist and in 1840 had a population of over twenty thou-
-P-A-G-E-124
ee en me ee 
102 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
sand people, collected there largely to work in the mills, is 
a good illustration. Other cities, such as Cincinnati and 
Detroit, grew because of their advantageous situation as 
exchange and wholesale centers. With the revival of trade 
and commerce after the second war with Great Britain the 
cities grew rapidly both in number and size, as may be seen 
from the following table.

The rise of the new cities and the rapid growth of the 
older ones materially changed the nature of the educational 
problem, by producing an entirely new set of social and edu- 
cational conditions for the people of the Central and North- 
ern States to solve. The South, with its plantation life, 
negro slavery, and absence of manufacturing was largely 
unaffected by these changed conditions until well after the 
close of the Civil War. In consequence the educational 
awakening there did not come for nearly half a century after 
it came in the North. 
2. The rise of manufacturing 
The beginnings in our country. During the colonial 
period manufacturing was still in the home or village stage 
of development. Almost all articles of use and wear were
-P-A-G-E-125
Le eee OE SES eT a Me ee eee ae ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ere 
AWAKENING AN EDUCATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS 103 
made by the family inthe home. Wagons and furniture were 
made in the villages, and the traveling shoemaker came 
around from time to time to make up shoes for all the fam- 
ily. In 1787 the first American factory is said to have been 
started, at Beverly, Massachusetts. In 1791 the first cotton 
spinning-mill was set up on the falls of the Pawtucket River, 
in Rhode Island, and the beginnings of New England’s su- 
premacy in the cotton-spinning industry were made. By 
1804 there were four cotton-mills in operation, and by 1807, 
fifteen. 
Up to 1807, though, the development of our country was 
almost wholly agricultural. This had meant a scattered and 
an isolated population, with few common ideas, common 
interests, or common needs. Nearly all the manufactured 
articles not made in the homes or the villages were made in 
Great Britain. The Embargo of 1807, laid by Congress on 
American shipping, cut off articles of English manufacture 
and soon led to the rise of many “infant industries.” Many 
of the legislative acts of the next five years had to do with the 
granting of charters and privileges to various kinds of manu- 
factories. The War of 1812, the troubles with Napoleon, 
and the general westward movement of the population, all 
tended for a time to build up manufacturing faster than 
agriculture. At the end of the struggle with Napoleon 
(1815) this country, due to the lack of any adequate pro- 
tective tariff, was for a time flooded with manufactured 
articles from Europe. As a result, the “infant industries” 
were paralyzed, and an era of hard times set in which con- 
tinued to about 1820. This condition was in time corrected 
by the protective tariff, and following its enactment a great 
industrial development took place. 
The industrial transformation. The three decades from 
1820 to 1850 were characterized by a rapid development of 
manufacturing and a rapid growth of cities, in which most 
of the new manufacturing plants were established. The 
introduction of the steamboat (1809) and the steam rail- 
road (1826), together with the digging of many canals (the 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
104 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
famous Erie Canal was opened in 1825), opened up the pos- 
sibility of doing business on a scale before unthought of, and 
led to a great demand for manufactured articles and labor- 
saving machinery of every sort. The first steam railroad, 
three miles long, was built in 1826, and by 1850, 9021 miles 
had been constructed in the United States. One could now 
travel by rail from Maine to North Carolina, to Buffalo on 
Lake Erie, and from the western end of Lake Erie to Cin- 
cinnati or Chicago. By 1860 steam railways had been built 
westward into Iowa, Missouri, and Arkansas, and thirty 
thousand miles of rails were carrying agricultural products 
from the interior and manufactured products from the sea- 
board cities back to the interior. The invention of the tele- 
graph (first line, 1844) also tremendously increased the 
possibilities of doing business on a large scale. 
The inventive genius of our people was now called into 
play, and Yankee ingenuity manifested itself in every direc- 
tion. After 1825 the threshing machine began to supplant 
the flail and the roller; after 1826 edge tools began to be 
made in this country; and shortly after this time the Fair- 
banks platform scale, the mower, the reaper, and the lock- 
stitch sewing machine were invented. Kerosene lamps were 
devised, improved cook-stoves were put on the market, and 
the friction match superseded the flint. The coal measures 
west of the Alleghenies were opened, and anthracite in the 
East was put touse. The great work of steam had begun, 
the chimneys of factories were rising over the land, and the 
steam engine was applied to both boat and train, to running 
the power loom and the printing-press, and to the steam 
hammer for working iron and steel. Between 1820 and 1850 
industrial methods in America were revolutionized. 
How manufacturing changed the position of the city. In 
the cities in the coast States north of Maryland, but particu- 
larly in those of New York and New England, manufactur- 
ing developed very rapidly. Cotton-spinning in particular 
became a New England industry, as did also the weaving of 
wool, while Pennsylvania became the center of the iron

manufacturing industries. The cotton-spinning industry 
illustrates the rapid growth of manufacturing in the United 
States. The 15 cotton-mills of 1807 had increased to 801 
by 1831, and to 1240 by 1840. The distribution of indus- 
trial plants in the United States by 1833, pictured in the 
map on the preceeding page, shows the development in the 
Northern and Eastern cities. The South owed its pros- 
perity chiefly to cotton-growing and shipping, and did not 
develop factories and workshops until a much more recent 
period. 
Now the development of this new type of factory work 
meant the beginnings of the breakdown of the old home and 
village industries, the start of the cityward movement of 
the rural population, and the concentration of manufacturing 
in large establishments, employing many hands to perform 
continuously certain limited phases of the manufacturing 
process. ‘This in. time was certain to mean a change in 
educational methods. It also called for the concentration 
of both capital and labor. The rise of the factory system, 
business on a large scale, and cheap and rapid transporta- 
tion, all combined to diminish the importance of agricul- 
ture and to change the city from an unimportant to a very 
important position in our national life. The 13 cities of 
1820 increased to 44 by 1840, and to 141 by 1860. There 
were four times as many cities in the North, too, where 
manufacturing had found a home, as in the South, which 
remained essentially agricultural. 
New social problems in the cities. The many changes in 
the nature of industry and of village and home life, effected 
by the development of the factory system and the concen- 
tration of manufacturing and population in the cities, also 
contributed materially in changing the character of the old 
educational problem. When the cities were as yet but 
little villages in size and character, homogeneous in their 
populations, and the many social and moral problems in- 
cident to the congestion of peoples of mixed character had 
not as yet arisen, the church and charity and private school

solution of the educational problem was reasonably satis- 
factory. As the cities now rapidly increased in size, became 
more city-like in character, drew to them diverse elements 
previously largely unknown, and were required by state 
laws to extend the right of suffrage to all their citizens, the 
need for a new type of educational organization began 
slowly but clearly to manifest itself to an increasing number 
of citizens. The church, charity, and private school system 
completely broke down under the new strain. School Socie- 
ties and Educational Associations, organized for propaganda, 
now arose in the cities; grants of city or state funds for the 
partial support of both church and society schools were 
demanded and obtained; and numbers of charity organiza- 
tions began to be established in the different cities to enable 
them to handle better the new problems of pauperism, in- 
temperance, and juvenile delinquency which arose. 
In 1833 it was estimated that one eighth of the total 
population of New York City was composed of public pau- 
pers or criminals, while the city had one saloon for every 
eighty men, women, and children in the total population. 
Other cities presented somewhat similar conditions. Child 
labor and woman labor, for long hours and for very low 
wages, became very common. The powerful restraining in- 
fluences of the old home, with its strict moral code and reli- 
gious atmosphere, seriously weakened. Idle and uneducated 
children, with little or no home control, appeared in numbers 
on the streets, and the prevalence of juvenile crime and 
juvenile arrests began to turn attention to education as a 
possible remedy. The disintegrating effects of the new city 
life on the family, and its demoralizing effect upon the chil- 
dren, made a deep impression upon those possessed of hu- 
manitarian impulses, as it did also on many of the parents 
of the children concerned. We soon find these two very 
dissimilar groups of people — the humanitarians on the one 
hand and the new city laboring classes on the other — unit- 
ing in a propaganda for tax-supported schools.

108 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
3. The extension of the suffrage 
Breaking the rule of a class. As was stated in the pre- 
ceding chapter, the Constitution of the United States, 
though framed by the ablest men of the time, was framed 
by men who represented the old aristocratic conception of 
education and government. The same was true of the con- 
ventions which framed practically all the early state con- 
stitutions. The early leaders in our government — Wash- 
ington, Madison, Hancock, Adams, Hamilton, Jay — had 
been of this older aristocratic class. The Federalist Party, 
a party which rendered very conspicuous service in welding 
the States into a strong and enduring Union, had never- 
theless represented this older privileged group, and by 1817 
had done its work and been broken up. The early period 
of our national life was thus characterized by the rule of a 
class — a very well educated and a very capable class, to be 
sure — but a class elected by a ballot based on property 
qualifications and belonging to the older type of political 
and social thinking. 
Notwithstanding the statements of the Declaration of 
Independence, the change came but slowly. Up to 1815 
but four States had granted the right to vote to all male 
citizens, regardless of property holdings or other somewhat 
similar restrictions. After 1815 a democratic movement, 
which sought to abolish all class rule and all political in- 
equalities, arose and rapidly gained strength. In this the 
new States to the westward, with their absence of old estates 
or large fortunes, and where men were judged more on their 
merits than in an older society, were the leaders. As will 
be seen from the map, every new State admitted east of the 
Mississippi River, except Ohio (admitted in 1802), where the 
New England element predominated, and Louisiana (1812), 
provided for full manhood suffrage at the time of their admis- 
sion to statehood. Five additional Eastern States had 
extended the same full voting privileges to their citizens by 
1845, while the old requirements had been materially modi-

fied in most of the other Northern States. Writing on the 
influence of the West, Professor Turner says: 
The frontier States that came into the Union in the first quarter 
of a century of its existence came in with democratic suffrage 
provisions, and had reactive effects of the highest importance upon 
States shaded granted full suffrage 
at the time of admission to the Union-«*

the older States whose people were being attracted there. An 
extension of the suffrage became essential. It was western New 
York that forced an extension of the suffrage in the constitutional 
convention of that State in 1821; and it was western Virginia that 
compelled the tide-water region to put in a more liberal provision 
in the constitution of 1830, and to give the frontier region a 
more nearly proportional representation with the tide-water aris- 
tocracy. 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
    110 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Significance of the election of Jackson. The struggle for 
the overthrow of the old class government came to a head 
in 1828, when Andrew Jackson was elected President. From 
Washington down to John Quincy Adams the Presidents 
had been drawn from the old aristocratic class, and the edu- 
cated and propertied classes of Massachusetts, New York, 
and Virginia had largely furnished the leaders for the Na- 
tion. Jackson, on the other hand, represented the frontier, 
and was everywhere regarded as “a man of the people.” His 
election was a reaction against trained leadership in govern- 
mental affairs. The period when the people were to follow 
men of education and good breeding was now for a time 
largely past. The people had become impatient of the old 
claims as to the superiority of any class, and the demand for 
equal suffrage and for full participation in the functions of 
government now became too insistent to be disregarded 
longer. 
This impatience and distrust expressed itself also with ref- 
erence to governors and legislatures, and a popular demand 
for changes here now arose. In place of the former plan of 
electing a governor and allowing him to appoint most of the 
other officials, a long list of elected officials now appeared. 
The people demanded and usually obtained the right to 
vote for every possible officer, and short terms in office be- 
came the rule. Legislatures, too, instead of being allowed 
to meet when and for as long as they pleased, were now 
closely limited as to length of session, and allowed to meet 
only at stated times. This democratic movement for the 
leveling cf all distinctions between white men became very 
marked after 1820, and the final result was full manhood 
suffrage in all the States. This gave the farmer in the West 
and the new working classes in the cities a preponderating 
influence in the affairs of government. Jackson represented 
both these elements, and was elected by an electoral vote of 
178 to 83 over John Quincy Adams, in 1828, and by a vote 
of 219 to 49 over Henry Clay, in 1832. 
Educational significance of the extension of the suffrage.
-P-A-G-E-133
  
  AWAKENING AN EDUCATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS 111 
The educational significance of the extension of full man- 
hood suffrage to all was enormous and far reaching. Up to 
the time of the separation of Church and State, education 
had not been conceived of as a function with which the 
State_was specially.concerned. Since the right to vote was 
closely limited by religious or property qualifications, or 
both, there was no particular reason why the State should 
assume the rdle of schoolmaster. Such citizens as were 
qualified by faith or property holdings to vote or hold office 
were amply able to pay for the education of their children 
privately. It /was not necessary, either, for more than a 
small percentage of the people to be educated. The small 
educated class conducted the affairs of Church and State; 
the great majority formed “the hewers of wood and the 
drawers of water”’ for society. 
With the extension of the suffrage to all classes of the pop- 
ulation, poor as well as rich, laborer as well as employer, there 
came to thinking men, often for the first time, a realization 
that general education had become a fundamental necessity 
for the State, and that the general education of all in the 
elements of knowledge and civic virtue must now assume 
that importance in the minds of the leaders of the State that 
the education of a few for the service of the Church and of 
the many for simple church membership had once held in the 
minds of ecclesiastics. 
This new conception is well expressed in the preamble to 
the first (optional) school law enacted in Illinois (1825), 
which declares: 
To enjoy our rights and liberties, we must understand them; 
their security and protection ought to be the first object of a free 
people; and it is a well-established fact that no nation has ever 
continued long in the enjoyment of civil and political freedom, 
which was not both virtuous and enlightened; and believing that 
the advancement of literature always has been, and ever will be 
the means of developing more fully the rights of man, that the 
mind of every citizen in a republic is the common property of 
society, and constitutes the basis of its strength and happiness; it  
-P-A-G-E-134
112 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
is therefore considered the peculiar duty of a free government, like 
ours, to encourage and extend the improvement and cultivation of 
the intellectual energies of the whole. 
4. New public demands for schools 
Utterances of public men. Governors now began to rec- 
ommend to their legislatures the establishment of tax-sup- 
ported schools, and public men began to urge state action 
and state control. De Witt Clinton, for nine years governor 
of New York, in a message to the legislature, in 1826, defend- 
ing the schools established, said: 
The first duty of government, and the surest evidence of good 
government, is the encouragement of education. A general diffu- 
sion of knowledge is a precursor and protector of republican 
institutions, and in it we must confide as the conservative power 
that will watch over our liberties and guard them against fraud, 
intrigue, corruption, and violence. I consider the system of our 
common schools as the palladium of our freedom, for no reasonable 
apprehension can be entertained of its subversion as long as the 
great body of the people are enlightened by education. 
Again in his message of 1827, he added: 
The great bulwark of republican government is the cultivation 
of education; for the right of suffrage cannot be exercised in a salu- 
tary manner without intelligence. 
In an address delivered before the Pennsylvania legisla- 
ture, in 1835, defending the Free School Law of 1834, which 
it was then proposed to repeal, Thaddeus Stevens declared: 
If an elective Republic is to endure for any length of time, every 
elector must have sufficient information not only to accumulate 
wealth and take care of his pecuniary concerns, but to direct 
wisely the legislature, the ambassadors, and the Executive of the 
Nation — for some part of all these things, some agency in ap- 
proving or disapproving of them, falls to every freeman. If, then, 
the permanency of our Government depends upon such knowledge, 
it is the duty of Government to see that the means of informa- 
tion be diffused to every citizen. This is a sufficient answer to 
those who deem education a private and not a public duty.

Daniel Webster, in an address delivered at Madison, In- 
diana, in 1837, said: 
Education, to accomplish the ends of good government, should 
be universally diffused. Open the doors of the schoolhouses to all 
the children in the land. Let no man have the excuse of poverty 
for not educating his offspring. Place the means of education 
within his reach, and if he remain in ignorance, be it his own 
reproach. ...On the diffusion of education among the people 
rests the preservation and perpetuation of our free institutions. 
In the Sangamon (Illinois) Journal, of March 15, 1832, 
there appeared an interesting communication from a future 
president of the United States, a part of which read: 
To the People of Sangamo(n) County: 
Fellow Citizens: Having become a candidate for the honorable 
office of one of your Representatives in the next General Assembly 
of this State, in accordance with an established custom and the 
principles of true republicanism, it becomes my duty to make 
known to you, the people whom I propose to represent — my senti- 
ments with regard to local affairs. . . . 
Upon the subject of education, not presuming to dictate any 
plan or system respecting it, I can only say that I view it as the 
most important subject which we as a people can be engaged in. 
That every man may receive at least a moderate education, and 
thereby be enabled to read the histories of his own and other coun- 
tries, by which he may duly appreciate the value of our free insti- 
tutions, appears to be an object of vital importance, even on this 
account alone, to say nothing of the advantages and satisfaction 
to be derived from all being able to read the Scriptures and other 
works, both of a religious and moral nature, for themselves. For 
my part, I desire to see the time when education, and by its means, 
morality, sobriety, enterprise, and industry, shall become much 
more general than at present, and should be gratified to have it 
in my power to contribute something to the advancement of any 
measure which might have a tendency to accelerate the happy 
period.

  114 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
demands for schools and education, urging the free educa- 
tion of their children as a natural right. In 1829 the work- 
ingmen of Philadelphia asked each candidate for the legis- 
lature for a formal declaration of the attitude he would 
assume toward the provision of “an equal and a general sys- 
tem of education” for the State. In 1830 the Workingmen’s 
Committee of Philadelphia submitted a detailed report, after 
five months spent in investigating educational conditions 
in Pennsylvania, vigorously condemning the lack of pro- 
vision for education in the State, and the utterly inadequate 
provision where any was made. Seth Luther, in an address 
on “The Education of Workingmen,” delivered in 1832, 
declared that “a large body of human beings are ruined by 
a neglect of education, rendered miserable in the extreme, 
and incapable of self-government.” Stephen Simpson, in 
his A Manual for Workingmen, published in 1831, declared 
that “‘it is to education, therefore, that we must mainly look 
for redress of that perverted system of society, which dooms 
the producer to ignorance, to toil, and to penury, to moral 
degradation, physical want, and social barbarism.” 
With the invention of the steam printing-press the first 
modern newspapers at a cheap price appeared. These 
usually espoused progressive measures, and tremendously 
influenced public sentiment. Those not closely connected 
with church or private-school interests usually favored pub- 
lic tax-supported schools. The Delaware Free Press, for 
example, in 1835, declared a part of its mission to be: 
To awaken the attention of Working People to the importance 
of codperation in order to attain the rank and station in society 
to which they are justly entitled by virtue of their industry, but 
from which they are erdndal by want of a system of Equal Republican 
Education. 
In 1837 the Providence (Rhode Island) Association of 
Mechanics and Manufacturers petitioned the city council 
for an improvement of the schools of the city, in particular 
asking for more schools, smaller classes, and better salaries
-P-A-G-E-139

forthe teachers, and affirming that “no subject can be of 
more importance to the inhabitants of this city than the 
education of the rising generation.” 
At first various substitutes for state support and control 
were tried. School Societies, as we have seen, were chartered. 
Religious and benevolent schools were subsidized. Nu- 
merous lotteries for the support of schools were authorized 
by law. Grants of public land for their endowment were 
made. State support only of pauper schools was tried. 
Freedom of taxation to schools and educational societies 
was granted. Finally, all these makeshifts failing to meet 
the needs of the time, they were gradually discarded as 
unsatisfactory and insufficient, and, the battle for free, tax- 
supported, non-sectarian, and publicly controlled and di- 
rected schools, to serve the needs of society and the State, 
was begun. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION - . Explain why the development of a national consciousness was prac- 
tically necessary before an educational consciousness could be 
awakened. 
2. Show how the many philanthropic societies for the education of the 
children of the poor came in as a natural transition from Church to 
State education. 
8. Show the importance of the School Societies in accustoming people 
to the idea of free and general education. 
4, Show how the Lancastrian system formed the necessary bridge be- 
tween private philanthropy in education and tax-supported State 
schools. 
5. Why were the highly mechanical features of the Lancastrian organi- 
zation so advantageous in its day, whereas we of to-day would regard 
them as such a disadvantage? 
6. Account for the Lancastrian system’s great superiority over the 
methods of colonial schoolmasters. 
7. Explain how the Lancastrian schools dignified the work of the 
teacher by revealing the need for teacher training. 
8. What were two of the important contributions of the Infant-School 
idea to American education? 
9. Why are schools and education much more needed in a country ex- 
periencing a city and manufacturing development than in a country 
experiencing an agricultural development?
-P-A-G-E-140

10. Show how the development of cities caused the old forms of education 
to break down, and made evident the need for a new type of education. 
11. Show how each extension of the suffrage necessitates an extension 
of educational opportunities and advantages. 
12. Show how the utterances of public men on education, quoted in this 
chapter, evidence a much clearer conception of the need for public 
education than do those quoted in the preceding chapter, with the 
possible exception of the quotation from John Adams.

THE BATTLE FOR FREE STATE SCHOOLS 
I. Arignment or INTERESTS, AND PROPAGANDA 
Stages in the development of a public school sentiment. 
Speaking broadly and of the Nation as a whole, and always 
excepting certain regions in New England, where the free- 
school idea had become thoroughly established, a study of 
the history of educational development in the older States 
to the North and East reveals, as we have so far partially 
pointed out, approximately the following stages in the de- 
velopment of a public school sentiment and the establish- 
ment of a state school system: 
+b 
2. An attempt to solve the problem through private benevolence 
or church charity, often aided by small grants of public funds. 
Aid granted to private or semi-private schools or school socie- 
ties, in the form of small money grants, license taxes, permis- 
sion to organize lotteries, or land endowments, to enable such 
schools or societies to extend their instruction or to reduce 
their tuition rates, or both. 
. Permission granted generally, or to special districts request- 
ing it, to form a tax district and organize schools — at first 
often only for paupér children, but later for othérs. 
. Laws requiring the education of the indigent poor. 
. Laws requiring a certain local effort for the maintenance of 
schools, in return for state aid received, with permission to 
supplement these sums with tuition fees. 
. Elimination of the tuition fees, thus establishing free schools. 
. Elimination of the pauper-school idea and of aid to sectarian 
schools, thus establishing the American common school. 
Something like half a century of agitation and conflict, 
again speaking broadly and of the Nation as a whole, was 
required to produce the succession of changes indicated 
above, but by 1850 it may be said that the question of
-P-A-G-E-143
BATTLE FOR FREE STATE SCHOOLS 119 
providing a common-school education for all children at 
public expense had been settled, in principle at least, in 
every Northern State. In some of the Southern States, as 
well, quite a respectable beginning looking toward the 
creation of state school systems had been made before the 
coming of the Civil War for a time put an end to all educa- 
tional development there. 
The alignment of interests. The second quarter of the 
nineteenth century may be said to have witnessed the battle 
for tax-supported, publicly controlled and directed, and 
non-sectarian common schools. In 1825 such schools were 
the distant hope of statesmen and reformers; in 1850 they 
were becoming an actuality in almost every Northern State. 
The twenty-five years intervening marked a period of pub- 
lic agitation and educational propaganda; of many hard 
legislative fights; of a struggle to secure desired legislation, 
and then to hold what had been secured; of many bitter con- 
tests with church and private-school interests, which felt 
that their “vested rights” were being taken from them; and 
of occasional referenda in which the people were asked, at 
the next election, to advise the legislature as to what to do. 
Excepting the battle for the abolition of slavery, perhaps 
no question has ever been before the American people for 
settlement which caused so much feeling or aroused such 
bitter antagonisms. Old friends and business associates 
parted company over the question, lodges were forced to 
taboo the subject to avoid disruption, ministers and their 
congregations often quarreled over the question of free 
schools, and politicians avoided the issue. The friends of 
free_schools were at first commonly regarded as-fanatics, 
dangerous to the State, and the opponents of free schools 
were considered by them as old-time conservatives or as 
selfish members of society. 
Naturally such a bitter discussion of a public question 
forced an alignment of the people for or against publicly sup- 
ported and controlled schools, and this alignment of interests 
may be roughly stated to have been about as follows:

It was, of course, not possible to so classify all persons, as 
a man might belong to two or more of the above classes. 
An example of such would be a Lutheran and a non-taxpay- 
ing workingman in a city, or a Calvinist and a heavy tax- 
payer. In all such cases there would be a conflict of inter- 
ests with the stronger one prevailing, but, in a general way, 
the above classification of the alignment of interests is ap- 
proximately correct. 
Arguments for and against free schools. Both sides to 
the controversy advanced many arguments for and against 
state tax-supported schools, the more important on each . 
side being the following: 
&D Arguments for public tax-supported schools. 
1. That education tends to prevent pauperism and crime. 
2. That. education tends to reduce poverty and distress. 
8. That education increases production, and eliminates 
wrong ideas as to the distribution of wealth.

The work of propaganda. To meet the arguments of the 
objectors, to change the opinions of a thinking few into the 
common opinion of the many, to overcome prejudice, and 
to awaken the public conscience to the public need for free 
and common schools in such a democratic society as ours, 
was the work of a generation. With many of the older citi- 
zens no progress could be made; the effective work every- 
where had to be done with the younger men of the time. 
It was the work of many years to convince the masses of the 
people that the scheme of state schools was not only prac- 
ticable, but also the best and most economical means for 
4
-P-A-G-E-147

giving their children the benefits of an education; to con- 
vince propertied citizens that taxation for education was in 
the interests of both public and private welfare; to convince 
legislators that it was safe to vote for free-school bills; and 
to overcome the opposition due to apathy, religious jeal- 
ousies, and private interests. In time, though, the desir- 
ability of common, free, tax-supported, non-sectarian, state- 
controlled schools became evident to a majority of the 
citizens in the different American States, and as it did the 
American State School, free and equally open to all, was 
finally evolved and took its place as the most important 
institution in our national life working for the perpetuation 
of our free democracy and the advancement of the public 
welfare. 
For this work of propaganda hundreds of School Societies 
and Educational Associations were organized; many con- 
ventions were held, and resolutions favoring state schools 
were adopted; many “Letters” and “Addresses to the 
Public” were written and published; public-spirited citizens 
traveled over the country, making addresses to the people 
explaining the advantages of free state schools; many public- 
spirited men gave the best years of their lives to the state- 
school propaganda; and many governors sent communica- 
tions on the subject to legislatures not yet convinced as to 
the desirability of state action. At each meeting of the legis- 
latures for years a deluge of resolutions, memorials, and 
petitions for and against free schools met the members. 
Propaganda societies. One of the earliest of these propa- 
ganda societies for state schools was the ‘‘ Pennsylvania 
Society for the Promotion of Public Economy,” organized 
in 1817. Ten years later a branch of this Society became 
the “Pennsylvania Society for the Promotion of Public 
Schools.” This Society for many years kept up a vigorous 
campaign for a state free-school law. Another early society 
of importance was the “Hartford Society for the Improve- 
ment of Common Schools,” founded in 1827. Another was 
the “ Western Academic Institute and Board of Education,” 
A 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  124 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
formed in 1829, at Cincinnati, largely by New England 
people, for propaganda work in the State of Ohio. Another 
was the Boston “Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowl- 
edge,” organized in 1829, with the promotion of public 
education as one of its objects. In 1830 the “American In- 
stitute of Instruction” was organized at Boston, and in 
1838 this Association offered a prize of $500 for the best 
essay on ‘A System of Education best adapted to the 
Common Schools of our Country.” A number of societies 
for propaganda were organized in New York State between 
1830 and 1840. In New Jersey the “Society of Teachers and 
Friends of Education” held conventions, drew up memorials 
and petitions, and its members visited all parts of the State 
advocating general education at public expense, and espe- 
cially the elimination of pauper-school education. Much 
valuable work was done by associations of teachers in Penn- 
sylvania, between 1838 and 1852. In 1839 a national con- 
vention was held in Philadelphia to discuss the needs of 
education in the United States. In 1850 an important edu- 
cation convention was ee in Harrisburg, the proceedings of 
which were printed and widely circulated. In 1838 a con- 
vention of the “Friends of Education” was held at Trenton, 
and a committee was appointed to prepare an “Address” 
to the people of the State. The result was a new school. law _ 
which instituted a partial state school system, and secured 
an increase in the state appropriation for schools from — 
$20,000 to $30,000 yearly. 
The decades of the thirties and the forties witnessed the — 
formation of a large number of these educational associa- _ 
tions, organized to build up a sentiment for public educa- 
tion. They were founded not only in the older States of the 
East, but also in such widely scattered States as Georgia, 
Florida, and Tennessee. In 1829 the “ Western Academic In- 
stitute and Board of Education” was formed at Cincinnati, — 
such men as Samuel Lewis, Lyman Beecher, and Professor 
Calvin E. Stowe being prominent in its organization. For | 
more than a decade this association and its successor, the ©
-P-A-G-E-149
BATTLE FOR FREE STATE SCHOOLS 125 
“Western Literary Institute and College of Professional 
Teachers” (1832) made Cincinnati the center of educational 
propaganda in the then West. It raised money, employed 
an agent to visit the schools of the State, diffused informa- 
tion as to education, tried to elevate the character of the 
teachers of the State, and repeatedly sent delegations to the 
legislature to ask for action. It sent Professor Stowe to 
Europe to investigate education there, and on his return in- 
duced the legislature (1837) to print 10,000 copies of his 
Report on Elementary Education in Europe for distribution. 
This Report was also reprinted afterward by the legislatures 
of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Massachusetts, North Carolina, 
and Virginia. In 1836 it called a state convention of the 
“Friends of Education,” in 1837 induced the legislature to 
create the office of Superintendent of Common Schools, and 
in 1838 the culmination of its efforts came in what has been 
frequently called “the great school law of Ohio.” 
In 1834 over half the counties of Illinois sent delegates to 
an “Illinois Educational Convention” at Vandalia, which 
appointed a committee of seven to draft a memorial to the 
legislature and outline a plan for common schools and an. 
“Address” to the people of the State. In 1844 a conven- 
tion of “Friends of Education,” held at Peoria, demanded 
of the legislature the appointment of a State Superintendent 
of Schools and the levying of a state school tax. In 1845 
the'Democratic Convention of Wilkinson County, Kentucky, 
adopted elaborate resolutions in favor of the establishment 
of free public schools, and instructed its delegates to the 
state convention to press the matter. In 1847 a number of 
“State Common School Conventions” were held in Indiana 
to build up sentiment for taxation for schools. These are 
but examples of the work of the numerous propaganda so- 
cicties, formed in increasing numbers between 1825 and 
1850. 
Support from associations of workingmen. Workingmen, 
too, through their newly formed organizations, also took 
a prominent part in the propaganda for the establishment
-P-A-G-E-150

126. EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
of public tax-supported schools. Among the many resolu- 
tions adopted by these wage-earners the following are 
typical: 
At a General Meeting of Mechanics and Workingmen 
held in New York City, in 1829, it was: 
Resolved, that next to life and liberty, we consider education the 
greatest blessing bestowed upon mankind. 
Resolved, that the public funds should be appropriated (to a 
reasonable extent) to the purpose of education upon a regular 
system that shall insure the opportunity to every individual of 
obtaining a competent education before he shall have arrived at 
the age of maturity. 
At a meeting of workingmen held in Philadelphia, in 
1829, it was declared that: 
No system of education, which a freeman can accept, has yet 
been established for the poor; whilst thousands of dollars of the 
public money has been appropriated for building colleges and 
academies for the rich. 
Each candidate for the state legislature was formally asked 
to declare his attitude toward “an equal and general system 
of Education.” In 1830 they adopted a long Report on the 
conditions of education in Pennsylvania, demanded schools, 
and declared that there could be “‘no real liberty in a repub- 
lic without a wide diffusion of real intelligence.” 
In 1830 the Workingmen’s Party of Philadelphia included, 
as the first plank in its platform: 
Resolved, that the time has arrived when it becomes the para- 
mount duty of every friend to the happiness and freedom of man 
to promote a system of education that shall embrace equally all 
the children of the state, of every rank and condition. 
In 1830 an Association of Workingmen was formed at 
New Castle, Delaware, and in their constitution they pro- 
vided: i 
Let us unite at the polls and give our votes to no candidate who 
is not pledged to support a rational system of education to be paid 
for out of the public funds.
-P-A-G-E-151
BATTLE FOR FREE STATE SCHOOLS 127 
At a Boston meeting of “Workingmen, Mechanics, and 
others friendly to their interests,” in 1830, it was: 
Resolved, that the establishment of a liberal system of education, 
attainable by all, should be among the first efforts of every law- 
giver who desires the continuance of our national independence. 
In 1830 the “ Farmers’, Mechanics’, and Workingmen’s” 
Party of New York State, in convention at Salina, included 
as one of the planks in its platform the following: 
Resolved, that a scheme of education, more universal in its effects, 
is practicable, so that no child in the republick, however poor, 
should grow up without an opportunity to acquire at least a com- 
petent English education; and that the system should be adapted 
to the conditions of the poor both in the city and country. 
In 1835 the workingmen of the city of Washington enu- 
merated as one of their demands the establishment of “ 
universal system < of education,” and in 1836 the “General 
Trades Union” of Cincinnati, in an “Appeal to the Working- 
men of the West,” urged that they try to elevate their con- 
dition by directing their efforts toward obtaining “a na- 
tional system of education.” 
Recommendations of governors. A number of the early 
governors were public men of large vision, who saw the de- 
sirability of the State establishing a general system of edu- 
cation years before either the legislature or the people had 
clearly sensed the need. In Delaware, for example, almost 
every year from 1822 to 1829 succeeding governors urged 
the legislature to establish a genuine system of education, 
as provided for in the state constitution (p. 62). The peo- 
ple, however, were unwilling to tax themselves for schools, 
and only the city of Wilmington made any real headway in 
providing them. In Pennsylvania, in 1825, the governor 
made a strong plea for a system of education, and again in 
1828 the legislature was urged to establish a public school 
system, but the first free school law dates from 1834. The 
messages of the New York governors, especially the two 
Clintons, form famous documents in favor of free tax-sup- 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
128 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
ported schools. In 1826, 1827, 1828, 1829, 1835, and 1836 
New York governors urged the State’s duty, and held that 
the establishment of a good system of public instruction was 
an evidence of good government. In Connecticut (1825, 
1828), Massachusetts (1826, 1837), and Maine (1831) gov- 
ernors recommended an improvement in the schools, and a 
dependence upon a wide diffusion of education for the hap- 
piness and security of the State. 
After 1825, and especially through the decade of the 
thirties, governors generally began to give emphasis to edu- 
cation in their messages. In the new Western States the 
messages often were clear and emphatic, and the arguments 
for education strong. While usually at the time not in- 
fluencing a legislature to action, these messages were influ- 
ential in effecting a change in the attitude of the people 
toward the question of tax-supported schools.

The problem which confronted those interested in estab- 
A lishing state-controlled schools was not exactly the same in 
¢ any two States, though the battle in many States possessed 
common elements, and hence was somewhat similar in char- 
acter. Instead of tracing the struggle in detail in each of 
the different States, it will be much more profitable for our 
purposes to pick out the main strategic points in the contest, 
and then illustrate the conflict for these by describing con- 
ditions in one or two States where the controversy was most 
severe or most typical. The seven strategic points in the 
struggle for free, tax-supported, non-sectarian, state-con- 
trolled schools were: iis 
. The battle for tax support. 
. The battle to eliminate the pauper-school idea. 
. The battle to make the schools entirely free. 
. The battle to establish state supervision. 
The battle to eliminate sectarianism. orm 09 we

6. The battle to extend the system upward. 
7. Addition of the state university to crown the system. 
In this and the two following chapters we shall consider 
each of these, in order. 
1. The battle for tax support 
Early support and endowment funds. In New England, 
land endowments, local taxes, direct local appropriations, 
license taxes, and rate bills (that is, a per-capita tax levied 
on the parents of the children attending school) had long 
been common. Land endowments began early in the New 
England colonies, while rate bills date back to the earliest 
times and long remained a favorite means of raising money 
for school support. These means were adopted in the dif- 
ferent States after the beginning of our national period, and 
to them were added a variety of license taxes, while occu- 
pational taxes, lotteries, and bank taxes also were employed 
to raise money for schools. A few examples of these may 
be cited: 
Connecticut, in 1774, turned over all proceeds of liquor 
. licenses to the towns where collected, to be used for schools. 
New Orleans, in 1826, licensed two theaters on condition 
that they each pay $3000 annually for the support of 
schools in the city. New York, in 1799, authorized four 
state lotteries to raise $100,000 for schools, a similar amount 
again in 1801, and numerous other lotteries before 1810. 
Congress passed fourteen joint resolutions, between 1812 
and 1836, authorizing lotteries to help support the schools 
of the city of Washington. Bank taxes were a favorite 
source of income for schools, between about 1825 and 1860, 
banks being chartered on condition that they would pay over 
each year for schools a certain sum or percentage of their 
earnings. These all represent what is known as indirect. 
taxation, and were valuable in accustoming the people to the 
idea of public schools without appearing to tax them for 
their support. 
The National Land Grants, begun in the case of Ohio in,
-P-A-G-E-154
130 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
1802 (p. 59), soon stimulated a new interest in schools. 
Each State admitted after Ohio also received the sixteenth 
section for the support of common schools, and 
ships of of land for the endowment of a state university. The 
new Western States, following the lead of Ohio (p. 60), 
dedicated these section lands and funds to free common 
schools. The sixteen older States, however, did not share in 
these grants, so most of them now set about building up a 
permanent school fund of their own, though at first without 
any very clear idea as to how the income from the fund was 
to be used. Connecticut and New York both had set aside 
lands, before 1800, to create such a fund, Connecticut’s fund 
dating back to 1750. Delaware, in 1796, devoted the income 
from marriage and tavern licenses to the same purpose, but — 
made no use of the fund for twenty years. Connecticut, in 
1795, sold its “ Western Reserve”’ in Ohio for $1,200,000, and 
added this to its school fund. New York, in 1805, similarly 
added the proceeds of the sale of half a million acres of state 
lands, though the fund then formally created accumulated 
unused until 1812. Tennessee began to build up a perma- 
nent state school fund in 1806; Virginia in 1810; South Caro- 
lina in 1811; Maryland in 1812; New Jersey in 1816; Georgia 
in 1817; “Maine, New Hampshire, Kentucky, and “Louisiana 
in 1821; Vermont and North Carolina in 1825; Pennsylvania 
in 1831; and Massachusetts in 1834. These were estab- 
lished as permanent state funds, the annual income only 
to be used, in some way to be determined later, for the sup- 
port of some form of schools. Some of these funds, as 
has just been stated, accumulated for years before any use 
was made of the income (New York for twelve; Delaware 
for twenty; New Jersey for thirteen), while the income 
in other of the States was for a time used exclusively for 
the support of pauper schools. New Jersey, Pennsylvania, 
Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia all for a time 
belonged to this latter re These permanent funds 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  
BATTLE FOR FREE STATE SCHOOLS 131 
_ later went for school support and to that extent relieved 
taxation. 
The beginnings of school taxation. The early idea, which 
seems for a time to have been generally entertained, that 
the income from land grants, license fees, and these perma- 
nent endowment funds would in time entirely support the 
necessary schools, was gradually abandoned as it was seen 
how little in yearly income these funds and lands really 
produced, and how rapidly the population of the States was 
increasing. By 1825 it may be said to have been clearly 
recognized by thinking men that the only safe reliance of 
a system of state schools lay in the general and direct tax- 
ation of all property for their support. “The wealth of 
the State must.educate the children of the State” became a 
watchword, and the battle for direct, local, county, and 
state taxation for education was clearly on by 1825 to 1830 
in all the Northern States, except the four in New England 
where the principle of taxation for education had for long 
been established. Now for the first time direct taxation for 
schools was likely to be felt by the taxpayer, and the fight 
for and against the imposition of such taxation was on in 
earnest. The course of the struggle and the results were 
somewhat different in the different States, but, in a general 
way, the progress of the conflict was somewhat as follows: 
“Permission granted to communities so desiring to organize a 
school taxing district, and to tax for school support the prop- 
erty of those consenting and residing therein. 
2. Taxation of all property in the taxing district permitted. 
8. State aid to such districts, at first from the income from per- 
/ manent endowment funds, and later from the proceeds of a 
small state appropriation or a state or county tax. 
Mo _ Compulsory local taxation to supplement the state or county 
grant. 
Types of early permissive legislation. In the older States, 
always excepting the four Calvinistic New England States, _ 
the beginnings of this permissive legislation were usually. 
obtained by the cities. With their pressing new social prob-
-P-A-G-E-156
132 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
lems they could not afford to wait for the rural sections of 
their States. Accordingly they sought and obtained per- 
missive city school-tax legislation, and proceeded to organ- 
ize their schools independently, incorporating them later 
into the general state organization. Thus Providence be- 
gan schools in 1800, and Newport in 1825, whereas the 
first Rhode Island general law was not enacted until 1828; 
the “Free School Society” of New York City was chartered 
by the legislature in 1805, and the first permanent state 
school law dates from 1812; Philadelphia was permitted to 
organize schools by special legislation in 1812 and 1818, 
while the first general school law for Pennsylvania dates from 
1834; Baltimore secured a special law in 1825, a year ahead 
of the first Maryland general school legislation; and Mobile 
was given special permission to organize schools in 1826, 
though the first general state school law in Alabama dates 
from 1854. 
As other examples typical of early permissive state legis- 
lation may be mentioned the Maryland law of 1816, giv- 
ing permission to the voters of Caroline County to decide 
whether they would support a school by subscription or taxa- 
tion; the New Jersey law of 1820, which permitted any 
county in the State to levy a county tax for the education of 
the children of the poor; the Missouri law of 1824, which 
permitted a district tax for schools, on written demand of two 
thirds of the voters of the district, to maintain a school the 
length of time each year the majority of the parents should 
decide; the Illinois optional tax law of 1825, nullified in 
1827 by providing that the voters might decide to raise 
only half the cost of the school by taxation, and that no man 
could be taxed for schools unless he filed his consent in writ- 
ing; the Rhode Island law of 1828, giving the towns permis- 
sion to levy a tax for schools, if they saw fit; the optional 
district tax laws of 1830 in Kentucky, 1834 in Pennsylvania, 
and 1840 in Iowa; the Mississippi optional tax law of 1846, 
which permitted a district tax only after a majority of the 
heads of families in the district had filed their consent in
-P-A-G-E-157
  BATTLE FOR FREE STATE SCHOOLS 133 
writing; and the Indiana optional county tax law of 1848. 
Many of these early laws proved to be dead letters, except 
in the few cities of the time and in a few very progressive 
communities, partly because it was made too difficult to 
initiate and too easy to prevent action, and partly because 
they were too far ahead of public sentiment to be carried 
into force. , 
The struggle to secure such legislation, weak and ineffec- 
tive as it seems to us to-day, was often hard and long. 
“Campaigns of education” had to be prepared for and car- 
ried through. Many thought that tax-supported schools 
would be dangerous for the State, harmful to individual 
good, and thoroughly undemocratic. Many did not see the 
need for schools at all, and many more were in the frame of 
_ mind of the practical New England farmer who declared 
that “the Bible and figgers is all I want my boys to know.” 
Often those in favor of taxation were bitterly assailed, and 
even at times threatened with personal violence. Henry 
Barnard, who rendered such useful service in awakening— 
Connecticut and Rhode Island, between 1837 and 18465, to 
the need for better schools, tells us that a member of the 
Rhode Island legislature told him that a bill providing a 
small state tax for schools, which he was then advocating, 
even if passed by the legislature could not be enforced in 
Rhode Island at the point of the bayonet. A Rhode Island 
farmer threatened to shoot him if he ever caught him on his 
property advocating “such heresy as the partial confisca- 
tion of one man’s property to educate another man’s child.” 
A member of the Indiana legislature, of 1837, declared that 
when he died he wanted engraved on his tombstone, “Here 
lies an enemy to free schools.” 
Growth of a public school sentiment illustrated by taxa- 
tion in Ohio. The progress of the struggle to secure taxa- 
tion for the maintenance of public schools differed somewhat 
in detail in the different States, but Ohio and Indiana offer 
us good illustrative examples — the first of a slow but 
peaceful settlement of the question, the other of a settle-

ment only after vigorous fighting. The history in Ohio 
may be summarized as follows: 
1802. State admitted to the Union. 
1806, 1816. Organization of schools permitted. Only means of 
support rents of school section lands and rate-bills. 
1821. All property of residents of district made taxable for 
schools. 
1825. Building of schoolhouses permitted; site must be donated. 
1825. A county school tax of one half mill required to be levied. 
1827. State permanent school fund created. 
1827. Building repairs limited to $300, and two thirds vote re- 
quired to authorize this expenditure. 
1829. Special organization and tax law enacted for Cincinnati. 
1831. Non-resident property-holders also made liable for district 
school taxes. 
1834. Each parent sending a child to school must provide his

Some of the older States and a number of the newer States 
have had a somewhat similar history of a slow but gradual 
education of the people to the acceptance of the burdens of 
school support. 
The battle for taxation illustrated by Indiana. Ohio was 
predominantly New England in stock (see map, p. 738), 
but Indiana represented a more mixed type of population. 
The New England element dominated the northern part of _ 
the State, and was prominent along the eastern edge and 
down the Ohio, especially near Cincinnati. The Southern | 
element was in the majority in the southern and central 
portion of the State. Between these two elements there 
was a conflict for a generation over the question of tax- 
supported schools. Even more was it a battle between 
the charity and pauper-school conception of education of the 
Southern element, and the strong-state conception of the 
New England Yankee.

BATTLE FOR FREE STATE SCHOOLS 135 
Though admitted in 1816, with a constitution making 
careful provision for a complete state system of schools (see 
p. 75), the first general school law was not enacted until 
1824. This merely authorized schools where wanted, and 
permitted their support by a district tax or by the rate-bill. 
Nothing more was done until 1836. In this year two laws 
were enacted which provided a form of compulsory town- 
ship taxation for schools. The first gave back to each town- 
ship qne fourth of its state poll taxes, and the second gave 
back five per cent of the g general st: state taxes collected therein, 
with the provision that these moneys should be used to help 
maintain schools in the townships. This was regarded as an 
entering wedge to state taxation for a system of public edu- 
cation, and was so bitterly opposed that it became the chief 
election issue_in_1837,. The opponents of tax-supported 
schools carried the day, and the legislature then elected 
met and promptly repealed the law. 
Nothing more was done until 1848. In 1847 a “State 
Common School Convention” was held, and a bill was pre- 
pared which provided for a personal poll tax of 25 cents, a 
state tax of .6 of a mill, and a similar township tax for schools. 
This was presented to the legislature of 1848, with a demand 
for action. The legislature, however, was cautious and un- 
decided, and voted to obtain first a referendum on the sub- 
ject at the elections of 1848. ‘This was done, with the result 
shown on the map on the following page. The New England 
element in the population came out strong for tax-supported 
schools, the Southern element opposing. Though 66 per 
cent of the counties and 56 per cent of the population fa- 
vored tax-supported schools, the legislature of 1849 was 
still afraid to act. Finally an optional law, providing for 
a 25-cent poll tax, a general county tax of 1 mill, and an 
insurance premium tax was enacted, with permission to levy 
additional taxes locally. The law, however, was not to apply 
to any county until accepted by the voters thereof, and a 
new referendum on the law was ordered for 1849. The vote 
in 1849 was not essentially different from that of 1848. Two

The new constitution of 1851 settled the matter, despite 
much opposition, by providing for a state tax-supported 
school system, and in 1852 the first general state school tax 
(of 1 mill) was levied on all property in the State. This 
ended the main battle in Indiana. 
The struggle to prevent misappropriation as illustrated by 
Kentucky. At approximately the same time as the struggle 
in Indiana a conflict was also taking place in Kentucky which 
was illustrative of early political standards regarding edu- 
cation and educational funds. The Kentucky Act of 1830 
ingness to bear taxation that the law remained eon 
a dead letter. In 1837 the State received $1,433,754 as a 
virtual gift from the National Government in the distri- 
bution of the so-called Surplus Revenue, and $850,000 of this 
was put into a state school fund and invested in state inter- 
nal improvement bonds. At that time an investigation 
‘showed that one half the children of school age in the State 
had never been to school, and that one third of the adult 
population GouldnoGaeed or write. 
In 1840 the State refused to pay the interest on the school 
fund bonds, and in 1845 the legislature ordered the bonds, 
destroyed and repudiated the state’s debt to the school fund. 
Now began a battle to change conditions, led by the Rever- 
end Robert J. Breckinridge, a descendant of a Scotch Cove- 
nanter who-had—come to Kentucky from Pennsylvania, 
and who became State Superintendent of Common Schools 
in 1847. He first obtained from the legislature of 1848 a  
-P-A-G-E-162

\ 
138 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
new bond for the confiscated school funds for $1,225,768, 
thus adding all unpaid interest to the principal of the bond. 
The next year he secured legislation permitting the people 
to vote at the fall elections for a two-mill state school tax, 
stumped the State for the measure, and carried the proposal 
‘by a majority of 36,882. In the constitutional convention 
of 1850 he not only secured the first constitutional mention 
of education and made provision for a state system of 
schools, but also had the debt to the state school fund 
recognized at $1,326,770, and the fund declared inviolable. 
In the legislature of 1850, against the determined opposition 
of the governor, he secured further legislation making the 
interest on the school fund due to the schools a first charge 
on any moneys in the state treasury. This closed the fight 
of ten years to force the State to be honest with and sup- 
port education in the State. Similar fights, involving school 
lands or funds, took place in some of the other States, 
though not always so successfully as in Kentucky. 
State support fixed the state system. With the begin- 
nings of state aid in any substantial sums, either from the 
income from permanent endowment funds, state appropria- 
tions, or direct state taxation, the State became, for the 
first time, in a position to enforce quite definite require- 
ments in many matters. Communities which would not 
meet the State’s requirements would receive no state funds. 
nO, One of the first requirements to be thus enforced was 
that communities or districts receiving state aid must also 
levy a local tax for schools. Commonly the requirement 
was a duplication of state aid. Generally speaking, and 
recognizing exceptions in a few States, this represents the 
beginnings of compulsory local taxation for education. As 
early as 1797 Vermont had required the towns to support 
their schools on penalty of forfeiting their share of state 
aid. New York in 1812, Delaware in 1829, and New Jersey 
in 1846 required a duplication of all state aid received. 
Wisconsin, in its first constitution of 1848, required a local 
tax for schools equal to one half the state aid received.\’The 
   
-P-A-G-E-163
RTO Aa ee eR RR ea ee Ln ee nn ere oe ee eae ees a eee 
| BATTLE FOR FREE STATE SCHOOLS 189 
next step in state control was to add still other require- 
ments, as a prerequisite to receiving state aid. One of the 
first of such was that a certain length of school term, com- 
monly three months, must be provided in each school dis- 
trict. Another was the provision of free heat, and later on 
free_school books and supplies. 
When the duplication-of-state-aid-received stage had 
been reached, compulsory local taxation for education had 
been established, and the great central battle for the crea- 
tion of a state school system had been won. The right to 
tax for support, and to compel local taxation, was the key. 
to the whole state system of education. From this pont 
on the process of evolving an adequate system of school 
support in any State has been merely the further education 
of public opinion to see new educational needs. The proc- 
ess generally has been characterized by a gradual increase 
in the amount of the required school tax, the addition of 
new forms of or units for taxation, and a broadening of the 
scope and purpose of taxation for education. The develop- 
ment has followed different lines in different States, and 
probably no two States to-day stand at exactly the same 
place in the evolution of a system of school support. So 
vital is school finance, however, that the position of any 
state school system to-day is in large part determined by 
how successful the State has been-in evolving an adequate 
system of public school support. 5 
2. The battle to-eliminate ee 
The pauper-school idea. The home of the pauper-school 
idea in America, as will be remembered from the map 
given on page 70, was the old Central and Southern States. 
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, 
and Georgia were the chief representatives, though the idea 
had friends among certain classes of the population in other 
of the older States. The new and democratic West would 
not tolerate it. The pauper-school conception was a direct 
inheritance from English rule, belonged to a society based on   
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  140 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
classes, and was wholly out of place in a Republic founded on 
the doctrine that “all men are created equal, and endowed by 
their Creator with certain inalienable rights.” Still more, 
it was a very dangerous conception of education for a demo- 
cratic form of government to tolerate or to foster. Its 
friends were found among the old aristocratic or conserva- 
tive classes, the heavy taxpayers, the supporters of church 
schools, and the proprietors of private schools. Citizens 
who had caught the spirit of the new Republic, public men 
of large vision, intelligent workingmen, and men of the New 
England type of thinking were opposed on principle to a 
plan which drew such invidious distinctions between the 
future citizens of the State. To educate part of our children 
in church or private pay schools, they said, and to segregate 
those too poor to pay tuition and educate them at public 
expense in pauper schools, often with the brand of pauper 
made very evident to them, was certain to create classes in 
society which in time would prove a serious danger to our 
democratic institutions. 
Large numbers of those for whom the pauper schools were 
intended would not brand themselves as paupers by sending 
their children to the schools, and others who accepted the 
advantages offered, for the sake of their children, despised 
the system. Concerning the system “The Philadelphia 
Society for the Establishment and Support of Charity 
Schools” in an “Address to the Public,” in 1818, said: 
In the United States the benevolence of the inhabitants has led 
to the establishment of Charity Schools, which, though affording 
individual advantages, are not likely to be followed by the political 
benefits kindly contemplated by their founders. In the country 
a parent will raise children in ignorance rather than place them in 
charity schools. It is only in large cities that charity schools suc- 
ceed to any extent. These dispositions may be improved to the 
best advantage, by the Legislature, in place of Charity Schools, 
establishing Public Schools for the education of all children, the 
offspring of the rich and the poor alike. 
The battle for the elimination of the pauper-school idea 
was fought out in the North in the States of Pennsylvania
-P-A-G-E-165
  BATTLE FOR FREE STATE SCHOOLS 141 
and New Jersey, and the struggle in these two States we 
shall now briefly describe. 
The Pennsylvania legislation. In Pennsylvania we find 
the pauper-school idea fully developed. The constitution of 
1790 (p. 64) had provided for a state system of pauper 
schools, but nothing was done to carry even this constitu- 
tional direction into effect until 1802. A pauper-school law 
was then enacted, directing the overseers of the poor to 
notify such parents as they deemed sufficiently indigent 
that, if they would declare themselves to be paupers, their 
children might be sent to some specified private or pay 
school and be given free education. The expense for this was 
assessed against the education poor-fund, which was levied 
and collected in the same manner as were road taxes or 
taxes for poor relief. No provision was made for the estab- 
lishment of public schools, even for the children of the poor, 
nor was any standard set for the education to be provided 
in the schools to which they were sent. No other general 
provision for elementary education was made in the State 
until 1834, 
With the growth of the cities, and the rise of their special 
problems, something more than this very inadequate pro- 
vision for schooling became necessary. “The Philadelphia 
Society for the Establishment and Support of Charity 
Schools” had long been urging a better system, and in 1814 
“The Society for the Promotion of a Rational System of 
Education” was organized in Philadelphia for the purpose 
of educational propaganda. Bills were prepared and pushed, 
and in 1818 Philadelphia was permitted, by special law, to 
organize as “the first school district” in the State of Penn- 
sylvania, and to provide, with its own funds, a system of 
Lancastrian schools for the education of the children of its 
poor. In 1821 the counties of Dauphin (Harrisburg), Alle- 
gheny (Pittsburg), Cumberland (Carlisle), and Lancaster 
(Lancaster) were also exempted from the state pauper-school 
law, and allowed to organize schools for the education of the 
children of their poor. 
 
-P-A-G-E-166

142 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
That this plan for the education of the children of the poor 
reached but few children in the State not otherwise pro- 
vided for was shown by a Report made to the legislature, in 
1829. At that time but 31 of the 51 counties of the State 
reported children as being educated under the poor-law 
act, and these showed that the number of poor children be- 
ing paid for had been only: 
4940, in 1825; 9014, in 1827; 
7943, in 1826; 4477, in 1828. 
There were at that time estimated to be 400,000 children 
in the State between the ages of 5 and 15, not over 150,000 
of whom were attending any kind of school. In 1833, the 
last year of the pauper-school system, the number educated 
} had increased to 17,467 for the State, and at an expense of 
$48,466.25 to the counties, or an average yearly expense per 
pupil of $2.10. No wonder the heavy taxpayers regarded 
favorably such.an inexpensive plan for public education. 
In 1824 an optional free-school law was enacted which 
permitted the organization of public schools, but provided 
that no child could attend school at public expense longer 
than three years. Even this was repealed in 1826, and the 
old pauper-school law was reinstated. 
The Law of 1834. In 1827 “The Pennsylvania Society for 
the Promotion of Public Schools” began an educational 
propaganda, which did much to bring about the Free-School 
Act of 1834. In an “Address to the Public”’ it declared its 
objects to be the promotion of public education throughout 
the State of Pennsylvania, and the “Address” closed with 
these words: :   
This Society is at present composed of about 250 members, and 
a correspondence has been commenced with 125 members, who 
reside in every district in the State. It is intended to direct the 
continued attention of the public to the importance of the subject; 
to collect and diffuse all information which may be deemed valu- 
able; and to persevere in their labors until they shall be crowned 
with success. 
 
-P-A-G-E-167

Memorials were presented to the legislature year after 
year, governors were interested, “Addresses to the Public” 
were prepared, and a vigorous propaganda was kept up 
until the Free-School Law of _1834 was the result. 
This law, though, was optional. It created every ward, 
township, and borough in the State a school district, a total 
of 987 being created for the State. Each school district

was ordered to vote that autumn on the acceptance or re- 
jection of the law. Those accepting the law were to organ- 
ize under its provisions, while those rejecting the law were to 
continue under the educational provisions of the old Pauper- 
School Act. 
The results of the school elections of 1834 are shown, by 
counties, on the above map. Of the total of 987 districts 
created, 502, in 46 of the then 52 counties (Philadelphia 
County not voting), or 52 per cent of the whole number, 
voted to accept the new law and organize under it; 264 dis-
-P-A-G-E-168
144 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
tricts, in 31 counties, or 27 per cent of the whole, voted de- 
finitely to reject the law; and 221 districts, in 46 counties, or 
21 per cent of the whole, refused to take any action either 
way. In 8 counties, indicated on the map, every district ac- 
cepted the law, and in 5 counties, also indicated, every dis- 
trict rejected or refused to act on the law. A study of this 
map, in comparison with the map given on page 73, shows 
once more the influence of the New England element settled 
along the northern border of the State. The democratic 
West, with its Scotch-Irish Presbyterian population, is also 
in evidence. It was the predominantly German counties, 
located in the east-central portion of the State, which were 
for this was that the new law provided for English schools; 
another was the objection of the thrifty Germans to taxa- 
tion; and another was the fear that the new state schools 
might injure their German_parochial schools. 
The final victory over the pauper-school forces. The real 
fight for free versus pauper schools was yet to come. Legis- 
lators who had voted for the law were bitterly assailed, 
and, though it was but an optional law, the question of its 
repeal and the reinstatement of the old Pauper-School Law 
became the burning issue of the campaign in the autumn of 
1834. Many legislators who had favored the law were de- 
feated for reélection. Others, seeing defeat, refused to run. 
Petitions for the repeal of the law, and remonstrances against 
its repeal, flooded the legislature. Some 32,000 persons 
petitioned for a repeal of the law, 66 of whom signed by 
making their mark, and “not more than five names in a 
hundred,” reported a legislative committee which inves- 
tigated the matter, “were signed in English script.” It was 
from among the Germans that the strongest opposition to 
the law came. This same committee further reported that 
so many of the names were “so illegibly written as to afford 
the strongest evidence of the deplorable disregard so long 
paid by the Legislature to the constitutional injunction to 
establish a general system of education.”
-P-A-G-E-169
BATTLE FOR FREE STATE SCHOOLS 145 
The Senate at once repealed the law, but the House, 
largely under the leadership of a Vermonter by the name 
of Thaddeus Stevens, refused to reconsider, and finally forced 
the Senate to accept an amended and a still stronger bill. 
This defeat finally settled, in principle at least, the pauper- 
school question in Pennsylvania, though it was not until 
1873 that the last district in the State accepted the new sys- 
tem. The law provided for state aid, state supervision of 
schools, and county and local taxation, but districts refusing 
to accept the new system could receive no portion of the new 
funds. During the first year a three and one-half months’ 
free school was provided. By 1836 the new free-school law 
had been accepted by 75 per cent of the districts in the 
State, by 1838 by 84 per cent, and by 1847 by 88 per cent. 
In 1848 the legislature ordered free schools in all districts, 
but, not attaching a compulsory feature to the enactment 
beyond the forfeiting of any state aid, it was twenty-five 
years longer before the last district gave in and accepted the 
law. In 1849 a four months’ free school was made neces- 
sary to receive any state aid. 
Eliminating the pauper school idea in New Jersey. No 
constitutional mention of education was made in New Jer- 
sey until 1844, and no educational legislation was passed 
until 1816. In that year a permanent. state school fund _ 
was begun, and in 1820 the first permission to levy taxes 
“for the education of such poor children as are paupers” 
was granted. In 1828 an extensive investigation showed 
that one third of the children of the State were without 
educational opportunities, and as a result of this investiga- 
tion the first general school law for the State was enacted, 
in 1829. This provided for district schools, school trustees 
and visitation, licensed teachers, local taxation, and made 
a state appropriation of $20,000 a year to help establish the 
system. The next year, however, this law was repealed 
and the old pauper-school plan reéstablished, largely due 
to the pressure of church and private-school interests. In 
1830 and 1831 the state appropriation was made divisible 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
146 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
among private and parochial schools, as well as the public 
pauper schools, and the use of all public money was limited 
“to the education of the children of the poor.” 
Between 1828 and 1838 a number of conventions of friends 
of free public schools were held in the State, and much work 
in the nature of propaganda was done. At a convention 
in 1838 a committee was appointed to prepare an “Address 
to the People of New Jersey” on the educational needs of 
the State, and speakers were sent over the State to talk to 
the people on the subject. That “every free State must 
provide for the education of all its children” was held to 
be axiomatic. The pauper-school idea was vigorously con- 
demned. Concerning this the “Address” said: 
We utterly repudiate as unworthy, not of freemen only, but of 
men, the narrow notion that there is to be an education for the 
poor as such. Has God provided for the poor a coarser earth, a 
thinner air, a paler sky? Does not the glorious sun pour down his 
golden flood as cheerily on the poor man’s hovel as upon the rich 
man’s palace? Have not the cotter’s children as keen a sense of 
all the freshness, verdure, fragrance, melody, and beauty of luxu- 
riant nature as the pale sons of kings? Or is it on the mind that 
God has stamped the imprint of a baser birth, so that the poor 
man’s child knows with an inborn certainty that his lot is to crawl, 
not climb? It is not so. God has not done it. Man cannot do 
it. Mind is immortal. Mind is imperial. It bears no mark of 
high or low, of rich or poor. It asks but freedom. It requires but 
light. 
The campaign against the pauper school had just been 
fought to a conclusion in Pennsylvania, and the result of 
the appeal in New Jersey was such a popular manifestation 
in favor of free schools that the legislature of 1838 insti- 
tuted a partial state school system. The pauper-school 
laws were repealed, and the best features of the short-lived 
Law of 1829 were reénacted. In 1844 a new state constitu- 
tion limited the income of the permanent state school fund 
exclusively to the support of public schools. 
With the pauper-school idea eliminated from Pennsylvania
-P-A-G-E-171
BATTLE FOR FREE STATE SCHOOLS 147 
and New Jersey, the North was through with it. The wis- 
dom of its elimination soon became evident, and we hear 
little more of it among Northern people. The democratic 
West never tolerated it. It continued some time longer in 
Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia, and at places for a time 
in other Southern States, but finally disappeared in the 
South as well in the educational reoroniin ni plc 
place following the close of the Civil War. > ee ie 
3. The battle to make the schools ee 
The schools not yet free. The rate-bill, as we have pre- 
viously stated, was an old institution, also brought over 
from England, as the term “rate” signifies. It was, as we 
have said, a charge levied upon the parent to supplement 
the school revenues and prolong the school term, and was 
assessed in proportion to the number of children sent by each 
parent to the school. In some States, as for example Mas- 
sachusetts and Connecticut, its use went back to colonial 
times; in others it was added as the cost for education in- 
creased, and it was seen that the income from permanent 
funds and authorized taxation was not sufficient to maintain 
the school the necessary length of time. The deficiency 
in revenue was charged against the parents sending chil- 
dren to school, pro rata, and collected as ordinary tax-bills, 
The charge was small, but it was sufficient to keep many 
poor children away from the schools. 
This is well illustrated by the case of New York City, 
where The Public School Society, finding its funds inade- 
quate to meet its growing responsibilities, attempted, in 
1826, to raise additional funds by adding the rate-bill for 
those who could afford to pay. The rates were moderate, 
as may be seen from the following schedule of charges:

Two days before the system went into effect there were 
3457 pupils in the schools of the Society, six months later 
there were but 2999, while the number taking the $2 per 
quarter studies dropped from 137 to 13. The amount re- 
ceived from fees in 1826 was $4426, but by 1831 this had 
fallen to $1366. What to do was obvious, and, securing ad- 
ditional funds, the schools were made absolutely free again 
in 1832. 
The rising cities, with their new social problems, could 
not and would not tolerate the rate-bill system, and one by 
one they secured special laws from legislatures which en- 
abled them to organize a city school system, separate from 
city council control, and under a local “board of educa- 
tion.” One of the provisions of these special laws nearly 
always was the right to levy a city tax for schools sufficient 
to provide free education for the children of the city. 
In New York State, to illustrate, we find special legis- 
lation, which provided free schools for the city, enacted as

The State of New York did not provide for free schools 
generally until 1867. In other States, it might be added, 
that the schools in Providence, Baltimore, Charleston, 
Mobile, New Orleans, Louisville, Cincinnati, Chicago, and 
Detroit were free for about a quarter-century before the 
coming of free state schools.

BATTLE FOR FREE STATE SCHOOLS 149 
The fight against the rate-bill in New York. The attempt 
to abolish the rate-bill and make the schools wholly free was 
most vigorously contested in New York State, and the con- 
test there is most easily described. From 1828 to 1868, this 
tax on the parents produced an average annual sum of $410,- 
685.66, or about one half of the sum paid all the teachers of 
the State for salary. While the wealthy districts were se- 
curing special legislation and taxing themselves to provide 
free schools for their children, the poorer and less populous 
districts were left to struggle to maintain their schools the 
four months each year necessary to secure state aid. Fi- 
nally, after much agitation, and a number of appeals to the 
legislature to assume the rate-bill charges in the form of gen- 
eral state taxation, and thus make the schools entirely free, 
the legislature, in 1849, referred the matter back to the 
. people to be voted on at,the elections that autumn. The 
legislature was to be thus advised by the people as to what 
action it should take. The result was a state-wide cam- 
paign for free, public, tax-supported schools, as against 
partially free, rate-bill schools. 
The result of the 1849 election was a vote of 249,872 in 
favor of making “the property of the State educate the chil- 
dren of the State,” and 91,952 against it. This only seemed 
to stir the opponents of free schools to renewed action, and 
they induced the next legislature to resubmit the question for 
another vote, in the autumn of 1850. 
The result of the referendum of 1850 is shown on the next 
map. ‘The opponents of tax-supported schools now mus- 
tered their full strength, doubling their vote in 1849, while 
the majority for free schools was materially cut down. The 
interesting thing shown on this map was the clear and un- 
mistakable voice of the cities. They would not tolerate 
the rate-bill, and, despite their larger property interests, 
they favored tax-supported free schools. The rural dis- 
tricts, on the other hand, strange to say, opposed the idea. 
We have here clearly set forth a growing conflict between 
city and rural interests, in matters of education, which con-
-P-A-G-E-174

tinued to become more acute with time. The cities de- 
manded educational progress and were determined to have 
it, regardless of cost. If it could be had by general legisla-

tion, in which the whole State shared, well and good; if not, 
then special laws and special taxing privileges would be 
sought and obtained. The result of this attitude, clearly 
shown in the New York referendum of 1850, was that the 
substantial progress in almost every phase of public educa- 
tion during the second half of the nineteenth century was 
made by the cities of our country, while the rural districts 
lagged far behind.
-P-A-G-E-175
  BATTLE FOR FREE STATE SCHOOLS 161 
The rate-bill in other States. These two referenda vir- 
tually settled the question in New York, though for a time 
~ a compromise was adopted. The state appropriation for 
schools was very materially increased, the rate-bill was re- 
tained, and the organization of “union districts” to provide 
free schools by local taxation where people desired them was 
authorized. Many of these “union free districts” now 
arose in the more progressive communities of the State, and 
finally, in 1867, after rural and other forms of opposition 
had largely subsided, and after almost all the older States 
had abandoned the plan, the New York legislature finally 
abolished the rate-bill and made the schools of New York 
entirely free. 
The dates for the abolition of the rate-bill in the other 
older Northern States were: 
1834. Pennsylvania. 1867. New York. 
1852. Indiana. 1868. Connecticut. 
1853. Ohio. 1868, Rhode Island. 
1855. Tlinois. 1869. Michigan. 
1864. Vermont. 1871. New Jersey. 
The New York fight of 1849 and 1850 was the pivotal fight; 
in the other States it was abandoned by legislative act, 
and without a serious contest. In the Southern States free 
education came with the educational reorganizations fol- 
lowing the close of the Civil War. 
Other school charges. Another per-capita tax usually 
levied on parents, in the early days of public education, was 
the fuel or wood tax. Unless each parent had hauled, or 
paid some one to do so, his proper “quota of wood” to the 
schoolhouse during the summer, it was assessed against him 
as was the rate-bill. This was vexatious, because small, 
and often hard to collect. Finally State after State aban- 
doned the charge and assessed it, with other necessary ex- 
penses, against the property of the school district, thus mak- 
ing wood or coal a public charge. 
The provision of textbooks has been another charge gradu- 
ally assumed by cities and States. The earliest provision 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  152 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
of free textbooks, as in the case of free schooling, was made 
by the cities. The earliest city to provide free textbooks 
was probably Philadelphia, in 1818. New Hampshire or- 
dered free textbooks for indigent children as early as 1827. 
Jersey City began to provide free textbooks in 1830, and 
Newark in 1838. Charleston, South Carolina, began in 
1856; and Elizabeth and Hoboken, New Jersey, some time 
before 1860. Massachusetts gave permission to furnish 
free textbooks in 1873, and made them obligatory in 1884. 
Maine followed in 1889, and New Hampshire in 1890. Many 
other States have since ordered free textbooks provided 
for their schools. 
Free school supplies — pens, ink, paper, pencils — have 
also been shifted gradually from an individual charge to 
general taxation, and, within recent years, as we shall see 
in later chapters, many new charges have been assumed 
by the public as in the interests of better school edu- 
cation.

THE BATTLE TO CONTROL THE SYSTEM

— continued 
4. The battle to establish school supervision 
Local nature of all early schools. The history of our edu- 
cational evolution as so far described must have clearly re- 
vealed to the reader how completely local the evolution of 
schools has been with us. Everywhere development has 
been from the community outward and upward, and not 
from the State downward. At first the schools were those 
of individual teachers, churches, philanthropic societies, 
towns, or districts, organized and maintained without any 
thought of connection or state relationship. Even in Massa- 
chusetts and Connecticut the local nature of the education 
provided was one of its marked characteristics. 
After the New England towns, in response to the demand 
for greater local rights and local control of affairs, had split 
their town governments up into fragments, known at first as 
parishes and later as school districts, as described in Chap- 
ter II, and after the Massachusetts district school system 
thus evolved had been confirmed in the new state laws 
(1789) it spread to other States, and soon became the almost 
universal unit for school organization and control. ..The 
reasons for its early popularity are not hard to find. It was 
well suited to the primitive needs and conditions of our 
early national life. Among a sparse and hard-working rural 
population, between whom intercourse was limited and in- 
tercommunication difficult, and with whom the support of 
schools by taxation was as yet an unsettled question, it 
answered a very real need. The simplicity and democracy 
of the system was one of its chief merits. Communities or  
-P-A-G-E-180
156 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
neighborhoods which wanted schools and were willing to 
pay for them could easily meet and organize a school dis- 
trict, vote to levy a school tax on their own property, em- 
ploy a teacher, and organize and maintain a school. On 
the other hand, communities which did not desire schools 
or were unwilling to tax themselves for them could do with- 
out them, and let the free-school idea alone. The first state 
laws generally, as we have pointed out in Chapter V, were 
permissive in nature and not mandatory, and under these 
permissive laws the progressive communities of each State 
gradually organized a series of local schools. These have 
since been brought together into township, county, and state 
organizations to form the state systems which we know 
to-day. 
The schools thus established would naturally retain their 
local character so long as their support was entirely local. 
Schools might even be ordered established, as in the case of 
the town schools of Massachusetts and Connecticut, or the 
pauper schools of Pennsylvania, and, so long as the State 
contributed nothing to their maintenance, their organiza- 
tion, management, and control would almost of necessity 
be left to local initiative. The more progressive commu- 
nities would obey the law and provide schools supported 
largely or wholly by taxation; the unwilling communities 
would either ignore the law or provide schools dependent 
upon tuition fees and rate-bills. 
Beginnings of state control. The great battle for state 
schools, which we have briefly described in the preceding 
chapter, was not only for taxation to stimulate their devel- 
“opment where none existed, but was also indirectly a battle 
for some form of state control of the local systems which had 
already grown up. [The establishment of permanent state 
school funds by the older States, to supplement any other 
aid which might be granted, also tended toward the estab- 
lishment of some form of state supervision and control of the 
local school systems.] Under the early permissive laws all 
state aid for schools might of course be rejected, and fre-
-P-A-G-E-181
    BATTLE TO CONTROL THE SYSTEM 167 
quently was, and usually large option and power of initia- 
tiye had at first to be left to the local units, but the State, 
(once any aid from permanent state endowment funds or any 
form of state taxation was accepted by a community school 
system, was now in position to make and enforce demands 
ip_return-for the state aid granted) In return for the state 
aid accepted the local school authorities must now make 
reports as to attendance, length of term, kind of teacher, 
and income and expenses, and”must comply with the re- 
quirements of the state school laws as to district meetings, 
levying of local taxes to supplement the state aid, subjects 
to be taught, certificate for the teacher, and other similar 
matters. The acceptance of state aid inevitably meant a 
small but a gradually increasing state control. The first step 
, was the establishment of some form of state aid; the next was 
the imposing of conditions necessary to secure this state aid. 
State oversight and control, however, does not exercise 
itself, and it soon became evident that the States must 
elect or appoint some officer to tfepresent the State and en- 
force the observance of its demands. It would be primarily 
his duty to see that the laws relating to schools were carried 
cout, that statistics as to existing conditions were collected 
and printed, and that communities were properly advised as 
to their duties and the legislature as to the needs of the State. 
We find now the creation of a series of school officers to 
represent the State, the enactment of new laws extending 
control, and a struggle to integrate, subordinate, and reduce 
to some semblance of a state school system the hundreds 
of community school systems which had grown up. The 
communities were usually very willing to accept the state 
aid offered, but many of them resented bitterly any attempt 
to curb their power to do as they pleased, or to force them 
to make reports and meet general state requirements. 
The first state school officers. The first American State 
to create a state officer to exercise supervision over its schools 
was New York, in 1812. It will be remembered that this 
State had enacted an experimental school law, and made an
-P-A-G-E-182
158 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
annual state grant for schools, from 1795 to 1800. Then, 
unable to reénact the law, the system was allowed to lapse 
and was not reéstablished until the New England element 
gained control, in 1812. In enacting the new law providing 
for state aid for schools the first State Superintendent of 
Common Schools in the United States was created. So far 
as is known this was a distinctively American creation, unin- 
fluenced by the practice in any other land. It was to be 
the duty of this officer to look after the establishment and 
maintenance of the schools throughout the State. By his 
vigorous work in behalf of schools the first appointee, 
Gideon Hawley, gave such offense to the politicians of the 
time that he was removed from office, in 1821, and the 
legislature then abolished the position and designated the 
Secretary of State to act, ex officio, as Superintendent. This 
condition continued until 1854, when New York again 
created the separate office of Superintendent of Public In- 
struction. Maryland created the office in 1826, but two 
years later abolished it and did not re-create it until 1864. 
Illinois directed its Secretary of State to act, ex officio, as 
Superintendent of Schools in 1825, as did also Vermont in 
1827, Louisiana in 1833, Pennsylvania in 1834, and Tennes- 
see in 1835. Illinois did not create a real State Superintend- 
ent of Schools, though, until 1854, Vermont until 1845, 
Louisiana until 1847, Pennsylvania until 1857, or Tennes- 
see until 1867. 
The first States to create separate school officials who 
have been continued to the present time were Michigan 
and Kentucky, both in 1837. Influenced by Cousin’s Re- 
port (Chapter IX) on the organization of schools in Prussia, 
the leaders in the Michigan constitutional convention of 
1835 — Pierce and Crary — insisted on the title of Super- 
intendent of Public Instruction and on constitutional pro- 
visions which would insure, from an administrative point 
of view, a state school system rather than a series of local 
systems of schools. Kentucky, on the other hand, evolved, 
as had New York, a purely American-type official, known  
-P-A-G-E-183
  BATTLE TO CONTROL THE SYSTEM 159 
as Superintendent of Common Schools. The Michigan 
title in time came to be the one commonly used, though few 
States in adopting it have been aware of its Prussian origin. 
Other States followed these, creating a state school officer 
under one of a number of titles, and in some States, such 
as Connecticut, Ohio, Iowa, and Missouri, the office was 
created, abolished, and re-created one or more times before 
it became permanently established. Often quite a legisla- 
tive struggle took place to secure the establishment of the 
office, and later on to prevent its ‘abolition.

By 1850 there were ex-officio state school officers in nine, 
and regular school officers in seven, of the then thirty-one 
States, and by 1861 there were ex-officio officers in nine and 
regular officers in nineteen of the then thirty-four States, 
as well as one of each in two of the organized Territories.

state school officer was created. The map also shows the 
ten of the thirty-four States which had, by 1861, also created 
the office of County Superintendent of Schools, as well as 
the twenty-five cities which had, by 1861, created the office 
of City Superintendent of Schools. Only three more cities 
— Albany, Washington, and Kansas City — were added 
before 1870, making a total of twenty-eight, but since that 
date the number of city superintendents has increased to 
something like fourteen hundred to-day. 
Early duties; selection by election. The office of State 
Superintendent of Common Schools, Superintendent of 
Free Schools, Superintendent of Education, Superintendent 
of Public Instruction, or Commissioner of Education — 
terms which are significant of the educational evolution _ 
through which we have passed — was thus evolved with us 
to represent the State in its dealings with the local school 
systems to which it now proposed to extend some financial 
aid. At the time the office arose there were few of our 
present-day problems to be solved, and the early functions 
attached to the office were almost exclusively clerical,-statis- 
tical, and exhortatory. These early functions have become 
crystallized in the laws and have formed the traditions of 
the office. Even more have they formed the traditions of 
y-the office of County Superintendent of Schools. To collect, 
tabulate, and edit the school statistics as to attendance, 
teachers, term, and finances demanded by the law; to ad- 
vise as to the law; to apportion the state aid to the school 
districts; to visit the different counties and advise the local 
‘school authorities; to exhort the people to found and improve 
their schools; and to advise the legislature as to the condi- 
tion and needs of the schools, — these constituted the chief 
duties of these early officials. With time, and with the 
gradual change in the popular conception as to the place and 
purpose of public education, so many new duties have been 
added to the office that it has now come to be conceived of 
in an entirely new light. 
[She creation of these new state officials came just at the   ——~. -
-P-A-G-E-185
BATTLE TO CONTROL THE SYSTEM _—161 
time when the rising democratic consciousness and distrust 
of legislatures and governors had reached its height, and 
when the belief in the ability of the people to select all their 
public servants had reached, with the general attainment 
of full manhood suffrage, a maximum.| The appointed city 
school superintendent had not as yet arisen to point the 
way to a better method of selection, — there were but ten 
such in the United States by 1850, — the analogy to a state 
auditor or a county clerk seemed clear, the expert functions 
which now ought to characterize the office had not devel- 
oped, and nomination and election by the people seemed the 
perfectly natural method to follow. In consequence, al- 
most everywhere these new state and county officials were 
placed in the elective column, instead of being appointed 
to office. Even in the cities the elective method was at 
first tried, though all but one have now discarded it a: 
means for selecting a city superintendent of school Ta 
the earlier period, when the duties of these new officials 
were far simpler than they now are, and when almost no 
        uch better results than it does oe in New 
and was a better method followed froni the first. 
Curbing the district system. One of the chief duties of 
these early state school officials, aside from the collection 
of statistics and exhorting the people to establish and main- 
tain schools, was that of trying to institute some control 
over the local school communities, and the introduction 
of some uniformity into.school_praetices. By the time the 
States began to create state and county school officers, the 
‘Massachusetts district system, the origin of which we de- 
scribed in Chapter II, had overrun the country. The first 
school law enacted by Massachusetts (1789) recognized and 
legalized the district system of school organization and con- 
trol, as it had evolved in the State during the preceding 
hundred years. In 1800 the districts were given full local 
power to tax for schools; in 1817 full power was given them
-P-A-G-E-186
  162 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
to contract and to sue and be sued; and in 1827 the full cul-— 
mination of the district system was attained by laws which 
authorized the districts to select district school trustees, 
and gave to these trustees the power to choose the textbooks 
and employ and certificate their teachers. 
Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and 
Connecticut also accepted the district system early. It 
spread to New York in 1812, and was carried by New Eng- 
land people in their great migration toward the West and 
South. Ohio definitely accepted the district system of 
organization in 1821, Illinois in 1825, Tennessee in 1830, 
Indiana in 1833, Michigan in 1837, Kentucky and Iowa in 
1838, North Carolina in 1839, and Virginia in its optional 
law of 1846. Once established amid pioneer people it be- 
came firmly rooted, and has since been changed only after 
much effort, though almost all the conditions which gave 
rise to it have since passed away. 
In most of the States the system soon ran rampant. The 
district meeting became a forensic center in which ques- 
tions the most’ remote and personal animosities of long 
standing were fought out. Petty local interests and a “dog- 
in-the-manger spirit” too often prevailed, to the great detri- 
ment of the schools. District jealousies prevented needed 
development. An exaggerated-idea of district rights, dis- 
trict importance, and district perfection became common. 
District independence was often carried to a great extreme. 
In Massachusetts, for example, Horace Mann found that in 
two thirds of the towns teachers were allowed to begin teach- 
ing without any examination or certification, and frequently 
were paid without either; that the trustees refused generally 
to require uniform textbooks, or to furnish-them to poor, 
children, as required by.the law; and that one third of the 
children of school age in the State were absent from school 
in the winter and two fifths in the summer, without the 
trustees concerning themselves in any way about the situa- 
tion. In Ohio the trustees “forbade the teaching of any 
branches except reading, writing, and arithmetic,” and in
-P-A-G-E-187
  BATTLE TO CONTROL THE SYSTEM 163 
1840 the early laws requiring schools in the English language 
were repealed, and the districts were permitted to authorize 
schools in the German language. In Indiana the system 
went to such an extreme as almost to destroy the schools. 
In 1836 and 1837 laws were passed which permitted house- 
holders to make individual contracts with teachers to teach 
their children, and in 1841 the requirement of any form of 
a teacher’s certificate was made optional with the district 
trustees. In many States school district trustees were 
allowed to determine what subjects should be taught and 
how, and the people determined who should teach and how 
long a term of school should be maintained. 
To enforce reports giving statistics as to the schools, to 
enforce local-taxation to supplement the state aid, to enforce 
the requirement of some form of a teacher’s certificate, to 
see that the school subjects required in the law were taught 
in the schools, and that the schools were maintained at least 
the length of time demanded by the State, were among the 
early functions of these state, county, and township school 
superintendents. All these were important as establishing 
some form of state control over the school districts, and 
marked the beginnings of their integration into a series of 
county and state school systems. 
Creating supervision in Massachusetts. The struggle to 
subordinate and control the district system is well illus- 
trated by the history of Massachusetts. Once foremost in 
general education, a great decline had set in after the com- 
ing of statehood, and this decline continued steadily up to 
about 1826, The decline in the importance of its schools 
was closely paralleled by the growth in importance of the 
district system of school control. The growth of manu- 
facturing, the social changes in the cities, and the philan- 
thropic and humanitarian movements we have described in 
Chapter IV, all tended in Massachusetts, as elsewhere, to 
awaken an educational consciousness and a demand for 
educational reform. As early as 1821 a young Harvard 
graduate and teacher, by the name of James G. Carter
-P-A-G-E-188
AS ck gh id SBE ic i ia aa A EES aa i 
164 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
(1795-1845), had published a series of Letters... on the 
Free Schools of New England. In these letters the glaring 
defects of the district system and the decline in importance 
of the schools were pointed out. Deeply impressed with 
conditions, he soon became a leader in educational propa- 
ganda and educational reform. 
The first result of the agitation he started was the law of 
1826, whereby each town (township) was required to ap- 
point a Town School Committee (School Board) to exercise 
general supervision over all the district schools in the town, 
: select the textbooks, and examine and certificate all the 
teachers employed. This law met with bitter opposition 
from many districts, it being regarded as an infringement 
of district “rights.” In 1834 the state school fund was 
created, and to share in its income all towns were required 
to raise a town tax of one dollar per child and to make sta- 
tistical reports as required. In 1837 came the culmina- 
tion of Mr. Carter’s labors, when he secured passage of a 
bill creating the first real State Board of Education in 
the United States. Instead of following the practice of 
the time, and creating an elected State Superintendent of 
Schools, Mr. Carter, much more wisely, provided for a 
small appointed State Board of Education which in turn 
was to select a Secretary, who was to act in the capacity 
of a state school officer and report to the Board, and through 
it to the legislature and the people. Neither the Board nor 
the Secretary were given any powers of compulsion, their 
work being to investigate conditions, report facts, expose 
defects, and make recommendations as to action to the 
     
    legislature, “The permanence and influence of the Board 
‘thus’ mded very largely on the character of the Secre- 
it selected. 
The new Secretary and his problems. A prominent 
Brown University graduate and lawyer in the State Senate, 
by the name of Horace Mann (1796-1859), who as president 
of the Senate had been of much assistance in securing pas- 
sage of the bill creating the State Board of Education, was
-P-A-G-E-189
RE Re Tee re Ce ee ee 
BATTLE TO CONTROL THE SYSTEM 165 
finally induced by the Governor and the Board to accept 
the position of Secretary. He entered on his duties in June, 
1837. The choice proved to be a particularly fortunate one, 
as Mr. Mann possessed the characteristics needed for such 
an office — enthusiasm, courage, vision, lofty ideals, and 
practical legislative experience. Few State Superintend- 
ents of Public Education since his time have risen to a 
higher conception of the importance of their office, and his 
career forms a worthy study for any one interested in educa- 
tional leadership. He gave up a promising career in the 
law and in politics to accept the office at a beggarly salary 
that often left him without money for his dinner, but, once 
he had made up his mind to do so, he entered upon the 
work with all the energy he possessed. To a friend he 
wrote: 
My law books are for sale. My office is to let. The bar is no 
longer my forum. I have abandoned jurisprudence and betaken 
myself to the larger sphere of mind and morals. 
On the day he accepted the office he wrote in his diary: 
Henceforth so long as I hold this office I devote myself to the 
supremest welfare of mankind upon earth. . . . I have faith in the 
improvability of the race — in their accelerating improvability. 
This effort may do, apparently, but little. But mere beginning a 
good cause is never little. If we can get this vast wheel into any 
perceptible motion, we shall have accomplished much. 
| The problems which Mr. Mann faced, growing out of bad 
legislation in the past and the resulting state of affairs, are 
thus stated by Hinsdale: 
1. The whole State needed to be thoroughly aroused to the 
importance and value of public instruction. 
2. The public schools needed to be democratized; that is, the 
time had more than come when they should be restored to the 
people of the State, high as well as low, in the good old sense of - 
the name. 
8. The public necessities demanded an expansion of public 
education in respect to kinds of schools and range of instruction. 
4. The legal school organization and machinery, as existing,  
-P-A-G-E-190

| 166 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
were not in harmony with the new social conditions. Moreover, 
current methods of administration were loose and unbusinesslike. 
5. The available school funds were quite insufficient for main- 
taining good schools, and called loudly for augmentation. 
6. The schools were, to a great extent, antiquated and outgrown 
in respect to the quantity and quality of the instruction that they 
furnished, as well as in methods of teaching, management, dis- 
cipline, and supervision. 
The work of Horace Mann. Mr. Mann now began a 
most memorable work of educating public opinion, and soon 
became the acknowledged leader in school organization in 
the United States. State after State called upon him for 
advice and counsel, while his twelve annual Reports to the 
State Board of Education will always remain memorable 
documents. Public men of all classes — lawyers, clergy- 
men, college professors, literary men, teachers — were laid 
under tribute and sent forth over the State explaining to the 
people the need for a reawakening of educational interest in 
Massachusetts. Every year Mr. Mann organized a “cam- 
paign.” It resembled somewhat the recent national cam- 
paign to explain to our people the meaning and moral signifi- 
cance of our participation in the World War in Europe. 
So successful was he, and so ripe was the time for such a 
movement, that he not only started a great common school 
revival in Massachusetts which led to the regeneration of 
the schools there, but one which was felt and which influ- 
enced development in every Northern State. 
His controversy with the Boston schoolmasters, whose 
sensibilities he had wounded by his praise of European 
schools, attracted much attention, made a deep impression 
on the public mind, and did much to fix Mr. Mann’s place 
in educational history. \_His controversy with the religious 
societies marked the beginning of the struggle in the United 
States for non-sectarian schools. Everywhere he preached 
the doctrine of liberal taxation for public education, with 
the result that during the twelve years of his secretaryship 
the appropriations for public education were more than
-P-A-G-E-191
BATTLE TO CONTROL THE SYSTEM 167 
doubled, salaries of teachers greatly increased, and a full 
month added to the length of the school term. He organ- 
ized the first three state normal-schools.in-America, and 
some of the earliest teachers’ institutes. He labored con- 
tinually at the improvement of teaching method, and espe- 
cially worked/for the introduction of Pestalozzian reforms 
and the substitution of the word-method in teaching reading 
for the slow, wasteful, and unintelligent alphabet method. 
He edited the Massachusetts Common School Journal, wrote 
a careful report on schoolhouse hygiene, introduced school 
libraries throughout the State, and stimulated the develop- 
ment of the high school.. In his hands the printed “school 
returns,” first required by the law of 1826, became “ power- 
ful instruments in educating the public.” His vigorous 
condemnation of the district system, to which he devoted 
his fourth Report, contributed to its ultimate abandonment. 
The Massachusetts Law of 1789, which legalized it, he 
repeatedly stated to have been “the most unfortunate law 
on the subject of common schools ever enacted in the State,” 
and he declared that “no substantial and general progress 
can be made so long as the district system exists.”” So en- 
trenched was the system “behind statutory rights and im- 
memorial usage” that it required thirty years longer to free 
the State from its inimical influence. 
His twelve carefully written Reports on the condition of 
education in Massachusetts and elsewhere, with his intelli- 
gent discussion of the aims and purposes of public educa- 
tion, occupy a commanding place in the history of American 
education, while he will always be regarded as perhaps the 
greatest of the “founders” of our American system of free 
public schools. No one did more than he to establish in 
the minds of the American people_the conception that edu- 
cation should be universal, non-sectarian, and free, and that 
its aim should be social efficiency, civic virtue, and charac- 
ter, rather than mere learning or the advancement of sec- 
tarian ends. Under his practical leadership an unorganized 
and heterogeneous series of community school systems was
-P-A-G-E-192
168 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED. STATES 
reduced to organization and welded together into a state 
school system, and the people of Massachusetts were effec- 
_ tively recalled to their ancient belief in and duty toward 
the education of the people. 
Henry Barnard in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Al- 
most equally important, though of a somewhat different 
character, was the work of Henry Barnard in Connecticut 
and Rhode Island. A graduate of Yale, and also educated 
for the law, he turned aside to teach and became deeply 
interested in education. The years 1835-37 he spent in 
Europe studying schools, particularly the work of Pesta- 
lozzi’s disciples. On his return to America he was elected 
a member of the Connecticut legislature, and at once formu- 
lated and secured passage of the Connecticut law (1839) 
providing for a State Board of Commissioners for Common 
Schools, with a Secretary, after the Massachusetts plan. 
Mr. Barnard was then elected as its first Secretary, and 
reluctantly gave up the law and accepted the position at 
the munificent salary of $3 a day and expenses. Until the 
legislature abolished both the Board and the position, in 
1842, he rendered for Connecticut a service scarcely less 
important than the better-known reforms which Horace 
Mann was at that time carrying on in Massachusetts. 
It will be remembered that Connecticut had established 
a state school fund as early as 1750, and on the sale of the 
Western Reserve for $1,200,000, in 1795, had added this 
sum to the fund. The fund experienced excellent manage- 
ment, and by the time of the creation of the State Board 
had reached nearly $2,000,000,in value, producing a yearly 
income large enough to pay a substantial portion of the then 
cost of maintaining the schools. -This had made the people 
negligent as to taxation, and this, combined with the grow- 
ing strength of the district system, led to a decline in 
interest in education in Connecticut similar to that which 
had taken place in Massachusetts. The schools were poor, 
private schools were increasing, the people objected to taxa- 
tion, the teachers were without training or professional
-P-A-G-E-193
BATTLE TO CONTROL THE SYSTEM 169 
interest, the pauper-school idea began to be advocated, and 
a general decline in educational affairs had set in. An 
investigation, made in 1838, showed that not one half of 
the children of the State were attending school. From 
probably the best schools of any State at the end of the 
colonial period, the Connecticut schools had fallen to a very 
inferior position. 
It was the work of Barnard to recall Connecticut to her 
ancient duty. He visited and inspected the schools, and 
made many public addresses. In 1839 he organized the 
first first teachers” institute-in America which met for more than 
a few days (his was for six weeks, with daily instruction in 
classes), and he used this new instrument extensively to 
awaken the teachers of the State to proper conceptions of 
their work. He established the Connecticut Common School 
Journal to disseminate his ideas. He also organized school” 
libraries, and urged the establishment of evening schools. 
He strove to improve the physical condition of the schools 
by writing much on schoolhouse construction. He studied 
the “school returns,” and used the statistical data to arouse 
interest. In 1842, through the animus of a governor who 
objected to the “useless expense,” and the “dangerous 
innovation” of union schools to provide advanced educa- 
tion, the Board was abolished, the laws repealed, and Mr. 
Barnard was legislated out of office. 
In 1843 he was called to Rhode Island to examine and 
report upon the existing schools, and from 1845 to 1849 
acted as State Commissioner of Public Schools there, where 
he rendered a service similar to that previously rendered in 
Connecticut. In addition he organized a series of town 
libraries throughout the State. For his teachers’ institutes 
he devised a traveling model school, to give demonstration 
lessons in the art of teaching. From 1851 to 1855 he was 
again in Connecticut, as principal of the newly established 
state normal school and ex-officio Secretary of the Connecti- 
cut State Board of Education. He now rewrote the school 
laws, increased taxation for schools, checked the power of

the districts, there known as “school societies,” and laid 
the foundations of a state system of schools. 
Barnard as the scholar of the ‘‘ awakening.” In 1855 
he began the editing of his famous American Journal of 
Education, a vast encyclopedia of educational information 
which finally reached thirty-one volumes. In this venture 
he sunk his entire private fortune, and in his old age was a 
poor man. The collection still remains a great storehouse 
of educational information and biography, covering almost 
every phase of the history of education from the earliest 
times down to 1870. It gave to American educators, who 
had so long been isolated and who had been slowly evolving 
a thoroughly native school system out of the English inher- 
itance, a needed conception of historical development in 
other lands and a useful knowledge of recent development 
and practice in other lands and nations. From 1858 to 1860 
he served as president of the University of Wisconsin, and 
from 1867 to 1870 as the first United States Cornmissioner 
of Education. He published much, was distinctively the 
scholar of the great public school awakening of the second 
quarter of the nineteenth century, and was closely associ- 
ated with the most progressive movements in American 
education for approximately forty years. Mann and Bar- 
nard stand out as the two conspicuous leaders during the 
formative period of American education. Mann-in-particu- 
lar pointed the way to-many subsequent—referms—in_the 
administration of public education, while to Barnard we owe 
a special debt as our first great educational scholar. 
The ‘‘ awakening ” elsewhere; the leaders. The work 
of Mann and Barnard had its influence throughout all the 
Northern States, and encouraged the friends of education 
everywhere. Almost contemporaneous with them were 
leaders in other States who helped fight through the battles 
of state establishment and state organization and control, 
among the more prominent of whom should be mentioned 
Calvin Stowe, Samuel Lewis, and Samuel Galloway in 
Ohio; Caleb Mills in Indiana; Ninian W. Edwards in Illi-

It is not perhaps without its significance, as showing the 
enduring influence of the Calvinistic educational traditions, 
that of these Stowe was a graduate of Bowdoin College in 
Maine, and that the Stowe family goes back to 1634, in 
Roxbury, Massachusetts; that Lewis was born in Massa- 
chusetts, was descended from one of the first colonists in 
Plymouth, and floated down the Ohio with his parents to 
Cincinnati in the great westward migration of New Eng- 
land people; that Galloway was of Scotch-Irish ancestry, and 
was educated among New England people in Ohio; that 
Mills was born in New Hampshire, and had been graduated 
from Dartmouth; that Pierce was born in New Hampshire, 
educated in Massachusetts, and had been graduated from 
Brown; that Crary was of Puritan ancestry, born and edu- 
cated in Connecticut, and a graduate of Trinity College; 
that Breckinridge was a descendant of a Scotch Covenanter 
who fled to America, at the time of the restoration of the 
Stuarts in England, and settled in Pennsylvania; that Wiley 
was of early Scotch-Irish Presbyterian stock ; and that Swett 
was born and educated in New Hampshire, taught school 
in Massachusetts in the days of Horace Mann, and was 
descended from a family of that name which landed at 
Massachusetts Bay in 1642. x oy SE 
5. The battle to eliminate sectarianism 
The secularization of American education. The Church, 
it will be remembered, was with us from the earliest colonial 
times in possession of the education of the young. Not 
only were the earliest schools controlled by the Church and 
dominated by the religious motive, but the right of the 
Church to dictate the teaching in the schools was clearly 
recognized by the State. Still more, the State looked to 
the Church to provide the necessary education, and assisted 
it in doing so by donations of land and money. The min-
-P-A-G-E-198
172 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
ister, as a town official, naturally examined the teachers and 
the instruction in the schools. After the establishment of 
our National Government this relationship for a time con- 
tinued. New York and the New England States specifi- 
cally set aside lands to help both church and school. When 
Connecticut sold its Western Reserve, in 1795, and added 
the sum to the Connecticut school fund, it was stated to be 
for the aid of “schools and the gospel.”’ In the sales of the 
first national lands in Ohio (1,500,000 acres to The Ohio 
Company, in 1787; and 1,000,000 acres in the Symmes Pur- 
chase, near Cincinnati, in 1788), section 16 in each town- 
ship was reserved and given as an endowment for schools, 
and. section 29 “for the purposes of religion.” After about 
1800 these land endowments for religion ceased, but grants 
of state aid for religious schools continued for nearly a half- 
century longer. Then it became common for a town or city 
to build a schoolhouse from city taxation, and let it out rent- 
free to any responsible person who would conduct a tuition 
school in it, with a few free places for selected poor children. 
Still later, with the rise of the state schools, it became quite 
common to take over church and private schools and aid 
them on the same basis as the new state schools. 
In colonial times, too, and for some decades into our na- 
tional period, the warmest advocates of the establishment 
of schools were those who had in view the needs of the 
Church. Then gradually the emphasis shifted, as we have 
shown in Chapter ITI, to the needs of the State, and a new 
class of advocates of public education now arose. Still 
later the emphasis has been shifted to industrial and civic 
and national needs, and the religious aim has been almost 
completely eliminated. This change is known as the sec- 
ularization of American education. It also required many 
a bitter struggle, and was accomplished in the different 
States but slowly. The two great factors which served 
to produce this change have been: 
1. The conviction that the life of the Republic demands an 
educated and intelligent citizenship, and hence the general
-P-A-G-E-199
  BATTLE TO CONTROL THE SYSTEM 173 
education of all in common schools controlled by the State; 
and 
2. The great diversity of religious beliefs among our people, 
which has forced tolerance and religious freedom through a 
consideration of the rights of minorities. 
The secularization of education with us must not be re- 
garded either as a deliberate or a wanton violation of the 
rights of the Church, but rather as an unavoidable incident 
connected with the coming to self-consciousness and self- 
government of a great people. 
So long as there was little intercommunication and mi- 
gration, and the people of a community remained fairly 
homogeneous, it was perfectly natural that the common 
religious faith of the people should enter into the instruction 
of the school. When the schools were purely local and 
voluntary this was not a serious objection. With the rise 
of state support, and the widening of the units for main- 
tenance and control from the lone community or district 
to the town, the county, and the State, the situation changed. 
With the coming of foreign immigration, which began to be 
marked after about 1825, and the intermingling of peoples 
of different faiths in the rapidly evolving cities, religious 
uniformity ceased to exist. Majority rule now for a time 
followed, but this was soon forced to give way to the still 
more important governmental principle of religious free- 
dom. As necessity gradually compelled the State to provide 
education for its children, sectarian differences made it in- 
creasingly evident that the education provided must be 
non-sectarian in character. As Brown (S. W.) has so well 
stated it: 
Differences of religious belief and a sound regard on the part of 
the State for individual freedom in religious matters, coupled with 
the necessity for centralization and uniformity, rather than hos- 
tility to religion as such, lie at the bottom of the movement toward 
the secular school. 
Gradual nature of the change. The change to non-sec- 
tarian schools came very gradually, and it is hard to assign a
-P-A-G-E-200
  174 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
date for its beginning. The chart between pages 44 and 
45, showing the process of evolving the civic out of the ear- 
lier religious schools, discloses a gradual fading out of reli- 
gious influence and control during the eighteenth century, 
and the gradual assumption of state control early in the nine- 
“teenth century. The change began early in our national 
- history —in a way it 
was but a sequel to the 
waning religious interest 
which characterized the

change in the character 
of instruction, marked by a decreasing emphasis on the re-

English Tongue, after about 1760; the publication of Noah 
Webster’s American Spelling Book, a combined speller and 
reader, in 1783; and the Columbian Primer and the Franklin 
Primer, in 1802; soon broke the almost exclusive hold of the 
New England Primer, with its Shorter Catechism, on the 
schools. By 1806 the Primer had been discarded in the dame 
schools of Boston, as well as in the lower schools in most 
other cities, though it continued to be used in the rural dis- 
tricts until near the beginning of the second quarter of the 
nineteenth century. Other American textbooks, more liter- 
ary and less religious in character, also helped along the pro- 
cess of change. Some of the more prominent of these were 
Caleb Bingham’s American Preceptor (1794) and Columbian 
Orator (1806), Lindley Murray’s Grammar (1795), and the 
Franklin Primer (1802). Readings from these new books 
now took the place of readings from the Bible.

The “Tancastrion schools also gave but little sitention to 
religious instruction as such, though having religious exer- 
cises, and these, it will be remembered, became for a time 
exceedingly popular throughout the country. The most 
significant single fact, and one clearly expressive of the proc- 
ess which had for long been under way, was the Massa- 
chusetts Act of 1827 which declared that School Committees 
should “never direct to be used or purchased in any of the 
town schools any school books which were calculated to 
favor the tenets of any particular sect of Christians.” This 
Act merely registered what the slow operation of public 
opinion had already decided. In 1833 Massachusetts gave 
up taxing for church support, as had Connecticut in 1818. 
The fight in Massachusetts. The educational awakening 
in Massachusetts, brought on by the work of Carter and 
Mann, was to many a rude awakening. Among other 
things, it revealed that the old school of the Puritans had 
gradually been replaced by a new and purely American 
type of school, with instruction adapted to democratic and 
national rather than religious ends.\Mr. Mann stood 
strongly for such a conception of public ediiication; and being 
a Unitarian, and the new State Board of Education being 
almost entirely liberal in religion, an attack was launched 
against them, and for the first time in our history the cry 
was raised that “The public schools are Godless schools.” 
Those who believed in the old system of religious instruc- 
tion, those who bore the Board or its Secretary personal ill- 
will, and those who desired to break down the Board’s au- 
thority and stop the development of the public schools, 
united their forces in this first big attack against secular 
education. Horace Mann was the first prominent educator 
in America to meet and answer the religious onsl. 
A violent attack was opened in both the pulpit eae the 
press. It was claimed that the Board was trying to elimi- 
nate the Bible from the schools, to abolish correction, and to 
“make the schools a counterpoise to religious instruction at 
home and in Sabbath schools.” The local right to demand
-P-A-G-E-202
  
1%6 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
religious instruction was insisted upon. Even as conserva- 
tive a journal as the Princeton Review declared: 
The people of each school district have the right to make the 
schools as religious as they please; and if they cannot agree they 
have the right severally of withdrawing their proper proportion 
of the public stock of funds. 
Mr. Mann felt that a great public issue had been raised 
which should be answered carefully and fully. In three 
public letters and in one of his Reports he answered, the 
criticisms and pointed out the errors in the argument.) The 
Bible, he said, was an invaluable book for forming the char- 
acter of children, and should be read without comment in the 
schools, but it was not necessary to teach it there. He 
showed that most of the towns had given up the teaching 
of the Catechism before the establishment of the Board 
of Education. He contended that any attempt to decide 
what creed or doctrine should be taught would mean the 
ruin of the schools/~ 
The attack culminated in the attempts of the religious 
forces to abolish the State Board of Education, in the legis- 
latures of 1840 and 1841, which failed dismally.. Most of 
the orthodox people of the State took, Mr. Mann’s side, and 
Governor Briggs, in one of his messages, commended his 
stand by inserting the following: 
Justice to a faithful public officer leads me to say that the inde- 
fatigable and accomplished Secretary of the Board of Education 
has performed services in the cause of common schools which will 
earn him the lasting gratitude of the generation to which he 
belongs. 
The attempt to divide the school funds. As was stated 
earlier, in the beginning it was common to aid church schools 
on the same basis as the state schools, and sometimes, in the 
beginnings of state aid, the money was distributed among 
existing schools without at first establishing any public 
schools. In many Eastern cities church schools at first 
shared in the public funds. In Pennsylvania church and 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  BATTLE TO CONTROL THE SYSTEM 177 
private schools were aided from poor-law funds up to 1834, 
In New Jersey the first general school law of 1829 had been 
repealed a year later through the united efforts of church 
and private school interests, who fought the development 
of state schools, and in 1830 and 1831 new laws had _per- 
mitted all private and parochial schools to share in the small 
state appropriation for education. 
After the beginning of the forties, when the Roman Catho- 
lic influence came in strongly with the increase in Irish 
immigration to the United States, a new factor was intro- 
duced and the problem, which had previously been a Pro- 
testant problem, took on a somewhat different aspect. 
Largely through the demands of the Catholics one of the 
most interesting fights in the whole process of secularizing 
American education was precipitated in the City of New 
York. 
It will be remembered that the Public School Society, 
founded in 1805, had become the greatest single educational 
organization in the city, and had received state money, 
after 1807, to assist it in its work. In 1820 the Bethel 
Baptist Church was admitted to a share in the state appro- 
priation. To this the Public School Society objected, and 
the legislature in 1825 turned over the quota of New York 
City to the city council, to divide as it thought best. The 
council cut off the Baptist schools, three of which were by 
that time running, and refused to grant public money to 
any religious society. In 1828 the Public School Society 
was permitted to levy a local tax to supplement its resources, 
it being estimated that at that time there were 10,000 chil- 
dren in the city with no opportunities for education. The 
Society was regarded as a non-denominational organization, 
though chartered to teach “the sublime truths of religion 
and morality contained in the Holy Scriptures” in its 
schools. | 
In 1831 the Catholic Orphan Asylum applied to the city 
council for a grant of funds, which was allowed. The 
Methodists at once applied for a similar grant, and were 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
ee ee 
178 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
refused. The religious question now became more and more 
prominent, though without any progress being made toward 
its settlement. By 1840 the Massachusetts conflict was on, 
and in that year Governor Seward, of New York, urged the 
establishment of schools in the cities of the State in which 
the teachers should be of the same language and religion as 
the foreign patrons. This dangerous proposal encouraged 
the Catholics, and they immediately applied to the New 
York City council for a division of the city school fund, and, 
on being refused, carried their demand to the legislature of 
the State. A Hebrew and a Scotch Presbyterian Church 
also applied for their share, and supported the Catholics in 
their demands. On the other hand the Methodists, Epis- 
copalians, Baptists, Dutch Reformed, and Reformed Pres- 
byterians united with the Public School Society in opposing 
all such divison of the funds. 
The legislature deferred action until 1842, and then did 
the unexpected thing. The heated discussion of the ques- 
tion in the city and in the legislature had made it evident 
that, while it might not be desirable to continue to give 
funds to a privately organized corporation, to divide them 
among the quarreling and envious religious sects would be 
much worse. The result was that the legislature created for 
the city a City Board of Education, to establish real public 
schools, and stopped the debate on the question of aid to 
religious schools by enacting that no portion of the school 
funds was in the future to be given to any school in which 
“any religious sectarian doctrine or tenet should be taught, 
inculcated, or practiced.’ Thus the real public school sys- 
tem of New York City was evolved out of this attempt to 
divide the public funds among the churches. The Public 
School Society continued for a time, but its work was now 
done, and in 1853 it surrendered its buildings and property 
to the City Board of Education and disbanded. 
The contest in other States. As early as 1830, Lowell, 
Massachusetts, had granted aid to the Irish Catholic 
parochial schools in the city, and in 1835 had taken over
-P-A-G-E-205
BATTLE TO CONTROL THE SYSTEM 179 
two such schools and maintained them as public schools. 
In 1853 the representatives of the Roman Catholic Church 
made a demand on the state legislature for a division of the 
school fund of the State. To settle the question once for 
all a constitutional amendment was submitted by the legis- 
lature to the people, providing that all state and town 
moneys raised or appropriated for education must be ex- 
pended only on regularly organized and conducted public 
schools, and that no religious sect should ever share in such 
funds. This measure failed of adoption at the election of 
1853 by a vote of 65,111 for and 65,512 against, but was 
re-proposed and adopted in 1855. This settled the question 
in Massachusetts, as Mann had tried to settle it earlier, and 
as New Hampshire had settled it in its constitution of 1792 
and Connecticut in its constitution of 1818. 
Other States now faced similar demands, but no demand 
for a share in or a division of the public school funds, after 
1840, was successful. The demand everywhere met with 
intense opposition, and with the coming of enormous num- 
bers of Irish Catholics after 1846, and German Lutherans 
after 1848, the question of the preservation as unified state 
school systems of the schools just established now became 
a burning one. Petitions deluged the legislatures, and these 
were met by counter-petitions. Mass meetings on both sides 
of the question were held. Candidates for office were forced 
to declare themselves. Anti-Catholic riots occurred in a 
number of cities. The Native American Party was formed, 
in 1841, “to prevent the union of Church and State,” and 
to “keep the Bible in the schools.” In 1841 the Whig 
Party, in New York, inserted a plank in its platform against 
sectarian schools. In 1855 the national council of the Know- 
Nothing Party, meeting in Philadelphia, in its platform 
favored public schools and the use of the Bible therein, but 
opposed sectarian schools. This party carried the elections 
that year in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, 
Rhode Island, Maryland, and Kentucky. 
To settle the question in a final manner legislatures now

began to propose constitutional amendments to the people 
of their several States which forbade a division or a diver- 
sion of the funds, and these were almost uniformly adopted 
at the first election after being proposed. The States, with 
the date of adoption of such a constitutional prohibition, are:

A In 1875 President Grant, in his message to Congress, 
urged the submission of an amendment to the Federal Con- 
stitution making it the duty of the States to support free 
public schools, free from religious teaching, and forbidding 
the diversion of school funds to church or sectarian pur- 
poses. Ina later message he renewed the recommendation, 
but Congress took no action because it considered such 
action unnecessary. That the people had thoroughly de- 
cided that the schoolfunds must be kept intact and the 
system of free public schools preserved may be inferred 
from the fact that no State admitted to the Union after

1858, excepting West Virginia, failed to insert such a pro- 
vision in its first state constitution. Hence the question 
may be regarded as a settled one in our American States. 
Our people mean to keep the public school system united 
as one state school system, well realizing that any attempt 
to divide the schools among the different religious denomina- 
tions (The World Almanac for 1917 lists 49 different denom- 
inations and 171 different sects in the United States) could 
only lead to inefficiency and educational chaos.

. Explain why with us schools naturally developed from the community 
outward. 
. Why did state organization and compulsion eventually become 
necessary? 
. Do state support and state control always go together? 
. State your explanation for the older States beginning to establish 
permanent school funds, often before they had established a state 
system of schools. 
. What was the reason the local school communities so resented state 
control, when anxious to accept state funds? 
. Compare the duties of the chief state school officer in your state to- 
day with those described for the early state officials. 
. Explain how the different titles for the chief state school officer, 
given on page 160, are “significant of the educational development 
through which we have passed.” 
. Explain how the district system naturally became what it did. 
. Show the gradual transition from church control of education, through 
state aid of church schools, to, secularized state schools. 
Show why secularized state schools were the only possible solution 
for the United States. 
Show that the quotation from Brown, on page 173, represents the 
statesman-like manner in which we have handled the question. 
Show that secularization would naturally take place in the textbooks 
and the instruction before manifesting itself in the laws. 
What would be the effect on education if every one followed the 
declaration of the writer in the Princeton Review (p. 176)? Would 
the attempt of the Catholics to divide the school funds have resulted 
in the same thing? 
What would have been the probable result had the New York legis- 
lature followed Governor Seward’s recommendation? 
Would a good system of high schools ever have been possible had we 
divided the school funds among the churches?

6. The battle to establish the American high school 
Tue elementary or common schools which we have seen 
had been established in the different States, by 1850, sup- 
plied an elementary or common-school education to the 
children of the masses of the people, and the primary schools 
which, as we have also seen, were added, after about 1820, 
carried this education downward to the needs of the begin- 
ners. In the rural schools the American school of the 3-Rs 
provided for all the children, from the little ones up, so long 
as they could advantageously partake of its instruction. 
Education in advance of this common school training was 
in semi-private institutions — the academies and colleges — 
in which a tuition fee was charged. The next struggle came 
in the attempt to extend the system upward so as to pro- 
vide to pupils, free of charge, a more complete education 
than the common schools afforded. 
The transition Academy. About the middle of the 
eighteenth century a tendency manifested itself, in Europe 
as well as in America, to establish higher schools offering a 
more practical curriculum than the old Latin schools had 
provided. In America it became particularly evident, after 
the coming of nationality, that the old Latin grammar- 
school type of instruction, with its limited curriculum and 
exclusively college-preparatory ends, was wholly inadequate 
for the needs of the youth of the land. The result was the 
gradual dying out of the Latin school and the evolution of 
the tuition Academy, previously referred to briefly at the 
close of Chapter III.

Franklin’s Academy at Philadelphia, which began instruc- 
tion in 1751 with three organized departments — the_Latin, 
School, the English School, and the Mathematical School — 
and which later evolved into the University of Pennsylvania, 
was probably the first American academy. Others claim 
the honor of earlier establishment, but this is the first the 
foundation of which is perfectly clear. The first academies 
“in Massachusetts were the Dummer Academy, in South 
Byfield, founded in 1761, and opened for instruction in 1763; 
and the Phillips Academy 
at Andover, founded in 
1778, and opened for in- 
struction in 1780. The 
academy movement spread 
rapidly during the first 
half of the nineteenth cen- 
tury. By 1800 there were 
17 academies in Massa- 
chusetts, 36 by 1820, and 
403 by 1850. By 1830 there 
were, according to Hins- 
dale, 950 incorporated 
academies ins the United Pittsfield Academy, New Hampshire, where States, and many unincor- John Swett went to school. 
porated ones, and by 1850, 
according to Inglis, there were, of all kinds, 1007 academies 
in New England, 1636 in the Middle Atlantic States, 2640 
in the Southern States, 753 in the Upper Mississippi Valley 
States, and a total reported for the entire United States of 
6085, with 12,260 teachers employed and 263,096 pupils 
enrolled. The movement gained a firm hold everywhere 
east of the Missouri River, the States incorporating the 
largest number being New York with 887, Pennsylvania 
with 524, Massachusetts with 403, Kentucky with 330, 
Virginia with 317, North Carolina with 272, and Tennessee 
with 264. Some States, as Kentucky and Indiana, provided 
for a system of county academies, while many States ex-

tended to them some form of state aid. In New York State 
they found a warm advocate in Governor De Witt Clinton, 
who urged (1827) that they be located at the county towns 
of the State to give a practical scientific education suited 
to the wants of farmers, merchants, and mechanics, and also 
to train teachers for the schools of the State. The greatest 
period of their development was from 1820 to 1830, though 
they continued to dominate secondary education until 1850, 
and were very prominent until after the Civil War. 
Characteristic features. The most characteristic features 
of these academies were their semi-publiccontrol, their 
broadened curriculum and religious purpose, and the exten- 
sion of their instruction to girls. The Latin Grammar 
School was essentially a town free school, maintained by 
the towns for the higher education of certain of their male 
children. It was aristocratic in type, and belonged to the 
early period of class education. With the decline in zeal for 
education, after 1750, these tax-supported higher schools 
largely died out, and in their place private energy and 
benevolence came to be depended upon to supply the needed 
higher education. Many of the earlier foundations were 
from estates left by will for the purpose by some public- 
spirited citizen, and others were organized by private sub- 
scriptions, or as private stock companies. A few others 
were organized along denominational lines, and were under 
ecclesiastical control. Practically all charged a tuition fee 
and most of them had dormitories and boarding halls. ‘The 
board-of trustees Was Usually a local privaté corporation, 
usually reported’to the state school authorities, and often 
was constituted as a self-perpetuating body. Many of these 
academies became semi-state institutions through the state 
aid extended to them. 
One of the main purposes expressed in the endowment or 
creation of the academies was the establishment of courses 
which should cover a number of subjects having value aside 
from_mere preparation for college, particularly subjects of 
a modern nature, useful in preparing youths for the changed. [en 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  BATTLE TO EXTEND THE SYSTEM 187 
conditions of society and government and business. The 
study of real things rather than words about things, and- 
useful things rather than subjects merely preparatory to 
college, became prominent features of the new courses of 
study. The new emphasis given to the study_of English, 
mathematics, and book-science is noticeable. New subjects 
appeared in proportion as the academies increased in num- 
bers and importance. Of 149 new subjects for study appear- 
ing in the academies of New York; between 1787 and 1870, 
23 appeared before 1826, 100 between 1826 and 1840, and 
26 after 1840. Between 1825 and 1828 one half of the new 
subjects appeared. This also was the maximum period of 
development of the academies. Among the most com- 
monly found new subjects were algebra, astronomy, botany, 
chemistry, general history, United States history, English 
literature, surveying, intellectual philosophy, declamation, 
debating, etc. 
Not being bound up with the colleges, as the earlier Latin 
grammar schools had largely been, the academies became 
primarily independent institutions, taking pupils who had 
completed the English education of the common school and 
giving them an advanced education in modern languages, 
the sciences, mathematics, history, and the more useful 
subjects of the time, with a view to “rounding out” their 
studies and preparing them for business life and the rising 
professions. They thus_built upon instead of running 
parallel to the common school course, as the old Latin gram- 
mar school had done (see Fig. 23, p. 99), and hence 
clearly mark a transition from the aristocratic and some- 
what exclusive college-preparatory Latin grammar school 
of colonial times to the more democratic high school of to- 
day. The academies also-served a very useful purpose in 
supplying to the lower schools the best-educated teachers 
of the-time.. Governor Clinton strongly urged their exten- 
sion because of their teacher-training value. They offered 
no instruction in pedagogy, except in rare instances, but be- 
cause of their advanced instruction in subjects related to
-P-A-G-E-214

188 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
the work of the common school they served as the fore» 
runners of the normal schools. 
In religious matters, too, the academies also represent 
such a transition. They were nearly always pervaded by a 
genuine religious spirit, but were usually kept free from the 
doctrines of any particular church. The foundation grant 
of one of the earliest, the Phillips Academy, at Andover, 
Massachusetts, states well this broader religious purpose. 
The aim of the Academy was to be 
to lay the foundation of a public free school or ACADEMY for 
the purposes of instructing Youth, not only in English and Latin 
Grammar, Writing, Arithmetic, and those Sciences wherein they 
are commonly taught; but more especially to learn them the 
GREAT END AND REAL BUSINESS OF LIVING ... it is 
again declared that the first and principle object of this Institution 
is the promotion of TRUE PIETY and VIRTUE; the second, in- 
struction in the English, Latin, and Greek Languages, together 
with Writing, Arithmetic, Music, and the Art of Speaking; the 
third, practical Geometry, Logic, and Geography; and the fourth, 
such other liberal Arts and Sciences or Languages, as opportunity 
and ability may hereafter admit, and as the TRUSTEES shall 
direct. 
Though this breathes a deep religious spirit it does not evi- 
dence a narrow denominationalism, and this was a char- 
acteristic of the academies. They bridged over the transi- 
tion from the ecclesiasticism of the Latin grammar schools 
of colonial times to the secularized high school of the present. 
The old Latin grammar school, too, had been maintained 
exclusively for boys. Girls had been excluded as “Im- 
proper & inconsistent w‘ such a Grammar Schoole as y* law 
injoines, and is y° Designe of thisSettlemt.” The new acad- 
emies soon reversed this situation. Almost from the first 
they began to be established for girls as well as boys, and - 
in time many became co-educational. In New York State 
alone 32 academies were incorporated between 1819 and 
1853 with the prefix “Female” to their title. In this re- 
spect, also, these institutions formed a transition to the mod- 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
BATTLE TO EXTEND THE SYSTEM 189 
ern co-educational high school. The higher education of 
women in the United States clearly dates from the estab- 
lishment of the academies. Troy (New York) Seminary, 
founded by Emma Willard, in 1821, and Mt. Holyoke 
(Massachusetts) Seminary, founded by Mary Lyon, in 
1836, though not the first institutions for girls, were never- 
theless important pioneers in the higher education of women. 
The demand for higher schools. The different move- 
ments tending toward the building up of free public school 
systems in the cities and States, which we have described 
in the two preceding chapters, and which became clearly 
defined in the Northern States after 1825, came just at the 
time when the Academy had reached its maximum develop- 
ment. The settlement of the question of general taxation 
for education, the elimination of the rate-bill by the cities 
and later by the States, the establishment of the American 
common school as the result of a long native evolution 
(Fig. 23, p. 99), and the complete establishment of public 
control over the entire elementary-school system, all tended 
to bring the semi-private tuition academy into question. 
Many asked why not extend the public school system up- 
ward to provide the necessary higher education for all in 
one common state-supported school. The existence of a 
number of colleges, basing their entrance requirements 
on the completion of the classical course of the academy, 
and the establishment of a few embryo state universi- 
ties in the new States of the West and the South, naturally 
raised the further question of why there should be a gap 
in the public school system. The increase of wealth in the 
cities tended to increase the number who passed through 
the elementary course and could profit by more extended 
education; the academies had popularized the idea of more 
advanced education; while the new manufacturing and com- 
mercial activities of the time called for more training than 
the elementary schools afforded, and of a different type from 
that demanded for entrance by the small colleges of the 
time.

  190 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
The demand for an upward extension of the public school, 
which would provide academy instruction for the poor as 
well as the rich, and in one common public higher school, 
now made itself felt. As the colonial Latin grammar school 
had represented the educational needs of a society based on 
classes, and the academies had represented a transition 
period and marked the growth of a middle class, so the ris- 
ing democracy of the second quarter of the nineteenth cen- 
tury now demanded and obtained the democratic high 
school, supported by the public and equally open to all, to 
meet the educational needs of a new society built on the 
basis of a new and aggressive de- 
mocracy. Where, too, the academy 
had represented in a way a mis- 
sionary effort — that of a few pro- 
viding something for the good of 
the people — the high school on the 
other hand represented a codpera- 
tive effort on the part of the people 
«to provide something for them-

Ronee ww tHe UNITED Jnown as the “English Classical 
Established at Boston in ise, 5ChOol,” but in 1824 the school ap- 
pears in the records as the “Eng- 
lish High School.” The name seems to be Scotch in origin, 
having been suggested by the description of the High School 
at Edinburgh, by Professor Griscom, in an article in the 
North American Review, then published in Boston, in Jan- 
uary, 1824. In 1826 Boston also opened the first high 
school for girls, but abolished it in 1828, due to its great 
popularity, and instead extended the. coitrse irse_of study for 
girls in the elementary schools. 
The matter of establishing an English high school was    
-P-A-G-E-217
  BATTLE TO EXTEND THE SYSTEM 191 
first considered in 1820, and a committee was appointed to 
consider the matter further. This committee reported, in 
January, 1821, among other things, that: 
The mode of education now adopted, and the branches of knowl- 
edge that are taught at our English grammar [elementary] 
schools are not sufficiently extensive nor otherwise calculated to 
bring the powers of the mind into operation nor to qualify a youth 
to fill usefully and respectably many of the stations, both public 
and private, in which he may be placed. A parent who wishes to 
give a child an education that shall fit him for active life, and shall 
serve as a foundation for eminence in his profession, whether 
mercantile or mechanical, is under the necessity of giving him a 
different education from any which our public schools can now 
* furnish. Hence many children are separated from their parents 
and sent to private academies in the vicinity, to acquire that 
instruction which cannot be obtained at the public seminaries. 
The report recommended the establishment of a new 
type of higher school. The report was approved; the 
course of study as recommended was adopted; and the 
school was opened in May, 1821, as a three-year high school. 
Boys to be admitted were required to be at least twelve 
years of age, instead of nine, as in the Latin grammar school 
(see “Fig. 42, p. 226), and to “be well acquainted with 
reading, writing, English grammar in all its branches, and 
arithmetic as far as simple proportion.” ‘Three years later 
English literature and geography were added. The teach- 
ers were regained to have bem educated at some_univer-—. 
sity. No other Janguage than ish was to be taught; 
English, declamation, science, mathematics and ‘its appli- 
cations, history, and logic were the principal studies. The 
course of instruction was definitely built upon that of the 
English reading and writing and grammar schools, instead 
of paralleling these. It was in consequence clearly Ameri- . . . . . 
can in nature and purpose, rejecting entirely the English 
parallel-class-education idea of the Latin grammar school. 
The aim of the school, too, as stated in the report of the com- 
mittee, was quite practical. This aim was restated in the a

Regulations of the School Committee for the school, adopted 
in 1833, which read: 
It was instituted in 1821, with the design of furnishing the young 
men of the city who are not intended for a collegiate course-of 
study, and who have enjoyed the usual advantages of the other 
public schools, with the means of completing a good English edu- 
cation to fit them for active life or qualify them for eminence in 
private or public station.

Josiah Quincy, who was mayor of Boston at the time of the 
establishment of the school, gives further corroborative evi- 
dence, in his Municipal History of the Town and City of 
Boston, as to the purpose in establishing the new high school. 
He say: 
In 1820 an English Classical School was established, having for 
its object to enable the mercantile and mechanical classes to 
obtain an education adapted for those children, whom their parents 
wished to qualify for active life, and thus relieye them from the 
necessity of incurring the expense incident to private academies.
-P-A-G-E-219
    
BATTLE TO EXTEND THE SYSTEM 198 
The free public high school thus arose, to provide at pub- 
lic expense what the public schools had failed to provide, 
and had been provided privately. The history of many an 
extension of public education since that day has had a simi- 
lar origin. 
This same conception of the aim and purpose of the new 
high school is well expressed in the First Annual Report 
of the High School Society of New York City, which opened 
a public high school there in 1825. This document reads: 
It should never be forgotten, that the grand object of this insti- 
tution is to prepare the boys for such advancement, and such pur- 
suits in life, as they are destined to after leaving it.. All who enter 
the school do not intend to remain for the same period of time — 
and many who leave it expect to enter immediately upon the active 
business of life. It is very plain that these circumstances must 
require corresponding classifications of scholars and of studies. 
Some pursuits are nevertheless common to all. All the scholars 
in this department attend to Spelling, Writing, Arithmetic, 
Geography, Elocution, Composition, Drawing, Philosophy, Nat- 
ural History, and Book-Keeping. Philosophy and Natural His- 
tory are taught chiefly by lectures and by questions; and these 
branches, together with Elocution and Composition, are severally 
attended to one day in every week. 
The Massachusetts Law of 1827. Though Portland, 
Maine, established a high school in 1821; Worcester, Massa~- 
chusetts, in 1824; and New Bedford, Haverhill, and Salem, 
Massachusetts, in 1827; copying the Boston idea, the real 
beginning of the American high school as a distinct insti- 
tution dates from Ssachusetts Law , enacted 
through the influence of James G-Carter.~ This law formed 
the basis of all subsequent legislation in Massachusetts, and 
deeply influenced development in other States. The law 
is significant in that it required a high school in every town

-P-A-G-E-220
  194 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
logic must be added. A heavy penalty was attached for failure 
tScomply with the law. In1835 the law was amended so as 
to permit any smaller town to Tone high school as well. 
This Boston and Massachusetts legislation clearly initi- 
ated aepatalia athalaesaea or ts United States. 
It was there that the new type of higher school was founded, 
there that its curriculum was outlined, there that its stand- 
ards were established, and there that it developed earliest 
and best. With two or three exceptions the high schools 
of the United States, says Inglis, 
owe the basis of their aim, theory, and practice to the high school 
first created and earliest developed in Massachusetts. As in most 
other educational matters, Massachusetts led the way in the older 
Latin grammar school education and in the newer type of second- 
ary education — the public high school. It is all the more to 
her glory that no direct influence from other countries has been 
traced in regard to the high school system. The American high 
school was an institution peculiarly adapted to the needs and 
wants of the American people, and is an everlasting tribute to the 
democracy of Massachusetts and America.

dates of which seem certain, may be mentioned the fol- 
lowing:

Established by city ordinance in 1838. In 1843 a superintendent of schools was employed, this building dedicated, and the high school opened, with the superintendent acting as its principal. The floor plan shows how completely it was a teacher-and-textbook high school, Almost all high school buildings erected before 1860 were of this type. 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
  196 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
The struggle to establish and maintain high schools. The 
development of the American high school, even in its home, 
was slow. Up to 1840 not much more than a dozen high 
schools had been established in Massachusetts, and not 
more than an equal number in the other States. The Acad- 
emy was the dominant institution, the district system for 
common schools stood in the way of any higher develop- 
ment, the cost of maintenance was a factor, and the same 
opposition to an extension of taxation to include high schools 
was manifested as was earlier shown toward the establish- 
ment of common schools. The early state legislation, as 
had been the case with the common schools, was nearly al- 
ways permissive and not mandatory. Massachusetts forms 
a notable exception in this regard. The support for the 
schools had to come practically entirely from increased local 
taxation, and this made the struggle to establish and main- 
tain high schools in any State FE a long time a series of 
local struggles. Years of propaganda and patient effort were 
required, and, after the establishment of a high school in a 
community, constant watchfulness was necessary to prevent 
its abandonment. Many of the early schools ran for a 
time, then were discontinued for a period, and later were 
reéstablished. In an address given at the dedication of a 
new building at Norwich, Connecticut, in 1856, one of the 
founders of the school thus describes these early struggles 
to establish and maintain high schools: 
. .. The lower schools up to the grade of the grammar school 
were well sustained. Men were to be found in all our communities 
who had been themselves educated up to that point, and under- 
stood, practically, the importance of such schools, in sufficient 
numbers to control popular sentiment, and secure for them ample 
appropriations and steady support. But the studies of the high 
school, Algebra, Geometry, Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, 
Ancient History, Latin, Greek, French and German, were a perfect 
terra incognita to the great mass of the people. While the High 
School was a new thing and while a few enlightened citizens had 
the control of it, in numerous instances it was carried to a high
-P-A-G-E-225
  (BATTLE TO EXTEND THE s¥sTEM) (9?) 
state of perfection. But after a time the burden of taxation would 
begin to be felt. Men would discuss the high salaries paid to the 
accomplished teachers which such schools demand, and would ask, 
“To what purpose is this waste?” Demagogues, keen-scented as 
wolves, would snuff the prey. ‘‘ What do we want of a High School 
to teach rich men’s children?” they would shout. “It is a shame 
to tax the poor man to pay a man $1800 to teach the children to 
make.z’s and pot-hooks and gabble parley-vous.” The work 
would go bravely on; and on election day, amid great excitement, 
a new school committee would be chosen, in favor of retrenchment 
and popular rights. In a single day the fruit of years of labor 
would be destroyed. 
The struggle to establish and maintain high schools in 
Massachusetts and New York preceded the development 
in most other States, because there the common school 
had been established earlier. In consequence, the struggle 
to extend and complete the public school system came 
there earlier also. The development was likewise more 
peaceful there, and came more rapidly. In Massachusetts 
this was in large part a result of the educational awakening 
started by James G. Carter and Horace Mann. In New 
York it was due to the early support of Governor De Witt 
Clinton, and the later encouragement and state aid which 
came from the Regents of the University of the State of 
New York. Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire were 
like Massachusetts in spirit, and followed closely its ex- 
ample. In Rhode Island and New Jersey, due to old condi- 
tions, and in Connecticut, due to the great decline in educa- 
tion there after 1800, the high school developed much more 
slowly, and it was not until after 1865 that any marked de- 
velopment took place in these States. The democratic West 
soon adopted the idea, and established high schools as soon 
as cities developed and the needs of the population war- 
ranted. In the South the main high school development 
dates from relatively recent times. 
Establishing the high school by court decisions. In many 
States, legislation providing for the establishment of high 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
198 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
schools was more difficult to secure than in New England 
and New York, and often when secured was afterward at- 
tacked in the courts. In most of the States shown on the 
map in Figure 35, west of New England and New York, the 
constitutionality of the establishment of the high school 
or of taxation therefor was at some time attacked in the 
courts and decided in favor of the schools.

Based on the table given in the Report of the United States Commissioner af Education, 1904, vol. 11, pp. 1782-1989. ‘This table is only approximately correct, as exact information is difficult to obtain. This table gives $21 high schools by 1860, and all but 35 of these were in the States shown on the above map. There were two schools in California and three in ‘Texas, and the remainder not shown were in the Southern States. On the $21 high schools reported, over half (167) were in the three States of Massachusetts (78), New York (41), and Ohio (48). Compare the distribution of high schools shown on this map with the dis- tribution of New England people shown on the map on page 73. 
. One of the clearest cases of this came in Michigan, in 
1872, and the verdict of the Supreme Court of that State 
was so positive that it influenced all subsequent decisions 
in other States. The case is commonly known as the Kala- 
mazoo case. The city of Kalamazoo, in 1872, voted to es-
-P-A-G-E-227
BATTLE TO\EXTEND THE SYSTEM 199 
  
  tablish a high schoo! of employ a superintendent of schools, 
and levied additional school taxes to cover the expense. 
A citizen by the name of Stuart brought suit to prevent the 
collection of the additional taxes. The case was carried to 
the Supreme Court of the State, and the decision was written 
by Chief Justice Cooley. After stating the case in-hand, the 
contention of the plaintiff that high schools were not com- 
prehended_under the heading “common schools,” and 
that the district board should supervise the schools, and 
after reviewing the educational history of the State, the 
court concluded: 
If these facts do not demonstrate clearly and conclusively a 
general state policy, beginning in 1817 and continuing until after 
the adoption of the present state constitution, in the direction of 
free schools in which education, and at their option the elements of 
classical education, might be brought within the reach of all the 
children of the State, then, as it seems to us, nothing can demon- 
strate it. We might follow the subject further and show that the 
subsequent legislation has all concurred with this policy, but it 
would be a waste of time and labor. We content ourselves with 
the statement that neither in our state policy, in our constitution, 
nor in our laws, do we find the primary school districts restricted 
in the branches of knowledge which their officers may cause to be 
taught, or the grade of instruction that may be given, if their 
voters consent in regular form to bear the expense and raise the 
taxes for the purpose. 
Having reached this conclusion, we shall spend no time upon 
the objection that the district in question had no authority to 
appoint a superintendent of schools, and that the duties of the 
superintendency should be performed by the district board. We 
think the power to make the appointment was incident to the full 
control which by law the board had over the schools of the district, 
and that the board and the people of the district have been wisely 
left by the legislature to follow their own judgment in the premises, 
In almost all the Upper Mississippi Valley States this 
decision has deeply influenced development. In more than 
one State a Supreme Court decision which established the 
high school has been clearly based on this Michigan decision.
-P-A-G-E-228
200 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
It ranks, therefore, along with the Massachusetts law of 
1827 as one of the important milestones in ‘the establish- 
ment of the American public high school. 4) 
Gradually the high school has been accepted as a part of 
the state common school system by all our States, and the 
funds and taxation originally provided for the common 
schools have been extended to cover the high school as well. 
The new States of the West have based their legislation on 
what the Eastern and Central States earlier fought out, 
though often the Western States have provided separate | 
and additional support for their high schools. California 
is perhaps our best example of such separate support. 
Wee 7. The state university crowns the system 
The earlier colleges — Harvard, William and Mary, Yale 
—had been created by the religious-state governments of 
the earlier colonial period, and continued to retain some 
state connections for a time after the coming of nationality, 
As it early became evident that a democracy demands intel- 
ligence on the part of its citizens, that the leaders of democ- 
racy are not likely to be too highly educated, and that the 
character of collegiate instruction must ultimately influence 
national development, efforts were accordingly made to 
change the old colleges or create new ones, the final outcome 
of which was the creation of state universities in all the new 
and in most of the older States. The evolution of the state 
university, as the crowning head of the free public school 
system of the State, represents the last phase which we 
shall trace of the struggle of democracy to create a system 
of schools suited to its peculiar needs. 
The colonial colleges. The close of the colonial period 
found the colonies possessed of nine colleges. These, with 
the dates of their foundation, the colony founding them, 
and the religious denomination they chiefly represented 
were:

1754. King’s College (Columbia) New York Anglican 
1764. Brown Rhode Island _ Baptist 
1766. Rutgers New Jersey Reformed.Dutch 
1769. Dartmouth New Hampshire Congregational 
The religious purpose had been dominant in the founding 
of each institution, though there was a gradual shading-off 
in strict denominational control and insistence upon religious 
conformity in the foundations after_1750. Still the prime 
purpose in the founding of each was to train up a learned 
and godly body of ministers, the earlier congregations, at 
least, “dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches 
when our present ministers shall lie in the dust.” _In a pam- 
phlet, published in 1754, President Clap of Yale declared 
that “Colleges are Societies of Ministers, for training up 
Persons for the Work of the Ministry,” and that “The great 
design of founding this School (Yale), was to Educate Min- 
isters in our own Way.” In the advertisement published 
in the New York papers announcing the opening of King’s 
College, in 1754, it was stated that: 
IV. The chief Thing that is aimed at in this College, is, to teach 
and engage the Children to know God in Jesus Christ, and to love 
and serve him in all Sobriety, Godliness, and Richness of Life, with a 
perfect Heart and a Willing Mind: and to train them up in all 
Virtuous Habits, and all such useful Knowledge as may render 
them creditable to their Families and Friends, Ornaments to their 
Country, and useful to the Public Weal in their generation. 
These colonial institutions were all small. For the first 
fifty years of Harvard’s history the attendance at the college 
seldom exceeded twenty, and the President did all the 
teaching. The first assistant teacher (tutor) was not ap- 
pointed until 1699, and the first professor not until 1721, 
when a professorship of divinity was endowed. By 1800 
the instruction was conducted by the President and three 
professors — divinity, mathematics, and “Oriental lan- 
guages” — assisted by a few tutors who received only class
-P-A-G-E-230
  202 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
fees, and the graduating classes seldom exceeded forty. The 
course was four years in length, and all students studied 
the same subjects. The first three years were given largely 
to the so-called “Oriental languages” — Hebrew, Greek, 
and Latin. In addition, Freshmen studied arithmetic; 
Sophomores, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry; and 
Juniors, natural (book) science; and all were given much 
training in oratory, and some general history was added. 
The Senior year was given mainly to ethics, philosophy, and 
Christian evidences. The instruction in the eight other 
older colleges, before 1800, was not materially different. 
National interest in higher education. One of Washing- 
ton’s most cherished ideas, and one warmly advocated by 
many leading citizens of the time, was that the new govern- 
ment should found a National University at the seat of the 
Federal Government, 
where the youth from all parts of the United States might receive 
the polish of erudition in the arts, sciences, and belles-lettres .. . 
and where, during . . . the juvenal period of life, when friendships 
are formed, and habits established, that stick by one, the youth 
. or young men from different parts of the United States would be 
assembled together, and would by degrees discover that there was 
not that cause for those jealousies and prejudices which one part 
of the "Jnion had imbibed against another part. 
Washington repeatedly called the matter to the attention 
of Congress, as did Presidents Adams, Madison, Monroe, 
and the second Adams; a square of land was at one time set 
aside at the National Capital for the new institution and 
was officially designated as University Square; and Wash- 
ington, in his will (1799), left a substantial sum to the 
Government of the United States, in trust, to start the 
endowment of the new university. For reasons hard to 
understand nothing ever came of the idea, and nothing is 
known to-day as to what became of the money which 
Washington left. 
Immediately after the close of the Revolutionary War 
settlers began to move to the new territory along the Ohio,
-P-A-G-E-231
BATTLE TO EXTEND THE SYSTEM 208 
and when the sale of 1,500,000 acres of land in south central 
Ohio was made by Congress, in 1787, to “The Ohio Com- 
pany,” a New England organization, the company was 
granted section 16 for schools, section 29 for religion, and, 
upon its request, two whole townships (72 sections, — 
46,080 acres) “for the purposes of a university.” In 1803 
the new State of Ohio was granted another township (36 
sections) “for the purposes of establishing an academy in the 
district of Cincinnati,” which district had also been settled 
by New England people. The former of these grants formed 
the original endowment of Ohio University, at Athens, and 
the latter the endowment of Miami University, at Oxford 
—the first state universities in the new West. The grant 
of two or more whole townships of land “for a seminary of 
learning,” or “state university,’ begun by Congress as a 
land-selling proposition in the case of Ohio, was continued 
with the admission of each new State afterward, and these 
township grants for a seminary of learning formed the begin- 
ning of the state universities which were created in all the 
new Western and Southern States. 
Growth of colleges by 1860. Fifteen additional colleges 
were founded before 1800, and it has been estimated that by 
that date the two dozen American colleges then existing did 
not have all told over one hundred professors and instruc 
tors, not less than one thousand nor more than two.thousan 
students, or property worth over one million dollars. Thei: 
graduating classes were small (p. 80). No one of the 
twenty-four admitted women in any way to its pri

in the United States before 1870 was provided very largely 
in the tuitional colleges of the different religious denomina- 
tions, rather than by the State. Of the 246 colleges founded 
by the close of the year 1860, as shown on the map, but 17 
were state institutions, and but two or three others had 
any state connections. 
The new national attitude toward the colleges. After 
the coming of nationality there gradually grew up a wide- 
spread dissatisfaction with the colleges as then conducted, 
because they were aristocratic in tendency, because they 
devoted themselves so exclusively to the needs of a class, 
and because they failed to answer the needs of the States 
in the matter of higher e education. Due to their religious 1870-79...

206 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
in New England and most in the South and the new States 
in the West, for institutions of higher learning which should 
represent the State. It was argued that colleges were im- 
portant instrumentalities for moulding the future, that the 
kind of education given in them must ultimately influence 
the welfare of the State, and that higher education cannot 
be regarded as a private matter. The type of education 
given in these higher institutions, it was argued, “will 
appear on the bench, at the bar, in the pulpit, and in the 
senate, and will unavoidably affect our civil and religious 
principles.” For these reasons, as well as to crown our state 
school system and to provide higher educational advantages 
for its leaders, it was argued that the State should exercise. 
  control over the colleges. 
This new national spirit manifested itself in a number 
of ways. In New York we see it in the reorganization 
of King’s College, the rechristening of the institution as 
Columbia, and the placing of it under at least the nominal 
supervision of the governing educational body of the State. 
In Pennsylvania an attempt was made to bring the univer- 
sity into closer connection with the State, but this failed. 
In New Hampshire the legislature tried, in 1816, to trans- 
form Dartmouth College into a state institution. This act 
was contested in the courts, and the case was finally carried 
to the Supreme Court of the United States. There it was 
decided, in 1819, that the charter of a college was & contract, 
the obligation of which a legislature could not impair. 
Effect of the Dartmouth College decision. The effect of 
this decision manifested itself in two different ways. On 
the one hand it guaranteed the perpetuity of endowments, 
and the great period of private Sr aainmina tons effort 
(see table, p. 204) now followed. On the other hand, since 
the States could not change charters and transform old 
establishments, they began to turn to the creation of new 
state universities of their own. Virginia created its state 
university the same year as the Dartmouth case decision. 
The University of North Carolina, which had been estab- 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
BATTLE TO EXTEND THE SYSTEM 207 
lished in 1789, and which began to give instruction in 1795, 
but which had never been under direct state control, was 
taken over by the State in 1821. The University of Ver- 
mont, originally chartered in 1791, was rechartered as a 
state university in 1838. The University of Indiana was 
established in 1820. Alabama provided for a state univer- 
sity in its first constitution, in 1819, and the institution 
opened for instruction in 1831. Michigan, in framing its 
first constitution preparatory to entering the Union, in 
1835, made careful provisions for the safeguarding of the 
state university and for establishing it as an integral part 
of its state school system, as Indiana had done in 1816. 
Wisconsin provided for the creation of a state university in 
1836, and embodied the idea in its first’ constitution when 
it entered the Union in 1848, and Missouri provided for a 
state university in 1839, Mississippi in 1844, Iowa in 1847, 
and Florida in 1856. The state university is to-day found 
in every “new” State and in some of the “original” States, 
and practically every new Western and Southern State fol- 
lowed the patterns set by Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin 
and made careful provision for the establishment and main- 
tenance of a state university in its first state constitution. 
There was thus quietly added another new section to the 
American educational ladder, and the free public school 
system was extended farther upward. Though the great 
period of state university foundation came after 1860, and 
the great period of state university expansion after 1885, 
the beginnings were clearly marked early in our national 
history. Of the sixteen States having state universities by 
1860 (see Fig. 36), all except Florida had established them 
before 1850. For a long time small, poorly supported by 
the States, much like the church colleges about them in 
character and often inferior in quality, one by one the state 
universities have freed themselves alike from denomina- 
tional restrictions on the one hand and political control on 
_ the other, and have set about rendering the service to the 
State which a state university ought to render. Michigan,
-P-A-G-E-236
208 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
the first of our state universities to free itself, take its proper 
place, and set an example for others to follow, opened in 
1841 with two professors and six students. In 1844 it was 
a little institution of three professors, one tutor, one assist- 
ant, and one visiting lecturer, had but fifty-three students, 
and offered but a single course of study, consisting chiefly 
of Greek, Latin, mathematics, and intellectual and moral 
science. As late as 1852 it had but seventy-two students, 
but by 1860, when it had largely freed itself from the incubus 
of Baptist Latin, Congregational Greek, Methodist intel- 
lectual philosophy, Presbyterian astronomy, and Whig 
mathematics, and its remarkable growth as a state univer- 
sity had begun, it enrolled five hundred and nineteen. 
The rise of professional instruction. The colonial col-— 
leges, as has been pointed out, were largely trainin; 
for the_ministry, and this long continued to be their one 
professi urp 
     purpose. It was largely because of this that so 
many of the early leaders in education — Stowe, Pierce, 
Hall, and Bateman, — among others — were men who had 
been trained for the ministry. It was not until 1812 that 
theology was separated off in a school by itself at Princeton, 
1819 at Harvard, and 1822 at Yale. 
The first professional instruction to be added by the early 
universities was medicine, a medical school being established 
at Pennsylvania as early as 1765, King’s in 1767, Harvard 
in 1782, Dartmouth in 1798, the University of Maryland 
department of medicine and the College of Physicians and 
Surgeons at New York both being established in 1807, and 
at Yale in 1813. Out of the instruction in medicine came 
first professors of this subject being at William and Mary in 
1774, Princeton in 1795, Columbia in 1802, and Yale in 1808. 
The first law school in the United States was a private one 
conducted by a judge in his office, at Litchfield, Connecticut, 
from 1784 to 1833, and to this many students went. for 
practical training. The first permanent instruction in law 
by a university came with the establishment of the law
-P-A-G-E-237
BATTLE TO EXTEND THE SYSTEM 209 
faculty of the University of Maryland, in 1812, and the 
opening of a law school at Harvard in 1817, Yale in 1824, 
and the University of Virginia in 1826. The medical and 
law schools of colonial times were the offices of practicing 
physicians and lawyers. Of the 3000 physicians in practice 
in the United States at the close of the Revolution, but 51 
had taken degrees in America, and less than 350 anywhere 
else. There were no lawyers holding degrees. The first 
technical school, the Rensselaer Polytechnic, was founded 
in 1824. The first college of dentistry was opened in Balti- 
more in 1839, and the second at Cincinnati in 1845. The 
first college of pharmacy was opened at Philadelphia in 1822. 
These subjects, now so common in our state universities, 
are all of relatively recent development. ‘ 
College education for women. Another change in 
nature of instruction, thoroughly indicative ‘of the dem 
racy of the West, was the opening of collegiate and profe: 
sional instruction to women. In 1800 women could n 
enter any college in the United States. In 1821 Emm 
Willard had opened a seminary for girls at Troy, New Yor 
and in 1837 Mt. Holyoke Seminary (later college) w: 
opened by Mary Lyon in Massachusetts. These mark thi 
beginnings of higher educationor girls. By 1840 there-wer¢ 
but seven institutions of all kinds for the higher educatio; 
of women, but by 1860 the number had increased to sixpy- 
one. Perhaps half of these later developed into colleges for 
women. After the Civil War, during which so many women 
filled places formerly held by men, and especially in teach- 
ing, the colleges began to open their doors somewhat gen- 
erally to women students. To-day eighty per cent of the 
non-Catholic colleges are open to women, while many special 
colleges for them also exist. 
Mt. Holyoke Seminary in Massachusetts (1837), Rock- 
ford Seminary in Illinois (1849), and Elmira College (1855) 
and Vassar College (1865), both in New York, were among 
the earliest of the larger women’s colleges, while Oberlin 
College (1833) and Antioch College (1853), both in Ohio,     
   
   
-P-A-G-E-238
  210 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
and the state university of Iowa (1856), were among the 
first institutions to open their instruction equally to men 
and women. Cisvery State west of the Mississippi River, 
except Missouri, made its state universityco-educational 
from its first opening, and of those east of the same river all 
but three have since followed the lead of Indiana (1868) and 
Michigan and Illinois (1870) in opening their doors freely 
to women students. The democratic spirit of the people 
west of the Allegheny Mountains has demanded, as the 
price of support, equal advantages for both theii 
female children. 
The new land-grant colleges. In 1850 Michigan peti- 
tioned Congress for a grant of public land to found a college 
of agriculture, and in 1858 renewed its petition. In 1859 a 
bill passed Congress making a grant of 20,000 acres of public 
land to each State, for each Senator and | Representative the 
State had in Congress, to endow a college of agriculture and 
mechanic arts. This was the Fellenberg manual-labor- 
seminary idea in a new form, with the manual-labor-support 
of students omitted. President Buchanan vetoed the bill 
because, among other reasons: 
  5. This bill will seriously interfere with existing colleges in the 
different States, in many of which agriculture is taught as a science 
and in all of which it ought to be so taught. These institutions of 
learning have grown up with the growth of the country, under the 
fostering care of the States and the munificence of individuals, to 
meet the advancing demands for education. They have proved 
great blessings to the people. Many, indeed most, are poor, and 
sustain themselves with difficulty. What the effect would be on 
these institutions by creating an indefinite number of rival colleges 
sustained by the endowment of the Federal Government it is not 
difficult to determine. 
In 1862 a similar bill, except that the grant was increased 
from 20,000 to 30,000 acres for each Senator and Repre- 
sentative, and that military science and tactics was added 
as a third required study, was passed by Congress and 
signed by President Lincoln. - A total of 11,367,832 acres of
-P-A-G-E-239
BATTLE TO EXTEND THE SYSTEM 211 
public land was given to the States to endow institutions 
for the teaching of the new subjects — an area one half as 
large as the State of Indiana — and fifty-one States and Ter- 
ritories, counting Porto Rico, Alaska, and Hawaii, now re- 
ceive money grants from the National Government to help 
carry on this work. Eighteen States added the land-grant 
to the endowment of their existing state universities and 
combined the two institutions, three of the original States 
(originally five) gave the grant to private institutions already 
established within the State, and the remainder. established 
separate agricultural and mechanical colleges. 
The financial returns from the land-grants were disap- 
pointing, but the educational returns have been very large. 
Probably no aid for education given by the National Gov- 
ernment to the States has proyed so fruitful as have these 
grants of land, and subsequently of money, for instruction 
in agriculture and the mechanic arts. New and vigorous 
colleges have been created (Cornell, Purdue, and the state 
universities of Ohio and Illinois are examples); small and 
feeble state universities have been awakened into new life 
(Vermont and Wisconsin are examples); agriculture and 
engineering have been developed as new learned professions; 
and the States have been stimulated to make larger and 
rapidly-increasing appropriations for their universities, until 
to-day the state universities largely overshadow all but the 
best endowed of the old denominational colleges. The far- 
reaching educational importance of the Morrill Act of 1862, 
so named for the Senator who framed and sponsored it, is 
not likely to be overestimated. 
The American free public school system now established. 
By the close of the second quarter of the nineteenth century, 
certainly by 1860, we find the American public school system 
fully established, in principle at least, in all our Northern 
States. Much yet remained to be done to carry into full 
effect what had been established in principle, but every- 
where democracy had won its fight, and the American public 
school, supported by genera] taxation, freed from the pauper-

school taint, free and equally open to all, under the direc- 
tion of representatives of the people, free from sectarian 
control, and complete from the primary school through the 
high school, and in the Western States through the univer- 
sity as well, may be considered as established permanently 
in American public policy. The establishment of the free 
public high school and the state university represent the 
crowning achievements of those who struggled to found 
a state-supported educational system fitted to the needs 
| of great democratic States. Probably no other influences 
have done more to unify the American people, reconcile 
diverse points of view, eliminate state jealousies, set ideals 
for our people, and train leaders for the service of the 
States and of the Nation than the academies, high schools, 
and colleges scattered over our land. They have educated 
but a small percentage of our people, to be sure, but they 
have trained most of the leaders who have ait oe 
democracy since its birth. _o

oo CHAPTER VIII 
CHARACTER OF THE SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED 
SLowLy, as we have seen, and after a series of conflicts, 
we gradually evolved a series of purely native American 
school systems to replace our earlier English inheritance. 
These extended from the primary school through the 
American-created English grammar school and English high 
school. In a few Southern and Western States — notably 
Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Indiana, and Michigan — 
an embryo state university was early added at the top. In 
this chapter we shall examine briefly the character of the 
early schools thus established, and shall seek to determine 
about what development had taken place in our city and 
state school systems before the outbreak of the Civil War 
for a time materially checked our educational progress. 
I. Evotution or THE GraDED ELEMENTARY ScHOOL 
The American school of the 3-Rs. Toward the close of 
Chapter II we traced the rise of a distinctively American 
consciousness after 1750, and the beginnings of the evolu- 
tion of distinctively American-type schools. This move- 
ment was checked by the War for Independence, but after 
about 1820 came out again in full force. Even before that 
time we have many clear indications of the lines along which 
development was eventually to take place. As schools be 
fore that time existed in their best form in New England, 
and as New England people carried the public school idea 
with them wherever they went, we naturally turn first to 
New England to see what types of schools were established 
there after the coming of nationality. 
From the first the teaching of reading and writing had 
been a common requirement in all the New England colo- 
nies, excepting Rhode Island, and some arithmetic, though
-P-A-G-E-244
gga a aa aa 
216 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
often quite small in amount, also was gradually added. The 
necessities of the rural districts, where separate teachers for 
writing and ciphering were not possible, forced a combina- 
tion of the teaching of these three subjects, thus forming the 
American school of the 3-Rs. The dame school covered 
the needs of the A-B-C-darians, and inducted the youngsters 
into the mysteries connected with the beginnings of learning 
to read, while the regular winter school conducted by men 
teachers, and the summer school by women teachers, con- 
tinued the instruction in 
these three subjects as 
long as the boys and 
girls were able to profit 
by it. With the short 
winter term, the slow 
individual method of in- 
struction, and the fa- 
mous books by Dilworth 
in English and Arithme- 
Fic. 37. A Summer Scuoon tic to fall back upon, the

long drawn out that 
these three subjects, with the spelling of words, filled up all 
the time that could be devoted to learning by most children. 
These arts, too, were sufficient for almost all the ordinary 
needs of life, as their possession, in the early period of our 
national history, served to distinguish the educated man or 
woman from the uneducated. 
New textbooks change the character of the old instruc- 
tion. Almost immediately after the close of the Revolu- 
tionary War a long series of native American schoolbooks 
began to appear. These not only replaced those of English 
origin previously used, but also materially expanded the 
course of instruction by reducing new subjects of study to 
textbook form.

reader, marked an epoch in the teaching of spelling and 
reading. , It was after the plan of Dilworth, but was thor- 
oughly American in character and put up in better teaching 
form. It at once superseded the expiring New England 
Primer in most of the cities. Spelling and word analysis 
now becameand long con-

most popular subjects in 
the schools, and inter-

old and the young. So

Columbian Orator (1806). The Preceptor 
was a graded reader and soon replaced the 
Bible as an advanced reading book, while 
the Orator was one of the earliest of a long 
list of books containing selections from 
poetry and prose for reading and declama- 
tion. These books suited well the new 
democratic spirit of the times, and became 
very popular. Selections from English poetry 
and the patriotic orations of Revolutionary 
leaders predominated. Many were illus-

THE AUDIENCE of John Adams, Hancock, and in particular

the schoolhouses all over the land. 
The English Dilworth’s The Schoolmaster’s Assistant, 
“being a compendium of Arithmetic, both practical and 
theoretical, in five parts,” which went through many 
American editions before 1800, did much to popularize the 
study of arithmetic. In 1788 Nicholas Pike’s Arithmetic, 
the first American text, appeared. It was a voluminous 
work of five hundred and twelve pages. It was soon “ufed 
as a claffical book in all the Newengland Univerfities,” but 
was too advanced for the schools. A number of briefer 
American arithmetics soon appeared and, in 1821, with the 
publication of Warren Colburn’s First Lessons in Arith- 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
  CHARACTER OF THE SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED 219 
metic on the Plan of Pestalozzi, another famous American 
textbook, one that must be ranked with Webster’s Speller, 
appeared. Arithmetic, and especially mental arithmetic, now 
became one of the great subjects of the common schools. 
These early books, together with a long list of imitators, 
firmly fixed reading, spelling, declamation, and arithmetic 
as the fundamental subjects for the evolving American 
common school. 
New subjects of study appear. New subjects of study 
also began to appear. The English Dilworth’s A New 
Guide to the English Tongue had made the beginnings of the 
teaching of English word usage, and in 1795 the first of a 
large number of editions of Lindley Murray’s Grammar 
made its appearance. This was soon followed by an almost 
equally popular text by Caleb Bingham, known as The 
Young Lady’s Accidence (1799). The title page of this 
book declared it to be ‘‘a fhort and eafy Introduction to 
English Grammar. Defigned principally for the ufe of young 
Learners, more efpecially thofe of the FAIR SEX, though 
proper for either.”” These two books became very popular, 
were extensively used and imitated, and firmly fixed the new 
study of English Grammar as a common-school subject. 
The publication of the Reverend Jedediah Morse’s Geog- 
raphy, in 1784, and his Elements of Geography, in 1795, 
added another subject which also became very popular. In 
1821 the first little booklet on United States history ap- 
peared, though some historical material had been included 
in the earlier readers under the subject of Geography. In 
1822 Goodrich’s A History of the United States was pub- 
lished, and this at once leaped into popular favor. One 
hundred and fifty thousand copies had been sold by 1882, 
when Noah Webster’s History of the United States appeared 
to contest its popularity. Both these histories long con- 
tinued popular as school texts, and the introduction of a 
study of the Constitution of the United States by Webster 
into his book marked the beginning of the study of Civics 
in our grammar schools.
-P-A-G-E-248
220 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
The elementary-school subjects fixed. The publication 
of these new texts opened up entirely new possibilities of 
instruction in the evolving American common school. The 
teaching of the old subjects was greatly enriched and ex- 
panded, while the new subjects made possible more advanced 
instruction and the upward extension and lengthening of 
the common-school course. John Howland, founder of the 
Providence schools, writing to a friend in 1824, said that 
the instruction in Providence remained as prescribed in 
1800 (p. 223), except that grammar and geography were 
soon introduced. Of these new subjects he said: 
Up to this time I had never seen a grammar — a sorry confes- 
sion for a school committeeman, some may think — but observing 
that The Young Lady’s Accidence was in use in the Boston schools, 
T sent to the principal bookseller in that town, and purchased one 
hundred copies for the use of ours. 
The introduction of grammar was quite an advance in the system 
of education, as it was not taught at all except in the better class 
of private schools. The same was true of geography, which had 
never been taught before. I sent to Boston and purchased as 
many as were wanted for our schools. Dr. Morse, of Charlestown, 
had published the first volume of his geography, and that was the 
work we adopted. Many thought it an unnecessary study, and 
some in private objected to it because it would take off their atten- 
tion from arithmetic. But it met with no public opposition. 
A race now began between arithmetic and the new subject 
of English grammar — a race unhappily too long continued 
— to see which subject should take the place of first impor- 
tance in the school. Fact-geography and fact-history also 
became important older-pupil subjects. Sewing and knit- 
ting also became common subjects of instruction for the 
girls, and, as the culmination of such instruction,.each girl 
made a “Sampler,” of which the copy opposite is a good 
example. These were made on linen, though in the girls’ 
“boarding-schools” elaborate work on silk was sometimes 
executed. The name ‘‘Sampler” came from the expected 
future use in showing the proper form of letters to be used

By 1830, certainly, we have the full curriculum of our 
elementary schools, as it was by 1860, clearly in use in our 
better city systems. The subjects were these:

Legal aspect of this course of instruction. Many of the 
early school laws enacted by the different States provided 
for instruction in these subjects. Massachusetts, for exam- 
ple, which had required instruction in reading and writing 
in the law of 1647, added orthography, good behavior, the 
English language and grammar, and arithmetic to the re-~

quired list in 1789, geography in 1826, and history of the 
United States in 1857. Vermont specified reading, writing, 
and arithmetic as required subjects in its law of 1797, and 
added spelling, geography, grammar, United States history, 
and good behavior in 1827. New England people, moving 
westward into the North-West Territory, carried these 
school requirements and the early textbooks with them, and 
the early schools set up in Ohio and Michigan were copies 
of those in the old home. Ohio, in its first school law of 1825, 
specified reading, writing, and arithmetic for all schools, and 
in 1831 permitted the cities and towns to organize instruction 
in other subjects. In 1848 geography and grammar were or- 
dered added for all schools. Michigan, in the law of 1827, 
virtually adopted the Massachusetts plan for schools. 
The Lancastrian schools, which were so prominent be- 
tween about 1810 and 1830 in the cities and towns of the 
Middle Atlantic States, and to a degree spread to all parts 
of the then Nation, were organized to give instruction in: 
Spelling English Grammar 
Reading Geography 
Writing Religion 
Arithmetic 
Early city courses of study. The early courses of study 
adopted for the cities of the time reveal the same studies in 
the schools, as well as the beginnings of the classification 
of the pupils on the basis of the difficulty of the subjects. 
For example, the course of study and the textbooks adopted 
for the schools of Providence, Rhode Island, in 1800, reads: 
The principal part of the Instruction will consistin Spelling, 
Accenting & Reading both Prose and Verse with propriety and 
accuracy, and a General Knowledge of English Grammar and 
Composition: Also writing a good hand according to the most ap- 
proved Rules, and Arithmetic through all the previous Rules, and 
Vulgar and Decimal Fractions, including Tare and Tret, Fellow- 
ship, Exchange, Interest, &c. 
The books to be used in carrying on the above Instruction are

other Books as shall hereafter be adopted and appointed by the 
Committee. The Book for teaching Arithmetic shall be agreed 
on by the Masters. 
The Scholars shall be put into separate Classes, according to 
their several improvements, each Sex by themselves. 
This constituted the entire printed course of study for 
Providence in that day, and was typical of the time. Com- 
pared with the hundreds of printed pages of directions which 
we have to-day, the simplicity of such a course of study is 
evident. Though ungraded in character, the beginnings of 
a grading of schools is nevertheless evident. This was the 
so-called “common school.” It presupposed that the chil- 
dren should have learned their letters and the beginnings 
of reading privately, or in some Dame School, before enter- 
ing the public school. This requirement was common be- 
fore the coming of Infant or Primary schools, about 1825. 
In New York City the schools of the Free School Society 
were at first organized to cover only the work of the 3-Rs 
and religion. An abstract of “the employment and pro- 
gressive improvement of the scholars for the last year,” 
contained in the Fourteenth Annual Report of the Society, 
for 1819, shows that of the 1051 children then in the schools, 
1044 were “known to attend public worship on the Sab- 
bath,” as required by the rules, and that the studies pur- 
sued by them were as follows: 
297 Children have been taught to form letters in sand. 
615 have been advanced from letters in sand, to monosyllabic 
reading on boards. 
686 from reading on boards, to Murray’s First Book. 
335 from Murray’s First Book, to writing on slates. 
218 from writing on slates, to writing on paper. 
341 to reading in the Bible 
277 to addition and subtraction. 
153 to multiplication and division. 
60 to the compounds of the four first rules. 
20 to reduction. 
24 to the rule of three. 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
  CHARACTER OF THE SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED 225 
This shows the common American ungraded 3-Rs school, 
taking children from the very beginnings, and advancing 
them individually and by subjects, as their progress war- 
ranted. Such schools were very common in the early period. 
On August 2, 1822, a committee of the New York Society 
was appointed to consider and report “on the propriety of 
instructing some of the oldest, most orderly, and meritori- 
ous of our scholars in some of the higher branches of an 
English Education, say Grammar, Geography, History, 
Mathematics, &c.” This was done soon thereafter by 
changing the schools for a time to a pay basis, as described 
on page 147, and the price list there given shows that the 
subjects taught at that time were: 
Alphabet Grammar Bookkeeping 
Spelling Geography Mensuration 
Writing History Astronomy 
Reading Composition 
Arithmetic Needlework 
Boston offers another illustration, out of many that 
might be cited. In 1789 the Town Meeting ordered three 
writing schools and three reading schools established in the 
town, for the instruction of children between the ages of 
seven and fourteen, who had previously learned to read, 
boys to be admitted all the year round, and girls only from 
April 20 to October 20 each year. The subjects to be taught 
in these schools were: 
The writing school The reading school 
Writing Spelling 
Arithmetic Accentuation 
Reading of prose and verse 
English Grammar and Composition 
By 1823 the study of geography had been added to the 
instruction in the reading schools, and a little later United 
States history also was added. Each school building con- 
tained two rooms, and was divided between the two depart- 
ments. ‘The upper room was occupied by the reading 
school, and the lower by the writing school. The pupils
-P-A-G-E-254

were interchanged, thus attending two schools and two 
teachers each day. Children were admitted to these schools 
from the Primary Schools for beginners, first established 
(p. 97) in 1818. 
The beginnings of school grading. In addition to the 
division of the schools horizontally into Primary Schools 
and English Grammar Schools, and the subdivision of the 
latter vertically into writing and reading schools, a begin- 
ning of classification and the grading of pupils had been 
made, by 1823, by the further subdivision of the reading 
school into four classes, as follows: 
Lowest class: Reading, spelling, accentuation; 
Second class: Same, and grammar memorized. 
Third class: Same, and grammar learned. 
Highest class: Same, and geography. 
This made four classes for the-seven-year course, with a

This creation of schools of different grades took place 
largely as new buildings were needed and erected. With 
each additional building in the same district the children 
were put into better classified schools. This same division 
of schools for purposes of grading, as new building facilities 
were provided, took place generally over the United States, 
between 1820 and 1850, though with quite different results 
and nomenclature, as the following twenty-five selected 
cities will show. The numbers in parentheses indicate the

' _The division of each school into classes. The first step 
in the evolution of the present class-grade organization of 
our schools was the division of the school system into 
schools of two or more different grades, such as Primary, 
Intermediate, Grammar, etc. The above table shows the 
results of such division for twenty-five of the larger cities 
of the time. This began early, and was accomplished gen- 
erally in our cities by 1840 to 1845. 
The next step in the evolution of the graded system was 
the division of each school into classes. This also began 
early, certainly by 1810, and was fully accomplished in the 
cities by 1840. It began by the employment of assistant 
teachers, known as “ushers,” to help the “master,” and 
the provision of small recitation rooms, off the main large 
room, for their use in hearing recitations. This step in the 
evolution of the graded system is well shown in the drawing 
of a Providence grammar-school building, given on p. 231, 
which is thoroughly typical of the period. Due to its later 
construction, however, the two schoolrooms in this building 
were smaller than was the case in earlier constructions. The 
New York school building of 1820, shown on page 87, was 
provided with 252 seats and three small recitation rooms. 
Boston buildings, in 1823, carried seats for approximately  
-P-A-G-E-258
  280 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
300 pupils, and each room had a master and two ushers, 
but by 1848 the number had there been reduced to approx- 
imately 180 seats. Each grammar school in Providence 
contained two separate and distinct and duplicate schools, 
as was a common early practice. Each school was under 
  Fig. 48. An “Usaer” anp His Chass

the control of a master and one male or two female assist- 
ants. Each little group of teachers in charge of a room 
was independent of the other, there being no principal for 
the building. Only for janitor service, heating, and repairs 
was the building considered as one school. 
The third and final step in the evolution of the graded 
system was to build schools with smaller classrooms, or to 
subdivide the larger rooms; change the separate and inde- 
pendent and duplicate school on each floor, which had been 
the common plan for so long, into parts of one school organi- 
zation; sort and grade the pupils, and outline the instruction 
by years; and the class system was at hand. This process  
-P-A-G-E-259

Scnoon 
This was the typical grammar-school building of about 1840. Each floor seated 228 pu- 
pils, and was conducted as a separate school. Boys and girls were here seated on opposite 
sides of the central aisle, though the usual plan was to give one floor to each sex. In Bos- 
ton the upper floor was used by the writing school, and the lower floor by the reading school. 
Two small recitation rooms are shown leading off the main room, for the use of the assistant 
teachers.
-P-A-G-E-260
232 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
began in the decade of the thirties, and was largely accom- 
plished in the cities by 1850. In the smaller places it came 
later, but usually was accomplished by or before 1870. In 
the rural districts class grading was not introduced until the 
last quarter of the nineteenth century. 
The transition to the graded system a natural evolution. 
The transition to the graded system came naturally and 
easily. For half a century the course of instruction in the 
evolving common or English grammar schools had been in 
the process of expansion, due in part to the preparation of 
better and longer textbooks, but largely through the addi- 
tion of new subjects of study. The school term had been 
gradually lengthened, the years of school provided had been 
increased in number, the school course had been differenti- 
ated into various parts or schools, the master and his assist- 
ants had from the first divided up the work in each room 
on a rough age-and-grade classification basis, and the entire 
evolution, up to about 1830 to 1840, had prepared the way 
for a simple reorganization of the work which would divide 
the schools into seven, or eight, or nine grades, and give 
each teacher one grade to handle. By the time of the 
beginnings of state and city school supervision the school 
systems of the cities only awaited the touch of the organizer 
to transform them from a series of differentiated schools 
into a series of graded schools that could be organized into a 
unified system, with a graded course of study, and unified 
supervision over all. The waste in maintaining two dupli- 
cate schools in the same building, each covering, the same 
two or three years of school work; when by re-sorting the 
pupils the work of each teacher could be made more special- 
ized and the pupils better taught, was certain to become 
obvious as soon as school supervision by teachers began to 
supersede school organization by laymen. 
As new buildings were erected with smaller classrooms, 
and as the large classrooms in old buildings were divided 
and the schools reorganized, the graded system, with a 
teacher in charge of each class, and a much smaller class at
-P-A-G-E-261
Fee ee oe ee eT TS ae ne ey te ee 
CHARACTER OF THE SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED 233 
that (55 to 75 were common sizes at first), came in as a 
perfectly natural evolution and as a matter of course. There 
was no change in subject-matter, as that had become fixed 
long before. There was no material lengthening of the 
course, as a combined course of seven to nine years had 
become common before grading had been fully carried out. 
There was also no change in method or purpose, except as 
the coming, about this time, of some Pestalozzian ideas, 
described in the next chapter, tended to improve all method, 
and except as the elimination of sectarianism and the estab- 
lishment of state-supported schools tended to give a clearer 
consciousness as to the citizenship-aim in instruction. Nor 
was there any general adoption of a new idea in organization 
from abroad. We merely evolved, as the result of some- 
thing like a half-century of gradual educational develop- 
ment, the common and purely native American elementary 
school which we have known for so long. As shown in the 
last tabulation given, this varied from seven to nine years 
in length, with eight and nine years as the common numbers. 
The primary classes, in part due to the pressure of numbers, 
gradually ceased to take pupils earlier than five, and later 
earlier than six, outside of New England, and the present 
eight-year elementary school (nine in New England), with 
a teacher for each grade, was evolved. On top of this the | 
English high school, also a purely native American creation, 
was superimposed, making a twelve or thirteen year course 
of public school instruction, which was tax-supported, state 
controlled, freed from sectarianism and the pauper taint, 
and equally open to all the children of the State. This evo- 
lution is shown somewhat roughly in Figure 23 (p. 99), 
and was fully accomplished by 1860 in all Northern States. 
The high school fitted onto the graded system. In the 
process of this evolution the high school also was made 
thoroughly democratic. When the English high schools 
were first established they were everywhere built on top of 
the common or grammar-school course, the evolution of 
which we have just described. The Latin grammar schools,
-P-A-G-E-262
ee ae 
234 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
though, as shown in the case of Boston (Fig. 42), as well as 
the Classical Course in a few cities having both courses in 
one school, took pupils at an earlier age. In general this 
was confined to New England, though San Francisco, as 
late as the sixties, admitted pupils to its Latin high school 
at ten, and to its English high school at twelve. By 1860 
this differentiation had been almost entirely abandoned as 
undemocratic and undesirable, and high-school courses had 
been based on the completion of the common-school course 
of study. This eliminated the last vestiges of the European 
class educational system with which we began, and put in 
its place the democratic educational ladder which has for so 
long characterized education in the United States. 
yy 1860 the English high school, now beginning to de- 
op in all the States, had clearly begun to take over the 
work in English, modern languages, history, mathematics,

The colleges thus fitted their work onto that of the re- 
cently evolved English high school, and the American edu- 
cational ladder was now 
complete. With the abo- 
lition of the rate-bill, which 
by 1860 had been done 
everywhere by the cities, 
and which still existed in 
the rural and town schools 
in but five of the then 
thirty-three States, this 
educational ladder was 
finally open to all Ameri- 
ean children as their edu- 
cational birthright. The 
two requisites for the climb 
were money enough to ob- 
tain freedom from work in 
order to attend, and brains 
and perseverance enough 
to retain a place in the 
classes. 
II. Taz Great Day or

The second and third 
quarters of the nineteenth 
century marked the great 
day of the district system. 
By 1830 to 1835 it was 
everywhere in control, but 
after 1860 to 1865 its seri- 
ous defects as a system of 
school administration had 
become evident in the

cities, and were beginning to be apparent even in rural dis- 
tricts. Everywhere, by the latter dates, there was a ten-

dency to limit the district powers, and later to abolish the 
system. 
The cities were the first to curb and subordinate the dis- 
trict and perfect a unified school system, and we shall 
accordingly consider city school organization first. 
The district system in the cities. In many of our cities, 
especially to the westward, no such unified system of school 
administration as that described for Providence existed. 
Instead, the district system of school administration was 
introduced into the different wards of the city. As the 
people in each ward felt willing to provide school facilities for 
their children they were permitted by law to call a meeting, 
organize a school district in the ward, vote to erect a school 
building, employ teachers, and vote to tax themselves to 
maintain the school. Some wards thus had public schools 
and others did not, but each ward so organizing was allowed 
to elect its own board of school trustees and to control and 
supervise its school. In many of our older cities outside 
of New England, particularly those which at first were set- 
tled by New England people, the first schools began under 
the same form of organization as the regular rural district 
schools. It was the one way to secure action in the pro- 
gressive wards of unprogressive cities. 
The different cities thus came to contain a number of 
what were virtually country school districts, each maintain- 
ing an ungraded and independent district school. As the 
city grew, these ungraded and independent schools increased 
innumber and size. Later the situation became impossible, 
the city was unified by law for education as it had previously 
been for city government, a city board of education was 
created and given control of the scattered schools, and this 
board employed a new supervisory officer, now becoming 
known as a city superintendent of schools, to unify and 
supervise the schools. The early educational history of a 
number of our cities is the history of the formation of a 
number of such independent district schools in the different 
wards of the city, and their later unification into one city
-P-A-G-E-265
CHARACTER OF THE SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED 237 
school system. It is from this that the old term “ward 
schools”’ has come down to us, as well as ward representation 
on the city school board and too frequently ward politics 
in the management of the schools as well. 
Examples of city-district consolidations. The cities of 
Buffalo, Detroit, and Chicago illustrate this process very 
well. 
The first schoolhouse in Buffalo was built privately, in 
1806, and burned in 1813. In 1818 the first tax for a school 
in Buffalo was levied to rebuild this school. By 1832 six 
one-teacher school districts had been organized in the city, 
and by 1837 there were seven. The city by that time had 
something like 15,000 inhabitants. That year the first 
superintendent of city schools in the United States was 
appointed, to unify and supervise these seven schools. {On 
the full establishment of the free-school system, in 1889, 
the number of dis- 
tricts was increased 
to fifteen, to supply 
deficiencies, and a 
school was ordered 
established in each, 
withacentral school 
for instruction in 
the higher English 
branches.

troit is another ex- Fic. 46. Ta First Fres Pusiic Scnoon in ample, of a some- Derrorr

trict system stood in the way of school organization, and 
had to be overthrown before any substantial progress could 
be made. Private and church schools had existed there 
since as early as 1816. The first public school, though, was 
not organized until the second ward took action, in 1838. 
Other wards not being willing to tax themselves for schools,     
   
      
-P-A-G-E-266
238 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
little further progress was made until 1841. In that year 
an investigation showed that there were 27 schools of all 
kinds in the city, instructing a total of 714 pupils, and 1850 
children of school age without any instruction whatever. 
Detroit was at that time a city of approximately 10,000 
inhabitants. The result was a campaign for public schools, 
and a petition to amend the city charter to permit the or- 
ganization of a city board of education to provide schools 
generally throughout the city. This was bitterly opposed, 
but the proposal carried at a city election and, in 1842, the 
legislature, following the best eastern practices of the time, 
abolished the district system in Detroit and provided for 
the organization of a unified system of schools for the city, 
under a city board of education. 
Chicago is a third illustration of much the same type as 
Buffalo. A private school was opened there as early as 
1816, but the first public school was not established until 
1832. The town was incorporated in 1833, and in 1835 a 
special law for Chicago established the Massachusetts dis- 
trict system in the city. By 1837 there were 5 schools and 
828 children, and by 1844 there were 8 teachers and 816 
children, the enrollments of the 8 teachers being 97, 75, 180, 
70, 131, 180, 110, and 75 children respectively. By 1853 
there were 7 district schools, employing 34 teachers, and 
enrolling 3086 children, or an average of 91 children to the 
teacher. The schools at that time still were ungraded, and 
practically independent in methods, textbooks, and plan. 
They were also very insufficient in numbers, as they had 
been provided only in parts of the city where the demand 
for schools was strong enough to insure the voting of taxes. 
Thousands of children were being turned away because of 
lack of school facilities. In 1853 the city council appointed 
a city superintendent of schools to unify the work done in 
the districts. He at once graded and reorganized the instruc- 
tion, and introduced uniform records and textbooks. In 
1857 the legislature abolished the district system in the city, 
and created a city board of education to take charge of the
-P-A-G-E-267
CHARACTER OF THE SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED 239 
schools. This established one city school system for the 
city. In 1861 the first graded course of study in Illinois 
was provided for the schools of Chicago. 
Many other cities have had a similar educational admin- 
istrative history, but practically everywhere the district 
system was early abolished, and to its early abolition and 
to the early unification of the school system the great educa- 
tional progress of the cities during the past half-century is 
largely due. 
Rural district management. As was stated at the begin- 
ning of Chapter VI, the district system was the natural sys- 
tem in the early days of state school organization and con-

trol. At a time when population was sparse, intercourse 
limited, communication difficult, supervision practically 
absent, and isolation the rule, the district system rendered 
its greatest service. It provided schools suited to the wants 
and needs of country people, and where and as fast as the 
people were willing to support them. The system was well 
adapted, too, to the earlier ideas as to the nature and pur- 
pose of education. Schools were then purely local affairs, 
and the imparting of a limited amount of information was 
almost their sole purpose. Knowledge then was power, and 
the schools were conducted on a knowledge basis, undis- 
turbed by any ideas as to psychological procedure, social
-P-A-G-E-268
  240 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
needs, or by the civic and economic problems of the 
present. 
Each community lived largely for its own ends, and was 
largely a law unto itself. Freedom and liberty were con- 
ceived of, as expressed by one of our poets, as: 
The right of every freeborn man ~ 
To do as he darned pleases. 
Naturally, under such conditions, every little community 
felt itself competent to select and examine its teachers, adopt 
its own course of study, determine the methods of instruc- 
tion, supervise and criticise the teacher, and determine all 
such matters as boarding-around arrangements, tax rate, 
and length of term. The three district trustees, with the 
people in district meeting, exercised very important func- 
tions in guiding the Ship of State, and to many a man in 
the districts the office of school trustee was the most im- 
portant office within the gift of the American people to 
which he might ever hope to aspire. 
Merits and defects of the district unit. One of the 
chief merits of the district system of school administration, 
and one for which it has been greatly extolled, was that the 
school district meeting served as a forensic center for the 
new democratic life of the time. The victory of Andrew 
Jackson was a victory for democracy which was felt even in 
remote rural districts. The school district has been and 
still is the smallest unit of local self-government in our 
political system, and the one small unit to which much power 
is still given. It corresponds to the parish in the manage- 
ment of church affairs, or to the early New England town 
meeting under the old régime. , As a unit of local govern- 
ment it once doubtless did much to educate the people in 
civic spirit and patriotism, and trained them in the simple 
forms of parliamentary procedure. There they learned to 
speak and to defend their rights — real or imaginary — as 
well as to present their grievances and pay off old scores. 
At a time when general education at public expense hung in
-P-A-G-E-269
>   
CHARACTER OF THE SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED 241 
the balance, the district system doubtless did much toward 
awakening a conception of the need for and the benefits of 
popular education. 
On the other hand, the system awakened an exaggerated ) 
idea as to district importance, an idea as to district perfec- 
tion which rendered it impervious to criticism, a deep jeal- 
ousy of larger and more prosperous districts, frequently a 
banding together to keep others from enjoying what the | 
poorer ones could not enjoy, and usually persistent and 
bitter opposition to any attempt at reform. es 
Even by 1850 the tendency in the States had become 
marked to limit the powers of the district meeting, and to 
take away powers from the trustees and transfer them to 
the county and state superintendents which were then being 
created, or to determine the matter once for all by consti- 
tutional requirement or uniform state law. In most States 
the district meeting was shorn of such powers as the right 
to designate the teacher, select the textbooks, or make out 
the course of study, and the trustees were early shorn of 
their power to examine and certificate the teacher they 
selected. The length of term, the rate of tax that must be 
levied, and the subjects that must be taught were early 
specified in the laws. In about this form the district system 
has continued to the present, though a number of States 
have abandoned it for a better system of school adminis- \ 
tration. The earliest States to do so were Indiana, in 1852; 
Massachusetts, in 1882; New Hampshire, in 1885; Georgia, 
in 1887; Florida, in 1889; Maine and Ohio, in 1892; Vermont 
and Rhode Island, in 1904; and New Jersey, in 1894. Since 
1900 a number of other States have taken similar action. 
TI. Genrrat CHARAcTeR OF THE Earty Scuoois 
Character of the early teachers. Our schools, like our 
_ clothing during this early period, were largely of the home- 
spun variety. Not only were the subjects of instruction 
those of the natively evolving American school, but our 
teachers and school officers were of the same native type.  
-P-A-G-E-270
  242 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
The professional teacher and school officer had not as yet 
appeared. The first American state normal school opened 
at Lexington, Massachusetts, in 1839, but as late as 1860 
there were but eleven such state schools in the entire United 
States, and these eleven were confined to eight Northern 
States. Teachers’ institutes, first definitely organized by 
Henry Barnard in Connecticut, in 1839, had been introduced

into but fifteen other States by 1860, and these all in the 
northeastern quarter of the United States. But few books 
of a professional nature, aside from the School Journals 
which began to appear in the twenties and thirties (p. 260) 
had as yet been published. Samuel R. Hall’s Lectures on 
Schoolkeeping, published in 1829, was the first professional 
book for teachers published in America, and David Page’s 
Theory and Practice of Teaching, first issued in 1847, was 
one of the earliest, as well as one of the most successful of 
all professional books. Our best teachers were graduates
-P-A-G-E-271
CHARACTER OF THE SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED 243 
of the academies and the rising high schools, and the masters 
in the larger cities of the East were nearly always well- 
educated men, but the great mass of the teachers had little 
education beyond that of the schools they themselves 
taught. Terms were short, wages low and paid in part 
through “boarding-around” arrangements, and _profes- 
sional standards, outside a few cities, were almost completely 
absent. In place of the written examination in many sub- 
jects or the professional training now quite generally de- 
manded for a teacher’s certificate, in the earlier period 
teachers were given a short personal examination “in regard 
to moral character, learning, and ability to teach school.” 
Not being satisfied with such requirements, the cities were 
early permitted to conduct separate examinations for the 
teachers they employed. It was customary in rural dis- 
tricts to hold both a summer and a winter term, and to con- 
tract separately for each. Women frequently taught in the 
summer, but the teachers in the winter were practically 
always men. 
The cities then, as since, drew the best of the teachers, 
both in training and character. In the rural districts the 
teachers were men who worked on the farms or at day labor 
in the summer, and frequently left much to be desired. Con- 
tracts and rules of the time not infrequently required that 
the teacher conduct himself properly and “refrain from all 
spirituous liquors while engaged in this school, and not to 
enter the school house when intoxicated, nor to lose time 
through such intemperance.” On the contrary, many 
schoolmasters of the time were excellent drill masters and 
kind of heart, and well merited George Arnold’s description: 
He taught his scholars the rule of three, 
Writing, and reading, and history too; 
He took the little ones up on his knee, 
For a kind old heart in his breast had he, 
And the wants of the littlest child he knew. 
The required studies were reading, writing, spelling, and 
arithmetic everywhere, with geography and grammar gen-  
-P-A-G-E-272
244 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
erally added by 1845. Composition, United States history, 
and simple bookkeeping were usually included for the town 
schools. These subjects the teacher obligated himself in 
his contract to teach “to all the youth of the district that 
may be placed under his care,”’ and they constituted the 
instruction of the school and were taught by methods quite 
different from those now in use. Oral instruction, the 
word method in teaching reading, language lessons, instruc- 
tions about realities, elementary science, geography built 
on the child’s environment instead of the pages of a book, 
arithmetic by analysis instead of sums by rule, music, draw- 
ing, reasoning instead of memorizing, and teaching that 
comes from the full mind of the teacher rather than from 
the pages of a book — with all of which we are now so fa- 
miliar — were hardly known in the forties in the best of our 
schools, or before 1860 outside of the more progressive cities. 
It was also made the duty of the teacher “to keep strict rules 
and good order,” and the ability to discipline the school was 
an important part of the teacher’s qualifications. There 
was little “soft pedagogy” in the management of either 
town or rural schools in the days before the Civil War. 
The schoolhouses and their equipment. Up to the time 
Henry Barnard began to write on schoolhouse construction 
(about 1840), no one had given any particular attention to 
the subject. Schoolhouses were “home-made,” and, out- 
side of the few large cities, were largely built without plans 
or specifications. For one of the early schoolhouses built 
in Providence, Rhode Island, the entire contract consisted 
of a very rough pen-and-ink sketch, on a single sheet of 
paper, showing windows, rafters, steeple, and length and 
breadth, and across this the contractor had written: 
For the confider one thoufan two hundred dollars erect & build 
finde the matearels & paintent the fame and lay the foundations 
build the chimney and compleated faid building fit for youse; 
and signed his name. Many schoolhouses in the towns and 
rural districts were built in a similar manner until well after 
  4

the close of the Civil War. In the rural districts “a weather- 
boarded box” or an old log schoolhouse, with two or three 
windows on each side, a few wooden benches, and an un- 
jacketed stove in the 2 
; middle of the room, Pos answered all needs. In Rese = 
the cities a very ornate eG & S

in after the building of 
high schools began, but 
few high-school build- 
y — ings erected before 1860 
contained any rooms 
beside class recitation 
rooms, an office, and an assembly hall (see Fig. 34, p. 195). 
The instruction was still almost entirely book instruction, 
and little else than recitation rooms were needed. The 
school furniture consisted of long home-made benches in ‘ 
the rural schools, and double desks in the cities. The

These represent the best types of city school furniture in general use at the time. 
Quincy School, built in Boston in 1848, introduced a new ~— 
type of school architecture in that the building contained a 
small classroom for each teacher — twelve in all, with seats 
for fifty-five pupils in each — an assembly room, a coat and
-P-A-G-E-274
    246 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
cloak room off each classroom, and “a separate desk and 
chair for each pupil, this being the first grammar school- 
house,” wrote the principal thirty years later, “here or 
elsewhere, so far as I know, into which this feature was 
introduced.” 
Blackboards were not in use until about 1820, and globes 
and maps were not common till later. The early geogra- 
phies contained almost no maps, and the early histories few 
illustrations. Steel pens did not replace the use of quills 
until near the middle of the nineteenth century. 
Purposes in instruction. The knowledge aim dominated 
all instruction. Knowledge was the important thing, as it 
was rather firmly believed that knowledge and virtue were 
somewhat synonymous terms. The fundamental subjects 
of the common-school course were drilled upon, and the 
trustees or the school committee, when they visited the 
school, examined the pupils as to their ability to read and 
spell, inspected the copybooks, and quizzed the pupils as to 
their knowledge of the rules of arithmetic and grammar, 
and the location of towns and rivers and capes. Competi- 
tive spelling and reading contests were common, to write 
a good and ornate hand was a matter of note, while the 
solving of arithmetical puzzles, parsing and diagramming of 
sentences, and locating geographical points were accom- 
plishments which marked the higher stages of a com- 
mon-school education. Arithmetic and English grammar 
became firmly fixed as the great subjects of the com- 
mon-school course of study, and the momentum these two 
subjects accumulated in the early days of public education 
is as yet far from spent.

Education in the Southern States. But little mention has 
so far been made of the school systems of the Southern 
States, for the reason that education there, as has already 
been stated, was much slower in getting under way than in 
the Northern States. In most of the Southern States, de-
-P-A-G-E-275

spite some promising beginnings, an educational system was 
not created until after the close of the Civil War. A brief 
digest of the important educational legislation enacted in 
the different States before the outbreak of the war will make 
this evident. 
1. The original States 
Delaware. State school fund created in 1796, but unused until 
1817; then $1000 a year given to each county to educate pauper 
children in reading, writing, and arithmetic. In 1821 aid extended 
to Sunday Schools. First permissive free school law in 1821, and 
schools of Wilmington begun. People unwilling to tax themselves, 
and by 1833 only 133 school districts organized in the State. In 
1843 an educational convention adopted a resolution opposing 
taxation for education, and little more was done until 1861, the 
date of the first law to really start the schools. 
Maryland. Many academies chartered, and lottery much used 
before 1817. School fund begun by a bank tax, in 1812, and first 
property tax authorized, in 1816, to provide charity schools. Lot- 
tery to raise $50,000 a year for five years for such schools, between 
1816 and 1821. First general school law in 1825, providing for 
State Superintendent and Lancastrian schools. Too advanced, 
never in operation, law repealed and superintendency abolished 
in 1827, and little more done. Virtually no school system outside 
of Baltimore by 1860. Real beginning of state school system 
dates from 1865. 
Virginia. Optional school law in 1796, but little done under it. 
Literary Fund created in 1810. Second school law in 1818, pro- 
vided for a charity school system, and $45,000 a year state aid for 
such. By 1843 estimated that one half the indigent children in 
the State were receiving sixty days schooling each year. Much 
educational agitation after 1837. Third school law in 1846, pro- 
viding for school districts, taxation, and county school commis- 
sioners. Good law, but optional, and as only nine counties adopted 
it, the charity school law of 1818 virtually continued. The Civil 
War ended the old system; real beginning of state school system 
dates from 1870. 
North Carolina. This State made a good beginning before the 
Civil War, and an excellent record during the war. State univer- 
sity opened in 1795. Many academies chartered, and lottery much
-P-A-G-E-276
  248 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
used to aid them. School law reported in 1817, but failed of pas- 
sage. Charit¥-school law reported in 1824, but also failed. Lan- 
_ castrian system proposed in 1882, and also failed. Elementary 
school system created in 1839, and state superintendency in 1852. 
Schools well under way after 1852. From 1853 to 1865 history of 
school system almost a biography of the Scotch-Irish Superin- 
tendent, Calvin H. Wiley. Temptation to use the $2,000,000 
school fund for war needs resisted, and schools kept open during 
the war. System abolished by reconstruction government in 1865. 
Present system dates from 1868. Wiley, in his last Report, well said: 
To the lasting credit of North Carolina, her public schools survived the 
terrible shock of the cruel war. ...The common schools lived and dis- 
charged their useful mission through all the gloom and trials of the conflict, 
and when the last gun was fired, and veteran armies once hostile were 
meeting and embracing in peace upon our soil, the doors were still kept 
open, and they numbered their pupils by scores of thousands. 
South Carolina. First law, in 1811, created virtually a charity 
school for Charleston. Report in 1836 recommended charity 
schools for the State, but no action. In 1854 Charleston asked to 
be permitted to provide free schools; granted in 1856. Between 
1790 and 1856 state constitution amended seven times, without 
including any mention of education. Present state school system 
dates from 1868. 
Georgia. The first state university chartered here in 1784, and 
- opened in 1800. In 1817 a fund created for free schools, and in 
1822 income designated for tuition of poor children. By 1820 
thirty-one academies chartered, and academy fund permitted to 
be used to aid charity schools. Free School Societies begun in 
Savannah in 1818, and Augusta in 1821, to provide charity schools. 
In 1837 the academy fund turned over to the common-school 
fund, and a good free-school system established, but in 1840 law 
repealed and charity-school system reéstablished. In 1858 word 
“poor” eliminated from school law, but. by 1860 only one county 
had established a free-school system. Present state school system 
dates from the Law of 1870. 
2. New States, in order of admission 
Kentucky. Admitted in 1792. No general interest in education 
before 1820. In 1821 first provision for aid to common schools and 
a fund created, but proved abortive, and legislature used the fund. 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
‘CHARACTER OF THE SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED 249 
In 1830 first general law for schools, but proved a dead letter, due 
to lack of interest in education. In 1837 real interest began, and 
law provided for district organization, State Board of Education, 
and State Superintendent of Schools. At that time estimated that 
one half of the children of the State had never been to school, and 
one third of the adult population illiterate. Louisville schools 
date from 1819, were made free during 1829-30, and permanently 
after 1840. In 1848 the debt of the State to the school fund was 
acknowledged (see p. 138), in 1849 the first state school tax was 
levied, and the new constitution of 1850 made the first mention of 
education. By 1853 a school existed in each county for the first 
time. The Civil War interrupted the old system; present state 
system dates from 1870. 
Tennessee. Admitted in 1796. In 1817 declared that “colleges 
and academies should form a complete system of education.” 
First general school law, in 1830, provided for districts, trustees, 
and county commissioners, but no tax for maintenance. It also 
provided that no distinctions be made between rich and poor in 
schools. State school fund safeguarded in new constitution of 
1834. In 1835 Secretary of State made ex-officio State Superin- 
tendent of Schools. Schools increased, but system lacked vigor _ 
before 1860. From 1860 to 1867 schools closed. Real beginnings 
of present state school system made by the Law of 1870. 
Louisiana. Admitted in 1812. A University of Louisiana cre- 
ated in 1805, and a system of free schools in 1806, after the French 
model, but not put into effect. No mention of education in con- 
stitution of 1812, and nothing done toward a state system of free 
schools until new constitution of 1845. Law of 1847 began sys- 
tem, provided for state superintendent, and taxation. By 1851 
estimated that one half the children of the State were attending 
public schools. The Civil War put an end to this system. Though 
the military government established schools in 1864, the present 
school system dates from 1877, when the withdrawal of Northern 
rule left the people free to inaugurate one of their own choice. 
Mississippi. Admitted in 1817. Schools permitted in 1818. 
Literary Fund created in 1821, to be used in each county for edu- 
cation of selected poor in reading, writing, and arithmetic. In 
1833 the fund was turned over to the counties, and the state system 
abandoned. Much agitation for schools from 1844, and new law 
of 1846 permitted schools, but no tax for without consent, each 
year, of majority of heads of families. This nullified the law.

Texas. The Mexican Government had organized Lancastrian 
tuition schools in the State in 1829. First constitution, in 1836, 
provided for state superintendent of schools. In 1840 each county

The problem faced by the South. It will be seen from 
the above digest that, although the “common-school awak- 
ening” which took place in the. Northern States after:
-P-A-G-E-279
CHARACTER OF THE SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED 261 
Horace Mann began his work in Massachusetts (1837) was 
felt in some of the Southern States as well, and although 
some very commendable beginnings had been made in a 
few of these States before 1860, the establishment of state 
educational systems in the South was in reality the work of 
the period following the close of the Civil War. The com- 
ing of this conflict, evident for a decade before the storm 
broke, tended to postpone further educational development. 
Following the close of the war the different Southern 
States started the work of building up state free public 
school systems with an energy which their depleted resources 
and lost school funds hardly warranted. This they did 
because they realized that the education of all classes of their 
people was the surest means for promoting the prosperity 
of the South. Robert E. Lee well expressed the best 
Southern feeling when he wrote, in 1866, to his friend 
Leyburn: 
So greatly have those interests [educational] been disturbed at 
the South, and so much does its future condition depend upon the 
rising generation, that I consider the proper education of its youth 
one of the most important objects now to be attained, and one 
from which the greatest benefits may be expected. Nothing will 
compensate us for the depression of the standard of our moral and 
intellectual culture, and each State should take the most energetic 
measures to revive the schools and colleges, and, if possible, to 
increase the facilities for instruction and to elevate the standard of 
learning. 
It was a tremendous undertaking, and called for much 
energy and pluck from a people whose property had been 
largely swept away and whose school funds had been largely 
lost. In addition, four millions of uneducated new citizens 
were added to the educational burden of the South as a 
result of the Civil War. The National Congress was re- 
peatedly appealed to (1881-89) for assistance, and although 
a bill intended to aid the South passed the Senate three 
times, it each time failed of passage in the House. As a 
result the aid which would have been so useful and which
-P-A-G-E-280
252 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
ought to have been extended was denied. In consequence 
it required nearly a quarter of a century for the Southern 
States to get their school systems satisfactorily under way, 
and to take their proper educational position among the 
States of the Nation. 
Development checked and changed in direction. The 
coming of the Civil War largely checked development at 
the North as well. The war itself absorbed the energies of 
our people, and it was a decade and a half after its close 
before any marked signs of expansion and development 
were evident, even in the North. The second quarter of 
the nineteenth century had been essentially a period of the 
establishment of the American free public school in the 
minds of the people and in the laws of the States. By 1850 
the main lines for future development had been laid down, 
and the main battles had been won. The American people 
had definitely decided that they intended to establish and 
maintain a series of state systems of free, publicly controlled, 
tax-supported, non-sectarian common schools, and that 
these common-school systems should provide whatever 
educational advantages the needs of the States might seem 
to demand. Many minor points still remained to be de- 
cided, and many local struggles still remained to be fought 
out, but the main lines of future development had been 
firmly established. 
After 1850 a number of additions to and extensions of the 
public-education idea began to be noted — evidences of a 
desire to extend the school systems and to make of them 
more useful instruments for state and national service. 
Evening schools, probably first begun in New York City, 
about 1833, began to be added by a number of cities to their 
school systems, and the first evening high school was opened 
in Cincinnati, in 1856. Music had been introduced into the 
schools of Boston in 1837, and Providence (see p. 227) before 
1848, and was beginning to find favor here and there. Draw- 
ing first became an optional public school subject in Massa- 
chusetts in 1858, and was first taught regularly in Boston

Taking into account all public and private schooling of

estimated that each individual in our population received, 
during his lifetime, at the dates given, an average of the 
number of days and months (of 20 school days each) of 
schooling shown in the adjoining table. We had also, by

most all material develop- 
ment at the North, and almost completely closed the schools 
in the South. Up to about 1880 at the North, and 1890 to 
1895 at the South, further development and expansion came 
but slowly; expenses were kept down, school buildings were 
kept simple and along established lines, few new features 
were added to the curriculum, and few new school super- 
visory officers were employed. Then came the wonderful 
development in public education which has characterized 
the past twenty-five to thirty years. 
In the meantime our educational system was being devel- 
oped in another way. Up to 1835 certainly, and in most 
places for from one to two decades longer, all development 
was a purely native development. After about 1835 to 
1840 we began to be touched by new influences from the 
outside, through new citizens and returning travelers who

described for us the work of Pestalozzi and his disciples in 
Switzerland and the Pestalozzian organization of instruction 
in Holland and the German States. After 1860 we began 
seriously to introduce among our teachers a new method of 
instruction, based on the psychological foundations worked 
out by Pestalozzi and his successors. The period from about 
1850 or 1860 to about 1880 or 1890 was the period of the in- 
troduction and organization of teaching method, when we 
made up in internal organization what we lacked in external 
development, and to this interesting addition to our educa-

QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION———— 
1. Explain why declamation should have been so natural a subject to 
add to the school of the 3-Rs. 
2. Show why English grammar, once introduced, would naturally be- 
come a popular subject of study. 
8. Explain how the publication of the new textbooks on the new subjects 
“opened up entirely new possibilities in instruction.” 
4. Show how the spirit with which the introduction of new subjects at 
Providence was met, as described by Howland, was quite modern in 
character. 
5. Was the Boston school system of 1823 a thoroughly democratic one, 
ornot? Why? 
6. Show how the absence of any professional supervision naturally 
tended to the independence of teachers and schools in the early period 
of our history. 
7. Why should the new high schools have been fitted on to the grammar- 
school course, instead of beginning as the Latin grammar schools did 
at an earlier period? 
8. What does the list of college entrance subjects given indicate as to 
the change in character of the colleges? 
9. Why was it a natural condition to find the district system in the cities 
during their early history? 
10. Show how city boards of education were a natural evolution out of 
city-council control of the early schools, and then how a city super- 
intendent of schools came as a further natural evolution. 
11. About what percentage of the school children of Buffalo could have 
been cared for in the seven public schools of 1837? 
12. Picture the results in Chicago or Detroit or Buffalo to-day if the

special city boards of examination for teachers’ credentials, instead 
of accepting the certificates issued by county or state authorities. 
14. Show how natural it was that the knowledge aim should have domi- 
nated instruction during the 1830 to 1860 period. 
15. Do you agree that the North should have aided the South in develop- 
ing its schools after the close of the Civil War? Why? 
16. Show how natural it was that the Civil War should have checked 
expansion and material development, and forced the schools to a de- 
velopment within.

CHAPTER IX 
NEW IDEAS FROM ABROAD 
I. Enetisn Orteins anD Earty INDEPENDENCE 
Early influences largely English. As will have been seen 
from a study of the earlier chapters, the chief source from 
which our early educational ideas came was England. 
Throughout all the colonial period, and well into our national 
period also, we were English in our history, traditions, and 
development. Though the Dutch and Swedish parochial 
schools were introduced into New Amsterdam, though many 
French Huguenots settled along the Carolina coast, and 
though the German parochial school was firmly. planted in 
Pennsylvania, these really influenced American development 
but little. The Dutch, Swedish, and French were rapidly 
absorbed and largely lost their identity after the English oc- 
cupation, while the Germans became isolated and influenced 
development but little outside of eastern Pennsylvania. 
The great source of all our early educational traditions, 
types of schools, textbooks, and educational attitudes was 
England, and education was established and conducted 
here much after the fashion of the practices in the mother 
country. In New England it was the English Puritan with 
his Calvinistic viewpoint, and to the southward it was the 
Anglican churchman interpreting the Englishman’s “‘ no-bus- 
iness-of-the-State ” attitude as to education. 
The dame school, the tutor in the home, private and pa- 
rochial pay schools, apprenticeship training, the pauper- 
school idea, the Latin grammar school, and the college — 
all were typical English institutions brought over by the 
early colonists and established here. For a century and a 
half the textbooks, and many of the teachers, were also im- 
ported from England. After the coming of nationality,
-P-A-G-E-286
258 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
the creation of distinctively American textbooks, and the 
evolution of more American-type schools, we still continued 
to draw our new educational ideas and creations from the 
old mother land. The Sunday School, the Charity School, 
the Church Society idea, the Lancastrian Monitorial Schools, 
and the Infant-School idea all came directly from England 
and were fitted into and onto the slowly evolving native 
American school. Even the Academy idea goes back in part 
to the Puritan academies of England. 
Early French influences. After the French had extended 
aid to us in the War for Independence there was a tendency, 
for a time, to imitate French examples. The University of 
the State of New York, a governing body controlling all 
higher educational activities in the State, established in 1784 
and organized in its permanent form in 1787, shows unmis- 
takably the influence of the chief educational ideas of the 
French revolutionists. Jefferson was a great propagandist 
for French ideas, and tried, unsuccessfully, to secure the 
establishment of a complete system of public education for 
Virginia which would have embraced the best of French 
revolutionary conceptions. His proposed system compre- 
hended the establishment of free elementary schools in 
every “hundred” (township), a number of secondary schools 
scattered throughout the State, and a state college (William 
and Mary) as the culmination of the State’s educational 
system. Had he succeeded, a free education through col- 
lege would have been provided for every worthy boy in 
Virginia, but his scheme was too far in advance of Amer- 
ican educational ideas at the time to be accepted. He 
later (1819) secured the establishment of the University 
of Virginia, which to-day stands as a monument to his 
memory. 
The College of New Orleans, created in 1805 with provi- 
sion for academies for the counties, and the elementary 
school system organized for the State in 1806, were clearly 
modeled after Napoleon’s law of 1802, organizing instruc- 
tion throughout France. Only the college was ever put

into operation. The early constitutional provisions regard- 
ing education in Indiana, providing for a system of free 
education “ascending in regular gradation from township 
schools to State University” (p. 75), probably owed their 
formulation to the influence in the constitutional conven- 
tion of the French refugees then living in Vincennes. The 
founding of the University of Michigan, in 1817, with the 
absurd name of Catholepistemiad, and its whimsical organi- 
zation, embodied the same French idea of a state organi- 
zation of education extending from the elementary school 
to/the university. We have comparatively little, though, 
that can be traced back to French sources, partly because 
we were so soon estranged from France by the unfriendly 
actions of Napoleon, and partly because France had, be- 
fore the estrangement, done so little in education that we 
could imitate. 
Our early isolation and independence. Up to the close 
of the first third of the nineteenth century we remained iso- 
lated and followed purely native lines of development, modi- 
fied, as we have seen, by new ideas brought over from Eng- 
land and a few ideas as to organization from France. We 
were a young and a very independent nation, traveling but 
little, reading but little, and depending almost entirely 
upon our own ideas and resources. Schools were being 
evolved along purely native lines, and adapted to the needs 
of a new nation on a new continent which it was busily en- 
gaged in reducing to civilization. 
Our teachers,and schoolmasters were of the same native 
homespun variety, as were our early leaders as well. They 
were all alike innocent of such a thing as normal training, 
had read no professional literature, had attended few if any 
teachers’ institutes, and knew little as to what even their 
neighbors, much less what peoples in other states and lands, 
were doing in the matter of organizing and directing schools. 
New ideas were spread by teachers moving about rather 
than by other means. As an evidence of this, it was almost 
twenty years after Warren Colburn’s famous Intellectual 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  260 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Arithmetic was published in Boston (1821) before it began 
to be used in New Jersey, “when those who had studied it 
in New England,” according to Murray, “became teachers 
there.” Yet this was the great book of its day, and shaped 
all subsequent teaching of the subject. 
Educational ‘journalism begins. It ‘was not until the 
twenties that our educational literature began, and not 
until the decade between 1835 and 1845 that we really be- 
gan to learn, for the first time, of what had been and was 
being done on the continent of Europe in the matter of 
organizing instruction. ‘The earliest educational journals 
published in the United States were: | A

The circulation of these various journals was not large 
or extended, and for a time was confined almost altogether 
to New England, but they gradually reached the leaders of 
the time, and slowly but positively indheneed public opinion. 
Their great service was that of spreading information as to 
what was being done, and in extending the work of propa- 
ganda for the maintenance of schools. With the beginnings

educational journal was brought out which interpreted for 
American educators the best results of educational practice 
in all lands and times, and greatly extended the vision and 
enlarged the point of view of the American schoolman. 
II. Work anp INFLUENCE or PESTALOZZI 
The inspiration of Pestalozzi. One of the greatest books 
of the eighteenth century, the Emile of Jean-Jacques Rous- 
seau, a French Swiss by birth then living in Paris, appeared 
in 1762. In this Rousseau vigorously attacked the formal- 
ism of the age in religion, manners, and education. The 
book described the education of the boy, Emile, by a new 
plan, that of rejecting the formal teaching of the schools and 
permitting him to grow up and be educated according to na- 
ture. The volume was extensively read, and made a deep 
impression throughout all Europe, but was particularly in- 
fluential among the thinkers of Switzerland. Gathering 
up the current idea of his age that the “state of nature” was 
the ideal one, and the one in which men had been intended 
to live; that the organization of society had created inequali- 
ties which prevented man from realizing his real self; and 
that human duty called for a return to the “state of na- 
ture,” whatever that might be; Rousseau stated them in 
terms of the education of the boy, Emile. Despite its many 
exaggerations, much faulty reasoning, and many imperfec- 
tions, the book had a tremendous influence on Europe in 
laying bare the defects and abuses of the formal and eccle- 
siastical education of the time. Though Rousseau’s enthu- 
siasm took the form of theory run mad, and the educational 
plan he proposed was, largely impossible, he nevertheless 
popularized education.//'He also contributed much to chang- 
ing the point of view in instruction from subject-matter to 
the child to be taught, and the nature of instruction from 
formal religious doctrine, preparatory for life hereafter, to 
the study of the life and universe amid which man lives 
here.'! The iconoclastic nature of Rousseau’s volume may 
be inferred from its opening sentence, where he says: “Every-

thing is good as it comes from the hand of the author of 
nature; everything degenerates in the hands of man.” 
Among those most deeply influenced by Rousseau’s book 
was a young German Swiss by the name of Johann Hein- 
rich Pestalozzi, who was born and brought up in Zurich. 
Inspired by Rousseau’s writings, he spent the early part of 
his life trying to render service to the poor,-and_the latter 
part in-working out for himself a theory.and method _of in= 
struction based-on=the natural development of the child. 
Trying to educate his own child according to Rousseau’s 
plan, he not only discovered its impracticability but also that 
the only way to improve on it was to study the children 
themselves. Accordingly he opened a school and home 
on his farm at Neuhof, in 1774. Here he took in fifty aban- 
doned children, to whom he taught reading, writing, and 
arithmetic, gave them moral discourses, and trained them 
in gardening, farming, and cheese-making. It was an at- 
tempt to regenerate beggars by means of education, which 
Pestalozzi firmly believed could be done. At the end of two 
years he had spent all the money he and his wife possessed, 
and the school closed in failure — a blessing in disguise — 
though with Pestalozzi’s faith in the power of education 
unshaken. Of this experiment he wrote: “For years I have 
lived in the midst of fifty little beggars, sharing in my pov- 
erty my bread with them, living like a beggar myself in order 
to teach beggars to live like men.” 
Turning next to writing, while continuing to farm, Pesta- 
lozzi now tried to express his faith in education in printed 
form. His Leonard and Gertrude (1781) was a wonderfully 
beautiful story of Swiss peasant life, and of the genius 
and sympathy and love of a woman amid degrading sur- 
roundings. From a wretched place the village of Bonnal, 
under Pestalozzi’s pen, was transformed by the power of 
education. The book was a great success from the first, 
and for it Pestalozzi was made a “citizen” of the French 
Republic, along with Washington, Madison, Kosciusko, 
Wilberforce, and Tom Paine. He continued to farm and

to think, though nearly starving, until 1798, when the op- 
portunity for which he was really fitted came. 
Pestalozzi’s educational experiments. In 1798 “The 
Helvetic Republic” was proclaimed, an event which divided 
Pestalozzi’s life into two parts. Up to this time he had 
been interested wholly in the philanthropic aspect. of edu- 
cation, believing that the poor could be regenerated through 
education and labor. From this time on he interested him- 
self in the teaching aspect of the problem, in the working out 
and formulation of a teaching method based on the natural 
development of the child, and in training others to teach. 
Much to the disgust of the authorities of the new Swiss Gov- 
ernment, citizen Pestalozzi applied for service as a school- 
teacher. The opportunity to render such service soon came. 
That autumn the French troops invaded Switzerland, 
and, in putting down the stubborn resistance of the three 
German cantons, they shot down a large number of the 
people. Orphans to the number of 169 were left in the little 
town of Stanz, and citizen Pestalozzi was given charge of 
them. For six months he was father, mother, teacher, and 
nurse. Then, worn out himself, the orphanage was changed 
into a hospital. A little later he became a schoolmaster in 
Burgdorf; was dismissed; became a teacher in another school; 
and finally, in 1800, opened a school himself in an old castle 
there. He provided separate teachers for drawing and 
singing, geography and history, language and arithmetic, 
and gymnastics. The year following the school was en- 
larged into a teachers’ training school, the government ex- 
tending him aid in return for giving Swiss teachers one 
month of training as teachers in his school. Here he wrote 
and published How Gertrude teaches her Children, which ex- 
plained his methods and forms his most important pedagogi- 
cal work; a Guide for teaching Spelling and Reading; and a 
Book for Mothers, devoted to a description of “object teach- 
ing.” In 1805, the castle being needed by the government, 
Pestalozzi moved to Yverdon, where he opened an Institute, 
and where the next twenty years of his life were spent and 
his greatest success achieved. 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
    264 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
The contribution of Pestalozzi. The great contribution, 
of Pestalozzi lay in that, following the lead of Rousseau, he 
rejected the teaching of mere words and facts, which had 
characterized all elementary education up to near-the close 
of the eighteenth century, and tried-instead_to.reduce the 
educational process to a well-organized routine, based on the 
natural and orderly development of the instincts,capacities, 
and powers of the growing child. Taking Rousseau’s idea 
of a return to nature, he tried to apply it to the education 
of children. This led to his rejection of what he called the 
“empty chattering of mere words” and “outward show” 
in the instruction in reading and the catechism, and the in- 
troduction in their place of real studies, based on observa- 
tion, experimentation, and reasoning. “Sense impression” 
became his watchword. As he expressed it, he “tried to or- 
ganize and psychologize the educational process” by har- 
monizing it with the natural development of the child. To 
this end he carefully studied children, and developed his 
methods experimentally as a result of his cbnervatio) To 
such an extreme was this idea carried at Burgdorf and Yver- 
don that all results of preceding educators and writers were 
rejected, for fear that error might creep in. Read noth- 
ing, discover everything, and prove all things, came to be 
the working guides of himself and his teachers. 
The development of man he believed to be organic, and 
to proceed according to law. It was the work of the teacher 
to discover these laws of development and to assist nature 
in securing “a natural, symmetrical, and harmonious de- 
velopment”? of all the “faculties” of the child. (Real edu- 
cation must develop the child as a whole—mentally, phys- 
ically, morally — and called for the training of the head and 
the hand and the heart. The only proper means for develop- 
ing the powers of the child was use, and hence education 
must guide and stimulate self-activity, be based on intuition 
and exercise, and the sense impressions must be organized 
and directed.- Education, too, if it is to follow the organic de- 
velopment of the child, must observe the proper progress

of child development and be graded, so that each step of 
the process shall grow out of the preceding and grow into 
the following stage. To accomplish these ends the train- 
ing must be all-round and harmonious; much liberty must 
be allowed the child in learning; education must proceed 
largely by doing instead of by words; the method of learning 
must be largely analytical; real objects and ideas must pre- _ 
cede symbols and words; and finally the organization and 
correlation of what is learned must be looked after by the 
teacher. / 
Still more, Pestalozzi possessed a deep and abiding faith, 
new at the time, in the power of education as a means of 
regenerating society. He had begun his work by trying 
to “teach beggars to live like men,” and his belief in the 
potency of education in working this transformation, so 
touchingly expressed in his Leonard and Gertrude, never left 
him. ) He believed that each human being could be raised 
through the influence of education to the level of an intel- 
lectually free and morally independent life, and that every 
human being was entitled to the right to attain such freedom 
and independence. The way to this lay through the full use 
of his developing powers, under the guidance of a teacher, 
and not through a process of repeating words and learning 
by heart. Not only the intellectual qualities of perception, 
judgment, and reasoning need exercise, but the moral powers 
as well. To provide such exercise and direction was the 
work of the school. 
© Pestalozzi also resented the brutal discipline which for 
ages had characterized all school instruction, believed it by 
its very nature immoral, and tried to substitute for this a 
strict but loving discipline — a “thinking love,” he calls it 
— and to make the school as-nearly as possible like a gentle 
and refined home. To a Swiss father, who on visiting his 
school exclaimed, “Why. this is not a school, but a fam- 
ily,” Pestalozzi answered that such a statement was the 
greatest praise he could have given him. 
The consequences of these ideas. The educational con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
266 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
sequences of these new ideas were very large. They in time 
gave aim and purpose to the elementary school of the nine- 
teenth century, transforming it from an instrument of the 
Church for church ends, to an instrument of society to be 
used for its own regeneration and the advancement of the 
welfare of all. The introduction of the study of natural ob- 
jects in place of words, and much talking about what was 
seen and studied instead of parrot-like reproductions of the 
words of a book, revolutionized both the methods and the 
subject-matter of instruction in the developing elementary 
school. Observation and investigation tended to super- 
sede mere memorizing; class discussion and thinking to 
supersede the reciting of the words of the book; thinking 
about what was being done to supersede routine learning; 
and class instruction to supersede the wasteful individual 
teaching which had for so long characterized all school work. 
It meant the reorganization of the work of elementary edu- 
cation on a modern basis, with class organization and group 
instruction) 
The work of Pestalozzi also meant the introduction of new 
subject-matter for instruction, the organization of new. 
teaching subjects for the elementary school, and the redirec- 
tion of the elementary education of children. _ Observation 
led to the development of elementary-science study, and the 
study of home geography; talking about what was observed 
led to the study of language usage, as distinct from the older 
study of grammar; and counting and measuring led to the 
study of number, and hence to a new type of primary arith- 
metic. The reading of the school also changed both in char- 
acter and purpose. In other words, in place of an elementary 
education based on reading, a little writing and spelling, 
and the catechism, all of a memoritor type with religious 
ends in view, a new primary school, much more secular in 
character, was created by the work of Pestalozzi. This new 
school was based on the study of real objects, learning 
through sense impressions, the individual expression of ideas, 
child activity, and the development of the child’s powers in

      NEW IDEAS FROM ABROAD 267 
an orderly way. In fact, “the development of the facul- 
ties” of the child became a by-word with Pestalozzi and his 
followers. 
Pestalozzi’s deep abiding faith in the power of education 
to, regenerate society was highly influential in Switzerland, 
throughout Western Europe, and later in America in show- 
jing how to deal-with orphans, vagrants, and those suffering 
“ from, physical defécts or in need of reformation, by providing 
for such@ combination of intellectual and industrial training.) 
The spread and influence of Pestalozzi’s work. So fa- 
mous did the work of Pestalozzi become that his schools at 
Burgdorf and Yverdon came to be “show places,” even in 
a land filled with natural wonders. Observers and students 
came from all over Europe to see and to teach in his school. 
In particular the educators of Prussia were attracted by his 
work, and, earlier than other nations, saw the far-reaching 
significance of his discoveries. Herbart visited his school as 
early as 1799, when but a young man of twenty-three, and 
wrote a very sympathetic description of his new methods. 
Froebel spent the years 1808 to 1810 as a teacher at Yver- 
don, when he was a young man of twenty-six to eight. “It 
soon became evident to me,” wrote Froebel, “that ‘Pesta- 
lozzi’ was to be the watchword of my life.” 
Many Swiss teachers were trained by Pestalozzi, and these 
spread his work and ideas over Switzerland. Particularly 
in German Switzerland did his ideas take root and reorgan- 
ize education. Of his Swiss followers one of the most in- 
fluential was Emanuel Fellenberg, who, adopting Pestaloz- 
zi’s idea of combined intellectual and industrial training, de- 
veloped a combined intellectual and manual-labor school at 
Hofwyl, near Berne, which he conducted very successfully 
from 1806 to 1844. By 1829, when his work was first made 
known to American educators through the articles of Wil- 
liam Woodbridge, his school included: 
1. A farm of about six hundred acres. 
2. Workshops for manufacturing clothing and tools. 
38. A printing and lithographing establishment.  
-P-A-G-E-300
268 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
4. A literary institution for the education of the well-to-do. 
5. A lower school which trained for handicrafts and middle- 
class occupations. 
6. An agricultural school for the education of the poor as farm 
laborers, and as teachers for the rural schools. 
Fellenberg’s work was widely copied in Switzerland, Ger- 
many, England, and the United States, and contained the 
germ-idea of both agricultural and reformatory education. 
Pestalozzi’s ideas in Prussia. (It was in Prussia that 
Pestalozzi’s ideas made the deepest impression, and there 
that they were most successfully 
transplanted and carried out.) As 
early as 1803 an envoy, sent by 
the Prussian king, reported fav- 
orably on the methods used by 
Pestalozzi, and in 1804 Pestaloz- 
zian methods were authorized for 
the primary schools of Prussia. 
In 1807-08, after the severe defeat 
inflicted on Prussia by Napoleon, 
the German philosopher Fichte, 
who had taught in Zurich and 
knew Pestalozzi, exploited Pes- 
talozzi’s work in Berlin, and 
emphasized the importance of 
reorganizing the work of the com- 
mon schools of Prussia, as a phase 
of the work of national regenera- 6 i i i Educates Educates tion, along the lines laid down

trol; and the basis of the strong military state which set 
Europe afire in 1914 was laid. 
The Prussian Government now sent seventeen teachers 
to Switzerland to spend three years, at the expense of the 
Government, in studying Pestalozzi’s ideas and methods, 
and they were particularly enjoined that they were not sent 
primarily to get the mechanical side of this method, but to 
warm yourselves at the sacred fire which burns in the heart of this 
man, so full of strength and love, whose work has remained so far 
below what he originally desired, below the essential ideas of his 
life, of which the method is only a feeble product. 
You will have reached perfection when you have clearly seen 
that education is an art, and the most sublime and holy of all, and 
in what connection it is with the great art of the education of 
nations. 
On their return these, and others, spread Pestalozzian ideas 
throughout Prussia, and so effective was their work, and so 
readily did the Prussian people catch the spirit of Pesta- 
lozzi’s endeavors, that at the Berlin celebration of the cen- 
tennial of his birth, in 1846, the German educator Diester- 
weg said: 
By these men and these means, men trained in the Institution 
at Yverdon under Pestalozzi, the study of his publications, and the 
a. nlications of his methods in the model and normal schools of 
Prus <a, after 1808, was the present Prussian, or rather Prussian- 
Pestalozzian school system established, for he is entitled to at 
least one-half the fame of the German popular schools. 
Pestalozzianism in England. Pestalozzi’s ideas were 
also carried to England, but in no such satisfactory manner 
as to the German States. ) Where German lands received 
both the method and the spirit, the English obtained only 
the form. The introduction into England was due chiefly 
to the Reverend Charles Mayo and his sister Elizabeth, but 
England was at that time so deeply immersed in monitorial 
instruction that the country was not in a frame of mind to 
profit greatly from the new ideas. Mayo spent the years 
1819-22 at Yverdon, when Pestalozzi’s institute was in its
-P-A-G-E-302

decline, rent by dissensions, and rapidly approaching its end. 
On his return to England he opened a private Pestalozzian 
school for children of the wealthy. His sister shortly after- 
ward published a Pestalozzian manual for teachers, called 
Lessons on Objects, but missed the spirit of Pestalozzi’s 
work, The lessons were formal, scientific, far too detailed 
and analytical; and much beyond the comprehension of 
children. 
For example, if common salt were the “object” for the 
lesson, the children would be expected to learn its chemical 
composition, its uses, how and where found in nature, how 
mined and refined, that its crystalline form is cubical, that 
it varies in color from white to bluish and reddish, that it 
is transparent to translucent, that it is soluble in water and 
saline in taste, that it imparts a yellow color to a flame, 
etc., without more contact with a piece of real salt than see- 
ing the “specimen” passed around by the teacher. ‘“‘Ob- 
ject teaching” soon became the great educational fad in 
England, and was later brought to the United States. The 
effect of this instruction was to “formalize” the Pesta- 
lozzian movement in England, and in consequence much of 
the finer spirit and significance of Pestalozzi’s work was lost. 
The Mayos were prominent in the Infant-School move- 
ment, which made such great headway in England after 
about 1820, and in 1836 they helped organize “The Home 
and Colonial Infant Society” to spread the idea at home and 
abroad. This Society adopted the English interpretation 
of Pestalozzian methods, established a Model Infant School 
and a Training College for teachers, and had an important 
influence in introducing the English type of formalized 
Pestalozzianism into the schools of the United States. 
Ill. Earty American TRAVELERS AND OrricIAL REPorTS 
Early American travelers. Our first contact with the edu- 
cational thought and practices of continental Europe came 
through some half-dozen Americans who studied at the 
Prussian university of Gottingen, then almost unknown

  NEW IDEAS FROM ABROAD 271 
outside of German lands, before 1820.\ Our first contact with 
the work of Pestalozzi in Switzerland came through Joseph 
Naef, one of Pestalozzi’s teachers, who came to America and 
taught a private school in Philadelphia for a time between 
1806 and 1809, and who later wandered westward and for a 
short time taught in a little communistic colony at New 
Harmony, Indiana. So little had been done, though, in de- 
veloping public education with us before 1810, south of New 
England and New York, that Naef’s work remained almost 
unknown) while those who had studied at Géttingen in- 
fluenced educational development, even in the colleges of 
the time, but very little. 
Our first real contact with continental European ideas 
and accomplishments in education came in 1819, through 
the publication in this country of A Year in Europe, written 
by Professor John Griscom, of New York, who had spent 
the year 1818-19 in visiting the schools, colleges, and chari- 
table institutions of Great Britain, Holland, France, Swit- 
zerland, and Italy. His description of his visit to Pestalozzi 
awakened some interest, and his volume was read by the 
leading thinkers of the day. Our city and state school sys- 
tems, though, were as yet hardly under way, Lancastrianism 
was at its height, and Griscom’s work influenced our com- 
mon-school development scarcely at all. Griscom’s de- 
scription of the high school at Edinburgh, though, probably 
gave the name to the new school at Boston (p. 190) and 
to the American secondary school as well. 
The chief influence of the book proved to be along the 
lines of reformatory and charitable education, in which we 
were just making a beginning. Griscom told what had been 
done along these lines in Europe. This information was 
welcomed by the few Americans interested in such develop- 
ment and came as a valuable contribution at the time. 
( Another early American traveler was William C. Wood- 
bridge, of New England, who spent the year 1820 and the 
years 1825-29 in Europe. It was he who, through his enthu- 
siastic “Letters,” published in Russell’s American Journal  
-P-A-G-E-304
272 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
of Education, and elsewhere, first really brought the work 
of the Swiss reformers — Pestalozzi and Fellenberg — to 
the attention of American teachers. After his return he 
published two textbooks on geography (1824, 1833), based 
on Pestalozzian methods) d it was he who inspired Lowell 
Mason to offer his services, in 1836, to introduce music into 
the schools of Boston. This was probably the first teaching 
-of music in the schools of the United States, so successful 
with us up to that time had been the Calvinistic idea of the 
repression as irreligious of all joyful and artistic instincts. 
Even this start was a failure, and it was a quarter of a cen- 
tury later before music and drawing became generally rec- 
ognized as subjects of study, even in the better city schools. 
Cousin’s Report on German education. The first docu- 
ment describing European schools which made any deep 
impression on those then engaged in organizing our Ameri- 
can state school systems was an English translation of the 
famous Report on the Condition of Public Instruction in Ger- 
many, and particularly Prussia, made to the French Govern- 
ment by Victor Cousin, in 1831 and publicly printed the next 
year. This Report was reprinted in England, in 1834, and 
the first half of it, explaining the administrative organiza- 
tion of Prussian education and the Prussian system of peo- 
ple’s schools, was reprinted in New York City, in 1835. 
After the overthrow of the old restored monarchy in 
France, in 1830, a new government was set up, supported by 
the leading thinkers of the time. One of the most impor- 
tant measures to which attention was at once turned was 
the creation of a state school system for France. Cousin 
was sent to Prussia to study what was then the best state 
school system in Europe, and so convincing was his Report 
that, despite bitter national antipathies, it carried convic- 
tion throughout France and was deeply influential in se- 
curing the creation of the first French national schools, in 
1833. The church control of the school committees was 
broken, the examination of teachers was required, thirty 
new normal schools to train teachers were established, state  
-P-A-G-E-305
  NEW IDEAS FROM ABROAD 278 
aid for primary and infant schools was provided, freedom of 
religious instruction was guaranteed, recommendation was 
changed to obligation, and both state and local supervision 
were instituted. The modern‘state school system of France 
dates from the Law of 1833, and this from Cousin’s Report. 
Influence of Cousin’s Report in the United States. The 
translation of Cousin’s Report into English and the publica- 
tion of half of it in the United States came just as our new 
state school systems were beginning to take form, and just 
as the battle for state control was in full swing. Its con- 
vincing description of the strong Prussian state school organ- 
ization, under a state minister, and with state control over 
so many matters, was everywhere of value in this country, 
It gave support to the demands of the few leaders of the 
time who were struggling to reduce the rampant district 
system to some semblance of order, and who were trying 
to organize the thousands of little community school sys- 
tems in each State into one state school system, under some 
form of centralized control. Though actually influencing 
legislation in but one or two of our States, the two main 
ideas gained from it were the importance of some form of 
centralized state control, and the training of teachers in state 
normal schools. These influences were evident chiefly 
in Michigan and Massachusetts. 
The publication of the Report came just as Michigan was 
organizing to enter the Union as a State, and two leaders 
there — John D. Pierce, a minister who became the first 
head of the state school system, and General Isaac E. Crary, 
chairman of the committee on education in the constitutional 
convention — obtained a copy of it and were deeply im- 
pressed by Cousin’s statements. They discussed together 
“the fundamental principles which were deemed important 
for the convention to adopt,” and it was agreed by them 
that education “‘should be made a distinct branch of the gov- 
ernment, and that the constitution ought to provide for an 
officer who should have the whole matter in charge and thus 
keep its importance perpetually before the public mind.”
-P-A-G-E-306
274 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Largely as a result of their efforts Michigan was the first 
State to take the 16th section school lands, given by the Na- 
tional Government for schools, from the control of the town- 
ships and place them under the control of the State, and like- 
wise the first State to create the appointive office (a pure 
Prussian imitation) of State Superintendent of Public In- 
struction. The first constitution also made very definite 
provision for a state system of schools and a state univer- 
sity. 
A later superintendent of public instruction in Michigan, 
writing in 1852 on the history of the system, said that “the 
system of public instruction which was intended to be es- 
tablished by the framers of the constitution, the conception 
_ of the office, its province, its powers, and duties were de- 
‘rived from Prussia.”’ That Cousin’s Report influenced the 
class-organization or class-work of the Michigan schools, or 
the schools of any other State for that matter, is a conten- 
tion recently advanced which the facts scarcely warrant. 
In Massachusetts the Report came just in time to give 
useful support to Brooks, Carter, Mann, and the few others 
interested who weré trying there to secure the establishment 
of the first American state normal school. The normal- 
school idea in America, though, as we shall point out a little 
later, was of native American growth, and had clearly taken 
form before Prussian normal schools were known of in this 
country. The descriptions of the Prussian training schools 
for teachers only awakened a new support and helped along 
more rapidly a movement which was then well under way 
as a purely native development. 
Stowe’s Report on Elementary Education in Europe. In 
1829 there was formed at Cincinnati the “Western Aca- 
demic Institute and Board of Education,” and for a decade 
this was practically the only active organization for educa- 
tion in the State of Ohio. It was a private propaganda or- 
ganization, and included in its membership such men as 
Lyman Beecher, Samuel Lewis, and Professor Calvin E. 
Stowe. Money was raised, an agent (Lewis) was sent to    
-P-A-G-E-307
NEW IDEAS FROM ABROAD 275 
visit the schools of the State, reports as to conditions were 
prepared, and delegations were sent to the legislature to 
urge action. When Professor Stowe started for Europe, in 
1836, to buy a library for the Lane Theological Seminary, 
with which he was connected, the “Institute’’ induced the 
legislature of Ohio to commission him to examine and report 
on the systems of elementary instruction found there. The 
result was his celebrated Report on Elementary Education 
in Europe, made to the legislature in 1837. 
This was the first report on European educational condi- 
tions by an American which attracted general attention. In 
it he contrasted educational conditions in Ohio with those 
of Prussia and Wiirtemberg, with particular reference to the 
organization and thoroughness of the instruction, and the 
maintenance of institutions for imparting to prospective 
teachers some knowledge of the science and art of teaching. 
The meager legal requirements in Ohio of instruction in read- 
ing and writing and arithmetic, with school trustees fre- 
quently forbidding instruction in any higher branches; the 
untrained and poorly educated teachers, and the absence in 
the State of any means of training teachers; he contrasted 
with the enriched elementary-school curriculum, the Pesta- 
lozzian methods, and the well-informed and trained teachers 
of Prussia and Wiirtemberg. The Report commanded the ad- 
miration of legislators and educators, was widely read, and 
“not a little of the advancement in common schools,” says 
Barnard, “during the next twenty years may be traced to 
this Report.” The legislature of Ohio ordered ten thousand 
copies of it printed, and a copy sent to every school district 
in the State. It was later ordered reprinted and circulated 
by vote of the legislatures of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, North Carolina, and Virginia. 
In his summary Professor Stowe said: 
But perhaps some will be ready to say, “The scheme is indeed 
an excellent one, provided only it were practicable; but the idea of 
introducing so extensive and complete a course of study into our 
common schools is entirely visionary, and can never be realized,”
-P-A-G-E-308
  276 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
I answer, that it is no theory that I have been exhibiting, but a 
matter of fact, a copy of actual practice. The above system is no 
visionary scheme, emanating from the closet of a recluse, but a 
sketch of the course of instruction now actually pursued by thou- 
sands of schoolmasters, in the best district schools that have ever 
been organized. It can be done; for it has been done — it is now 
done: and it ought to be done. If it can be done in Europe, I 
believe it can be done in the United States: if it can be done in 
Prussia, I know it can be done in Ohio. 
To show how much influence this Report had with legisla- 
tures in Ohio it might be added that it was not until 1848 
that grammar and geography were added to the narrow ele- 
mentary-school curriculum, not until 1853 that the rate-bill 
was abandoned and the schools made free, and almost three 
quarters of a century before the first state normal school 
was established by the State. 
Barnard, Bache, and Dr. Julius. In the years 1835-37 
Henry Barnard visited the schools of the different countries 
of Europe, and from this visit dates his interest in intro- 
ducing into our state school systems the best of European, 
organization and practices, — an interest he retained all 
his active life. He made no special report at the time of 
his visit, but through the pages of the educational journals 
which he edited, for the next forty years, he continued to set 
before his readers interesting descriptions of educational or- 
ganization and practices in other states and lands. He also 
gathered together the important parts of all these reports 
and issued them in book form, in 1854, under the title Na- 
tional Education in Europe. 
In 1836 the trustees of the newly founded Girard College, 
at Philadelphia, an institution for the education of orphans, 
sent Professor A. D. Bache “to visit all establishments in 
Europe resembling Girard College.” On his return, in 1839, 
his Report on Education in Europe was printed. In this he 
devoted about two hundred pages to an enthusiastic de- 
scription of Pestalozzian methods as he had seen them in 
the schools of Holland, and also described the German 
Gymnasium.
-P-A-G-E-309
  NEW IDEAS FROM ABROAD QT7 
In 1835 a Dr. H. Julius, of Hamburg, crossed the ocean 
with the Reverend Charles Brooks, of Hingham, Massa- 
chusetts, and during the forty-one days of the passage from 
Liverpool to New York, described to him the Prussian sys- 
tem of elementary schools. Through Brooks’s efforts Dr. 
Julius was invited to give an account of the Prussian sys- 
tem of education before the committee on education of the 
Massachusetts legislature, but “his delineations, though 
clear and judicious, were so brief as led to no action.” What 
he had to say was printed by the State, and later on reprinted 
by New York State. There is no evidence that what Dr. 
Julius said had much influence, except with the Reverend 
Mr. Brooks, but upon him the Prussian idea of institutions 
for training teachers made a deep impression, as we shall 
see a little further on. 
Mann’s Famous Seventh Report. In 1843 Horace Mann 
spent some months visiting schools in Great Britain, Bel- 
gium, Holland, the German States, and France, and on his 
return devoted his Seventh Report (1843) to a description and 
appraisal of what he had seen, but with particular reference 
to the studies taught, classification of pupils, methods of 
teaching, teachers, discipline, and the training of teachers. 
Of this Report Hinsdale writes: 
Read half a century after it was written, the Seventh Report 
impresses the reader as being the work of an open-minded man, 
who is making a hurried examination of educational institutions 
that were before known to him only at second hand. The matter 
is copious; facts and ideas fairly crowd the pages. The writer is 
evidently anxious to discover and report the exact truth. He 
wants to show his countrymen the schools just as he sees them. 
He has no prejudices against things that are foreign. The writer 
not only has a first-hand interest in the subject, but is also con- 
scious that he is writing things new and strange to his audience. 
. .. We are so familiar with these things now that we may wonder ° 
at Mr. Mann’s enthusiasm over them; but we must remember 
that a half century has wrought great changes in American schools, 
changes that in some measure have grown out of the very docu- 
ment we are reading.  
-P-A-G-E-310
278 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Mr. Mann ranked the schools of the different. countries 
he visited in the following order: Prussia, Saxony, the west- 
ern and southern German states, Holland, Scotland, Ireland, 
France, Belgium, and, lowest of all, England. The lack of 
a national system of education in England, in which the 
whole people participated, he felt was full of admonition to 
the people of Massachusetts, as it was a condition toward 
which they were drifting before the work of Carter and the 
organization of the State Board of Education. The schools 
of the German States, with their Pestalozzian methods and 
subject-matter, trained and well-informed teachers, oral in- 
struction, mild discipline, class organization, normal schools 
for teachers, and intelligent supervision, particularly won 
his enthusiastic approval. “There are many things abroad 
which we at home should do well to imitate,” he wrote, 
“things, some of which are here as yet matters of ‘specula- 
tion and theory, but which, there, have long been in opera- 
tion and are now producing a harvest of rich and abundant 
blessings,” 4 
His controversy with the Boston schoolmasters. This 
Report might have exerted no greater influence than other 
previous Reports, and possibly even less, had it not been the 
last straw to the Boston school principals, many of whom 
had appropriated to themselves the Secretary’s previous 
sharp criticism of school conditions in Massachusetts. There 
had been no comparisons made in the Report between the 
schools of Massachusetts and those of Prussia and Saxony, 
or of Boston with Hamburg or Dresden, but the Boston mas- 
ters, many of whom shared the opposition that the crea- 
tion of the State Board of Education had awakened, and 
stung by such expressions in the Report as “ignorance of 
teachers,” and “sleepy supervision,” felt called upon to at- 
tack the Report in a very personal and offensive manner. A 
committee of the Principals’ Association accordingly issued 
a book of 144 pages, attacking and replying to the Report of 
Mr. Mann. Two months later Mr. Mann replied, in a 
volume of 176 pages, in which he not only vindicated him- 
 
-P-A-G-E-311
NEW IDEAS FROM ABROAD 279 
self and what he had written, and pointed out the difficul- 
ties with which he had to contend arising from unintelligent 
criticism, but, feeling that the attack on him had been un- 
provoked and uncalled for, he retaliated on his assailants 
with terrible severity. Though he objected to severe pun- 
ishment for children, he apparently had no objection to giv- 
ing a sound drubbing to a body of schoolmasters. Part of 
the masters later replied to Mr. Mann’s reply, and he again 
responded to them in kind. This ended the controversy, 
public opinion being too thoroughly against the school- 
masters to warrant its further continuance. 
The result of this unexpected public debate was to at- 
tract very much more attention to Mr. Mann’s Seventh ~ 
Report than would otherwise have been given to it, to fix the 
attention of the public generally on the need for educational 
improvement, and to add to Mr. Mann’s importance in the 
history of American education. In particular it gave sup- 
port to the recently established normal schools, and to the 
efforts of a few to improve instruction by the adoption of a 
better classification of pupils and Pestalozzian methods and 
subject-matter. The result was that Mr. Mann’s report on 
European school pract ces proved to be the most influential 
of all the Reports on education in Europe. 
The Fellenberg manual-labor movement. The one Eu- 
ropean idea which we did adopt almost bodily, because we 
had no previous development of the kind, and because we 
found it so well suited to early democratic conditions among 
a people of little wealth, was the Pestalozzian idea, worked 
out by Fellenberg and his followers at Hofwyl, in Switzer- 
land, of combining manual labor with schooling. Early in 
our national history the interest in farming was strong, the 
first farmers’ journals were established, and there soon arose 
a demand for special schools for farmers’ sons. The advan- 
tages, both pecuniary and educational, of combining school- 
ing and farming made a strong appeal in the days when 
money was scarce and opportunities limited, and such 
schools, drawing their inspiration from the very successful  
-P-A-G-E-312
280 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
school of Fellenberg, were founded first in Connecticut, in 
1819; Maine in 1821; Massachusetts in 1824; New York in 
1827; and New Jersey in 1830. The purpose in each was 
to unite training in agriculture with the studies of the school, 
and thus give to farmers’ boys a double type of training. 
The idea was soon extended to the rapidly rising mechanical 
pursuits, and manual-labor institutions of a mechanical 
type also arose. The Oneida School of Science and Industry, 
the Genesee Manual-Labor School, the Aurora Manual- 
Labor Seminary, and the Rensselaer School, all in New 
York, were among the most important of these early insti- 
tutions. The Andover Theological Seminary also adopted 
the plan, and by 1835 the manual-labor-school idea had 
been tried in a dozen States, extending from Maine to Illi- 
nois. Many of the institutions thus founded became col- 
leges later on, as for example the Indiana Baptist Manual- 
Labor Institute, which later became Franklin College; the 
Wabash Manual-Labor Seminary, in Indiana, which later 
became Wabash College; and the Knox Manual-Labor Col- 
lege, in Illinois, which later became Knox College. In 1831 
the short-lived “Manual Labor Society for Promoting Man- 
ual Labor in Literary Institutions” was formed in New 
York to promote the idea. This Society also added gym- 
nastics to its program, and the early recognition of the value 
of physical training in the schools of the United States is in 
part due to the interest awakened in it by the work of this 
Seciety. In 1833 the governor of Indiana recommended to 
the legislature the establishment of manual-labor acade- 
mies to train teachers for the schools of the State, and in 1886 
a resolution was offered in the United States Senate propos- 
ing “a grant of public lands to one or more colleges in each 
of the new States for educating the poor upon the manual- 
labor system.” 
The manual-labor idea, however, was short-lived in this 
country. ‘The rise of cities and wealth and social classes 
was against the idea, and the opening up of cheap and rich 
farms to the westward, with the change of the East from
-P-A-G-E-313
  NEW IDEAS FROM ABROAD 281 
agriculture to manufacturing, turned the agricultural aspect 
of the movement aside for a generation. When it reappeared 
again in the Central West it came in the form of a new de- 
mand for colleges to teach agriculture and mechanic arts, 
but with the manual-labor idea omitted. 
General result of these foreign influences. The general 
result of these various observations by travelers and official 
Reports, extending over nearly a quarter of a century in time; 
and the work of the newer educational journals, particularly 
the publication work of Henry Barnard; was to give to Amer- 
ican educators some knowledge of different and better school 
organizations elsewhere. In particular they gave strong 
support to the movement, already well under way, to organ- 
ize the many local school systems into state school systems, 
subjecting them to state oversight and control; further stim- 
ulated the movement, already well begun, to grade and clas- 
sify the schools in a more satisfactory manner; helped to 
inaugurate a movement for the introduction of Pestaloz- 
zian methods to replace the wasteful individual and the 
mechanical Lancastrian plans which had for so long been in 
use; and gave material assistance to the few leaders in Mas- 
sachusetts and New York who were urging the establish- 
ment by the State of professional training for teachers for 
the educational service. The distinctively state school 
organization provided for in the Michigan constitution of 
1835, and the creation of the first state normal schools in 
the United States in Massachusetts, in 1838, are in part 
directly traceable to the influence of German practice, as 
described in these Reports. The one idea we for a time 
tried to copy and adapt to our needs was the Fellenberg 
manual-labor school for combining instruction in agricul- 
ture with the study of books. The later introduction of a 
form of Pestalozzian procedure into our normal schools and 
city school systems, and later into all our schools, to which 
we next turn, also is traceable in part to the interest awak- 
ened in better classroom practice by the descriptions of 
Pestalozzian instruction in other lands.
-P-A-G-E-314
    282 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
That we at this time adopted the German Volkschule, as 
has recently been asserted, an examination of the evidence will 
show was hardly the case. Not only did we not adopt its cur- 
riculum, or spirit, or method of instruction, but we did not 
adopt even its graded system. The Volkschule is a definite 
eight-year school, while we worked out and have ever since 
retained seven-year, eight-year, and nine-year elementary 
schools, in different parts of the United States. That the 
elementary school we developed was in general an eight- 
year school, as in the German Volkschule, was due to the 
school age of children and to a perfectly natural native de- 
velopment, rather than to any copying of foreign models. 
The great thing we got from the study of Prussian schools 
was not a borrowing or imitation of any part or feature — 
our own development had been proceeding naturally and 
steadily toward the lines we eventually followed, long before 
we knew of Prussian work — but rather a marked stimulus 
to a further and faster development along lines which were 
already well under way. .

CHAPTER X 
THE REORGANIZATION OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 
I. Tue Risz or THE Normat Scuoou 
Beginnings of the teacher-training idea. The first train- 
ing class for teachers organized in the world was a small 
local school organized by Father Démia, at Lyons, France, 
in 1672. Stimulated into activity by the results of the 
Protestant Revolt, he had begun schools in his parish to 
teach reading and the catechism to the children of his pa- 
rishioners. Not being satisfied with the volunteer teachers 
he could obtain, he organized them into a class that he might 
impart to them the ideas he had as to teaching. The first 
real normal school was that founded at Rheims, France, in 
1685, by Abbé de la Salle, to educate and train teachers for 
the schools of the order he had founded — “The Brothers 
of the Christian Schools” — to give free religious primary 
education to the children of the working classes of France. 
He later founded a second school of the kind in Paris, and 
called each institution a “Seminary for Schoolmasters.” In 
addition to imparting a general education of the type of the 
time and a thorough grounding in religion, his student teach- 
ers were trained to teach in practice-schools, under the di- 
rection of experienced teachers. 
The beginning of teacher-training in German lands was 
Francke’s -Seminarium Preceptorum, established at Halle, 
Prussia, in 1697. In 1738 Julius Hecker, one of Francke’s 
teachers, established the first regular seminary for teachers 
in Prussia, and in 1748 he established a private Lehrer- 
seminar in Berlin. In these two institutions he first showed 
the German people the possibilities of special training for 
teachers. It was not, however, until 1819 that the Prus- 
sian Government established normal schools to train teach- 
ers for its elementary or peoples’ schools.
-P-A-G-E-318
    286 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
In 1808, as a part of the reorganization of higher educa- 
tion in France by Napoleon, the Ecole Normale Supérieure 
(higher normal school) of France was created, and between 
1831 and 1833 thirty new normal schools were established 
by the new French government. Pestalozzi had trained 
teachers in his methods of instruction at Burgdorf and Yver- 
don, from 1800 to 1825, but the Swiss did little with the idea 
until later. Both the Lancastrian and the Bell monitorial 
systems of education in England, which developed about the 
beginning of the nineteenth century, had trained their moni- 
tors for teachers, but the first “Training College” for teach- 
ers in England dates from 1835. 
Of all this development, excepting the work of Pesta- 
lozzi, we in America were ignorant until about 1835. By 
that time we were so well on the way toward the creation 
of native American training schools that the knowledge 
of what Prussia and France had done, which came in then 
through the Reports of Cousin, Julius, and Stowe, merely 
stimulated a few enthusiastic workers to help carry more 
rapidly into effect the establishment of the first training 
schools for American teachers. 
The Independent American development. As early as 
the founding of Franklin’s Academy at Philadelphia (p. 185) 
in 1756, one of the purposes specified in its establishment 
was “that others of the lesser sort might be trained as 
teachers.” In an article in the Massachusetts Magazine, for 
June, 1789, on “The Importance of Studying the English 
Language Grammatically,” the author recommends the 
establishment of institutions to prepare “young gentle- 
men for schoolkeeping.” In a commencement address at 
Yale College, in 1816, on “The State of Education in Con- 
necticut,” by Denison Olmstead, a plan for “an academy 
for schoolmasters” was outlined and urged, to prepare in- 
tending teachers for “the organization and government of 
a school.” In 1823 two papers appeared, one by William 
Russell, urging the establishment of such schools, and in 
1825 two more, and to these four papers Mr. Barnard traces 
 
-P-A-G-E-319
  ELEMENTARY EDUCATION REORGANIZED 287 
much of the early interest in teacher training in the United 
States. As early as 1820 Mr. James G. Carter (p. 164), 
often called the “Father of the Massachusetts School Sys- 
tem and of Normal Schools,” published a pamphlet in which 
he suggested an “institution for the training of teachers,” 
and during 1824-25 he published numerous newspaper 
articles and public appeals for the establishment of such an 
institution. In 1827 he showed his faith in such schools 
by opening one himself, at Lancaster, Massachusetts, and 
petitioning the legislature of the State for aid. This was 
probably the second school of its kind in America. 
From this time on many articles, widely scattered in 
place of publication, appeared urging that something be 
done by the States in the matter. The demand which now 
arose for teacher-training institutions was only another 
phase of the new democratic movement throughout the 
country, which was calling for both votes and schools. The 
general enlightenment of the people having been conceived 
as essential to the protection and preservation of republican 
institutions, it was important, as Governor Clinton expressed 
it, that the “mind and morals of the rising and perhaps the 
destinies of all future generations, be not entrusted to the 
guardianship of incompetence.” 
~ Our first teacher-training school. The first teacher-train- 
ing school in America was established privately, in 1823, 
by the Reverend Samuel R. Hall, who opened a tuition 
school for training teachers at Concord,-Vermont. This 
he continued there until 1830; at Andover, Massachusetts, 
until 1837; and at Plymouth, New Hampshire, until 1840. 
He offered a three-years’ course, based on a common-school 
education, which reviewed the common-school branches; 
studied much mathematics, some book chemistry and natu- 
ral philosophy, logic, astronomy, evidences of Christianity, 
moral and intellectual philosophy; and, in the third term of 
the third year, took up a new study which he called the “Art 
of Teaching.” Practice teaching was obtained by teaching 
during the winter in the rural schools. It was the typical 
   
-P-A-G-E-320
288 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
academy training of the time, with the Art of Teaching 
added. Without a professional book to guide him, and 
relying only on his experience in teaching, Hall tried to tell 
his pupils how to organize and manage a school. To make 
clear his ideas he wrote out a series of Lectures on School- 
keeping, which some friends induced him to publish. This 
appeared in 1829, and was the first professional book in Eng- 
lish issued in America. It was a success from the first, 
illustrating the rising professional interest of the time. The 
acting superintendent of common schools of New York or- 
dered ten thousand copies of it for distribution through- 
out the State, and a committee on education in Kentucky 
recommended that the same be done for that State. 
The academies begin teacher-training. The Lancas- 
trian higher schools in New York and elsewhere had, by 
1810, evolved classes for educating monitors as teachers, ana 
Governor Clinton, in 1826, reeommended to the legislature 
of New York the establishment by the State of “a seminary 
for the education of teachers in the monitorial system of 
instruction.” In 1827, he recommended the creation of “a 
central school in each county for the education of teachers.” 
Again, in 1828, he recommended the establishment of county 
monitorial high schools, “a measure so well calculated to raise 
the character of our schoolmasters and to double the power 
of our artisans by giving them a scientific education.” 
Still earlier (1821) the Board of Regents of the State of 
New York had declared that it was to the academies of the 
State “that we must look for a supply of teachers for the 
common school,” and the committee of the legislature, to 
whom Governor Clinton’s recommendations had been re- 
ferred, thought as had the Regents. The result was the New 
York law of 1827, appropriating state aid to the academies 
“to promote the education of teachers.” In the Annual 
Report of the Regents for 1828 we find the statement that 
the academies have become, in the opinion of the Regents, what it 
has always been desirable they should be, fit Seminaries for im-

parting instruction in the higher branches of English education, 
and especially for qualifying teachers of Common Schools. 
In the Report for 1831 two academies report “Principles of 
Teaching” as a new subject of study, and by 18365 five were 
offering instruction in this new subject. In 1834 the New 
York Legislature enacted “the first law in this country 
making provision for the professional education of teachers 
for common schools.” After providing for state aid to one 
academy in each of the eight judicial districts of the State, 
the law reads: 
The trustees of academies to which any distribution of money 
shall be made by virtue of this act shall cause the same to be 
expended in educating teachers of common schools in such manner 
and under such regulations as said Regents shall prescribe. 
Excepting the Lancastrian monitorial schools, and the 
private schools of Hall and Carter, this was the first form 
of the normal school idea in the United States. In this form 
the training of teachers was continued in New York State 
until the establishment of the first State Normal School, at 
Albany, in 1844, with David Page as principal. In 1849 
teacher-training in the academies was reéstablished, and still 
exists in the high schools of the State. 
The training of teachers in the academies now became 
common everywhere. Among the older and more impor- 
tant ones, Phillips Andover, for example, introduced an 
English course primarily to train teachers, and many other 
New England academies did the same. To the south and 
westward many academies also added instruction intended 
for teachers, and several offered instruction for teachers on 
the manual-labor part-time plan. In Indiana, Governor 
Noble, in 1833, recommended to the legislature, “that semi- 
naries be fitted to instruct and prepare teachers,” and sug- 
gested that state aid be granted to one or more such insti- 
tutions “for the preparation of young men as teachers for 
the township schools on the manual labor system.” 
The training offered was almost entirely academic, as it
-P-A-G-E-322
290 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
was also in the first state normal schools as well, there being 
as yet no professional body of knowledge to teach. There 
was as yet no organized psychology; child study had not 
been thought of; and there was no organized history of 
education, applied psychology, philosophy of education, or 
methodology of instruction. Principles of teaching and 
school management, taught by lectures and almost entirely 
out of the personal experience of the principal of the school, 
was about all of professional instruction there was to give. 
This constituted one study, and the remainder of the time 
was given to reviews of the common-school subjects and to 
advanced academic studies. 
Our first state normal schools. The publication of the 
Reports by Cousin (1835) and Stowe (1837), with their 
descriptions of the teacher-training seminaries of Prussia, 
together with the contact of Dr. Julius and the Reverend 
Charles Brooks (1845), united to give valuable support to 
the efforts of Carter, Mann, and a few others in Massachu- 
setts who were laboring to inaugurate such schools there. 
Carter, in particular, had been at work on the idea for a 
decade and a half, and on his election to the legislature, in 
1835, he began a campaign that resulted in the creation of 
the State Board of Education in 1837, and the first American 
state normal schools in 1838. Though the law gave no name 
to these new institutions, they soon settled down to that of 
Normal Schools — a distinctively French term. 
While Carter worked with the legislature, Brooks worked. 
with the people, traveling over two thousand miles in his 
chaise and at his own expense throughout Massachusetts, 
during the years 1835-38, explaining the Prussian system of 
teacher-training and the Massachusetts need for such, and 
everywhere awakening interest in the idea by his enthusi- 
astic portrayal. Finally a citizen of Boston, Mr. Edmund 
Dwight, authorized Mr. Mann to say to the legislature 
that he would personally give $10,000 for the project, if the 
State of Massachusetts would give a similar amount. A 
bill to this effect was put through by Carter, then chairman

of the committee on education in the State Senate, and the 
new State Board of Education was authorized to expend 
_ the money “in qualifying teachers for the common schools 
of Massachusetts.” No schools were created and no plans 
were laid down, everything being left to Mr. Mann and the 
Board to decide. After mature deliberation it was deter- 
mined not to follow the New York plan of aiding academies, 
but instead to create special state schools for the purpose, 
as had been done in France and in German lands.

On July 3, 1839, the first state normal school in the United 
States was opened in the town hall at Lexington, Massa- 
chusetts, with one instructor and three students. At the 
close of the first quarter there were but twelve students, 
and at the end of three years but thirty-one. The course 
of instruction was one year in length, but could be extended 
to two years. It was much the same as Hall’s earlier one, 
but the distinctive feature of the school was the addition 
of a Model School, in which the students observed and 
taught. 
The opening of this first school was not particularly aus-
-P-A-G-E-326

292 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
picious. Few knew what such a school was to be. Many 
teachers regarded its creation as derogatory to them. Many 
academies did not especially welcome its competition. Not 
a note of congratulation welcomed the new principal to his 
post. Only a few zealots in the cause of reform looked upon 
its opening with favor. Much depended on the new prin- 
cipal, and of him Horace Mann later wrote: “Had it not 
been for Mr. Cyrus Pierce, I consider that the cause of nor- 
mal schools would have failed, or have been postponed for 
an indefinite period.” As it was the new schools had to 
weather legislative storms for a decade before they became 
firmly established as parts of the school system of the State. 
It is indeed fortunate that this new institution was created 
‘and its period of trial carried through in Massachusetts, 
under the care of so able an advocate and protector as Mr. 
Mann. Massachusetts was without doubt the only State 
in the Union where state normal schools could have been 
established at so early a date, or where, if established, they 
would have been allowed to remain. 
On September 5th, 1839, the State Board of Education 
opened another normal school at Barre, and the third at 
Bridgewater, in 1840. Speaking at the dedication of the 
first building for normal school purposes erected in the 
United States, at Bridgewater, in 1846, Mr. Mann revealed

the deep interest he felt in the establishment of normal 
schools, in the following words: 
I believe the Normal schools to be a new instrumentality in the 
advancement of the race. I believe that without them free schools 
themselves would be shorn of their strength and their healing 
power, and would at length become mere charity schools, and thus 
die out in fact and in form. Neither the art of printing, nor the 
trial by jury, nor a free press, nor free suffrage, can long exist to 
any beneficial and salutary purpose without schools for the training 
of teachers; for if the character and qualifications of teachers be 
allowed to degenerate, the free schools will become pauper schools, 
and the pauper schools will produce pauper souls, and the free 
press will become a false and licentious press, and ignorant voters 
will become venal voters, and through the medium and guise of 
republican forms an oligarchy of profligate and flagitious men will 
govern the land; nay, the universal diffusion and ultimate triumph 
of all-glorious Christianity itself must await the time when know- 
ledge shall be diffused among men through the instrumentality of 
good schools. Coiled up in this institution, as in a spring, there is 
a vigor whose uncoiling may wheel the spheres. 
Further development and change in character. The 
States which established normal schools, before 1860, and 
their order of establishment were: 
1839. Massachusetts (1st). 1854. Massachusetts (4th). 
1839. Massachusetts (2d). 1854. Rhode Island. 
1840. Massachusetts (8d). 1855. New Jersey. 
1844. New York. 1857. Mlinois. 
1849. Connecticut. 1859. Pennsylvania. 
1849. Michigan. 1860. Minnesota. 
The year 1860 thus found the United States with twelve 
state normal schools, in nine States (see map, p. 242), and 
six private schools organized for the same purpose. By 1865 
the number had increased to twenty state schools, and there- 
after, for reasons which we will next describe, the develop- 
ment of both public and private normal schools was rapid. 
Their development, compared with the growth of the United 
States, is shown in the figure on the following page. Teacher- 
 
-P-A-G-E-328

training also changed markedly in character, after about 
1860, with the rise of a new methodology of instruction, 
which we shall next describe.

Early beginnings. Up to about 1860 there had been no 
general adoption in the United States of Pestalozzian ideas 
as to instruction, aside from primary arithmetic, though 
much had been written on his work in Switzerland, and the 
various Reports by American travelers abroad had extolled 
the Pestalozzian-Prussian elementary-school instruction. 
The introduction of Infant Schools, after 1818, had done 
something to bring about a more rational conception as to 
the educational process (p. 100), particularly as to teaching 
reading and numbers, and the publication of Warren Col- 
burn’s First Lessons in Arithmetic on the Plan of Pesta- 
lozzi, in 1821, had gradually substituted mental arithmetic 
for ciphering sums in the lower grades of our schools. The 
new educational journals (p. 260) and many magazine
-P-A-G-E-329
  ELEMENTARY EDUCATION REORGANIZED 295 
articles had also done much to familiarize schoolmen with 
the ideas and practices of the Swiss reformer. 
\As early as 1839 Henry Barnard had distributed among 
the teachers of Connecticut a pamphlet on Pestalozzi, and 
in 1847 and 1849 he distributed two other pamphlets on his 
work and method of instruction. In Massachusetts, Pesta- 
lozzian methods were introduced into a few private schools, 
and in 1848 object teaching was introduced into the state 
normal school at Westfield. From 1848 to 1854 Arnold 
Guyot, a Swiss, was an Agent of the Massachusetts State 
Board of Education and State Institute Lecturer on the 
teaching of home and observational geography, and after 
1852 Hermann Kriisi, Jr., a son of one of Pestalozzi’s teach- 
ers, held a similar position for drawing and arithmetic. } Still, 
notwithstanding these promising beginnings, the work re- 
mained local and exerted no real influence on school prac- 
tice elsewhere, and up to about 1860 it may be said that 
Pestalozzian ideas, though adopted here and there, had as 
yet made no deep impression in the United States. 
“The Oswego Movement marks the real introduction. The 
real introduction of Pestalozzian ideas and methods is due 
to the energy and initiative of Edward A. Sheldon, of Os- 
wego, New York, and so thoroughly did he do the work 
that in a few years every one was talking in terms of Pesta- 
lozzian procedure, and the ideas and methods he introduced 
had spread all over the country. 
Mr. Sheldon began, much as had Pestalozzi himself, by 
establishing, in 1848, a school in Oswego for poor and neg- 
lected children. Following English terminology it was called 
a “ragged school,” and was composed of “120 rude and 
untrained Irish boys and girls between the ages of 5 and 
21.” In 1851 Mr. Sheldon was elected superintendent of 
the schools of Syracuse, but in 1853 was recalled to Oswego 
to become its first superintendent. Himself a careful stu- 
dent, familiar with the pedagogical literature of the day, he 
soon eliminated much of the textbook memorizing and began 
to give his teachers training in teaching by better methods. 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
  296 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Somewhere about 1860 Mr. Sheldon saw, in the museum 
at Toronto, Canada, a full set of the models, objects, method- 
materials, and publications of the English Home and Colo- 
nial Infant Society, which, it will be remembered (p. 270), 
had adopted the formal type of Pestalozzian work intro- 
duced into England by the Mayos. His interest now fully 
awakened, he set about reshaping the training of his teach- 
ers after the plans of the English Society. The necessary 
books and apparatus were imported from England, in 1860, 
and the next year the Board of Education of Oswego digni- 
fied the work he was doing by creating a city normal school 
to train teachers in the new methods for the schools of the 
city. The Board also (1861) obtained permission for Miss 
Margaret E. M. Jones, a teacher in the English Training 
College of the Society, to come to Oswego and establish the 
work. On her return to England in 1862, Hermann Kriisi, 
Jr., who had taught in the Home and Colonial Infant Soci- 
ety Training College in England for five years, and who had 
been in the United States for ten years, teaching in a private 
school and acting as institute lecturer on drawing and arith- 
metic for the Massachusetts Board of Education, was se- 
cured to continue the training Miss Jones had started. 
The English formalized Pestalozzian methods were soon 
firmly established in the Oswego schools, and so well was 
the work there advertised, and so important did the move- 
ment become, that it for a time completely overshadowed 
the Swiss and German type of Pestalozzian instruction 
which had been introduced into Massachusetts, and here 
and there into schools in other States. In 1862 a com- 
mittee of prominent educators accepted an invitation to 
visit and examine the Oswego schools, and they made a favor- 
able report on the work. In 1863 Mr. Sheldon explained his 
work before the National Teachers’ Association. ’ After this, 
“object teaching” held a place of first importance on the 
program of this and other teachers’ associations for at least 
a decade. In 1864 the National Teachers’ Association ap- 
pointed a committee to investigate the system, and this

‘committee reported favorably the following year. In 1863 
the State of New York granted $3000 a year aid to the 
Oswego school, and in 1866 took it over as a State Normal 
School. 
Visitors now came in numbers to see the new work, “oral 
instruction”’ and “object teaching” became the great new 
ideas in education, and Oswego teachers were sought by city 
school systems and new normal schools all over the northern 
part of the United States. or a decade and a half Oswego 
was distinctively the training school for normal school in- 
structors and city school supervisors, and the “striking per- 
sonalities” which Mr. Sheldon gathered and held together 
for years, and the enthusiasm for the new work which his 
teachers imparted to others, gave his school a deserved na- 
tional reputation, As a recent writer has well said, “he 
shaped a coherent course of study and turned out a large 
group of teachers who thought teaching, on Oswego lines, 
the greates thing in the world.” What the so-called 
“Oswego(Movement” in our educational history really

ates objective teaching. In the first place it meant 
‘awery great change in the character of the teaching process 
itself. As we have seen, colonial and early national edu- 
cation was characterized by individual reciting. The pupil 
did his work at his seat, and the teacher heard him read or 
looked over his work or the sums on his slate or paper. The 
next advance step was to class organization, which we traced 
in Chapter VIII, but the teacher or the assistant teacher 
still heard recitations from subject matter which the chil- 
dren had learned, that is memorized, from a book. Many 
of the early geographies and histories had even been con- 
structed on the plan of the older Catechism, that is on a 
question and answer basis. The System of Geography by 
Nathaniel Dwight, an early and a very popular book, illus- 
trates the plan. It was a volume of 215 pages, beginning 
with Europe and ending with America, and all of the Cate-

chism type. The following, relating to France, is illustra- 
tive: 
Q. What is the situation and extent of France? 
A. It is situated between 42 and 51 degrees of north latitude, 
and between 5 degrees west and 8 degrees of east longitude. 
It is 600 miles long and 500 broad. 
Q. How is France bounded?

on the north; by Germany, Switzerland, and Italy on the 
east; by the Mediterranean and the Pyrenean Mountains, 
south; and by the Bay of Biscay, west.

. Into 21 provinces formerly, and lately into 83 departments. 
. From what is the name France derived? 
. It is derived from a German word signifying free men. >

There was nothing for the child to do but memorize such 
subject-matter, or for the teacher but to see that the pupils 
knew the answers to the questions. Up to the middle of the 
nineteenth century, at least, and much later in most schools, 
the dominant characteristic of instruction was the recita- 
tion, in which the pupils merely recited what had been 
learned from their textbooks. It was school-keeping, not 
teaching, that teachers were engaged in. 
(The Pestalozzian form of instruction, based on sense-per- 
ception, reasoning, and individual judgment, called for a 
complete change in classroom procedure. What Pesta- 
lozzi tried most of all to do was to get children to use their 
senses and their minds, to look carefully, to count, to ob- 
serve forms, to get, by means of their five important senses, 
clear impressions and ideas as to objects and life in the world 
about them, and then to think over what they had seen 
and be able to answer his questions, because they had ob- 
served carefully and reasoned clearly. Pestalozzi thus 
clearly subordinated the printed book to the use of the 
child’s senses, and the repetition of mere words to clear 
ideas about things. Pestalozzi thus became one of the first 
teal teachers. /
-P-A-G-E-333
   ELEMENTARY EDUCATION REORGANIZED 299 
This was an entirely new process, and for the first time in 
history a real “technique of instruction” was now called for. 
Dependence on the words of the text could no longer be relied 
upon. The oral instruction of a class group, using real ob- 
jects, called for teaching skill. The class must be kept nat- 
urally interested and under control, the essential elements to 
be taught must be kept clearly in the mind of the teacher, the 
teacher must raise the right kind of questions, in the right 
order, to carry the class thinking along to the right conclu- 
sions, and, since so much of this type of instruction was not 
down in books, it called for a much more extended knowl- 
edge of the subject on the part of the teacher than the old 
type of school-keeping had done. The teacher must now 
both know and be able to organize and direct. Class lessons 
must be thought out in advance, and teacher-preparation in 
itself meant a great change in teaching procedure. Eman- 
cipated from dependence on the words of a text, and able 
to stand before a class full of a subject and able to question 
freely, teachers became conscious of a new strength and a 
professional skill unknown in the days of textbook reciting. 
It is not to be wondered that the teachers leaving Oswego 
went out feeling that teaching, by the Oswego methods, was 
the greatest thing in the world. 
Language instruction. From such teaching oral language 
lessons, once so rare and now so common, naturally followed 
as a matter of course. Pupils trained to observe and think 
naturally come to be able to express. Boys and girls who 
are full of a subject have little difficulty in telling what 
they have seen or know. Free exercise in oral expression — 
oral language work — thus entered the school. Pestalozzi 
made it one of the great features of his teaching. Stowe and 
Mann had called attention to it as an important element of 
the instruction in the Prussian people’s school. Some start 
had been made in introducing such instruction into the 
schools of Massachusetts, but it was left to Oswego to de- 
monstrate clearly the importance of oral language in the 
instruction of children. Oral language work thus came in
-P-A-G-E-334
  300 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
as a new subject for instruction in the primary grades, and, 
to a degree, oral and written language work tended to re- 
place the former great emphasis on English grammar in the 
upper grades of the elementary school. 
From oral language work, once made a feature of instruc- 
tion, the teaching of correct speech-usage came naturally 
to the front, and usage, rather than learning the rules of 
grammar, came to be depended upon as the chief means for 
teaching English. Virtually a new subject of instruction 
was thus added to the elementary-school course as a result 
of the oral and objective teaching introduced into our 
schools between 1860 and 1875. 
Object teaching leads to elementary science. Another 
new and most valuable subject of instruction also came in 
now as an outgrowth of oral and objective teaching, and 
this was the study of nature. The first step in the process 
was the object-lesson idea, popularized in England after 
1880 by Miss Mayo’s book, and in this country after 1860 
by the work at Oswego. Thousands of lessons were written 
out on all forms of natural objects, many far too technical 
and too scientific to be of much interest or value to children, 
and these were taught by the teachers. 
Under the influence of William T. Harris, who became 
superintendent of schools in St. Louis in 1868, an important 
change was made from the scattered object lessons on all 
sorts of scientific subjects to a much more logically organized 
study of the different sciences. He published, in 1871, an 
extremely well-organized course of study for the orderly 
study of the different sciences, and one thoroughly charac- 
teristic of his logical, metaphysical mind. Due in part to 
his high standing as a school superintendent, and in part to 
his course of study being a marked improvement over the 
English-Oswego object-lesson work, this type of course of 
study was widely copied, became very popular in our schools 
for the next generation, and did much to introduce science 
instruction into our schools. Oral lessons in physiology 
were also introduced into all the grades, and this subject,

mportance, soon tended to separate itself off as a 
"xt step, and a relatively recent one, was the develop- 
‘the modern nature-study idea. By this is meant, 
flower grades at least, “‘a simple observational study 
amon natural objects and processes for the sake of 
_sonal acquaintance with the things which appeal to hu- 
man interest directly, and independently of relations to or- 
ganized science,” and to include object lessons, observation, 
picnics, stories told and read, awakening a love of nature, 
and finally a more serious study of selected simple phases of 
agriculture, geology, and the physical and biological sciences. 
Thus, by a process of evolution, we have obtained another 
new and very important study — two, if we count physi- 
ology and the more recent development of health instruc- 
tion as a separate subject —as an outgrowth of the objec- 
tive and oral instruction which goes back in its origin to 
Pestalozzi and the Emile of Rousseau. 
Instruction in geography revolutionized. Oral and ob- 
jective teaching also led to great changes in the character 
of instruction in geography. The old geography was fact- 
geography — astronomical, physical, natural, and political 
—and some of the earlier, briefer compends, as we have 
pointed out, were of the question and answer type. The 
early work by Morse fixed the type of text and the nature 
of the instruction. Definitions, all kinds of political and 
statistical data, boundaries, capitals, products, exports and 
imports, and similar more or less useless information, filled 
the texts. This was learned and recited by the pupils, and 
the teacher’s task was to see that it was memorized. Such 
geography has been called ship-captain or mail-clerk geo- 
graphy. 
Objective and oral teaching, applied to geography, wrought 
a vast change in the character of the instruction. ( Following 
Rousseau’s idea of “back-to-nature”’ and Pestalozzi’s plans 
for instruction, the new study of home geography was de- 
veloped, and from the immediate surroundings geographical =

instruction was extended to the region thereabou 
called for observation out-of-doors, the study of type 
and the substitution of the physical and human aspe 
geography for the political and statistical. The Gern. 
Carl Ritter, developed this new type of geography, betwe 
1817 and 1859, and especially home geography after the ide 
of Pestalozzi. 
In 1848 the Massachusetts State Board of Education 
brought to this country a Swiss by the name of Arnold 
Guyot, who had been a pupil under Ritter, and who for the 
next six years was an institute lecturer and state inspector 
for Massachusetts, and later did similar work in New Jersey. 
He addressed thousands of teachers on the needed reforms 
and proper methods, and later, through his beautifully illus- 
trated textbooks and a detailed method-guide for teachers, 
all published about 1866, tended to fix the new type of ‘in- 
struction among the more progressive teachers of the time. 
An Oswego teacher helped him prepare his books, the aims 
of which he stated to be “‘to fill the young with vivid pic- 
tures of nature in such regions of the globe as may be 
considered great geographical types.”’ The work of Colonel 
Francis W. Parker in training teachers, his How to Teach 
Geography (1889), and the textbooks by Frye (1895), con- 
tinued the work of Guyot, improving on it and bringing 
geographical teaching down to its modern form. We thus 
have a direct line of descent from Rousseau through Pesta- 
lozzi, Ritter, Guyot, Parker, and Frye to modern practices. 
Mental arithmetic. (Before Pestalozzi, arithmetic had 
meant ciphering, and either commercial counting or the 
solution of complicated problems. Pestalozzi. replaced 
ciphering with simple and rapid mental calculations. Count- 
ing beans, boys, sticks, lines, mountain peaks, and holes in 
the lace curtains or spots on the wall-paper of the castle, 
formed the basis for his arithmetic... The number chart 
shown here was for long a prominent feature in all Pesta- 
lozzian schools, the purpose being to keep before the pupil’s 
perception the number combinations from one to ten. (Con-

crete number ideas, and not words about numbers, were 
what Pestalozzi was trying to teach. He held that the 
mental processes of the pupil were the most important part 
of arithmetical study, and that the quickness, accuracy, 
judging, and reasoning developed by such work was of prime

importance in the education of children. \ (He accordingly 
discarded sand-tables, paper, and slates for ciphering, and 
trained the pupils to solve mentally rather complicated 
problems with whole numbers and fractions.) Visitors to 
his school were astonished at the skill displayed by the 
children in the use of the four fundamental operations in 
arithmetic. Mental arithmetic, being a very practical sub- 
ject, Pestalozzian ideas and plans were soon adopted gen- 
erally in the schools of Switzerland, Holland, the German 
States, and England. After the close of Pestalozzi’s school 
in Switzerland, in 1825, Reiner, who had taught arithmetic 
there, went to England and became a teacher in the Train- 
ing College of the Home and Colonial Infant Society. 
(Pestalozzian mental arithmetic was the first of the new 
subjects to reach us, coming through Warren Colburn’s First  
-P-A-G-E-340
  304 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Lessons in Arithmetic on the Plan of Pestalozzi, published 
in Boston, in 1821. The publication of this book marked 
our first adoption of Pestalozzian ideas in teaching, and was 
the only phase of Pestalozzianism to be widely adopted be- 
fore 1860. The book contained a multitude of simple prob- 
lems, to be solved mentally, and many of these were stated 
in particularly attractive form. The following extracts are 
illustrative: 
How many hands have a boy and a clock? 
Four rivers ran through the Garden of Eden, and one through 
Babylon; how many more ran through Eden than Babylon? 
Judas, one of the twelve Apostles, hung himself; how many were 
left? 
Miss Fanny Woodbury was born in 1791, and died in 1814; Miss 
Hannah Adams lived to be 53 years older; how old was Han- 
nah Adams? 
At $2.50 a yard, what will 23 yards of cloth cost? 
This book must be ranked with Webster’s Seller as one 
of the greatest American textbooks. Mental arithmetic, by 
1850, had become one of the most important subjects of the 
school, and everywhere Colburn’s book was in use. The 
sale of the book was enormous, and its influence great. Like 
all successful textbooks, it set a new standard and had many 
imitators. One of these, Barnard’s A Treatise on Arith- 
metic, published at Hartford, in 1830, was the first American 
arithmetic to contain any pictures to aid beginners in mas- 
tering the subject. The following is an illustration from 
this book.

Grube, tried to improve on the teaching of arithmetic thus

developed by applying to it another Pestalozzian principle, 
namely, that of reducing each subject to its elements, and 
then making a thorough study of each element before pro- 
ceeding to the next. His idea had all the characteristics of 
logical German thoroughness, carried to a typical German 
extreme. Fortunately the method was not exploited in this 
country until 1870, when it was explained in a paper by 
Louis Soldan, then a teacher in St. Louis, a school system 
then under the leadership of Dr. Harris and at the front 
in all movements intended to improve instruction. The 
paper was republished in many States, from New England 
to California, and soon marked out a new line for the teach- 
ing of primary arithmetic. By 1885 even the rural schools 
of the United States had adopted the Grube idea, and it is 
only since about 1900 that we have turned back once more 
to the better ideas of Pestalozzian teaching as represented 
in Colburn’s book and its modern successors. 
The essential idea of Grube’s method was intense thor- 
oughness in teaching every element. The number oné was 
taught for days before going to number two, and two in all 
possible and imaginary combinations before taking up three, 
and so on. The entire first year was devoted to teaching 
the numbers one to ten, and the second year the numbers 
to one hundred. The method was extremely absurd, and 
so clearly away from the better teaching of of Colburn that 
one wonders how American teachers came to take up so 
completely the Grube idea. 
Writing, drawing, and music. Grube’s work in organ- 
izing a subject so as to proceed by carefully graded stages 
from the simplest element to the more and more complex 
illustrated another Pestalozzian idea, viz., that the teaching 
process could eventually be so “mechanized’’ that there 
would be a regular A, B, C, for each type of instruction, 
which, once learned, would give perfection to a teacher. 
This idea Pestalozzi strove, unsuccessfully, to work out. 
In reading it led to the alphabet-syllable-word — A, B, C, 
ba, ca, ra; bat, cat, rat — method of teaching, long retained

by us, but early discarded by the Germans for the word 
method, and now replaced in this country by a combined 
word and sound method for teaching beginners to read. In 
arithmetic the idea led eventually to the absurd Grube 
method. In object lessons it led to a detailed study and

analysis of properties and characteristics, and to an absurd 
— for children — scientific classification of objects. 
When applied to the new subjects of writing, drawing, and 
music, which really came in as elementary school subjects 
after about 1845 in Massachusetts, and more generally only 
with the Oswego work after 1860, we get this Pestalozzian

ELEMENTARY EDUCATION REORGANIZED 307 
principle in its extreme form. For a generation the teach- 
ing of these newer subjects was formal, mechanical, lifeless, 
and largely ineffective because of the attempt to present the 
subjects logically to children, and to analyze each subject 
into its elements. Before children began really to write they 
were drilled on lines and curves and angles and movements 
until they were thoroughly tired of writing as.a-subject-be- 
cause it led to so little writing. In drawing, year after year 
was spent in studying form, with scientific instruction as to 
angles and geometrical figures and perspective, but without 
reaching color and expression. In music, similarly, much 
drill was put on tone studies, scales, and reading notes, but 
without much real singing. For a generation these methods 
of teaching these special subjects, largely brought over from 
England at the beginnings of the Oswego Movement, were 
the ruling methods. Since about 1900 they had been gen- 
erally abandoned for the far simpler and easier procedure 
which leads earlier and more directly to actual writing and 
drawing and singing, and to a childish appreciation of the 
value of these special arts. ‘The new methods are far less 
logical than the earlier plans, but we have long since learned 
from a study of the psychology of the learning process that 
children do not think along the same logical lines as adults. 
History not developed until later. History as a subject 
of study in our elementary schools came in largely as a by- 
product of the Civil War. Goodrich’s little history had ap- 
peared as early as 1822 (p. 219), and Noah Webster’s History 
of the United States in 1832. Before that time such history 
as had been taught had been brought in incidentally under 
geography and in reading. Vermont, in 1827, was probably | 
the first State to add history to the required list of elementary : 
school subjects. Massachusetts, the same year, added the | 
subject for the schools of the larger towns and the cities, but | 
did not include it for all until 1857. In most of the older | 
Northern States history was added to the list of required 
subjects shortly after the close of the Civil War, though 
many cities had added it to their course of study at an

earlier date. The purpose from the first was to emphasize 
American accomplishments, with the chief stress on the 
memorization of facts relating to our national heroes, wars, 
and political struggles. (The dominant purpose was the de... 
velopment of patriotism and an enthusiasm for the Union. 
Rousseau had declared history to be a subject of no im- 
portance for children, and{ Pestalozzi had done practically 
nothing with it Neither had the followers of Pestalozzi 
anywhere, so with the introduction of Pestalozzianism at 
Oswego and elsewhere, instruction in history was not in- 
cluded. It was added generally about this time, but, being 
unaffected by the new Pestalozzian ideas as to instruction, 
it began to be taught by the old memory methods of its ear- 
lier ancestor, geography. The reorganization of history in- 
struction did not come until near the end of the nineteenth 
century, under the inspiration of a new German influence, 
to be described in the next division of this chapter. The 
reorganization of reading, and the creation of a methodology 
for instruction in both history and literature, also date from 
the coming of this new influence. 
The normal school finds its place. The great change 
which took place in the character of elementary-school edu- 
cation between 1850 and 1880 will now be evident. The 
Civil War had checked material development. As a people 
we had neither the money nor the public interest necessary 
to expand the school system along material lines, or to add 
new types of schools. In organization our schools stood 
very much in 1880 as they had in 1850, the chief change be- 
ing that the lines marked out as to organization and grading 
and supervision by the better and more progressive city 
school systems by 1850 had, by 1880, been extended to even 
the smaller towns. Instead, the great educational develop- 
ment of these three decades was within. New subjects of 
study were introduced, the teaching of the older ones was 
revolutionized, and a technique, a methodology, for instruc- 
tion in each subject, except history and literature, was 
worked out. Where before the ability to organize and dis-
-P-A-G-E-345

cipline a school had constituted the chief art of instruction, 
now the ability to teach scientifically took its place as the 
prime professional requisite. A “science and art of teach- 
ing’ now arose, and the new subject of Pedagogy began to 
take form and secure recognition. 
The normal school now found its place, and Figure 54, 
showing its development, reveals how rapidly the movement 
to establish these schools gained headway after about 1865 
for public normal schools, and after about 1870 for the pri- 
vate tuition schools. The National Normal University, at 
Lebanon, Ohio; the Valparaiso Normal School, in Indiana; 
and the Northern Illinois Normal School, at Dixon, are types 
of dozens of such private low-tuition schools, which had thou- 
sands of students and were good money-makers for their 
owners. ‘These illustrate the great interest awakened by 
the work at Oswego and elsewhere in the effort to psycholo- 
gize the educational process and to reduce the teaching pro- 
cess to rule and method. 
Psychology becomes the master science. The new con- 
ception of the child as a slowly developing personality, de- 
manding subject-matter and method 'suited to his stage of 
development, and the new conception of teaching as that 
of directing education instead of hearing recitations and 
“keeping school,” now replaced the earlier knowledge-con- 
ception of school work. Psychology soon became the 
guiding science of the school, and, imparting to would-be 
teachers the methodology of instruction in the different 
subjects, the great work of the normal school. A little later, 
in the early nineties, the natural successor of this movement 
— child study — made its appearance, and for a time almost 
monopolized the educational field. It was now sought to 
ascertain much more fully how and in what ways childish 
personality developed. Children were observed and ques- 
tioned and tabulated for all sorts of traits, opinions, and 
information; the “questionnaire’”’ was used by the child- 
study enthusiasts to gather all kinds of data, and much 
useful as well as much worthless information was gathered

as to child nature and ideas. Though carried on in all parts 
of the United States, the work of G. Stanley Hall and his 
students, at Clark University, formed the leading center of 
the movement. 
The new normal-trained woman teacher now began to be 
markedly in evidence and, after 1880, the displacement of 
men teachers was rapid in all parts of the country. This 
new teacher brought with her to the school a new concep-

tion of childhood, a new and a minute methodology, and 
a new enthusiasm, all of which were valuable additions, 
though for a time often carried to a ridiculous extreme. 
Problems had to be analyzed just so, pupils must answer 
just so, and thinking must proceed in approved order and 
be stated in proper form. Each problem to be solved must 
first be analyzed in correct English into a correct statement, 
short-cut though correct replies were not allowed, while such 
errors as the multiplication of children by dimes or the di- 
vision of dollars by horses were almost unpardonable. The
-P-A-G-E-347

spirit of instruction was often lost in a too strict euadiniee 
of the form. These defects and excesses, almost always the 
accompaniment of any new movement which strongly in- 
fluences the course of educational development, in time 
largely disappeared, and both methodology and child study 
fell into their proper places as parts, but not the whole, of 
the science of education. 
III. New Ipras rrom Herpartian SOURCES 
Where Pestalozzi left the educational problem. Pesta- 
lozzi had done a wonderful work in reorganizing and redirect- 
ing the education of children, but after all his work had been 
based wholly on observation and experimentation, and with- 
out attempting to measure it up with any guiding scientific 
principle. His unwearied patience, his intense personal suf- 
ferings, and his self-sacrifice for childhood were wonderful. 
The story of his life forms one of the most touching chapters 
in the history of education, and his sufferings and successes 
gave reality to his statement that after all “the essential 
principle of education is not teaching; it is love.’’ His elabo- 
ration of the thought of Rousseau that education was an 
individual development, a drawing out and not a pouring 
in; that the basis of all education exists in the nature 
of man; and that the method of education is to be sought 
and not constructed, were his great contributions. These 
ideas led him to emphasize sense perception and expression; 
to formulate the rule that in teaching we must proceed from 
the simple to the complex, and from the concrete to the ab- 
stract; and to construct a “faculty psychology” which con- 
ceived of education as “a harmonious development”’ of the 
different “faculties” of the mind. It was at this point that 
Pestalozzi left the problem, and in this form that we re- 
ceived it by way of England in the sixties. 
The work of Herbart. Taking up the ie as Pesta- 
lozzi left it, a German by the name of Johann Friedrich Her- 
bart (1776-1841) carried it forward by organizing a truer 
psychology for the whole educational process, by erecting a 
   
-P-A-G-E-348

312 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
new aim in instruction, by formulating new steps in method, 
and by showing the place and the importance of properly 
organized instruction in history and literature in the educa- 
tion of the child. Though the two men were entirely differ- 
ent in type, and worked along entirely different lines, the 
connection between Herbart and Pestalozzi was, neverthe- 
less, close. Herbart had visited Pestalozzi at Burgdorf, in 
1799, just after graduating from Jena and while acting as a 
tutor for three Swiss boys, and had written a very sympa- 
thetic description of his school and his theory of instruction. 
Herbart was one of the first of the Germans to understand 
and appreciate “the genial and noble Pestalozzi.” 
The two men, however, approached the educational prob- 
lem from entirely different angles. Pestalozzi gave nearly 
all his long life to teaching and human service, while Her- 
bart taught only as a traveling private tutor for three 
years, and later a class of twenty children in his university 
practice school. Pestalozzi was a social reformer, a vision- 
ary, and an impractical enthusiast, but was possessed of 
a remarkable intuitive insight into child nature. Herbart, 
on the other hand, was a well-trained scholarly thinker, who 
spent the most of his life in the peaceful occupation of a pro- 
fessor of philosophy in a German university. The son of a 
well-educated public official, Herbart was himself educated 
at the Gymnasium of Oldenburg and the University of Jena. 
After spending three years as a tutor, he became, at the age 
of twenty-six, an under teacher at the University of Got- 
tingen. At the age of thirty-three he was called to become 
professor of philosophy at Kénigsburg, and from the age of 
fifty-seven to his death at sixty-five he was again a professor 
at Gottingen. It was while at Kénigsburg, between 1810 
and 1832, and as an appendix to his work as professor of 
philosophy, that he organized a small practice school, con- 
ducted a Pedagogical Seminar, and worked out his educa- 
tional theory and method. His work was a careful, scholarly 
attempt at the organization of education as a science, carried 
out amid the peace and quiet which a university atmosphere
-P-A-G-E-349
ELEMENTARY EDUCATION REORGANIZED 313 
almost alone affords, He addressed himself chiefly to three 
things: (1) the aim, (2) the content, and (3) the method of 
instruction. 
The aim and the content of education. Locke had set up 
as the aim of education the ideal of a physically sound gen- 
tleman. Rousseau had declared his aim to be to prepare 
his boy for life by developing naturally his inborn capacities. 
Pestalozzi had sought to regenerate society by means of 
education, and to prepare children for society by a “har-_ 
monious training” of their “faculties.” Herbart rejected 
alike the conventional-social education of Locke, the natural 
and unsocial education of Rousseau, and the “faculty- 
psychology” conception of education of Pestalozzi. In- 
stead he conceived of the mind as a unity, rather than di- 
vided into “faculties,” and the aim of education as broadly 
social rather than personal. The purpose of education, he 
said, was to prepare men to live properly in organized so- 
ciety, and hence the chief aim in education was not con- 
ventional fitness, natural development, mere knowledge, nor 
personal mental power, but personal character and social 
morality. This being the case, the educator should analyze 
the interests and occupations and social responsibilities of 
men as they are grouped in organized society, and, from such 
analyses, deduce the means and the method of instruction. 
Man’s interests, he said, come from two main sources — his 
contact with the things in his environment (real things, 
sense-impressions), and from his relations with human be- 
ings (social intercourse). His social: ‘responsibilities and 
duties are determined by the nature of the social organiza- 
tion of which he forms a part. 
Pestalozzi had provided fairly well for the first group of 
contacts, through his instruction in objects, home geography, 
numbers, and geometric form. For the second group of con- 
tacts Pestalozzi had developed only oral language, and to 
this Herbart now added the two important studies of liter- 
ature and history, and history with the emphasis on the 
social rather than the political side. Two new elementary 
   
-P-A-G-E-350
  814 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
school subjects were thus developed, each important iin re- 
vealing to man his place in the social whole. History ffi 
particular Herbart conceived to be a study of the first im- 
portance for revealing proper human relationships, and 
leading men to social and national “good-will.” 
The chief purpose of education Herbart held to be to de- 
velop personal character and to prepare for social usefulness. 
These virtues, he held, proceeded from enough of the right" 
kind of knowledge, properly interpreted to the pupil so that 
clear ideas as to relationships might be formed. To impart 
this knowledge interest must be awakened, and to arouse 
interest in the many kinds of knowledge needed, a “ many- 
sided” development must take place. From full know- 
ledge, and with proper instruction by the teacher, clear 
ideas or concepts might be formed, and clear ideas ought to 
lead to right action, and right action to personal character 
— the aim of all instruction. Herbart was the first writer 
on education to place the great emphasis on proper instruc- 
tion, and to exalt teaching and proper teaching-procedure 
instead of mere knowledge or intellectual discipline. He 
thus conceived of the educational process as a science in 
itself, having a definite content and method, and worthy of 
special study by those who desire to teach. 
Herbartian method. With these ideas as to the aim and 
content of instruction, Herbart worked out a theory of the 
instructional process and a method of instruction. Interest 
he held to be of first importance as a prerequisite to good” 
instruction. If given spontaneously, well and good; but, 
if necessary, forced interest must be resorted to. Skill in 
instruction is in part to be determined by the ability of the 
teacher to secure interest without resorting to force on the 
one hand or sugar-coating of the subject on the other. 
Taking Pestalozzi’s idea that the purpose of the teacher was 
to give pupils new experiences_through contacts with real 
things, without assulaing that the pupils xkeady had such; Herbart elaborated the process by which new knowledge is 
assimilated in terms of what one already knows, and from,
-P-A-G-E-351
   ELEMENTARY EDUCATION REORGANIZED 316 
his elaboration of this principle the doctrine of apperception 
— that is, the apperceiving or comprehending of new knowl- 
edge in terms of the old — has been fixed as an important 
principle in educational psychology. Good instruction, 
then, involves first putting the child into a proper frame 
of mind to apperceive the new knowledge, and hence this 
becomes a corner stone of all good teaching method. 
Herbart did not always rely on such methods, holding 
that the “committing to memory” of certain necessary facts 
often was necessary, but he held that the mere memorizing 
of isolated facts, which had characterized school instruc- 
tion for ages, Had little value for either educational or moral 
ends. The teaching of mere facts often was very necessary, 
but such instruction called for a methodical organization of 
the facts by the teacher, so as to make their learning con- 
tribute to some definite purpose. This called for a purpose 
in instruction; the organization of the facts necessary to be 
taught so as to select the most useful ones; the connection 
of these so as to establish the principle which was the pur- 
pose of the instruction; and training in systematic think- 
ing by applying the principle to new problems of the type 
being studied. The carrying out of such ideas meant the 
careful organization of the teaching process and teaching 
method, to secure certain predetermined ends in child de- 
velopment, instead of mere miscellaneous memorizing and 
school-keeping. 
The Herbartian movement in Germany. Herbart died 
in 1841, without having awakened any general interest in 
his ideas, and they remained virtually unnoticed until 1865. 
In that year a professor at Leipzig, Tuiskon Ziller _(1817— 
1883), published a book setting forth Herbart’s idea of in- 
struction as a moral force. This attracted much attention, 
and led to the formation (1868) of a scientific society for 
the study of Herbart’s ideas. .Ziller and his followers now 
elaborated Herbart’s ideas, advanced the theory of culture- 
epochs in child development, the theory of concentration 
in studies, and elaborated the four steps in the process of  
-P-A-G-E-352
  316 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
instruction, as described by Herbart, into the five formal 
steps of the modern Herbartian school. 
In 1874 a pedagogical seminary and practice school was 
organized at the University of Jena, and in 1885 this came 
under the direction of Professor William Rein, a pupil of 
Ziller’s, who developed the practice school according to the 
ideas of Ziller. A detailed course of study for this school, 
filling two large volumes, was worked out, and the practice 
lessons given were thoroughly planned beforehand and the 
methods employed were subjected to a searching analysis 
after the lesson had been given. 
Herbartian ideas reach the United States. Between 1885 
and 1890 a number of Americans, many of them graduates 
of the state normal school at Normal, Illinois, studied in 
Jena, and returning brought back to the United States this 
Ziller-Rein-Jena brand of Herbartian ideas and practices. 
Charles De Garmo’s Essentials of Methods, published in 
1889, marked the beginning of the introduction of these 
ideas into this country. In 1892 Charles A. McMurry pub- 
lished his General Method, and in 1897, with his brother, 
Frank, published the Method in the Recitation. These three 
books probably have done more to popularize Herbartian 
ideas and introduce them into the normal schools and col- 
leges of the United States than all other influences com- 
bined. Another important influence was the “National 
Herbart Society,” founded in 1892 by students returning 
from Jena, in imitation of the similar German society. For 
the first few years of its existence its publications were de- 
voted to a discussion of interest, apperception, correlation, 
recitation methods, moral education, the culture-epoch 
theory, training for citizenship, the social function of history 
and geography, and similar subjects. This Society is still 
rendering good service under the name of the “National 
Society for the Study of Education,” though its earlier Her- 
bartian character now has disappeared. 
Herbartian ideas took like wildfire over the United States, 
but particularly in the normal schools of the Upper Missis-

sippi Valley. Methods of instruction in history and litera- 
ture, and a new psychology, were now added to the normal 
school professional instruction. New courses of study for 
the training schools were now worked out, in which the ele- 
mentary school subjects were divided into drill subjects, 
content subjects, and motor-activity subjects. Appercep- 
tion, correlation, social purpose, moral education, and reci- 
tation methods became new words to conjure with. From 
the normal schools these ideas spread rapidly to the better 
city school systems of the time, and soon found their way 
into courses of study everywhere. Practice schools and the 
model lessons in dozens of normal schools were remodeled 
after the pattern of those at Jena, and for a decade Herbar- 
tian ideas and child study vied with one another for the 
place of first importance in educational thinking. The Her- 
bartian wave of the nineties resembled the Pestalozzian 
enthusiasm of the sixties. Each for a time furnished the 
new ideas in education, each introduced elements of impor- 
tance into our elementary-school instruction, each deeply 
influenced the training of teachers in our normal schools by 
giving a new turn to the instruction there, and each gradu- 
ally settled down into its proper place in our educational 
practice and history. 
To the Herbartians we are indebted in particular for im- 
portant new conceptions as to the teaching of history.and 
literature, which have modified all our subsequent proce- 
dure; for the introduction of history teaching in some form 
into all the elementary-school grades; for the emphasis on a 
new social point of view in the teaching of history and geog- 
raphy; the emphasis on the moral aim in instruction; a new 
and a truer educational psychology; and a better organiza- 
tion of the technique of classroom instruction. With the 
introduction of normal child activities, which came from 
another source about this same time, our elementary school 
curriculum as we now have it was practically complete, and 
the elementary school of 1850 had been completely made 
over to form the elementary school of 1900,

IV. Tae Kinpercarten, Pray, anp Manvat Activities 
To another German, Friedrich Froebel, we are indebted, 
directly or indirectly, for three other additions to elemen- 
tary education — the kindergarten, the play idea, and hand- 
work activities. 
Origin of the kindergarten. Of German parentage, the 
son of a rural clergyman, early estranged from his parents, 
retiring and introspective by nature, having led a most un- 
happy childhood, and apprenticed to a forester without his 
wishes being consulted, at twenty-three Froebel decided to 
become a school teacher and visited Pestalozzi in Switzer- 
land. Two years later he became the tutor of three boys, 
and then spent the years 1808-10 as a student and teacher in 
Pestalozzi’s institute at Yverdon. During his years there 
Froebel was deeply impressed with the great value of music 
and play in the education of children, and of all that he car- 
ried away from Pestalozzi’s institution these ideas were most 
persistent. After serving in a variety of occupations — 
student, soldier against Napoleon, and curator in a museum 
of mineralogy — he finally opened a little private school, in 
1816, which he conducted for a decade along Pestalozzian 
lines. In this the play idea, music, and the self-activity of 
the pupils were uppermost. The school was a failure, finan- 
cially, but while conducting it Froebel thought out and 
published (1826) his most important pedagogical work — 
The Education of Man. 
Gradually Froebel became convinced that the most 
needed reform in education concerned the early years of 
childhood. His own youth had been most unhappy, and to 
this phase of education he now addressed himself. After a 
period as a teacher in Switzerland he returned to Germany 
and opened a school for little children in which plays, games, 
songs, and occupations involving self-activity were the 
dominating characteristics, and in 1840 he hit upon the name 
Kindergarten for it. In 1843 his Mutter- und Kose-Lieder, 
a book of fifty songs and games, was published.

Spread of the kindergarten idea. After a series of un- 
successful efforts to bring his new idea to the attention of 
educators, Froebel, himself a rather feminine type, became 
discouraged and resolved to address himself henceforth to 
women, as they seemed much more capable of understand- 
ing him, and to the training of teachers in the new ideas. 
Froebel was fortunate in securing as one of his most ardent 
disciples, just before his death, the Baroness Bertha von 
Marenholtz Biilow-Wendhausen (1810-93), who did more , 
than any other person to make his work known. Meeting, 
in 1849, the man mentioned to her as “an old fool,” she un- 
derstood him, and spent the remainder of her life in bringing 
to the attention of the world the work of this unworldly man 
who did not know how to make it known for himself. In 
1851 the Prussian Government, fearing some revolutionary 
designs in the new idea, forbade kindergartens in Prussia, so 
the Baroness went to London and lectured there on Froe- 
bel’s ideas, organizing kindergartens in the English “ragged 
schools.” She later expounded Froebelian ideas in Paris, 
Italy, Switzerland, Holland, Belgium, and (after 1860, when 
the prohibition was removed) in Germany. In 1870 she 
founded a kindergarten training college in Dresden. Many 
of her writings have been translated into English, and pub- 
lished in the United States. 
In this country the kindergarten idea has met with a cor- 
dial reception. The first kindergarten in the United States 
was a German kindergarten, established at Watertown, 
Wisconsin, in 1855, by Mrs. Carl Schurz, a pupil of Froebel. 
During the next fifteen years some ten other kindergartens 
were organized in German-speaking communities. The 
first English-speaking kindergarten was opened privately in 
Boston, in 1860, by Miss Elizabeth Peabody. In 1868 a 
private training school for kindergartners was opened in 
Boston, largely through Miss Peabody’s influence, by Ma- 
dame Matilde Kriege and her daughter, who had recently 
arrived from Germany. In 1872 Miss Marie Boelte opened 
a similar teacher-training school in New York City, and in

1873 her pupil, Miss Susan Blow, accepted the invitation 
of Superintendent William T. Harris, of St. Louis, to go there 
and open the first public school kindergarten in the United 
States. St. Louis, then perhaps the most prominent city 
school system in the country, soon became a center from 
which public kindergarten ideas were diffused. The first 
kindergarten in Chicago was opened in 1874, and by 1880 
some 300 kindergartens and 10 kindergarten training 
schools, mostly private undertakings, had been opened in 
the cities of thirty of the States of the Union. By 1890 
philanthropic kindergarten associations to provide and sup- 
port kindergartens had been organized in most of the larger 
cities, and after that date our city schools rapidly began to 
adopt the kindergarten as a part of the public school system, 
and thus add, at the bottom, one more rung to our educa- 
tional ladder. To-day there are approximately 9000 public 
and 1500 private kindergartens in the cities of the United 
States, and training in kindergarten principles and practices 
is now given by many of our state normal schools. 
The kindergarten idea. The dominant idea in the kin- 
dergarten is natural but directed self-activity, focused upon 
educational, social, and moral ends. Froebel believed in the 
continuity of a child’s life from infancy onward, and that 
self-activity, determined by the child’s interests and desires 
and intelligently directed, was essential to the unfolding of 
the child’s inborn capacities. He saw, more clearly than 
any one before him had done, the unutilized wealth of the 
child’s world, that the child’s chief characteristic is self-ac- 
tivity, the desirability of the child finding himself through 
play, and that the work of the school during these early years 
was to supplement the family by drawing out the child and 
awakening the ideal side of his nature. To these ends doing, 
self-activity, and expression became fundamental to the 
kindergarten, and movement, gesture, directed play, song, 
color, the story, and the human activities a part of kinder- 
garten technique. Nature study and school gardening were 
given a prominent place, and motor activity much called

into play. Advancing far beyond Pestalozzi’s principle of 
sense impressions, which, and as we have seen under object 
lessons, was largely passive learning, Froebel insisted on 
motor activity and learning by doing. 
Froebel, as well as Herbart, also saw the social i ane 
of education, and that man must realize himself not inde- 
pendently amid nature, as Rousseau had said, but as a 
social animal in codperation with his fellowmen. Hence he 
made his schoolroom a miniature of society, a place where 
courtesy and helpfulness and social codperation were promi- 
nent features. This social and at times reverent atmosphere 
of the kindergarten has always been a marked characteris- 
tic of its work. To bring out social ideas many dramatic 
games, such as shoemaker, carpenter, smith, and farmer, 
were devised and set to music. The “story” by the teacher 
was made prominent, and this was retold in language, acted, 
sung, and often worked out constructively in clay, blocks, or 
paper. Other games to develop skill were worked out, and 
use was made of sand, clay, paper, cardboard, and color. 
The “gifts” and “occupations” which Froebel devised were 
intended to develop constructive and esthetic power, and 
to provide for connection and development they were ar- 
ranged into an organized series of playthings. Individual 
development as its aim, motor expression as its method, and 
social codperation as its means were the characteristic ideas 
of this new school for little children. 
Since Froebel’s day we have learned much about children 
that was then unknown, especially as to the muscular and 
nervous organization and development of children, and 
with this new knowledge the tendency has been to enlarge 
the “gifts” and change their nature, to introduce new “occu- 
pations,” elaborate the kindergarten program of daily exer- 
cises, and to give the kindergarten more of an outrofs door 
character. 
The Montessori method. Another recent diva nie 
of the kindergarten idea, which a decade ago created quite 
a furore in many countries, is the scheme of child-training
-P-A-G-E-360
ee ey Eee ee ee ee ee ene nee ne 
$22 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
devised by Madame Maria Montessori, at Rome. Many 
Montessori schools have been opened in the United States, 
and the method has been heralded as a great improvement 
over the kindergarten. A more critical examination of her 
ideas has led, however, to their somewhat general rejection 
by most American educators, and it is probable that a decade 
hence Montessori schools will have largely disappeared as a 
school for normal-minded children. Based on an outgrown 
faculty psychology, a psychologically unsound plan for sense 
training, and involving a too early start in the formal arts of 
learning, the method has been generally decided to be dis- 
tinctly inferior to the modern Americanized kindergarten. 
Its best features have been drawn from the work of Seguin, 
Madame Montessori herself having been a teacher of de- 
fectives at Rome, and the method has its greatest value for 
subnormal children. 
The contribution of the kindergarten. Wholly aside from 
the specific training given children during the year, year 
and a half, or two years of training, the addition of the kin- 
dergarten to our American education has been a force of very 
large significance and usefulness. The idea that the child is 
primarily an active and not a learning animal has been given 
new emphasis, and that education comes chiefly by doing 
has been given new force. The idea that a child’s chief 
business is play, so different from our early Calvinistic 
conception, has been of large educational value. The elim- 
‘ination of book education and harsh discipline in the kin- 
dergarten has been an idea that has slowly but gradually 
extended upward into the lower grades of the elementary 
school. The play and game idea brought in by the kinder- 
garten has also been exceedingly useful in slowly changing 
the character of the physical training exercises of the upper 
grades and of the high school from the stiff Turnen and mili- 
tary type of bodily exercises, brought in by the Germans 
after their great migration to America began, to the free 
play and competitive games which we now have quite gen- 
erally developed.  
-P-A-G-E-361
   ELEMENTARY EDUCATION REORGANIZED 823 
To-day, largely as a result of the spreading of the kinder- 
garten spirit, we are coming to recognize play and games at 
something like their real social, moral, and educational 
values, wholly aside from their benefits as concern physical 
welfare, and to schedule play as a regular subject in our 
school programs. Music, too, has attained new emphasis 
since the coming of the kindergarten, and methods of teach- 
ing music more in harmony with kindergarten ideas have 
been introduced into the upper grades of our schools. 
Instruction in the manual activities. Froebel not only 
introduced constructive work — paper folding, weaving, 
needlework, and work with sand and clay and color — into 
the kindergarten, but he also proposed to extend and de- 
velop such work for the upper years of schooling in a school 
for hand training, which he outlined but did not establish. 
His proposed plan included the elements of the so-called 
manual-training idea, developed later, and he justified such 
instruction on the same educational grounds that we ad- 
vance to-day. It was not to teach a boy a trade, as Rous- 
seau had advocated, or to train children in sense-perception, 
as Pestalozzi had employed all his manual activities, but as 
a form of educational expression, and for the purpose of 
developing creative power within the child. The idea was 
advocated by a number of thinkers, about 1850 to 1860, 
but the movement finally took its rise in Finland, Sweden, 
and Russia. 
The first country to organize such work as a part of its 
school instruction was Finland, where, as early as 1858, 
Uno Cygnaeus (1810-88) outlined a course for manual 
training involving bench and metal work, wood-carving, and 
basket-weaving. In 1866 Finland made some form of man- 
ual work compulsory for boys in all its rural schools, and in 
its training colleges for male teachers. In 1872 the govern- 
ment of Sweden decided to introduce sloyd work into its 
schools, partly to counteract the bad physical and moral 
effects of city congestion, and partly to revivify the declin- 
ing home industries of the people. A sloyd school was es-
-P-A-G-E-362
324 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
tablished at Nis, in 1872, to train teachers, and in this a few 
of our early manual training teachers studied. In 1877 the 
work was added tothe Folk School instruction of Sweden. 
At first the old native sloyd occupations were followed, such 
as carpentering, turning, wood-carving, brush-making, book- 
binding, and work in copper and iron, but later the indus- 
trial element gave way to a well-organized course in edu- 
cational tool work for boys from twelve to fifteen years of 
age, after the Finnish plan. 
Manual training reaches the United States. The first 
introduction of the United States to this new form of instruc- 
tion came through the exhibit made by the Russian Govern- 
ment, at the Centennial Exhibition in 1876, of the work in 
wood and iron done by the pupils at the Imperial Technical 
School at St. Petersburg. This was a type of work espe- 
cially adapted to secondary school instruction. The St. 
Louis Manual Training High School, founded in 1880 in 
connection with Washington University, first gave expres- 
sion to this new form of education, and formed a type for 
the organization of such schools elsewhere. Privately sup- 
ported schools of this type were organized in Chicago, 
Toledo, Cincinnati, and Cleveland before 1886, and the first 
public manual-training high schools were established in Bal- 
timore in 1884, Philadelphia in 1885, and Omaha in 1886. 
The shopwork, based for long on the “Russian system,” in- 
cluded wood-turning, joinery, pattern-making, forging, 
foundry and machine work. The first high school to pro- 
vide sewing, cooking, dressmaking, and millinery for girls 
was the one at Toledo, established in 1886, though private 
classes had been organized earlier in a number of cities. 
This type of high school has developed rapidly with us, and 
to-day the tendency is strong to introduce such courses into 
all our high schools. 
The introduction of manual work into the elementary 
schools came a little later and a little more slowly, but now is 
very general. As early as 1880 the Workingmen’s School, 
founded by the Ethical Culture Society of New York, had
-P-A-G-E-363
  ELEMENTARY EDUCATION REORGANIZED 825 
provided a kindergarten and had extended the kindergarten 
constructive-work idea upward, in the form of simple wood- 
working, into its elementary school. In the public schools, 
experimental classes in elementary school woodworking were 
tried in one school in Boston, as early as 1882, the expense 
being borne by Mrs. Quincy A. Shaw. In 1888 the city took 
over these classes. In 1886 Mr. Gustav Larson was brought 
to Boston from Sweden to introduce Swedish sloyd, and a 
teacher-training school which has been very influential 
was established there 
in 1889. In 1876 Mas- 
sachusetts permitted 
cities to provide in- 
struction in sewing, 
and Springfield intro- 
duced such instruction 
in 1884, and element- 
ary school instruction 
in knifework in 1886. 
In 1882 Montclair, 
New Jersey, introduced 
manual training into 
its elementary schools, 
and in 1885 the State 
of New Jersey first’ 
offered state aid to in- 
duce the extension of 
the idea. In 1885 Phil- . A boy at Portland, Oregon, mending his shoe, instead adelphia added cook- of making a mortise-joint. 
  ing and sewing to its 
elementary schools, having done so in the girls’ high school 
five years earlier. In 1888 the City of New York added 
drawing, sewing, cooking, and woodworking to its element- 
ary school course of study. By 1890 approximately forty 
cities, nearly all of them in the North Atlantic group of 
States, had introduced work in manual training into their 
elementary schools, and from these beginnings the move-
-P-A-G-E-364
EL eT Tee ee ee ey eT Fe ee ena ee toe ee TS Soe 
826 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
ment has extended to practically all cities and to many 
towns and rural communities. 
From about 1885 to 1888 the manual-training idea was 
under heavy fire, the papers at the meeting of the Depart- 
ment of Superintendence of the National Education Asso- 
ciation, in 1887 and 1888, being a culmination of the discus- 
sion. The new work was then advocated on the grounds of 
formal discipline — that it trained the reasoning, exercised 
the powers of observation, and strengthened the will. The 
“exercises,” true to such a conception, were formal and uni- 
form for all. With the breakdown of the “faculty psy- 
chology,” and the abandonment in large part of the doctrine 
of formal discipline in the training of the mind, the whole 
manual-training work has had to be reshaped. As the writ- 
ings of Pestalozzi, Herbart, and Froebel were studied more 
closely, and with the new light on child development gained 
from child-study and the newer psychology, manual train- 
ing came to be conceived of in its proper light as a means of 
individual expression, and to be extended to new forms, 
materials, colors, and new practical and artistic ends. To- 
day the instruction in manual work in all its forms has been 
further changed to make it an educational instrument for 
interpreting the fields of art and industry in terms of their 
social significance and usefulness. 
The elementary school now reorganized and complete. 
Excepting instruction in agriculture, which came in recently 
as an outgrowth of nature study, and in response to an eco- 
nomic demand, the elementary course of study of 1900 con- 
tained all the elements of this course to-day. The changes 
and additions, and the variations in relative emphasis and 
in teachers’ methods in each subject, are shown in the chart 
opposite. It was a vastly changed course of study, though, 
from that of 1850, both as to content and methods. The 
beginning of these changes goes back to the work of Pesta- 
lozzi, though his contributions and those of Herbart, Froebel, 
and their disciples and followers are so interwoven in the 
educational practice of to-day that it is in most cases impos-

sible to trace them or separate them out one from the other. 
Our elementary school instruction of to-day remains, as be- 
fore, a sturdy native development, but deeply influenced, 
since 1860, by the best ideas of the great European theorists 
‘ and reformers. i 
In the great reorganization and redirection of elementary 
education, which took place between 1860 and 1900, prob- 
ably no American was more influential than Colonel Francis 
W. Parker (1837-1902). After some years in teaching, he 
spent the years 1872 to 1875 in study in Germany. On his 
return he was superintendent of schools at Quincy, Massa- 
chusetts, from 1875 to 1880, and from 1883 to 1899 was 
principal of the Cook County Normal School, at Chicago. 
It was he who introduced Germanized Pestalozzian-Ritter 
methods of teaching geography; he who strongly advocated 
the Herbartian plan for concentration of instruction about 
a central core, which he worked out for geography; he who 
insisted so strongly on the Froebelian principle of self-ex- 
pression as the best way to develop the thinking process; 
and he who saw educational problems so clearly from the 
standpoint of the child that he, and the pupils he trained, 
did much to bring about the reorganization in elementary 
education which had been worked out by 1900. Since that 
time the most influential constructive critic has been Pro- 
fessor John Dewey, to whom we shall refer a little later on.

    CHAPTER XI 
NEW MODIFYING FORCES 
Ws have now traced the evolution of the American pub- 
lic school from the beginnings of education at public expense 
down through the educational reorganization which took 
place within the school between 1860 and 1900, and have 
shown how the native American elementary school was 
modified and expanded and changed in character as the re- 
sult of new educational ideas which came to us from abroad. 
Since 1860, too, but. particularly since about 1885 to 1890, 
our schools have also been profoundly modified in character 
and changed in direction by forces other then educational, 
and to these we next turn. . In doing so we shall need to go 
back and pick up the beginnings of these new forces, trace 
briefly their development, and point out their far-reaching 
influence on our educational aims and procedure. The two 
great new forces to which we refer were foreign immigration 
and the industrial revolution. These two combined pro- 
duced vast social changes which in turn have necessitated 
important changes in our educational aims and practices. 
I. CHANGES IN THE CHARACTER OF OUR PEOPLE 
Our original stock. In previous chapters it has been 
shown that in all our early educational traditions and pro- 
cedure we were essentially English. The Dutch parochial 
school had been established in a few towns in New Amster- 
dam, but most of these had lapsed or been superseded by 
English schools after New Amsterdam passed to the control 
of the English. Some Lutheran Swedes had settled along 
the Delaware and established there their type of schools, 
but in time these were assimilated by the English around 
them and they, too, became English-speaking schools. Only
-P-A-G-E-371
  NEW MODIFYING FORCES 333 
in Pennsylvania was there any marked grouping of non- 
English-speaking peoples. We were in origin, and by the 
time of the American Revolution certainly had become, an 
English-type colony, speaking the English language, fol- 
lowing English customs and observances, adopting English 
law and English habits in morality and Sunday observances, 
and such schools 
as existed were, al- 
ways excepting the 
Germans of Penn- 
sylvania, almost en- 
tirely English-speak- 
ing schools. 
Some conception 
as to the character 
of our original pop- 
ulation may be ob- 
tained from the re- 
cords of the first Fed- 
eral Census, taken 
in 1790. It was not 
EY, then, as Fic. 60. Nationatity or THE Waite Poruta- 
it is now, to note jon, as sHowN BY THE Fammty NAMES IN 
down the country ru Census or 1790 
in which each per- 
son was born and the nationality of the parents, but an 
analysis has been made of the names of all persons appearing 
on the lists of this first census to determine their original 
nationality. The result is shown, for the white population, 
in the accompanying drawing. This shows that 83.5 per 
cent of the population possessed names indicating pure Eng- 
lish origin, and that 91.8 per cent had names which pointed 
to their having come from the British Isles. The next larg- 
est name-nationality was the German, with 5.6 per cent, and 
these were found chiefly in Pennsylvania, where they con- 
stituted 26.1 per cent of the total population. Next were 
those having Dutch names, who constituted 2 per cent of 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
, 
334 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
the whole population, and 16.1 per cent of the population of 
New York. No other nationality constituted over one half 
of one per cent of the total. The New England States then 
were almost as English as England itself, 93 to 96 per cent 
of the names being pure English, and 98.5 to 99.8 per cent 
being from the British Isles. 
The stream of immigrants begins. Up to 1820 the annual 
immigration into the United States was quite small, mostly 
English in character, and no records as to it were taken by 
the Government. In 1820, the first year for which records 
were kept, the number coming was only 8385, and it was 
not until 1825 that the number of immigrants reached fifty 
thousand, and not until 1842 that it reached one hundred 
thousand. Excepting only two years during our Civil War, 
the immigration to the United States, since 1845, has never 
been less than one hundred thousand. Between 1847 and 
1857 inclusive, the number coming was in no year less than 
two hundred thousand, and in 1854 the number was 427,833. 
Since 1903 the numbers have ranged from three quarters of 
a million to one and one quarter millions each year, and 
the total immigration from 1820 to 1914 has been 32,102,671. 
Compared with this vast movement of peoples to a new 
world the migrations of the Germanic tribes — Angles, 
Saxons, Jutes, Goths, Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Vandals, 
Sueves, Danes, Burgundians, Huns — into the old Roman 
Empire in the fourth and fifth centuries pale into insignifi- 
cance. Nosuch great movement of peoples was ever known 
before in history. 
Up to 1825 at least, the immigrants coming to the United 
States continued to be largely English, Scotch, and Protest- 
ant Irish, with a few Protestant Germans to the Eastern 
cities and to Pennsylvania. These fitted in easily with the 
existing population, and awakened but little notice and no 
fear. Between 1820 and 1840 both the German and the 
Trish immigration increased rapidly, and Irish Catholics from 
central and southern Ireland began to replace the north- 
ern Protestant Irish of the earlier migration. It was dur-  
-P-A-G-E-373
   NEW MODIFYING FORCES — 835 
ing the period from 1830 to 1850 that the Catholic parochial- 
school question first began to appear in cities of the North 
Atlantic group of States, and the controversy over the secu- 
larization of American education was brought to the front. 
The north and west of Europe migrations. The years 
1846-48 were years when the potato crop of Ireland was 
almost a complete failure, and, driven out by famine and 
by the oppressive system of landlordism which prevailed, 
great numbers of Irish immigrants came to the United 
States to finda new home. They settled chiefly in the cities 
of the North Atlantic group of States. Between 1845 and 
1855 a million and a quarter came, and. again, in 1882, fol- 
lowing another famine, Irish immigration reached another 
high point. In all, over four millions of Irish have come 
to us since 1820, and they still constitute ten per cent of all 
our foreign-born people. Unlike the other North and West 
of Europe peoples, Ireland had a high degree of illiteracy. 
The census of 1841 showed that fifty-three per cent of the 
people of Ireland over five years of age were unable to read 
and write. Less than one half of those who came in the 
early migration, and scarcely one quarter of those who came 
later, could read and write, and the coming of such large 
numbers of people, poor and uneducated, who would ulti- 
mately become citizens and voters, awakened a solicitude 
for our political future among the people of the northeastern 
part of the United States which materially aided in the es- 
tablishment there of public education and the development 
of state oversight and control. 
About this time the United States also began to receive 
large numbers of Germans. Up to 1830 the number of this 
nationality arriving had been negligible, as the government 
at home had been satisfactory. After 1835, however, with 
the growing narrowness of the German state governments, 
German immigration began a constant increase, and after 
the unsuccessful German revolutions of 1848 great numbers 
of liberty-loving Germans, chiefly from the South German 
States, left the Fatherland and came to this country. Dur-
-P-A-G-E-374
336 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
ing the decade from 1846 to 1855 over a million and a quar- 
ter came, settling in the cities of the eastern part of the 
United States and the cities and farming regions of the up- 
per Mississippi Valley. After the establishment of the Impe- 
rial German Government, in 1870, and the definite embarka- 
tion of this Government on an aggressive military policy, 
large numbers of Germans left the Empire and came to us, 
approximately two millions arriving between 1881 and 1895. 
In all, a total of about five and a quarter million Germans, 
the best and most liberty-loving of the German people, have 
come to this country since 1820. 
Unlike the Irish who came earlier, the Germans were a 
picked and a well-educated class, the earlier ones having 
left Germany largely because of political and religious op- 
pression, and the later ones largely to escape forced military 
service. The early Germans usually came in groups, formed 
settlements by themselves, held themselves aloof, and for 
a time constituted a segregated intellectual aristocracy 
among our people. They too awakened considerable alarm, 
as they, for a time, showed but little disposition to become a 
part of our national life. 
During the middle years of the nineteenth century large 
numbers of English came, in all a total of about three and a 
half millions having arrived since 1820. After 1840 Scan- 
dinavians, attracted by the free farms of the Northwest, also 
began to appear, though they did not reach the great period 
of their migration until the decade of the eighties. In all 
nearly two million Scandinavians have come to our shores. 
While these different peoples frequently settled in groups 
and for a time retained their foreign language, manners, and 
customs, they have not been particularly difficult to assimi- 
late. Of all these early immigrants the Germans have 
shown the greatest resistance to the assimilative process. 
All except the Irish came from countries which embraced 
the Protestant Reformation (see map, Fig. 1, page 7), where 
general education prevailed, and where progressive meth- 
ods in agriculture, trade, and manufacturing had begun to
-P-A-G-E-375
NEW MODIFYING FORCES $87 
supersede primitive methods. All were from rage stock 
not very different from our own, and all possessed courage, 
initiative, intelligence, adaptability, and self-reliance to a 
great degree. The willingness, good-nature, and executive 
qualities of the Irish; the intellectual thoroughness of the 
German; the respect for law and order of the English; and the 
thrift, sobriety, and industry of the Scandinavians have 
been good additions to our national life. 
Change in character of our immigration. After about 
1882 the character of our immigration changed in a very re- 
markable manner. 
Immigration from 
the North and West 
of Europe began 
to decline rather 
abruptly, and in its 
place immigration 
from the South and 
East of Europe set 
in. This soon de- 
veloped into a great 
stream. Practically 
no Italians came to 
us before 1870, but 
by 1890 they were 
coming at the rate 
of twenty thousand Fy. 61. ForEtcN-BorN In Tae Unrrep States 
a year, and during AS SHOWN BY THE CENSUS OF 1910 
the five-year period 
1906-10 as many as 1,186,100 arrived. After 1880, in 
addition, people from all parts of that medley of races 
which formerly constituted the Austro-Hungarian Empire 
— Poles, Bohemians, Moravians, Slovaks, Slovenes, Ruthe- 
nians, Dalmatians, Croatians, Bosnians, Magyars, and Aus- 
trians; Serbs, Bulgars, Roumanians, Montenegrins, and 
Albanians from the Balkans; Slavs, Poles, and Jews from 
Russia; and Japanese and Koreans from the Far East, be- 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
338 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
gan tocomein numbers. After 1900, Finns and Lithuanians 
from the North, driven out by Russian persecution; and 
Greeks, Syrians, Armenians, and Turks from the South, 
have come in shiploads to our shores. French Canadians 
also have crossed the border in large numbers and crowded 
into the mill-towns of New England. Asa result we had, in 
1910, thirteen and a half millions of foreign-born people in 
our population, distributed as shown in Figure 80, of whom 
practically forty per cent had come from the South and East 
of Europe. Of the immigration since 1900 almost eighty 
per cent has come from there. In addition to these thirteen 
and a half millions of foreign-born, an additional nine and 
a half million were native-born, but the children of foreign 
parents, and of another six million one parent was foreign- 
born. 
These Southern and Eastern Europeans were of a very 
different type from the North and West Europeans who pre- 
ceded them. Largely illiterate, docile, lacking in initia- 
tive, and almost wholly without the Anglo-Saxon concep- 
tions of righteousness, liberty, law, order, public decency, and 
government, their coming has served to dilute tremendously 
our national stock and to weaken and corrupt our political 
life. Settling largely in the cities of the North, the agricul- 
tural regions of the Middle and the Far West, and the min- 
ing districts of the mountain regions, they have created 
serious problems in housing and living, moral and sanitary 
conditions, and honest and decent government, while popu- 
lar education has everywhere been made more difficult by 
their presence. The result has been that in many sections 
of our country foreign manners, customs, observances, and 
Tanguage have tended to supplant native ways and the Eng- 
lish speech, while the so-called “melting-pot” has had more 
than it could handle. The new peoples, and especially 
those from the South and East of Europe, have come so fast 
that we have been unable to absorb and assimilate them, 
and our national life, for the past quarter of a century, has 
been afflicted with a serious case of racial indigestion.

  840 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
The United States to-day a great cosmopolitan mixture. 
The result of this great world-wide movement of peoples is 
that the United States to-day represents the most cosmopoli- 
tan mixture of peoples and races to be found anywhere on the 
face of the earth. Only in the Southern States is there an 
absence of a large percentage of foreign-born, and there the 
problem of the negro and his education takes the place of the 
foreign-born educational problem. 
How great the American mixture is we scarcely realize 
until we take stock of our neighbors. We buy our groceries 
of Knudsen and Larsen, our meats of Klieber and Engel- 
meier, our bread of Rudolf Krause, Petar Petarovich de- 
livers our milk, Giuseppe Battali removes our garbage, Swen 
Swensen delivers our ice, Takahira Matsui is our cook, and 
Nicholas Androvsky has recently taken the place of Pancho 
Garcia as our gardener. We occasionally take dinner at a 
café managed by Schiavetti and Montagnini, we buy our 
haberdashery of Moses Ickelheimer, Isaac Rosenstein is our 
tailor, Azniv Arakelian sells us our cigars, and Thirmutis 
Poulis supplies our wants in ice cream and candies. Timo- 
thy Mehegan represents our ward in the city council, Patrick 
O’Grady is the policeman on our beat, Nellie O’Brien teaches 
our little girl at school, Nels Petersen is our postman, 
Vladimir Constantinovitch is our street-sweeper, Lazar 
Obichan reads our electric meter, Lorenzo Guercio sells 
potted plants and flowers on the corner, Mahmoud Bey 
peddles second-grade fruit past our door, and Alexis Grab- 
lowsky mends and presses our suits and cleans our hats in 
a little shop two blocks down the street. The service ga- 
rage, run by Pestarino and Pozzi, looks after our car, Emil 
Frankfurter is the cashier at our bank, Kleanthis Vassar- 
dakis shines shoes in our office building, and Wilhelmina 
Weinstein is our office stenographer. The recent military 
poster, calling attention to the draft registration of those 
18 to 45, was repeated in fifteen different languages on 
the sheet. The casualty list in the morning paper as we 
write announces that, among others, such representative

American citizens as Rudolph Kochensparger, Robert Em- 
met O’Hanlon, Ralph McGregor, John Jones, Rastus Brown, 
Pietro Sturla, Rafael Gonzales, Dominico Sebatino, Ignace 
Olzanski, Diego Lemos, and Manthos Zakis have made the 
supreme sacrifice on the battle-fields of France in defense 
of the civilization of the world. If our earlier statesmen 
were concerned at the coming of the Irish and the Ger- 
mans, well may we be alarmed at the deluge of diverse peo- 
ples which has poured into this Nation during the past forty 
years. 
Assimilation and amalgamation. The problem which 
has faced and still faces the United States is that of assimi- 
lating these thousands of foreigners into our national life and 
citizenship. We must do this or lose our national character. 
The German tried to solve the problem with his subject peo- 
ples by coercion, and failed; the French and English hold 
their colonials by kind, considerate, and good government; 
we have either neglected the problem entirely or have 
trusted to our schools to handle the children and to our labor 
unions to initiate the adults. Asa result, the census of 1910 
showed that we had among us ten millions of foreign-born 
who professed no allegiance to the land of their adoption, 
and a large percentage of this number could neither read 
nor write English. Still worse, many of the number live in 
foreign settlements or foreign quarters in our cities, where 
they can get along without even speaking the English lan- 
guage, and their children not infrequently are sent to a non- 
English-speaking parochial school. Of the 11,726,506 im- 
migrants who came to us during the four years preceding 
the outbreak of the World War, 26.5 per cent were unable 
to read and write any language, and not over 12 per cent 
could speak English. 
In view of the large migrations of diverse peoples to us 
since 1845 we were fortunate, indeed, that before that time 
we had settled in the affirmative the question of general 
education at public expense; that we had provided for 
English schools, even for the Germans of Pennsylvania;  
-P-A-G-E-380
  342 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
and that we had definitely eliminated the sectarian school 
from our program for public education. A common English 
language, our common law and political institutions, our 
common democratic life, our newspaper habit, our free so- 
cial intercourse, our common free schools, our ease of commu- 
nication, our tolerance of other peoples, and the general ab- 
sence of a priesthood bent on holding nationalities together 
for religious ends — all these have helped us in the assimila- 
tion of other races. On the other hand, the process has been 
retarded by the coming of such numbers, by city congre- 
gation and segregation, by the coming of so many male 
adults without their wives and children, by the work of the 
Germans in trying to preserve their language and racial hab- 
its and Kultur, and by the work of the Catholic and Lutheran 
churches in endeavoring to hold nationalities together. 
The greatest success in assimilating the new peoples who 
have come to us has been made by the school and the labor 
unions, but up to recent years the school has reached only 
the children of those classes bringing their families with 
them and who have not been attracted by the foreign-lan- 
guage parochial school. With these children the results 
have in general been remarkable, and the schools have proved 
to be our greatest agency for unifying the diverse elements 
of our population. Even under the best circumstances, 
though, it requires time to so assimilate the foreign-born 
that they come to have our conceptions of law and order 
and government, and come to act in harmony with the spirit 
and purpose of our American national ideals. After this end 
has been attained, which usually requires two or three gen- 
erations, the amalgamation of the descendants of these 
peoples into our evolving American racial stock may take 
place through intermarriage and the mixture of blood. As- 
similation is a blending of civilizations and customs to create 
that homogeneity necessary for citizenship and national feel- 
ing, and may be promoted by education and social institu- 
tions and wise legislation; amalgamation is a blending of 
races and bloods, and is a process of centuries. Through
-P-A-G-E-381
NEW MODIFYING FORCES 843 
the assimilation of all our diverse elements we are preparing 
the way for that future amalgamation of racial elements 
which will in time produce the American race. 
II. Tue Inpustr1aLt REVOLUTION 
Industrial changes since 1850. In Chapter IV, under the 
heading “Rise of Manufacturing,” we traced somewhat 
briefly the beginnings of manufacturing in the United States, 
and pointed out how the application of steam, the perfecting 
of inventions, and the development of transportation rev- 
olutionized the industrial methods of our people of the north- 
eastern part of the United States, between 1820 and 1850. 
We also pointed out how these industrial changes and the 
rise of the factory system meant the beginnings of the break- 
ing up of home and village industry, the inauguration of a 
cityward movement of the population, the rise of entirely 
new educational and social problems, the ultimate concen- 
tration of manufacturing in large establishments, and the 
consequent rise of the city to a very important place in our 
national life. 
The changes which had been accomplished by 1850, 
though, or even by 1860, were but the beginnings of a vast 
change in the nature of our national life which has since 
gone forward with ever-increasing rapidity, and has extended 
to all parts of the Nation. As a result the United States 
stands to-day as the greatest manufacturing country of the 
whole world. There are few things connected with the 
wonderful development of our country since 1850 which 
stand out more prominently than the amazing rapidity with 
which we have gone to the front as a manufacturing nation. 
Awakening to the wonderful possibilities which the vast 
native resources in iron, coal, timber, and mineral wealth 
of the country gave us; utilizing the best European, and 
especially the best English manufacturing experience; and 
applying new technical knowledge, which in 1860 we had 
scarcely begun to teach, — Yankee ingenuity and energy 
and brains have since pushed American products to the front  
-P-A-G-E-382
ee ne 
| 344 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
by leaps and bounds. In textiles, in iron and steel products, 
and in high-grade tools and machinery in particular, our 
American products successfully compete throughout the 
world. In coal production, the lumber industry, and in agri- 
culture the United States to-day stands first. The packing 
and exporting of meats and meat products has also become a 
great national industry, and American refrigerated beef and 
bacon and hams are sent to all quarters of the globe. In 
hundreds of specialized industries, such as the manufacture 
of furniture, desks, typewriters, office conveniences, auto- 
mobiles, motor-cycles, bicycles, farm tractors, reapers and 
threshers, locomotives, printing-presses, sewing machines, 
surgical instruments, edge tools, electrical goods, plumb- 
ing supplies, phonographs, rifles, explosives, cotton goods, 
and shoes, American manufactured articles supply not only 
the home market, but are exported all over the world. 
Scarcely a year has passed, during the last forty at least, 
that American inventive genius and energy and labor com- 
bined have not wrested from other nations a world-lead in 
some new article of manufacture, and the result of the 
World War promises to be that the leadership in many new 
lines will pass to us. Particularly do we promise to gain at 
the expense of Germany in such large and important lines as 
the manufacture of dyes and chemicals, in which for so long 
the Germans had the lead. 
Vast changes since Lincoln’s day. We can perhaps get a 
better idea of the tremendous industrial development of 
the United States since 1860 if we try to picture to ourselves 
the things with which Lincoln was unacquainted. When he 
died, in 1865, the world was relatively simple and undevel- 
oped, and business methods were old-fashioned compared 
with what we know to-day. If Lincoln were to return now 
and walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, in Washington, he 
would be astonished at the things he would see. Buildings

The smooth-paved streets and cement sidewalks would be

sanitary plumbing, steam heating, electric lights, electric 
fans, telephones, typewriters, modern office furniture and 
filing devices, the Edison phonograph and dictaphone, and 
the fountain pen would have to be explained to him. In his 
day plumbing was in its beginnings, coal-oil lamps and gas- 
jets were just coming into use, and the steel pen had but 
recently superseded the quill. There were stenographers 
then, but all letters and papers were still written out by hand. 
As for communication, messenger boys with written notes 
ran everywhere on foot, and the transaction of all kinds of 
business was exceedingly slow. The telegraph had recently 
been installed, but it still required two weeks to get news 
from England, and two months from Manila or Valparaiso.

Lincoln died, while such terms as “bacteria,” “eugenics,” 
“evolution,” and “sanitation” were seldom used or entirely 
unknown. Much of what every one ate or wore was still 
manufactured in the home, the apprenticeship system still 
ruled in almost all lines, and every youngster still had 
“chores” to do and enough physical and manual activity 
to answer all human needs. Life was still relatively simple, 
agriculture was still the great industry of the people, and 
77.8 per cent of the people of the Nation still lived on the 
farms. But 16.1 per cent had settled in cities of 8000 or 
more inhabitants, and there were but 141 of these in the 
entire United States. 
Changes in the nature of living. Since 1865 vast and far- 
reaching changes have taken place in the nature and char- 
acter of our living, with the result that we live to-day, in 
many respects, in an entirely new world. During the past 
hundred years steam and steel, and during the past forty 
years electricity and medical science, have wrought an altera- 
tion in human living greater than was wrought in all the time 
from the Crusades up to a hundred years ago. 
Along with the far-reaching industrial transformation has 
come a tremendous increase in the sum of our common hu- 
man knowledge. The applications of science have become so 
numerous, books and magazines havesomultiplied andcheap- 
ened, trade and industry have become so specialized, all 
kinds of life have been so increased in complexity, and the 
inter-relationships of mankind have been so extended and 
have grown so intricate, that what one needs to know to-day 
has been greatly increased over what was the case half to 
three quarters of a century ago. Once the ability to read 
and write and cipher distinguished the educated from the 
uneducated man; to-day the man who knows only these 
simple arts is an uneducated man, hardly fitted to meet the 
struggle for existence in which he is placed, and certainly not 
fitted to participate in the complex industrial and political 
life of which he now forms a part. 
Since 1860 cities have greatly increased in number and in  
-P-A-G-E-385
NEW MODIFYING FORCES 347 
the complexity of their life. From 141 of 8000 inhabitants 
or over in 1860, there are over 1200 of over 10,000 to-day, 
and some 15,000 incorporated towns and cities of all sizes. 
Approximately one half our people to-day live in incorporated 
towns or cities, as against one sixth sixty years ago. Great 
numbers of people of all kinds have congregated together in 
the cities, as the industrial life of the Nation has developed, 
and within recent decades entire new cities have been built 
and developed to supply the needs of the workers in some 
one or two lines or a group of related industries. 
Rural life also greatly changed. The effects of the indus- 
trial revolution have not been confined to the cities alone, 
but have extended to all parts of our national life. Life in 
the rural districts has experienced an almost equally great 
change in character and direction. During the past thirty 
years in particular there have been marked alterations in the 
character of life on the farm. Nearly everywhere the harsh 
conditions and limitations of the earlier period have been 
modified, everywhere the applications of science and the 
products of the press have made their way and rendered life 
easier and created new interests, everywhere new medical 
and sanitary knowledge have made rural life more desirable, 
and everywhere the old isolation and the narrow provin- 
cialism of the rural classes are passing away. The great 
world-wide increase in city population and in the number en- 
gaged in the manufacturing industries, all of whom are food 
and clothing consumers but not producers, coupled with a 
world-wide increase in the standard of living and the per 
capita food and clothing consumption of the people, have 
created much greater demands for fruits, grains, meats, 
hides, cotton, and wool than heretofore. The general intro- 
duction of scientific processes and methods and machinery, 
the development of farming on a large scale, and the open- 
ing of world-wide markets due to the perfecting of means of 
transportation, have alike combined to change farming from 
a self-subsistence industry and make of it a profitable busi- 
ness undertaking. Near our large cities, intensive truck gar-
-P-A-G-E-386
848 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
dening has been extensively developed, and in this our foreign- 
born have been particularly successful. New agricultural 
, Tegions have been opened, new grains and fruits introduced 
into old regions, new methods of marketing and preserving 
demonstrated, and new bookkeeping methods have been 
employed. Largely as a result of the work of the new agri- 
cultural colleges, agricultural education has been placed on 
a firm foundation, and practical and helpful assistance has 
been extended to farmers all over the United States. 
Within recent years a marked change in the character of 
the farming population itself has taken place. In the richest 
agricultural sections of our country the earlier sturdy type 
of American farmer is everywhere giving way to the tenant 
farmer, because he is leasing his farm and moving to the 
town or city to live more comfortably and to give his children 
better educational and social advantages. From thirty to 
forty per cent of the farms in the North Central States, and 
from fifty to sixty-five per cent of the farms in the South, are 
to-day let out to tenant farmers. Still more, the foreign- 
born tenant is rapidly displacing the native-born, and 
Italians, Austro-Huns, Poles, Slavs, Bulgars, Serbs, Ar- 
menians, and Japanese, and in the South Italians and 
negroes, are to-day replacing the well-to-do native farmer 
of an earlier period, and it is probable that the movement of 
these new peoples to the farms is as yet only in its beginnings. 
Capable agriculturists, thrifty and economical, they pass 
successively from farm laborer to tenant, and from tenant 
to owner. The agricultural consequences of these changes 
in the character of our rural population may not be very 
significant, but the educational and social consequences are 
very important and very far-reaching. 
III. Errect of THESE CHANGES ON THE HomE 
Changes in the character of industry. With the great in- 
dustrial development of our country, and the concentration 
of industries about certain centers of population where cheap 
labor is plentiful, the character of home life has altered
-P-A-G-E-387
NEW MODIFYING FORCES 349 
greatly. To these centers both the country resident and 
the immigrant have been attracted in large numbers. The 
opportunities for gaining a livelihood there at easier or more 
remunerative labor have drawn to these population-centers 
many who have found great difficulty in adjusting them- 
selves to the new and peculiar life. The most energetic and 
capable of our people, as well as the most vicious and corrupt, 
have seen larger opportunity for success in the city and have 
left better home-life conditions to join the city throngs. 
The modern city is essentially a center of trade and indus- 
try, and home life and home conditions must inevitably be 
determined and conditioned by this fact. The increasing 
specialization in all fields of labor has divided the people into 
dozens of more or less clearly defined classes, and the in- 
creasing centralization of trade and industry has concen- 
trated business in the hands of a relatively small number of 
people. All standards of business efficiency indicate that this 
should be the case, but as a result of it the small merchant 
and employer are fast giving way to large mercantile and 
commercial concerns. No longer can a man save up a few 
thousand dollars and start in business for himself with much 
chance of success. The employee tends to remain an em- 
ployee; the wage-earner tends to remain a wage-earner. 
New discoveries and improved machinery and methods have 
greatly increased the complexity of the industrial process 
in all lines of work, and the worker in every field of trade and 
industry tends more and more to become a cog in the ma- 
chine, and to lose sight of his part in the industrial processes 
and his place in our industrial and civic and national life. 
The effect of such conditions on the family has been very 
noticeable, and in some respects very unfortunate. Under 
the older village and rural-life conditions a large family was 
an asset, as every boy and girl could help about the house 
and farm from an early age. In doing this they received 
much valuable education and training. City life, though, 
has changed a large family from an asset toa serious liability, 
and the result is shown in the large number of small or child-
-P-A-G-E-388
ee ee er a ey Pere ee ee eee ee 
850 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
less families found there. Only among the foreign-born and 
in rural communities does one any longer find large families 
common. The native American, and the more thoughtful 
citizen generally, tends to limit the size of his family to the 
few children he can clothe and educate according to his 
standard of life. 
Changes in the character of home life. As a result of the 
changes of living incident to the change from an agricultural 
to an industrial society, and the rapid development of city- 
life conditions, the home life has greatly altered in character. 
Once it was a center where the rudiments of almost all the 
trades and industries of life were practiced, and where both 
boy and girl obtained many valuable life experiences. In 
the villages, blacksmiths, wagon-makers, cabinet-makers, 
harness-makers, shoemakers, millers, and saw-mill workers 
carried on most of the fundamental trades. In their small 
establishments the complete industrial processes were car- 
ried through, and could be seen and learned. In the homes 
girls were taught to sew, make hats and clothing, cook, bake, 
wash, iron, mend, and clean the house. On the farm the boy 
learned to plant, cultivate, and reap the crops, care for and 
feed the horses and stock, watch and learn to read the signs 
of the weather, mend wagons and harness, make simple re- 
pairs, and go to town onerrands. The boy in town as well 
had the daily “chores” to attend to. 
These conditions, within the past half-century, have 
largely passed away. Since about 1890 the process of change 
has been particularly rapid. The farm is no longer the center 
of industry it used to be. Purchases at city stores supply 
much that formerly required hand labor. Both the farmer 
and his wife have been freed from much that used to consti- 
tute the drudgery of life, and have been given much new time 
to read and think and travel. In the villages the small arti- 
sans and their apprentices have almost completely disap- 
peared. Wagons now come from South Bend, furniture is 
made largely in Grand Rapids, harness comes largely from 
New York State, and shoes from the cities of eastern Mas-
-P-A-G-E-389
  NEW MODIFYING FORCES 351 
sachusetts, while flour is ground in large mills in a few in- 
dustrial centers. The telephone, the delivery wagon, the 
elevator, gas and electricity, running water, the bakery and 
delicatessen shop, the steam laundry, and the large depart- 
ment store have taken from children their “chores” and 
from their parents much hard labor. As a result homes in 
our cities have come to be little more than places where 
families eat and sleep and children grow up. 
There are many compensating advantages, it must be 
remembered, for the losses the home has sustained. Chil- 
dren grow up under much more sanitary conditions than 
formerly, are better cared for, have far greater educational 
advantages provided for them, learn much more from their 
surroundings, are not so overworked, and have opportuni- 
ties which children did not have in an earlier day. Still, a 
boy or girl under modern living conditions has so little of the 
old-fashioned home-life, so little useful manual activity, and 
acquires so much information through the eye and the ear 
and the senses and so little by actual doing, that the problem 
of providing a proper environment and education for town 
and city children, and of utilizing their excess leisure time in 
profitable activities, has become one of the most serious as 
well as one of the most difficult social and educational prob- 
lems now before us. 
The home, nevertheless, has gained. Despite the con- 
centration of industry and business in the hands of a small 
percentage of our people, the virtual abolition of apprentice- 
ship, the concentration of manufacturing in large establish- 
ments where specialized labor is the rule, and the prevalence 
of much poverty and wretchedness among certain classes of 
our people, society as a whole is by no means the worse for 
the change, and in particular the poor have not been grow- 
ing poorer. The drudgery and wasteful toil of life have 
been greatly mitigated. People have leisure for personal 
enjoyment previously unknown. The trolley-car, the auto- 
mobile, and the “movies” have brought rest, recreation, and 
enjoyment to millions of people who in previous times knew
-P-A-G-E-390
352 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
only work, and whose pleasures consisted chiefly of neighbor- 
hood gossip, church attendance, and drink. Wages have 
increased faster than the cost of living, the advantages of 
education have been multiplied and extended, health condi- 
tions in home and shop and town are better than ever 
known before, much more is done for people by the corpora- 
tions and the State than formerly, and the standard of com- 
fort for those even in the humblest circumstances has ad- 
vanced beyond all previous conception. The poorest work- 
man to-day can enjoy in his home lighting undreamed of in 
the days of tallow candles, warmth beyond the power of the 
the old smoky soft-coal grate, kitchen conveniences and an 
ease in kitchen work that our New England forefathers prob- 
ably would have thought sinful, and sanitary conditions and 
conveniences beyond the reach of the wealthiest even half 
acentury ago. If the owner of the poorest tenement house 
in our cities to-day were to install the kind of plumbing 
which was good enough for George Washington, we should 
lock him up. The family as a unit has gained tremendously 
by the changes of the past forty to fifty years; the losses 
have come to the children and to society and government. 
Weakening of the old educative influences. As an ac- 
companiment of the far-reaching nature of these recent 
changes in the character of our living and of our population, 
there has followed a general weakening of the old social 
customs and traditions which once exercised so strong a 
restraining and educative influence on the young. Children 
formerly, much more than now, were taught reverence, 
courtesy, respect, proper demeanor, obedience, honesty, 
fidelity, and virtue, and both boys and girls were trained in 
useful employments. The Church, too, was a much more 
potent factor in the lives of both old and young than it is 
to-day. The young were trained to go to Sunday School 
and Church, and Sunday was observed as a day of rest and 
religious devotion. The minister was generally respected 
and looked up to by both parents and children. A religious 
sanction for conduct was often set forth. Communities

                                               NEW MODIFYING FORCES 353 
were small and homogeneous in character, and every one’s 
actions were every one’s business. The community code of 
conduct and community sentiment exercised strong re- 
straints. The positive convictions of the older members 
served to check the tendencies toward waywardness in both 
boys and girls, while the number of opportunities to go 
wrong were much fewer than they are to-day. Along cer- 
tain lines these early restraining influences were highly edu- 
cative, served to keep many a boy and girl in the path of 
rectitude, and helped to train them for an honest and a 
respectable life. 
Changes that have taken place. In some of our smaller 
and older communities these conditions still in part persist, 
though much modified by the character of present-day life, 
but in the cities, towns, and the newer parts of the country 
these older educative influences and traditions have largely 
broken down, or have entirely ceased to exist. The little 
homogeneous communities, with their limited outlook and 
local spirit, have been changed in character by the coming 
of a much more cosmopolitan population, semi-urban condi- 
tions, and a much freer and easier life. The Church has lost 
much of its hold and influence over the young, and fre- 
quently the parents give it only nominal allegiance. Thou- 
sands of children are growing up to-day without any kind of 
religious training, and the former general knowledge of Bib- 
lical history and characters has largely passed away. New 
sects and religions, as well as new nationalities and races of 
people, have come among us, and within a generation the 
character of Sunday observance has greatly changed. The 
attitude of the people generally toward the old problems has 
been materially altered. Parents everywhere are less strict 
than they used to be. The discipline of the young in obe- 
dience and proper demeanor is no longer fashionable, and 
the attitude of thousands of communities to-day, as ex- 
pressed in their life, their newspapers, their city govern- 
ment, and their general failure to enforce obedience to law, is 
really opposed to righteousness and good citizenship. The
-P-A-G-E-392
  854 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
home, altogether too often, is unintelligent and neglectful 
in the handling of children, and not infrequently it has ab- 
dicated entirely and turned the whole matter of the educa- 
tion and discipline of the young over to the public school to 
handle. 
The effect of all these changes in our mode of living is 
written large on our national life. The social and industrial 
revolutions which we have experienced have been far- 
reaching in their consequences. The home and life condi- 
tions of an earlier period are gone, never to return. This 
country has passed through that stage of its national de- 
velopment. Instead, we now form a part of a new and 
vastly more complex world civilization, in competition with 
the best brains of all mankind, with a great and an ever- 
increasing specialization of human effort taking place on all 
sides, and with new and ever more difficult social, commer- 
cial, industrial, educational, and human-life problems await- 
ing solution. We have given up our earlier isolation and 
independence, — social, political, and industrial, — and 
have become dependent even for the necessities of life upon 
the commerce of remote regions and distant peoples. For 
us the world has become both larger and smaller than it used 
to be, and its parts are linked up with our future welfare to 
an extent never known before. The Spanish War did much 
to destroy our earlier isolation and independence; the great 
World War has cast us upon the middle of the world stage. 
IV. Errect oF THESE CHANGES ON THE SCHOOL 
New national needs make new demands. It is impossible 
to understand the present complexity of American public 
education, and the many new lines of educational effort be- 
ing put into practice in our schools, except in the light of the 
great social and industrial and home-life changes of the past 
half-century which we have just traced. It is these vast 
and far-reaching social and industrial and home-life changes 
which have been behind the changes in direction which our 
public schools have taken during the past quarter of a cen-
-P-A-G-E-393
NEW MODIFYING FORCES 355 
tury, and which underlie the most pressing problems in edu- 
cational readjustment of the present. It is as true to-day 
as when public schools began that the nature of the national 
need must determine the character of the education pro- 
vided. As civilization increases in complexity, education 
must broaden its activities and increase in efficiency. 
Our schools are essentially time- and labor-saving devices, 
created by us to serve democracy’s needs. To convey to 
the next generation the knowledge and accumulated experi- 
ence of the past, important as this may be, we now see is 
neither the only nor the chief function of public education. 
Instead, our schools, within the past quarter-century, have 
been asked to prepare their children more definitely for per- 
sonal usefulness in life, and the future citizen more directly 
for the to-morrow of our complex national and international 
existence. Instead of mere teaching institutions, engaged 
in imparting book-information and imposing discipline, our 
schools have been asked to grasp the significance of their 
social relationships, to transform themselves more fully into 
institutions for the improvement of democracy, and to pre- 
pare the young who attend them for greater social efficiency 
by teaching more that is directly useful and by training 
them better for citizenship in a democracy such as ours. 
A new lengthening of the period of dependence. As 
modern city-life conditions have come more and more to sur- 
round both boys and girls, depriving them of the training 
and education which earlier farm and village life once gave, 
the school has been called to take upon itself the task of 
giving training in those industrial experiences and social ac- 
tivities which once formed so important a part of the edu- 
cation of American youths. With the breakdown of the old 
home and village industries, the passing of the old “chores,” 
and the coming of the factory system and city-life conditions, 
it has come to be desirable that children should not engage 
in productive labor. On the contrary, all recent thinking 
and legislation have been opposed to their doing so. Both 
the interests of organized labor and the interests of the
-P-A-G-E-394
356 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Nation have set against child-labor. Even from an economic 
point of view, all studies which have been made as to the 
money-value of an education have shown the importance 
of children remaining in school as long as they are able to 
use with advantage the educational opportunities provided.

Everywhere the right of the State to compel communities 
to maintain not only the old common school, but special 
types of schools and advanced training, has been asserted 
and sustained by the courts. Conversely, the corollary to 
this assertion of authority, the right of the State to compel 
children to partake of the educational advantages provided, 
has also been asserted and sustained by the courts. 
New social and national problems. As our social life has 
become broader and more complex, a longer period of guid- 
ance has become necessary to prepare for proper participa: 
tion init. As our industrial life has become more diversified, 
 
-P-A-G-E-395
NEW MODIFYING FORCES 357 
its parts narrower, and its processes more concealed, new 
and more extended training has been called for to prepare 
the worker for his task, to reveal to him something of the in- 
tricacy and interdependence of our modern social and indus- 
trial life, and to point out to him the necessity of each man’s 
part in the social and industrial whole. With the ever- 
increasing subdivision and specialization of labor, the danger 
from class subdivision has been constantly increasing, and 
more and more has been thrown upon the school the task 
of instilling into all a social and political consciousness that 
will lead to unity amid our great diversity, and to united ac- 
tion for the preservation and improvement of our democratic 
institutions. As large numbers of the foreign-born have 
come to our shores, and particularly from countries where 
general education is not common and where the Anglo- 
Saxon conception of law, order, government, and public and 
private decency do not prevail, a new and still greater bur- 
den has been placed on all the educative forces of society to 
try to impart to these new peoples, and their children, some- 
thing of the method and the meaning of our democratic life. 
As the children of these new classes have crowded into our 
public schools, our school systems have been compelled to 
pay more attention to the needs of these new elements in 
our population, and to direct their attention less exclusively 
to satisfying the needs of the well-to-do classes of society. 
Education has in consequence recently turned away still 
more from its earlier aristocratic nature, and has become 
more and more democratic in character. It is only as schools 
serve as instruments for the perpetuation and improvement 
of our democratic life that the general education of all at 
public expense can be justified. 
Beginnings of the change. The period following 1860 was 
a period of internal reorganization of our elementary educa- 
tion. As has been shown, the school then became more 
clearly conscious of itself, and reorganized its teaching work 
along lines dictated by the new psychology of instruction 
which had come to us from abroad. The thorough adoption
-P-A-G-E-396
358 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
of this new psychological point of view covered the period 
from 1860 up to about 1900. Beginning back about 1880 
to 1885, however, our schools began to experience a new but 
steady change in purpose and direction along the lines of 
the new social and democratic forces, though it is only since 
about 1900 that any marked and rapid changes have set in.

The old limited book-subject curriculum, both elementary 
and secondary, could no longer meet the changing character 
of our national life, and new studies began to be introduced. 
Drawing, clay modeling, color work, nature-study, sewing, 
cooking, and manual training were introduced here and there 
into city elementary schools, and the sciences and the man- 
ual and home arts into the high schools. This was done 
despite the objections of many conservative teachers and| 
citizens, and much ridicule from the public press. Many 
spoke sneeringly of the new subjects as representing the 
   
-P-A-G-E-397
  NEW MODIFYING FORCES 359 
“fads and frills” of education, but they slowly made a place 
for themselves and have ever since remained. The cities, 
as in practically all other educational advances, were the 
leaders in introducing these new subjects and in attempting 
to transform their schools from mere disciplinary institu- 
tions, where drill was given in the mastery of the rudiments 
of knowledge, into institutions of democracy calculated to 
train for useful service in the office, the shop, and the home, 
and intended to prepare young people for intelligent par- 
ticipation in the increasingly complex social and political 
life of our democratic society. 
At first these new studies were introduced as experiments, 
and came in as new drill and disciplinary studies. Their 
introduction was generally defended on disciplinary grounds. 
Anattempt also was made to organize a definite psychological 
procedure for instruction in each, as had recently been done 
for the older fundamental subjects. In consequence these 
new subjects for a time made but slow headway, and the re- 
sults obtained were not always:what had been expected.

more since 1895 to think out and state for us an educational 
philosophy suited to the changed and changing conditions 
in our national life, is John Dewey (1859- ), for many 
years head of the School of Education at the University 
of Chicago, but more recently Professor of Philosophy at 
Columbia University. His work, both experimental and 
theoretical, has tended both to psychologize and socialize 
American education; to give to it a practical content, along 
scientific and industrial lines; and to interpret to the child 
the new social conditions of modern society by connecting the 
activities of the school closely with those of real life. Believ- 
ing that the public school is the chief remedy for the ills of 
society, he has tried to change the work of the school so as to 
make it a miniature of society itself. Social efficiency, and 
not mere knowledge, he conceives to be the end, and this

social efficiency is to be produced through participation in 
the activities of an institution of society, the school. The 
different parts of the school system thus become a unified 
institution, in which children are taught how to live amid 
the complexities of modern social life. 
Education, therefore, in Dewey’s conception, involves 
not merely learning, but play, construction, use of tools, con- 
tact with nature, expression, and activity, and the school 
should be a place where children are working rather than 
listening, learning life by living life, and becoming ac- 
quainted with social institutions and industrial processes by 
studying them. The work of the school is in large part to 
reduce the complexity of modern life to such terms as chil- 
dren can understand, and to introduce the child to modern 
life through simplified experiences. Its primary business 
may be said to be to train children in codperative and mutu- 
ally helpful living. The virtues of a school, as Dewey points 
| out, are learning by doing; the use of muscles, sight and feel- 
ing, as well as hearing; and the employment of energy, origi- 
nality, and initiative. The virtues of the school in the past 
were the colorless, negative virtues of obedience, docility, 
and submission. Mere obedience and the careful perform- 
ance of imposed tasks he holds to be not only a poor pre- 
paration for social and industrial efficiency, but a poor 
preparation for democratic society and government as well. 
Responsibility for good government, with us, rests with all, 
and the school should prepare for the political life of to-mor- 
row by training its pupils to meet responsibilities, develop- 
ing initiative, awakening social insight, and causing each to 
shoulder a fair share of the work of government in the school. 
Remarkable progress since 1898. The Spanish-American 
War of 1898 served to awaken us as a Nation and to shake 
us out of our earlier national isolation and contentment. 
Among other things it revealed to us something of the posi- 
tion we should probably be called upon to occupy in world 
affairs. Both it and the Russo-Japanese War which fol- 
lowed served particularly to concentrate attention on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-399
NEW MODIFYING FORCES 361 
advantages of general education, as it was “the man behind 
the gun” who won in each war. For the two decades fol- 
lowing the Spanish-American War our country experienced 
an unprecedented period of industrial development and 
national prosperity, while the immigration of peoples further 
removed from our racial stock reached a maximum. The 
specialization of labor and the introduction of labor-saving 
machinery took place to an extent before unknown; city 
conditions became even more complex and potentially more 
dangerous; villages grew more urban, and a more cosmopoli- 
tan attitude began to pervade our whole life; the national 
feeling was intensified; and the national and state govern- 
ments were called upon to do many things for the benefit of 
the people never attempted before. 
In consequence, since 1898, public education has awak- 
ened a public interest before unknown. _ Since 1900 the 
Southern States have experienced the greatest educational | 
awakening in their history — an awakening to be compared. 
with that_of Mann in Massachusetts and Barnard in Con- 
necticut and Rhode Island. Everywhere state educational 
commissions and city school surveys have evidenced a new 
critical attitude on the part of the public. Much new edu- 
cational legislation has been enacted; permission has been 
changed to obligation; minimum requirements have been 
laid down by the States in many new directions; and new 
subjects of instruction have been added by law. Courses 
of study have been entirely made over, and new types of 
textbooks have appeared. The democratic American high 
school has been transformed into a truly national institution. 
New normal schools have been founded, and higher re- 
quirements have been ordered for those desiring to teach. 
College departments of education have increased from nine 
in 1890 (first permanent chair in 1873) to something like 
four hundred to-day. Private gifts to colleges and univer- 
sities have exceeded anything known before in any land. 
School taxes have been increased, old school funds have been 
more carefully guarded, and new constitutional provisions
-P-A-G-E-400
362 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
as to education have been added. Compulsory education 
has begun to be a reality, and child-labor laws to be enforced. 
A new interest in child-welfare and child-hygiene has arisen, 
evidencing a commendable desire to look after the bodies 
as well as the minds of our children. The education of the de- 
fective and the delinquent, and the education of the foreign- 
born everywhere, have received new attention. In recent 
years a new and an extensive national interest in agricultural, 
industrial, vocational, and household education has become 
clearly evident. However much we may have lost interest 
in the old problems of faith and religion, the American people 
has come to believe thoroughly in education as the best 
means for the preservation and advancement of the na- 
tional welfare. In the chapters which follow the changes 
and additions and expansions which have accompanied the 
educational evolution of the past quarter-century will be set 
forth in some detail. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. Show how the fact that all the earlier immigrants, except the Irish, 
came from lands which had accepted the Protestant Reformation 
ideas as to education made their assimilation easier. 
2. Explain why the recent South and East of Europe immigration has 
served to dilute our national stock, and weaken and corrupt our 
political life. 
8. Show how we have left the problem of adult assimilation largely to 
the labor unions and the political boss. 
4, Canada allowed Quebec to retain its French language on entering the 
Union of Canada, with bad results. Show what might have been the 
result had we allowed Pennsylvania to remain a German-language State. 
5. Why is it much more dangerous when any foreign element collects 
in colonies than if it scatters? 
6. Show why the extensive changes in home life since 1860 have neces- 
sitated a different type of education, and changed the large family 
from an asset to a liability. 
7. What are the effects of the foreign-born tenant farmer on rural social 
life and the rural school? 
8. It is often stated that the coming of so many foreign-born to America 
has tended to decrease the size of native American families, Why 
should it? 
9. Show how the vast industrial and commercial development has tended
-P-A-G-E-401
NEW MODIFYING FORCES 368 
to limit individual opportunities, and made broader education for all 
necessary. 
10. Show how the elimination of waste and drudgery and disease has 
also made larger educational opportunities desirable. 
11. How do you account for the change in the character of home training 
and discipline? 
12. Would schools have advanced in importance as they have done had 
the industrial revolution not taken place? Why? 
13. Why is more extended education called for as “industrial life becomes 
more diversified, its parts narrower, and its processes more con- 
cealed?”’ 
14. Point out the social significance of the educational work of John 
Dewey. 
15. Explain why the social and national changes since the Spanish Amer- 
ican War should have led especially to the expansion of the high 
school. 
16. Point out, the value, in the new order of society, of each group of 
school subjects listed on page 370.

CHAPTER XII 
NEW EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTIONS AND EXTENSIONS 
I. New Conception or THE EpucaTIoNAL Process 
The old knowledge conception. Our earlier school work 
was carried on on the unexpressed assumption that children 
were alike in needs and capacities, and that the training 
necessary for citizenship and life consisted in their acquiring 
certain book-knowledge which the school sought to impart. 
While some children were able to remain longer in school 
than were others, and consequently could climb higher 
on the educational ladder, the type of training while ascend- 
ing the ladder was practically the same for all. Only in the 
high school were some options allowed. The knowledge 
aim, as we have seen, everywhere dominated instruction. 
Knowledge and civic virtue came to be regarded as some- 
what synonymous, and disciplinary drill was the main pur- 
pose of the teaching process. 
The psychological conception of the educational process, 
evolved between 1860 and 1890, also was based on an as- 
sumption that the mind could be trained by a uniform pro- 
cedure. By means of selected subject-matter, now to be 
psychologically organized and presented, teachers would be 
able to drill the attention, will, memory, imagination, feel- 
ings, judgment, reasoning, ability in observation and sense 
discrimination, and other “powers of the mind,” and thus 
awaken the egoistic and social feelings, stimulate the higher 
sentiments, and develop the moral character of the children 
so taught. By such means the citizenship-aim of education 
would be realized. The mind of the child was conceived 
of as consisting of a number of more or less water-tight com- 
partments, or “faculties,” the drilling of which was the busi- 
ness of education,
-P-A-G-E-404
  366 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Courses of instruction were now much more minutely out- 
lined than before; the work for each grade was quite definitely 
laid down; the kind, amount, and order of subject-matter 
to be learned, by all pupils in all parts of the city, and regard- 
less of age, past experience, future prospects, or physical or 
mental condition, was uniformly prescribed for all; and the 
examination test at the end of the term became the almost 
uniform proof that what had been outlined had or had not 
been mastered. Such courses of study and such conceptions 
of the educational process came to be the prevailing type 
between about 1870 and 1890, and are still found here and 
there in cities and villages which have not been touched by 
the newer conceptions of education. 
Newer conceptions of educational work. From the dis- 
cussion in the preceding chapter, regarding changed social, 
industrial, and national conditions, the reader will have seen 
why such a knowledge conception of education ultimately 
must give way to newer and sounder ideas as to the nature 
and purpose of public education. To meet the newer con- 
ditions of our national life not only must the direction of 
educational effort be changed, but also the education of dif- 
ferent classes of children must take somewhat different 
directions. pete 
Beginning here and there, back in the decade of the eighties, 
and becoming a clearly defined movement after about 1900, 
new courses of study and teaching directions appeared which 
indicated that those responsible for the conduct of the school 
systems were actuated by new conceptions as to the nature 
and purpose of the educational process. Recognizing that 
the needs of society and the community were ever changing 
and growing, and that the needs of pupils, both by classes 
and individually varied much, the courses which were then 
outlined came to include alternatives and options, and to 
permit variations in the work done in different rooms and 
schools. The excess of drill which had characterized earlier 
school work came to be replaced by lessons in subjects in- 
volving expression and appreciation, such as art, music,
-P-A-G-E-405
  NEW EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTIONS 367 
manual work, domestic training, play, and humane educa- 
tion; the kindergarten and the kindergarten spirit began to 
effect changes in the character of the work of the receiving 
class and of the first grade or two of the elementary school; 
the discipline of the school everywhere became milder, and 
pupil-codperation schemes for training in self-control arose; 
subjects which prepared better for efficient participation in 
the work of democratic society, such as hygiene, community 
civics, industrial studies, and thrift, were added; the social 
relationships of the classroom and school were directed, 
through studies in conduct and manners, toward the prep- 
aration of more socially efficient men and women; and the 
commercial and industrial life of the community began to 
be utilized to give point to the instruction in manual train- 
ing, local history, civics, geography, and other related studies. 
The main duty of the teacher, under these newer courses, 
came to be that of guiding and directing the normal proc- 
esses of thought and action on the part of the pupils, of 
extending their appreciation in new directions, of connecting 
the work of the school with life in a better way, of widening 
the horizons of the thinking and the ambitious among the 
children, and of stimulating them to develop for themselves 
larger and better ideals for life and service. Instead of being 
fixed and largely finished products, this new type of courses 
of study remained plastic, to be changed in any direction 
and at any time that the best interests of the children might 
seem to require. 
The new center of gravity. The most marked change be- 
tween this newer type of course of study and the older type 
was the shifting of the center of gravity from that of the sub- 
ject-matter of instruction to that of the child to be taught. 
The children of a particular community who presented them- 
selves for education, and not the more or less traditional 
subject-matter of instruction, now came to be the real edu- 
cational problem. The school, in consequence, began to 
change from that of a place where children prepare for life 
by learning certain traditional things, to a place where chil-
-P-A-G-E-406

368 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
dren live life and are daily brought into contact with such 
real industrial, social, community, and life experiences as 
will best prepare them for the harder problems of living 
which lie just ahead. 
Viewed from the angle of child needs and child welfare the 
school became a new institution. Knowledge now came to 
be conceived of as life experience and inner conviction, and 
not as the memorization of the accumulated learning of the 
past; as a tool to do something with, and not as a finished 
product in itself. It came to be seen that facts possess but 
little real importance until they have been put to use. Child 
welfare and social welfare were perceived to be closely inter- 
twined. To train children for and to introduce them into 
membership in the little community of which they form a 
part, and from this to extend their sense of membership 
outward to the life of the State, the Nation, and to world 
civilization; to awaken guiding moral impulses; to fill them 
with the spirit of service; and to train them for effective self- 
direction; — these became the great tasks of the modern 
school. 
The teacher in the new type of school. The teacher under 
the earlier type of school was essentially a drill master and 
a disciplinarian. It was his business to see that his pupils 
learned what was set before them, and to keep order. In 
the period between 1860 and 1900 it came to be conceived 
of as the teacher’s chief function so to impart the selected 
subject-matter of instruction as to introduce it to the mind 
of the child by the most approved psychological procedure. 
The function of the teacher, though rendered much more 
important, still remained that of an instructor rather than 
that of a guide to instruction. 
While retaining both of these earlier aims as important 
— drill where drill is needed, and proper psychological pro- 
cedure in the teaching process — the newer conceptions as 
to school work went beyond either of these earlier aims. 
Both principals and teachers came to be expected to think 
over their work of instruction in the light of their local prob-  
-P-A-G-E-407
  NEW EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTIONS $69 
lems, with a view to adapting and adjusting the school work 
to the particular needs and capacities of the pupils to be in- 
structed. Teaching now becomes a finer art and a still more 
difficult psychological process than before. Individual re- 
sults, as well as group results, now were aimed at. The 
teacher proposed problems to the pupils, and then guided 
them in examining and studying them. Problems involving 
life-situations became of greatest value. In each case the 
solving became the main thing; not the memorizing of some 
one else’s solution. 
Both principals and teachers now came to stand as stim- 
uli to individual activity, as whetstones upon which those 
stimulated could bring their thinking to a keener edge, and 
as critics by whose help young people might develop their 
ability to reason accurately and well. The aim of instruc- 
tion became that of fitting young people, by any means 
suited to their needs and capacities, to meet the responsi- 
bilities of life; to train them to stand on their own feet; to 
develop in them the ability to do their own thinking; and 
to prepare them for civic and social efficiency in the na- 
tional life of to-morrow. 
The spirit of the modern school. Such, in brief, are the 
actuating motives which have come to underlie the work of 
the efficiently directed modern school. The school often falls 
far short of such ideals in the results it is able to achieve, 
but such at least, consciously or unconsciously, are the actu- 
ating motives of its work. “Its aim is not mere knowledge, 
except as knowledge will be useful; not mental discipline, 
of the drill sort, but a discipline of the whole life; not a head 
full of facts, but a head full of ideas; not rules of conduct 
learned, but the ability to conduct one’s self properly; not a 
pupil knowing civics, but one who can think over civic ques- 
tions; and not so much a learned as a well-trained output. 
Through community civics, studies in science and indus- 
try, studies of community life, the study of community 
health problems, studies of home needs, domestic science, 
manual training, drawing, music, thrift training, manners

and conduct, play and games, as well as through a reorgan- 
ization and redirection of the work in the older subjects — 
arithmetic, geography, language study, literature, history 
— the modern school aims to train pupils for greater social 
usefulness and to give them a more intelligent grasp of the 
social and industrial, as well as the moral and civic, structure 
of our modern democratic life. 
The studies which have come to characterize the modern 
elementary school may now be classified under the following 
headings: 2 
Drill Subjects Content Subjects Expression Subjects 
Reading Literature Kindergarten Work 
Writing Geography Music 
Spelling History Manual Arts 
Language Civic Studies Domestic Arts 
Arithmetic Manners and Conduct Plays and Games 
Nature Study School Gardening 
Agriculture Vocational Subjects 
The order of arrangement is not only almost the order of the 
historical introduction of the different subjects into the ele- 
mentary school, but the three groups also represent the 
three great periods of our elementary school development. 
The drill subjects characterized the earlier school; the con- 
tent subjects, excepting the last, the period of development 
between 1860 and 1890; and the expression subjects the 
modern elementary school development. 
II. Necessary ADJUSTMENTS AND DIFFERENTIATIONS 
The average child. Up to relatively recently all our 
school work has been adjusted to meet the needs of the so- 
called “average child.” As children of average capacity 
usually do reasonably well under courses of study con- 
structed with average needs in view, the results for a long 
time were not noticeably bad. Teachers tried hard to bring 
all their pupils “up to grade.” Those who could not master 
the subject-matter were in time promoted anyway, while the 
bright pupils marked time. The teacher naturally labored

most with those who had the most difficulty with their 
studies. The figure below shows the results of such instruc- 
tion in a city where the courses of study and the promotional 
plans were arranged and carried out to meet the needs of the 
great mass of the city’s children. The great bulk of the 
  Fic. 65. Promotionat Resuuts 1n 4 Crry Foniowine A Course OF

pupils, it will be seen, made normal progress, while approxi- 
mately equal percentages were ahead and behind their 
grade. In an average school of 42 pupils in that city, 6 
would be ahead of grade, 29 on grade, and 7 below grade. 
This represents what may still be said to be an average and 
a tolerably satisfactory condition. In many school systems 
the percentage of retarded pupils is much higher, and the 
number who are ahead much lower than in the school sys- 
tem here shown. 
Children whom average courses do not fit. For some of 
the children, though, it has been found that some or all of 
the school work either is too difficult, or is entirely unsuited 
to their needs. Asa result they fail to make proper progress, 
and gradually drop farther and farther behind. In the city 
shown in the diagram, 15.2 per cent of the children were in 
this class. One often finds such children two, three, or four 
years over age for their grades, and accomplishing little in 
school that is of value to them. On the other hand, for 
some children the work is entirely too easy. Such children 
can do their school work in short time and without half try- 
ing, and in consequence fall into habits of idleness by not 
 
-P-A-G-E-410
872 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
being worked to capacity. Often, too, these more capable 
children are held back by teachers, in part because their 
capacity is not recognized, and in part to keep their grade 
progress nearer to their age progress. The result is that 
they are actually retarded, even though they are “up to 
grade.” 
The effect of uniform and average courses of study on 
both classes of children has been found to be distinctly bad. 
On the one hand, the pupils who are held for years in the 
lower grades instead of advancing, too large for their seats, 
often unfit associates for the smaller children, and usually 
accomplishing little because the school work is too difficult 
for them or is not suited to their needs, are being prepared 
by the school to join the ranks of the inefficient and unsuc- 
cessful and dissatisfied in our working world. When one 
considers with what a meager life-equipment these young 
people eventually leave school, and what a poor preparation 
they have for social efficiency or intelligent citizenship, the 
bad results of unsuitable school work become evident. If 
the school can do better by these children it is its duty, as a 
social institution, to do so. To learn to succeed is one of the 
purposes of going to school. On the other hand, bright 
children are held back when they ought to be put into more 
advanced work, better suited to their needs and more likely 
to awaken their interest and enthusiasm. To learn to 
dawdle and loaf is not the purpose of education. 
We thus see that we really have at least three well-recog- 
nized groups or types of children in our schools with which 
to deal — the below-average, the average, and the above- 
average. While these three classes have in a way for a long 
time been recognized, it is only relatively recently that we 
have begun to pay any particular attention to the needs of 
the two non-average groups. For some time we continued 
to educate the average child, hoping to bring the slower 
pupil up by a little extra attention, and letting the bright 
child rather shift for himself. 
Flexible grading and promotion plans. The earliest and

  NEW EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTIONS 373 
most common attempt to remedy conditions arising from 
the discovery that uniform courses of study were not fully 
adjusted to the needs of all, was along the lines of coaching 
the backward children by an assistant teacher. This plan 
goes back to the days of the usher, or assistant teacher 
(p. 229), and in its modern form was employed by Colonel 
Parker at Quincy, Massachusetts, in the late seventies, and 
still later was more fully applied at Batavia, New York.

Showing a half-year’s progress for all pupils under this plan. The coaching of the slow 
pupils by the assistant teacher makes this equality of progress possible. In North Denver this 
plan was reversed, the assistant teacher working with the brighter pupils. (From Cubber- 
ley’s Public School Administration, p. 302.) 
The Batavia form became known, and about ten years ago 
was tried in many parts of the United States. The plan 
is well shown in the above drawing. The idea was to use 
the assistant teacher to coach the laggards and bring them 
up to grade, so that all might be promoted together. 
The next plan tried was that of breaking up the yearly 
grade system, which we had evolved, so as to make promo- 
tion easier and more frequent. The essential feature of this 
plan consisted in providing semi-annual, or even quarterly 
promotions, so that children might be advanced one half or 
one quarter of a year’s work, or be set back that amount, 
as conditions might seem to indicate as desirable. This 
provided two grades, an A and B, for each school year, and 
pupils failing of promotion need repeat only a half-year in- 
stead of a whole year of school work. Both of these ideas 
were put into use after about 1875 to 1880, and the semi- 
annual promotion has since become an established institu-

tion in our American schools. The Batavia plan has met 
with only limited favor. 
Since about 1900 the problem has been approached from a 
different angle, by the organization of what are variously 
known as supplementary classes, over-age classes, or ungraded 
classes, one or more such classes being provided for in each 
large school building. To such classes are sent the over- 
aged, the “left-overs,” those behind due to illness or ab- 
sence, those who need special coaching to enable them to 
understand some school subject or to make up some defi- 
ciencies, or those ahead and about ready to jump a grade. 
Such pupils may remain in such classes all day, or only dur- 
ing the time they are receiving extra teaching, and for only a 
few weeks or for quite a long time. For pupils for whom 
such classes are adapted they render the double service of 
instructing them better and of relieving the regular class 
_ teacher of their care. Their purpose is not only to make the 
_ graded system more flexible, and thus break up somewhat 
the so-called “lock-step’’ of the public school, but also to 
meet the needs of both the dull and the bright children, by 
providing special instruction better adapted to their stage 
of progress than is the regular instruction of the average 
school grade. Asa matter of experience the brighter chil- 
dren usually receive but little direct help from such classes, as 
they are used almost entirely for the dull or retarded pupils. 
The average pupils who remain with the grade teacher re- 
ceive better instruction because the more time-consuming 
cases have been removed from the room. 
Parallel courses of study. None of these plans, however, 
make any specific provision for the regular advancement of 
the pupils capable of going ahead much faster than the 
average. Since about 1895 the wants of this class have been 
somewhat recognized, and a number of different plans have 
been evolved and put into operation, in different parts of the 
United States, the purpose of which has been to provide 
better for the needs of the brighter pupils in the school. 
The address of President Eliot, of Harvard, before the Na-

tional Education Association, in 1892, on “Undesirable and 
Desirable Uniformity in Schools,” did much to stimulate 
thinking as to the desirability of providing better for the 
needs of the more capable children. The uniformity in 
grading and promotion he condemned as “suppressing indi- 
vidual differences instead of developing them and leaving

individual capacities undiscovered and untrained, thus rob- 
bing the individual of happiness and serviceableness, and 
society of the fruits it might have enjoyed from the special 
endowments of thousands of its members.” 
The Cambridge, Massachusetts, plan, shown in the above 
drawing, is a 1910 revision of a.still earlier plan inaugurated 
there to meet such needs as President Eliot had described. 
The essential features of it are two parallel courses of study, 
one of eight years for the average pupil, and a parallel course 
of six years in length for the gifted pupil, with natural trans- 
fer points which make it possible for a pupil to take any 
amount of time from six to eight, or even more, years to 
complete the course. The Cambridge plan is typical of a 
number of somewhat similar parallel-course plans which 
have been evolved, the purpose of all of which has been to 
enable the more capable pupils to advance more rapidly. 
Differentiated courses of study. About 1898 an exper- 
iment was begun at Baltimore, by Superintendent Van

Sickle, and about the same 
time a somewhat similar one 
was tried for a short time 
at Santa Barbara, California, 
both of which were very 
important viewed from the 
standpoint of the best inter- 
ests of our democratic life. 
Similarexperiments have since 
been tried and are still in use 
in a number of places. The 
essential idea underlying each 
is that children are’ different 
not only in mental capacity 
-but in future possibilities as 
well; that they fall roughly 
into three groups — the slow, 
the average, and the gifted; 
that a course of study for 
each group should be worked 
out which is up to but not 
beyond the capacities of the 
pupils of each group to accom- 
plish; that transfer from one 
group to the other, in either 
direction, should be easy; that 
during the first six years of 
school life the courses should 
vary in the amount of work 
done, but not in the time con- 
sumed; and that, after this 
preliminary sorting period, 
the largest possible opportu- 
nities should be given to the 
gifted group to move rapidly, 
take extra studies, and enjoy 
extra educational advantages, Intermediate

the other groups at the same time not being neglected. The 
adjoining diagram shows the nature of these plans. 
The prime idea underlying these differentiated courses 
has been that of providing better advantages for gifted 
children, and as such they are among the most interesting 
experiments for the improvement of democracy that have 
been made. No form of government is so dependent on 
intelligence as is a democracy. Instead of having leaders 
trained for us in separate schools, as in continental Europe 
(see Fig. 51, page 268), they must with us come from among 
the mass of our citizenship. A democracy, too, is especially 
in need of leaders to guide the mass, and it is from among 
its gifted children that the leaders must be drawn. The 
future welfare of this Nation depends, in no small degree, 
upon the right education of our gifted children. The de- 
gree to which our civilization moves forward depends largely 
upon the work of creative thinkers and leaders in science, 
trades, industry, government, education, art, morality, and 
religion. Moderate ability can follow, or can imitate, but 
superior ability must point the way. 
Differentiated classes and schools. The flexible-grading 
idea may be said to have become common by 1890, and 
parallel and differentiated courses of study for elementary 
pupils have been introduced almost entirely since 1900. 
Largely since 1900, too, we have seen the establishment of 
a number of special types of classes or schools to meet the 
educational needs of these different classes of children. 
Realizing that the three large groups could not include all 
classes in need of special training, our school systems have 
begun the organization of special classes to meet the peculiar 
needs of small percentages of their children. 
In a few places special classes for gifted children have been 
organized, though most of this special educational effort has 
been placed at the other end of the scale. Among such 
extra educational efforts may be mentioned classes for chil- 
dren markedly over age, these children often being ad- 
vanced into selected upper-class and high-school work be-
-P-A-G-E-416
  378 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
cause of their age, and regardless of their failure to be pro- 
moted; special classes for non-English-speaking children, 
to teach them the use of the language; ship schools, in the 
ports, to train boys for the sea, and at the same time impart 
to them a general elementary school training; industrial 
classes, where certain types of industrial work are substi- 
tuted for academic branches less useful and particularly 
difficult for such types of children; special art and music 
schools, where pupils showing special aptitude for drawing 
or music may receive special attention; and home schools, 
where girls of upper grammar-school age may receive special 
preparation for home-keeping. 
The effect of the introduction of these specialized classes 
has been to reduce waste, speed up the rate of production, 
and increase the value of the output of our schools. The 
condition of our schools before about 1890, and to a certain 
degree this condition still persists, was that of a manufactur- 
ing establishment running on a low grade of efficiency. The 
waste of material was great and the output small and costly 
— in part because the workmen in the establishment were 
not supplied with enough of the right kind of tools; in part 
because the supervision emphasized wrong points in manu- 
facture; but largely because the establishment was not 
equipped with enough pieces of special type machinery, 
located in special shops or units of the manufacturing plant, 
to enable it to meet modern manufacturing conditions. 
Since 1890, through the introduction of flexible promotions, 
parallel courses of study, differentiated courses, and special- 
type classes and schools, we have been engaged in improving 
the business by speeding it up, supplying it with new and 
specialized machinery, saving wastes, and increasing the 
tate and the value to society of the output. The public 
schools of the United States are, in a sense, a manufactory, 
doing a half-billion dollar business each year in trying to 
prepare future citizens for usefulness and efficiency in life. 
As such we have recently been engaged in applying to it 
some of the same principles of specialized production and
-P-A-G-E-417
NEW EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTIONS 379 
manufacturing efficiency which control in other lines of the 
manufacturing business. 
All these changes are significant of the great shift in direc- 
tion which has come over American education since the 
decade of the eighties. Then every one was talking about 
subject-matter, psychological procedure, and the “faculties” 
of the mind, and uniformity in educational output was the 
prevailing educational conception. The forty years which 
have elapsed, with the consequent social and industrial and 
political changes through which our Nation has passed, 
have witnessed a complete alteration in attitude, and the 
child to be educated has been brought to the front in our 
educational thinking. To-day child welfare, rather than 
subject-matter, occupies the center of the stage, while our 
educational practice is directed by a truer psychology than 
the decade of the eighties knew. 
If. Taz Epucation or DELINQUENTS 
Compulsory school-attendance legislation. In the earlier 
days of our educational development we dealt with school 
delinquents much as the Church of the time dealt with reli- 
gious delinquents. They were simply left outside the pale. 
As the Church could not be wrong and the difficulty must of 
course lie with the sinner, so the school felt itself to be right 
and the difficulty to be with the children who found the 
school unattractive and did not attend. Both Church and 
school have since seen fit to revise this judgment, as well as 
their methods of dealing with the young. 
Though Massachusetts and Connecticut had had colonial 
laws requiring school attendance, these in time fell into dis- 
use, and the first modern compulsory-attendance law was 
enacted by Massachusetts, in 1852. This required all chil- 
dren between the ages of eight and fourteen to attend school 
for twelve weeks each year, six weeks of which must be con- 
secutive. A number of other States and Territories in time 
followed Massachusetts’ lead, those before 1885 being as 
follows:

California. 
Six other Western States and Territories were added by 
1890, and by 1900 nearly all the Northern and Western 
‘States had enacted some form of a school-attendance law. 
As late as 1890, though, but one State, Connecticut, had 
required attendance at school during the entire period the 
schools were in session. All the other States had followed 
the Massachusetts plan, requiring attendance for from 
twelve to twenty weeks, only a portion of which need be 
consecutive. 
Since 1900, and due more to the activity of persons con- 
cerned with social legislation and those interested in improv- 
ing the physical and moral welfare of children than to edu- 
cators themselves, there has been a general revision of the 
compulsory education laws of our States and the enactment 
of much new child-welfare and anti-child-labor legislation. 
As a result of this the labor of young children has been 
greatly restricted; work in many industries has been pro- 
hibited entirely, because of the danger to life and health; 
compulsory education has been extended in a majority of 
the States to cover the full school year; poverty, or depend- 
ent parents, in many States no longer serves as an excuse for 
non-attendance; often those having physical or mental de- 
fects also are included in the compulsion to attend, if their 
wants can be provided for; the school census has been 
changed so as to aid in the location of children of compul- 
sory-school age; and special officers have been authorized or 
ordered appointed to assist school authorities in enforcing 
the compulsory-attendance and child-labor laws. Having
-P-A-G-E-419
   NEW EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTIONS 381 
taxed their citizens to provide schools, the States have now 
required the children to attend and partake of the advan- 
tages provided. The schools, too, have made a close study 
of retarded pupils, because of the close connection found to 
exist between retardation in school and truancy and juvenile 
delinquency. 
One result of this legislation. One of the results of all 
this legislation has been to throw, during the past quarter of 
a century, an entirely new burden on the schools. These 
laws have brought into the schools not only the truant and 
the incorrigible, who under former conditions either left 
early or were expelled, but also many children of the foreign- 
born who have no aptitude for book learning, and many 
children of inferior mental qualities who do not profit by 
ordinary class-room procedure. Still more, they have 
brought into the school the crippled, tubercular, deaf, epi- 
leptic, and blind, as well as the sick, needy, and physically 
unfit. By steadily raising the age at which children may 
leave school from ten or twelve up to fourteen and sixteen, 
our schools have come to contain many children who, having 
no natural aptitude for study, would at once, unless specially 
handled, become a nuisance in the school and tend to de- 
moralize schoolroom procedure. These laws have thrown 
upon the school a new burden in the form of public expec- 
tancy for results, whereas a compulsory-education law can- 
not create capacity to profit from education. Under the 
earlier educational conditions the school, unable to handle 
or educate such children, expelled them or let them drop 
from school and no longer concerned itself about them; now 
the public expects the school to get results with them. Con- 
sequently, within the past twenty-five years the whole atti- 
tude of the school toward such children has undergone a 
change, and an attempt has been made to salvage them and 
turn back to society as many of them as possible, trained 
for some form of social and personal usefulness. 
Enlarging the educational opportunities of the schools. 
With the recent tendency of our States to insist on the edu-
-P-A-G-E-420
382 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
cation of all children until they are sixteen years of age, and 
for all the time the schools are in session, the need for modi- 
fications in schoolroom procedure to meet the needs of the 
children thus brought in has recently become very pressing. 
The result has been not only the establishment of differen- 
tiated and parallel courses of study, and special-type schools, 
but also, in our better organized school systems, the provi- 
sion of such a large number of different types of school op- 
portunities that somewhere in the school system every boy 
and girl may find the type of education suited to his or her 
peculiar needs. Where this cannot be done locally, due to 
the small size of the school system, it should be done by the 
county or by the State. Otherwise compulsory-education 
laws will only force children into schools from which they 
will get little of value and in which they will often prove 
troublesome, with a resulting increase of over-age children, 
refractory cases, and corporal punishment, and at the same 
time defeat the social and citizenship aims of the schools. 
It may cost more to train such children properly than it 
does the so-called normal children, but it is cheaper for 
society in the long run that the schools should do it. 
Double nature of the problem. Accordingly our schools 
have undertaken to organize new types of special classes to 
meet these new educational needs, and also to redirect some 
of their older instruction. The problem is a double one — 
first, that of providing for the needs of the classes forced 
in or forced to remain; and second, that of preventing the 
development of delinquency among other children of the 
school. 
For the first class the remedy has been found largely in the 
differentiated courses of study we have just described; the 
organization of elementary industrial school work; the or- 
ganization of non-English-speaking and over-age classes; 
the liberal use of play and school gardening; training in gov- 
ernment and self-control; and particularly the use of the 
newer expression studies which involve the elements under- 
lying the trades of modern industrial society. For the sec-
-P-A-G-E-421
NEW EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTIONS 383 
   
   
                                                                       ond class of children, those who early exhibit a tendency to 
be wayward, the problem is one of weighting down the 
wrong path by making it hard to follow, and of lighting up 
the right path by giving to it the rewards and social approval 
of the school as an institution. 
New types of schools needed. In addition to the differ- 
entiations in courses and classes, and the new types of 
schools and instruction, indicated above, the handling of 
cases showing tendencies toward truancy and waywardness 
and incorrigibility involve the creation of one special type of 
class and two types of central schools. The first may be 
organized in any graded school building; the second has been 
organized in many cities, and could be organized for a 
county as a whole. The third has been organized by a few 
cities, and the need could also be met by providing a few 
state schools of the type. These may be described, briefly, 
as follows: 
1. The disciplinary class. A special class, usually organized in 
the regular school building, to which refractory children of either 
sex may be assigned for an indefinite period, in part to relieve the 
regular classroom of these troublesome cases, and in part to adjust 
the school work and discipline to the needs of such children. These 
classes are kept small, are individual in their instruction, are taught 
by particularly capable teachers, and often have benches, tools, 
and other equipment in the room for teaching some of the expres- 
sion subjects. Their purpose is to handle, in an efficient and orderly 
manner, and to turn back if possible into the main current of the 
school, those who have begun to manifest difficulty in fitting into 
the work of the ordinary class. When this cannot be done, the 
pupils may later be transferred to an industrial, or other type of 
special class or school. 
2. The parental school. To this school those who cannot be con- 
trolled in the disciplinary classes may be sent. Incorrigible pupils 
from all the schools of a county are sometimes sent to one central 
county parental school, or a city and county may unite in main- 
taining such a school. Some of these children, too, can be turned 
back into the regular current of the school, but a larger percentage 
than in the disciplinary classes will be unable to profit there. 
Many can best be directed into the next type of school.
-P-A-G-E-422
384 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
3. Central schools for peculiar boys and girls. The sexes now are 
arranged for separately, pupils are gathered into these schools 
largely on the basis of age, and without regard to school-grade 
advancement, and the effort is to discover in what lines such pecu- 
liar children may be made useful to society. Such schools empha- 
size instruction in music, industrial art, manual and domestic 
activities, play, dramatics, and group-organization and construc- 
tional and pre-vocational activities. Some of the pupils later can 
be sent to a regular trade school, public or private, while many 
will pass out into life at the end of the compulsory-school period. 
For such children instruction which leads toward such trades or 
occupations as carpentry, bricklaying, plastering, cement work, 
plumbing, electrical work, automobile repairing, and acting as 
chauffeur, gardener, waiter, baker, cook, and seamstress, has been 
found quite satisfactory. 
State industrial schools. With a few pupils all these 
types of specialized instruction will fail, and such will need 
to be committed to a state school of a reformatory type, now 
usually known as a State Industrial School. Of all children 
enrolled in public and private schools of all kinds in the 
United States, in 1918, approximately 1 in 350 was in a 
State Industrial School. In these schools the sexes, and in 
the Southern States the two races also, are usually kept in 
separate institutions. 
Reformatory education is only a century old. The first 
juvenile reform school was founded at Birmingham, Eng- 
land, in 1817, and the second was the New York House of 
Refuge, founded in 1824. But few additional schools were 
founded before 1850, but by 1900 there were 90 such schools 
in the United States, and by 1916 we had 121 state in- 
stitutions, with 49,009 boys and 12,819 girls who had been 
committed to them. Many of these were illiterate, and 
many were feeble-minded or of low mentality. With the 
latter class the public school was doomed to fail from the} 
first. 
Two types of state institutions exist. The earlier institu- 
tions were almost entirely for the older and more depraved 
children, the commitment of some crime usually being a] 
 
-P-A-G-E-423
NEW EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTIONS 885. 
prerequisite to being sent to the school. Recently other 
state institutions have been founded to handle the more 
youthful and less serious offenders, and these cover much 
the same ground as the central city schools for peculiar and 
over-age children, described above. The idea in this latter 
type of school is cure through reéducation, rather than 
confinement and punishment. 
The next step in the state system of education for delin- 
quents is the penitentiary for youthful first offenders. Such 
institutions have recently been established in a few States, 
and while not usually thought of as being part of the state 
educational system, in reality they should be so considered 
and conducted. 
IV. Tus Epucation or DEFECTIVES 
Change in public attitude. On page 271 we mentioned 
very briefly the beginnings of special instruction of the deaf, 
blind, and feeble-minded in the United States. At first the 
feasibility of such instruction was doubted, the work in 
most cases began privately, and it was some time before our 
people came to see the need for such instruction or to be 
willing to pay for it. The first institutions were small, and 
the pupils taught were commonly exhibited in public to 
show what could be done, and to awaken interest in the 
work. 
Up to about 1850 only a few States had taken up the con- 
sideration of the education of their defective children, but 
to-day the education of defectives forms so important a part 
of the state’s educational system that no book on public 
education in the United States would be considered com- 
plete without at least a brief statement regarding the origin 
and development of such special schools. The change in 
attitude toward educating such classes has come about as a 
part of the changed attitude of society on many questions 
involving human and social welfare. We now see that it is 
better for the State, as well as for the unfortunates them- 
selves, that they be cared for properly and educated, as far 
   
-P-A-G-E-424
386° EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
as can be done, for self-respect, self-support, and some form 
of social usefulness. An uneducated defective is a depend- 
ent on some one or on society, and finds but little real enjoy- 
ment in life; an educated defective usually becomes able to 
support and care for himself, and sometimes to care for 
others in addition. So convinced have we at last become of 
the value of education for defectives that our American 
States are now somewhat generally requiring the attendance 
of defectives, after certain specified ages, at a state institu- 
tion or a public-school class specialized for their training.

From a bas-relief on the monument of Gallaudet, erected by 
the deaf and dumb of the United States, in the grounds of the 
American Asylum, at Hartford, Connecticut, 
Education of the deaf. The beginnings of this work were 
made at Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817, by the Reverend 
Thomas H. Gallaudet. The school opened with seven 
pupils, and enrolled thirty-three during the year. In 1819 
Massachusetts provided for the education of twenty pupils 
at Hartford, at state expense, and New Hampshire and 
Vermont soon adopted the same policy. In 1823 Kentucky 
established the first state school for the education of the 
deaf, and Ohio followed in 1827. Each obtained teachers
-P-A-G-E-425
  NEW EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTIONS 387 
from the Hartford school. From these beginnings, the 
movement has grown until to-day all but five of our Ameri- 
can States support one or more special state schools for the 
education of the deaf. In 1916 there were 69 state schools 
for the education of the deaf in the United States, with ap- 
proximately twelve thousand pupils enrolled, and with a 
cost for maintenance of approximately $320 per pupil per 
year. In addition there is maintained at Washington the 
only institution for the higher education of the deaf in the 
world — Gallaudet College. 
Gallaudet, in establishing his Hartford school, followed 
the method he saw in France, which was the sign method. 
Among the things which Horace Mann saw in German 
lands, and commented upon favorably in his famous Seventh 
Report, was a new method of teaching the deaf. This was 
a pure oral method, using speech and lip reading, and ex. 
cluding all signs and finger spelling. Mann considered this 
method much superior to that used in the schools of the 
United States. It will be remembered that this Report was 
received with anything but an open-minded attitude (p. 278) 
and as the teachers of the deaf did not agree with Mr. Mann, 
no change took place until 1867, when the Massachusetts 
legislature established the first oral-method school in the 
United States. This created much opposition and discus- 
sion, but the method slowly made headway, and is to-day 
the one in general use with all normal-minded deaf. 
State institutions cannot conveniently receive such chil- 
dren before they are twelve years of age, whereas deaf chil- 
dren who are to learn to speak and read the lips should begin 
to receive instruction at the age of three or four. In 1869 
the first city day-school for the oral instruction of little deaf 
children in the United States was organized in Boston, and 
very appropriately named the Horace Mann School. For 
the next twenty years there was much controversy as to the 
desirability of cities establishing such schools. In 1890 the 
“American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech 
to the Deaf” was organized in New York, under the presi-

schools for the oral instruction of deaf children has been 
deep and lasting. By 1916, there were seventy-one cities in 
fifteen states which maintained, as a part of the city public 
school system, day schools where little deaf children were 
trained to speak and to read the lips, and fitted for further 
public school education and for social usefulness and happi- 
ness. The education of the deaf is one of the most difficult 
undertakings in our entire educational plan, but when suc- 
cessful the results to society are large. It has been found 
that normal-minded deaf children can be trained for any line 
of work which does not involve hearing. 
Education of the blind. The education of the blind began 
in France in 1784, England in 1791, Austria in 1804, Prussia 
in 1806, Holland in 1808, Sweden in 1810, Denmark in 1811, 
and Scotland in 1812. The first American institutions were 
opened in Boston and New York in 1832, and Philadelphia 
in 1833. All were private institutions, and general interest 
in the education of the blind was awakened later by exhibit- 
ing the pupils trained in these institutions before legislatures 
and bodies of citizens. The first book for the blind was 
printed at Paris, in 1786. In 1873 Congress began to aid 
the American Printing House for the Blind, at Louisville, 
Kentucky. Partly because of this, and partly because the 
Post-Office Department carries books for the blind free, 
America has printed more books and built up better libra- 
ries for the blind than has any other country. Practically 
all state libraries, and many city libraries, contain special 
libraries for the blind. 
As with the deaf, the object in the education of the blind| 
is to change them from dependents to self-sustaining me 
and women, and to promote their happiness as well. The 
are taught to read from books the print of which consists o! 
a series of raised points, the alphabet of which is shown op:

part in their training. The chief industries in which the 
blind eventually find employment are basketry, weaving, 
hammock-making, carpet-weaving, cordage work, mattress- 
making, upholstering, broom- and brush-making, toy-mak-

achieved in the reéducation of blinded soldiers promises to 
open up many new opportunities and lines of instruction. 
The blind showing musical talent are educated as musicians, 
organists, etc., or as piano-tuners, while still others of special 
ability become teachers and ministers. We have recently 
had a United States Senator who was blind. A century ago 
the blind were dependents, and the adult blind lived largely 
in almshouses; to-day most of the normal-minded blind care 
for themselves, and some have families of their own. The 
United States Census Reports now show relatively few 
adult blind in almshouses. 
There are at present fifty-eight state or state-aided schools 
for the blind in the United States, and three private schools. 
Ten cities also maintain one or more schools for the blind as
-P-A-G-E-428
  390 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
parts of the city school system. The first kindergarten for 
the blind was established in Germany, in 1861; and the first 
school for the colored blind by North Carolina, in 1869. 
The first public city school for the blind was established by 
New York in 1909. By 1913 this city had opened eleven addi- 
tional classes for blind children, and two classes for children 
with contagious eye diseases. The cost per pupil per year 
is about $375 in institutions, and $175 in city-school classes. 
Education of the feeble-minded. Before the nineteenth 
century the feeble-minded and idiotic were the jokes of 
society, and no one thought of being able to do anything for 
them. In 1811 Napoleon ordered a census of such individ- 
uals, and in 1816 the first school for their training was 
founded at Salzburg, in Austria. The school was unsuccess- 
ful, and closed in 1835. The real beginning of the training of 
the feeble-minded was made in France by Edouard Seguin, 
“The Apostle of the Idiot,” in 1837, when he began a life- 
long study of such people. By 1845 three or four institu- 
tions for their study and training had been opened in Swit- 
zerland and Great Britain, and for a time it was thought that 
idiocy might be cured. Gallaudet had tried to educate such 
children at Hartford, about 1820, and a class for idiots was 
established at the Blind Asylum in Boston, in 1848. The 
interest aroused resulted in the creation of the Massachu- 
setts School for Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Youth, in 1851, 
the first institution of its kind in the United States. By 
1875 seven state and two private institutions had been es- 
tablished in this country, but until about 1890 the move- 
ment for the education of the feeble-minded had made but 
little real headway. Within the past ten years, as the so- 
cial consequences of feeble-mindedness and idiocy have been 
brought to the attention of our people, a new interest in the 
institutional care of the worst cases, and the education 
within the range of their possibilities of the higher grade of 
feeble-minded children, has been awakened. As a result wel 
have to-day thirty-eight state institutions in twenty-ni 
States, and twenty-eight private institutions in fif

States, for the institutional care and education of the dis- 
tinctively feeble-minded. 
In 1867 the first city school class to train children of low- 
grade intelligence was organized in Germany, and all the 
larger cities of Germany have since organized such special 
classes. Norway followed with a similar city organization 
in 1874, and England, Switzerland, and Austria about 1892. 
In 1893, the first American city, Providence, organized 
special instruction for children of low intelligence. Boston 
and Springfield did the same in 1898, and New York City in 
1900. Since then 118 American cities, up to 1916, had or- 
ganized school classes for the segregation and training of

the higher grades of children of low mental capacity. In 
the state institutions approximately thirty-three thousand 
feeble-minded persons are being cared for, and about nine 
hundred in private institutions. The 118 cities were edu- 
cating, in special classes, 16,524 children of this type in 1916. 
As studies show that approximately two per cent of all school 
children are of such low-grade intelligence that they need
-P-A-G-E-430
392 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
special classes, and that at least two persons in each thou- 
sand are definitely feeble-minded or idiotic, it will be seen 
that but a small percentage of those who should be educated 
separately or confined in institutions are as yet under proper 
educational or institutional care. 
The education of these children was at first largely of the 
old drill-subject type, but more recently has been shifted 
largely to the expression-type of studies, with special em- 
phasis on preparation, for the higher grades of such children, 
which will fit them into the occupations mentioned under 
the heading of Central Schools for Peculiar Boys and Girls 
(p. 384). The different types of state institutions now pro- 
vided are as shown in the figure on the preceding page. 
Other types of schools for defectives. Other types of 
special classes for children suffering from defects, recently 
organized as a part of our city school systems, are: 
1. Classes for stutterers and stammerers. Pupils suffering from 
speech defects are sent to small special classes, under teachers 
specially trained for such service, and by slow and careful speech- 
training are educated to speak properly. From one to two per cent 
of all school-children would be helped by such special-class speech 
training. Such classes are common in European cities, and have 
been established in a number of American cities, since the first one 
was founded in New York, in 1909. 
2. Special schools for crippled children. The first attempt to 
educate crippled children in schools especially adapted to their 
needs was made in Munich, in 1832. The model school in Europe 
for the education of cripples was established in Copenhagen, in 
1872. The work was begun privately in New York City, in 1861. 
In 1898 the London School Board undertook to provide classes 
for crippled children. In January, 1899, the city of Chicago estab- 
lished the first public school for crippled children in the United 
States. In 1898 there was organized in New York City “The 
Guild for Crippled Children of the Poor,” and in 1900 the “Crip- 
pled Children’s East Side Free School” began work. During the 
next six years a number of other private-aid organizations also 
opened schools for crippled children, and in 1906 the New York 
City Board of Education began the organization of such special 
classes in the public schools. By 1912 the city was educating, in
-P-A-G-E-431
NEW EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTIONS 393 
23 special classes, about 450 of the estimated 18,000 crippled chil- 
dren in the city. In 1907 Massachusetts opened the first state 
institution for the care and education of crippled and deformed 
children in the United States. 
3. Open-air classes. This type of class has come in with the re- 
cent new interest in health education, it being designed to enable 
physically run-down children to continue their education and at 
the same time regain health and physical vitality. Such classes 
are held in the open air, the children are well fed and warmly clad, 
the hygienic conditions are closely supervised, and the instruction 
is carefully adjusted to the needs and capacities of the children. The 
first open-air school was organized in Berlin, in 1904, London 
opened its first open-air school in 1907, and the first in the United 
States was opened at Providence, in 1908. Boston and New York 
City opened similar schools the same year, and Chicago in 1909. 
The movement spread rapidly, and by 1912 forty-four American 
cities had organized similar special classes. The number of these 
is probably in excess of one hundred to-day. 
Tn this country the classes have so far been confined largely to 
helping tubercular children, but in the European cities much more 
has been done than with us in caring for and improving children 
suffering from various forms of physical debility and subnormal 
vitality. So far we have met the needs of but very few with such 
schools, as statistics show from three to five per cent of our school- 
children are in need of such treatment as these open-air schools 
provide.

The new interest in health. The education and care of 
tubercular children and children of low physical vitality, 
while valuable, is but a small part of the health problem 
which a modern school system has within recent years been 
called upon to face. The discovery and isolation of bac- 
teria; the vast amount of new knowledge which has come to 
us as to the transmission and possibilities for the elimination 
of many diseases; the spread of information as to sanitary 
science and preventive medicine; the change in emphasis in 
medical practice from curative to preventative and reme- 
dial; the closer crowding together of all classes of people in 
cities; the change of habits for many from life in the open te

Medical inspection and health supervision. Medical in- 
" spection of schools began in France, in 1837, though genuine 
| medical inspection, in a modern sense, was not begun in 
France until 1879. The pioneer country was Sweden, 
where health officers were assigned to each large school as 
early as 1868. Norway made such appointments optional 
in 1885, and obligatory in 1891. Belgium began the work 
in 1874. Tests of eyesight were begun in Dresden in 1867, 
Frankfort-on-Main appointed the first German school physi- 
cian in 1888. England first employed school nurses in 
1887; and, in 1907, following the revelations as to low physi- 
cal vitality growing out of the Boer War, adopted a manda- 
tory medical inspection aad health development act apply- 
ing to England and Wales, and the year following Scotland 
did the same. Argentine and Chili both instituted such 
service in 1888, and Japan made medical inspection com- 
pulsory and universal in 1898. 
~—~In the United States the work was begun voluntarily in 
Boston, in 1894, following a series of epidemics. Chicago or- 
ganized medical inspection in 1895, New York City in 1897, 
and Philadelphia in 1898. From these larger cities the ideal 
spread to the smaller ones, at first slowly, and then very 
rapidly. By 1911 as many as 411 cities had provided medi-

cal inspection, and the number to-day is probably near a 
thousand. The first school nurse in the United States was 
employed in New York City, in 1902, and the idea at once 
proved to be of great value. By 1911 as many as 415 school 
nurses had been employed in American cities, and the num- 
ber has increased very rapidly since that date. In 1906 
Massachusetts adopted the first state medical inspection 
law, and by 1911 twenty States had enacted such legisla- 
tion. In 1918 Minnesota organized the firet_ State Division 
of Healt! upervision of S ” in the United States, and 
this plan has as since been follow ved by other States. 
The recent army-draft medical examinations have given 
us a rude shock as to the physical condition of our young 
men. In the first draft, approximately one in four of the 
young men between the ages of 21 and 30, the time when a 
young man should be in the prime of physical condition, 
were rejected for the army because of physical defects 
which would incapacitate them for the life of a soldier. 
Others who were accepted have had to be placed in develop- 
ment battalions to bring them up to physical standard. 
Had our young women between the same ages been called 
up for important national duty there is reason to think that 
an even larger percentage among them would have been 
rejected. Such tests of the nation’s physical stamina are 
startling, and there is every reason to expect that these reve- 
lations as to the physical incapacity of our young men, to- 
gether with the many recent studies of rural and city health 
conditions, will give a new emphasis to constructive health 
work in our schools. 
From mere medical inspection to detect contagious dis- 
eases, in which the movement everywhere began, it was next 
extended to tests for eyesight and hearing, to be made by 
teachers or physicians, and has since been enlarged to in- 
clude physical examinations to detect hidden diseases and a 
constructive health program for the schools. 
The work has come to include eye, ear, nose, throat, and 
teeth, as well as general physical examinations; the supervi-   
   
-P-A-G-E-436
  396 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
sion of the teaching of hygiene in the schools, and to a certain 
extent the physical training and playground activities; and 
a constructive program for the development of the health 
and physical welfare of all children. The value of the work 
in reducing physical defects among school-children may be 
seen from the following:

This work can now be carried on as satisfactorily in small 
cities and in county-unit school systems as in the larger 
places, and some knowledge of health needs and some ability 
to detect disease is every year becoming increasingly impor- 
tant for teachers. Child hygiene is a new study which 
teachers need to take up. 
Play and playground activities. Closely related to the 
health supervision of our schools is the play and playground 
work of the children, itself also a recent educational develop- 
ment. Probably the first playground organized in the United 
States especially for children was provided by the Children’s 
Mission in Boston, in 1886. Two summer playgrounds 
were established privately in Philadelphia, in 1893, a sand 
garden in Providence in 1894, and a summer playground in 
Chicago in 1897. The first public organized 
in Chicago in iy ; 257 cities reported 1543 play- 
grounds as in operation, and 75 other cities known to have 
playgrounds did not report. The number has increased 
rapidly since 1911, and to-day organized play and play- 
ground directors are generally recognized necessities in the 
proper education of children. 
At first the tendency was to provide separate grounds and
-P-A-G-E-437
NEW EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTIONS 397 
management, under a city playground commission, but 
within the past eight to ten years the tendency has been to 
place the direction of playgrounds under the school depart- 
ment of the city, and to organize and schedule play as a 
regular school subject. The inclination has also been 
marked, within recent years, to get away from the German 
type of Turnen exercises, and all highly organized types of 
group games; to permit of much free play and to use play 
not only for physical development but also to develop men- 
tal and moral qualities, and above all the ability to play the 
game fairly and to lose cheerfully. It is this type of play 
which has done so much for the English boy, and which the 
German boy has never known. Still more, we now open the 
playgrounds, under paid teachers and playground directors, 
after school hours, on Saturdays and Sundays, and espe- 
cially during the long summer vacation. The value of games 
and sports in sustaining the morale and physical stamina of 
the Allied armies on the Western Front was a new demon- 
stration of the value of directed play. 
Vacation schools. Another recent educational develop- 
ment, also along the line of child welfare, has been the organ- 
ization of vacation schools. The first vacation school of 
which there is any record was held in the old First Church of 
Boston, as a private affair, in 1866. Its purpose was solely 
to get the children off the streets and under good influences. 
From 1868 to 1876 certain citizens voluntarily supported a 
vacation school at Providence, which the School Committee 
permitted to be held in one of the school buildings. In 1894 
Providence again began such schools, and in 1900 the city 
school authorities adopted them as a regular part of the city 
school system. The first city to establish vacation schools 
as a part of its city school organization was Newark, in 1885. 
In 1894 “The New York Society for Improving the Condi- 
tion of the Poor” was permitted to open four vacation 
schools in the city, and in 1897 the vacation school idea was 
adopted by the Board of Education and the schools taken 
over. In Cleveland, “The Ladies’ Aid Society of the Old 
 
-P-A-G-E-438
oe ete ee 
398 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Stone Church” established the first vacation school, in 
1895, and in 1903 these volunteer schools were taken over by 
the city. In Chicago the Associated Charities in 1896, the 
University Settlement in 1897, and the Chicago Women’s 
Clubs in 1898 opened vacation schools, and these have since 
been taken over by the city. 
Almost everywhere, prior to 1900, vacation schools had 
their beginning in the voluntary effort of philanthropic or- 
ganizations, being taken over later by the city school de- 
partment. The early beginnings of these schools reminds 
one of the early public school societies for the establishment 
of the first free schools. Within the past ten years the vaca- 
tion school idea has been accepted generally by our cities, 
and such schools are now maintained in hundreds of places. 
Begun first to take children off the streets, the idea has now 
changed to that of offering real instruction as well, though 
usually with more emphasis on the expression studies than 
is given in the regular winter schools. Manual training, 
domestic science, music, story-telling, nature-study, gar- 
dening, personal and community hygiene, local history and 
geography, excursions on Saturdays, play, swimming, and 
marching and drills occupy a large part of the instruction. 
The term is usually six weeks, though there was a noticeable 
tendency, after 1915, to extend the term to cover the entire 
summer vacation period, thus organizing the schools on an 
all-year four-quarter basis. Cleveland, Gary, and a few 
other places definitely provided such all-year schools. In 
many places the high school work has been extended as 
well, and either a six-weeks review school or a summer 
quarter has been provided. 
School gardening. This is another recent activity under- 
taken by the school. The work began as an economic meas- 
ure in Germany, in the first half of the nineteenth century, 
and was in time adopted quite generally by the state school 
systems of the different European nations, largely as a food- 
production measure. France and Denmark have in the past 
forty years made wonderful successes with such instruction.
-P-A-G-E-439
NEW EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTIONS 399 
In this country the movement is little more than two decades 
old. The first school garden with us was the Wild Flower 
Garden, established at Roxbury, Massachusetts, in 1891. 
The gardens established, in 1897, by the National Cash 
Register Company, of Dayton, Ohio, for the children of its 
employees, were among the first real school gardens in this 
country. At first, school officials saw little in the idea, and 
practically all gardens organized before about ten years ago 
were by private agencies. Only since about 1910 have the 
public schools become interested in the idea as an educa- 
tional undertaking. After the outbreak of the World War, 
and the increasing world-wide scarcity of food which fol- 
lowed, the National Food Administration began an energetic 
campaign to stimulate the organization of school gardens as 
a food-production measure. In 1918 the United States 
Bureau of Education appointed a national organizer of 
school gardens, and an Educational Land Army of boys and 
girls was formed, under command of the President of the 
United States. The impetus thus given to the establish- 
ment of these gardens, together with the many valuable edu- 
cational aspects of the work, promise to make school gar- 
dening with us, a new elementary school subject of large 
importance. 
School gardening comes in naturally as a phase of the va- 
cation school work, described above, as the gardens planted 
in the spring can be cared for during the summer as a part 
of the work of the vacation school. Wholly aside from the 
money-value and food-production aspects of the work, now 
most emphasized, the work makes a strong appeal from a 
purely educational point of view. To many city children it 
is almost the only contact they ever get with nature; to 
some it is a type of education in which they become deeply 
interested; and to many it means good and healthful exer- 
cise, under proper conditions, in the fresh air and sunshine. 
The nature-study value of the observation of how plants 
germinate, grow, and mature; the lessons in social codpera- 
tion which gardening cau be made to teach; the industrial

experience coming from the money value of the products 
raised; the efforts to excel developed by competition in pro- 
duction; the withdrawal of children from the games and 
vices of the streets; and the possibilities offered by the work 
for carrying over a vacation-school interest, — all are fea- 
tures of the school gardening movement which are of much 
moral and social as well as educational value. 
VI. SteniFICANCE oF THIS WorK 
It will have been noted that all the extensions of educa- 
tional effort which we have described in this chapter are 
recent in origin, both with us and in other parts of the world. 
The oldest of these special efforts, that of the education of 
the deaf, goes back less than a century, while the great de- 
velopment of state institutions for the education of delin-. 
quents and defectives has come since The earlier 
interest in defectives may, in a general way, be said to have 
been a phase of the great humanitarian movement which 
followed the Napoleonic wars, and found expression in edu- 
cation, poor relief, workingmen’s societies, the protection 
of children, and anti-slavery propaganda. 
Beginning about 1875 to 1880, and not becoming promi- 
nent until after about 1890 to 1900, a new interest in edu- 
cation and child welfare has become evident in all lands hav- 
ing what may be called an advanced type of civilization. 
The new interest is less humanitarian than the earlier, and 
is more an outgrowth of the changed conditions in the na- 
tional life. There is a new consciousness of social needs, in 
part a truer Christian conception of one’s duty to his fellow 
men, and a new feeling of need for the transformation of all 
possible dependents into independent members of society. 
The result has been a great expansion of public educational 
effort, as shown in the chart given opposite. In addition, with 
us, the new interest in providing so many new types of edu- 
cational effort has arisen in large part because our American 
communities have come to see that, having committed them- 
selves to the idea of educating all children, it is only fair and   } In.

wise that there should be provided such a variety of schools, 
Fos classes, and courses that every boy and girl may obtain in 
an our schools, local or state, an education of such a type as 
| each can use to the greatest personal and social advantage. 
The fact that we have recently come to see that many differ- 
ent types of schools and classes are required to provide ade- 
quately for the needs of all has been felt to be no reasonable 
ground for discrimination between children. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. Explain what you understand is meant by a “faculty psychology,” 
and show the educational consequences of such a conception. 
2, What is meant by pupil-codperation schemes for training in self-con- 
trol? 
8. Contrast the earlier book-knowledge conception of education and the 
newer child-to-be-educated conception. 
4. Contrast the knowledge-as-experience conception with the know- 
ledge-as-memorized-learning conception of education. 
5. Contrast the training and work of a teacher in these two types of 
schools. 
6. State the dominating ideas of the modern school. 
7. State the advantages and disadvantages of “average courses” of 
study. 
8. In what way are over-age and retarded children being prepared to 
join the ranks of the unsuccessful and dissatisfied of our working 
world? 
9. Does a uniform literary-type course of study tend to awaken ambitions 
which can never be fulfilled? Why? 
10. Do differentiated courses and schools tend to prevent such disap- 
pointments, and if so, how? ‘ 
11. Show that President Eliot’s contention in his 1912 address was or 
was not correct. 
12. Show how the breakdown of the old apprentice system has (a) made 
the educational problem more difficult, and (b) caused us to raise 
the compulsory school age. 
13. Show how the increase of immigration has made compulsory attend- 
ance more necessary, and also compelled an enlargement of educa- 
tional opportunity. 
14. How do you account for the recent great interest in the education of 
delinquents and defectives? 
15. Contrast the educational results of play and the lack of it, with Amer- 
ican and English boys on the one hand, and German boys on the 
other.

Great recent development. The diagram, on page 192, 
showing the development of the Latin grammar school, 
academy, and high school; and the map on page 198, show- 
ing the high schools established by 1860, alike indicate 
the slow development of the free public high school in the 
United States. Though begun in 1821, the public high 
school, up to 1860, had made but little headway except in 
regions where New England people had gone. The Civil 
War checked further development for two_ decades, but 
after about 1880 to 2 TBEE a rapid growth of the American high school began. | While no accurate figures are available, 
there were probably about 500 high schools in the United 
States by 1870, about 800 by 1880 (in cities 244), while by 
1890, the first year for which complete statistics were col- 
lected by the United States Bureau of Education, the num- 
ber was 2526. Since then the development has been as

408 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Unlike the developmentbefore 1860, the recent marked 
increase in the number of high schools has’ been true of all 
parts of our country, West as well as East, and South as 
well as North. Before 1900 the development was more 
marked in the North; since 1900 in the South and West. 
The period up to 1860, and to a certain extent up to about 
1880, was an experimental period. The new school had to 
find its work and become established, and the people had to 
grow accustomed to the idea of the support of higher schools 
as a proper function of a democratic State. By 1880 not 
only had we at last become convinced as to the need of ex- 
tending education upward, for democratic ends, but by that 
time the industrial and social changes coming in our national 
life were making it evident that the further development and 
progress of our democracy would be seriously hampered un- 
less the amount of education extended to our youths was 
both materially increased and changed in character. Since 
about 1885 to 1890 our people generally seem to have ac- 
cepted the idea that a secondary school education, at public 
expense, should be placed within the reach of as many of 
our youth as is possible. After about this time legal and 
legislative objection to the establishment of high schools 
largely ceased, and many new laws providing for union 
schools and taxation for support appear on the statute books 
of our States. 
Change in character of the school. Along with this rapid 
development of the high school—in number of schools, 
teachers, @ nts, and the superseding of the old acad- 
emy and the private high school by tax-supported institu- 
tions under public contre!— has also come a marked change 
in the character of the high school itself. The course of 
study, before_1860, was essentially a book-study course, 
usually three years in length, and the same for all students. 
Reading, Mellen gocesashy- aaHTTetE, Bookkeeping, his- 
tory and Constitutien-of the United States, and English 
grammar, all of which have since been dropped back into the 
upper grades of the-eleméntary school, were commonly 
   
-P-A-G-E-449
eT ee a RE ee RO ere a

taught in the high schools before 1860. In addition, ancient 
and modern history, rhetoric, logic, intellectual and moral 
philosophy; aaa tural philosophy, astronomy, algebra, geom- 
etry, trigono: ; Latin, and Greek were usually included. | 
This list of let a well as the floor plans of 
the high school buildings of the time (see floor plans for the 
Providencé school, page 195, which are typical), show that 
the high sehoot-wasessentially a place to study and recite. 
While not-eriginaly—begun with the idea of preparing 
young people for college (see statement of purposes in estab- 
lishing the high schools in Boston and New York, page 191), 
this soon became one of the important purposes of our high 
schools, thus making of them a part of our educational lad- 
der and the transition institution between the common 
school and the college. Up to the time of the Civil War, 
however, but eight high school subjects (page 234) had found 
a place in the entrance requirements of the colleges of the 
time, and but six more were added up to 1875. Since then 
the number has been greatly increased by adding new high- 
school subjects to the list. Of the fourteen accepted by 
1875, but two — physical geography (1870) and physical 
science (1872) — were other than book and recitation sub- 
jects, and for some time both of these were taught from text- 
books and without laboratory equipment. Since 1890 
laboratory science, and since 1900 manual, domestic, and 
agricultural subjects, have found a large place in the college- 
entrance list. 
Development of new courses and schools. After about 
1880 the introduction of new subjects was so rapid that the 
old course of study became overcrowded, resulting in: 
(a) the extension of the high school course to four years; 
(6) the introduction of options and electives in the course; and 
(c) the creation of a number of parallel four-year courses, such 
as 
(1) the ancient classical course; 
(2) the modern classical course; 
(3) the English-history course;  
-P-A-G-E-450
A 
  410 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
(4) the scientific course; 
(5) the business course; 
<6) the manual arts course; 
(7) the household arts course; 
(8) the agricultural course; 
(9) the teacher-training course; 
(10) special vocational courses. 
In addition to this multiplication of courses, in many cases 
separate high schools for teaching some one or more of the 
courses given above have also been developed, with the 
result that we have to-day: 
(1) The general culture high school, being the successor, though 
now greatly modified both in subject-matter and spirit, of the 
original general high school. 
(2) The cosmopolitan high school, offering in one building, or 
group of buildings, many or all of the different courses of study 
mentioned above. 
(3) The manual-training high school, first begun as a part of 
our public school system in 1884 (page 324), but now more com- 
monly developed in connection with (2). 
(4) The household-arts high school, usually provided for as a 
course under (2) or (3), but sometimes organized separately. 
(5) The commercial high school, for training for business life. 
Begun as a separate course in many high schools in the seventies. 
Since 1898 a number of commercial high schools have been organ- 
ized in the more important of our commercial cities. 
(6) The agricultural high school, first established in connection 
with the University-of Minnesota, in 1888. By 1898 there were teri Such schools in the United States. Since 1900 the development of the agricultural high schools has been more rapid than has been 
Ke the case with any other previous type_of high school. By 1909 
there were 60-separate agricultural high schools, and agricultural 
courses were offered in 346 other high schools. The number of 
high schools to-day offering agricultural instruction is probably in 
excess of one thousand. 
(7) Trade and industrial schools, of high-school grade, for vocar 
tional training. ‘This represents our most recent development. 
With national aid for such schools and courses, this type of school 
promises to increase very rapidly. 
 
-P-A-G-E-451

NEW DIRECTIONS OF EFFORT 411 
Experience has shown that in some places and cases it is 
better that one or more of the above types of special high 
schools exist separately, while in other cases it is better that 
such courses be combined in what is now commonly spoken 
of as the cosmopolitan American high school. In their be- 
ginnings new types of education often prosper better if or- 
ganized in separate schools; after the work has been estab- 
lished, and accepted as a legitimate form of educational 
effort. it has been found wise to combine a number of differ- 
ent types of education in one school, thus enabling the high 
school to offer to each pupil a wider range of choice in stud- 
ies. The American high school, unlike the secondary school 
of Europe, is preéminently a place for trying out young 
people, developing tastes, testing capacities, opening up life 
opportunities, and discovering along what lines pupils show 
enough special aptitude to warrant further education and 
training. The same principles that apply to the differentia- 
tion of elementary school courses to meet individual needs, 
as stated in the preceding chapter, apply with even greater 
force to pupils between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. 
This involves freedom from hard and fixed courses of study, 
a rich and varied offering of courses from which to select, 
and intelligent guidance of pupils toward preparation for a 
life of useful service. 
New conceptions as to educational needs. As our civili- 
zation grows in complexity, as the ramifications of our social 
and industrial life become more extended, as production 
becomes more specialized and the ability to change voca- 
tions more limited, as our political life becomes wider and 
the duties and obligations of citizenship more important, as 
our place in world affairs becomes larger, and as the privi- 
leges conferred and the responsibility for proper living rest- 
ing on each individual in society increase, the nature and 
extent of the education offered as preparation for life must 
correspondingly increase. An education which was en- 
tirely satisfactory to meet the needs of the simpler form of 
our social and industrial national life of the sixties or the 
   
-P-A-G-E-452
  412 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
eighties is utterly inadequate for the complex life of the 
twentieth century. All this has come to be generally recog- 
nized to-day, and in consequence our American States are 
providing for the further establishment of more high schools 
and new types of high schools, extending the compulsory 
school age upward, and offering the advantages of secondary 
education to as many of our children as can advantageously 
use what the schools have to give. 
IL. Taz DevetopMent of VocatTionaL Epucation 
Vocational education in Europe and the United States. 
For more than half a century the leading countries of West- 
ern Europe, in an effort to readjust their age-old apprentice-_ 
ship system of training to modern conditions of manufacture, 
have given careful attention to the education of stich of 
their children as were destined for the vocations of the in- 
dustrial world. Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and France 
have been leaders, with Germany most prominent of all. 
No small part of the great progress made by that country in 
securing world-wide trade, before the World War, was due to 
the extensive and thorough system of vocational education 
worked out for German youths. The marked economic 
progress of Switzerland during the past quarter-century has 
likewise been due in large part to that type of education 
which would enable her, by skillful artisanship, to make the 
most of her very limited resources. France has profited 
greatly, during the past half-century also, from vocational 
education along the lines of agriculture and industrial art. 
In Denmark, agricultural education has remade the nation 
since the days of its humiliation and spoliation at the hands 
of Prussia. 
In the United States but little attention has been given to 
educating for the vocations of life until within the past ten 
years, though modern manufacturing conditions had before 
this destroyed the old apprenticeship type of training. En-

ing thrown into severe 
competition for interna- 
tional trade, and able to 
sell our products to na- 
tions anxious to buy them 
and willing to come for 
them in their own ships, 
we have not up to recently 
felt any particular need 
for anything other than a 
good common-school edu- 
cation or a general high- 
school education for our Fic. 73. Tue Dusrruction or THE

Beginnings of vocational education with us. Largely 
within the past ten years, due in part to our expanding com- 
merce and increasing competition in world trade, in part to 
the new educational impulses arising out of our new world 
position following the Spanish-American War, in part to 
the increasing world-wide demand for foodstuffs and manu- 
factured articles, and in part to a growing realization of the 
many advantages that would accrue to us as a nation and 
to our workers as individuals if we were to provide better 
and more specific types of education for those who are to 
labor, we have at last turned our attention in a really serious 
manner to the many problems surrounding the establish- 
ment of schools of secondary grade for the vocational edu- 
cation of our workers.

414 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Due to our early national importance in agriculture, and 
the endowment in each State of a college of agriculture by 
the Federal Government, in 1862 (page 210), it was natural 
that in this country agricultural education for pupils of high 
school age should have been the first of the vocational sub- 
jects to be developed. The first publicly-supported agri- 
cultural high school, as was stated above, was founded in 
1888, and since 1900 instruction in agriculture has become 
an established feature of American school life. In several 
of our American States, as for example Alabama, Georgia, 
Virginia, Oklahoma, and Massachusetts, a number of state 
agricultural high schools have been established by the legis- 
lature. In other States, among them Wisconsin, Michigan, 
and Maryland, county high schools of agriculture have been 
established, and these receive state aid for support. Many 
of the agricultural colleges also maintain an agricultural 
high school as a part of their work, and a number of cities 
have recently added courses in agriculture to their high 
schools. Still more, instruction in elementary agriculture 
has, largely in the past fifteen years, been added by law to 
the courses of instruction in the rural and village schools in 
many of our States. 
The first trade school in the United States was established 
privately in New York City, in 1881, and by 1900 some half- 
dozen schools of the trade or industrial type had been estab- 
lished privately in different parts of the country. Due in 
part to the whole idea being new, and in part to the sus- 
picion of organized labor that such schools were not being 
founded for any purpose favorable to them, the develop- 
ment of trade education came slowly. 
The National Commission on Vocational Education. The 
fifteen years from 1902 to 1917 was a period of investigation, 
discussion, and growing interest. Commercial bodies and 
manufacturers’ organizations sent school and business ex- 
perts to Europe to investigate and report on the work of 
vocational schools in the different European nations; state 
commissions made investigations and reports; and much 
 
-P-A-G-E-455
NEW DIRECTIONS OF EFFORT 415 
propaganda work was done by volunteer societies interested 
in establishing vocational education. In 1906 Massachu- 
setts led the way by creating a State Commission on Indus- 
trial Education, with power to superintend the creation and 
maintenance of industrial schools for boys and girls, and 
appropriated state aid therefor. In 1907 Wisconsin enacted 
the first trade-school law, authorizing the creation of indus- 
trial schools by the cities of the State. The Milwaukee 
School of Trades, established earlier, now was taken over 
and made a part of the city school system, and a number of 
trade schools were established in other cities. In 1909 New 
York similarly permitted the organization of trade schools 
in cities. Back in 1902 the Manhattan Trade School for 
Girls had been organized privately in New York City, and 
the work of this school did much to awaken public interest 
in trade education. In 1910 it was made a part of the free 
public school system of the city. 
Had we depended upon isolated state and local action, 
though, it would have been at least a generation, and prob- 
ably longer, before anything approaching a national system 
of vocational education would have been evolved. Realizing 
the slow rate of local action, those interested in the move- 
ment urged the creation at once of a national system of 
vocational schools, with national aid to the States for their 
maintenance. The Davis bill of 1907, and the Page bill of 
1912, were unsuccessful attempts to secure national en encour- 
agement for the mo movement, Finally Congress, in 1913, 
provided for a Presidential Commission to investigate the 
maiter_and to report on the desirability and feasibility of 
national aid for the promotion of vocational training. After 
a careful investigation this commission reported, in June, 
1914, and submitted a plan for gradually increasing national 
aid to the States to assist them in developing and maintain- 
ing what will virtually become a national system of agricul- 
tural, trade, and vocational education. 
The commission’s findings. The commission found that 
there were, in 1910, in round numbers, 12,500,000 persons

   engaged in agriculture in the United States, of whom not 
over one per cent had had any adequate preparation for 
farming; and that there were 14,250,000 persons engaged in 
manufacturing and mechanical pursuits, not one per cent of 
whom had had any opportunity for adequate training. In 
the whole United States there were fewer trade schools, of 
all kinds, than existed in the little German kingdom of 
Bavaria, a State about the size of South Carolina; while the 
one Bavarian city of Munich, a city about the size of Pitts- 
burgh, had more trade schools than were to be found in all 
the larger cities of the United States, put together. The 
commission further found that there were 25,000,000 persons 
in this country, eighteen years of age or over, engaged in 
farming, mining, manufacturing, mechanical pursuits, and in 
trade and transportation, and concerning these the Report 
said: 
If we assume that a system of vocational education, pursued 
through the years of the past, would have increased the wage- 
earning capacity of each of these persons to the extent of only ten 
cents a day, this would have made an increase of wages for the 
group of $2,500,000 a day, or $750,000,000 a year, with all that 
this would mean to the wealth and life of the nation. 
This is a very moderate estimate, and the facts would probably 
show a difference between the earning power of the vocationally 
trained and the vocationally untrained of at least twenty-five 
cents a day. This would indicate a waste of wages, through lack 
of training, amounting to $6,250,000 every day, or $1,875,000,000 
for the year. 
The commission estimated that a million new young peo- 
ple were required annually by our industries, and that it] 
would need three years of vocational education, beyond th 
elementary school age, to prepare them for efficient serv: 
ice. This would require that three million young people o! 
secondary school age be continually enrolled in schools offer: 
ing some form of vocational training. This is approxi 
mately three times the number of young people to-day en: 
rolled in all public and private high schools in the Uni'
-P-A-G-E-457
NEW DIRECTIONS OF EFFORT 417 
States. In addition, the untrained adult workers now in 
farming and industry also need some form of adult or exten- 
sion education to enable them to do more effective work. 
The commission further pointed out that there were in this 
country, in 1910, 7,220,298 young people between the ages 
of fourteen and eighteen years, only 1,032,461 of whom were 
enrolled in a high school of any type, public or private, day 
or evening, and few of those enrolled were pursuing studies 
of a technical type. True to our ancient traditions, our high 
schools were still largely book-study schools, preparing for 
political activity and the learned professions, and not for the 
vocations in which the majority of men and working women 
must earn their living. Continuing, the commission said: 
At present this vast body of over seven million youths represents 
on the whole an untrained army, needing vocational training to 
make it efficient. It has been estimated that the total cost of 
bringing a child from birth to the age of 18 is $4000, or $220 per 
year, of which about $60 per year comes from the State. If we 
assume that it would require on the average an additional outlay 
of $150 per person to prepare each properly for usefulness, so that 
society might realize more fully upon its vocational and civic possi- 
bilities, certainly no business man would hesitate for a moment to 
thus secure the protection of the sum of $4000. 
Since commercial prosperity depends largely upon the skill and 
well-being of our workers, the outlook for American commerce in 
competition with our more enterprising neighbors, under present 
conditions, is not very promising. 
It is even more short-sighted of the State and Nation to neglect 
these investments, since national success is dependent not alone on 
returns in dollars and cents, but in civic and social well-being. 
The Smith-Hughes Bill. Bills to carry out the recom- 
mendations of the commission were at once introduced in 
both branches of Congress, in the Senate by Senator Hoke 
Smith, in the House by Representative Hughes. Presi- 
dent Wilson early expressed himself as favoring the pro- 
posed legislation. After some delay, due in part to the 
outbreak of the World War, the bill was finally passed, and 
approved by the President on February 23, 1917.

The law provided for the creation of a Federal Board for 
Vocational Education; acceptance of the law by the States; 
national aid to the States for the salaries of teachers in the 
schools created, which aid the States must duplicate, dollar 
for dollar; federal supervision of work and expenditure; and 
national studies and investigations regarding needs in agri- 
culture, home economics, industry, trade, commerce, and 
courses of instruction. The courses must be given in public 
schools; must be for those over fourteen years of age, and 
be of less than college grade; and must be primarily intended 
for those who are preparing to enter or have entered a trade 
or useful industrial pursuit:\ Both full-time and part-time 
classes are provided for. 
The national aid is divided into four funds, as follows: 
1. For the purpose of codperating with the States in paying the 
salaries of teachers, supervisors, and directors of agricultural sub- 
jects, to be allotted to the States in the proportion which their 
tural population bears to the total rural population of the United 
States. 
2. For the purpose of codperating with the States in paying the 
salaries of teachers of trades, home economics, and industrial sub- 
jects, to be allotted to the States in the proportion which their 
urban population bears to the total urban population of the 
United States. 
8. For the purpose of codperating with the States in preparing 
teachers, supervisors, and directors of agricultural subjects and 
teachers of trade and industrial and home economics subjects, to 
be allotted to the States in the proportion which their population 
bears to the total population of the United States. 3 
4. For making or codperating in studies, investigations, and 
reports as to needs and courses in agriculture, home economics, 
trades, industries, and commerce. 
The sums appropriated by Congress increase each year 
for nine years, when the maximum will be reached, and are 
as shown in the accompanying table. The bill has met with 
general acceptance everywhere, and promises in a decade to 
give us a really national system of vocational training. In 
all probability, before 1926 is reached, the work will have so

The American high school, as a result of nearly a century 
of progress and evolution, now has evolved into an Ameri-

but with the growing complexity of industrial society and
-P-A-G-E-460

the minute subdivision of the old trades, vocational guidance 
has recently assumed an entirely new importance. The 
idea underlying it is not primarily to find jobs for young 
people, but rather to provide parents and pupils with in- 
formation as to the demands and opportunities in the differ- 
ent life careers, and the best means of preparing for and 
entering them. The real purpose is to sort out capacities 
and adaptabilities, to prolong preparation in school, and to 
steer young people away from vocations for which they have 
no natural aptitude and from essentially “blind-alley 
occupations.”

The movement is quite recent, going back scarcely beyon 
1907, when a bureau for advising young men in the choice o! 
a vocation was opened in Boston. In 1909 this grew int 
a Vocational Bureau, which soon became connected in it 
work with the public schools, business houses, and manu 
facturing establishments. Lectures as to careers were give! 
to the upper classes in the elementary schools; printed mat 
ter as to vocations was distributed; vocational counselor:
-P-A-G-E-461
  NEW DIRECTIONS OF EFFORT 421 
were appointed in all the schools, and pupil record-cards 
were made out. Boston soon became the center of the move- 
ment, and from there it has spread rapidly all over the United 
States. By 1910 thirty-five cities were at work on the idea. 
To-day it is an educational conception accepted generally, 
and schools everywhere are thinking and acting on the idea. 
The study of life-careers for boys and girls has been intro- 
duced into many schools, and intelligent planning for one’s 
life-work has been emphasized. Instead of leaving school 
and accepting the first job that offers, regardless of adapta- 
bility or the future it may hold or its influence on life and 
health, the attempt is made to save boys and girls from mis- 
takes before it is too late to change. In giving such guidance 
the school is not only making its own education more effec- 
tive, but is also protecting society from the dangers that 
arise when adults find themselves in work for which they 
have no aptitude and in which they cannot support a family.

Evening schools. The first evening school in the United 
States was established in Louisville, as early as 1834. Bal- 
timore organized six evening schools as early as 1840. In 
1847 the new Board of Education for New York City (p. 178) 
was permitted by law to organize evening schools for males, 
as well as day schools, and similar permission was extended 
for females, in 1848, and to Brooklyn, in 1850. The 
first general state law for evening schools was enacted by 
Ohio, in 1839, and evening schools were opened in Cincin- 
nati the following year. Massachusetts followed with a 
similar optional law in 1847. In 1855 Cincinnati also 
opened evening schools for girls. The first public evening 
high school was opened in Cincinnati, in 1856, and similar 
schools were opened in New York City in 1866, Chicago and 
St. Louis in 1868, Philadelphia in 1869, and Boston in 1870. 
By 1870 there were 60 public evening high schools in the 
United States, and a number of evening elementary schools. 
By 1881 32 cities were providing evening schools; by 1900,
-P-A-G-E-462

165; by 1909, 233; and by 1916 the number had increased to 
458, with 647,861 pupils enrolled. That even this number 
makes as yet no adequate provision for the education of our 
approximately 10,000,000 young people between the ages of 
fourteen and twenty may be seen from the following chart.

Fic. 76. Scooot ATTENDANCE oF AMERICAN CHILDREN, FouRTEEN TO 
Twenty Years or Acr 
Based on an estimate made by the United States Bureau of Education in 1907 (Bulletin No. 1, 1907, p. 29), and based on conditions then existing. Since the World War the per- centage not in any school doubtless has increased. In evening schools all classes are counted, — public, private, Y.M.C.A., Y.W.C.A., ete. Public and private day schools, both elemen- tary and secondary, also are counted. 
Originally evening schools were begun to provide educa- 
tion for those unable to attend during the day, and such 
continued to be their important function up to about 1900. 
Since that time, however, the evening school, both elemen- 
tary and high, has been greatly expanded and materially 
changed in character. With the more general enforcement 
of compulsory education, the urgent need for providing 
duplicate elementary schools for children at work during the’ 
day has in large part disappeared, as such children are now
-P-A-G-E-463
NEW DIRECTIONS OF EFFORT 423 
   
   
                                                                   required to attend day elementary schools until they are 
fourteen to sixteen years of age. In consequence, evening 
elementary schools are now chiefly useful, in States enforcing 
a good compulsory-education law, in providing the foreign- 
born with the elements of an English education. As this 
change has come, the evening high schools have grown 
vastly in importance. While continuing to offer cultural 
studies for those who have completed the elementary schools 
and wish, while working, to continue study, they have now 
largely become schools for study along scientific, technical, 
home arts, commercial, and industrial lines. A few use the 
evening high schools to prepare for entrance to college or a 
technical school, but the large majority attend them to at- 
tain greater efficiency in the occupations in which they are 
engaged. Technical, home arts, trade, and business studies 
are in greatest demand. The enactment of the Smith- 
Hughes bill is certain to result in a further marked expan- 
sion of the evening high school along vocational lines. Such 
studies as applied mathematics, navigation, mechanical 
drawing, machine design, engineering subjects, physics, 
chemistry, the various trades, automobile work, salesman- 
ship, home economics, accounting, business management, 
and similar studies, now hold a prominent place in evening 
high school work. 
By way of illustration, one city of 65,000 inhabitants, 
located in the upper Mississippi Valley, offered the following 
work in its evening vocational school in 1917-18:

Adult education. Compared with England and France, 
the United States has as yet done but little with adult educa- 
tion. What has been done has been chiefly along the lines 
of evening school classes for adults, evening lectures in the 
schoolhouses on topics of general interest, some efforts here 
and there at the elimination of adult illiteracy, farmers’ in- 
stitutes conducted by the agricultural colleges, and some 
university extension work by the state universities. What 
has been done so far, though, marks but a beginning of 
what the coming decade is certain to demand as new phases 
of the educational service. As new national needs arise, the 
conception of public education must broaden to meet them. 
Some of the more important phases of recent educational 
extension may be mentioned. 
Adult illiterates. The World War brought seriously to 
our attention what our Census statistics had for some time 
been showing, viz. that we have among us a large body of 
illiterate adult males who possess little or no ability to use 
the English language. Many, though naturalized, we now 
find know and care little for us or our democratic institutions 
and government. The chart showing the nativity of the 
foreign-born in 1910 (p. 837) reveals something of the char-

acter of the immigrants we have among us. The two circu-

particularly agreeable one. Still more, the problem is worst 
in our large cities, where assimilation is most difficult. The 
Census of 1910 showed that, for the ten largest cities of the 
country, the percentage of the population in each which 
could not speak English was as follows:

additional number could understand so little as scarcely to    
   
-P-A-G-E-466
426 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
be able to follow commands. Such conditions are a serious 
menace to our national welfare. 
While providing schooling for such of the children of the 
foreign-born as choose to attend public rather than parochial 
schools, we have, through all our history, left to chance the 
Americanization of the adults. The outbreak of the World 
War, and the beginning of hostile propaganda among our 
people by the agents of Germany and Austria-Hungary, 
brought forcibly to our attention the fact that we have for’ 
long reposed in a false security. A long list of strikes among 
foreign-born colonies in our munition factories; “accidents” 
and explosions on docks and ships; the burning of barns and 
crops; the formation of “leagues” and “societies” inter- 
ested in other than our national welfare; meetings of alien 
races for racial ends; the new prominence of the I.W.W.; the 
prominence given to the hyphen by the German-Americans, 
Trish-Americans, and others; the activity of the foreign- 
language press, and even the traitorous nature of some of 
the newspapers previously regarded as American; — these 
and many other happenings led us quickly to see that we 
had in the past been very negligent, and that we are now 
facing a vast social problem involving our national security 
and unity and the preservation of our national ideals. Na- 
tional safety and national welfare alike demand that our 
schools now engage in a systematic and organized en- 
deavor to educate the foreign-born in the principles and 
ideals of our democracy, and to make English our one com- 
mon tongue. In a recent bulletin on the subject the danger 
was well stated in the following words: 
The government of the United States is a government by repre- 
sentation, and its integrity and effectiveness depend upon the intel- 
ligence of all the people. This intelligence rests mainly upon the 
easy transfer of thought and information from one person to an- 
other by means of the spoken word and the printed page. In an 
illiterate community the sense of civic responsibility is at its lowest, 
and disease, social isolation, and industrial inefficiency are found 
in highest degree.
-P-A-G-E-467
NEW DIRECTIONS OF EFFORT 427 
It is difficult for those who can read easily to form even a bare 
conception of the mental limitations of the illiterate, the near- 
illiterate, and the non-reader. It is still harder to appreciate the 
material handicaps to earning a livelihood entailed by illiteracy. 
While illiteracy does not necessarily imply ignorance, it does predi- 
cate lack of information, comprehension, and understanding. It 
increases prejudice, suspicion, and passion, and diminishes natural 
appreciation and power to codperate; yet codperation is the essence 
of modern civilization, and inability to codperate is the basis of 
race hatred. So that illiteracy is clearly a topic for national solici- 
tude, and its eradication a proper subject for governmental action. 
Citizenship classes. In 1915-16, under the lead of the 
United States Bureau of Education, our cities made the 
beginnings, through their adult citizenship classes, of what 
now seems destined to 
grow into a great cam- 
paign for the better as- 
similation of the adult 
foreign-born, and the 
stamping-out not only 
of illiteracy, but of the 
lack of ability to use 
and understand the 
English language as 
well. We have in the 
past cared little as to

those still owing alleg-

requirements for naturalization, to be sure, but no facilities 
have been provided to enable the foreign-born to meet these 
requirements. We have required the ability to “understand 
English,” and that the applicant be “attached to the prin- 
ciples of the Constitution,” but we have provided no pre-

  428 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
citizenship education, and the naturalization proceedings 
before judges, especially about election time, have too fre- 
quently been mere farces. : 
We see now that our schools must at once take on another 
new function, that of providing special classes and night 
schools, on an adequate scale, that will induct the foreign- 
born into the use of English as his common speech, and pre- 
pare him for naturalization by training him in the history 
and principles of our government, thus fitting him for proper 
membership in our national life by educating him along 
political, social, industrial, and sanitary lines. He, and she, 
must be educated for good citizenship if they are to remain 
among us. 
The school as a community center. One important recent 
effort looking in this direction is the one to transform the 
public school house from a mere day school for children into 
a usable center for the entire community life. In the 
eighties the schoolhouses of our cities were used only be- 
tween nine in the morning and three or four in the afternoon, 
and for from 150 to 180 days in the year. . The remainder 
of the time the school plant stood idle, and boys and girls 
were not allowed even about the grounds. The buildings 
usually contained only classrooms and an office, and were 
not adapted to other than day-school uses. To-day, every- 
where, the tendency is to change these earlier conditions, 
and to put the school plant to the largest possible commu- 
nity use. Through playgrounds, school gardens, vacation 
schools, and evening schools, our school grounds and school 
buildings in the cities and towns give much more service 
than formerly. As new school buildings have been erected 
and old ones rebuilt, they have been better fitted for use 
by the addition of an assembly hall, play rooms, a science 
room, a library room, and rooms for manual-training and 
household arts. Some also have workshops, baths, swim- 
ming-pools, and a gymnasium. 
As this more extensive and more expensive equipment 
has been added to the schools; as the need for new efforts to
-P-A-G-E-469
NEW DIRECTIONS OF EFFORT 429 
assimilate the new classes in society has become evident; and 
as an increased participation in the functions of government 
through the initiative, referendum, recall, primary, and 
women’s suffrage has come about, along with an increasing 
cosmopolitanism in our people; the demand has come that 
the public school, as the one great, active, unifying, non- 
racial, non-political, non-sectarian force in our national life, 
should take upon itself a new service and make of itself a 
center for the formation and education of community senti- 
ment. As the school plant already belongs to the people, it 
has also been demanded that it be put to a more constant 
after-school use for the benefit of the community about it. 
This has been done in many cities, and in a fewrural com- 
munities as well. Starting almost entirely since 1900, sta- 
tistics collected by the United States Bureau of Education 
show that 518 cities carried on community-center activities 
in their school buildings in 1915-16. These activities in- 
cluded lectures, on all kinds of human welfare topics, enter- 
tainments, adult society meetings, clubs for civic discussion, 
public meetings, dramatics, parties, social dancing, ban- 
quets, quiet reading and study, and the like. In 468 cities, 
for which the figures are complete, the school buildings were 
open on approximately 60,000 evenings, and the attendance 
was approximately 4,400,000 persons. 
The aim has been to make the public school building a 
center for the life of the community; to extend the work of 
the school into the homes, and thus influence the civic and 
social welfare of the people; and to broaden the popular 
conception of education by making it a life-long process. 
A recent writer puts the matter well when he says: 
When it is remembered that only ten per cent of the adult citi- 
zens have had a high school education, and only fifty per cent have 
ever completed the grammar grades, it becomes apparent that one 
of our great national needs is a popular university for the education 
of grown men and women. The public school as a community 
center is the answer to this national need. The community-center 
movement recognizes the fact that the mind matures more slowly
-P-A-G-E-470
480 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
than the body, and that education is a life-long process. While 
the public school is dedicated primarily to the welfare of the child, 
it is becoming daily more evident that the Nation’s welfare requires 
it to be used for adults and youths as well. Notwithstanding the 
fact that it is our finest American invention and the most successful 
social enterprise undertaken, its golden age lies before it. It is 
now being discovered anew in its possibilities for larger service. 
The fact that all men desire knowledge is the fact which has justi- 
fied the investment of $1,347,000,000 in the public school equip- 
ment; it is the fact which now justifies the use of this equipment 
for adults. In every part of the country there is a manifest tend- 
ency for the public school to develop into a house of the people 
to be used by them “for mutual aid in self-development.” This is 
the significant fact at the heart of the community-center move- 
ment, and the touchstone of its value to the national welfare. 
Agricultural extension. By an Act of Congress, approved 
May 8, 1914, and commonly known as the Smith-Lever 
Coéperative Agricultural Extension Act, Congress made the 
beginnings of what must ultimately prove to be a very im- 
portant national movement for adult education along the 
lines of the improvement of agriculture and rural home-life. 
It provides for national aid to the States for “the diffusion 
among the people of useful and practical information on 
subjects relating to agriculture and home economics, and to 
encourage the application of the same,” the work to be 
under the direction of the United States Department of 
Agriculture and to be done by the Agricultural Colleges in 
each State. The work must “consist of the giving of in- 
struction and practical demonstrations in agriculture and 
home economics” to persons not attending the colleges. An 
important part of the educational work is to be through pub- 
lications. For aiding the work the accompanying schedule 
of national aid to the States is provided. 
The amount for printing and disseminating information 
is to be distributed evenly among the States, but the amount 
for extension work is to be distributed to the States in the 
proportion that the rural population in each State bears to 
the total rural population of the United States. Each

State must double, from state sources, all national aid re- 
ceived. The far-reaching future importance of this new 
educational effort toward improving crops, stocks, and rural 
home-life among our people can hardly be overestimated. 
The rural teacher should know and keep in touch with this 
new work. 
IV. University Expansion AND ExTENSION 
Expansion of the original college. In Chapter VII we 
traced briefly the rise of the state university as the crown of 
the school system of the State, and the endowment by Con- 
gress, in 1862, of an entirely new type of higher instruction 
in the colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts. One of the 
earliest of these new institutions to become established, as 
well as one of the most heavily endowed, was Cornell Uni- 
versity, in New York, opened in 1868. This institution, 
and the State University of Michigan, together rendered a 
very valuable pioneer service, during the quarter-century 
following the opening of Cornell, in marking out new lines 
of collegiate activity and new relationships between the col- 
leges and the high schools beneath. At Cornell University 
instruction in science, agriculture, and engineering was 
placed on an entirely new footing, and the instruction in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-472
432 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
older subjects of the college curriculum was both broadened 
and deepened. Michigan was one of the first state universi- 
ties to free itself from the hampering influences of state poli- 
tics on the one hand and sectarian influences on the other; 
to open its doors to women on the same terms as men (1870); 
to begin the development of instruction in history (1857), 
. education (1879), and government (1881), with a view to 
serving the State; and to examine and accredit the high 
schools (1871) and receive pupils from accredited schools 
into its freshman class without examination. 
Before 1850 the colleges usually offered but one course, 
based on Greek, Latin, and Mathematics, known as the 
classical course, and leading to the A.B. degree. Brown 
offered a parallel course, without Greek and emphasizing 
more modern studies, in 1851, leading to the Ph.B. degree. 
Harvard organized the Lawrence Scientific School, in 1851, 
with instruction in science, and leading to the B.S. degree, 
and Yale made a similar organization in the Sheffield Scien- 
tific School, in 1852. Dartmouth and Rochester also estab- 
lished courses for the B.S. degree in 1852, Michigan in 1853, 
and Columbia a course for the Ph.B. degree in 1864. By 
1880 our colleges were offering three or four parallel courses, 
much as the high schools did twenty years later. These led 
to different degrees — B.A., B.L., B.S., and Ph.B. Gradu- 
ate instruction was also organized, and courses leading te 
the A.M., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees was in time provided. 
The first Ph.D. degree granted in the United States was by 
Yale, in 1851. Few others were granted by our universities 
before the opening of the first distinctively graduate uni- 
versity — Johns Hopkins, at Baltimore, in.1876. 
Creation of new chairs and schools. With the creation of 
new chairs to represent new subjects of study, or subdivi- 
sions of old subjects, which became common after about 
1875, the next tendency was to reorganize the colleges by 
departments, such as Greek, Latin, English, history, mathe- 
matics, physics, biology, etc. This became the common 
form of organization for the larger universities after about
-P-A-G-E-473
  NEW DIRECTIONS OF EFFORT 433 
1890, and still continues. With the very rapid increase in 
the quantity of knowledge, and the subdivision of old sub- 
jects into many new chairs, the more recent tendency has 
been to re-group the university into a series of colleges and 
schools. To-day a large state university would include 
most or all of the following colleges, schools, or divisions, 
each subdivided into a number of departments or branches 
of knowledge, and often leading to separate degrees. 
1. The college of liberal arts. 11. The school of law. 
2. The college of engineering. 12. The school of medicine. 
8. The college of agriculture. 13. The school of veterinary medi-

nomics. 14. The school of pharmacy. 
5. The school of pure science. 15. The school of dentistry. 
6. The school of education. 16. The school of forestry. 
7. The school of household arts. 17. The school of mining. 
8. The school of fine arts. 18. The school of architecture. 
9. The school of business adminis- 19. The university-extension divi- 
tration. sion. 
10. The school of journalism. 20. The summer-session division. 
Social significance of this great expansion. All this rapid 
development and subdivision of the university into schools 
and colleges indicates the assumption of new service for the 
welfare of the State. That the State has appreciated the 
service has been shown by a university development previ- 
ously unknown. Since about 1885, when the state univer- 
sities began to turn their attention to serving and advancing 
the welfare of the State, university attendance and revenues 
have advanced by leaps and bounds. During the same 
period the stimulating competition of such privately-en- 
dowed universities as Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Johns Hop- 
kins, Tulane, Chicago, and Stanford has also made itself 
felt. The growth in student enrollment may be seen from 
the figures, at different dates, for a dozen of our larger state 
universities, as given on the following page. 
Coincident with this rapid increase in students, faculty- 
schools, and courses has been the greatest number and 
amount of gifts of money to our universities ever given to

aid higher education in any land. Such gifts are evidence 
of the public appreciation of the valuable services to the 
State and Nation rendered by our colleges and universities, 
both publicly and privately endowed. The States, too, 
have put millions into the equipment and maintenance of 
these higher institutions, believing in them as creators of 
advanced public opinion and as training schools for the 
future leaders of the State. In a recent article in the Atlan- 
tic Monthly, President Pritchett wrote: 
The rise of these great universities is the most epoch-making 
feature of our American civilization, and they are to become more 
and more the leaders, and the makers of our civilization. They 
are of the people. When a state university has gained solid ground, 
it means that the people of a whole state have turned their faces 
toward the light; it means that the whole system of state schools 
has been welded into an effective agent for civilization. Those 
who direct the purposes of these great enterprises of democracy 
cannot be too often reminded that the highest function of a univer- 
sity is to furnish standards for a democracy. 
University extension. By way of rendering a still greater 
service to the people of the State, our state universities and 
agricultural colleges have recently made the beginnings of 
what seems destined to become a very important new fea-
-P-A-G-E-475

ture of their state service. By the development of study 
centers, lecture courses, and scientific and technical instruc- 
tion at many points within the State, by traveling exhibits, 
traveling libraries, correspondence study, and by short

urses provided at public-school centers, our universities

ages of higher education to the people of the State who have

we now have the agricultural extension work provided

for by the national government, through the Smith-Lever 
Bill (p. 480). | 
The University of Wisconsin has rendered notable service 
in this work, and may be considered as a type of the best 
and an example for development elsewhere. How it has 
extended its service to cover the whole State is shown on the 
above map. At the time this map was prepared, January, 
1915, the University had an active extension enrollment of 
7113 students, and during the preceding two years 1251 lec- 
tures had been given, in 525 communities, to estimated 
audiences totaling 370,750 people. In addition, 10,945 
“package libraries” had been loaned to different communi- 
ties in the State during the preceding four years, and the 
university service had also included state and municipal 
advising and health instruction. 
Such service can be made of the greatest value to the 
people of a State in elevating standards, developing public 
opinion, diffusing general and special knowledge, and build- 
ing up a more intelligent democratic life. With democracies 
so dependent on learning and leadership as we now see them 
to be, and with the many intricate problems ahead of us in 
the new world civilization which will follow the conclusion 
of the World War, it is almost certain that our universities 
will be called upon to play a much more important part in 
the education of democracy in the future than they have in 
the past. The university-extension movement, as well as 
all the other educational expansions and extensions traced 
in this chapter, are significant of new social and industrial 
conditions and new national needs. As our social and politi- 
cal life becomes more intricate and more complex, and our 
world connections more extensive, education must broaden 
its work and enlarge its functions to prepare our people for 
the demands which lie ahead.

DESIRABLE EDUCATIONAL REORGANIZATIONS    
    
                                                    Our progress toward scientific organization. Up to the 
days of Carter and Mann and Pierce in Massachusetts, and 
Barnard in Connecticut and Rhode Island, our school devel- 
opment had been almost entirely along the lines of securing 
legislation, first to permit, and later to require, the estab- 
lishment of schools; of organizing an administrative machin- 
ery to look after the schools thus established; and of creating 
a public belief in education for democratic ends and a senti- 
ment that would support further progress. The develop- 
ment was highly empirical, each community and State fol- 
lowing the lines of least resistance, without much regard to 
underlying principles of action. Carter and Mann tried to 
give a better organization to the schools of Massachusetts, 
as did Barnard in the two States to the south, while Mann 
tried by his Reports and addresses, and Barnard by his 
Journals to introduce the better teaching methods which 
American travelers abroad had described, and which both 
had seen in European schools. The schoolmasters of the 
time largely resented change, however, and few who taught 
felt the need for any training, so it was not until the move- 
ment looking toward a more scientific basis for our school 
practice had had infused into it the psychology of Pestalozzi, 
the new ideas of Guyot and Kriisi, and particularly the en- 
thusiasm of Sheldon, at Oswego, that we really set to work 
in earnest to psychologize instruction, train would-be teach- 
ers for teaching, and put schoolroom practice on something 
approaching a scientific basis. The period from 1860 to 
about 1885 to 1890 was with us the great period of “fac- 
ulty”’-psychology and subject methodology. This period 
was also marked by the firm establishment of the public
-P-A-G-E-482
  442 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
normal school, and the beginnings of the professional study 
of education in our universities. 
New directions during the past two decades. Since then 
we have obtained some new ideas from abroad and have 
worked out many new conceptions of the educational pro- 
cess at home, and as a result we to-day possess a truer psy- 
chology than Sheldon and his followers knew, while the 
child-study movement has opened up entirely new concep- 
tions as to the nature of child development. A new profes- 
sion of teaching has been created, and the administration of 
public education has been organized into a new professional 
subject by our colleges and universities. Above all, our edu- 
cational thinking has been colored through and through by 
the new social and industrial forces which have become so 
prominent during the past quarter-century, and as a result 
we to-day think in terms of a new educational philosophy, 
and direct the work of our schools along new lines and 
toward new ends. 
Within the past quarter of a century a number of new 
educational conceptions have come to the front which have 
already deeply modified our educational thinking and prac- 
tices, and which promise to do more than any previous im- 
pulses to reorganize our educational work after a rational 
plan, and to give scientific direction to our educational 
procedure. These may be classified under the following 
larger headings: 
1. The scientific study of education. 
2. The reorganization of school work. 
8. The reorganization and redirection of rural and village edu- 
cation. 
4. State educational reorganization. ' 
We will consider each of these, briefly, in the above order. 
I. Tue Screntiric Stupy or Epucation 
The overcrowded curriculum. From the diagram on 
page 327, showing the evolution of our elementary-school 
curriculum, it must be evident that, if the school subjects of
-P-A-G-E-483
DESIRABLE EDUCATIONAL REORGANIZATIONS 443 
1825 or 1850 occupied all the time of the school, the many 
new subjects added since must seriously overburden the 
course of study, even after making all due allowance for 
better trained teachers, longer school terms, and better text- 
books and teaching appliances. The newer expression sub- 
jects (p. 370) also require better teaching preparation and 
more careful supervision than did the old book subjects. 
To the 1900 list should now be added school gardening, 
agriculture, play as a regular school subject, and a much 
greater emphasis on the social and industrial aspects of all 
our school work. 
The result has been that our elementary school courses of 
study have become badly crowded and that teachers, es- 
pecially in the upper grades, can no longer be expected to be 
qualified to teach satisfactorily all the subjects of the ele- 
mentary school course. Nor would there be time in which 
to teach all the subjects in the old way, even admitting that 
the teacher was properly prepared to do so. 
Early attempts at solving the problem. With the increase 
of new studies, the “‘over-burdening of the curriculum” had 
become a real live issue by 1890, and various attempts have 
since been made to solve the problem. In many places the 
introduction of the expression subjects was fought by calling 
them “fads and frills,” and for a time they were kept out. 
This line of attack has now been given up except by a few 
of the older generation. It has been seen that abuse and 
ridicule are not arguments, while it has become increasingly 
evident that these same expression studies are not only val- 
uable educational instruments in themselves, but also supply 
a real need under our changed conditions of living. 
One of the earliest proposals for solving the over-bur- 
dened-curriculum difficulty was that we concentrate instruc- 
tion about a few main subjects, and then correlate the other 
school work about these central subjects. Colonel Francis 
W. Parker (p. 328) was the leading advocate of this idea, 
and his book on the teaching of geography was to show how 
this could be done about geography as the central core. 
   
-P-A-G-E-484
444 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
The National Education Association’s Committee of Fifteen, 
in its Report in 1895, devoted half the space to the correlation 
of elementary school subjects. During the nineties the terms 
concentration and correlation were terms to conjure with. 
Eliminating useless subject-matter. Another plan pro- 
posed, and one that has proved very useful, has been to cut 
out parts of many of the subjects taught and to confine in- 
struction to what is left. This has been done extensively. 
For example, we do not now teach a third as much arithmetic 
or grammar as we used to do; the facts in geography and the 
dates and battles of history are made much less prominent 
than they used to be; and bone and muscle and nerve physi- 
ology and the memorization of the Constitution have been 
displaced by hygiene and community civics. The tendency

has been to eliminate the puzzles and little-used informa- 
tion, and to cut out all that is not useful for modern life 
needs. We thus not only simplify the teaching of the sub- 
ject but make room for other subjects as well. 
The Herbartians (p. 317) have been of much help here, as 
they have urged the teaching of “type studies,” instead of 
hundreds of isolated facts. For example, in geography, a 
study of such types as coal-mining, a seaport, a railroad- 
center, the cotton industry, sheep and wool, shipping, trans- 
portation, and the interdependence of people, should take 
the place of learning great numbers of isolated facts. In 
history, instruction in such type studies as the internal 
development of our Nation, the development of the West, 
the growth of political parties, the rise of slavery, the evolu- 
tion of transportation, the Monroe Doctrine, and the domi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-485
    DESIRABLE EDUCATIONAL REORGANIZATIONS 445 
nance of cotton in our early history and the effect of the 
invention of the cotton gin, should replace the chronological 
study of American annals. The same idea has been applied 
to science instruction, literature, civics, hygiene, and other 
studies. The work of Charles, Frank, and Lida McMurry 
has been very helpful along these lines. 
Still more recently a committee of the National Education 
Association on “Economy of Time in Education” has made 
careful studies of possible eliminations, and the National 
Society for the Study of Education has made also valu- 
able reports on “Minimum Essentials in Elementary School 
Subjects.” All of these have been along the line of eliminat- 
ing what is no longer important to teach, and should be 
studied by those interested in the problem. 
The ‘project’ idea. Another very important attempt 
at the solution of the problem has been along the line of 
abandoning largely the old subject-classification, and teach- 
ing “projects” instead. The work of John Dewey, in the- 
experimental elementary school he conducted for some years 
(1896-1900) at Chicago, was pioneer work along this line. 
Making motor expression, social participation, and the in- 
dustries of life the ideas around which instruction centered, 
and making the school reproduce the typical conditions of 
social life, he constructed a course of study based largely on 
occupations, projects, and social demands, and continually 
calling for expression rather than receptivity. In his school 
the work of the teacher was largely that of planning, guiding, 
and interposing “pedagogical interference” to direct the 
activities of the children along lines that would be helpful 
and educationally profitable. The old formal school sub- 
jects, with set times for classes, were replaced by studies, 
projects, and activities, into which were introduced number, 
speech, reading, writing, drawing, manual work, history, 
and geography, as needed to understand or work out the 
project of the day or week. The school resembled a com- 
bination of a kindergarten and a series of workshops more 
than an ordinary school.
-P-A-G-E-486
446 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Recently a number of attempts at reorganizing instruction 
on some form of the project, or pupil-activity basis, have 
been tried. The school of Mrs. Johnson, at Fairhope, Ala- 
bama, described by Dewey (see bibliography) forms a good 
modern example. There the elementary school course of 
study, instead of being made up of arithmetic, language, 
geography, history, etc., is organized under the headings of 
physical exercise, nature study, music, hand work, field 
geography, descriptive geography, reading, story-telling, 
sense culture, number, dramatization, and games. The 
experimental elementary school at the University of Mis- 
souri, also described by Dewey, divided the day’s work 
equally among four activities — play, stories, observation, 
and hand work — and built its instruction around these 
four. 
The new scientific study of the problem. Within the past 
decade an entirely new means of attacking the problem has 
been developed through what are known as scientific tests. 
The movement is as yet only in its infancy, but so important 
is it in terms of the future that it bids fair to change the 
whole character of the supervision of the instruction in our 
schools. The scientific purpose of the new movement has 
been to try to evolve, by the careful measurement of schools 
and children, a series of standards of measurement (measur- 
ing sticks for school work) and units of accomplishment 
(time and effort evaluations of instruction) which can be 
applied to schools anywhere to determine, scientifically, 
the economy or wastefulness and the efficiency or inefficiency 
of the work being done. On the basis of such information 
the effectiveness of all kinds of instruction can be measured, 
and schools in different places can be accurately compared. 
The leader in this movement has been Professor Edward L. 
Thorndike, of Teachers College, Columbia University. 
These tests and measures we now know as Standard 
Scales. So forcibly has this new idea of measurement ap- 
pealed to the younger school men that to-day probably hun- 
dreds of men and women are busy testing and perfecting
-P-A-G-E-487
  DESIRABLE EDUCATIONAL REORGANIZATIONS 447 
scales for all kinds of measurements, new or improved scales 
are being proposed continually in the educational magazines, 
and a few very helpful books for the use of teachers have 
already been written on the subject. So far we have 
evolved fairly satisfactory scales for the measurement of: 
Arithmetical ability. English composition. 
Reasoning skill. Use of English. 
Handwriting. Silent reading. 
Spelling. Oral reading. 
Drawing. Geography. 
For each of these subjects certain “‘standard scores,” that is 
the amount of work with the tests which should be done by 
average pupils, of any age or grade, have been worked out. 
A new ability to diagnose. With these standard tests and 
scores we can now measure an unknown class and say, rather 
definitely, that, for example, the class not only spells poorly 
but is 12 per cent below standard; that the class is 8 per cent 
ahead of its place in speed of writing, but 15 per cent below 
on quality; that the children are from 6 to 16 per cent above 
grade in the four simple arithmetical processes, but 21 per 
cent below in ability to reason on simple arithmetical prob- 
lems; that they can read orally 16 per cent better than the 
average class, but are sadly deficient in thought-getting 
ability from silent reading; and that, in composition, they 
are 10 per cent below standard and can write much better 
than they can think. Still more, we can determine just 
where the difficulty lies, not only with schools or classes, but 
for individual pupils in classes as well, as may be seen from 
the pupil score card in Arithmetic, given on page 448. 
Within the past five years these tests have been used in 
School Surveys in a number of American cities, and those 
responsible for the conduct of the schools were told, as a 
result of the tests, where their schools stood in the matter of 
instruction. Butte (1914), Salt Lake City (1915), Cleve- 
land (1916), and Grand Rapids (1917) form good examples 
of the use of these tests to diagnose conditions. In Butte, 
for example, the schools were found ahead of where they
-P-A-G-E-488
       
   
        448 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
should have been in all formal drill subjects, and below 
where they should have been in all subjects involving reason- 
ing or expression. In Salt Lake City, the schools were found 
to rank high and above standard in all subjects in which

tests were given — spelling, composition, writing, reading, 
and arithmetic — but that the range of pupil abilities in 
classes and schools was too large, and that too much time 
was being given to these subjects at the expense of other 
studies. The Cleveland measurements showed much wrong 
emphasis in instruction, far too wide variations between 
schools and classes, and need of an entirely new type of 
school supervision to secure better results for the money 
expended, The schools of Grand Rapids, as a whole, were

found near to where they should be, the attention needed 
being to individual schools, rather than to the school system 
as a whole. 
Standard tests as a basis for course of study eliminations. 
The studies made with the use of the tests, too, have shown 
that in some school subjects we have been teaching far too 
much in quantity, giving too much school time to instruc- 
tion in them, or over-emphasizing certain phases of the 
teaching of a subject to the neglect of other important 
phases. The children of Butte, for example, were learning 
to spell over 10,000 words, while all careful studies made of 
vocabularies show that 1000 words will cover the most 
commonly used and most commonly misspelled words, and 
that about 3500 words are all that need be taught. In Salt 
Lake City children were being given 25 per cent more school 
time for writing than was necessary, and were being drilled 
to a degree of perfection in penmanship which was wasteful 
of time and energy. In Cleveland too much time was being 
given to oral reading, without results to warrant the expen- 
diture. In Grand Rapids the composition tests showed the 
pupils to be over-drilled in the mechanics of composition, 
but poor in ability to think. On the basis of such studies, 
combined with studies as to the social usefulness of the 
various parts of the different school subjects, and studies as 
to the pedagogy of instruction, we have already been able 
to do something in the revision of our elementary school 
curriculum that has lightened the load and materially im- 
proved the instruction of what remains. 
By creating such measuring sticks for school work, both 
supervisors and teachers are given a far more definite aim 
than ever before for the work they are to do. Waste of 
energy through over- or under-emphasis of certain phases of 
the teaching process may be prevented. Principals and 
teachers can tell, from a glance at the results of standard 
tests, charted on a standard score card, whether or not any 
room or group of pupils is up to standard; what are the 
weak points; whether a room or a school is making progress;
-P-A-G-E-490
450 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
    
      
   
                                    
   
             and in what rooms the load and the teacher are not properly 
adjusted. Teachers, in particular, can know definitely what 
results are expected of them, and at all times whether or not 
they are accomplishing them. Even pupils can, in some 
subjects, score their own records on standard score cards, 
calculate their growth in accuracy and speed, and compare 
their writing with the standardized writing of a writing 
scale hung in the room. 
The important underlying purpose in the creation of all 
such standards for measuring school work and for comparing 
the accomplishments of pupils, classes, schools, or school 
systems, is to give to supervisors’ and teachers means by 
which they may, quite definitely, measure the effectiveness 
of the work they do, and learn from the charted results 
where to shift the emphasis and how to improve the manu- 
facturing process. Teaching without a measuring stick of 
standardized length, and without definite standards (stand- 
ard scores, or norms) for the work of the different grades, is 
much like the old time luck-and-chance farming, and there 
is no reason to think that the introduction of well-tested 
standards for accomplishment in school work will not do for 
education what has been done for agriculture as a result of 
the application of scientific knowledge and methods. This 
recent development of tests and measures for instruction is 
a movement looking toward scientific accuracy in teaching, 
and is comparable in importance to the introduction of the 
idea, in the sixties, of an orderly psychological development 
in children, to which a methodology of instruction should be 
applied. 
The measurement of intelligence. Within the past ten 
years we have also worked out and perfected another new 
and very important means whereby it is now possible to 
measure and classify children on the basis of their intel- 
lectual capacities. From the use so far made of this new 
measuring stick in retesting children once measured, at a 
later age, it is now confidently asserted that the degree of 
intelligence which a child has at six or eight or ten years of
-P-A-G-E-491
  
DESIRABLE EDUCATIONAL REORGANIZATIONS 451 
age is the degree of intelligence he will retain through life, 
That is, a child of 80 per cent of average intelligence at six 
years of age will remain close to 80 per cent the remainder of 
his life, and a child of 120 per cent will remain close to 120 
per cent. Instead of being born free and equal, we are born 
free and unequal, and unequal we shall ever remain. The 
school, we now see, cannot make intelligence; it can only 
train and develop and make useful the intelligence which the 
child brings with him to school. This is a matter of his 
racial and family inheritance, and nothing within the gift of 
the schools or our democratic form of government. From 
the use of this new measuring stick, too, we have found that 
there can be no arbitrary classification of children into such 
groups as dull, average, and bright. Instead, children 
shade off from one classification into another, all the way 
from idiocy at one end of the scale to superior genius at the 
other. As might be expected, most children fall into the 
relatively normal class, the curve shading off somewhat 
evenly in either direction. 
By means of a series of carefully selected and standardized 
mental tests, first worked out by Binet and Simon in France 
(1911), and revised and extended and adapted to use with 
American children by Terman (1916), we are now able to 
measure and give each child an intelligence rating (intelli-

-P-A-G-E-492
452 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
gence quotient; I. Q.). From this rating (I. Q.) we know 
somewhat accurately the possibilities of the child in school 
work. Terman’s studies showed that the distribution of 
the intelligence of children, between 5 and 14 years of age, is 
approximately as shown in the last diagram, the extremes 
in intelligence in the children he measured ranging from 56 
to 145. On the basis of his work he suggested the following 
classification of children as to I. Q. and mental capacity. 
  r.Q. Classification 
Above 140............ Near genius or genius. 
120-140... ... Very superior intelligence. 
110-120.............. Superior intelligence. 
90-110 Normal, or average intelligence. 
80-90................ Dullness. 
70-80................ Border-line deficiency, sometimes classifiable as 
dullness, often as feeble-mindedness. 
Below 70............. Definite feeble-mindedness. 
Educational significance of intelligence measurements. 
The educational significance of this new means of measuring 
intelligence is very large. Questions relating to proper 
classification in school, grading, promotion, choice of studies, 
schoolroom procedure, vocational guidance, and the proper 
handling of subnormal children on the one hand and gifted 
children on the other, all acquire new meaning when 
viewed in the light of intelligence measurement. To quote 
Terman: 
Wherever intelligence tests have been made in any considerable 
number in the schools it has been shown that not far from 2 per 
cent of the children enrolled have a grade of intelligence which, 
however long they live, will never develop beyond the level which 
is normal to the average child of 11 or 12 years. They may be 
able to drag along to the 4th, 5th, or 6th grades, but even by the 
age of 16 or 18 years they are never able to cope successfully with 
the more abstract and difficult parts of the common-school course 
of study. They may master a certain amount of rote learning, 
such as that involved in reading and in the manipulation of num- 
ber combinations, but they cannot be taught to meet new condi-
-P-A-G-E-493
DESIRABLE EDUCATIONAL REORGANIZATIONS 453 
    
                                                  
   
       tions effectively, or to think, reason, and judge as normal persons 
do. : 
On the other hand, the number of children with very superior 
ability is approximately as great as the number of feeble-minded. 
The future well-being of this country hinges, in no small degree, 
upon the right education of these superior children. Psychological 
tests show that children of superior ability usually fail to reap any 
advantage whatever, in terms of promotion, from their superior 
intelligence. The large majority of superior children tested are 
found located below the school grade warranted by their intelli- 
gence level. 
When these new tests of intelligence have been applied to 
the children who experience difficulty in getting along in the 
regular school a flood of light has been thrown on the prob- 
lem. Low mentality, retardation in school, truancy, im- 
morality, and criminal tendencies are all tied up closely 
together. It may now be confidently asserted, on the basis 
of tests so far made, that approximately 2 per cent of the 
children in our schools are of such low mentality that they 
probably never will attain to a grade of intelligence above 
that normal for a twelve-year-old child; that among the 
children in our reform (industrial) schools 20 to 30 per cent 
are feeble-minded, and another 20 to 25 per cent of low- 
grade mentality; that approximately 25 to 30 per cent of our 
criminals and 30 to 40 per cent of our prostitutes are feeble- 
minded. Of the low-grade-in-intelligence members of these 
classes, very few have ever progressed beyond the fifth 
grade in school. Lacking in the ability to foresee and weigh 
consequences, and unable to exercise self-restraint, every 
low-grade or feeble-minded girl is a potential prostitute, and 
every boy of the type a potential criminal. 
Viewed in the light of this new knowledge, the importance 
of mental measurements to grade and classify intelligence, 
of the standard tests to determine lines of progress, and of 
all the special types of schools for delinquents and defectives 
mentioned in Chapter XII — differentiated course of study, 
over-age classes, non-English-speaking classes, supplemen- 
   
-P-A-G-E-494
ABA EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
tal coaching classes, industrial classes, home schools, disci- 
plinary classes, parental schools, state industrial schools — 
acquire a new educational significance in the light of our 
recent discoveries as to the measurement and grading of 
intelligence. The recent development of standard scales 
and a scale for the grading of intelligence mark distinct for- 
ward steps in the improvement of our educational proce- 
dure. Just now they are both new, but as they are learned 
by teachers and principals, and their use made common, 
schoolroom methods will become more intelligent, children 
will be classified and taught better, and the needs of the 
slow on the one hand and the gifted on the other will be 
better cared for by our schools. Both represent important 
new steps forward in the process of making education a more 
scientific procedure. k | 
II. Taz Reorcanization or Scooon Work 
The 8-4 school as evolved by 1890. Our common-school 
system was an outgrowth of a great democratic movement, 
beginning in the early part of the nineteenth century, which 
created common tax-supported schools for democracy’s 
ends. The college, on the other hand, has its roots back in 
the Middle Ages, and originally was founded to pass on to a 
small privileged class the inherited learning of the ages. In 
between the two there arose with us the academy, and this 
later was superseded by the public tax-supported high 
school. This, when created, unlike the common practice 
with higher schools in Europe (see Fig. 51, p. 268) was 
superimposed by democracy on the common school which 
had previously grown up. As was shown in the tabulation 
for twenty-five cities given on page 228, the parts of our 
school system at first possessed no fixed limits or length of 
course. Sometimes we found a three-year high school super- 
imposed on anywhere from a six- to a nine-year elementary- 
school course of study, and sometimes a four-year school 
superimposed on schools of varying length below. In time 
the nine-year elementary school became common in the New

England States, the seven-year elementary school in the 
Southern States, and the eight-year elementary schools 
elsewhere, with a three-year and later a’ four-year high- 
school course superimposed on top of each. 
By 1890 the 8-4 plan of organization, shown in the chart 
on page 99, had become common everywhere, except in 
the South, the nine-year elementary school in New England 
being due to the admission of children to the lowest grade at _ 
five, instead of six. The high school was thus dovetailed 
in between the common school on the one side and the col- 
lege on the other, as is shown in the left-hand plan given in 
Figure 82, page 460. A perfect educational ladder was 
thus provided by democracy, leading from the kindergarten 
at the bottom to the graduate or professional schools at the 
top. This all came about so naturally as the result of a slow 
native evolution, and seemed to fit so well the educational 
needs of the time, that no one for a time questioned the 
arrangement. 
First questioning of the arrangement. In 1888 President 
Charles W. Eliot, of Harvard University, read a paper before 
the Department of Superintendence of the National Educa- 
tion Association on “Can School Programs be Shortened 
and Enriched?” and in 1892 followed this by another before 
the National Education Association on “Shortening and 
Enriching the Grammar School Course.”” These two papers 
started a discussion of a new educational problem, — that of 
the respective purposes and places in our educational sys- 
tem of the common elementary school, the high school, and 
the college. The discussion centered about the questions 
of shortening the instruction in the old drill subjects, the 
addition of new and more advanced studies in the upper 
grades of the elementary school, the specialization of the 
work of teachers there by the introduction of a departmental 
type of teaching for the sixth, seventh, and eighth school 
grades, and the shortening of the whole course of instruction 
so that boys might begin their professional study and life- 
work at an earlier age. These topics were much discussed 
 
-P-A-G-E-498
    456 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
for a decade and a half, and much careful thinking was given 
to them. | 
As a result, many schools, between about 1890 and 1905, 
reorganized the instruction in the upper grades by changing 
from the grade-teacher plan to a departmental type of in- 
struction. A few new subjects, such as elementary algebra 
and geometry, elementary science, and Latin or a modern 
language were introduced, here and there, as new studies for 
selected classes in the upper grades, but usually there was 
no differentiation in courses, and no changes in the relation 
of the elementary school to the high school. The public 
school system still remained an 8-4 school system, with at 
best the five lower grades taught by the grade plan and the 
three upper by the departmental plan. The chief result of 
the discussion, though by no means a small one in itself, was 
to specialize more the work of the teachers in the upper ele- 
mentary school grades, with a resulting improvement in the 
quality of the instruction. 
One other result of importance was that the discussion 
aroused led to the appointment of three committees by 
the National Education Association, the reports of which 
were widely read and materially influenced subsequent 
thinking. These were: 
Appointed Committee Reported 
1891 Committee of Ten on Secondary School Studies 1893 
1893 Committee of Fifteen on Elementary Education 1895 
1895 Committee on College Entrance Requirements 1899 
A new direction given the discussion. In 1901 Professor 
John Dewey, and in 1902 President Harper, at the meetings 
of conferences of academies and high schools at the Univer- 
sity of Chicago, gave the discussion a new direction by 
questioning the organization of public education as then 
developed. President Harper proposed to condense and 
shorten the elementary school to six years, and then extend 
the high school to an equal length of time. For such a 
change he advanced many educational arguments. This 
proposal, too, brought forth much educational discussion.
-P-A-G-E-499
  DESIRABLE EDUCATIONAL REORGANIZATIONS 457 
A number of committees to consider it were appointed by 
different educational associations, a number of reports were 
prepared and printed, and many articles on the question 
appeared in the educational magazines. The fact that, in 
1900, two of the most progressive nations in the world, 
France and Japan, had revised their national systems of 
education and virtually limited elementary education to 
six years, was quoted; and the educational exhibits at the 
St. Louis Exposition, in 1904, made it conspicuously evident 
that the United States was almost the only important nation 
to prolong elementary education to eight or nine years. In 
the Philippines, too, we had just organized a school system 
built on a four-year elementary school. 
General result of the discussion. The result of a decade 
of discussion which followed this new proposal was a rather 
general acceptance, at least by those who had participated 
actively in it, of the idea of shortening the drill and funda- 
mental-knowledge instruction of the elementary school to 
six years, and the organization of all the instruction of 
the following eight years — the seventh and eighth grades, 
the four years of the high school period, and the first two 
years of the college course — into some organized form of 
secondary education, as is done in most European countries. 
It gradually came to be felt that such an arrangement would 
not’ only provide for better instruction, but that it would 
be based on better psychological grounds than the 8-4 plan. 
Under the plans proposed the first two years of the college 
course would become more closely connected with the sec- 
ondary school — perhaps an integral part of it — and the 
university of the future would in consequence become a group 
of professional schools, beginning at the present junior year. 
The general result would be the enrichment of instruction, 
the provision of larger educational opportunities at home 
for the more ambitious pupils, and the capable student 
would be able to finish college by the time he was twenty, 
get his professional preparation made by twenty-three or 
twenty-four, and thus enter upon his professional life at
-P-A-G-E-500
458 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
least two years earlier than was then the case. The follow- 
ing statement, made by Professor Alexis F. Lange, in 1909, 
is expressive of the general result arrived at as the outcome 
of the discussion carried on between 1902 and 1909. He 
said: 
The question is no longer, Shall the high school live unto itself; 
but, How shall it live with its neighbors on either side? . . . Edu- 
cation must become more continuous, not mechanically, but 
organically. The sixteen or more grades of our school system 
must come to stand approximately for as many adaptations to 
unbroken growth. The educational edifice erected by the nine- 
teenth century still resembles too closely an irregular pyramid of 
three boxes, the tops and bottoms of which are perforated in order 
that the more acrobatic pupils may vault from the known tothe 
unknown, and their teachers above and below may exchange male- 
dictions. The twentieth century cannot accept this arrangement 
as final. The structure, as seen from the outside, may well remain 
intact; but the provisional tops and bottoms inside must be refitted, 
if not removed. Now, one essential in preparing for this task is to 
realize that adolescence begins at least two years earlier and ends 
about two years later than the inherited accidental high-school 
period. Divested of artificial meanings, secondary education is 
seen to cover not less than eight grades, instead of four. 
Up to 1911 or 1912 the question of educational reorganiza- 
tion remained largely an academic question, though being 
increasingly subjected to critical analysis by practical school 
men to see if the reorganizations proposed could be carried 
out in practice. Along with this study of the problem of 
educational reorganization a number of other practical 
school problems, such as the acceleration of capable chil- 
dren, retardation and its causes, flexible grading, promo- 
tional schemes, courses of study eliminations, and parallel 
and differentiated courses of study to meet varying social 
and individual needs, now began ‘to receive a hitherto un- 
known attention. Within the past half-dozen years not 
only these problems, but the earlier question of educational 
reorganization as well, have been put in a new light through 
the use of the new standard tests and the new ability to
-P-A-G-E-501
TES ener ee LT oe TENE TS | Oe ee we me ee eer eee eae 
DESIRABLE EDUCATIONAL REORGANIZATIONS 459 
measure and grade intelligence. The desirability of some 
form of educational reorganization now stands forth clearer 
than ever before. 
The 6-3-3 and 6-3-5 plans evolved. The result of this 
twenty-five years of discussion, the careful thought given to 
the practical administrative problems just mentioned above, 
the new light on our educational work obtained through the 
use of new measuring tests, and a growing consciousness 
that the problem of educational reorganization was a real 
one, with educational, social, and psychological bearings of 
far-reaching importance, have all combined recently to 
change the problem from an academic into a very practical 
issue. From the educational point of view the problem has 
become — Can any reorganization better fit the school to 
attract and retain a larger percentage of the older boys and 
girls who now drop out, and can a more flexible organization 
be devised to meet the needs alike of the slow, the gifted, 
and the peculiar? From a social point of view the problem 
has become — Can the instruction, by any reorganization, 
be adapted better to the needs of the different social classes, 
and thus meet better the social and industrial demands of 
our modern world? From the psychological point of view 
the problem has become — Can we adjust our school work 
better to the natural growth and mental-development 
periods of child life? From the democratic point of view 
the problem remains almost as stated by President Eliot, — : 
Can we by any rearrangement meet better the needs of the 
gifted children, and thus permit them to progress more 
rapidly through school? 
After the problem of reorganization had shaped itself in 
these ways, as a result of the long discussion, a number of 
important experiments in educational reorganization began. 
While these have varied somewhat, in different parts of the 
United States, the most common plan so far worked out, 
and one which contains the essential features of practically 
all the variations, is what has become known as the 6-3-3 
plan, and is as shown by the right-hand diagram given in

Figure 82. The essential features of the plan are (1) the 
reorganization of the first six years into a school for liter- 
acy and citizenship, and for attaining the use of the funda- 
mental tools of learning; (2) the organization of the last two 
years of the elementary school and the first year of the high 
school into a new school, known as the intermediate school, 
or the junior high school, to be provided for in separate 
buildings, taught by a departmental plan of instruction, and 
to offer more advanced studies than the usual grade-school 
does, with some variations in courses to meet different pupil 
needs; (3) the formal high school to constitute the three 
upper years; and (4) the first two years of college work to be 
closely related, and in a sense complementary, to the work 
of the high school. Where possible the first two years of 
college work may be added to the high school, or closely 
connected with it by a separate organization known as a 
junior college. When so connected, as is done in a number 
of California cities, the plan becomes a 6-3-5 plan. The 
university then should consist of a large number of profes- 
sional schools, beginning with the junior year, or so-called 
senior college. This plan, as will be seen from the diagram, 
can be made to meet the needs of different social classes with 
different educational destinations, can so shorten college and 
professional preparation that our youth may complete their 
professional preparation some two years earlier than at 
present and begin their life-work at an earlier age, can be 
adapted easily to the needs of the new vocational education, 
and can be fitted to continuation schools which will carry 
the youth along to the age of eighteen in vocational lines. 
Advantages of such educational reorganization. The 
6-3-3 plan not only makes better provision for meeting 
varying educational and social needs, but can be defended 
as psychologically more sound than the 8-4 plan. The age 
of twelve, rather than the age of fourteen, is the dividing 
place between the pre-adolescent and the adolescent stages 
of development, and the place where methods and types of 
instruction should change. By a rearrangement by means
-P-A-G-E-504
  462 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
  of which each division of the school system is made to serve 
a distinct educational, social, and psychological purpose, and 
has a distinct outline of work shaped to meet such ends, the 
school is made into a much more useful social institution. 
Eight years, beginning at six, carries the child beyond the 
period necessary for acquiring the tools of knowledge, and 
beyond the natural division of his life which comes at the 
dawn of adolescence. 
Instead of being kept under grade teachers, grinding on 
the tools of knowledge long past the period of interest in 
such work, the child at twelve passes to a school organized 
by subjects, taught by teachers with better preparation in 
specialized lines, and better adapted to utilize that curiosity, 
eagerness, plasticity, impressionability, and ambition to- 
ward adult goals which characterize the years from twelve 
to fifteen or sixteen. In such a school general courses, offer- 
ing a survey of the fields of human knowledge, and some 
opportunity to determine individual aptitudes, should be 
the characteristics of the instruction. There should also be 
some options and differentiations in courses to meet the 
needs of different types of children. 
With such an introductory training pupils would be far 
better fitted to enter and carry the work of the regular high 
school which follows, or to turn to the trade and vocational 
courses and become intelligent workers in our modern in- 
dustrial society. With such an educational reorganization 
it should be the ambition of every community to see that 
every normal pupil, before the compulsory school-years 
have passed, shall have completed the six-year elementary 
course and some line of study in the three-year intermediate 
or junior high school. In cities willing to organize their 
schools on the 6-3-5 plan, as many California cities have 
done, the completion of the fourteenth grade, at twenty, 
should provide a good college education, well adapted either 
to professional study or to the duties of municipal or political 
life. 
The Flemer ‘‘ Modern School ” proposal. In 1916 Presi-
-P-A-G-E-505
DESIRABLE EDUCATIONAL REORGANIZATIONS 463 
dent Eliot published a paper on the “ Changes needed in 
American Secondary Education,” in which he urged that 
“the best part of all human knowledge has come by exact 
and studied observation made through the senses,” and that 
“the most important part of education has always been the 
training of the senses through which the best part of knowl- 
edge comes.” He accordingly urged that our high schools 
give much more time to scientific and technical instruction 
in place of their excessive devotion to book-subject studies. 
This was followed, in 1917, by a paper on “A Modern 
School,” by Abraham Flexner, of The General Education 
Board, which was in a way a constructive sequel to Presi- 
dent Eliot’s paper. In this he asserted that tradition largely 
determined what was taught in our high schools; showed 
that the great amount of time spent on Latin, literature, and 
mathematics did not produce results; and asserted that a 
modern school should make it much more important to 
young people to know, to care about, and to understand 
the physical and social world in which they live. To this 
end a modern secondary-school course of study should 
emphasize activities in four fields: 
1. Science — This to be the central feature of the school. 
2. Industry — The occupations and trades of the indus- 
trial world. 
8. Civics — History, civic institutions, and the organi- 
zation of society and government. 
4. Aisthetics — Literature, languages, music, and art. 
He also contended that the subjects of the high-school course 
were in need of revision to eliminate useless material and to 
add much-needed new material. Still further, he contended 
that all general education should be completed by the age 
of twenty, so that young people could enter on professional 
study or life-work by that age. 
The latter paper brought forth much discussion, and 
some bitter criticism from the partisans of the old classical 
training. Finally a school, to carry out the experiment and 
evolve the kind of modern instruction described, was en-

dowed by The General Education Board, in New York 
City, and placed under the direction of the Teachers College 
at Columbia University. The work to be done in this 
school will be well worth watching, as it is likely to work out 
important new lines in secondary-school instruction. 
The Gary idea. Another educational reorganization, or 
rather the construction of a school system from the founda- 
tions along new lines, is represented by the school system 
recently built up at Gary, Indiana. This represents one of 
the most original pieces of constructive work ever attempted 
in American education, and contains many ideas of impor- 
tance for our schools. Whether or not the Gary idea will, 
in time, become a common type of school one cannot now 
say, but it represents a type of social service of which few 
schools as at present organized are capable. In some form 
this idea has been adopted in a number of our cities. 
At Gary the schools run on a four-quarter plan, each 
quarter of twelve weeks’ duration; the school plant is a 
play-ground, garden, workshop, social center, library, and 
a traditional-type school all combined in one; the elemen- 
tary-school and the high-school work are both given under 
the same roof; some of the high-school subjects begin as early 
as the fifth grade; specialization in the instruction and, in 
consequence, departmental instruction run through the 
schools; classes in special out-door activities and shop work 
are carried on at the same time as indoor classes, thus dou- 
bling the capacity of the school plant; the school day is eight 
hours long, with the school plant open also all day Saturday; 
continuation schools and social and recreational centers are 
conducted in the same plant in the evenings; and play and 
vocational work are important features of the instruction in 
all schools. Each school is, in effect, a world in itself, busily 
engaged in the work and play and government of the world, 
and so well do such activities and a highly flexible curricu- 
lum meet the needs of all classes that the need for most of the 
promotional machinery and special-type classes and schools 
found elsewhere is here eliminated.

Significance of the reorganization movement. It has 
been the effort to readjust the work of our inherited educa- 
tional system to meet the changed conditions in our national 
life — social, industrial, political, religious, economic, scien- 
tific — brought about by the industrial revolution of the 
latter part of the nineteenth century, which has been behind 
all the discussion and the efforts at educational reorganiza- 
tion since President Eliot started the discussion thirty years 
ago. The question is as yet by no means settled, and fur- 
ther, the need for educational reorganizations is certain to 
be given new emphasis by the new position the United 
States will occupy in world affairs as a result of the World 
War. New committees will be appointed to consider the 
question, new experiments will be tried, new courses of 
study will be worked out, much old subject-matter will 
be eliminated, new textbooks will be written, and perhaps 
more than one new type of school will be perfected. The 
day of the simple uniform school system has gone forever, 
but underneath all the discussion and the present diversity 
in practice lies a serious attempt to create, by evolution 
from what we now have, a new and a better system of public 
education, better adapted to the needs of child life and the 
needs of the scientific, democratic, and industrial world in 
which we live.

All progress sketched city progress. The reader probably 
has been impressed, before this, by the fact that practically 
all of the educational progress so far sketched as happening 
within the past half-century has been city progress. This, 
unfortunately for rural and: village education, is only too 
true. The firm establishment of the Massachusetts district 
system in the States, described in Chapter VIII, and the 
fastening on the schools, as a result of the early democratic 
movement, of a political instead of an educational basis for 
the selection of county and state school superintendents, as 
 
-P-A-G-E-508
466 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
described in Chapter VI, have together combined to deprive 
the rural and village schools of our country of any real edu- 
cational leadership, and to keep rural and village education 
from making the progress needed to meet the changed con- 
ditions of rural and village life. The cities, by the early 
elimination of their school districts (p. 237) and elective 
superintendents, have been able to draw to the management 
of their school systems the keenest thinkers and the 
most capable administrators engaged in educational work. 
In any line of work involving good organization and adapta- 
tion to rapidly changing conditions, nothing counts for so 
much as good leadership at the top. Of this our city school 
systems have for long had a monopoly. 
The rural and village schools of most of our States, cut off 
by law from securing such directive oversight from outside 
the county, and split 
up into thousands of 
little unrelated school 
districts, inspired by 
no unity of purpose 
and animated by no 
modern conception of 
educational work, have 
gone along without 
much change since the 
days of the sixties. Too 
often the little rural 
school stands to-day as a forlorn and shrunken Jandmark of 
what used to be an important rural social and educational 
institution. The textbooks have been revised and made 
uniform, to be sure, but the new books adopted have been 
books written primarily with city and not rural needs in 
view. A uniform course of study has been introduced, 
usually of the formal and drill type, but until recently 
with but little adaptation to rural needs. Normal-trained 
teachers, trained for city grade work, have been employed, 
but they have taught in terms of city needs, and have de-

  DESIRABLE EDUCATIONAL REORGANIZATIONS 467 
serted the rural school for a city position at the earliest 
opportunity. Some formal agriculture has recently been 
introduced into the course of study, but without provision 
for its supervision or adequate facilities for the work, and 
the city-trained teacher has usually not known what to do 
with it. The natural result is that our rural and village 
schools have remained bookish, their work unrelated to 
farm life, and their influence away from the farm. In con- 
sequence, country people have largely lost interest in them, 
and many have rented their farms and moved to town, in 
large part to obtain better educational advantages for their 
children. 
The new rural-life problem. In the mean time, since the 
days when the district system flourished in all its glory, and 
when eighty per cent of our people lived on the farm or in 
the little village and under rather simple living conditions, a 
vast and far-reaching revolution has taken place in the 
character of rural and village life. Inventions, labor-saving 
machinery, steam, electricity, the automobile, improved 
roads and means for transportation, rural mail delivery, the 
increase of conveniences and comforts, the rise of the cheap 
illustrated magazine, the circulation of the city daily paper, 
new world interests, new agricultural knowledge, new and 
more distant markets, commercial large-scale farming, the 
rapid rise of farm tenantry, the influx of the foreign-born 
into rural districts, the decay of the rural church, the dying 
out of the old rural social life, the decline of the old farm 
and village industries, the coming of a new type of tenant 
farmer, the cityward migration of the best and the poor- 
est of the rural population, the decline in interest in local 
government as larger national and world interests have 
come in, the intellectual revolution which has followed the 
industrial revolution, — all these have combined to change 
the whole face of the rural-life educational problem. 
To one who has given little or no thought to the subject 
it is hard to appreciate the great change in rural and village 
life which has taken place within the past half-century. It 
 
-P-A-G-E-510
  468 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
has been of far-reaching importance, and has touched every 
phase of rural life. Almost nothing is now as it used to be; 
almost nothing is done as it was a half-century ago. No- 
where has the social and industrial revolution wrought 
greater alterations than in the village or on the farm, and 
nowhere in our national life have the institutions of society 
made so little change to meet the new conditions. The re- 
sult has been the rapid development of a rural-life problem 
of large magnitude and of great social, economic, and edu- 
cational consequences, the solution of which lies largely in 
the provision of a new type of rural and village school, and 
the reorganization and redirection of rural education. 
Effect of these changes on the rural school. Under the 
stress of these new life conditions the old supervision by the 
district school trustees has completely broken down, while 
the expanding scope of all education to-day has left the little 
independent district too small a unit to make any adequate 
provision for modern rural or village educational needs. 
Only in remote districts or in isolated country places does the 
district system longer render any important service. The 
boy or girl on the farm or in the little village does not to-day 
receive a fair deal, and can never hope to receive as good an 
education as the city boy or girl so long as the outgrown dis- 
trict system continues to attempt the impossible, and so 
long as local political availability rather than educational 
training and competence rules in the selection of our county 
superintendents of schools. If there is any clear and unmis- 
takable lesson to be drawn from the administrative experi- 
ence of our city school systems, it is that the prime essen- 
tials for good school organization and administration are 
the abolition of school-district control, the unification of all 
schools under one board and one superintendent for admin- 
istration and supervision, larger units for school finance, 
and the entire elimination of party politics and local resi- 
dence requirements in the selection of superintendents of 
schools. If rural people could only understand how much 
better schools they could have, often for the same money, if

      DESIRABLE EDUCATIONAL REORGANIZATIONS 469 
for the district system they substituted a much larger unit 
for administration, the district system would soon be placed 
where many other outgrown institutions of society have 
been. 
That the district system is wasteful of effort and funds, 
results in great educational waste, is unprogressive to a high 
degree, leads to an unwise multiplication of little schools, 
does not provide adequately for the needs of country and 
village boys and girls, and that any marked general educa- 
tional progress is impossible under it, no longer admits of 
successful contradiction. Here and there one occasionally 
hears of a redirected rural or village school which is render- 
ing a real service, but these are few in number, and the 
progress made is too slow and too local to be of much value. 
The school-consolidation movement. Having started the 
mischief in the early days of its history, Massachusetts was 
the first State to try to remedy the matter. As early as

1869 this State enacted legislation permitting the consoli- 
lation of school districts, and in 1882 finally abolished the 
istrict system by law and restored the old town system 
rom which the district system had evolved (see drawing on 
. 42). After this abolition of the district system, the con- 
olidation of schools in Massachusetts became more rapid, 
d by about 1890 the idea spread to other States. Ohio,

470 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
in 1892, was the first State west of the Alleghenies to permit 
the union of two or more districts to form a consolidated 
school. Indiana began consolidation in 1901, and, largely 
due to its earlier abolition of the district system, the idea 
has made remarkable progress there. Many other States 
have experimented with the idea, though due to the diffi- 
culty of securing popular consent to the abandonment of a 
number of little districts, not much progress has been made 
in any strong district-system State. 
The essential features of the consolidation plan are an 
agreement, usually by vote at an election called for the pur- 
pose, to abandon three, four, five, or more little district 
schools; to erect instead a good modern school building at 
some central place; to haul the children by wagon or auto- 
mobile from their homes each day to this central school in 
the morning, and back home in the late afternoon; and at 
this central school to provide graded instruction, a partial 
or complete high school, agriculture, manual and domestic 
work, and many of the advantages now enjoyed by city 
children. Such a school can also be made a rural commu- 
nity-center school by adding an assembly hall, branch library 
room, and play-grounds. The picture on the preceding page 
shows such a school, containing six classrooms, an assem- 
bly hall, and library on the main floor, manual-training 
room, domestic-science room, an agricultural laboratory, 
toilet rooms, and indoor play-rooms in the basement. 
County-unit consolidation. The trouble with all such vol- 
untary consolidation of school districts lies in that consolida- 
tion proceedings are very hard to get started; district jeal- 
ousies and district inertia usually prevent the union district} 
being made large enough at the start, and but few volunta: 
unions can be secured. The left-hand figure in the drawin: 
on the opposite page shows the usual result under a volun 
tary, district-vote plan. The one consolidated district ma; 
have cost ten years of popular education, and then probabl; 
is too small. 
After nearly twenty years of trial and effort we now

not only that voluntary consolidation is inadequate and too 
slow, but that the new rural educational demands require 
not only more rapid but also more extensive reorganization 
than voluntary effort can secure. Only by the use of a unit 
as large as the county can the right kind of consolidation 
and the right type of school be provided, and this must be 
superimposed on the districts by general state law. Such a 
county-unit consolidation is shown in the right-hand figure 
of the drawing below. 
In this second case the county has been dealt with as a 
whole, and a county-unit school system has been substituted

472 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
the people of the county have elected a county board of 
education of five citizens, much as they elect a county 
board of five supervisors to oversee county expenses, build 
roads and bridges, and supervise the poor relief and county 
hospital and poor farm. This county board of education is 
exactly analogous toa city board of education, and has 
substantially the same powers. It selects and appoints a 
county superintendent of schools, being free to go anywhere 
and pay what they feel they can afford to get the man or 
woman they want for the office. With the aid of the 
county superintendent the county board consolidates the 
small scattered schools; erects larger and more modern 
buildings at central points; provides “teacherages” for 
each; changes district attendance lines as need for so doing 
arises; establishes kindergartens and high schools in con- 
nection with these central schools; can reorganize the school 
work by providing intermediate schools and departmental 
organization; may provide for a county high school of agri- 
culture and manual and household arts; establishes county 
health supervision and employs a traveling county school 
nurse; unites with the city in maintaining a parental school; 
and provides assistant county superintendents who act as 
supervisors of primary work, agriculture, household arts, 
music and drawing, etc. The board also employs all teach- 
ers and principals, builds and repairs all schoolhouses, levies 
one county school-tax for maintaining all schools, and other- 
wise conducts the schools of the county just as a city board 
of education conducts the schools of a city. About the only 
difference is that the schools are somewhat smaller than in 
the city, are farther apart, and that the education is di- 
rected toward the farm and rural-life and home needs instead 
of cityward and for city ends. 
What such a reorganization would mean. Such county- 
unit consolidation is by no means theoretical, but is found 
well-developed in Maryland and Utah, and in a more or less 
well-developed form in a number of Southern States. The 
school system which the United States organized for Porto
-P-A-G-E-515
DESIRABLE EDUCATIONAL REORGANIZATIONS 473 
Rico was organized on this plan. It has so many advan- 
tages, is so well adapted to meet the newrural-life problems, 
and under it rural education can so easily be redirected and 
enriched along the lines needed by rural and village boys and 
girls, that it or some modification of it now promises to be 
the coming form of educational organization for all territory 
lying outside the separately organized cities. 
With about ten to fifteen such consolidated schools to an 
average Middle-West county, instead of eighty to a hundred 
and twenty little insignificant schools, or something like 
eight to twelve hundred such consolidated schools to an aver- 
age State instead of eight to twelve thousand little district 
schools, the whole nature of rural life and education could be 
reshaped and redirected in a decade, and life on the farm 
and in the village would be given a new meaning. ( Such a 
change would also dispense with the need for the services of 
from 2500 to 3000 of the cheapest and most poorly edu- 
cated rural teachers of the State, as well as some 24,000 
to 36,000 district-school trustees — both of which would be 
educational gains of no small importance. In place of this 
army of school trustees, five citizens for each county, or 
about five hundred for a State, would manage much better 
than now all educational affairs of the rural and village 
schools. The Baltimore County, Maryland, county-unit 
school system, which has often been described, forms an 
interesting example of what can be accomplished by such an 
educational reorganization and redirection. 
After a few years under such a county-unit reorganization 
each county would have a small number of modern-type 
consolidated schools, rendering effective rural service, and, 
if properly located, serving as centers for the community 
life. High-school education, directed toward rural- and 
village-life needs, would become common for all, instead of 
as at present only for city and town children; adequate pro- 
fessional supervision would direct the work; and the curricu- 
lum could be tied up closely with the rich life experiences of 
rural boys and girls. What now seems so wonderful and so
-P-A-G-E-516
  474 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
exceptional, when carried through here and there by some 
especially intelligent and persuasive county superintendent, 
would then become the rule. The chief right of which the 
people of the rural districts would be deprived by such a re- 
organization would be the right to continue to mismanage 
and misdirect the education of their children by means of 
a system of school organization and administration the use- 
fulness of which has long passed by. 
IV. State Epucationat REORGANIZATION 
The chief state school officer. Closely related to the 
county educational reorganization which we have just 
sketched is the problem of state educational reorganization, 
which is fast coming to the front as another of our important 
educational reorganization questions. As was stated in 
Chapter VI, when we finally decided to establish the office of 
state school superintendent, we almost everywhere turned 
to popular election as the means for filling the office. As 
was explained on page 161, this at the time seemed the 
natural and proper method, as the office was then conceived 
of as being much like that of a State Auditor or State Land 
Agent. The early duties were almost wholly financial, sta- 
tistical, clerical, and exhortatory; the office required no 
special professional knowledge; and any citizen possessing 
energy, a strong personality, and a belief in general educa- 
tion at public expense could fill it. Many of the most suc- 
cessful early state school officers were ministers or lawyers. 
Since these earlier days the whole character of our popular 
education has changed, and education at public expense has 
been transformed into a great state, one might almost say, 
a great national interest. From a mere teaching institution 
the school has been raised to the foremost place as a con- 
structive agent in our democratic life. Public education 
to-day represents our greatest national undertaking, and, 
aside from the army, our most highly organized public ef- 
fort. Since the first establishment of state school systems 
permission has everywhere been changed to obligation;
-P-A-G-E-517
DESIRABLE EDUCATIONAL REORGANIZATIONS 475 
functions formerly entrusted to the districts have been 
taken over by the county or the State; new and far larger 
demands have been made on communities; new aims and 
purposes in instruction have been set up; and entirely new 
problems in organization, administration, instruction, sani- 
tation, and child welfare have been pushed to the front. 
The different State School Codes have become bulky, and 
school legislation has come to demand a professional know]- 
edge and an expertness of judgment which formerly was not 
required. The exhorter and the institute worker have come 
to be needed less and less, and the student of education and 
the trained administrator more and more. As a result, a 
well-thought-out state educational policy is now a necessity 
if intelligent progress is to be made. 
Election and appointment of experts. Only in the cities, 
though, has our administrative organization kept pace 
with our educational development along other lines. The 
school in its development, has outrun the thinking of those 
who direct it in district, county, and State. Though the 
expert and professional character of the office of State Super- 
intendent of Public Instruction is now somewhat generally 
recognized, the office itself, in most of our States, is still in a 
backward state of development, and realizes but a small 
fraction of its possible efficiency. In two thirds of our 
American States we still trust to political nomination, and 
the popular election of residents of the State willing to enter 
political candidacy for the office, to secure the head of our 
state school systems, though not employing the method to 
select the state geologist, state horticultural commissioner, 
state highway engineer, state entomologist, state forester, 
secretary of the state board of health, or president of the 
state university. 
There is no reason, though, except the historical one, why 
we should elect the head of the state school system and not 
elect the other experts mentioned, or why we should appoint 
them and not appoint the head of the state school system. 
The argument so often advanced that by so doing we would 
 
-P-A-G-E-518
  476 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
be taking the schools away from the people represents either 
sheer ignorance or political claptrap, as a comparison with 
the other experts mentioned at once reveals. What the 
people want is good government and efficient service from 
their public servants, and it is axiomatic in government that 
experts should be selected by an individual or by a small 
responsible body, and not elected by the people themselves. 
It is then the business of such an employing board to over- 
see the experts it selects, hold them strictly accountable for 
results, protect them in the discharge of their duties from 
injust attacks, and dismiss them whenever they cease to be 
competent. 
State school officer and president of university compared. 
The situation can perhaps best be seen if we compare the 
two offices of head of the state school system and president 
of the state university. Probably no position in the whole 
state public service has greater possibilities for constructive 
statesmanship than the position of state superintendent of 
public instruction in one of our American States. As a posi- 
tion it is, potentially at least, a more important one than 
that of the president of the state university. No president 
of an American state university ever exercised a greater in- 
fluence in a State or shaped to better advantage the des- 
tinies of the people by his labors than did Horace Mann in 
Massachusetts. 
The chief reason why one is appointed and the other 
elected is that the college and the university have their roots 
buried back in the Middle Ages, and appointment of the 
rector, chancellor, or president has always been the rule, 
whereas the office of state superintendent of schools is a 
wholly modern creation. When our American States 
founded their state universities they organized them after 
the pattern of the ages; when they created the new office of 
head of their newly evolved democratic school system they 
followed the new democratic idea of the people electing 
every public official. The governing body for the university 
(board of trustees, or regents) has often been elected by
-P-A-G-E-519
  DESIRABLE EDUCATIONAL REORGANIZATIONS 477 
the people, but the president and professors have always 
been recognized as expert state servants, and appointed 
without reference to residence, politics, race, sex, or religion. 
Under such a plan our universities have made wonderful 
progress. Imagine the result, though, if you can, had the 
people nominated and elected, along political lines and al- 
ways from among the citizens of the State, the president of 
the state university as they do the head of the state school 
system, and the heads of departments in the university as 
they do the heads of the county school systems in the State. 
It is hard to conceive what Republican Chemistry, Demo- 
cratic Latin, Prohibitionist English, or Union-Labor History, 
would be like. 
That the office of head of the state school system has not 
measured up with that of the presidency of the state univer- 
sity is a matter of common knowledge, and it has not done 
so largely because the office has for so long been afflicted 
with the blight of partisan politics; been one of the lowest- 
salaried positions within the gift of the State; and because 
political expediency, rather than any educational standard, 
has been the measuring stick used in selecting candidates for 
the position. The people seldom have an opportunity to 
vote for a really good man for the office, as the best men 
usually cannot be induced to become candidates. Of a few 
States where the office is elective this at times has not been 
true, but not of many, and usually not for long in any State. 
In some of our States the traditions of the office have settled 
down to merely that of a retiring job for some old and rea- 
sonably successful practitioner from the ranks, and in con- 
sequence has commanded but little respect or authority. 
Lack of a consecutive state educational policy. As a 
result, few of our States to-day reveal, in their educational 
and legislative history, any evidence of having followed for 
any length of time a well-thought-out educational policy. 
Often the state oversight has been of a distinctively laissez- 
faire type, the officer acting largely as a clerk, statistical 
agent, tax distributor, and institute lecturer. School legis-
-P-A-G-E-520
  478 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
lation has represented expediency, has been of the patch- 
work variety, and a conception of the State as an active and 
energetic agent for the improvement of educational condi- 
tions and the advancement of the public welfare has been 
entirely lacking. 
When we turn to the State of Massachusetts we get an 
example of the opposite of these tendencies and results. 
Thanks perhaps to her strong aristocratic leanings, when 
the State Board of Education was created, in 1837, the 
State provided for the appointment by it of a Secretary to 
act as head of the school system, and not for the popular 
election of a chief state school officer. The result was the 
appointment of Horace Mann as the first Secretary, he 
holding the position, despite abuse and bitter attacks, until 
his election to succeed John Quincy Adams as a Member of 
Congress from Massachusetts, twelve years later. Had he 
been compelled to submit himself to the people every two 
or four years for reélection, there were times when he could 
not have been reélected, and had the office been an elective 
instead of an appointive one it is more than probable that 
Mann would have remained a lawyer and never been known 
as a school administrator. 
Largely as a result of the Massachusetts conception of the 
importance of the chief state educational office, the leader- 
ship of that State in educational progress has been one of 
the marked features of our educational history. Since the 
establishment of the office of Secretary, in 1837, but nine 
persons have held the office up to the present time, and all 
have been educational leaders and statesmen of a high order. 
The present incumbent (1919; now called Commissioner of 
Education) was called to the position in 1916 from the head 
of the school system of Maine; his predecessor from a profes- 
sorship of school administration at Teachers College, Colum- 
bia; and his predecessor from the position of assistant super- 
intendent of the schools of Boston. One who has read the 
preceding chapters of this book cannot-help but be im- 
pressed with the number of important educational advances
-P-A-G-E-521
  DESIRABLE EDUCATIONAL REORGANIZATIONS 479 
which had their origin in Massachusetts, and the State has 
also been a leader in much other educational legislation 
which has not been mentioned. Though small in size and 
possessing no great natural resources, and for the past 
seventy-five years being slowly buried under a constantly 
increasing avalanche of foreign-born peoples who have cor- 
rupted her politics, diluted her citizenship, and often de- 
stroyed the charm of her villages, the State has persisted in 
a constructive educational policy which has been in large 
part her salvation. Had the selection of leaders for her 
schools been left to politics, it is hardly probable that the 
results would have been the same. 
Democracy’s need for leadership. No type of govern- 
ment has such need for trained leadership at the top as has 
a democracy, and no branch of the public service in a de- 
mocracy is fraught with greater opportunities for construc- 
tive statesmanship than is public education. By it the 
next generation is moulded and the hopes and aspirations 
and ideals of the next generation are formed. To rise above 
office routine to the higher levels of constructive statesman- 
ship is not easy, and calls for a high type of educational 
leader. Yet this higher level of leadership is what a state 
department of education should primarily represent. The 
improvement of society and the advancement of the public 
welfare through education is perhaps the greatest business 
of the State. A state board of education to determine poli- 
cies and select leaders, and a chief state school officer (state 
superintendent, commissioner of education, or whatever 
title he may be given) to carry policies into execution and 
think in constructive terms for the schools, should be the 
center up to which and down from which ideas for the im- 
provement of public education should come. 
In both county and state the demand to-day is for intelli- 
gent professional leadership, that our people may receive 
greater return for the money they put into their schools, and 
that the children in them may receive a better-directed 
education than they are now receiving. The important
-P-A-G-E-522
  480 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
steps in the process of securing these results consist in fol- 
lowing the lines for reorganization which have been set forth 
in this chapter — namely, changing from guess-work to 
scientific procedure; the reorganization of school work to 
secure larger opportunities and greater effectiveness; the 
reorganization and redirection of rural and village as well as 
city educational procedure; the abolition of the outgrown 
district system for a larger administrative unit; the elim- 
ination of politics and popular election in the selection of 
experts; and the concentration of larger authority in the 
hands of those whose business it is to guard the rights and 
advance the educational welfare of our children. 
National aid and oversight. Up to the close of the Civil 
War all our development had been by state action, except 
as the National Government had given land to the States 
for common schools and for a seminary of learning, and in 
1862 had endowed with national land a college of agriculture 
and mechanic arts in each State. In 1866, at the first meet- 
ing of the new National Association of School Superintend- 
ents, afterwards the Department of Superintendence of 
the National Education Association, Mr. E. E. White, then 
State Commissioner of Education for Ohio, read a paper on 
a “National Bureau of Education.” In response to a reso- 
lution then adopted Hon. James A. Garfield, then a Member 
of Congress from Ohio, introduced and sponsored a bill in 
Congress to create such a Bureau “‘to collect statistics and 
facts concerning the condition and progress of education in 
the several States and Territories, and to diffuse information 
respecting the organization and management of schools and 
school systems and methods of teaching.” Instead, Con- 
gress, in 1867, created a National Department of Education, 
but two years later reduced the Department to the rank of a 
Bureau in the Interior Department, where it has since re- 
mained. Henry Barnard was appointed the first Commis- 
sioner, and William T. Harris held the office for seventeen 
years. Along the lines originally indicated the Bureau has 
tendered important service to the States, but now that our 
 
-P-A-G-E-523
  
    
    
   
                            
   
                           DESIRABLE EDUCATIONAL REORGANIZATIONS 481 
educational problems have assumed so many national as- 
pects a Bureau of such limited scope is utterly inadequate 
to render the type of service we need to-day. 
While the school systems which we have gradually de- 
veloped are state school systems, some of the educational 
problems with which we have recently come face to face are 
too large, too extensive in their scope, and too far-reaching 
in their consequences to permit us to leave them longer to 
the States, unaided, to solve. State action, even at its best, 
is too slow and too uncertain, while some of our most press- 
ing problems to-day are national in character and demand 
general and immediate action. The World War has brought 
forcibly to our attention some of our most serious weak- 
nesses, and the need for early and general action stands re- 
vealed. This we are not likely to get, however, unless it is 
action by the Nation, such as has already been taken for the 
improvement of rural home-life, agriculture, and vocational 
education — action which will stir the States to immediate 
movement along similar lines, and under national guidance 
and control. 
A pressing need to-day is that our national government 
shall undertake a national campaign to eliminate some of 
our national weaknesses and dangers. We must resolutely 
set to work, during the respite from the immigrant flood 
which the World War promises for a time to give us, to 
Americanize the foreign-born in our midst. We must abolish 
illiteracy, and make English our one language. A thorough 
health and physical education program should be instituted 
everywhere. Continuation schools should be provided 
generally, that will extend at least part-time voca- 
tional training up to the age of eighteen. The utter inade- 
quacy of our present scheme for rural and village education 
stands revealed as never before, and the rebuilding and 
revitalizing of rural education is too large an undertaking to 
be made less than a national movement. The salaries paid 
teachers are inadequate, as is also the training for teaching. 
To meet these demands in any truly adequate manner
-P-A-G-E-524
  482 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
calls for national aid, national supervision, and a national 
program of work. To secure this we need to transform, as 
is proposed in a bill now (1919) before Congress, our Na- 
tional Bureau of Education at Washington into a National 
Department of Education, and place all our different na- 
tional educational efforts and aid under the direction of this 
Department. We must in future study our larger educa- 
tional problems from a national point of view, rather than 
from a local one; we must extend sufficient national aid and 
direction to the States to stimulate them to activity; and we 
must enable them to cope adequately with the problems at 
hand.

CHAPTER XV 
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND PROBLEMS 
I. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED 
The national system evolved. In the chapters preceding 
this one we have traced, in some detail, the evolution of our 
American public schools from the days of their infancy to 
the present, and have shown the connection between our 
more pressing present-day problems and our evolution dur- 
ing the past. Starting with a few little church school sys- 
tems, founded as an outgrowth of Reformation fervor and 
convictions, we have, in the course of nearly three centuries 
of educational evolution, gradually transformed the school 
from an instrument of the church to a civil institution, and 
have built up what are in effect forty-eight different state 
school systems. While these vary somewhat in their form 
of organization and the scope of the system provided, they 
nevertheless have so much in common, are actuated by so 
many of the same national purposes, and follow so closely 
the same guiding principles, that we may easily say that we 
have evolved what is in spirit, if not in legal form, a national 
system of public education. This we feel, due to the thor- 
oughly native character of the evolution which has taken 
place, is reasonably well suited to the needs of a great demo- 
cratic society such as our own. 
In the course of this long evolution, despite much conflict 
and irregular development in different parts of our country, 
we have at last come to a somewhat general acceptance of 
certain fundamental principles of action. These may now 
be said to have become fixed, not only in our traditions but 
in our laws and court decisions as well, and to represent the 
foundations upon which our public educational systems 
rest. In this final chapter it may be well to review briefly 
 
-P-A-G-E-530
  488 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
some of the more important of these guiding principles 
before taking up the problems which lie just ahead. 
The essential nature of education. To the enthusiasts of 
the Protestant: Reformation we owe the idea that the educa- 
tion of all is essential to the well-being of the State; that it is 
the duty of each parent to educate his child; and that the 
State may enforce this duty by appropriate legislation. 
First conceived of wholly for the welfare of the religious 
State, and so enforced in the Massachusetts Laws of 1642 
and 1647, in the church-period legislation of the central colo- 
nies, and somewhat in the apprenticeship legislation of the 
southern colonies, the idea of the right of the State to enforce 
education to advance the welfare of the State in time became 
a fixed idea in the New England colonies, Rhode Island ex- 
cepted, and from there was gradually spread, by the migra- 
tion of New England people, all over the northeastern quar- 
ter of the United States. Becoming firmly established there 
by the middle of the nineteenth century, the idea spread, 
in the course of time, over the entire Union, and is now an 
accepted principle of action in all our American States. 
In establishing schools of its own to enforce the obligation 
of education, the State has done so, not so much because it 
can educate better than can parents, though in most cases 
this is true, but because by itself taking charge of the con- 
duct of schools the State can enforce better the obligation 
it imposes that each child shall be educated. Neither does 
the State establish schools because by state codperative 
effort they can be established and conducted more economi- 
cally than by private agencies, but rather that by so doing it 
may better exercise the State’s inherent right to enforce a 
type of education looking specifically to the preservation 
and improvement of the State. With the passage of time, 
the growth of our Nation, and the extension of the suffrage 
to more and more diverse elements in our population, we 
have come to see clearly that an uneducated citizenship is a 
public peril, and to insist more strongly than before on the 
exercise of this fundamental right of the State. A natural
-P-A-G-E-531
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND PROBLEMS 489 
corollary of this right to require education for the protec- 
tion and improvement of the State is the right of the State 
to provide inspection to see that the obligation the State 
imposes is being fulfilled, and supervision to lead to the 
improvement of what is being done. 
The right to tax to maintain. The provision of schools to 
enforce the obligation imposed by the State, though, re- 
quires money, and the better the schools provided the more 
they are likely to cost. Even state supervision of education, 
were the provision of schools left entirely to private or reli- 
gious initiative, also would cost something. This cost must 
be defrayed from public funds, and these must come from 
individual, group, or general taxation. 
Just how schools should be supported must be determined 
by a consideration as to their nature. If they are ouly or 
largely of personal or local benefit, such as telephone service, 
street-lighting, pavements, or streets, then they should be 
supported by individual or local taxation. Being conceived, 
though, as essential to the welfare of the State as a whole, 
then their support should be by the general taxation of all, 
and not from taxes or fees paid by the parents of the children 
educated. The establishment of this principle, that the 
wealth of the State must educate the children of the State, 
required time and effort, for it virtually meant the confisca- 
tion of a portion of the fruits of the labor of all men, and in 
proportion as they by hard labor and thrift had been able to 
accumulate a surplus, and the use of the part so confiscated 
to educate the children of the State, regardless of whether 
or not the particular parents of the children educated had 
any surplus wealth to be so confiscated. 
This is an essential state service to which all owners of 
property must be subject, and no man can expect to escape 
his share for support by sending his children to a private or 
parochial school. This of course he is free to do, as we have 
so far in our history not seen any reason for limiting this 
right of choice, but the exercise of such freedom and choice 
cannot be expected to relieve him of his proper share for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-532
  490 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
support of so essential a state service as public education. 
Equally might he claim exemption from taxation for the 
maintenance of police because he is a law-abiding citizen, 
from the support of the fire department because he has built 
his house of concrete, and from taxation to purchase and 
maintain parks because he has attractive grounds around 
his home and does not visit the parks maintained by the 
public. 
How far the State may go. How far the State may goin 
levying taxation to provide general educational advantages 
is another matter which we have decided shall be left to the 
State to determine. Our government is a government by 
majority rule, and we have gradually established it as a 
principle of public policy that what the majority, acting 
through its accredited representatives, once decide to be for 
the public welfare, can be ordered and provided. When this 
involves new lines of action not only new laws, but at times 
amendments to the constitution of the State are necessary, 
but, once a clear majority has decided that something in the 
interest of the public welfare should or should not be done, 
it is not difficult to alter whatever laws or constitutional 
provisions stand in the way. When this has been done the 
courts have uniformly decided that the will of the majority, 
so registered, shall prevail. The early school taxation laws, 
the laws for the extension of the high school, the provision of 
state normal schools, the first compulsory attendance laws, 
free textbook laws, laws for medical inspection and health 
supervision, — these and others have been tested in and 
upheld by the courts. 
So it may be safely asserted to have become an estab- 
lished principle of our American educational policy that the 
State may provide, or order provided, if it deems that the 
welfare of the State will be better preserved or advanced, 
whatever form of educational effort, type of school, aspect of 
inspection or instruction, or extension of education may to 
it seem wise to add. The needs of our democracy are alone 
the test, and these needs are to be determined by majority
-P-A-G-E-533
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND PROBLEMS 491 
action and in the majority interest, and not imposed by the 
rule or to meet the needs of a class. 
There is every reason to feel that this fundamental princi- 
ple of action has not as yet in any way reached the limits of 
its application, but rather that the future is almost certain 
to see a great extension of educational advantages into new 
directions to meet the needs of classes of our people not now 
adequately provided for. In the fields of night schools, va- 
cation schools, play-grounds and directed play, community- 
center activities, adult education, public music, civic-welfare 
education, health supervision, child welfare, school and uni- 
versity extension, and vocational guidance, to mention a few 
of the more certain directions of future state educational 
activity, we are almost sure to see marked extensions of the 
right of the State, in the interests of the welfare of the State, 
exercised to provide or to order provided. 
Schools to afford equal opportunity. Another principle 
which we have firmly established in our educational policy 
is that the schools provided shall afford not only equal op- 
portunity for all in any one class or division of the school, . 
but also that full opportunity for promising youths to rise 
shall be offered by the State, and that this opportunity, as 
well, shall be equally free and open to all. In other words, 
we decided early, and as a part of the great democratic 
movement in the early part of the nineteenth century, that 
we would institute a thoroughly democratic school system, 
and not in any way copy the aristocratic and monarchical 
two-class school systems of European States. Accordingly 
we early provided in our state constitutions and in our laws 
for free public schools, equally open to all. As soon as pos- 
sible we abolished the rate-bill and the fuel tax, extended 
the free-school term, and provided free school supplies. We 
replaced the tuition academy with the free public high 
school, and superimposed it onto the common school we 
had developed to form an educational ladder which ambi- 
tious youths might climb. On top of the high school we 
superimposed the state college and university, similarly 
 
-P-A-G-E-534
  492 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
tuition free. We freed the schools from the pauper taint, 
and opened the same or equivalent opportunities to girls as_ 
well as boys. To make the school as common in its advan- 
tages as possible we also early eliminated all trace of sec- 
tarian control. 
As a result we have to-day, in each of our American 
States, a school system free, non-sectarian, and equally open 
to all children of the State, and which any child may attend, 
at the expense of the State, as long as he can profitably par- 
take of the educational advantages provided. To reach an 
increasing number of the State’s children, and to retain 
them longer in school, the State is continually broadening 
its educational system by adding new schools and new types 
of education, so that more may find in the schools educa- 
tional advantages suited to their life needs. In this way 
we widen the educational pyramid by increasing the oppor- 
tunities for more and more to rise, and thus secure a more 
intelligent and a more enlightened democracy. Under an 
autocratic form of government this would not be desirable, 
but in a democracy it is a prime necessity. 
State may compel attendance. The State, having ad- 
judged the provision of education to be a public necessity, 
to preserve and advance the welfare of the State, the natu- 
ral corollary of such a position is the right of the State to 
compel children to attend and to partake of the educational 
advantages which have been provided. The State may also 
compel their parents, by severe penalties if need be, to see 
that their children come to school for the period adjudged 
by the State as the minimum term and minimum number of 
years to be accepted. We came to this position slowly and 
hesitantly, but to-day we may be said to have arrived at the 
point where we hold it the right of the State to compel each 
child to attend school every day the schools are in session 
and he is able to attend, and for a period extending up to at 
least fourteen years of age, with every probability that in the 
near future it will be extended up to sixteen. Having con- 
ceived a common school education, at least, to be the birth-
-P-A-G-E-535
  FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND PROBLEMS 493 
right of every American boy and girl, the State has finally 
stepped in to see that the children of the State are not pre- 
vented from obtaining their birthright. Nor can the State 
admit the needs of the parents for the labor of their children 
as an excuse for non-attendance, though the rejection of such 
a plea involves obligations on the part of the State to pro- 
vide, in the form of poor-relief, the earnings of which the 
State by the exercise of compulsion deprives the parent. 
The State may set standards. Any conception of the 
State as an educational agent, interested in seeing that 
schools are provided to preserve itself and to advance its 
welfare, naturally involves the right of the State to fix the 
minimum standards below which it will not allow any com- 
munity or private or parochial school to fall. While either 
too much liberty or too much state oversight may result in 
weakness in the local school systems maintained, some state 
oversight and control must be exercised if strength is to be 
developed. In all such matters as types of schools and 
classes which must be maintained; the language in which the 
instruction is given; length of term to be provided; the care 
of children which must be exercised; the hygienic conditions; 
and the minimum rate of tax for schools which must be 
raised locally, it is essentially the business of the State to fix 
the minimum types, lengths, and amounts which will be 
permitted, and through the exercise of state inspection and 
state penalties to enforce these minimum demands. This 
we have clearly settled both as a right and a duty in our 
laws and our court decisions. It is also the right, as well as 
the duty of the State, to raise these minima from time to 
time, as changing conditions and new educational needs may 
seem to require or as the increasing wealth of the State will 
permit, and without waiting until all communities are able 
to make such advances. To do this will often involve 
reciprocal obligations on the part of the State, but these the 
State must expect and be prepared to meet. 
Carrying the idea still further, we have also come to ac- 
cept as an established principle that it should be the business
-P-A-G-E-536
  494 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
of the State to formulate and carry out a constructive edu- 
cational policy for the advancement of the welfare of the 
State by means of public education. Instead of being a 
passive tax-gatherer, distributor of funds, and lawgiver, the 
State, if it is to meet the educational problems of a modern 
world, must become an active, energetic agent, working for 
the moral, social, hygienic, industrial, and intellectual ad- 
vancement of its people. The formulation of minimum stand- 
ards from time to time, the protection of these standards from 
being lowered by any private or sectarian agency, and the 
stimulation of communities within the State to additional 
educational activity, these have now come to be accepted 
both as fundamental rights and duties of the State. 
Public education not exclusive. Unlike France, we have 
never been driven to the necessity of making public educa- 
tion exclusive. Instead, we have felt that the competition 
of private and parochial schools, if better than the public 
schools, is good for the public schools. Especially in the 
line of higher education have we profited by allowing the 
freest competition between the privately endowed colleges 
and the state universities. As a result such privately en- 
dowed institutions as Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Princeton, 
Johns Hopkins, Tulane, Chicago, and Stanford have fallen 
in whole-heartedly with our state and national purposes 
and have become really national universities. 
On the other hand, our States have not as yet exercised 
their accepted rights of supervision, and often have allowed 
a competition from private and religious schools which was 
not warranted by any ideas of state welfare. Ina few of our 
American States this situation has recently been taken in 
hand, and standards have been established which are clearly 
within the right of the State to establish. These involve 
the requirement of instruction in the English language, the 
provision of schools at least as good as the public schools 
of the same community, and full codperation with the public 
school authorities in such matters as compulsory school 
attendance and statistical reports. These are legitimate
-P-A-G-E-537
Pe eee FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND PROBLEMS 495 
demands of the State; they have been upheld by our courts, 
and they should everywhere be enforced by our American 
Commonwealths. 
The present conviction of our people. Slowly but cer- 
tainly public education has been established as a great 
state, one might almost say, a great national, interest of the 
American people. They have conceived the education of 
all as essential to the well-being of the State, and have estab- 
lished state systems of public education to enforce the idea. 
The principle that the wealth of the State must educate 
the children of the State has been firmly established. The 
schools have been made free and equally open to all; educa- 
tion has been changed from a charity to a birthright; and a 
thoroughly democratic educational ladder has everywhere 
been provided. The corollary to free education, in the form 
of compulsion to attend, is now beginning to be systemati- 
cally enforced. The school term has been lengthened, the 
instruction greatly enriched, new types of classes and schools 
provided, and new extensions of educational opportunity 
begun. 
As a result of our long evolution we have finally developed 
a thoroughly native series of American state school systems, 
bound together by one common purpose, guided by the same 
set of established principles, and working for the same na- 
tional ends. In consequence it may now be regarded as a 
settled conviction of our American people that the provision 
of a liberal system of free non-sectarian public schools, in 
which equal opportunity is provided for all, even though 
many different types of schools may be needed, is not only 
an inescapable obligation of our States to their future citi- 
zens, but also that nothing which the State does for its 
people contributes so much to the moral uplift, to a higher 
civic virtue, and to increased economic returns to the State 
as does a generous system of free public schools.  
-P-A-G-E-538
496 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
II. Epucation as A Constructive Toon 
Our characteristic native development. We have evolved 
these fundamental principles of action, as has been said, only 
after long public discussion and conflict. Time was re- 
quired to set forth the arguments and convince a majority 
of our people as to the desirability of accepting them, and 
still more time to permit the necessary extension from an 
acceptance in principle to an acceptance in reality. Still 
more, after their acceptance in a few States or a section of 
the Union, more time was required to permit the spread and 
general acceptance of the ideas by our people as a whole. 
As a result we have made progress but slowly and irregu- 
larly, and often a generation has been required to familiarize 
ourselves with and accept some new idea which has been a 
demonstrated success in other States or other lands. 
Our educational development, as a result, has been slow 
and thoroughly native, and ideas reaching us from abroad 
have been carefully examined, questioned, tried, worked 
over, and adapted to our conditions before they have met 
with any general acceptance among our people. Conse- 
quently our American school systems are thoroughly “of 
the people, for the people, and by the people.” This is both 
their strength and their weakness. They are thoroughly 
democratic in spirit and thoroughly representative of the 
best in our American development, but they also represent 
largely average opinion as to what ought to be accomplished 
and how things ought to be done. There are many improve- 
ments which ought to be carried out without delay, and 
which if made would add greatly to the effectiveness of our 
schools and consequently to our national strength, but which 
we shall probably have to wait for until a new generation 
arises, and achieve then only after a long process of popular 
agitation and discussion in which those in favor of the 
changes have out-argued those opposed. 
National initiative without responsibility. The same 
“show me” spirit which has characterized our slow educa-
-P-A-G-E-539
re re ner ere eee 
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND PROBLEMS 497 
tional development has also characterized our instruction. 
We have thrown both teachers and pupils largely on their 
own resources, with the result that either the instruction has 
been very poor or both teachers and pupils have made marked 
development in initiative and in ability to care for them- 
selves. The most prominent characteristic of many of our 
schools has been the former, but the latter has characterized 
so many schools, and so thoroughly characterizes our private 
and public life, that as a Nation we have gained a world- 
wide reputation for initiative and imagination and the abil- 
ity to carry through successfully large undertakings. Liv- 
ing under a form of government which has given us large 
freedom both to commit mistakes or to make successes, not 
afflicted by a bureaucratic government which has imposed a 
uniformity destructive of initiative, with plenty of elbow- 
room for the man possessing ideas and energy, always willing 
to learn, thoroughly democratic in spirit, possessed of large 
common sense, able to see means and ends and how to relate 
the two, and willing to follow the leadership of any one of 
ideas and force or to lead ourselves, we have developed inde- 
pendence of action as a national characteristic. In no other 
country have the results of national attitudes, national 
training, and national restraint or freedom shown to better 
advantage in the general intelligence, poise, good judgment, 
moral strength, individual initiative, and productive capac- 
ity of a people than with us. 
These characteristics have carried us along very well up to 
recent times, and all that is valuable in them we ought to 
retain. Certainly the splendid initiative of our youth, never 
shown to better advantage than during the participation of 
this Nation in the recent World War, is something which we 
cannot afford to lose. We have, however, lacked somewhat 
in state and national effectiveness because we exercise our 
initiative in such an individual manner. It has been largely 
a case of each fellow for himself, and only in cases of national 
emergency or danger have we codperated well. The virtue 
which we now need to develop to supplement this splendid  
-P-A-G-E-540
  498 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
national trait is a stronger sense of intelligent responsibil- 
ity for the common welfare, as expressed in some form of 
self-imposed democratic discipline. Our most prominent 
characteristic has been a democratic independence and the 
ability to take care of ourselves. The most prominent char- 
acteristic of the German boy, on the other hand, has been a 
blind obedience to the authority of the State. In between 
the two the English and French boys have preserved their 
initiative and at the same time learned to respect authority 
and to shoulder responsibility, and the results of this training 
were well brought out in the recent World War. The Amer- 
ican boy showed splendid initiative and daring, but was res- 
tive under discipline; the German boy lacked individual 
initiative when forced to take care of himself, but did well 
what he was told to do; the French and English boys exhib- 
ited, in a high degree, both initiative and an intelligent sen- 
sitiveness to leadership which contributed much to the suc- 
cess of their common cause. 
Probably one of our greatest future educational problems 
is that of striving to increase our governmental effectiveness 
on the one hand and individual responsibility for good gov- 
ernment on the other, while at the same time retaining our 
democratic life and that training which develops initiative, 
force, and foresight. Just where the division between per- 
sonal initiative and national discipline is to be drawn is a 
question that must be determined somewhat by the demands 
made by the welfare of the State. If good citizenship is the 
fundamental problem, then a large place must be found for 
individual initiative, and much must be left to self-imposed 
control. If, on the other hand, the safety of the State is the 
important consideration, then imposed discipline must take 
precedence over individual initiative and liberty of action. 
Though we now face no great danger from the outside which 
seems to imperil the safety of the State, still, since the wel- 
fare of any State must depend both on civil order and secur- 
ity, education in a democracy must of necessity combine 
both liberty of action and self-imposed discipline.
-P-A-G-E-541
  FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND PROBLEMS 499 
Why our educational problem is difficult. Contrasted 
with a highly organized nation, such as Germany was before 
she attacked civilization and plunged the world into war, 
we seem feeble in our ability to organize and push forward a 
constructive national program for development and prog- 
ress. There the State was highly organized; the people 
homogeneous; the officials well educated, and selected by 
careful service tests; national policies were painstakingly 
thought out and promulgated; the schools were effectively 
organized into uniformly good institutions for the advance- 
ment of the national interests; the teachers were carefully 
trained in state institutions, and made into parts of a na- 
tional army expected to follow the flag loyally; the Church 
was nationalized, and in part supported by the Govern- 
ment; religion was taught in all schools, and the weight of 
religion and the backing of the priesthood were used to sup- 
port the State; and a great national army was maintained 
and used as an educative force for nationalizing all elements 
and training the people in obedience and respect for law and 
order. 
With us, on the other hand, we have only our schools. 
Our government is what the people want it to be — good, 
bad, or indifferent. While in a monarchy the ruling govern- 
ment may be much better than the people could provide for 
themselves, ina democracy this can never be. The thinking 
men and students of fundamental questions in any form of 
government are relatively few. In a monarchy these are 
usually selected to rule; in a democracy they constitute a 
minority seldom selected for office and often possessing but 
little power to mould majority opinion. Even in our uni- 
versities professors work with a view to improving the future 
rather than the present. The classroom is often a genera- 
tion ahead of public opinion. Everywhere our public offi- 
cials are of the people, and representative of majority ideas. 
Though our States and the National Government have re- 
cently assumed many new functions, looking toward more 
centralized control and better public administration, each
-P-A-G-E-542
500 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
increase in state control has been objected to vigorously by 
those who fear that the coming of bureaucratic efficiency 
may reduce us to mediocrity and rob us of some of our splen- 
did initiative. A national religion is inconceivable with us, 
and a great national army we do not need or want. We are 
thrown back, then, upon our systems of public education, 
the public press, and our political life as the great moulding 
and unifying forces in our most heterogeneous national life, 
and of these three the school easily stands first as the force 
which ultimately shapes the other two. Upon the public 
school teacher, then, and upon those who direct the policies 
of our schools, in reality rests the burden of the future of our 
free democratic institutions and the welfare of our national 
life. The children of to-day are the voters and rulers of to- 
morrow, and to prepare them well or ill for the responsibili- 
ties of citizenship and government rests almost entirely with 
the schools of our Nation. What progress we as a people 
make in national character from generation to generation is 
largely determined by how well the public school has seen 
national needs and been guided by that largeness of vision 
without which but little progress in national welfare is ever 
made. 
The problems our schools face. In the schools our people, 
adult as well as the young, must be trained for literacy, and 
the English language must be made our common national 
speech. There, too, the youth of our land, girls now as well 
as boys, must be trained for responsible citizenship in our 
democracy, and so filled with the spirit and ideals of our 
national life that they will be willing to dedicate their lives 
to the preservation and advancement of our national wel- 
fare. In our high schools and colleges the more promising 
of our youth must be trained for leadership and service in 
the State, given a vision of our world place and relationships, 
and prepared for constructive service along the lines of the 
highest and best of our national traditions in statesmanship, 
business, science, and government. In our common schools 
and in special schools those who labor must be trained for 
   
-P-A-G-E-543
  FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND PROBLEMS 501 
vocational efficiency, and given a sense of their responsibility 
for promoting the national welfare. The school, too, must 
take upon itself new duties in teaching health, promoting 
healthful sports, training in manly and womanly ways, in- 
culcating thrift, teaching the principles underlying the con- 
servation of our human and material national resources, and 
in preparing the rising generation for a more intelligent use 
of their leisure time. This last involves training for appreci- 
ation and intelligent enjoyment by developing better the 
musical, artistic, and literary tastes of our people. 
Along with all these important aspects of the educational 
process must come the development generally among our 
people of a higher moral tone, that as a Nation we may rise 
and be equal to the advanced moral conceptions which we in 
recent years have set up in our international dealings. Our 
Nation has recently been accorded a prominent position in 
world affairs because of the high moral impulses which have 
characterized the various “notes” and addresses of our 
President on questions relating to the World War; because 
we took our place beside the Western Nations fighting in 
defense of civilization in the greatest crisis faced in a thou- 
sand years; and because our “boys” in Europe behaved in 
a manner which won the admiration of the people of every 
nation they went among. Asa result the very name Amer- 
ica stands, now, for a high and rigid code of personal and 
national honor, of which every American youth should not 
only be proud, but should also be made to feel that he must 
jealously guard in his thoughts, his actions, and his life. 
The same code of national honor must now be transferred 
and lived up to in our manners, our business relationships, 
and our international dealings with all other peoples through- 
out the world. 
National morality is always an outgrowth of the personal- 
ity, morality, and teaching of a people, and this in turn rests 
on proper knowledge, humane ideals, the proper training of 
the instincts, the development of a will to do right, good 
physical vigor, and, to a certain degree, upon economic
-P-A-G-E-544
  502 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
competence. Mere moral or religious instruction will not 
answer, because it usually does not get beneath the surface of 
the problem. No nation has shown more completely the 
futility of mere religious instruction to produce morality 
than has Germany, where religious instruction was univer- 
sally required. The problem is how to influence and direct 
__ the deeper sources of the life of a people, so that the national 
characteristics it is desired to display to the world will be 
brought out because the schools have instilled into every 
child the conceptions and attitudes it is desired to see shine 
forth. With the best of the young manhood of England, 
France, and Germany gone, for a generation to come, the 
call for our Nation to assume a new position in international 
affairs is one we cannot refuse to meet. Where America will 
stand in the affairs of the world, and the place it will occupy 
in history a century hence, will be determined largely by the 
ability we display in shouldering the new tasks, and in sub- 
ordinating every personal ambition and every sordid motive 
to the great ideas of international right and justice, sterling 
national worth, and service to mankind. In the words of 
Lincoln we must “have faith that right makes might, and 
in that faith to the end dare to do our duty as we understand 
it.” How we understand our duty, and how large the duty 
appears, ultimately goes back to the schools and the homes 
of this Nation. 
Education a constructive national tool. Education to-day 
has become the great constructive tool of civilization. A 
hundred years ago it was of little importance in the life of a 
Nation; to-day it is the prime essential to good government 
and national progress. As people are freed from autocratic 
rule the need for general education becomes painfully evi- 
dent. In the hands of an uneducated people democracy is a 
dangerous instrument. In Russia, Mexico, and the Central 
American “republic” we see what a democracy results in in 
the hands of an uneducated people. There, too often, the 
revolver instead of the ballot box is used to settle public 
issues, and instead of an orderly government under law we
-P-A-G-E-545
  
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND PROBLEMS 503 
find injustice and anarchy. When we freed Cuba, Porto 
Rico, and the Philippines from Spanish rule we at once insti- 
tuted a general system of public education as a safeguard to 
the liberty we had established in these Islands, and to educa- 
tion we added sanitation and courts of justice as important 
auxiliary agencies. The good results of our work in these 
Islands will for long be a monument to our political foresight 
and our intelligent conceptions of government. In a similar 
way the French have opened schools in Morocco and Algiers, 
and the English in Egypt and India. With the freeing of 
Palestine from the rule of the Turk, the English at once 
began the establishment of schools and a national university 
there. In all lands where there is to-day an intelligent pop- 
ular government, general education is regarded as an instru- 
ment of the first importance in moulding and shaping the 
destinies of the people. 
In our own land, despite all our admirable progress, we 
still have a large task before us, and the task increases with 
the passing of years. We have here the makings of a great 
Nation, but the task before us is to makeit. The raw ma- 
terials — Saxon and Celt, Teuton and Slav, Latin and Hun 
—all are here. Our problem is to assimilate and amalga- 
mate them all into a unified Nation, actuated by common 
impulses, inspired by common ideals, conscious of a moral 
unity and purpose which will be our strength, and so filled 
with reverence for our type of national life that our youth 
will feel that our form of government is worth dying for to 
defend. Never did opportunity knock more loudly at the 
doors of a Nation than it has at ours since 1914, and never 
was a Nation in better position to, open its doors in response 
to the knocking. The place we shall occupy in history will 
be determined largely by how well we meet the emergencies 
of the present situation; how satisfactorily we solve’ the 
many new problems of the new world life after the World 
War; how well we respond to the calls of humanity for serv- 
ice; and to what extent we utilize the opportunity now pre- 
sented to reorganize and unify our national life within. 
 
-P-A-G-E-546
    
  504 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Many forces must codperate in the work, but unless our 
schools become clearly conscious of the national needs and 
the national purposes, and utilize the opportunities now 
presented for new and larger national service, we shall, in 
part at least, fail to reach the world position we might other- 
wise have occupied. 
Importance of the educational service. Education in a 
democratic government such as ours is the greatest of all 
undertakings for the promotion of the national welfare, and 
the teacher in our schools renders an inconspicuous but a 
highly important national service. In teaching to the young 
the principles which lie at the basis of our democratic life; in 
awakening in them the conception of liberty guided by law, 
and the difference between freedom and license; in training 
them for self-control; in developing in them the ability to 
shoulder responsibility; in awakening them to the greatness 
of that democratic nobility in which all can share; in instill- 
ing into them the importance of fidelity to duty, truth, 
honor, and virtue; and in unifying diverse elements and fus- 
ing them into the national mould; the schools are rendering 
a national service seldom appreciated and not likely to be 
Overestimated. It was to create such constructive institu- 
tions for our democratic life that we took the school over 
from the Church, severed all connections between it and its 
parent; made it free and equally open to all, and dignified its 
instruction as a birthright of every American boy and girl.

  QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. Does the obligation to educate impose any greater exercise of state 
authority than the obligation to protect the public health? 
2. What would be the result were we to relieve from school taxation 
those who send their children to private or parochial schools? 
8. While schools have, at first, been established by majority action, 
is it not true that much further development has been made by a small 
but thinking minority? Illustrate. 
4. Show that art and musical education would be a legitimate extension| 
of public educational effort.

5. Does the provision of equal opportunity for all necessitate equal or 
equivalent schools or school rights? Illustrate. 
6. Show why the essentially democratic American school system would 
not be suited to an autocratic type of government. 
7. Show that compulsory school attendance is the natural corollary of 
taxation for schools. 
8. What is meant by the State increasing standards which may involve 
reciprocal obligations on the part of the State? 
9. Show that the demands of the State on private and parochial schools, 
mentioned on page 494, are legitimate demands. 
10. Illustrate the difference between an acceptance in principle and an q 
acceptance in reality. 
11. Are the characteristics which we have developed in our young people 
those of a new or an old country? Why so?

welfare. 
13. What kind of discipline is represented by the Army? By the Boy 
Scouts? Are schools of both types? Illustrate. 
14. Show that the weight of a priesthood and the force of religious instruc- 
tion in the schools would be strong supports for an autocratic state. 
15. We do much less in the training of teachers than do homogeneous 
monarchical nations having an army and a priesthood. _Is this right? 
How do you explain this condition? 
16. Have we done much so far in giving our students world vision? Why? 
Do we need to do so? 
17. What are likely to be the effects at home of the standards of national 
honor we have developed abroad? Illustrate. 
18. Show how our educational tasks increase with the years. 
19. Show how the World War is likely to be of great advantage to us in 
the matter of assimilating and integrating our foreign-born.

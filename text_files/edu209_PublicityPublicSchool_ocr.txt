  INTRODUCTION 
Tue American public school is a marvelous ex- 
pression of popular faith. It is founded on the 
deep and wide, practically universal, belief of the 
people in the general efficacy of education. On 
this foundation there has been reared a structure 
that already surpasses in magnitude and com- 
plexity the visions even of the most far-seeing 
protagonists of popular education of only a 
generation or two ago. And the end of building 
the public school is not yet. On the contrary, we 
must regard the school of the present, in its best 
expression, rather as a promise of the school of the 
future that will more fully justify the popular 
faith on which it is founded. 
How long will this foundation of popular faith 
continue to sustain the ever-expanding load that 
is being put upon it? Is there no near limit to its 
sustaining power? These are grave questions to 
which those in immediate charge of public school 
development are finding themselves compelled 
to give increasing study. The most competent 
answer appears to be that the faith foundations of 
v

INTRODUCTION 
our public schools are of the very soundest and 
most reliable; that they can be depended upon to 
develop sustaining power commensurate with any 
structure that need ever be erected upon them, 
provided only that this structure be buttressed 
with adequate popular understanding. Not 
deeper popular faith, but clearer and fuller pop- 
ular understanding, is the present great desider- 
atum of our public schools. 
The development of public schools in our cities, 
especially in the last generation, has far outrun 
the development of widespread popular under- 
standing of them. Those in charge have been 
generally too fully absorbed in the immediate 
problems of the schools themselves to give ade- 
quate attention to the information of the public 
concerning the institution that the public is 
supporting. Too often, indeed, teachers and 
school officials, through temperament or miscon- 
ception or both, have been quite indifferent, even 
strongly opposed, to revealing to the public that 
knowledge essential to any real understanding. 
This is not the infamous ‘‘public-be-damned” 
policy, but rather the public-be-shunned policy. 
The inevitable result of this policy or attitude on 
the part of teachers and school officials — the 
very people and the only people fully competent

INTRODUCTION 
to give to the public needed information — has 
been much lack of understanding and not a little 
gross misunderstanding by the people of the pub- 
lic school of to-day. The public press, the chief 
avenue of general publicity, has found it easy 
to present educational innovations in a sensa- 
tional and unfavorable light to a public whose 
standards of interpretation have been mainly 
derived from childhood experiences, frequently 
under the most primitive rural school conditions. 
In taking advantage of this easy opportunity the 
press gives no sure evidence of sensationalism or 
of insincerity; the press itself is not seldom in need 
of better understanding as well as the public. 
In very recent years, notably in the last decade, 
the possibilities and the importance of publicity 
have been dawning upon school people, chiefly 
school superintendents who are assuming the réle 
of aggressive educational leadership. The most 
striking and widespread evidences of this new 
attitude toward publicity are to be seen in the 
campaigns of education, usually for the purpose 
of securing increased financial support. These 
campaigns or “‘drives” have already become so 
frequent and general that they may be accepted 
as the current approved method of ‘putting 
over” a bond issue or an increase in the tax levy.

INTRODUCTION 
| So far these campaigns have been quite 
generally successful, that is, they have attained 
their object — increased financial support. The 
success, however, of this type of publicity had 
best be taken as evidence of the eagerness, not to 
say the credulity, with which the people accept 
information on the subject of public education; it 
can scarcely be taken as a demonstration of the 
fitness of the campaign method itself to serve as 
a permanent or a chief means of giving the public 
adequate information concerning the schools. 
Campaign publicity is too evidently propaganda; 
it deals with such information and only such in- 
formation as the promoters think suitable to the 
achievement of the desired goal. 
What the schools need and what the public will 
increasingly demand is continuous and reliable 
publicity, the primary motive of which is not 
definite and immediate, even spasmodic, action 
on the part of the public, but rather a sound 
and adequate comprehension by the people of 
the institution that they have created and are 
supporting. Only such comprehension can be re- 
lied upon permanently to shape the development 
and to furnish the support that public education 
must have to render its greatest service. There 
are multiplying evidences that this fact is begin-

INTRODUCTION 
ning to be appreciated by progressive school 
officials. 
For such, the problem is how to proceed in this 
new field. What shall be the program? It is quite 
natural.:to turn, for standards and methods of 
procedure, to private business which has had long 
experience in publicity work. The methods 
and standards of private business, however, can 
safely be taken only as suggestive. To adopt 
them outright would be a grave mistake. The 
very fact that the public school is a creation of 
the people, belongs to the people, is supported by 
the people, not for profit but for service, places 
this enterprise in its relation to the public in a 
position quite different from that of any private 
business enterprise; hence the publicity program 
of the school must be adapted to these conditions. 
The practical possibilities of such a program; 
the various media and avenues of publicity, es- 
pecially the public press; sound principles and 
methods of procedure; questionable practices and 
pitfalls to be avoided — these are the large themes 
which this monograph, the first treatise of the 
kind, discusses in a practical manner that must be 
of great service to all interested or engaged in 
public educational publicity. 
The authors of this volume are probably better

qualified to prepare this initial work on the subject 
than is any one else in the country. They have 
had several years’ eminently successful experi- 
ence in dealing with all the matters that they 
| discuss. One of them, Mr. Miller, is Director of 
, Publications in the Cleveland school system and 
in that capacity has extended wide codperation 
to the public press; the other, Mr. Charles, a 
member of the editorial staff of a Cleveland news- 
paper, has had long experience ‘in writing and 
editing educational news. These two men have 
given in Cleveland a notable demonstration of 
the possibilities, practical methods, and sound 
principles of continuous educational publicity.

THE AVENUES TO PUBLIC 
UNDERSTANDING

EDUCATIONAL progress in America rests almost 
entirely upon the understanding which the Amer- 
ican public has of its school system. The demo- 
cratic nature of our institutions makes this truth 
axiomatic and places upon those in charge of 
our public schools responsibilities that are far- 
reaching. 
CEducators of the Nation must do their full 
share to bring about on the part of the public an 
accurate understanding of the ideals, accomplish- 
ments, and needs of the public schools, This can 
be obtained on a national scale only when it is 
obtained in the tens of thousands of communi- 
ties which make up the Nation. Without such 
understanding there cannot be that community 
support which is essential to the realization of I ;
-P-A-G-E-12
PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
the splendid possibilities of the public schools. 
With it, there will be generous measure of sup- 
port expressed in terms of parental codperation, 
in willingness on the part of the public to ap- 
prove progressive educational programs and to 
sanction necessary bond issues and tax levies, 
and in favorable school legislation. 
Not only every school administrator, but every 
teacher, should recognize the significance of these 
facts. Even in times of “normalcy” — if ever 
there have been such times — it is essential to 
public school progress that the people have ade- 
quate understanding of, and give adequate sup- 
port to, the schools. In the restless, uncertain 
times following the World War such understand- 
ing and support are especially needed. 
The America of to-day is a nation in the begin- 
ning of a new epoch. Its largest possibilities, 
economic, cultural, and spiritual, are almost en- 
tirely dependent upon the quality and quantity 
of public education. Educational progress pre- 
cedes and accompanies national progress. 
Many thoughtful persons are anxious about 
the future. They see evidences of gross materi- 
alism, selfishness, ignorance, prejudice, and in- 
tolerance on every side and believe that the 
country is imperiled. With the spiritual influ- 
2 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
  
  AVENUES TO PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING 
ence of the Church admittedly diminishing, the 
schools must take upon themselves, whether they 
will or no, much of the work that formerly was 
performed by it. They must continue to teach 
all that they have taught in the past, and in ad- 
dition they must dispel the threatening evils of 
the day. 
So the school, with its larger task, needs pop- 
ular support more than ever before. It needs 
money and it needs appreciation. And all of 
those things which it needs can be obtained only 
through the education of the adult public. 
This, if anything, justifies the use of school 
publicity. But publicity, when it is employed in 
accordance with these concepts, must aim at the 
improvement of education, not at the glorifica- 
tion of any person or any set of persons. It must 
be honest and natural. It must be as the light 
from which the bushel has been lifted. 
America, as a result of the enormous influx of 
foreign-born in recent decades, is confronted with 
educational difficulties that are far from being 
satisfactorily handled. The public should know 
about them and should have made clear to it the 
remedy. 
The vast tide of immigration has thrown upon 
educators problems and situations that are trying 
3
-P-A-G-E-14
    PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
and perplexing. Night schools, factory classes, 
and well-intentioned Americanization undertak- 
ings by private groups have been set up to 
meet this situation. But the heaviest part of the 
task of making Americans out of the foreign- 
born and the children of the foreign-born rests 
upon the schools of the Nation. It is one of the 
most difficult tasks in all history. Its perform- 
ance necessarily involves the codperation of all 
of America with the schools. This responsibility 
brings about a need for flexibility, for vastly in- 
creased services of social, medical, and recrea- 
tional nature, which, if they are to be offered 
without lessening the purely educational purpose 
of the schools, must receive financial support 
that can come only through public understand- 
ing. 
It is not amiss to point out that the new re- 
sponsibilities make it impossible to fulfill the 
school’s primary educational purpose as econom- 
ically and effectively as it was performed a few 
decades ago. Added to this handicap is that of 
the greatly increased cost of commodities and 
labor and of professional service. These have 
risen faster than taxes have increased. Public 
school systems, depending upon public taxation 
for support, and confronted with increasing de- 
4
-P-A-G-E-15
  
AVENUES TO PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING 
mands for additional service, more than ever be- 
fore owe it to the children and to the Nation to 
take the people into full confidence in the matter 
of these serious problems. 
America cannot realize its highest destiny if the 
quality of public education is permitted to dete- 
riorate. The fact that the scope of the schools 
is wider to-day than ever before is by no means 
assurance that the quality of service rendered 
to the individual child, the “thoroughness” of 
teaching, and the development of character are 
better. 
Thoughtful men and women recognize that, 
notwithstanding the improvements in educa- 
tional technique and the advances in educational 
philosophy of recent years, America has not mas- 
tered its perplexing problems of public educa- 
tion. The people should know that, despite these 
marked advances, America itself has been chang- 
ing too rapidly to permit the schools to “catch 
up.” ; 
While educational methods and philosophy 
are better than ever before, the education re- 
ceived by the individual child is likely to be 
“thinned out.” At any rate, many business 
men, manufacturers, and other large employers 
of labor believe this. And many parents believe 
5
-P-A-G-E-16
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
that their children are not receiving education 
as “thorough” as they themselves received. A 
restive public mutters about “‘frills and fads.” 
What is the duty of the school administrator in 
this time of crisis? He must let the people know 
the trying problems with which the school sys- 
tem has to cope. He must do his best to see 
that the people know what those in charge of the 
schools are trying to do in order to make them as 
effective as possible with the funds at their dis- 
posal. He must admit all inefficiencies and evils, 
frankly and fully, and must patiently and fre- 
quently point to the underlying causes. 
Once the public sees the problems and needs 
of the schools the support will be assured, for 
America does believe in education. 
Il 
Every educator should be familiar with the im- 
“portant avenues which, if intelligently utilized, 
can bring the public into much closer contact 
with its system of popular education. Knowing 
these avenues, the educator himself can do much 
that will make for the progress he seeks. The 
educator’s problem in this is similar to that of 
the business man who must market a product. 
It is a problem in publicity. But public school 
6
-P-A-G-E-17
  AVENUES TO PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING 
publicity, to result in permanent good, must fol- 
low lines very different from those followed by 
private businesses. 
The public school system as a tax-supported 
institution in a democracy cannot set up and ex- 
pend an advertising budget to present the ad- 
vantages and claims of the education it offers. 
Legal and moral justification of such expendi- 
ture could be seriously questioned. Such a 
process would necessarily involve a selection of 
the facts to be presented in the advertisements, 
and selection of facts by those in charge of the 
schools is closely related to a censorship funda- 
mentally un-American. 
The public, willing enough to have presented. 
to it the advertising of private business concerns, 
is of a different temper when it comes to accept- 
ing the advertising, paid for out of public money, 
of selected facts which the administrators of 
public business choose to set before it. Those 
comprising the public prefer that their informa- 
tion of public institutions be gained through 
their own efforts or through the knowledge of in- 
formed sources in which they have confidence. 
The use of the word “publicity” in connection 
with the problem of disseminating information 
about the schools must be guarded because of 
7  
-P-A-G-E-18
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
the suggestion, in the popular use of the word, 
of press-agentry and boasting. Unfortunately, 
there is no word which can conveniently take the 
place of “publicity”; hence pains must be taken 
by school administrators to see that the public 
understands that it does not carry any sugges- 
tion of press-agentry, of covering up facts un- 
favorable to the school administration while put- 
ting the best foot forward. 
The public schools cannot make successful use 
of paid advertising and other forms of paid-for 
direct publicity. The educational administrator 
must depend on avenues of publicity the legit- 
imacy of which, when used by tax-supported in- 
stitutions, cannot be questioned. 
Whatever the public learns of its school sys- 
tem must come largely through processes of in- 
direction which, none the less, can be exceedingly 
effective. In the first place, there is the school 
system itself, and the vast work it is doing, affect- 
ing directly most of the homes in the community. 
What the pupils tell their parents of their school 
work, what the teachers tell their friends .con- 
cerning the many activities of the school sys- 
tem, what those interested in the schools dis- 
cover’ through personal visitation, the very ap- 
pearance of school buildings and grounds — all 
8 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  
AVENUES TO PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING 
of this is public information of fundamental im- 
portance. 
This is, to a great extent, word-of-mouth pub- 
licity and it is based upon actual performance 
of the schools. It is not unlike that word-of- 
mouth publicity which can stimulate or hinder 
the sale of commercial products — motor cars or 
washing powders. It is that intangible thing 
known as “reputation.” 
A school system that is serving its community 
well cannot but have the benefit of this highly 
potential word-of-mouth publicity. But how- 
ever well the system may be serving its commu- 
nity, there can be conscious thought on the part 
of the administrators regarding publicity factors, 
and conscious effort to see that they function 
honestly and effectively. 
What are the avenues to public support and 
confidence? Briefly enumerated, they are: 
1. The school system itself. 
2. The newspapers. 
3. Student publications, reflecting the work 
of their own schools. 
4. A department of school information. 
5. The school “house organ.” 
6. Miscellaneous points of contact with the 
public, such as parent-teacher clubs, civic 
9 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
societies, community centers, school re- 
ports, bulletins, monographs, etc. 
Til 
A pustic school system has within itself those 
qualities which are essential, not only to the dis- 
semination, but also to the creation, of publicity. 
As an organization which, through the pupils 
and teachers, can touch nearly every home in the 
community within twenty-four hours, it is al- 
most without equal as a means of disseminating 
facts. 
All that the public reads or hears or sees about 
the community’s system of public education is 
based, directly or indirectly, on that system. If 
the schools are doing good work, what the public 
reads or hears or sees will, in the main, reflect 
this good work. If the work is definitely and un- 
doubtedly poor, this poor work will be mirrored 
sooner or later. 
Every pupil carries home to his parents certain 
definite impressions of the schools: the type of 
teacher employed, the fairness or unfairness of 
teacher and principal, the standard of conduct 
permitted in the schoolroom, the soundness or 
futility of the courses studied. 
Many parents are quick to learn whether or 
Io 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  AVENUES TO PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING 
not teachers are doing their very best for the 
children in their charge. And the parents of 
high intelligence — those who make public opin- 
ion — frequently discover why teachers are fail- 
ing to do their best, when they are failing. No 
mere words of the superintendent or other exec- 
utives can wipe out the impressions obtained 
first-hand from the school system itself through 
teachers and children. 
Business concerns intelligently hoping for per- 
manent existence must let their products be the 
basis of their advertising. Such concerns recog- 
nize that their product is their best advertising. 
This holds also for the public schools. The 
work of the schools is their best advertising. On 
it is based the word-of-mouth publicity which is 
most effective, for good or for evil. 
In so far as this work is honest effort to bring 
the best possible results in education with the 
means available, the advertising will be favorable 
and beneficial. The mass of the people will form 
an approximately correct idea of the work of the 
schools, and this idea must be the basis of all 
other forms of publicity. Upon it must be pred- 
icated the explanations of educational policy 
and method. 
An efficient school administration, notwith- 
II
-P-A-G-E-22
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
standing misunderstandings and prejudices, will 
not and cannot keep its light under a bushel. 
And just in so far as it is efficient and honest will 
there be confidence in its public pronouncements. 
Its own honest admissions of imperfection, in- 
stead of resulting in public condemnation, simply 
will pave the way for the general acceptance of 
the administration’s program for correcting the 
evils. 
Every teacher “talks school” often or occa- 
sionally with members of her family and her 
friends. If she impresses others as being intelli- 
. gent, professionally minded, honest, and hard- 
working, they receive at once a favorable im- 
pression of the entire system. If she is lacking in 
one or more of these essential qualities, it is not 
unnaturally inferred that the whole of which she 
is a part may also be lacking in some or all of 
these qualities. 
If teachers are dissatisfied, if they have just 
complaints against the inefficiency, the harsh- 
ness, the extravagance, or the unfitness of their 
superiors, the public very soon will sense the fact 
that the administration is unworthy of support. 
Teachers have friends, and some of these friends 
include the most prominent and influential men 
and women of the community, the men and 
12
-P-A-G-E-23
AVENUES TO PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING 
women who take the leadership in forming public 
opinion. When a school administration is hon- 
estly and intelligently carried on, with every ef- 
fort made to provide the best buildings, equip- 
ment, and personnel which the money available 
will buy, favorable publicity will follow automat- 
ically and will travel throughout the entire 
community through pupils, parents, teachers, 
and friends of teachers. 
To a less extent, only because they are fewer 
in number, other employees of the schools — 
carpenters, custodians, and business department 
workers — also carry forth and disseminate opin- 
ions which reflect creditably or otherwise on the 
school management. 
The first essential, then, in any attempt to use 
any one or all of the many avenues of publicity, 
is a proper comprehension by the school admin- 
istrator of the work in which he is engaged, of the 
aims he is attempting to achieve, and of the 
factors employed in achieving those aims. Ina 
word, he must understand that his work is a pub- 
lic service and must comprehend his proper re- 
lationship with the public. He must encourage 
every teacher to be a missionary of educational 
progress in the community. 
Once the teaching corps of a school system has 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
caught the vision of what can be accomplished 
through enlightened missionary effort — through 
“talking school” constructively with relations 
and friends and through closer personal contact 
with parents of pupils — the efficiency of that 
system will inevitably increase as a result of the 
larger understanding on the part of the citizens. 
IV 
BETTER utilization of all the avenues to public 
opinion which have been mentioned earlier in this 
chapter will come when educators make proper 
application of certain cardinal principles of the 
theory and practice of publicity — principles 
which this book attempts to define and illustrate. 
Some of the avenues mentioned are more im- 
portant than others; some lead into others, or 
cross them or parallel them. All are branches of 
the main avenue, the school system itself. Next 
to the school system in importance as an avenue 
to public opinion is the newspaper. 
Of all the people among whom school admin- 
istrators, teachers, and pupils spread word-of- 
mouth publicity, none are more influential in cre- 
ating public opinion than the newspaper writers, 
for the reason that these, through their papers, 
have direct and immediate access to virtually the 
14 
   
-P-A-G-E-25
AVENUES TO PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING 
entire public. They'can take the words of one 
school official or of one teacher and by printing 
them can bring them before the entire com- 
munity. Thus oral publicity of limited scope 
can be translated within the period of a few 
hours or less into written publicity almost un- 
limited in its scope. Moreover, the printed 
word carries an authority that frequently is 
denied to the spoken word. 
(é To reiterate, the newspaper, aside from the 
school system itself, is the most important 
{ avenue through which the public can be informed 
about its schools. But the newspaper is like 
dynamite — it can be constructive or terribly 
destructive. Thoroughgoing knowledge of dy- 
namite and its powers is essential to any one who 
must handle it. Educators as public servants 
must codperate with the daily press. They 
cannot have too much knowledge of what con- 
stitutes news, of newspaper methods, technique, 
and needs. Their lack of knowledge_of the 
nature and ways of the public press, probably 
more than any other factor, explains lack of 
public understanding and support of the schools. 
In the effort to bring about a greater measure 
of sympathetic codperation between the schools 
and the public, it is desirable that newspaper 
15  
-P-A-G-E-26
ee ene ae 
PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
workers should have larger understanding of the 
schools; but it is essential that educators have 
larger understanding of newspapers, their prob- 
lems, their desires, their psychology, their pow- | 
ers, their limitations, their methods, their tech- 
nique. 
The American newspaper, notwithstanding 
shortcomings which sometimes are only too ob- 
vious, is the world’s greatest disseminator of in- 
‘ formation. Its potentialities and possibilities 
as a medium for disseminating information about 
the public schools have been made evident in 
hundreds of communities in America. These 
possibilities will be realized in greater and greater 
measure as educators become familiar with news- 
paper methods and give more of their time and 
thought to codperation with the daily press. 
Therefore, as part of a presentation of outstand- 
ing phases of the subject of public school public- 
ity, this book contains certain chapters written 
for the purpose of bringing to educational ad- 
ministrators a larger knowledge of the American 
newspaper and its methods.     Vv 
In considering the newspaper and the other 
avenues to public opinion, the reader should bear 
: 16
-P-A-G-E-27
  AVENUES TO PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING 
in mind that public school publicity has its own 
code of ethics and practices. The fact that the 
schools are tax-supported makes this so and 
eliminates from their publicity many aims and 
methods that are legitimate in other fields. 
This elimination works no hardship on the 
schools. A public school system, simply because 
it is public, has publicity advantages which are 
denied to private business. That most school 
systems are not effectively utilizing these cannot 
be accepted as evidence that they do not exist. 
Their publicity problems are much simpler than 
those of private business. 
Private business concerns which advertise can 
do so only at considerable expense. They must 
pay large sums to get information about their 
products or service into the advertising columns 
of the newspapers. Ordinarily, the news and 
editorial columns are closed to presentation of 
the facts they would give to the public. But the 
news and editorial columns of the newspapers 
are open to interesting facts about the public 
schools. Space in these columns, moreover, has 
larger publicity value by far than the paid-for 
display advertisements; yet it costs the public 
schools nothing. 
Private business concerns make use of costly 
17
-P-A-G-E-28
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
billboard advertising. An attractive public 
school building is a better advertisement of edu- 
cational progress than any billboard that could 
be designed. Yet this advertising value in- 
volves no additional cost. 
Private business concerns must pay salesmen 
large sums to create public confidence in their 
products or service. Conscientious, enthusiastic 
teachers, believing that the school system of 
which they are part is honestly attempting to do 
its best and to raise its standards of achievement, 
comprise an avenue to public confidence that 
private business cannot duplicate. Similarly, 
every contact which the schools have with the 
public, whether through the classroom instruc- 
tion of the children or through such extra-curric- 
ular activities as medical service, recreation, or 
community centers, is an avenue to the public, 
its understanding, and its confidence. 
VI 
UrtiLizaTIon of the school system’s publicity op- 
portunities involves insignificant financial cost, if 
any at all. Whatever cost may be incurred may 
be justly charged to administrative service. By 
this is meant those forms of service which will 
tend to improve the work and morale of the sys+

tem, which will bring to every teacher a larger 
vision of the great educational undertaking of 
which her own activities are part, which will 
make it easier for the people and the newspapers 
of the community to obtain honest, accurate 
information of the aims, accomplishments, and 
needs of their schools. 
The school house organ, published for and by 
the teaching corps of the system, is technically a 
form of internal publicity; actually it is a form of 
educational administration, of supervision in the 
larger meaning of the term — for its purpose is to 
give to all teachers such professional information 
as will tend to improve their teaching and pro- 
mote harmonious codperation, and to print such 
salient facts about the system as will set forth 
its best aims and ideals. The teachers’ house 
organ, discussed in the next chapter, will not 
gloss over the system’s shortcomings; it will 
print anything calculated to inspire its readers to 
work for a better school system. Administra- 
tive service through the medium of the printed 
word can be sufficiently effective, not only to pay 
for itself, but to result in actual financial saving 
by reducing the need for personal supervision. 
The educational administrator who clearly sees 
the avenues to public understanding and support

that are open to the school system and who, with 
sound knowledge of their large possibilities, 
makes the proper adaptations in his administra- 
tive program, will soon discover that the schools 
are obtaining not only a larger measure of public 
confidence, but that they are also steadily im- 
proving their acomplishments and constantly 
striving toward higher ideals of service to the 
children and the community.

PUBLICITY WITHIN THE SCHOOL 
SYSTEM 
I 
Every school administrator must make constant 
use of publicity within the school system itself; 
and every administrator is doing it, consciously 
or unconsciously, with varying degrees of suc- 
cess. 
When the educational executive addresses a 
teachers’ meeting, he is using one of the most 
effective of publicity media, the spoken word. 
He makes constant use of this to outline to his 
associates and to the teaching body those poli- 
cies which they must thoroughly understand and 
believe in to insure harmonious, whole-hearted 
effort toward the accomplishment of definite 
ends. He uses the spoken word to describe new 
and improved methods of supervision and in- 
struction, to explain changes in curriculum, to 
suggest better forms of routine procedure, to 
promote professional growth, to create a higher 
morale throughout the schools. 
21 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
Those qualities without which no advertise- 
ment can have a maximum of success are as nec- 
essary when the spoken word is used as when 
the medium is printers’ ink. Publicity, whether 
spoken or printed, must be pleasingly attractive, 
interesting and helpful. 
I 
Tue school administrator must cultivate a 
pleasing personality. He must radiate unself- 
ishness, frankness, good-cheer. He must “hu- 
manize” his school system. It goes without say- 
ing that his words and acts must reflect his 
intelligence. But intellect without heart can ac- 
complish but little in educational administration 
as in teaching. Just as the teacher must have 
the qualities of kindness, sympathy, and under- 
standing to do worth-while teaching, so the ad- 
ministrator must have them to obtain the loyal 
coéperation of his assistants and teachers. His 
instructions, his advice and counsel to others — 
his publicity of the spoken word, in short — 
will be without the desired effect if the quality of 
attractiveness is lacking, and lacking it will be if 
the administrator’s personality is not pleasing. 
The successful administrator will take great 
pains to make every staff meeting and every 
: 22 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
PUBLICITY WITHIN SCHOOL SYSTEM 
teachers’ meeting interesting and helpful. The , 
school administrator who forces his teachers to 
suffer martyrdom in long-drawn-out, dry-as-dust 
meetings is violating not only the principles of 
effective publicity, but also those of sound ped- 
agogy. Good teaching and effective publicity 
are alike in that each must produce ‘interest and 
result in initiative. 
Where publicity of the spoken word is properly 
founded and utilized, the teachers are disposed to 
be interested and spontaneous, eager to do their 
best; the principals and supervisors are regarded, ~ 
not as necessary evils, but as important helpers 
in a common task; the superintendent commands 
the respect and loyalty of the schools and the 
community. 
All of this is so simple that it may seem out of 
place in a volume devoted to public school pub- 
licity, yet it is of elemental importance. Many 
who talk and write about “publicity” and its 
professional application are prone to clothe the 
subject with mystery and complex technique. 
It is true that satisfactory utilization of the 
printed word does require considerable knowl- 
edge of technical methods, but the printed word 
comprises but one of many media. The spoken 
word, by the very nature of the administrator’s 
23
-P-A-G-E-34
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
task, is his basic publicity medium. He cannot 
afford to slight the factors which make it effec- 
tive. 
Educational welfare of uncounted numbers 
of children has suffered because administrators 
have not cultivated within themselves the frank, 
cheerful, attractive personality. The impera- 
tive need for such personality should be in the 
mind of every superintendent, every supervisor, 
every principal, every teacher. The solemn, 
owl-like demeanor, the dull, portentous discourse, 
the Prussian system of rigorous authority which 
characterize some so-called educators have 
wrought great harm to American children. Ina 
good school the children are busy, interested, and 
happy. They cannot be so unless the teachers 
and executives are busy, interested, and happy, 
spontaneous, cheerful, and frank. The super- 
intendent must remember always that a good 
school is its own best publicity. 
It 
In the larger school systems, employing hundreds 
or thousands of teachers, the superintendent is 
farther removed from the teaching body. He 
cannot know his teachers personally. The im- 
portant influence of his own personality among 
24
-P-A-G-E-35
  
PUBLICITY WITHIN SCHOOL SYSTEM ' 
the teaching body grows less and less as the sys- 
tem grows in size. But the teacher, as the base 
of the educational pyramid, needs the inspiring 
influence of a good executive. With the big-city 
superintendent kept constantly busy with ad- 
ministrative problems, the large system is in 
danger of becoming machine-like, cold and re- 
lentless and correspondingly inefficient. 
More attention, consequently, must be paid 
to teachers’ morale in the large system than in 
that of the small community. 
Inasmuch as it is impossible or impracticable 
for a big-city superintendent to meet frequently 
with his teaching corps, his influence must go to 
the teachers through his subordinates. His pol- 
icies, his ideals, and even his personality must be 
carried to the teaching corps by the members of 
his official staff which may be understood to in- 
clude assistant superintendents, supervisors, and 
directors of departments. He should meet with 
his staff frequently — once a week is not too 
often. Although he is associated with individual 
members of this group every day, such associa- 
tion involves, for the most part, the considera- 
tion of specific administrative details. To give 
to all of his staff members a bird’s-eye view of the 
outstanding major problems of the administra- 
25
-P-A-G-E-36
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
tion so that all may codperate in a satisfactory 
solution of them, to bring to the group as a whole 
the contribution which every individual member 
can make, to promote within the group a zeal for 
professional growth, to emphasize the importance 
of heart as well as that of head, the superintend- 
ent will put into these weekly staff meetings the 
very best elements of his own personality and 
intellect. He will make his best use of the 
spoken word. What he says, if he says it effec- 
tively enough, will be reflected in the better, 
happier teaching of the humblest teacher in the 
most outlying school. His meetings with school 
principals, held less frequently than staff meet- 
ings, will be similarly characterized. 
In this connection it should be said that the 
meetings of too many superintendents are stiff, 
formal conferences the only result of which can be 
the adding of more mechanization to an already 
mechanical system. Such administrators would 
do well, indeed, to apply themselves with con- 
triteness and humility to consideration of those 
elemental qualities of personality which enter so 
largely into the success of the basic publicity 
medium of the spoken word. These, indeed, are 
the elements of influence and leadership. They 
include the ability to humanize the most ab- 
26
-P-A-G-E-37
PUBLICITY WITHIN SCHOOL SYSTEM 
struse of pedagogical theories, to make the im- 
portant things interesting and alluring. Striking 
evidence of the effectiveness of these elements is 
seen in the lives of all great leaders. In none have 
they been more prominent than in Abraham 
Lincoln, the sunshine of whose personality per- 
vaded the most momentous cabinet meetings. 
The superintendent who is without humor and 
sympathy, or who believes that the dignity of his 
position makes such qualities out of place in con- 
tact with his fellows, is more likely to be a blight 
than a benefit. 
The atmosphere, the spirit, the zeal for pro- 
fessional growth, the morale and all the quali- 
ties which characterize the superintendent’s staff 
meetings will be carried over into those princi- 
pals’ or teachers’ gatherings which are addressed 
by assistant superintendents, supervisors, and 
directors. Thus they will permeate the entire 
system. Confidence in the leadership of the 
superintendent, belief in his aims and policies, 
and harmonious codperation throughout the sys- 
tem to achieve such aims will be promoted in this 
manner. 
The superintendent who enjoys the confidence 
of his teaching body possesses one of the surest 
guarantees of successful administration and pub- 
27 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
licsupport. The publicity value of such con- 
fidence is large. When the superintendent is 
quoted on significant matters by the daily press, 
his statements take on a vast amount of addi- 
tional force because they are believed by hun- 
dreds or thousands of teachers who, in their con- 
versation with members of their families or with 
citizens, uphold the published policy of the ad- 
ministration. In such situations —and they 
occur with great frequency in every community 
— the superintendent’s effective use within the 
system of publicity of the spoken word exerts 
influence, not only throughout the system, but 
throughout the community. 
IV 
To supplement the spoken word, the superin- 
tendent can make valuable use of the written 
word. ‘This brings us to consideration of the 
magazine, published under the direction of the 
superintendent. 
The magazine of a school system bears to that 
system the same relationship which the house 
organ bears to a private business. It is in reality 
a house organ for teachers. 
Railroads, banks, telephone companies, and 
other public service corporations, department 
28  
-P-A-G-E-39
PUBLICITY WITHIN SCHOOL SYSTEM 
stores and large merchandising and manufactur- 
ing institutions have advanced the house organ 
far past the experimental stage. Scores and 
hundreds of America’s large business concerns re- 
gard it as a means of securing within the organ- 
ization the understanding of methods of tech- 
nique in manufacture, merchandising, selling, or 
service, the harmonious codperation among de- 
partments and individuals, and the loyalty and 
morale which are essential to successful business 
enterprise. 
The larger the business concern, the more di- 
versified its departmental organization, and the 
more scattered its personnel, the greater is the 
need for the unifying house organ. 
In a small business the proprietor or executive 
can be in personal contact with all of the em- 
ployees and by the spoken word can create the 
desired morale and effort. Not so in the big busi- 
ness institution where it is humanly impossible 
for the chief executive to know more than a 
small minority of the employees. He finds him- 
self compelled to make use of the written word. 
Education has lagged far behind business in 
the utilization of the house organ for increasing 
the effectiveness of organization and perform- 
ance. The house organ can accomplish as much 
29  
-P-A-G-E-40
ee ee rn eT 
PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
for a school system as it can for a railroad, a 
banking corporation, or a department store. In 
truth, it can accomplish more, for teachers, as a 
class, are more responsive to the appeal of ideal- 
ism than most groups of workers in private 
business. Teachers know that their best work 
is measured in increased child welfare. If their 
salaries are reduced, they do not vent their spite 
on the children. The interest of a conscientious 
teacher in her pupils is constant. 
The situation is quite different in private busi- 
ness where the employees know, instinctively, 
that their best work, while benefiting them- 
selves, also makes their employers richer. Self- 
ishness and envy —no matter how unjustified 
they may be — play a larger part by far in a 
commercial institution than in a school system. 
If private business, in which the handicaps are 
far greater, can obtain highly desired results 
from the house organ, how much better can be 
the results from its use in a school system! 
‘ Vv 
PuBLicaTIon of a successful house organ for 
teachers involves a special knowledge, not only of 
education, but also of the technique of writing 
and editing and of typography. To be success- 
30
-P-A-G-E-41
PUBLICITY WITHIN SCHOOL SYSTEM 
ful, it must be attractive in appearance, so at- 
tractive that those into whose hands it is placed 
are fairly lured into the perusal of its columns. 
Its contents must be interesting, and must be of 
real help in adding to the knowledge and under- 
standing of the readers and in inspiring them to 
more purposeful and better teaching. 
The editor of such a publication must have 
sufficient knowledge of type and its use to insure 
attractiveness of appearance. Every issue of 
the publication must be made inviting by artistic 
arrangement of articles and illustrations. The 
editor must have thorough knowledge of the 
principles of education in general and of the 
work and policies of the school system in partic- 
ular to insure preparation or selection of articles 
which will be interesting and helpful to the 
teachers. He should have sufficient experience 
in writing and editing to command the essentials 
of that knowledge or intuition by which he is able 
to give the emphasis in form, content, and space 
to articles to insure sustained interest on the part 
of the readers. 
A publication unattractive in appearance and 
dull in content is likely to fail in its purpose. It 
will be read only by the minority group comprised 
of teachers extraordinarily conscientious and ex- 
31

ceedingly ardent in professional spirit. It will 
make but small appeal to those most in need of 
understanding and inspiration. 
VI 
Tue house organ for teachers may take the form 
of a magazine or that of a small newspaper. The 
newspaper form lends itself more readily to a 
style of typography and arrangement that makes 
for attractive appearance. Though it presents 
more editorial and typographical difficulties than 
does the magazine, its appeal is likely to be 
quicker than that of the magazine unless the 
latter is unusually well done. The reason for 
this is in the fact that in the newspaper there are 
diversity and variety not usually found in the 
magazine. The human eye and the human 
mind seek variety; large masses of type, such as 
one is almost certain to find in the educational 
magazine, are formidable and are avoided by 
the average reader. 
The popular magazine breaks its monotony 
by generous use of illustrations and by adver- 
. tisements many of which have an appeal in art 
and arrangement that is almost irresistible. 
Private commercial concerns can and do put 
considerable sums in house organs issued in 
32
-P-A-G-E-43
PUBLICITY WITHIN SCHOOL SYSTEM 
magazine form, but school boards, forced to 
operate on limited revenues, probably would not 
be thought justified in going to similar expense. 
In a school system the house organ must be at- 
tractive without being elaborate. What an ex- 
pensive magazine can obtain in the way of appeal 
through beautiful art work the school publication 
must get through skillful typographical arrange- 
ment, with a minimum use of engravings. 
Hence, the newspaper form, all things consid- 
ered, is to be desired. 
VII 
Tue school administrator who desires to issue a 
professional journal for his teaching corps must 
give careful consideration to several questions of 
importance. Who shall edit it? Shall the edi- 
tor assume entire responsibility for the character 
and content of the journal or will he share this 
responsibility with others? What shall it con- 
tain? Where shall it be printed? How much 
will it cost? Can the cost be reduced by ob- 
taining the advertisements of business concerns? 
—and should it be so reduced? How often shall 
it appear? How shall it be distributed to teach- 
ers? Shall it go to parents? 
Selection of the editor may be difficult for the 
33
-P-A-G-E-44
PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
reason that it is hard to find in one person both 
the knowledge of education and the technical 
editing and publishing ability that are essential 
to the successful conduct of the enterprise. The 
ability and personality of the editor must be such 
as to command the respect and friendship of the 
many members of the superintendent’s staff and 
teaching corps with whom he comes in contact. 
It may be that an assistant superintendent or 
supervisor has had sufficient newspaper, maga- 
zine, or advertising experience to do the work. 
An educator trying to edit the publication and 
lacking such experience would be as much “at 
sea” as would a professional publicity man 
lacking a fundamental knowledge of education. 
Either would have to make good his deficiency 
before he could “make good” as editor. 
It is much simpler, in order to create an editor, 
to have one of the assistant superintendents or 
supervisors spend a summer vacation or a longer 
period on the staff of a newspaper in order to 
grasp some of the essentials of editing. The edi- 
tor of one of the local dailies might be willing to 
arrange for such training. 
It is possible that a school principal or a teacher 
of exceptional ability may have had newspaper 
or magazine experience at some time and may 
34 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
    
PUBLICITY WITHIN SCHOOL SYSTEM 
meet the rather exacting requirements of the job. 
Or it may be that a writer on one of the local 
newspapers may be employed as editor. If he is 
a man of excellent education (many of them are), 
if he has covered the school beat sufficiently long 
to familiarize himself with the philosophy and 
technique of education, or if he has had consid- 
erable experience as a school teacher before en- 
tering the newspaper profession, and if he can 
command the respect of the school people, he 
might edit the publication with fair or marked 
success. It would be necessary probably to pay 
him a salary equal to that of a supervisor or as- 
sistant superintendent in order to induce him to 
come into the school system. An editor obtained 
for less probably would not be worth the hiring. 
If he does his work well, the money paid him will 
be justified many times over in increased effi- 
ciency throughout the school system — an effi- 
ciency that should make it possible to keep down 
supervision costs. 
VIII 
No one person should bear the entire responsi- 
bility for the character and conduct of the house 
organ. One of the gravest dangers of this type 
of publicity medium in a private business or a 
35
-P-A-G-E-46
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
public school system lies in the fact that its read- 
ers may suspect it is being used to ‘‘put some- 
thing over on them.” Some of the commercial 
house organs do contain more or less specious 
philosophy, articles of the flattering “hand- 
shaking” variety which, among intelligent read- 
ers, breed distrust and contempt, destroying the 
effectiveness of the undertaking. 
Probably the best safeguard against this dan- 
ger in the conduct of a teachers’ house organ is 
an editorial board on which are represented the 
principals and classroom teachers as well as the 
superintendent and board of education. 
The editorial board should include either the 
superintendent himself or one of his assistants 
acting as his representative. Its personnel 
should include a member of the board of educa- 
tion, representing that body and elected or ap- 
pointed by it. It should include a school prin- 
cipal chosen for this duty by his fellow principals, 
And finally, there should be on the board teach- 
ers from the elementary, junior high, and senior 
high schools — all chosen by the ballots of their 
fellow teachers. 
The editorial board should pass on every arti- 
cle submitted by the editor for publication in 
the paper or magazine and on every editorial 
36
-P-A-G-E-47
. PUBLICITY WITHIN SCHOOL SYSTEM 
policy. No policy should stand and no arti- 
cle should be printed which the majority of the 
board vote down. Most of the readers of the 
organ being classroom teachers, it is not only 
just but advisable to have their representatives 
comprise the larger part of the editorial board. 
No fair-minded board of education or superin- 
tendent need fear that such power will be mis- 
used. 
The efficient and honest superintendent will 
welcome any safeguard against the organ’s being 
utilized to obtain any selfish end sought by a 
member of the board of education or by a member 
of his staff. The publication must try to be not 
only transparently honest, but must go the limit 
in safeguarding that honesty. Its sole aim must 
be better education for the children of the com- 
munity. 
Personnel of the editorial board should change 
annually so that many different teachers and 
principals, during the course of a few years, will 
have served on it. Thus there will be growing up 
in the school system a body of editorial board 
“alumni” whose past experience as board mem- 
bers will be the foundation for ever-increasing 
understanding of and confidence in the publica- 
tion among the teaching body. It is not so es- 
37 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
) 
PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
sential that the rest of the personnel of the board, 
comprising the superintendent’s representative 
and the representative of the board of education, 
undergo annual change. 
| In addition to passing on editorial policies and 
articles submitted for publication, members of 
the editorial board can render valuable service by 
pointing out to the editor bad situations which 
publicity can correct, excellent teaching methods 
and projects which if ‘written up” would be | 
of interest, help, and inspiration to the entire | 
system. 
The editorial board should meet before every 
issue of the publication, the editor acting as 
chairman of the meeting. The session need not 
last longer than an hour and a half. The actual 
work of the board members, highly important as 
it is, should involve but little labor on their part. 
It is upon the editor that the burden of labor 
falls. His is the task of preparing material for 
publication, of selecting illustrations, of writing 
headlines, of making up the pages, and of seeing 
to the hundred and one details of interviewing, 
editing, printing, and distribution. He must at- 
tend the staff meetings of the superintendent and 
be in close touch with him. He must keep 
abreast of the latest developments in education 
38 
   
-P-A-G-E-49
PUBLICITY WITHIN SCHOOL SYSTEM 
and must know what the school system is accom- 
plishing now and what it should aim to accom- 
plish in the future. He must be thoroughly 
familiar with the administration’s policies and 
problems. 
Ix 
Tue duty of the editor, as above indicated, sug- 
gests what the content of the teachers’ house 
organ should be. It is the editor’s business and 
that of the editorial board to keep the tone of the 
publication professional, to avoid the printing of 
articles that might be interpreted as serving any 
political, personal, or commercial group. 
Every article printed in the teachers’ house 
organ should be interesting and helpful to all or 
to a considerable portion of the readers. The 
secret of good writing and of good editing lies in 
the selection of the most interesting facts and 
comments and the rejection of the dull and com- 
monplace. :

A number of very long articles in any one issue 
of such a publication makes it dull and heavy. 
When articles are of considerable length the 
capable editor will make them as attractive as 
possible by ingenious typographical arrangement. 
The editor will use many articles written by 
others than himself. By so doing he avoids the 
danger of dullness that is likely to mark any 
publication every issue of which is entirely the 
work of one person. He insures variety in 
subject-matter and point of view; he increases 
the interest of the readers in the publication and 
makes it more of a mirror reflecting the accom- 
plishments and the professional opinions of the 
members of the teaching corps, as well as those 
4I

of the superintendent. The acceptance by the 
publication of an article written by a teacher or 
principal, moreover, is an encouraging recogni- 
tion of the writer’s contribution to education. 
This has direct bearing on the system’s morale 
and efficiency, for encouragement and recogni- 
tion are forces which lift men and women to 
higher levels of attainment and happiness in 
work. 
x 
THE question of printing the publication should 
be left to the editor, who, of course, will specify 
the most attractive journal that can be paid for 
out of the budget allowance set aside for the 
activity. 
The editor will determine the form of the 
journal — whether it is to be magazine or news- 
paper; he will decide on the varieties and sizes of 
type, the style of headlines, the width and depth 
of columns, the kind of paper stock, and other 
technical details. 
When the editor has completed his specifica- 
tions and has had them approved by the superin- 
tendent, he will obtain the services of the printing 
plant which can do the quality and quantity of 
work specified at the lowest cost. Perhaps a 
42

high school or trade school in the system itself 
will have the linotype and press equipment to 
handle the job on the scheduled time. Very 
likely it will be necessary to have the printing 
done by a commercial publishing house, in which 
case the system’s purchasing department will ask 
for bids in the usual way. 
The printing departments of American school 
systems are organized, in the majority of cases, 
for the teaching of printing. Publication of the 
teachers’ house organ is an undertaking requir- 
ing too much technical skill for the average 
school print shop to undertake. The attractive- 
ness of the publication should not be sacrificed 
to give laboratory work to students in printing 
classes who can better obtain their practical ex- 
perience in the preparation of the many cards, 
announcements, folders, and simpler printing 
jobs that are myriad in every public school sys- 
tem. Many of the technical factors involved in 
the “make-up” of student publications apply 
to the typography of the teachers’ house organ. 
These are discussed in Chapter VII. 
XI 
Cost of a teachers’ house organ will depend, 
of course, on many factors — size, style, paper 
43 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
stock, engravings, number of copies, etc. In 
general it may be said that five thousand copies 
of a four-page, five-column newspaper, ten inches 
wide by fourteen inches deep, or of a small 
magazine five and three fourths inches wide by 
eight and a half inches deep, and running about 
thirty-two pages, can be published for about 
$r50 per issue. 
Figures more definite than this would be of 
little worth here because of the variation in con- 
ditions under which school printing jobs are done. 
Printing, like photography, is an art. You can 
have a photographic likeness of yourself made for 
twenty-five cents or twenty-five dollars, the dif- 
ference in price representing the difference in 
material and artistic skill utilized in the obtaining 
of the finished products. An issue of a school 
house organ might cost seventy-five dollars or 
two hundred dollars, depending upon the quality 
of the printing and illustrations used. 
Few boards of education are in a position to 
buy printing service of exceptionally high quality. 
Most of them, as a result of laws specifying that 
contracts be awarded to low bidders, must ac- 
cept printing that seldom is better than mediocre. 
For this reason it is especially necessary that the 
editor of the school house organ carefully specify 
44  
-P-A-G-E-55
PUBLICITY WITHIN SCHOOL SYSTEM 
paper stock, styles and sizes of type and head- 
lines, and time of delivery. The printer re- 
ceiving the contract for the job, which may be 
let annually, should be placed under bond guar- 
anteeing that he carry out specifications. For- _ 
feiture of contract and remuneration to the board 
for any loss it suffers through failure of printer 
to meet specifications should be included in the 
contract. Printer’s mistakes are corrected at 
the expense of the printer. Other alterations 
—and they are frequently necessary after copy 
has been set in type — should be provided at 
cost. 
The expense of printing the house organ may 
be reduced or entirely covered by the sale of ad- 
vertising space. This, however, is not advisable. 
It brings the board of education into the field of 
private commercial enterprise. Even if the laws 
under which the board functions permit such 
activity — and in some States they do not per- 
mit it — the board’s competition with legitimate 
media of commercial publicity is to be seriously 
questioned. 
Moreover, a board of education must re- 
member that the appearance of an advertise- 
ment in the official publication of the schools 
carries with it the board’s tacit approval or 
45 
   
-P-A-G-E-56
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
sanction of the article or service advertised. A 
single dishonest advertisement could result in 
much harm. Suppose, for example, that a 
brokerage firm advertised in the school house 
organ an issue of stock; suppose that teach- 
ers, reading the advertisement and believing the 
stock safe, purchased it; and suppose the stock 
turned out to be worthless. The board of edu- 
cation as well as the brokerage firm would re- 
ceive the censure and inspire the distrust of an 
indignant teaching corps; and the influence of the 
house organ for good would be lessened. 
If advertisements are to be accepted at all, it 
should be only after thorough safeguards have 
been set up. There should be full assurance that 
the influential media of commercial publicity, 
such as the daily newspapers, will make no ob- 
jection to the board’s ertering their field. A 
permanent committee should be organized to 
scrutinize and pass on all advertisements sub- 
mitted. Citizens in whom the board and the 
teaching corps have full confidence should be 
asked to serve on this committee. The local 
Advertising Club might provide such a com- 
mittee to serve without pay. Perhaps the 
club’s “better business commission,” organized 
for the express purpose of eliminating dishonesty 
46
-P-A-G-E-57
  PUBLICITY WITHIN SCHOOL SYSTEM 
in advertising, would undertake to guarantee the 
trustworthiness of -all advertisements accepted 
by the house organ. In case such an arrange- 
ment were made, it should be indicated in a 
standing note on the editorial page. Even with 
this arrangement, all would not be smooth 
sailing. Certain advertisements might be re- 
jected and the board of education might thus 
incur the enmity of the firms offering them. 
Furthermore, if advertising were sold to 
finance the publication it would be necessary to 
establish fair rates — sufficiently high to make a 
profit for the publication and low enough to at- 
tract advertisers. Here again the local Adver- 
tising Club could be of assistance by recommend- 
ing a just scale of rates. 
It is possible that the labor of obtaining the ad- 
vertisements and of keeping books and making 
collections might offset much of the profit in the 
ads. Unless the publication must have the in- 
come from advertisements in order to exist, it 
had better get along without them. 
XII 
SEVERAL factors will govern the frequency of ap- 
pearance of the publication: the “psychology” 
of the situation; the budget allowance for the 
47
-P-A-G-E-58
re ey een nner 
PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
activity; the time which the editor can give to it. 
Too frequent an appearance of a journal de- 
voted entirely to the professional consideration 
of education would cause lack of interest and 
would work against the best accomplishment of 
its purpose. This is true in other fields. Very 
few magazines appear oftener than once a week; 
some appear fortnightly, some monthly, and a 
few appear quarterly. If the Saturday Evening 
Post, or Life, or The Christian Herald, or The 
Nation were issued oftener than once a week, it is 
probable they would lose readers and prestige. 
This is the “psychological factor.” It is based 
on the fact that most people have neither the 
time nor the desire for too frequent doses of any 
one subject, even of humor. 
If there is money enough in the budget and if 
the editor does not have too many other duties, a 
fortnightly appearance of the journal seems the 
most desirable. An assistant superintendent or 
supervisor acting as editor would need to give 
a third to half of his time to the journal which is 
issued fortnightly and would require stenographic 
and office assistance for the task. 
If a person is specially employed to edit the 
house organ — and he should be employed on a 
full-time basis — he should be able, with sten- 
48
-P-A-G-E-59
PUBLICITY WITHIN SCHOOL SYSTEM 
ographic and office assistance, to issue the pub- 
lication every week that the schools are in 
session. 
It is more desirable, however, to have the pub- 
lication issued fortnightly and to place the full- 
time editor in charge of other publications such 
as the annual report, monographs, courses of 
study, the school directory, etc. His knowledge 
of printing methods and of editing should bring 
a standardization in such publications to result 
in their greater attractiveness and utility while 
eliminating needless expenditure. 
The saving which a skillful editor can accom- 
plish on routine publications may be sufficient to 
finance the teachers’ house organ. For example: 
some American public school systems for years 
have been issuing ponderous annual reports filled 
with lengthy statistical tables which are exceed- 
ingly difficult to put into type. Some of these 
reports cost from three thousand dollars to four 
thousand dollars —a sum sufficient to finance 
the house organ for an entire school year. The 
reports are read by very few persons. They are 
kept for reference purposes only. Mimeographed 
tables, kept in the proper offices, would answer 
just as well for reference. 
The skillful editor will make a brief and read- 
49
-P-A-G-E-60
PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
able abstract of the lengthy report and will get 
the gist of the facts shown by the intricate tables 
into graphic form. He will cut the publication 
expense from several thousand dollars down to a 
few hundred dollars, and the report in the ab- 
breviated form will be actually read instead of 
merely gathering dust on a reference shelf. 
The more striking features of the annual re- 
port can be published also in the teachers’ house 
organ. ‘The house organ itself, indeed, can be 
something of a continuous report of the accom- 
plishments, the aims, and the needs of the schools. 
XIII 
As soon as an issue of the house organ is off the 
press, it should be distributed at once to its read- 
ers. Delay in distribution will result in some of 
the articles appearing stale. The time element is 
important in the case of magazines and news- 
papers; the organ of the schools cannot neglect it. 
If the school system occupies scores or hundreds 
of square miles of territory, the copies of the 
publication can be sent to the different schools 
through the mails. In a smaller system it can be 
distributed by board of education delivery auto- 
mobiles. 
50

Tue house organ should be primarily for teach- 
ers. It should not go to all parents. The school 
system’s right to utilize the printed word in pro- 
moting the understanding and efficiency of its 
teaching force cannot be questioned. The prac- 
tice of sending a board of education newspaper to 
parents, irrespective of whether parents wish to 
receive it or not, is open to serious question. 
But, though the teachers’ house organ is pri- 
marily for the teachers, it will appeal to, and 
may properly circulate among, those citizens and 
parents who have unusual interest in and knowl- 
edge of professional education. Such persons 
should, of course, receive the publication if they 
wishit. If there is not sufficient money available 
to print the extra copies required for them, 
teachers may be requested to turn over to in- 
terested citizens and parents their own copies 
after they have read them. 
The publication should be sent to all city, 
county, and State officials whose duties involve 
any direct or indirect codperation with the 
schools. Members of the Legislature, for in- 
stance, should be on the mailing list. Familiar- 
ity with the problems and work of the schools, 
51 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
gained through the publication, will assist them 
in the formulation of wiser school legislation. 
An ample supply of copies to supply the re- 
quirements of the public library and its branches 
should be printed; other copies should go to va- 
rious civic bodies including parent-teacher organ- 
izations; others should be mailed to the art mu- 
seum, the natural history museum, and other 
educational, quasi-educational, and welfare or- 
ganizations which are in greater or less contact 
with the public schools. All undergraduates in 
the system’s teacher-training institution should, 
of course, receive copies. 
It will be found desirable to place on the mail- 
ing list the names of superintendents, deans 
of colleges of education, and teacher-training 
schools, editors of professional educational jour- 
nals, editors of teachers’ house organs in other 
school systems, editors of local newspapers and 
magazines, and others who wish the publica- 
tion, and who, by reading it, not only will receive 
knowledge of the school system, but will be in a 
position to give helpful advice or suggestion to 
the system. No subscription price need be made 
for such copies. None, of course, is made to the 
teachers of the system. 
It may be suggested to “outsiders” receiving 
52
-P-A-G-E-63
  PUBLICITY WITHIN SCHOOL SYSTEM 
the publication that they may pay for it, if they 
like, by making helpful suggestion and criticism 
on the basis of what they find in it. 
Once a year the mailing list should be revised 
to the end that every copy sent to “outsiders” is 
received by a person who really wishes it. It is 
wasteful to send literature to persons who merely 
throw it into the waste-basket. Send a letter 
once a year asking persons on the outsiders’ 
mailing list to indicate on the postcard enclosed 
whether or not they wish to continue to receive 
the publication. 
XV 
Mucs of what has been written about the teach- 
ers’ house organ applies with equal force to pub- 
lications of teachers’ associations and federations. 
Some of these groups are publishing excellent and 
helpful magazines. Practically all of these must 
be financed by advertisements and by charging 
a subscription price. 
It is a question whether a professional organ- 
ization of teachers in a school system should be 
expected to go to the trouble and expense of 
publishing a magazine to promote a professional 
growth which the board of education itself might 
rightly be expected to finance. 
53
-P-A-G-E-64
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
A splendid manifestation of the professional 
spirit is shown in the numerous publications of 
teachers’ groups in many communities. These 
groups have not waited for the superintendent 
and the board of education to take the initiative. 
They have taken it themselves. However, their 
own desire for professional growth hardly ex- 
cuses the lack of such desire on the part of the 
superintendent and the board of education. It 
is as much a legitimate expenditure of time and 
of money to promote understanding and morale 
through a teachers’ house organ in a large school 
system as it is to promote these ends through 
teachers’ meetings and supervision. So excellent 
are many of the group publications referred to that 
it is doubtful if their sponsors at this time would 
care to have them replaced by an official board 
of education journal. Even when the school 
board undertakes the responsibility for a publica- 
tion carrying articles of professional interest, 
there remains a need for an organization bulletin. 
But it can be simply a mimeographed bulletin, 
concerned with the routine business of the organ- 
ization. 
So long as teachers have confidence in the 
superintendent, their professional organization 
will not object to an official publication financed 
54 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  PUBLICITY WITHIN SCHOOL SYSTEM 
by the board of education and safeguarded by 
the methods indicated in this chapter. And 
if they do not have this confidence, it becomes 
the superintendent’s chief administrative duty to 
see that they do have it. One of his greatest 
helps, next to his own ability, sincerity, and hon- 
esty of purpose, will be the establishment of a 
really excellent teachers’ house organ.
-P-A-G-E-66
  III 
INFORMATION SERVICE 
I 
OF such outstanding importance in every public 
school system is the relationship between the 
schools and the public that the superintendent 
must have it always in mind. He must make 
education popular in every sense of the word. 
This is one of his major responsibilities. 
It is quite as logical for the superintendent of a 
large school system to have an assistant assigned 
to the maintenance of honest relationship with 
the public as it is for him to have assistants for 
administration of elementary, junior high, senior 
high, and trade schools. In a school system 
which is publishing a house organ, the editor of 
the publication is the logical person to be in 
charge of the information service. For the sake 
of convenience in this discussion the official in 
charge of this service is referred to as director of 
information. In actual practice, however, it is 
not expedient to use the title for the reason that 
the phrase may carry some implication of the 
56
-P-A-G-E-67
INFORMATION SERVICE 
selective process in the giving out of facts which 
is so closely associated with censorship. 
There are few if any school systems in which 
one person’s full time would be given to informa- 
tion service. It is better to refer to this person 
by the title which goes with his other duties. If 
he is an assistant superintendent call him that. 
If he is in charge of the board of education publi- 
cations call him director of publications. 
It is essential that this official have a good 
understanding of newspapers and their methods, 
that he be a person whom the newspapers and 
the school personnel alike will respect for his 
ability, honesty, and fair-mindedness, for his 
duties will involve constant codperation with 
both and occasional coéperation with various 
civic groups and citizens desiring facts about 
the schools. The director of information must 
interpret the schools and their activities to 
the newspaper reporters; also he must interpret 
the newspapers and their methods to the edu- 
cators. 
The necessity for this interpretive function is 
evident when the situation in the usual American 
city is analyzed. Most professional educators 
do not understand newspapers. Many news- 
paper writers lack understanding of educational 
57
-P-A-G-E-68
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
philosophy and methods. Many of them do not 
see the school system as a fundamental thing es- 
sential to the continued existence of a sound or- 
ganization of society. They do not recognize in 
the work of the schools, as it goes forward day 
by day, week by week, year by year, a process 
vastly greater in importance than the sensational 
but ephemeral disputes which may occur in busi- 
ness meetings of the board of education. 
Whether the new junior high school structure 
shall be built of stone or brick — a matter involv- 
ing a price difference of $25,000 or $50,000 — 
may cause differences of opinion which get large 
space in the newspapers; but this is a trifling 
matter when compared with the teaching that 
characterizes the high school when it is in opera- 
tion. 
That more news of the most important activi- 
ties of the public schools is not printed is due 
largely to the fact that schoolmen too often talk 
a professional language so filled with technical 
terms that it does not interest the layman. The 
newspaper man is as much a layman in educa- 
tion as is the professional educator in newspaper 
methods. Translate education into the simple 
terms of child welfare, and it becomes the basis 
of constructive news stories of sufficient interest 
58
-P-A-G-E-69
INFORMATION SERVICE 
to compete successfully with stories of other activ- 
ities of the day. 
Here the director of educational information 
can be of service. He will seize every opportu- 
nity to bring to the educators knowledge of those 
things in which the newspaper is interested and 
to suggest to them such methods of presentation 
as will be interesting to newspaper writers. To 
the newspaper reporters who cover the schools 
the director of information will so interpret edu- 
cational philosophy and methods that they may 
know the significance of what the schools are 
doing and see important stories in activities 
which, otherwise, might be wrongly interpreted 
or entirely neglected. 
I 
Tue director of educational information should 
be a member of the superintendent’s staff so that 
he may have intimate knowledge of the adminis- 
tration policies and activities. He must know 
about the most interesting and important class- 
room activities throughout the system. If he is 
also editor of the teachers’ house organ and in 
charge of publication of reports, monographs, 
and courses of study, he will, in the discharge of 
his editorial duties, come into possession of much 
59
-P-A-G-E-70
re ee ne re ee 
PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
information which, if adequately interpreted, will 
appeal to the newspaper writers as having news 
value. 
All school officials and principals should be 
encouraged to keep the department of informa- 
tion informed about significant phases of the 
work of which they are in charge. 
If the director of information is to achieve any 
pronounced success in obtaining codperation from 
these persons, he must undertake to educate 
them in news values. 
The task will not be easy. Professional edu- 
cators, in common with other professional people, 
do not like to be quoted in the public press. They 
fear—and sometimes not without reason — that 
the newspapers will distort or garble their state- 
ments, either as a result of a desire to be sensa- 
tional or because of the reporters’ inability to un- 
derstand and interpret professional knowledge. 
In either case they may be humiliated or em- 
barrassed, or misinformation about their activi- 
ties may be broadcast. Again, many of them 
being modest, fine-grained, and sensitive, dread 
the limelight. The mere suggestion that what 
they say may appear in headlines and news col- 
umns puts them in fear and trembling. They 
will hesitate to give to the director of informa- 
60 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  INFORMATION SERVICE 
tion any facts which may result in his sending 
reporters to them. The director of information 
cannot but sympathize with these school people 
who dislike or fear newspaper publicity. Yet, 
while sympathizing, he must seek to break down 
their prejudice, for it is more important that the 
public receive information about the schools 
through the newspapers than that the educators 
enjoy immunity from press interviews. 
It is quite proper that the personal rights of 
the professional educator in a public school sys- 
tem be respected, but it is none the less true 
that the educator is a public servant. His work 
is done for the public. His salary is paid by the 
public. It is his duty, in the light of professional 
standards, to give what assistance he can to the 
end that the public know about the work and 
aims of the schools. The newspaper, notwith- 
standing its limitations, is too important an 
avenue to public opinion to be ignored. It is, 
in fact, the outstanding medium utilizing the 
printed word by which the public is to be in- 
formed. Notwithstanding its sins of omission 
and commission, it can, with the codperation of 
the school authorities, render invaluable service 
to the cause of public school education. 
The more one knows about newspapers and 
61
-P-A-G-E-72
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
their methods and problems, the less one fears 
them. It is as much the duty of the director of 
information to see that the newspaper’s point of 
view is presented to the school people as to seek 
to bring to the newspaper the point of view of 
the educator. 
In educating the school people in newspaper 
methods and problems, the director of informa- 
tion has recourse to several means. He can 
publish occasional articles in the teachers’ house 
organ to make clear the possibilities and methods 
of codperation with the press. Some of these he 
may write himself; others may be prepared by 
responsible newspaper workers. Occasionally a 
newspaper editor may be asked by the superin- 
tendent of schools to speak before the superin- 
tendent’s staff and also perhaps before the prin- 
cipals. Following an address of this nature, 
there may be a period of informal discussion 
which may reveal and tend to eliminate misun- 
derstandings on the part of the newspapers and 
schools alike. 
As pointed out elsewhere in this book, the 
setting up of a journalism course in the high 
schools and the teacher-training school can lead 
to marked advances in codperation between the 
school system and the press of the community. 
62
-P-A-G-E-73
  INFORMATION SERVICE 
Or 
As the school employees reach a larger under- 
standing of the newspapers, the work of the di- 
rector of information will be facilitated. The 
amount of information flowing into his office 
from the different schools and departments will 
increase in quantity and news value. This in- 
formation will be given orally to reporters who 
call at his office. It will take the form of sug- 
gestions for news or feature stories. The re- 
porters may follow these or not, as they choose. 
The department of information, in so far as it 
has to do with the daily newspapers, will not 
represent a consolidation of news sources; it will 
not close any school office or department to 
hewspaper representatives or to others seeking 
information. Rather, it will mention to report- 
ers and others facts and ideas which will lead 
them, if they are sufficiently interested, to the 
original sources of school news. 
A few examples may be indicated. 
A reporter calls at the information office. He 
may be in a hurry and want a few good tips at 
once, or he may wish to chat casually on different 
topics. In any event, he is almost certain before 
his departure to ask :“‘ Well ;what’sdoing to-day?” 
63
-P-A-G-E-74
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
“Let me see,” says the director, who consults 
his mental or written notes. ‘‘Oh, yes, it looks 
as though there’d be a story down in the finance 
department. I understand an additional tax 
levy may be necessary to provide for the in- 
creased high-school enrollment. If that’s so, 
it may mean a special ballot in April. Better 
see Smith down there — he knows all about it. 
You can get enrollment figures from the superin- 
tendent’s secretary. The superintendent may 
have something to say about it. The situation 
is caused, I understand, by the new State law 
raising school attendance age.” 
“Yes, that may work up into a pretty fair 
story,” says the reporter. ‘‘ What else is there?” 
The director consults his memory or notes: 
“You had better get to the school board com- 
mittee meeting this afternoon to see if that state- 
ment on the new junior high policy is ready. I 
don’t know whether there’ll be anything very 
interesting in it, but it may bear watching. 
“There’s a pretty fair feature at Kennard Jun- 
ior. They make up a roll of honor out there every 
semester for scholarship, character, and general 
service to the school. The top place on that roll 
has just gone to a blind boy. He’s totally blind. 
He has run an average of 95 in his studies. He’s 
64
-P-A-G-E-75
  INFORMATION SERVICE 
a member of the boys’ gym team; he has organ- 
ized an orchestra and has taken a prize in public 
speaking. He must be popular, too, for he’s 
been elected president of his class.” 
“What sort of picture could we get of him? 
Would he show up well in a photo?” asks the 
reporter. 
“I don’t know. You might telephone the 
principal out there. 
“There’s another thing I think of that might 
interest you. The health education department 
is getting some protests from parents against the 
use of that new diphtheria antitoxin. The doctor 
may not want to talk on the subject until the 
protests come up before the board — that is, he 
may not want to talk for publication. But you 
might get set for the story by having him give 
you the outline of the diphtheria prevention pro- 
gram. I know he is ready to do that.” 
In such manner the information goes to all the 
reporters, if they care to call for it. The director 
of the department merely suggests possible news 
and leaves it to the reporters to obtain the details 
in first-hand personal or telephone interviews 
with the school officials directly concerned. 
Many possibilities for readable news stories 
will be uncovered during the course of casual con- 
65
-P-A-G-E-76
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
versations between the director and the news- 
paper representatives when the latter have time 
for a friendly chat. Even the discussion of 
topics far afield from education may lead to ex- 
cellent school stories. The reporter’s comment 
on women’s clothes may recall to the director that 
the girls of East High School have formed a 
“Sensible Dress Club.”? A conversation con- 
cerning the home ball team’s chances to win the 
league pennant may give rise to a question con- 
cerning baseball as part of the schools’ physical 
training program and may reveal the news that 
many boys’ and girls’ baseball teams are to be 
organized in the upper elementary grades and the 
junior high schools of the community. 
IV 
As every newspaper man knows, many of the 
best news stories reveal themselves in the course 
of casual conversation. A chance comment or 
temark frequently throws the trained news- 
gatherer upon the scent of facts which will merit 
first-page position. A great deal of the news 
that gets into the papers is, in fact, of this variety 
in its origin. 
Every school system should have at least one 
responsible official who is fairly well informed on
-P-A-G-E-77
INFORMATION SERVICE 
the many activities of the system and who can 
give to the newspaper reporters all the time they 
desire. News stories that are accurate and 
written in full understanding of their subject- 
matter are not developed in brief, hurried con- 
versation with impatient officials. In a large 
school system the director of information should 
stand out as one official who is always ready to 
give fully of his time to the reporters. If he is 
charged also with responsibility for editing the 
teachers’ house organ and other publications, he 
will, of course, require competent office assist- 
arts to help in the routine work of the depart- 
ment. 
The great demand which the interpretive 
function makes u, on one’s time is sufficient 
reason why the big-city superintendent cannot 
devote himself to its details. When a large 
school system has a department of educational 
information, the superintendent will find himself 
giving more interviews to newspaper reporters, 
but he will discover that their demands upon his 
time are less than in the days when there was no 
information department. The reason for this 
will be in the fact that the reporters, ore than 
in the past, will come to the superintendent’s 
office with definite questions which can be quickly 
67

  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
answered. When the reporters get the outstand- 
ing facts on significant processes, acts, policies, 
or activities from the director of information, 
they usually can obtain the superintendent’s or 
any other official’s views on the matter in a brief 
interview. The director of information, if he 
does his work properly, will translate school 
news into terms that anybody can understand; 
that is, into terms of child welfare. 
Take, for example, the matter of intelligence 
testing. This is not readily understood by the 
layman. If the explanation to the reporter is 
technical, it is possible that the story he writes 
may result in actual harm. Out of the involved 
talk about intelligence quotients and segregation 
of pupils into groups, the reporter may picture 
the public schools as pursuing methods which 
trample ruthlessly on democracy. He may em- 
phasize, in his news story, a denial of America’s 
foundation principle of equality. 
The proper explanation of intelligence testing 
will show that the aim of the tests is to give to 
every pupil full opportunity to develop to the 
limit of his powers. It will show these tests as 
determinants of those special capacities and apti- 
tudes which educators must consider if they are 
to regard children as individuals rather than as 
68
-P-A-G-E-79
INFORMATION SERVICE 
groups and classes. ‘The explanation will em- 
phasize the fact that, as every child is an indi- 
vidual with particular powers and capacity, he 
should have the best possible opportunity to 
make the most of himself by being placed in a 
group in which his individuality will have full 
play. 
If there are shortcomings in intelligence test- 
ing, the explanation will admit them frankly; but 
the administration’s reasons for making use of 
the tests will be set forth fully from the stand- 
point of advantages that may accrue to the chil- 
dren of the schools. 
A subject of this kind is not explained in 
twenty minutes, nor in an hour. It is not likely 
that a superintendent in a big city would have 
the time, even if he had the newspaper “‘slant,” 
to acquaint the reporters with the working and 
potential results of intelligence testing. 
After receiving the initial explanation, couched 
in ordinary English, with every technical expres- 
sion defined and explained, the reporter should 
be shown the actual application of the tests. He 
should be warned, of course, that a reproduction 
in the newspaper of the tests used in the local 
schools would spoil them for future use. If his 
interest is sufficient, he should be directed to 
69
-P-A-G-E-80
  
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
classes for various groups of children including 
the especially gifted. If he decides to tell the 
public about this new thing in education, he will 
want to interview the superintendent of schools, 
the person in general charge of the administration 
of the tests, the school psychologist, if there be 
one, and perhaps a number of principals and 
teachers throughout the system who can tell him 
what the tests are accomplishing in actual results. 
The director of information, by being thoroughly 
familiar with the tests and their use, can be of 
great assistance to the reporter. 
Scores of similar examples might be given. 
In carrying on this activity the director of in- 
formation must not be a “press agent.” He 
should not write articles for the local papers un- 
less the papers request him to do so, and he should 
not encourage such requests. Any effort on his 
part to have the newspapers report specific 
phases of the school activities is likely to be 
viewed with suspicion except in very special 
cases. Once the newspapers begin to feel that 
the director of information is employed to ad- 
vertise the good deeds of the administration and 
to keep still about its mistakes, his work will 
be vitiated — it will become harmful instead of 
useful. 
70
-P-A-G-E-81
INFORMATION SERVICE 
The director should seek to open every door to 
the reporters so that they may, with speed and 
convenience, see all of the workings of the sys- 
tem and know all of the facts — bad as well as 
good, unfavorable as well as favorable. 
His attitude should be such that it is equiva- 
lent to his saying to the reporters: “Gentlemen, 
these are the city’s public schools. They belong 
to the people. The people have a right to know 
how they are being managed, to what degree 
they are accomplishing worth-while results for 
the children, and to what degree they are failing 
to accomplish results. You are the representa- 
tives of the people. You visit the schools for 
them and you report on their condition. We 
want you to have every opportunity to see for 
yourselves all that is being done, to judge for 
yourselves how well it is being done. You should 
see this for yourselves that you may write, from 
your own point of view and in your own way, 
those things which appeal to you as news. 
“You will see good work, indifferent work, 
bad work. All that the administration can ask is 
that you be as fair and honest toward it as it is 
toward you and the public. As good citizens, 
employed by fair-minded newspapers, you are as 
eager, no doubt, for the community to have an

excellent school system and to enjoy the reputa- 
tion for such a system as is the administration; 
you will avoid distortion or unjust emphasis of 
facts in writing school news, in order to make a 
sensational story quite as much as the superin- 
tendent will avoid exploitation of the system for 
personal, selfish ends. 
“We want you to have every facility for obtain- 
ing information at first hand, for interviewing 
anybody from the most obscure teacher to the 
superintendent. There is no gag rule. Bad 
work as well as good is open to sight and to crit- 
icism. Any adverse criticism that may spur the 
administration to better work or otherwise cor- 
rect existing evils should be welcomed by the 
schools. If there is any doubt as to whether any 
story should be printed, all that the administra- 
tion can demand in fairness, is that you ask your- 
selves this question: ‘ Will the publication of this 
story promote the welfare of the children?’ If 
the answer is ‘yes,’ the story should be printed, 
no matter how much it may hurt school officials.” 
It is quite evident, when philosophy of this 
sort characterizes the work of the director of 
information, that he cannot be a censor. Any 
covering-up of unpleasant facts is fraught with 
danger. The capable school administrator will 
72
-P-A-G-E-83
  
INFORMATION SERVICE 
not tolerate such censorship. If he is trying to 
the limit of his ability and to the full extent of 
the resources in money and personnel to give the 
community the best possible schools, he has noth- 
ing to fear. No one, not even the ablest school 
superintendent, is always perfect. Nor is his 
school system perfect. No one expects this. A 
frank admission of imperfections will accomplish 
far more in the building of a constructive rela- 
tionship between schools and public than any 
policy of ‘putting the best foot forward.” The 
superintendent will expect from all associates the 
same frankness; and he will take special pains to 
see that the department of educational informa- 
tion is conducted in this spirit. 
The director of information will seldom be 
quoted himself. Nor should it be his business 
to speak for the superintendent or other officials. 
Rather, he should know the interesting and sig- 
nificant things they are doing and should “tip 
the reporters off” to these things. Thus, in addi- 
tion to acting as an interpreter of educational 
philosophy and methods, he will make his office 
a clearing-house for information. After a re- 
porter receives suggestions or outlines of news 
stories here, he should be encouraged always to 
develop the stories at the sources, to interview the 
73 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
individuals directly concerned. This will pre- 
vent many misunderstandings and will eliminate 
any tendency toward “‘press-agentry.”” 
The director of educational information should 
lay so much stress on this point as to place him- 
self in a position in which he is not held responsi- 
ble for what the newspapers print or fail to print. 
He should convey to the newspapers and to 
others the impression that he knows but part of 
what is going on in the schools. Any other im- 
pression would be false, for it is quite impossible 
for any one person in a large school organization, 
even though he be a director of information, to 
know all that is being attempted and done. 
He should say to reporters and others, in sub- 
stance: “Those things which I know I shall be 
glad to tell you about; if you ask me questions 
Ican’t answer I shall frankly tell you I can’t 
answer them, and shall try to tell you where you 
can obtain the information you seek.” 
The directorship of educational information in 
a big system is a man-sized job. It should not be 
attempted as a side-line. It requires constant 
application and careful attention. 
It is to be assumed that a school administra- 
tion can deal frankly and honestly with the news- 
writers and at the same time follow the practice 
74
-P-A-G-E-85
  
INFORMATION SERVICE 
of common sense. News-writers, like other per- 
sons, vary in judgment, honesty, and other per- 
sonal qualities. Many of them are as devoted to 
the welfare of the school children as the con- 
scientious superintendent himself. Others —a 
minority — are not especially concerned with the 
children’s welfare and are correspondingly un- 
trustworthy when that welfare is at issue; a few 
are dishonest and unscrupulous. 
The degree to which a school official will take 
reporters into his confidence will be determined, 
in every case, by consideration of the welfare of 
the school children, and by the character of the 
reporter. 
With the intelligent and trustworthy news- 
writer the administrator can safely discuss in 
confidence many matters on which policies are 
not yet formulated or which, for other sound 
reasons, should not be made public. Occasion- 
ally such a news-writer can be of great help to 
the administrator by suggesting a course of ac- 
tion or a policy that will react to the good of the 
schools. For an actual instance let us go back 
to the days of the World War. 
Following America’s entrance into that con- 
flict, the public became inflamed with a hatred 
of everything German. The German language 
75
-P-A-G-E-86
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
was cast out of the schools. Persons suspected 
of favoring Germany were in danger of being 
lynched. Nearly everybody was hunting spies 
and pro-Germans. The country was in a fever. 
Just at that time, in one of the large Eastern 
cities, a delegation of excited citizens called 
at the office of the department of justice and 
reported that they were assured of the pro- 
Germanism of a large number of teachers in the 
city’s public schools and that they were con- 
vinced of the unpatriotic character of the ne 
administration. 
The chief of the bureau received the dethees 
tion and had his stenographer make full notes 
of the information and charges. He then asked 
members of the delegation to refrain from discuss- 
ing the situation with anybody until a careful 
investigation had been made. 
The investigation disclosed that the charges 
against the teachers and the school administra- 
tion were groundless, save for the misinterpreta- 
tion of a few indiscreet remarks made by one 
or two teachers. The patriotism of the school 
superintendent, his associates, and teaching corps 
was above question, and the self-appointed com- 
mittee of spy-hunters was notified accordingly. 
The frenzied members of the committee were 
76
-P-A-G-E-87
  INFORMATION SERVICE 
far from satisfied with the report. They wanted 
blood. They went so far as to accuse the bureau 
chief himself of being pro-German, and left his 
office declaring they would go to the newspa- 
pers with charges against the school administra- 
tion. 
A newspaper story of the kind that would 
have emanated from the committee would have 
brought disaster to the school administration and 
would have harmed the children greatly through 
the resulting dissension and clamor. 
At this juncture a newspaper man in whom 
both the bureau chief and the school superintend- 
ent had confidence was asked to have lunch with 
them. They laid the situation before him and 
asked his advice. 
“Tl tell you what to do,” said the reporter, 
addressing the superintendent. ‘You issue a 
statement of policy emphasizing your determina- 
tion to keep every suggestion of pro-Germanism 
out of the schools. Do this at once. Beat the 
committee to it. Get your publicity first and 
take the wind out of the committee’s sails. 
“You can indicate, and with truth, that you 
have had most careful investigation made of 
every report of pro-Germanism among teachers 
and other employees, and that you are satisfied 
7
-P-A-G-E-88
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
that the school personnel is stanchly American. 
“You can at this time say with all the force at 
your command that you will not give the name 
of any teacher against whom such charges have 
been falsely made; that to do so would be a grave 
injustice.” 
The superintendent accepted the reporter’s 
advice. The statement was issued and received 
prominent position in the papers. The super- 
intendent was applauded by the public. It is 
almost certain that the reporter’s advice saved 
that particular school administration from seri- 
ous embarrassment. 
From a standpoint of reader-interest the re- 
porter who was called into consultation made 
a sacrifice, for it is undoubtedly true that the 
committee’s sensational charges would have made 
livelier reading than the superintendent’s state- 
ment of policy. A thoughtless or unscrupulous 
reporter, knowing the committee’s charges, would 
have made them the basis of his story without 
considering the welfare of the schools. 
To matters of public record, however, even the 
unscrupulous reporter or the representative of 
an unscrupulous newspaper should have full and 
convenient access. Because they themselves are 
unfair is no reason why school officials should 
78
-P-A-G-E-89
INFORMATION SERVICE 
be so. Meet dishonesty with courtesy. This 
course can be followed with dignity and without 
sycophancy or hatred. When a school official is 
dealing with such a reporter, he can politely and 
firmly refuse information which he is certain will 
react against the school children if given to the 
reporter. 
Fortunately, newspaper workers who are dis- 
honest and unscrupulous are very much in the 
minority. Not infrequently reporters who write 
harmful and unjust stories do so, not because 
they are willingly vicious, but because they are 
thoughtless, immature, or lacking in compre- 
hension. Educators who courteously take pains 
to have such reporters recognize an obligation to 
child welfare are likely to make discoveries that 
will renew their faith in human nature and in the 
desire of the average man to be fair. 
Vv 
Tr has been reiterated that all sources of informa- 
tion should be open to newspaper writers and 
others and that no gag rule shall prevent school 
teachers, principals, and other employees from 
discussing phases of their work that are of legiti- 
mate public knowledge. It is to be expected, as 
a matter of course, that school employees will 
79 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
observe the practice of common sense and com- 
mon courtesy in the interviews they give to the 
press. 
No teacher, for example, should allow herself 
to be quoted on a matter which, by its nature, is 
a subject on which the principal rather than the 
teacher should speak. Similarly, it might well 
be held a form of insubordination for a principal 
to air his views publicly on a policy on which only 
his official superiors should speak. 
On the other hand, it is indefensible for the 
superintendent or other high officials to deny to 
teachers and principals the right to speak on 
matters that are properly within their province. 
It goes without saying that in any school sys- 
tem which is opened to the public and to the 
newspapers, and in which employees are not 
throttled, there will be mistakes and instances of 
thoughtlessness on the part of employees in giv- 
ing interviews to the press. But the harm re- 
sulting from these will be insignificant as com- 
pared to that flowing from an administrative 
policy of censorship. 
If members of the board of education and 
school officials are seeking selfish personal or | 
political advantage, they will naturally resort to 
throttling and gag rule to gain their ends. The

principles which this chapter has sought to enun- 
ciate and illustrate concern only the welfare of 
the school children and the improvement of edu- 
cation. 
School people in general and the director of 
information in particular must scrupulously 
avoid giving out any publicity which aims at the 
political or personal prestige of any individual 
rather than at the promotion of child welfare, but 
they must withhold no facts which the public is 
entitled to know about the work and aims of the 
schools.

Tue interest of public-spirited citizens in a com- 
munity’s school system is a factor on which every 
administrator can count as a natural avenue to 
the public at large. 
Frequently this interest is manifest in the 
organization of groups, such as parent-teacher 
societies, for the express purpose of parental co- 
operation. It is illustrated when the Rotary 
Club, the Chamber of Commerce, or some similar 
organization sets up a committee on education. 
In some communities civic bodies devoted to 
public welfare give much attention to study of the 
schools. Occasionally such a body will sponsor 
and pay the costs of a school survey. 
It sometimes happens that the membership of 
one or more of these groups may include mischief- 
making busybodies whose delight is the embar- 
rassment of the school administration. When 
this is the case, the administrator is in all the 
82

greater need of the groups whose interest is 
primarily constructive. Honest and efficient ad- 
ministrators need stand in no great fear of the 
sensational charges of fault-finding groups which 
are animated by motives of personal or political 
interest or simply by human “cussedness.” If 
the charges are of sufficient importance and if 
the fault-finding group has misled the public 
with sensational publicity, it may be advisable 
for the superintendent or board of education to 
ask a responsible body of citizens, whose honesty 
and motives are above question, to investigate 
the charges. 
Occasionally a civic organization devoted to 
public welfare will assume voluntarily the re- 
sponsibility for keeping all or part of the public 
informed about the schools. It may conduct 
open meetings at which school matters can be 
discussed; it may print and distribute folders or 
bulletins for the dissemination of information 
about the schools. The Public Education and 
Child Labor Association of Pennsylvania, for 
example, devotes many numbers of its monthly 
folder to the exposition and discussion of vital 
educational problems. It was under the auspices 
of this society that the Survey of the Philadelphia 
Public Schools, published in 1923, wasmade. To 
83
-P-A-G-E-94
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
every person or group which seeks information 
the wise administrator will give courteous, 
prompt, and adequate codperation. When the 
school administrator is asked to make an address 
before a civic society or body of citizens, he is 
presented with an excellent opportunity to reach 
the minds and hearts of school patrons. He 
should prepare his address carefully and be ready 
to answer all questions likely to be raised by his 
auditors. 
If the meeting to be addressed is to be covered 
by the newspapers, it would be advisable for 
the speaker to have prepared some typewritten 
copies or abstracts of his address (double-spaced) 
for presentation to reporters present in case they 
should desire them. It is not advisable, however, 
for a school official to bombard the newspapers 
with copies of his speeches. This practice, if 
persisted in, will cause editors and reporters to 
regard the offender as a “publicity hound,” by 
which is meant that type of individual who is 
eager to get his name and his words into the daily 
press.

representatives and to interested groups and in- 
dividuals. Every board meeting is an avenue, 
actual or potential, to the public mind. Board 
members, remembering this, will have all meet- 
ings of such character that newspaper or oral re- 
ports of them are likely to be to the best inter- 
ests of the schools. As Chapter V points out, a 
great deal of the news that gets into the papers 
concerns situations in which there are contests, 
opposing ideas, differences of opinion. It is 
proper that major and fundamental differences of 
opinion separating members or factions of the 
board should be made public; but it is neither 
necessary nor desirable that petty differences and 
bickerings be exposed to public view. Far less 
sensational and harmful news concerning school 
matters would be displayed in the daily press if 
board members were more careful in guarding 
their speech, if they were more willing to sacrifice 
their own egotisms for the good of the children in 
the schools. It is not to be expected, of course, 
that when the schools are “in politics,” the 
advice herein inferred will be followed. When 
board members represent a political group or a 
party organization, the welfare of the children is 
not likely to be the thing of major importance. 
The school board which is devoted to the cause 
85  
-P-A-G-E-96
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
of better schools can make good use of the oppor- 
tunity, presented by every board meeting, to 
translate the acts and proceedings of the meet- 
ing into terms of child welfare. Every policy 
adopted can be fully and adequately explained. 
Even though the members of the board under- 
stand them fully, complex situations should be 
clearly analyzed for the benefit of reporters and 
other visitors present. When typewritten re- 
ports or recommendations are prepared for the 
board members, extra copies should be made for 
the use of the newspaper reporters present. 
In financial matters, especially, it is important 
that the board of education present at its meet- 
ings clear, logical, timely, and convincing ac- 
counts of school expenditures and needs. As 
much as any other group the members of a board 
of education are in a position to obtain public 
understanding and support of necessary financial 
measures whether these be bond issues or tax 
levies. Unlike private business concerns and 
political parties, boards of education cannot 
employ lobbyists at the legislature. When lob- 
bying is done for a school system, it is usually 
done by public-spirited board members at their 
own expense. Because very few members have 
either the time or the money to lobby for this

activity, it follows that much school legislation is 
at the mercy of politicians and inadequately in- 
formed legislators unless the school authorities 
can create a public opinion before which the legis- 
lature must yield. 
snag 
Exursitions of the work of the pupils of a school, 
when well conducted, can bring interesting infor- 
mation to parents and can pave the way to in- 
creased parental codperation. 
Three types of school exhibition may be con- 
sidered: First, there is the exhibit of pupils’ work 
which is placed on display in some public place, 
such as the windows of a store or bank; second, 
the exhibit of pupils’ work on display in the 
school building to which parents come on a given 
afternoon or evening; third, the exhibit comprised 
by a special session of the school to which parents 
are invited and at which all classes are held and 
work goes on as at regular sessions. 
The third is largest in possibilities. It carries 
more authenticity than the others. Not only 
can it show, even in the intellectual field, some- 
thing of the finished product, but it can show also 
the methods by which that product is obtained 
in daily classroom work and recitation. 
87
-P-A-G-E-98
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
For any exhibit held at the school building, 
the principal and teachers should make careful 
preparation to insure attractive invitations to 
parents and orderly, hospitable arrangements for 
their reception. 
In an exhibit comprising a display of articles 
produced in the domestic science, manual train- 
ing, and other classes whose products can be 
made visible, well-lettered labels and the services 
of both teacher and pupil interpreters should be 
utilized. 
Every public school should have an exhibit or 
special session at least once a year. These affairs, 
which may be marked by much originality in in- 
vitation and conduct, are always occasions when 
teachers and parents can meet on common 
ground, which is by no means the least of their 
benefits. They should be conducted to give an 
accurate picture of what the school is attempting 
to accomplish — which is to say that immoderate 
effort to put the best foot forward is poor in taste 
and unwise in policy.

One of the burdens which modern social condi- 
tions have placed upon many public school sys- 
tems in America is that of responsibility for the

entertainment of adults and the recreation of 
children. Community centers and playgrounds, 
educational in the broad application of the term, 
are being added in increasing numbers to the 
load of the schools. 
Not a few school administrators, while admit- 
ting the necessity for and the good in these ac- 
tivities, take the view that they should be con- 
ducted by the city government or some other 
agency rather than by the schools. 
Admitting, though solely for the sake of the 
argument, that such administrators are right, 
community centers and playgrounds, besides 
tendering service to the community, are not 
without benefit to the schools. They form 
points of contact with the public and thus open 
yet another avenue whereby the schoolrsystem 
as a whole may obtain public support. 
In similar manner the extra-school use of school 
buildings may be well worth the trouble it in- 
volves. In some of the larger cities, in which 
responsible adult groups may have the use of 
school assembly halls after school hours, hun- 
dreds of meetings, with an aggregate attendance 
running into large figures, are held annually. 
When the members of these audiences are cour- 
teously treated by those in charge of the buildings, 
89
-P-A-G-E-100
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
when they see the school structures clean, invit- 
ing, and attractive, their impressions are favor- 
able. Thus, public education sometimes can 
make large numbers of friends in unexpected 
quarters. 
Vv 
Nearty every school system prints an annual 
report which, in the large cities, often is a ponder- 
ous volume. The annual report was originally 
conceived as a means whereby the public should 
know how those in charge of the schools were 
carrying out their trust. To-day, in smaller 
communities, the annual report of the superin- 
tendent and other officials may fulfill its original 
purpose; but in larger places, unless it is compiled 
and edited with unusual discernment, it is of 
little or no value as a means of getting informa- 
tion to the taxpayers. 
The need for reform in the publication of an- 
nual reports and suggestions for getting the es- 
sence of them before the teaching corps and the 
public have been indicated in Chapter II. It 
may be said in general that the report should not 
be an omnibus whereon is loaded every fact and 
figure; on the contrary, it should interpret clearly, 
interestingly, and convincingly the outstanding 
phases of the work and problems of the schools.

Involved tabulations, consulted only by a few 
officials, should not be printed in the annual 
report; they should be typewritten or mimeo- 
graphed and kept where they are needed. Sta- 
tistical studies of fundamental importance prop- 
erly may form a part of the report, but these 
should be translated into graphs and the graphs 
clearly explained and interpreted. The rela- 
tionship of one set of facts or figures to another 
set should be made obvious whenever it is im- 
portant or striking enough to warrant the more 
specific explanation. 
To cite a simple example, one graph can show 
increase in city population, increase in school 
enrollment, and growth or lack of growth in 
school facilities during a given period of years. 
In connection with this there can be another 
graph showing the schools’ income during the 
past decade and the probable costs of mainte- 
nance and operation for a period of five or ten 
years to come. It can be indicated in the accom- 
panying explanation that, if the public desires 
the schools to continue to render the service they 
have been giving, and to accept the larger re- 
sponsibilities which should be met in the future, 
larger financial resources will be necessary.

other such statements as are ordinarily required 
by law must go into the report. In addition, 
much besides these can be part of the content. 
The annual report can be used to acquaint 
the school personnel with the more significant 
problems and phases of the system. In this 
sense it can contain worthy contributions to 
educational theory as well as valuable accounts 
of and suggestions for educational practice. 
VI 
In a large school system the variety of phases and 
interests of the educational undertaking is so 
great that it is difficult for the principals and 
teaching corps as well as for the public at large 
(including the newspapers) to obtain compre- 
hensive and adequate views of the more signifi- 
cant problems. The difficulty may be lessened 
by publishing monographs each of which can 
present some outstanding phase of the work of 
the schools. 
If the school system has a teachers’ house 
organ there is less need for monographs, though 
even where there is a house organ monographs 
may be read with interest and profit. Their cir- 
culation should be the same as that of the teach- 
ers’ house organ. (See Chapter II.)

MISCELLANEOUS POINTS OF CONTACT 
A number of subjects suggest the monograph 
method for their treatment; for example: the 
school housing problem; health education; rec- 
reation; community centers; vocational train- 
ing and guidance; moral and social guidance; 
intelligence testing; school finances; the project 
method; dramatization — games and plays; pro- 
fessional growth in the teaching corps; junior 
high schools; aims and methods in the teaching 
of music, art, geography, and other subjects. 
Every monograph should be written by the 
person in the system best prepared to present its 
subject fully and clearly. If the system has one 
employee in charge of all publications, he should 
edit the monographs to insure standardization 
in form and interest in method of presentation. 
Whenever expedient, monographs should contain 
illustrations — photographs, sketches, or graphs, 
as the need may be. 
The informational value of well-prepared 
monographs is high. Circulating among the 
teaching corps and among public-spirited citi- 
zens, legislators, members of civic organizations, 
and others who desire to be placed on the circu- 
lation list, their influence can be far-reaching. 
They make it possible for their readers to see the

the community. They contribute much toward 
larger understanding and coéperation within the 
school system as well as between the schools and 
the public. 
On rarer occasions small dodgers or folders or 
even monographs can be published to go directly 
to pupils or parents or both. If, for example, an 
epidemic of influenza threatens the community, 
the school medical department will be justified 
in printing a folder containing precautions which 
all pupils and parents should take to prevent the 
spread of the contagion. 
An example of a monograph for pupils and 
parents is to be seen in one descriptive of high- 
school education and its advantages which has 
been issued by the public schools of Cleveland. 
This booklet, which has as its title the phrase, 
“Give Yourself a Fair Start,” is- generously il- 
lustrated with photographs showing the high- 
school activities it describes. It emphasizes the 
value of a high-school education by printing the 
testimonials of many graduates who tell what 
and how a high-school education has contributed 
to their success and pleasure in life. The element 
of educational and vocational guidance has a 
prominent place in this booklet, for it aims to 
help the pupil readers to determine what type 
94

of high school to attend — academic, technical, 
or commercial. 
“Give Yourself a Fair Start” is presented to 
every pupil shortly before he is ready to enter 
high school. It is first read in class, the teacher 
leading in a discussion of what high school is and 
what it can do for one. The pupils then are 
asked to take the book home so that their parents 
may read it. In the introduction both parents 
and pupils are invited to call at any of the city’s 
high schools, to view their work, study their cur- 
ricula, and confer with the principals. 
This monograph, of which new and revised 
editions are frequently printed, has gone into 
thousands of homes. Besides assisting in the 
educational and vocational guidance of the pu- 
pils, it has incidentally given to parents an ac- 
curate and comprehensive view of the city’s 
public high schools. 
The publication of “Give Yourself a Fair 
Start” afforded an instance of one of those rare 
occasions on which it is expedient for the school 
authorities to ask the assistance of the daily news- 
papers. Every one of the city’s papers was re- 
quested to print an editorial stressing the value 
of a high-school education. Every paper was 
glad to grant the request. After the editorials 
95

had appeared in the newspapers, they were re- 
printed in “Give Yourself a Fair Start,” to the 
pronounced advantage of the booklet. 
VII 
Ir should be stated as a general principle that 
all monographs, reports, bulletins, and other 
printed matter published by a public school sys- 
tem should have as their outstanding objective 
the creation of a higher efficiency within the sys- 
tem. Any other objective must be incidental. 
Some school administrators have yielded to 
the temptation to make use of the printed word 
to obtain general publicity for the schools. In 
some cities bulletins or small newspapers are 
printed by the school system for this purpose 
and distributed to all parents. However high 
the motives of the schoolmen sponsoring such 
publications, this practice cannot be justified for 
reasons which already have been sufficiently em- 
phasized in this book. It is a form of direct 
publicity which, by its very nature, involves 
censorship, and invites suspicion. Unless the 
community definitely approves a school budget 
for advertising, it is exceedingly doubtful if the 
administration can justify expenditures of this 
nature.

WHAT IS NEWS? 
I 
THE press is the most important agency for the 
dissemination of ideas because it is universally 
read and because it deals with the raw materials 
of public opinion, performing a service indis- 
pensable in modern life. The public must de- 
pend upon the newspaper for a steady supply of 
that information upon which almost all action is 
based. 
For whom should one vote? At what price 
should one sell wheat? What theater should one 
attend? These are all questions the public has 
come to rely upon the newspaper to answer for it, 
either directly or indirectly. 
The newspaper, powerful engine as it is for 
the distribution of information, is open to edu- 
cation upon precisely the same terms as it is to 
every other human activity, but there are prin- 
ciples governing the publication of news that 
must be understood by those seeking its codpera- 
tion.

Waat is news? 
No definition has yet been written that meets 
the unqualified approval of all newspaper men. 
It is an elusive thing. What may be news to one 
man may not be news at all to another. 
One successful editor has attempted not only 
to define it, but to chart the problem of his as- 
sistants in these words: “News is what happens 
TO-DAY that interests me. The editor’s problem is 
to multiply mz by you and divide by the number 
of columns.” 
Accepting this definition for want of a better 
one, and analyzing it, we find that news is not 
merely information about a thing that has hap- 
pened, but that it must possess the elements of 
freshness and interest. Information, no matter 
how important it may be, is not news unless it 
is fresh and interesting. Important information 
often is, or may be made, interesting, but im- 
portance alone does not justify its publication as 
news. : 
The reporter trained or able to see the inter- 
esting in fresh information is said to have a “nose 
for news.” The school administrator will do well 
to study the methods of the newspaper that 
98
-P-A-G-E-109
  WHAT IS NEWS? 
he, too, may attain something of this news in- 
stinct. 
The demand for freshness, of course, makes 
news the most perishable of all commodities. 
Not even ice cream in August is more perishable. 
To-day’s news will not be news at all to-morrow; 
yesterday’s news is not news at all to-day. The 
constant repetition of the same facts, no matter 
how startling or novel they may have been 
originally, becomes routine. A military revolu- 
tion in England would be a matter of tremendous 
news interest, in some South American republics 
revolutions are routine news. The difference is 
that England has not had a military revolution 
in several hundred years, while in South America 
revolutions are of too frequent occurrence to be 
either novel or interesting. 
If news is perishable, it is also ephemeral. 
Newspaper men have a saying that even the 
most startling of news is no more than a nine 
days’ wonder, for interest in the most stupendous 
of events seldom survives that space of time. 
People who are much in the news find consolation 
in that fact; for if their good deeds, as recorded 
to-day, are forgotten to-morrow, their mistakes 
are not likely to survive much longer.

THE element of contest is one of the most im- 
portant in giving interest to news. Why this is so 
would afford a field for interesting study. Every 
editor knows that news which dramatizes the 
fact of contest is turned to eagerly by his readers, 
although often the point of contest is not itself a 
matter of grave consequence. 
It is the fact of contest that makes the sporting 
pages of American newspapers such lively read- 
ing. Baseball especially possesses the dramatic 
interest of contest, for there is not only the con- 
test of two teams for individual supremacy, but 
beyond that a greater one for league supremacy, 
and beyond that for national supremacy. 
Election news also possesses interest beyond 
questions of issues involved. There is the sport- 
ing interest in the “race” of opposing candi- 
dates. 
More than one statesman has deplored the 
fact that the public interest in politics extends 
little beyond election day, just as more than one 
university president has deplored the fact that 
his institution is seldom represented in the news- 
papers aside from the contests of the football 
team. 
100
-P-A-G-E-111
  WHAT IS NEWS? 
Theodore Roosevelt, whose utterances com- 
manded almost unlimited newspaper space, had 
the faculty of almost always dramatizing public 
questions in terms of conflict — the conflict of 
the “Ananias Club” and the truth-tellers, of the 
“malefactors of great wealth” against the com- 
mon man. 
Crime news, to some extent at least, enjoys its 
vogue by reason of the fact that it emphasizes 
contest: the contest of the murderer with his 
victim, of the fugitive with the pursuing police, 
and at last the conflict of the prisoner with the 
law courts. 
Similarly, a conflict of opinion among members 
of a board of education or among educators is 
better news than harmonious agreement, and the 
more bitter the conflict the more lively it is as 
news. This may be unfortunate, because mem- 
bers of a board of education may be in agree- 
ment upon every subject but one, yet the one 
subject of disagreement will be chosen by the 
newspapers for emphasis. It is news. 
IV 
Tue press is engaged in a highly competitive 
business, each newspaper striving to obtain a 
monopoly of the freshest news. If the news is,

  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL ' 
in fact, old, but suitable for publication becatise 
not previously published by any other paper, the 
news-writer strives to give it the appearance of 
freshness. 
For instance, if it has been decided to build a 
new school in a certain neighborhood of the city, 
and the newspaper decides the fact is news, it will 
begin its story not with the admission that the 
decision was reached a week ago, but will strive 
to make the news seem fresh by use of the time 
element, thus: 
A new elementary school is to be built in the 
Rosedale district, it became known TO-DAY. 
A rival newspaper, having been “scooped” 
on the story, would publish it only after it had 
disguised it so that it would appear new by the 
addition of facts the first paper had neglected to 
print. Its story would begin after this manner: 
Fifteen hundred pupils will be accommodated in 
a new school to be built in the Rosedale district, 
Superintendent W. J. Smith announced To-DAy. 
Often, of course, the “new angle” introduced 
constitutes but a thin disguise for old facts, but 
its use is dictated by newspaper conventions, 
Competition between morning and afternoon 
newspapers in the same city is no less keen if ona 
102
-P-A-G-E-113
| WHAT IS NEWS? 
different basis. A morning newspaper will not 
reprint news that has appeared the day before in 
its afternoon contemporary, unless the news can 
be made fresh by the addition of new facts of 
later development. Nor will an afternoon paper 
reprint news that has appeared in its morning 
contemporary unless that news can be freshened. 
For example, if the resignation of a popular 
high-school principal should be chronicled in the 
morning paper, the afternoon paper will mini- 
mize the news in a bare paragraph unless it can 
find a later development connected with the res- 
ignation that will, in effect, make it a new story. 
If the morning paper has announced: 
George A. Jones resigned yesterday as principal 
of Central High School 
—the afternoon paper will undertake to find 
sufficient facts to make a new story for itself. If 
it can obtain the name of Principal Jones’s suc- 
cessor it has an additional fact that creates a new 
story: 
John J. Black will succeed George A. Jones as 
principal of Central High School, according to an 
announcement made at school headquarters TO-DAY. 
Its story would be about Black and only in- 
cidentally about Jones. This is the technique of 
the “follow” story. 
103
-P-A-G-E-114
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
That the reporter must strive in this way to 
give the effect of freshness to his news is a fact 
that those having relations with the press should 
bear in mind. Whoever in the school system 
is charged with the responsibility of giving news 
to the reporters will do well to help the reporter 
find those facts which give freshness to it. And 
the facts when found must be interesting as well 
as fresh. 
Vv 
THERE are two general types of news stories. 
The principal and most important is the “straight 
news” story. The other is the “feature” or 
“human interest” story, incidental, of course, 
in the composition of a newspaper, but without 
which few papers would be very interesting. 
The straight news story aims at conveying in- 
formation. It conveys its information as briefly 
and as much to the point as possible. Good 
journalistic practice is to begin the straight news 
story with a “lead” or an introductory para- 
graph or two which present the essential news 
points in their order of interest or importance 
and at the same time serve to summarize the 
story. 
The following is such a lead: 
104
-P-A-G-E-115
  
  WHAT IS NEWS? 
A new elementary school, to cost $585,000, will be 
built in the congested Rosedale district of the city, 
the board of education decided at its meeting to-day. 
At the same time the board announced that its 
policy in the future would be to build no more addi- 
tions to buildings more than thirty years old, but to 
replace them with new buildings as rapidly as the 
work can be financed. 
Construction of the Rosedale school will begin 
within thirty days, Board President McCumber 
said. 
The story then goes on to relate in detail the 
discussion of the board leading up to its decision 
and to point out the probable consequences 
of the decision —its effects upon overcrowd- 
ing, etc. ; 
The “lead” is the cream skimmed off the news. 
It answers briefly and at once the questions in 
which the reader is interested — who? what? 
where? when? how? why? It is based upon the 
assumption that newspaper readers are busy, 
that they appreciate short cuts to the facts. 
It is not the province of the straight news 
story to indulge in matters of opinion, nor should 
it be a vehicle for the introduction of the report- 
er’s own ideas. Its essence is impersonal narra- 
tive. The editorial page alone is set aside for the 
expression of opinion. 
105  
-P-A-G-E-116
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
“Lead”’-writing is a trick of the trade, re- 
quiring an ability to see the news in a given 
story rather than unusual ability in writing. 
True, exceptional reporters, who become author- 
ities in any one field of news — such as national 
politics — often are permitted much wider lat- 
itude of expression, writing under their own 
names, the theory being that the news takes on a 
peculiar, interpretive value when seen through 
the personality of an expert observer. But this 
is a type of service which relatively few report- 
ers are privileged to perform, the great bulk of 
all newspaper work being done by anonymous 
persons who must not introduce» their own 
prejudices and their own philosophies into their 
work. They must remain colorless and impar- 
tial recorders of fact or of the opinions of others. 
In no other way, of course, can the stream of 
public information be made to flow unpolluted. 
The feature or “human interest” story is at 
the other extreme of the newspaper scale. It is 
as personal as the straight news story is imper- 
sonal, as colorful as the other is colorless. Its 
function is not to instruct, primarily, but to 
entertain. The writer must have the greatest 
freedom of expression. He must be free to de- 
velop any style he chooses and to adopt any 
106
-P-A-G-E-117
» WHAT IS NEWS? 
form suited to his story. The test of his product 
is, not “Is this important?” but “Does this en- 
tertain?” 
The material of a human interest story may 
be a thing of some importance or a thing of no 
importance. It may tell the story of two cats 
fighting on a back-yard fence, or of a neighbor- 
hood quarrel over a flock of chickens. In its 
modest way it is a work of art, and can be re- 
stricted no more than other forms of art. 
As the straight news story tells nothing about 
persons beyond the self-evident and incontro- 
vertible facts, the human interest story tells 
enough about them to make them seem “human” 
— how they speak, how they act, how they think. 
Its interest is that of the emotions, of the heart, 
the human interest — the interest in warm, liv- 
ing, breathing men and women, boys and girls, 
cats and dogs. 
The style of different feature stories may vary 
widely. One writer may choose short, crisp 
sentences. Another may affect the style of the 
straight news-writer. A third may use the form 
of magazine fiction. The facts to be related often 
suggest the appropriate style. 
The following is introduced as an illustration 
of this type: 
107

  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
(New York Times Wire) 
New York, June 17 — Peter Hanrahan is a cop 
and doesn’t pretend to be a scholar. So when a seedy 
gentleman of the road, whom he awoke from slumber 
on a bench in Riverside Drive early to-day, admitted 
that he was Geoffrey Chaucer, Peter wrote it down 
without hesitation. 
“And where might you have ever lived?” con- 
tinued Peter, intent upon filling out the regulation 
form. 
“Oh, Canterbury,” replied Geoffrey. 
“New York State?” asked Peter. 
“No, it’s not in this country.” Then with a 
quizzical glance at the bluecoat’s Hibernian cast of 
countenance, Geoffrey added: “It’s a suburb of 
Dublin.” 
“Your occupation?” 
“Sir?” came the indignant response. 
“Well, what have you ever accidentally done in 
the way of work?” 
“T once was a writer, something of a poet.” 
“No wonder you’re a bum,” said Hanrahan, 
snapping his notebook shut. ‘Come along.” 
It was not until three hours later in court that 
Officer Peter Hanrahan got a lesson in literature. 
The clerk droned the formula charging Geoffrey 
Chaucer, poet of Canterbury, with vagrancy. The 
magistrate stuffed his handkerchief over his mouth 
and took a fit of coughing. 
108
-P-A-G-E-119
WHAT IS NEWS? 
“Didn’t you ever hear of Geoffrey Chaucer, of 
Canterbury, before?” he finally asked Hanrahan. 
“No, your honor,” replied Hanrahan. “This is 
the first time he has been arrested. I looked up the 
records.” 
The bench shook with the next spasm of his honor. 
When he recovered from this, he gravely addressed 
the prisoner: 
“Mr. Chaucer,” he said, “I know you by no other 
name. I am accustomed to various and sundry 
aliases and alibis, but yours is the best I ever heard. 
Your reward is your freedom. You may go with my 
gratitude for another tale from Canterbury.” 
Then, to the puzzled policeman, the judge spoke 
kindly: 
“Hereafter, Hanrahan, consult the public library 
when you pinch a poet.” 
Here are facts of no material consequence. 
They do not affect the price of wheat nor the 
welfare of the country. Stated as colorless facts 
(for example, “A tramp arrested in Riverside 
Drive this morning gave his name as Geoffrey 
Chaucer’), the item would have been too lacking 
in interest to justify any expenditure for tele- 
graph tolls for its distribution about the country. 
Its merit resides in the art with which it is 
written. Its interest lies in its revelation of the 
personalities of the policeman, the whimsical 
109
-P-A-G-E-120
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
tramp, and the good-natured judge. And, fol- 
lowing the lines of art generally, the story reveals 
those personalities by indirection and suggestion. 
A school system is an unlimited source of fea- 
ture stories. A reporter with imagination and 
sufficient time for the work can find in school 
projects and school activities of all kinds ma- 
terial lending itself to this mode of treatment. 
Such stories are sketchy and slight, but often 
they reveal the educational philosophy underlying 
the schools and interpret modern education to 
the public. 
VI 
EFFECTIVE codperation between the press and 
the schools often has been made impossible by 
the very personality of the educator. Usually 
he has been trained in the classroom where his 
work has escaped public attention, either of 
commendation or criticism. That he should 
continue in his labors, self-effacing, cloistered, 
undisturbed by what he thinks of as “newspaper 
notoriety,” he accepts as the natural order of 
things. 
The fact is that most effective newspaper 
publicity hinges upon personality, rather than 
upon inanimate things, methods, and systems, 
110
-P-A-G-E-121
  
WHAT IS NEWS? 
and the educator wishing the codperation of the 
press must be willing to have his opinions and 
his philosophy, even his personality, reflected to 
the public. The publicis more willing to support 
individuals than it is ideas, except as it trusts the 
ideas of the persons who have won its confidence. 
The educator is entrusted with the expendi- 
ture of public revenues which may amount to 
millions of dollars annually, and he must expect 
to be held as completely accountable as is the 
mayor or the councilman. He cannot escape 
criticism and, if his work is being done intelli- 
gently, he should welcome the limelight. 
In justification of his own timidity, the edu- 
cator brings certain charges against the press. 
They arc: 
1. The newspaper is studiously inaccurate. 
2. The newspaper distorts. 
3- It prints too much crime news, preferring 
the low and the trivial to the high and the 
important. 
Unfortunately, there is much ground for 
these charges. The newspaper aiming at mass 
circulation is of necessity far from perfect. But 
often specific charges of distortion or inaccuracy 
fail to take account of all the conditions under 
which newspapers are printed.

Newspaper editors, at least, believe that they 
are publishing the kinds of newspapers which 
their own particular readers want, since to sell as 
many copies as possible is the very life of the 
industry. 
But, it may be objected, the press itself cor- 
rupts its readers so that they prefer the low and 
the trivial rather than the high and the impor- 
tant. Whether the press corrupts the public or 
the public the press is a problem as vexing and as 
incapable of solution as whether the hen first 
laid the egg or the egg first hatched the chicken. 
Both views may have in them elements of truth 
without in the least altering the facts of the situa- 
tion as it exists. 
Modern newspaper equipment is expensive. 
A metropolitan newspaper plant represents a 
capital investment of millions. Its payroll may 
total other millions annually. Its expenditure 
for print paper alone may range as high as ten 
millions a year. Obviously, then, if it is to meet 
the payroll and operating expenses, the news- 
paper must be a business institution. And this 
sets the newspaper entirely aside from the public 
schools or the public library as a moulder of 
public opinion. 
The school system is a public undertaking 
112 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
    WHAT IS NEWS? 
with no obligation whatever of paying its way, 
except by means of its contribution to society. 
The newspaper is a private undertaking obliged 
to make money. 
There are all sorts of people in the world. 
There are a few with very high ideals whose 
primary tastes are expressed in literature, art, 
and music; there are some not quite so high in 
the scale to whom these tastes are of secondary 
importance, and there are many entirely without 
them. 
Every educator knows that this is true. He 
knows the great majority of his pupils have not 
the native endowments to become poets or phi- 
losophers, and that they are destined for useful 
lives as handcraftsmen. Manual training is the 
way of education for some, Latin and Greek for 
others. 
Perhaps this stratification of society may 
eventually be altered, although it must be con- 
fessed that educators who have been trying to 
alter it seem to have made but little progress. 
The hope that they may succeed better in the 
future does not alter the facts as they exist in 
the United States to-day. 
The editor who consciously appeals to the very 
highest tastes and noblest aspirations of the few, 
113
-P-A-G-E-124
PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
rather than to the baser tastes of the many, will 
fill his columns only with the most important of 
political, economic, sociological news, placing 
much emphasis upon all the arts, education, and 
religion. How many readers in any given com- 
munity can he hope to attract? 
Many, perhaps, in a city as populous as New 
York, few in Spokane. The Springfield Repub- 
lican once maintained itself upon a very high 
intellectual plane, but by virtue of appealing 
to a national audience rather than to its own 
local constituency. Many more persons pre- 
fer the Saturday Evening Post to the Atlantic 
Monthly; many more prefer Harold Bell Wright 
to George Meredith; many more prefer the New 
York Journal to its more scholarly contempo- 
rary, the Evening Post. 
The editor broadens his appeal to attract a 
larger group of readers. He places less emphasis 
upon the head and more upon the heart. That 
community is happy, indeed, whose newspapers 
find it possible to combine the two — to carry an 
influence for good both to the mass and to the 
class. But in any event, struggle for survival 
under highly competitive conditions has made 
the newspaper largely what it is. And survival 
means quantity circulation.

THe newspaper has for sale two commodities 
and only two—news and advertising space. 
The public, although wishing to be informed, 
has never been willing to pay the cost of gather- 
ing and publishing news. The two or three cents 
you pay for your daily paper represent but a 
fraction of the cost. The ordinary American 
will pay ten cents for a drink at the soda fountain 
with the utmost complaisance, but he would ob- 
ject most strenuously to paying a dime for all the 
news of the world. 
Yet, for two or three cents, as Walter Lipp- 
mann points out, he expects newspaper reporters 
and correspondents to penetrate the heart of the 
desert and to brave the perils of the deep that he 
may have immediately for his instruction and 
entertainment those facts of the world that in- 
terest him. 
From the newspaper he expects the lofty 
idealism of the church, the entertainment of the 
vaudeville, and the instruction of the school. 
Willingly he will tax himself to support his 
church, his school, and the theater, but he is not 
yet prepared to pay the cost of gathering news. 
‘Consequently the newspaper cannot exist

except by selling a by-product — advertising. 
Eventually the public must pay for the advertis- 
ing over the counters of the merchant, but it is far 
more willing to be taxed indirectly than directly. 
The publisher’s problem, therefore, is to attract 
so many readers that advertisers will find it prof- 
itable to appeal to them through his columns. 
Contrary to an opinion common among some 
critics, the editor is much more concerned with 
pleasing his readers than in pleasing his adver- 
tisers. He is more responsive to the records of 
the circulation manager than to the books of the 
advertising department. He knows that, if he 
can get the readers, the advertisers will come as a 
matter of course. Without readers he can have 
no advertising, and the impression that editorial 
policy is influenced by the advertiser in any 
marked degree is erroneous, at least so far as 
the more important newspapers are concerned. 
The editor, like the schoolman, may be sensitive 
to the social implications of his work, but, unlike 
the schoolman, he must himself find the means 
for the payment of his salary. 
VoOI 
Tue editor must be understood as a dual per- 
sonality. As a professional man he has a defi-

nite responsibility to society. Asa business man ~ 
he has no less definite responsibility to his em- 
ployers. He must lead the people wisely and to 
higher levels. At the same time he must make 
money. And to expect the editor to exclude the 
interesting to accommodate the dully important 
is to ask of him a greater sacrifice than that which 
is expected of any other business man. 
As between an obscure but important political 
situation in the Near East and the elopement of 
a popular moving-picture actress, every editor 
knows instinctively to which his readers will 
turn most eagerly. 
That the newspaper should exclude all crime 
news is another thesis to which many educators 
hold. Yet a little reflection will show what evils 
such censorship would invite. Crime is an ac- 
tuality, unhappily, and no newspaper is fulfilling 
its fundamental obligation to tell the moving 
story of life if it ignores it. That crime may be 
exaggerated beyond the confines of good taste is 
admitted, but the editor who takes upon him- 
self to say what his readers shall know or not know 
in one realm of news is inviting himself into the 
further temptation to censor all news. If he can 
delete crime news not to his taste, why not also de- 
lete political or educational news not to his taste?

Ir the school would share in the picture of life 
which the newspaper paints from day to day, 
educators must expect that its interesting activ- 
ities will be emphasized at the expense of what 
some teachers may feel to be the more important. 
The essence of good publicity is to see that the 
interesting story also contains information of 
importance made interesting. If a certain class 
in school, pursuing the project method, should 
buy a flock of chickens and undertake to produce 
eggs for the school lunch-room, that fact would 
make a story certain to interest the ordinary 
reader. And at the same time it can be made 
the vehicle for explaining the educational im- 
plications of the project method. Teachers and 
school administrators have some obligation here 
to see that the reporter sees in the simple story of 
the children and their hens the educational phi- 
losophy back of it. 
That the picture of any school system which 
the newspaper can present will be piecemeal, in- 
constant, and incomplete is, of course, obvious. 
Not one story, but a constant succession of 
stories, will turn the tide of public confidence 
toward the schools.

  WHAT IS NEWS? 
Public sympathy for an institution cannot be 
built overnight. It is spun upon the slender 
threads of many stories, any one of which may be 
of little importance, but which together make a 
cable of surprising strength. 
Assuming that a school system is honestly and 
intelligently administered, it cannot help but 
profit from all the publicity which the news- 
papers may see fit to give it.

Tue school administrator, if he expects the fullest 
codperation on the part of the press, must open 
his school system to complete inspection on the 
part.of-newspaper.men. 
No reporter will be content merely to call on 
the superintendent and his assistants and publish 
those things which these executives may consider 
it proper for the public to know. He will wish 
to visit the schools and inquire first-hand into 
their activities, and it is in the schools themselves 
that he will find news of the greatest interest. 
At headquarters he gets theory; in the field he 
gets practice; for such information as the admin- 
istrator can give out will, of necessity, be pretty 
much restricted to the administrative side of the 
system and to matters of general policy; but in 
the school buildings may be seen how the policies 
of the headquarters experts are working out. 
Moreover, the parent, who must be visualized 
as the newspaper consumer, is far more interested 
120  
-P-A-G-E-131
  “CONTACT OF SCHOOL AND PRESS 
in the activities in which his child is engaged than 
in the fine-spun theories of the experts. How 
does Willie spend his time at school? In what 
projects is he engaged? How are such subjects 
as geography and history taught differently to 
Willie than they were taught to Willie’s father 
twenty years before? These are matters in 
which the parent is interested, for they have to 
do with the immediate welfare and the probable 
future of his child. 
One of the most popular series of school stories 
printed in one large city in recent years com- 
prised the accounts written by a reporter who 
went into the school room to see education from 
the pupil viewpoint. For one day he sat in the 
kindergarten as a pupil. The next day he spent 
as a first grade pupil; and thus through every 
grade he experienced and wrote about the many 
interesting processes in modern education. 
II 
FAR-SIGHTED newspaper men are coming more 
and more to see the necessity of interesting 
children in their papers. The reason for this is 
that since the newspaper is a permanent institu- 
tion it will need readers just as much to-morrow 
and next year as it does to-day. The children 
121
-P-A-G-E-132
  
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
of to-day will be the newspaper readers and the 
newspaper advertisers of to-morrow, and if the 
editor can engage and hold their interest, there is 
a strong possibility that they will not desert his 
paper when they have grown to manhood and 
womanhood. 
Use of the daily bedtime story is the entering 
wedge to the interests of the child, which the 
newspaper strives to develop in the later years 
with news about Boy Scout and Camp Fire Girl 
activities. Radio news, making an appeal to 
boyish amateurs, also serves this purpose. 
This desire on the part of newspaper men to 
enlist the interests of children is one which the 
school administrator can turn to good account. 
Already many newspapers are publishing special 
departments devoted to school news; one metro- 
politan paper conducts in December each year a 
Christmas story-writing contest open to junior 
and senior high-school pupils; another offers 
prizes in a poster or illustration contest; others 
give medals to high-school athletes. 
The schools can share, if only incidentally, in 
publicity attending such enterprises as these, 
but often the purely incidental mention of the 
schools is of more value from a publicity stand- 
point than would be a special article written ex- 
122
-P-A-G-E-133
  
CONTACT OF SCHOOL AND PRESS 
pressly to emphasize the good qualities of the 
schools. 
Newspaper men will generally welcome sug- 
gestions from school people of still other methods 
of codperation, especially if the ideas suggested 
hold the promise of interesting children in their 
newspapers. 
The importance of the contest element in the 
composition vf news has already been pointed 
out (Chapter V, Section 3). School executives 
can make use of it in a variety of ways to develop 
news that will be beneficial to the cause of educa- 
tion. ; 
The most simple example of the contest ele- 
ment as it affects news may be found on the 
sporting pages in reports of baseball and football 
games between pupils of different schools, and in 
competitions among pupils for prizes in story 
and essay writing. But there are many other 
features of educational activity in which the in- 
jection of the contest element will give news a 
more dramatic appeal. 
It may be a contest between progress and re- 
action, between nature and man, between truth 
and ignorance. 
A campaign by school health authorities 
against measles can be dramatized in terms ot 
123 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
such a contest. Different schools may compete 
for the distinction of having the fewest number 
of cases in any given week. 
A boy handicapped by extreme poverty or by 
physical infirmity who wins distinction in scholar- 
ship is a “story” every newspaper man recog- 
nizes. A poor girl who works her way through 
school and at the same time helps to support her 
family has won in a struggle against adversity 
and becomes a “story.” 
Contrasts, if sufficiently striking, also are 
sources of news. A great deal of school news un- 
wittingly has this element of contrast, serving to 
compare the methods and aims of the school of 
twenty or thirty years ago with the school of 
to-day. Most parents of to-day attended school 
at least twenty years ago, and they are usually 
impressed to learn of newer ideas in education. 
School attendance in America is a common ex- 
perience, and every one has a basis for compari- 
ison and criticism. 
Superlative things make news. The largest 
thing, the smallest, the brightest pupil, the clean- 
est building, the prettiest teacher, the best- 
natured janitor — these are all news possibil- 
ities. 
The project method offers a large field for good

CONTACT OF SCHOOL AND PRESS 
human interest stories to the wide-awake re- 
porter, because the project method is sufficiently 
new to be news, and because the variety of its 
material is almost infinite. Stories dealing with 
specific projects in which the activities of various 
classes are correlated set forth the work of educa- 
tion in one of its most striking modern aspects. 
Stories that can be illustrated by striking 
photographs are almost always in demand. 
It may be objected that the publication of such 
news will have little publicity value, but school 
administrators could make no greater mistake 
than to suppose that every article dealing with 
education must be laudatory in character if it is 
to serve a useful purpose. 
The truth is that all school news helps to ex- 
plain education, bit by bit, and even the frankly 
critical may at times be helpful. The purpose of 
publicity is to build confidence in the schools, 
and even the slightest of stories may serve this 
purpose. 
I 
Ir is not amiss in this particular place to call at- 
tention to what is good newspaper art (that is, 
photographs) and what is not so good. 
The larger newspapers have their own staff 
125
-P-A-G-E-136

PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
photographers, working on assignment from the 
city editor, whose business it is to bring into the 
office interesting photographs, just as it is the 
business of the reporter to bring in good and en- 
tertaining stories. 
The demand of every city editor is for “action” 
pictures as opposed to “‘stills.” An action pic- 
ture is one which portrays or suggests action. A 
still picture is one that is especially posed, or 
which conveys the impression that it has been 
posed. As a matter of fact many good action 
pictures, as well as the “stills,” are posed, but 
they are posed in such a way as to indicate ac- 
tion. 
A picture of a baseball player in the act of 
pitching a ball, with his arm extended and the 
ball just leaving or about to leave his hand, is 
such an action picture. If the same ball player 
stood, facing the camera, with his arms folded, it 
would obviously be a posed, or a “‘still” picture. 
Now, the advantage of the action over the 
still photograph is that it is something more than 
a mere picture. It tells a story in its own right. 
In the example of the ball player pitching the 
ball, the story is that he is throwing a runner out 
at first, or pitching to the batter, and the mere 
posture of the player, without accompanying ex- 
126 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  
CONTACT OF SCHOOL AND PRESS 
planation, suggests to the imagination the con- 
sequence of the throw. 
Much of the material which the schools have 
to offer the newspaper photographer is of the still 
variety, but even these “‘stills” can be enlivened 
and turned into action pictures by the expedient 
of photographing along with them teachers or 
children in postures suggesting action. 
For example, a boy has modeled a medizval 
castle in clay as a part of a school project. A 
photograph of the castle alone might serve the 
purpose of interpreting a phase of school work, 
but it would not awaken the interest of the 
reader to the extent it would if the boy, in the act 
of putting the finishing touches to his clay model, 
were photographed with it. 
In one case you have seen the boy’s finished 
product, but in the other you have seen not only 
his finished product, but something of the process 
by which it was achieved. In addition, the pres- 
ence of the boy in the picture gives an impression 
of comparative dimensions. How large is the 
castle? Photographed alone it would be im- 
possible to determine, but when the boy is added 
to the picture the dimensions become self-evident. 
Recently a big city newspaper declined to 
print the photograph of what was said to have 
127
-P-A-G-E-138
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
been the largest frog ever captured, for the 
simple reason that the frog was photographed 
alone, with nothing in it to tell the story of com- 
parative size. The reader could not have de- 
termined, by looking at the picture, whether the 
frog was six inches long, or six feet. The picture 
could have been saved and turned into an inter- 
esting and instructive illustration if the frog had 
been held in a man’s hands or placed on the seat 
of an ordinary dining-room chair when the pho- 
tograph was taken. 
The fact that newspapers are eager to obtain 
photographs of pretty women and girls, rather 
than pictures of men, may appeal to teachers as 
another indication of the depravity of the press. 
It is a fact that the ordinary city editor much 
prefers to publish the photograph of a pretty 
girl, no matter how empty-headed she may be, 
than the photograph of the most distinguished 
man. He knows that the picture of the pretty 
girl will add a decorative note to his newspaper, 
and that his readers, both men and women, will 
be far more entertained by it than by the picture 
of any man. 
Whether the appeal is made frankly to sex in- 
terest, or whether it may be attributed to some- 
thing higher, is matter for the psychologist. The 
128
-P-A-G-E-139
CONTACT OF SCHOOL AND PRESS 
preference exists with the newspaper editor be- 
cause he believes it exists among his readers, and 
since it is not the immediate province of the 
educator to reform the press, he had best recog- 
nize the fact. 
This means that when the photographer goes. 
into the schools looking for material he will be 
more interested in taking pictures of pretty high- 
school girls than pictures of homely boys. 
Next to pretty girls, perhaps, small children 
of either sex make the strongest appeal to the 
photographer. The interest in small children 
probably may be attributed to the protective or 
parental instinct. Every one is either a parent 
or may become one, and few persons are totally 
indifferent to the appeal of innocence or help- 
lessness made by little shavers of five, six, or 
seven years. 
The practice of different newspapers in the use 
of photographs varies, of course, with the per- 
sonalities, intelligence, or theories of different 
editors. Nearly all newspapers use illustrations 
because they help to relieve the dull appearance 
of otherwise unbroken pages of solid type. 
Some editors prefer pictures that are merely 
decorative, “‘prettiness” in the photograph being 
the basis of selection. Others care little for 
129 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
decorative effect, but insist upon the element 
of illustration. They expect the pictures they 
print to tell a story equally as well as printed 
matter occupying the same space could do. Still 
others seek a combination of decoration and il- 
lustration. 
IV 
How shall the reporter and the photographer be 
received when they arrive at a school building? 
They should be made just as welcome as any 
other visitors would be, and they should be as- 
sisted to do their work with the greatest possible 
expedition. This does not mean that the princi- 
pal and the teachers should fawn upon them, but 
it does mean that they should not place obstacles 
in their way. 
Here again it is essential to remember that the 
reporter is, in a very real sense, the unofficial 
representative of the public, and if the public is 
to be impressed with the fact that the schools are 
open and aboveboard and entitled to codperation, 
the reporter must first be impressed. 
Every principal and teacher should be given to 
understand that they have the most complete 
authority to talk freely with reporters and that 
it is not necessary for them to telephone head- 
130
-P-A-G-E-141
CONTACT OF SCHOOL AND PRESS 
quarters for specific instructions every time a 
newspaper man arrives. Reticence in answering 
the questions of the reporter naturally will sug- 
gest to him some reason for trying to conceal the 
facts, even though there is no reason for conceal- 
ment. 
So the reporter should be assisted to do his 
work expeditiously, and he should not be kept 
waiting to suit the convenience of the principal, 
or that he may be properly “impressed” with 
the importance and dignity of that official. The 
principal also must remember that news is per- 
ishable, and that time is the thing of utmost 
importance in the publication of news. 
A newspaper photographer in his work may 
upset for a few minutes the routine of a class, but 
both the teacher and the principal will do well to 
bear with the interruption. 
The principal must be made to feel by his 
superiors that he is genuinely free to talk to the 
newspaper man, or to any one else, about his 
work, and the effect will be twofold. First, the 
appreciation of the newspaper man and hence of 
the public will be enhanced; and, second, the 
respect of the principal for the fairness and 
democracy of the controlling officials will be 
firmly implanted.

THESE are all small things, but in no other field 
than school publicity is it so true that if you 
would look after the big things you must first 
look to the small ones. 
The picture of life is a shifting picture, and a 
correct understanding and appreciation of the 
picture of education must be predicated upon a 
great number of small parts, themselves correctly 
‘understood and appreciated by the individual, 
who subconsciously fits them all together to 
make up his own completed picture. 
Boards of education issue annual reports cov- 
ering the activities of the schools, dealing in de- 
tail with school finances, building projects, and 
matters of educational policy, but few of these 
reports are designed for wide circulation, and 
even if a copy could be placed in every home it 
may be doubted if they would either be read or. 
understood. 
A simple picture of Willie and his clay castle 
must interpret modern education to the ordinary 
newspaper reader. If the clay castle project 
132

appeals to him as fundamentally sound, he will 
go on to the conclusion that the schools are sound 
as a whole. This may seem, at first, illogical, 
but a little reflection will illustrate that even 
educators are not much different in their own 
reactions. 
What, for instance, is your opinion of the avail- 
ability of any candidate for the presidency? 
You are convinced that he is a good (or bad) 
candidate, not because you have been able to 
judge him through personal contact, but because 
of a large number of things you have read about 
him. You might have difficulty in recalling any 
definite thing read. You merely know that the 
sum total of all your impressions is such that 
you are convinced of his fitness (or unfitness) for 
office. 
Imagination is the strongest of mental qual- 
ities and the most active, always engaged in 
making conclusions about the unknown on the 
basis of the known. 
Ponderous articles dealing with education in 
the abstract will not be read by large masses of 
people, no matter how admirable they may be. 
So there, until the level of popular intelligence is 
greatly raised, is an end of the matter. 
133

In the long run education cannot be a sound 
structure in a democracy unless it rests upon a 
broad base of popular understanding and ap- 
proval. If the public is skeptical of the educa- 
tor’s aims and doubtful of his methods, it will, 
late or soon, topple his house to its foundation. 
If he would build to last out the years, he must 
build with the consent and support of the cit- 
izenry. 
No educator, standing alone, can withstand 
for long popular clamor for the inclusion of this 
or that in the curriculum. But whence comes 
the popular clamor? It grows either out of the 
wisdom or the folly of the mass, and whether the 
mass is wise or ignorant respecting education 
depends upon how well the educator has done his 
work of interpreting education to it in terms 
which the mass can understand. 
Shot through the theory of education is the 
faith that it can and will work to effect changes 
in people. Prophets of woe who see the race 
foredoomed to decadence have no place in educa- 
tion, for it is the very expression of mankind’s 
highest hope for the future. 
This, then, is the business of education: To

build citizens for the future capable and willing 
to contribute to the race the utmost of their en- 
dowments, whether of skill or art; and to build 
such a popular foundation for the task that the 
people as a whole will foster and sustain it. 
The educator cannot live unto himself alone. 
He must enlist tHe taxpayer’s support by every 
legitimate means, that he may be protected in 
his work and that the children entrusted to his 
care may be protected in their heritage. 
This is the justification for the open-door 
policy in school publicity, far outweighing in 
consequence the petty annoyances and interrup- 
tions to which school official or teacher may be 
subjected by the “‘intrusion” of newspaper men.

STUDENT PUBLICATIONS

Tue high-school newspaper, prepared by a stu- 
dent staff, has, in addition to its large educa- 
tional merit, important possibilities for helpful 
school publicity. 
When the school paper is a creditable reflec- 
tion of the activities, aims, and spirit of the 
school, it makes the school known unto itself, 
thus fostering understanding and harmonious 
coéperation among all departments and groups. 
Carried by the pupils into their homes, it comes, 
though casually and incidentally, under the eyes 
of fathers and mothers to bring to them an. at- 
~ tractive and accurate mirroring of school ideals 
and accomplishments. 
The publicity value in the school paper lies in 
an honest, unaffected mirroring of the school ac- 
tivities and spirit by the pupils themselves. 
When the paper becomes a propaganda sheet 
of the school authorities, its popularity and cir- 
culation will dwindle, automatically defeating 
136  
-P-A-G-E-147

the purpose of the propaganda. If the publica- 
tion is such that every pupil will want it for read- 
ing and for saving, its influence as a medium of 
constructive publicity follows naturally. 
I 
EDUCATIONALLY, the well-conducted school 
newspaper is of unquestioned value. It can be 
to the teaching of English what the chemical 
laboratory is to the teaching of chemistry. 
More than this, when a student writes for his 
school paper he knows that what he writes, if it 
is well done, will serve a definite purpose; he 
knows that, unlike so many formal themes, its 
ultimate destination will not be the waste- 
basket. Success in life, after all, is largely 
dependent on one’s power to influence other 
persons. Development of the ability to write 
effectively is no small contribution to one’s 
success — in school and out of school. 
The student writing for the school paper learns 
to carry responsibility. In preparing an accept- 
able article for the paper, he must understand 
the different aspects of the situation which his 
article is to set forth; he must present interest- 
‘ingly and accurately the salient facts involved. 
In obtaining the facts on which his story is to be 
137

  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
built, he may have to interview many persons, 
some of them strangers to him. Interview- 
ing develops poise, adaptability, understanding, 
sympathy; and it affords excellent training in 
oral English. 
The student reporter must be accurate. What 
he writes becomes public information for the 
entire school. He soon learns that quick and 
painful reactions follow inaccuracy. 
In building a desired school morale the student 
newspaper is of extreme importance. It can 
sponsor every good student movement. It can 
do for a school what a good newspaper can do for 
a city. It can build that unity without which 
worthy activities, requiring common understand- 
ing and common action, cannot flourish. 
As the conscientious reporter or editor on a 
city newspaper can serve the cause of civic 
progress and righteousness by his thoughtful and 
fair-minded handling of news stories, so the 
student writer on the school newspaper can serve 
his school. All of this involves character devel- 
opment as well as mental training. 
There are definite advantages for the pupils on 
the business staff of the school publication. Here 
again it serves as a laboratory for practical train- 
ing. Business managership, advertising, sales-

manship, circulation, accounting, bookkeeping, 
banking —in all of these the business staff 
members receive experience leading to useful 
knowledge and good habits. 
Tt 
Or the many correlations involved in the school 
paper project one deserves special emphasis — 
the study of newspaper methods and ethics. 
The capable teacher of newswriting and journal- 
ism will see that the emphasis is given. 
Newton D. Baker has advocated that the 
public schools set up a course to train children 
how to read newspapers so that they may be bet- 
ter able, as newspaper readers, to discriminate 
between the true and the false, between half 
truth and whole truth, between opinion and fact. 
Professor James Harvey Robinson, in his 
Mind in the Making, has written much that sug- 
gests the same thing, and has indicated the 
mental processes and the criteria involved in the 
forming of opinion. The printed word can ex- 
press half truth and falsehood as well as the 
whole truth. Intelligent discrimination is re- 
quired on the part of the reader if there is to 
be correct evaluation of the editorial and news 
matter published in our daily papers.

PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
Inasmuch as the press, more than any other 
agency, is directly and indirectly responsible for 
forming the public opinion which determines 
progress or lack of progress in government, educa- 
tion, religion, economic and social organization, 
it is important that the most intelligent group 
in every community of the Nation, the group 
comprised of high-school and college graduates, 
should possess the power of discrimination and 
independent judgment. 
Surely, it should be the duty of educators, if 
they wish to build for a better community and 
a better world, to give to the children that sort 
of education which makes for straight thinking, 
discrimination, and fair judgment. The course 
in English, with its emphasis upon the classics, 
makes for these qualities in the field of literature. 
It is no less important that similar means of 
evaluation be applied to those writings in the 
daily press on which the masses of us form our 
opinions. 
Study of the daily press, conducted under the 
guidance of the trained journalism teacher, can 
| be as valuable as any activity in the curriculum. 
The results obtained from it, moreover, can show 
in the school newspaper which, having a group of 
readers higher in native intelligence than those 
140  
-P-A-G-E-151
  STUDENT PUBLICATIONS 
of the usual daily newspaper, is in a position to 
set higher standards in news and editorial matter 
than the daily can follow without running into 
danger of commercial failure. Thus the taste 
and desire for a better type of newspaper can be 
cultivated in every high school in America. 
The educators of the Nation occupy the key 
position for creating a great group of readers 
among whom the trivial, the salacious, and the 
sensational will be regarded as offensive and 
harmful. High-minded newspaper workers — 
and they are just as numerous, proportionately, 
as high-minded educators — will rejoice in the 
growth of such a group. Their delight will be 
akin to that of the teacher who has pupils men- 
tally alert, morally sound, eager and responsive 
after having had a class in which the dull and 
unresponsive predominated. 
It is interesting and enlightening to try to 
visualize the effect on America during the next 
generation if every high school in the Nation set 
itself to the task of trying to have every graduate 
a discriminating reader of the public press. 
IV 
Ir should be evident from the foregoing that the 
theory and practice in newswriting and journal- 
141
-P-A-G-E-152
| PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
ism obtained in the high-school paper project are 
not primarily vocational in purpose. Of a group 
of thirty young persons on the staff of the school 
paper, it may be that but two or three at most 
will enter upon journalism as a means of liveli- 
hood. The vocational aspect is but incidental. 
It is true that experience gained on a high-school 
paper, under a capable teacher of newswriting, is 
of distinct help to any young person who, after 
graduation, obtains employment on the staff of a 
daily newspaper. Not infrequently it happens 
that a pupil, through service on the school paper, 
discovers he has a marked aptitude and liking 
for newspaper work and shapes his course then 
and there to enter the field of his choice. 
To the majority of pupils on the staff, the ex- 
perience is vocational in the sense in which the 
school itself is vocational. It gives ever-increas- 
ing contacts with the thoughts and achieve- 
ments of others and so helps pupils to find them- 
selves. 
This phase of newspaper work, whether in 
school or on a city daily, is worth the attention 
of the vocational guidance people. If a survey | 
were to be made of men and women prominent in | 
public life, law, finance, and business, it would be 
discovered that not an inconsiderable number of 
142
-P-A-G-E-153
  STUDENT PUBLICATIONS 
them formerly were newspaper reporters or edi- 
tors. Probably most of them liked newspaper 
work well enough; but through it, as a result of 
the innumerable contacts it affords with interests 
and problems in other fields, they discovered 
something they liked better. 
The high-school newspaper gives to those 
pupils on its staff, and to its readers, also, to a 
less degree, contacts with school activities which 
otherwise they might not have. Through these 
their perspectives of ‘education and of life may 
undergo changes of far-reaching importance. 
Vv 
PUBLISHING a newspaper, even a high-school 
newspaper, is an undertaking requiring special- 
ized training, pronounced ability, and intricate 
knowledge of technique. 
To expect high-school or junior high-school 
students to get out a creditable school publica- 
tion without the training, guidance, and direc- 
tion of a capable teacher of newswriting and 
journalism is quite analogous to expecting them 
to perform creditably in Latin, algebra, chem- 
istry, or shop course without teachers trained 
in those subjects. It is similar to expecting a 
school football team, composed of green players, 
143
-P-A-G-E-154
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
to develop into a winning team without the serv- 
ices of a good coach. 
Ordinarily a high-school paper has two faculty 
advisers; one with knowledge of business meth- 
ods to watch over the financial matters, and a 
teacher from the English department to super- 
vise the editorial staff. 
The business adviser, lacking practical experi- 
ence on the business side of a daily newspaper, is 
not seriously handicapped if he has good general 
knowledge of business practices. But the edi- 
__ torial adviser should be a teacher of newswriting 
and journalism. He will not write and edit and 
make up the publication himself. He will so 
teach, suggest, correct, and direct that the pub- 
lication will be well written, well edited, and at- 
tractively made up by the pupils on its staff. 
VI 
Waser: shall a school principal find a capable 
teacher of journalism, or, rather, how shall such 
teachers be produced? — for the supply is lim- 
ited. 
If the principal cannot find a teacher who has 
had a good college course in the subject or one 
who has had practical experience on a daily news- 
paper, he should induce one of his faculty mem- 
144 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  
STUDENT PUBLICATIONS 
bers to prepare for the teaching of journalism and 
the guidance of the school publication. The 
preparation can be obtained through a college 
course in journalism (perhaps an extension 
course such as will not require the teacher to take 
a leave of absence) or through actual work on the 
editorial staff of a daily. 
It should be possible to obtain one or the other 
of these during the summer vacation. 
It makes little difference whether a man or 
woman be selected to prepare to teach the 
journalism class, but it is quite important that 
the teacher selected be young, alert, and of good 
personality. Newspaper work is a “young 
person’s game.” It demands so much in the 
way of alertness, adaptability, and what may be 
termed a reserve of nervous and physical energy, 
that it is essentially an undertaking for those 
still in the freshness of youth. 
In schools having a salary schedule which 
recognizes by suitable increases of salary ad- 
ditional courses and extension work taken at 
college, equivalent credit should be given to a 
teacher who, instead of spending the vacation 
period at summer school, takes up newspaper 
work to prepare himself for teaching journalism.

| FINancinc the school newspaper may be diffi- 
cult, especially in the earlier stages of its exist- 
ence. Unlike the daily newspaper, it is not run 
for profit. Until it has built up a circulation and 
has obtained substantial advertising contracts, 
it is confronted with a deficit unless it can begin 
its operation and carry on for a period on bor- | 
rowed capital or on money obtained through 
school entertainments, bazaars, or other means. 
When profit does come, it should be spent on 
making the paper better. 
Such is the educational value of the paper 
project that some cities, especially those in the 
West, subsidize it, paying part or all of the print- 
ing costs. If the board of education has given 
the school a print shop equipped to publish the 
paper, that amounts to a subsidy. Many school 
print shops are so lacking in press and type 
facilities that they succeed only in botching what 
might otherwise be attractive publications. 
The board of education may grant a cash sub- 
sidy so that the paper can be printed in a well- 
equipped commercial shop. 
The whole question of subsidy is likely to re- 
sult in differences of opinion. Those who argue 
146
-P-A-G-E-157
  STUDENT PUBLICATIONS 
for a subsidy may point out that a school paper 
is as deserving of financial support by the board 
of education as are the laboratories for the study 
of chemistry and physics. 
On the other hand, the growth in ability and 
character which comes from earnest and con- 
sistent efforts on the part of the members of the 
business staff in the sale of advertising space and 
in the building of circulation, is also to be con- 
sidered. The financial success of the paper is a 
goal the attainment of which requires the loyalty 
and devoted work of every member of the staff. 
With every achievement the standard of the 
paper is raised. New expenses are set up and a 
new goal must be met. A school paper, during 
the course of a few years, can achieve triumphs in 
the business department as well as in the edito- 
rial department. The question of subsidy, there- 
fore, is one which every school or board of edu- 
cation must answer for itself. If a subsidy is 
granted, it is best that it come from the school 
itself rather than from the board of education. 
VIII 
Pupits who do acceptable work on the staff of the 
high-school paper should receive a just amount of 
credit for such work to count toward graduation. 
147
-P-A-G-E-158
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
At the present time there is no uniform prac- 
tice followed. Some schools grant more credit 
than others for this work. Some grant none at 
all. The argument of some principals is that 
many colleges do not recognize such credit in 
their entrance requirements. It is much harder 
to do acceptable work for a school paper of high 
standard than it is to do acceptable work in an 
ordinary class in English composition or litera- 
ture. The colleges should be made to see this 
point. There is no reason why acceptable work 
on the school paper should not be credited as 
work in English. 
In a city school system where there are many 
junior and senior high schools it is recommended 
that all follow a uniform journalism program in 
so far as it is practicable, and that all grant the 
same amount of credit for the same unit of work 
done. 
Ix 
TEACHERS and supervisors of English, themselves 
lacking a training in journalism, must be edu- 
cated to the point at which they can see the 
possibilities of the school paper project. Toa 
less extent the same holds true for teachers of 
other subjects. Every member of the faculty 
148 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
  STUDENT PUBLICATIONS 
should be brought to realize that, as the paper is 
to touch every department, every activity, and 
every group in the school, the cheerful codpera- 
tion of all is needed to build its success. 
The staff of the paper itself, like a football 
team, must have good morale. There must be 
harmony; the members must respect the author- 
ity of the pupils in executive positions. The 
pupils selected for the staff must have respect 
one for another on the basis of ability and per- 
sonality. The capable teacher of journalism will 
see to it that the staff does not “go stale.” 
x 
Lirtte has been said of school magazines in this 
chapter for the reason that they do not present 
the problems nor do they offer the advantages of 
the school newspaper, though sometimes they 
are desirable and are not without their points of 
advantage. 
The school magazine is similar to other maga- 
zines in form and content. It is essentially liter- 
ary in character and its field of appeal is not so 
wide as that of the newspaper. In the outside 
world there are magazines which do have an ap- 
peal as great or nearly as great as that of the 
daily newspaper. It will be observed, however, 
149
-P-A-G-E-160
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
that these represent, with few exceptions, a 
relatively recent development in the publishing 
field. Their style is more journalistic than liter- 
ary — The Saturday Evening Post and The 
American, for example — and they make large 
use of expensive illustrations to assist in their 
popular appeal. 
Some high schools have both newspaper and 
magazine, and there is no reason why they 
should not have both if each is assured of sup- 
port. In typography and arrangement the 
magazine is not nearly so complex as the news- 
paper. Nearly any good English teacher, with 
the aid of a first-class printer, can direct the 
production of a high-school magazine. If a 
school is to choose between magazine and news- 
paper, it should choose the latter to obtain the 
largest possibilities and results. 
XI 
ScHOOL newspapers of the kind discussed in this 
chapter are best adapted to high schools and 
junior high schools. 
Pupils in elementary schools, particularly in 
the lower grades, would find even a simple printed 
paper beyond their powers. Nevertheless, ele- 
mentary schools can make use of the simpler 
150 
   
-P-A-G-E-161
  STUDENT PUBLICATIONS 
newspaper methods in preparing mimeographed 
or hand-written accounts of school activities. 
The pupils in all rooms may be encouraged to 
describe activities in which they are taking part. 
They should be trained to seize upon the out- 
standing and significant features and to write 
accurately about them. The compositions thus 
produced can be read aloud to the class or 
written on the blackboard for criticism and cor- 
rection. Then the best from every room can be 
mimeographed, or each child can write his own 
paper for his parents. These hand-written pa- 
pers should be read and perhaps graded by the 
teacher as other written exercises are graded, and 
precautions should be taken to make sure that 
misleading information is not placed in the hands 
of parents in this manner. 
Many elementary schools are issuing these 
hand-written or mimeographed “newspapers.” 
Sometimes the sheets are bound within a painted 
cover or are otherwise made to carry special ap- 
peal. Through these hand-made papers ele- 
mentary schools are receiving benefits similar to 
those which come from the high-school news- 
paper. In the matter of parental codperation 
especially the paper project is of great value to 
elementary schools.

SOME FEATURES OF A CONSTRUCTIVE 
PROGRAM 
I 
Wate differing from each other in many essen- 
tials of purpose and practice the newspaper and 
the public school have much in common. Both 
are important factors in popular education. The 
facts and impressions which people get from the 
newspapers supplement what they learn or have 
learned in school. Information appearing in the 
newspapers is used in thousands of public school 
classrooms. In the field of science and current 
history and economics the newspapers present 
information more up-to-date than that appearing 
in the school textbooks. 
The schools need the newspapers, not only as 
media to disseminate information about public 
education, but to help in the task of educat- 
ing the public. And the newspapers need the 
schools, for they cannot flourish in a country 
without popular education. Their very exist- 
ence is based on literacy. The school children of 
152
-P-A-G-E-163
  
A CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAM 
to-day are the adult readers of the newspapers 
of to-morrow. 
The common interest in education cannot help 
but bring the public schools and the press to 
better understanding of each other. 
Suppose that the newspaper worker could 
catch something of the inspiration and vision 
that are in the heart and mind of the teacher who 
sees the fundamental human and social signifi- 
cance of the public schools, and could, as through 
the eyes of such a teacher, envisage the countless 
untouched possibilities of the schools — possi- 
bilities which only await public recognition for 
their realization. Suppose that the teacher, 
recognizing the vast possibilities for good in the. 
public press and understanding that this good 
can be attained through a gradual process of 
evolution, were able, as a result of knowledge 
of journalistic principles and practice, to make 
constructive school news of sufficient interest to 
print in the commercial press. 
On the basis of such suppositions, may one not 
predict that out of codperation between school 
and press there will result better schools, better 
newspapers, and a better America?

Opportunity to know essential points of the 
principles and practices of newspapers should be 
given to young men and women who are being 
trained for the teaching profession, and espe- 
cially to those expecting to become school 
administrators. It may be given through the 
teaching of journalism and of the principles of 
school publicity in teacher-training institutions. 
The Cleveland School of Education, the 
teacher-training institution of the Cleveland 
school system, offers two courses in journalism. 
One of these is open to undergraduates, young 
women preparing to enter the elementary schools. 
It counts as a course in English. The pupils 
taking it comprise the staff of the official student 
newspaper of the School of Education. The 
other is open to selected junior and senior high- 
school teachers, as an extension subject offered 
jointly by the School of Education and Western 
Reserve University. 
The course for undergraduates is taken by 
large numbers of students every year. As these 
students graduate and become teachers in the 
elementary schools of the city, they carry with 
them an understanding of news psychology and 
154 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  A CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAM 
of the value of the daily press which, in time, may 
be expected to permeate the school system. Also, 
as a result of their experience on the School of 
Education newspaper, they are equipped to di- 
rect elementary-school newspaper projects of the 
kind alluded to in Chapter VII. 
The course for teachers is designed to train 
teachers to take charge of junior and senior high- 
school newspapers and to teach journalism in 
those schools. A unique feature of it is an ar- 
rangement, virtually a partnership between the 
city’s newspapers and the School of Education, 
whereby the teachers taking it receive at least 
six full weeks’ practical experience on the edi- 
torial staff of a Cleveland daily newspaper. Fol- 
lowing their service on the newspapers, the 
students in this course have one semester in the 
theory and practice of educational journalism, 
the group meeting together for an hour once a 
week for a series of lectures on journalism, on the 
relationship between the public schools and the 
public press, the teaching of journalism to junior 
and senior high-school pupils, the various prob- 
lems in building high-school newspapers of high 
standard, the critical examination of high-school 
publications, etc. 
Occasionally the group is addressed by a news- 
155 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
paper worker — an editor, writer, advertising 
manager, or business manager. Its members 
report on assigned readings and studies and there 
is careful criticism of high-school publications. 
Teachers enrolling for this course are supposed 
to obtain their practical newspaper experience 
during the summer vacation. The classroom 
work and lectures come at late afternoon or 
evening during the fall or spring semester of the 
School of Education. 
There are four daily newspapers in Cleveland 
— two morning papers and two afternoon papers. 
Before the course was considered for adoption, 
the opinions of the editors of the four papers 
were sought. All expressed favorable interest. 
One editor was enthusiastic and offered imme- 
diately to take as many as six teachers on his 
editorial staff during the summer vacation and 
so to arrange their work that all six would receive 
experience in make-up and editorial writing as 
well as in the many phases of reporting. An- 
other editor was skeptical of the benefits the 
plan would bring to his paper, but was willing to 
employ one or two teachers, nevertheless. Both 
of these editors insisted that teachers joining 
their staffs go on the payroll as regular employees. 
To try out the plan it was decided to select but 
156
-P-A-G-E-167
  A CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAM 
two teachers to take the course the first year 
(1923). One of these worked on an afternoon 
paper; the other worked on a morning paper. 
Each received a salary of $20 a week, paid by 
the newspaper. Each worked about six weeks. 
Each came back to the schools prepared to at- 
tempt larger things in school journalism. Each 
enjoyed her newspaper experience. One, speak- 
ing of this, said: “It was the most delightful 
vacation I ever spent. I loved every minute I 
worked on the paper and became a real mem- 
ber of the editorial family. I learned a great 
deal about newspaper writing — thinking and 
writing quickly. As an experiment in practical 
journalism I think the idea of placing teachers 
on newspapers is excellent. I’m sure the time 
I spent in practical newspaper work during the 
summer was more valuable than any university 
summer course in journalism I might have 
taken.’” 
The other teacher made a similar report. Both 
of these teachers — they are young women — 
must have made a good impression on the news- 
papers which employed them, for both were of- 
fered permanent positions in newspaper work. 
Such a course, if operated successfully, should 
eliminate the present difficulty which the city’s 
157
-P-A-G-E-168
PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
high-school and junior high-school administra- 
tors have in obtaining teachers adequately 
trained to teach high-school journalism and 
produce excellent high-school papers. Specific 
reference has been made to this Cleveland course 
because it suggests advantages which may be 
attained by similar newspaper-public school 
coéperation in other places. In smaller places 
particularly, the practical newspaper experience 
opened to teachers by such a course can be val- 
uable. In large cities the reportorial and edi- 
torial work of the dailies is specialized; in smaller 
communities there is much less specialization. 
The teacher who spends six weeks on a small- 
town newspaper is almost sure to obtain better 
all-round training than he would receive on a big 
city daily, unless, as in Cleveland, special pains 
were generously taken by the big paper to make 
the six weeks as interesting and profitable as 
possible. 
Tt 
ANOTHER service rendered by Cleveland papers 
in recent years which has made many friends for 
them, and which has been of help to many high- 
school students and teachers, has consisted of the 
papers’ generous codperation with the Hi-Press 
158
-P-A-G-E-169
  A CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAM 
Club. This is a club open to the editors, business 
managers, faculty supervisors, and reporters on 
the staffs of the city’s senior high-school papers. 
The members meet fortnightly through the school 
year to discuss various phases of school jour- 
nalism. 
Frequently the club is addressed by a news- 
paper writer whose talk is followed by a discus- 
sion and whose points are given immediate and 
practical application in criticism of the latest 
issues of the school papers. 
The many newspaper representatives who have 
met with the youths of the Hi-Press Club have 
seemed to enjoy the meetings as much as the 
youngsters. One newspaper whose own interest 
in amateur journalism was aroused through con- 
tact with the club has made it possible for some 
of the work of school-paper reporters and editors 
to appear in its own columns. 
All of the city’s public high-school newspapers 
are represented in the Hi-Press Club and all 
compete in annual contests for trophy cups 
which are awarded by the four daily papers of 
the city. One paper gives a cup to the senior 
high paper which is considered the best in the 
city; another gives a cup to the senior high paper 
which has made the greatest improvement dur- 
159
-P-A-G-E-170
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
ing the school year; a third awards cups to the 
senior and junior high papers with the best edi- 
torial pages; a fourth gives a cup to the best 
junior high-school publication. The competi- 
tion for the cups, which are awarded in appropri- 
ate auditorium programs, arouses keen interest 
throughout the junior and senior high schools. 
This recognition by the big dailies of the student 
publications not only is helping make better 
high-school newspapers, but is greatly increas- 
ing the effectiveness of the school publications. 
These are growing steadily in value as promoters 
of the most desired school morale. 
In addition to the Hi-Press Club there is an 
organization of teachers of journalism, formed 
in 1923. It meets monthly for professional con- 
sideration of the special problems of school 
publications. Its first work was setting up a 
standard course in journalism for junior and 
senior high schools. 
IV 
Workers on Cleveland papers have given gen- 
erously of their time and ability to the school 
pupils and teachers interested in journalism. To 
members of the Hi-Press Club they have ex- 
plained and illustrated the feature story, the 
160
-P-A-G-E-171
A CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAM 
straight news story, and the devices in make-up 
and headlines. Sport writers, feature writers, 
editorial writers, special department writers, ad- 
vertising and business specialists have been glad 
to offer advice and counsel to the youngsters on 
the high-school paper staffs or to lead discus- 
sions of newspaper methods and problems before 
the organization of journalism teachers or the 
teacher-training class. 
Out of this service, for which there has been no 
financial remuneration whatsoever, there have 
arisen many friendships between the school work- 
ers and the newspaper workers. 
In some of the city’s schools has come a 
gradual change in attitude toward the daily 
newspaper. Some teachers and administrators, 
who formerly were unwilling to help the papers 
obtain school news or who were indifferent as to 
whether they got it or not, have become inter- 
ested codperators with the papers. Some news- 
paper workers, it is possible, through their con- 
tact with teachers on the common ground of an 
interest in journalism, have caught something of 
the inspiration and vision of the teacher, some- 
thing of the inspiring possibilities of America’s 
public schools.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
iL 
THE consequences of maintaining proper rela- 
tionships between the public and the schools ex- 
press themselves in a variety of ways, outstand- 
ing among which are the following: 
(z) The effect on school financing. 
(2) Effect on school legislation. 
(3) Effect on the supply of teachers. 
(4) Effect on civic pride. 
II 
TuE effect upon school financing will not be im- 
mediate, but it will be determinative. More. 
than one educator is so busy trying to devise 
means of raising money with which to carry on 
his work that he has little time or inclination left 
for his real job. 
That this is true of many college and univer- 
sity presidents is a notorious faet. Many of 
them spend days or even weeks each year lobby- 
ing before State legislatures, or in conferences 
162
-P-A-G-E-173
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
with wealthy men from whom they hope to ob- 
tain money. 
Many higher institutions are never heard of by 
the general public except on those occasions when 
some “campaign” is afoot to raise money. 
“Drives” for endowment funds are familiar 
phenomena, with their purchased advertising, 
their billboards, and their circular letters. 
Often the public school administrator is sim- 
ilarly preoccupied with money-raising schemes, 
but since all of his revenue must come out of the 
pockets of the taxpayer, he aims at a different 
objective. 
Too often public school authorities have 
thought of publicity in the same terms as has 
the college president. They have seen spas- 
modic and intensive “advertising” campaigns 
designed to win votes for additional tax levies or 
for bond issues, and while such campaigns fre- 
quently succeed, they are always expensive and 
- always distract the attention of teachers and 
pupils from the real job of education. 
The propriety of spending the taxpayer’s 
money for advertising may always be ques- 
tioned. The bad effects of attendant criticism 
may offset, in the long run, the immediate ad- 
vantages. 
163
-P-A-G-E-174
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
“ In addition, while the taxpayers may be willing 
to come to the rescue once or twice, they eventu- 
ally will tire of periodic campaigns for support. 
In the end they will revolt and insist that educa- 
tion be conducted with moneys already voted, 
and each succeeding “drive” for support will 
find them less sympathetic and harder to con- 
vince. 
/ So the spasmodic campaign must be dropped 
from consideration as an effective factor in school 
publicity. Rather, publicity must be so man- 
aged that it will result in a constant, construc- 
tive, and sympathetic attitude on the part of the 
public — not once a year, but every day in the 
year. The citizen must feel that the schools 
of his community are being effectively adminis- 
tered and he must always be in the mood to co- 
operate. 
When that happy result has been achieved, 
the “drive” for support becomes unnecessary. 
The voter already is in possession of all the neces- 
sary information as to the needs of the schools. 
This presupposes, of course, honesty and in- 
telligence upon the part of the school adminis- 
tration. It presupposes, too, a complete will- 
ingness to state adverse facts and to admit

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
When the voter, in passing a school building, 
can feel, ‘‘This is a good school. Its teachers 
are devoted to the interests of the children and 
the methods employed are intelligent and pro- 
gressive. But the teachers should be better 
paid, the building should be remodeled, and the 
playground enlarged” — when the voter can 
be made to feel all this, no question remains as 
to what he will do when he goes to the ballot box. 
Effective school publicity, then, to repeat, is 
‘not a matter of occasional drives; it aims to 
promote complete all-year-round support and 
sympathy between the taxpayer and the school 
by the use of every legitimate means by which 
the school can tell its story — the newspapers, 
the school house organ, school newspapers, par- 
ent-teacher clubs, reports and monographs — in 
accordance with the principles already outlined. 
ir 
Ir the State legislature sets the tax rate for the 
schools or in other ways has a determining voice 
in the conduct of education, the necessity for 
proper relations between the school system and 
the legislature becomes obvious. 
Most State legislatures are dominated by rep- 
resentatives from rural districts who are unfa- 
165 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
miliar with the work of the public school in the 
metropolitan centers. The rural legislator thinks 
of school in the terms of the one-room cross-roads 
shack or the township consolidated grade school. 
He does not appreciate the necessity for health 
work, dental clinics, community centers, night 
classes for the foreign-born, and many other 
activities, in the nature of social service, which 
must be undertaken effectively in the larger 
cities by the public schools. ~ 
But the legislator is far more sensitive to 
popular opinion than is generally supposed. 
Frequently the receipt of a dozen letters from 
constituents will be sufficient to cause a legis- 
lator to change his attitude on a subject. And if 
a public school system has the support of its 
community, it may be expected that a large 
number of such letters will be written. 
If the school system publishes a house organ, 
such as is described in Chapter II, it would be 
well to see that the names of influential legislators 
are placed on the mailing list. 
IV 
EFFECTIVE school publicity can also be made to 
count heavily, if indirectly, upon the supply of 
teachers. 
166
-P-A-G-E-177
  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
A large city employing thousands of teachers 
is seldom able to produce itself all the teaching 
talent required. A teachers’ training school may 
supply three hundred or more teachers for the 
system each year, but in the larger cities this 
number may be insufficient. 
Every large school system, therefore, is forced 
to comb two or three States, often at con- 
siderable expense, to find suitable material. 
The effect of this, unfortunately, has been to 
drain off from the smaller communities to the 
larger cities the most competent teachers, leaving 
the less efficient behind. 
Many teachers prefer the larger cities because 
of more attractive salaries offered, and because 
of the greater opportunities for self-improve- 
ment. 
Now the effect of proper publicity in regard to 
‘this problem is to make teaching as a profession 
so attractive that many more and better quali- 
fied young persons will become candidates for 
classroom positions, and so to increase the repu- 
tation of the school system as to make employ- 
ment in it a signal recognition in itself. 
A school system that enjoys a reputation for 
excellence, a reputation reflected by articles in 
the newspapers and in professional journals, no 
167
-P-A-G-E-178
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
matter how small it may be, will attract pro- 
fessionally minded teachers. Good teachers 
naturally prefer to work where opportunities for 
professional self-improvement and advancement 
are best, salary and working conditions being 
nearly equal. 
¥ 
A scHoot system that enjoys a national reputa- 
/ tion for excellence never fails to appeal to the 
pride of the citizen. Literature distributed by 
Chambers of Commerce, designed to attract 
visitors or permanent residents, seldom fails to 
make mention of this aspect of community life. 
Pride in certain schools also is operative within 
the community. A real estate dealer, trying to 
sell home sites, doesn’t fail to mention, along 
with paved streets, water mains and electric light, 
the fact that “a good school is within five min- 
utes’ walk.” In a sense this is an acknowledg- 
ment of the great importance attached to educa- 
tion by the American people. 
Business men are proud to have their city 
known for the excellence of its schools, and for 
this reason Chambers of Commerce, advertising 
clubs and other organizations are often glad to 
codperate in spreading the fame of the system. 
168
-P-A-G-E-179
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
In addition, many large department stores, 
banks, and manufacturing concerns publish 
house organs for their own employees, and many 
of these house organs will be found to be open to 
the educator for the dissemination of articles on 
part-time education and the like. 
VI 
Jeatousy is the green-eyed monster of publicity 
no less than of love. The school superintendent 
who feels pique every time his own good deeds 
are attributed to a subordinate will not progress 
very far in publicity, especially where the news- 
papers are concerned. 
If the superintendent shows a disposition to 
monopolize all the publicity for himself, he will 
find himself unpopular with the press. He must 
be frank in assigning proper credit to his sub- 
ordinates, remembering that the problem is to 
win respect and confidence for the entire school 
system, rather than for any single individual. 
But when he is careful to point out the good 
works of his subordinates, he probably will find 
that they will be equally generous in emphasizing 
his own good works. 
It is important that the school administrator 
should not betray extreme anxiety to have a 
169
-P-A-G-E-180
    PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
piece of news published. Undue anxiety creates 
suspicion of his motive. And it is just as im- 
portant that he should not attempt to suppress 
adverse news. 
If the school system is operated on an open- 
door policy in respect to the newspapers, report- 
ers will, as a matter of fact, obtain unfavorable as 
well as favorable news. But if the reporter’s op- 
portunities for discovering unfavorable news are 
extended, they are just as much facilitated for 
obtaining favorable news. The adverse stories 
are certain to come, but in the long run the judg- 
ment of the public is not formed by one adverse 
story, or by two or three, but by the tenor of the 
news over a long period of time. 
The school administrator whose attention to 
publicity is limited to an effort to obtain publica- 
tion of the favorable is defeating his own ends. 
The stories may actually be good as news, but 
the newspapers will “play them down.” They 
will consider them the self-advertisements of the 
administrator and it will be suspected that the 
work in some other respect is so poor that he is 
trying to forestall unfavorable criticism in the 
future by putting his best foot forward in the 
present. 
It is only human that the board of education, 
170
-P-A-G-E-181
  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
the superintendent, and his assistants should 
want to minimize the bad and emphasize the 
good to the end that the public will be pleased 
with the administration of the schools. It is 
natural that they should wish to put the best foot 
forward, and that they should rely upon what 
they themselves say about the system to produce 
the desired impression rather than upon the sys- 
tem itself with its shortcomings. But it is far 
better that they should devote their attention 
to improving the system, and then let it speak 
for itself. 
The educator who runs to see the editor every 
time he suspects an adverse story is to be printed 
will be unpopular with the editor who naturally 
feels that he is competent to conduct his own 
business without the advice of the educator, just 
as the educator feels himself competent to run 
his business without the advice of the editor. He 
should be upon friendly terms with the editor, 
but it must be a reciprocated friendship, and so 
far as the educator is concerned it must be sus- 
tained on a plane of simple dignity. He must not 
permit the editor to feel that he is currying favor 
with him, or that he stands in fear of him. 
What is the educator to do when he finds an 
adverse story has been printed? First of all, 
171 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
he should not worry. He should remember that 
news is ephemeral, that the public will not long 
remember any single story. To-morrow the 
trend of the news may be in his favor. 
However, there are two sides to every story, and 
the educator is entitled to an opportunity to pre- 
sent his side of any controversial matter. News- 
paper ethics require the editor to present both 
sides, and to permit the educator to defend himself. 
If the newspaper has an adverse story that it 
insists upon printing, the educator is entitled to 
state his own position and it is his duty to in- 
sist upon that right. 
If detailed charges of inefficiency in the schools 
are made, for example, the administration may 
answer them in detail, but in most cases it is 
better to make the answer as brief, as dignified 
and as forceful as possible. 
Every school system has some inefficiency in 
it. To answer detailed charges of inefficiency in 
detail is not always possible. The administrator 
often can make his best case by a simple state- 
ment in which he admits that some of the charges 
are true, some untrue, and some exaggerated, 
and then by outlining the general policies gov- 
erning the administration. 
If his policies are, as a whole, sound, he is justi- 
172
-P-A-G-E-183
  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
fied in assuming that when they are correctly 
understood they will be supported and that the 
public will overlook some minor points of ineffi- 
ciency when it is assured that the administration 
is trying honestly to correct them. 
But too much adverse criticism of any institu- 
tion or person often has a “boomerang” effect. 
The American people are generously minded and 
are often “for” the ‘under dog.” The city of 
New York within recent years has elected as 
mayor a man who was bitterly opposed by every 
“respectable” and influential newspaper in the 
city. Similarly, the city of Cleveland, Ohio, 
elected a man who was opposed editorially by 
every newspaper in the city and who made not 
one speech in his own behalf in the whole course 
of his campaign. 
The public does not accept as true everything 
it sees in its newspapers, and the news, recording 
facts, is far more potent in influencing opinion 
than the editorial page where the opinions of the 
editor are set forth. “Let me write the news of the 
country and I care not who writes its editorials.” 
Vit 
Tue educator is too often a schoolmaster in re- 
spect to the written or printed word. He is 
173 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  PUBLICITY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
meticulous in his concern for technical perfection 
in writing. He is bowed down by a solecism and 
distracted by a split infinitive. He may tend to 
place form above substance. 
Newspaper articles about the schools will lack 
something in polish and ‘refinement, due to the 
haste with which they are written. Occasion- 
ally the interviewer may attribute language to 
the educator that may be lacking in grammatical 
exactness, but the latter must remember that he 
will be judged by what he says, more than by the 
manner in which it is said. Ideas, not words, 
count for most. If the idea is correct, he can 
afford to let the words take care of themselves. 
VII 
EFFEcTIvE publicity, whatever its object, works 
by indirection. Fulsome praise, either of a brand 
of soap or of a school system, is always dis- 
counted. 
School publicity must have as its only object 
the telling of the story of education. If itis a 
good story, true and interesting, the reader will 
draw from it those inferences which will win his 
confidence and enlist his support.

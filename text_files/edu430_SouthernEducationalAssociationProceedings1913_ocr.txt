SECRETARY-TREASURER’S REPORT. 
NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, October 30, 1913. 
To the Board of Directors of the S. E. A., Nashville, Tenn.: 
I beg to submit the following report of my work as Secre- 
tary-Treasurer of the Southern Educational Association since 
the last meeting of the Association in Louisville, Ky., on Nov. 
27, 1912: 
By your direction, your Secretary, soon after the adjourn- 
ment of the Louisville meeting, issued a pamphlet giving a sten- 
ographic report of the proceedings of the Southern Educational 
Council. These pamphlets were sent to every member of the 
Association and were generally distributed over the South. 
There have been two meetings of the Executive Committee 
since our last annual meeting. One of these was held in Atlanta, 
Ga., and the other in Birmingham, Ala. 
The proceedings of the Louisville meeting were in the
-P-A-G-E-17

hands of the members of the Association within sixty days 
after our adjournment last year. 
During the past year several back volumes of the proceed- 
ings have been sold, but we still have on hand the following 
volumes:

  Your Secretary-Treasurer has kept an accurate account of 
all receipts and disbursements since making his last annual re- 
port, and has kept all funds in the bank and paid all items by 
check. I have with me all record books, vouchers, etc., and a 
few days agao President Brittain was requested to appoint a spe- 
cial committee to carefully check and report on my books, etc. 
I presume this committee is ready to report to you this morn-

You will recall in his last annual report, your Secretary 
recommended that a committee be appointed to draft a new 
Constitution to be submitted to the Association at the 1913 
meeting. In accordance with this recommendation, a committee 
composed of Dr. J. H. Phillips, Supt. M. A. Cassidy, and Dr. 
Junius Jordan was selected to formulate and introduce a resolu- 
tion at the business meeting of the Association on Saturday, 
November 30, 1912, calling for a committee of five members in- 
cluding the President and Secretary of the Association, to draft 
a new Constitution to be submitted to the next meeting of the 
Association—the three additional members of the committee to 
be appointed by the President of the Association. For some 
reason this resolution was not included in the resolutions intro- 
duced and passed at the business meeting held on Saturday, 
November 30, 1912, and hence no legal steps in this matter 
could be taken during the year. Some action should be taken at 
our present meeting, and the Association is so fully agreed on 
the matter that I believe not the slightest opposition will be 
made, if a report is submitted at the business meeting to be held 
on Saturday morning, November 1, 1918. Article 7 of the Con- 
stitution provides that it may be altered or amended at a regu- 
lar annual meeting by a’ unanimous vote of the members pres- 
ent. 
At the Chattanooga meeting in December, 1910, I was 
elected Secretary of the Association to fill the unexpired term 
of Mr. Bierly. At the Houston meeting in November, 1911, the 
offices of Secretary and Treasurer were combined and I was 
elected Secretary-Treasurer for a term of four years. Two of 
those years have expired, and I have tried to serve you to the 
best of my ability. On account of the change soon to be made in 
my educational position in Alabama, it is absolutely necessary 
that I ask you to accept my resignation, to take effect at the
-P-A-G-E-19

close of this meeting. I do this most reluctantly, for I assure 
you my relationship with the Board of Directors and the mem- 
bers of the entire Association has been most pleasant. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Wo. F. FEAGIN, 
Secretary-Treasurer.

  20 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
MINUTES OF THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE BOARD OF 
DIRECTORS 
OF THE 
SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, October 30, 1913. 
At a meeting of the Board of Directors held this day in 
room No. 309, Hermitage Hotel, the following members were 
present: 
Pres. M. L. Brittain, Prof. Geo. M. Lynch, Prof. W. K. 
Tate, Supt. Lawton B. Evans, Dr. Gustavus R. Glenn, Dr. Jno. 
R. Kirk, Dr. Junius Jordan, Supt. C. W. Richards, Dr. J. H. 
Phillips, Supt. C. H. Seigler, Dr. D. B. Johnson, Pres. R. I. 
Jones, Dr. H. L. Whitfield, Dr. Julian A. Burruss, Dr. T. W. 
Palmer, Wm. F. Feagin. 
The minutes of the last annual meeting of the Association 
were read and approved, and the annual report of the Secretary- 
Treasurer was read and ordered filed. 
Wm. F. Feagin presented his resignation as Secretary- 
Treasurer of the Association, stating that on account of the 
change in his educational position in Alabama it was absolutely 
necessary for him to do so, said resignation to take effect at the 
close of the present meeting. 
Dr. H. L. Whitfield moved that the resignation of Mr. Feagin 
be not accepted, which motion was seconded. Mr. Feagin made 
a detailed statement of the necessity for his resignation, and 
after this the following resolution introduced by Supt. Lawton B. 
Evans as a substitute to the motion made by Dr. Whitfield, was 
unanimously passed: 
Resolved, That the Board of Directors feel that Wm. F. Feagin in offer- 
ing his resignation as Secretary-Treasurer does so after due consideration 
of his obligations to the new labors involved by his appointment as State 
Superintendent of Education of Alabama, and that any insistence upon the 
withdrawal of his resignation is an injustice to Mr. Feagin and would be 
unavailing. 
Resolved, That the Board of Directors accept the resignation of Mr. 
Feagin with sincere regret, with every expression of confidence and consid- 
eration, and with assurances of its deep appreciation of his faithful, effective 
service. 
After a thorough discussion of the matter, Mr. R. A. Clay- 
ton of Birmingham, Ala., was nominated and elected Secretary-
-P-A-G-E-21
  
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 21 
Treasurer to succeed Mr. Feagin, the election being for the un- 
expired term of two years. 
Dr. H. L. Whitfield, former President of the Association, 
made a statement relative to the expenses of Miss Annie Moore, 
who attended the Louisville meeting in 1912, and who claimed 
that the Association was due her $48.00 for her expenses. After 
discussion it was agreed that the Association was not due this 
amount, but the Board of Directors decided to raise it among 
themselves. On motion a committee composed of Dr. J. H. 
Phillips, Prof. W. K. Tate, and the Secretary-Treasurer was 
appointed to write the President of the Columbia College ex- 
plaining that the Association was not responsible for the ex- 
penses of Miss Moore and making a full explanation of the mat- 
ter. The following members of the Board of Directors sub- 
scribed the amounts opposite their names:

PROCEEDINGS 
OF THE 
SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION, 
Nashville, Tennessee, 
October 30, 31-November 1, 1913. 
FIRST SESSION. 
HiGH SCHOOL BUILDING, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 30, 8:30 P. M. 
The President, M. L. Brittain, Presiding. 
THE CHAIR: Dr. J. H. Kirkland, of Vanderbilt University, 
will deliver an Address of Welcome. 
Dr. J. H. KIRKLAND: It is with very great satisfaction 
that I speak a word of welcome to this gathering of visiting 
teachers this evening, a very.great pleasure to us to look into 
your faces and welcome you here from all parts of the South, 
and to read the program of exercises that you have promised 
us shall be our privilege to hear within the next few days. 
I suppose it is expected of one who speaks a word of wel- 
come regarding such as this, that something be said of the city 
to which you come, particularly of its educational facilities, and 
of the state in whose capital city you are gathered together 
here, and something, perhaps, of its private educational insti- 
tutions, that your present speaker more particularly repre- 
sents, and that constitute a considerable part of the educational 
activities of Nashville. Yet I have it not in my heart to say 
very much along that line this evening. It is true that Tennes- 
see has done and is doing a great work in education, and Nash- 
ville is showing improvements, as may be evidenced by this 
great building, in which you are now gathered. Of these things the 
City Superintendent of City Schools might more properly speak. 
So far as my own life and tasks are concerned, my sense of fail- 
ures, of disappointments, of tasks unachieved, comes over me 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
24 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
so strongly on all occasions, that I would feel great reluctance 
to take up your time and mine in trying to tell you the small 
amount we have done. I should choose to welcome you, rather, 
because it is you, and from the standpoint of your work, and 
what you represent. I welcome you because you stand for these 
great educational influences that are sweeping the land and 
moulding civilization, this great country of ours. I welcome you 
as workers, therefore, in a great cause—the greatest of all 
causes, and as those coming to us able and willing and ready to 
help. 
I gather something of your purpose from your very name. 
I am here to welcome the Southern Educational Association—a 
Southern Association, working in the South, geographically, and 
working for the South, and advocating and standing for a work 
to be done largely and essentially by the South. Whatever may 
be the results reached through the sympathy and support of oth- 
ers, we may never lose sight of the fact that the great task of 
public education in the South is a task that must be achieved by 
a Southern people, and by the great method of public taxation. 
While this is the section of our country to which we are devoting 
ourselves, I trust that in this educational work there is nothing 
sectional in any embarrassing and improper use of that term, 
nothing sectional in any provincial sense, even,—certainly not in 
any sense of hostility to any other section. Education knows no 
sectional lines. Its purpose and its ultimate end is to obliterate 
all feelings of prejudice and ‘animosity, narrowness and provin- 
cialism. The great principles upon which we work are funda- 
mental and universal. Each county, each city, each section may 
have its own problems, and we may have ours. The application 
of these principles may be different in one part of the Union 
from another ; but the great fundamental principles of truth and 
of progress and education are universal and eternal. 
We turn a lever in the hall, and the current of electricity 
that is flowing up and down our streets lights this auditorium 
that we may read. A small lever is turned, and the great locks 
of the Panama Canal are opened, that ships may pass through. 
Tomorrow morning at the breakfast table we may turn a small 
lever, a similar one, and toast a piece of bread for our breakfast. 
The application is varied in every case, but the great principles 
of light and power have not been changed in any of these in- 
stances.  
-P-A-G-E-25
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 25 
And so in our work. It is our task, not to separate, but to 
unite, to restore to our South the feeling of national unity, and 
national service, under the brilliant leadership of that Southern 
man who is now claiming our thought and sympathy and our 
prayers in his arduous labors in Washington. 
It was my sad satisfaction to attend a memorial service a 
few days ago for a man who gives a beautiful illustration of 
life and service for us and to the South, a man known to many 
of you here, who lately passed from among us. Who of us does 
not know, and who, knowing, fails to love and to reverence the 
memory of Robert Ogden, of New York? What a work he did 
for us in the South! How gently, and with what sweet spirit, 
and how affectionately and tenderly! We shall live long without 
seeing another man the equal of Mr. Ogden in achievement for 
Southern education. 
But you are an educational gathering, and what is educa- 
tion? One might fill an hour in giving definitions of it, all 
’ varied, and yet, underlying them all, and running through them 
all, there is one common factor—I suppose only one—and that 
is the child, the individual. So, in all of our theories of educa- 
tion and our work, we go back to the child, or the individual, I 
might say rather than the child; as the center of all educational 
theory and all educational activity we come to the recognition of 
the great truth that education is, after all, a life process, and 
that we are but part of that. We school teachers, it seems to me, 
are inclined to make a mistake magnifying our own relation to 
this task, as if the school were the only instrument of education, 
and we the only class of citizens entitled to be called educators, 
or so we speak of ourselves. Why, my dear friend, that child, 
that boy, was educated before you got hold of him, and your 
failure is because he was educated before you touched your hand 
to the task. Education begins with the song of the mother, with 
the language of the flowers and trees, with the whistle of the 
birds, and the green grass of the fields, and is continued right 
on as long as life lasts. We talk about Nashville as an educa- 
tional center. Yes, it is an educational center, and our educa- 
tion centers about our streets, with their moving shows, with the 
street boys selling newspapers, with their restaurants, and other 
places of amusement, and with the shops where children, boys 
and girls and men and women labor and toil,—and these are its 
educational forces just as truly as its school and the church is.
-P-A-G-E-26
26 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
Our great task is to learn something of the breadth of these 
educational processes, and it is a life process, and we, therefore, 
must relate our tasks and the school to the sweep of the life 
process, vocational education. Yes. Sanitation—Yes. It is a 
new era in the thought of the world to have this great interna- 
tional conference of hygiene and education, such as was held in 
Buffalo last year. 
It is a responsibility when a state enacts a law for com- 
pulsory education—a grievous responsibility—and a privilege. 
It is an obligation that must be paid to every child, and every 
means every. It means all. It means white and black and yel- 
low. It means every child on the street or in the home, in the 
workshop or in the palace. The obligation does not cease in sick- 
ness or in health,—the backward child, or the forward child. It 
was my privilege a few days or weeks ago to see a little group 
of children on top of one of the hospitals in one of our great 
cities, with books, getting their morning lesson on the roof. 
One more word, for already I am exceeding my time limit. 
We are an association that must work together, not through 
antagonisms, but through union of forces, of all forces, of all 
educational institutions, and all life forces, the union of citizens, 
or teachers, governors of the state, the superintendents of educa- 
tion, members of the legislature, with men and women, the 
merchant princes, the teachers and schools with those passing 
by every day on their way to the office—all of these forces must 
in some way be united in the great task. This is the great task 
of the world today—to teach men that life is more than meat, 
and the body is more than raiment. (Applause). 
THE CHAIR: The second address of welcome will be the 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction of Tennessee, Hon. 
S. H. Thompson. 
Hon. 8S. H. THOMPSON: You will excuse this personal 
word when I tell you that for seven days I am the baby State 
Superintendent of the South, and I do that to make the an- 
nouncement that on the first day of November, I understand it, 
your Secretary, Professor Feagin, becomes State Superintendent 
of Public Instruction for the great State of Alabama, so that 
after that date he will, for a short time at any rate, be the baby 
superintendent in Southern education. (Applause).

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 27 
It gives me great personal pleasure to welcome you to the 
City of Nashville and the great State of Tennessee on an occa- 
sion, which should and does bring together so many of the 
South’s distinguished men of learning, that is, the great and the 
near great of our immediate section and indeed of our entire 
nation for that matter. We surrender everything we have to 
you, and if we do not have enough rest assured we will get more. 
In fact, if we should decide to separate we hope you will be like 
the old Scotch servant, who, after much quarreling, was told by 
his master that they would have to separate, whereupon the 
canny Scot responded with “And where are ye goin’, me lord?” 
I sincerely hope you will ask where we of Nashville are going, 
and keep the city for yourselves. 
But, seriously speaking, our coming together does mark 
more than a good social time, all of which we will have as a mat- 
ter of course. I even see in the program that young men are 
admonished to “go South” and stop in Nashville. That is whole- 
some advice. But the thing I see of greatest importance among 
the many is that so large a place is given to the rural school and 
so large a place to the side of rural life which is about all the 
side it has, namely, farming or agriculture, if you choose to call 
it such. I believe a farmer is one who makes his living on the 
farm, and owns property in the city, while an agriculturist is 
one who makes his living in the city and owns a farm. Nothing 
wrong in that if the two of them do not work to cross purposes. 
But a man of authority said to me in Washington recently, “If 
the American farmer knew how to properly market his produce 
his income would be doubled in two years.” 
If the American farmer’s income should be doubled in two 
years there would be some chance to have other incomes double 
that are of vital interest to you and me at this time. Moreover 
there are so many incomes dependent upon the farmer, in fact 
they all are—that whatever effects him gets the rest of us sooner 
or later in some way or other. But all this business is so directly 
related to every sort of vocation in the world that you cannot 
discuss it separately from other things. It is not only state-wide 
but nation-wide. Now and then we hear about the reclamation 
of the South, the dry farming of arid portions of the West, and 
the growing of crops in the expanding Northwest. Perhaps 
more attention is paid to the reclamation of the agricultural
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
South, in discussion at least, than to any one section. Doubtless 
we need it, but I am more hopeful for the future of us all when 
I read that in Missouri, Iowa, Illinois and elsewhere they are 
coming to see that their black dirt will not last forever, and that 
their vital theme must be conservation now or reclamation later. 
What has for years been soil wastes in the great corn belt is rap- 
idly becoming soil preservation to prevent the solving of a prob- 
lem that has been confronting the South for almost a generation. 
The most wholesome sign is for every part of our great country 
to be alert to the idea of conservation and of vocational ideals. 
Such are doubtless needed in one section of the country as much 
as another only along different lines, perhaps. 
Men, to these great endeavors, I welcome you as educators 
and teachers and trainers of reputation and of reputations to be 
made and broken. To the task of setting a vocational education 
from the time-honored halls of the Congress of the United States 
to the practical schools of far off Switzerland with their helpful 
lessons for the South and the rest of the nation; to the delightful 
discussions of a six-year elementary course, community exten- 
sion, codperation of all Southern Association, the family and 
school of the farmer, school work, health and agricultural for- 
estry, and to all the technicalities of higher education. 
But to more than all these, as significant as they may be, I 
welcome you, the final solution of anything in the way of a 
problem, the solution of which means the solution of all prob- 
lems in this country, be they educational or otherwise, and this 
is the problem of the elementary school. Say what you please 
about all problems, and about all questions of higher education, 
when you have settled the question of the rural school all other 
questions settle themselves as rapidly as time may bring them 
on. 
It is to this one thing I welcome you in the name of the 
great State of Tennessee and her more than half a million rural 
children. And may there grow out of this meeting such discus- 
sions and ideas as will lead to the sane and sensible solution of 
this great problem, not only for Tennessee and the South, but 
for the entire nation. To this and other delightful tasks and to 
all the pleasures and comforts of a real metropolitan city, I 
welcome you.

We feel that your coming here is to do us good. We feel 
that we will get more, perhaps, than you will get. We get the 
concentrated wealth of opinion and skilled thought that you 
bring to us. : 
The greatest problem before the American nation today is 
not equal suffrage. It is not the reorganization of the funda- 
mental laws of our country, it is not even the Mexican question. 
It is the education of the millions of children in America, and 
your coming to our city is for the purpose of solving the prob- 
lems that confront us in the education of our children. A cry 
has gone up all over this land that the schools have failed to do 
the task that was allotted to them, and perhaps there is some 
truth in it. Perhaps the great drawback in solving this problem 
has been what my distinguished co-worker, Chancellor Kirkland, 
mentioned—a lack of unity even among school people them- 
selves. My feet and my hands are members of the same body, 
they do not do the same work yet they must work in harmony 
and unity. The private school and the public school are branches 
of the same body, and yet they, perhaps, have not been working 
in harmony and unity,—not that we have been in discord, but we 
have not been working together—they have been working inde- 
pendently. The audience this evening is evidence of it. I judge 
that ninety-five per cent. of the school men here this evening are 
public school men. Where are the private school men, the great 
universities and the colleges of the South? They are not repre- 
sented here. This is not a work for the public schools alone. It 
is not the work for my hand alone. My feet must help, too. 
I read the list of the members of the Southern Association 
of Colleges and Preparatory Schools the other day, and in 
the list of preparatory schools, some thirty-six in number, 
there were less than half a dozen public high schools, and yet 
you know that in the South public high schools are in the great 
majority, and yet, in that association there are less than half a
-P-A-G-E-30

dozen, showing that the public high schools have not done their 
part in that association. We can not expect to solve these prob- 
lems when we work alone. The private school has its place. 
The public university has its place. The private university has 
its place. We are all members of the same great body, working 
for the education of the children of this great country of ours. 
But even worse than that is the lack of codperation of the 
masses with the school people. The trouble has been that the 
citizens of the United States, as a mass, have turned their chil- 
dren over to the school people for a number of years, and expect 
them, at the end of the certain term, to have been handed back 
educated, and except for a few instances, where individual 
parents are intensely interested, we have paid no attention to 
that work, until the child has been turned back. It reminds me 
of a custom we had down here in the good old county of Maury 
some years ago. Some stock men there, raising mules, would 
turn the mules over to the smaller farmers around the country 
to train them up—take them when they were a year old, and 
when they got to be three or four years old return them to the 
stock men. But do you suppose these stock men paid no atten- 
tion to those mules in the interim? Not by any means. They 
followed the work up, and saw that those mules were properly 
cared for and properly trained, so when they got them back they 
could be sent down to Louisana for the sugar fields. But the 
American people have been satisfied to turn the children over to 
the school people, and then expect to get them back fully de- 
veloped citizens after a number of years, and that won’t do, and 
the mistake school people have made is that they have been ready 
to attempt to do this work without the help of the people, and 
that can’t be done. 
But even further than that, the Government of the United 
States has not taken the question of education seriously, and it 
must be done. We have a Department of Education at Washing- 
ton, and it is a side issue—and I mean no disrespect to the de- 
partment—but the Department of Education of the United 
States ought to be put on an equal footing with every other de- 
partment in the government. (Applause.) 
If I were to go out into the suburbs here and start a little 
factory to convert hogs into bacon, what would the United 
States Government do? They would send an inspector to watch
-P-A-G-E-31
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 31 
me, to see that I did my work properly. But I can start a little 
school down here, and nobody come to see, and I can turn out 
all sorts of pupils, and nobody looks after them. Those chil- 
dren are not worth as much as the hogs! 
The people must get together. That is one of the problems 
before you. You are here to help solve these problems. Where 
are the business men tonight? They are not here. I see my 
friend Dr. Morrison here, and he is the only business man that 
I have recognized not connected with the schools. What greater 
interest have you in the United States than in the children, 
and yet the business men of the city are not here. We must 
get the business people. We must get the masses. We must 
get together and work out this great problem, and we hope 
that while you are here you will be able to help us solve some 
of these problems, and as you go back to your homes you will 
be able to carry the news that we in this Southland will get 
together as a unit,—and the system of schools in the South 
will be the best in the world. (Applause). 
THE CHAIR: Ladies and Gentlemen: The pleasant duty 
of responding to these pleasant, kindly addresses of welcome 
was placed in charge of State Superintendent Shawkey, of West 
Virginia, but a message received at a late hour informs me that 
it will not be possible for him to be present with us here this 
evening, and in consequence that duty has shifted to my own 
shoulders. 
Perhaps this preserves me from an infraction of the rules 
of this body, for it has been the custom of the president of the 
association to deliver an address at the opening session and 
what I shall say in response to these kindly words of welcome 
may serve to exonerate me for having intended to break the 
rule. 
We appreciate your hospitality and courtesy. It would 
argue ignorance indeed not to know of this great state and her 
splendid capital city. Your sons from Andrew Jackson and the 
pioneer settlers down to this good hour have won for them- 
selves places abiding and brilliant in their country’s hall of 
fame. Combining the Puritan strength with cavalier grace we 
think of them as among

    382 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
“The Knightliest of the Knightly race 
Who since the days of old 
Have kept the lamps of Victory 
Alight in hearts of gold.” 
This city with Vanderbilt University and the Peabody Col- 
lege for Teachers at the head of your other educational institu- 
tions may well be called the “Athens of the South” and this 
thought was still more impressed upon me when I saw the 
stately Greek temple in your park. You have caught some- 
thing in the buildings of your city of the sunshine and spirit 
of that far-away Attic Capitol whose bright soul as it has shone 
in its literature for a thousand years centered the world’s 
thought as the stars in their courses ever point to the midnight 
sun. 
We have come to you, no less for deliberation and council, 
than to gather something of inspiration which we may carry 
away to our homes from the Potomac to the Rio Grande. 
The Southern Educational Association besides the national 
questions which press upon other sections of the country for 
solution has its own particular problems which cannot be shifted 
to other shoulders. First of all, as it seems to me, is the plain 
necessity of providing better and more adequate training for 
the farmer’s child. This, the most difficult of our problems, if 
it can be correctly solved is an effective back-to-the-farm move- 
ment and keenly affects our national life, for dimly through the 
shining dust of the dead centuries we can see the truth of the 
words that movement cityward is the nation’s funeral march. 
The Negro problem like the poor we always have with us. 
Occasionally a well-meaning man asserts that it has been solved 
and presents no further difficulties but in the depth of his heart 
the thinker knows that the teacher as well as the statesman must 
give more earnest attention and watchful care to this question. 
The widening chasm between the races as the years pass is a 
matter of common remark. Who knows what the Negro is 
thinking—-saying, devising, in his churches, lodges, and societies? 
His training should not be neglected—should be supervised—for 
the sake of the white man no less than his own—and it should be 
more practical and industrial; better suited to the life he must 
live. 
Other subjects we have for discussion. The wastes of time 
in grades as at present arranged in most of our schools is urged

and from the contact of mind against mind we hope will come 
the sparks of truth to enlighten us here. 
Perhaps the newest and most interesting of our educational 
questions is that of state publication of school books. It is true 
that the experiment was made—years ago by California but the 
success of that state was so doubtful—certainly at first—that no 
other followed the example until Kansas passed similar legisla- 
tion within the last few months. From far off Canada, however, 
the news has come that Ontario has something to show us in the 
way of successful experience along this line. The Editorial Sec- 
retary of the Province, Dr. D. J. Goggin, and the man chiefly 
responsible to his people for these texts, has been invited to speak 
‘to us on this subject. (Applause). 
THE CHAIR: Will you permit me to depart just a little 
from the program? Mr. Hobson, who is to be with us this 
evening, is on a delayed train, I understand, which has not yet 
reached the city. In consequence, I wish to ask, after making 
one or two announcements, fearing that they may be lost in the 
general shuffle, we shall first have the appointment of commit- 
tees, and then the last number on the program, after which 
Mr. Hobson will address you.

been on a visit to Switzerland, sent there by the United States 
Department of Education, and he will speak to us upon the 
Schools of Switzerland, and their Suggestions for the South. 
THE SCHOOLS OF SWITZERLAND AND THEIR SUG- 
GESTIONS FOR THE SOUTH. 
(INTRODUCTION TO ILLUSTRATED LECTURE.) 
W. K. TATE, COLUMBIA, S. C. 
Switzerland is a country with few natural resources ex- 
cept its scenery, its water power, and its people. The tran- 
scendent beauty of its landscape results from a topography 
which renders agriculture difficult. The soil yields its harvest 
only when the ingenuity, the skill, and the industry of man have 
subdued the asperities of a natural environment as perverse as 
beautiful. Agriculture in a level, fertile, virgin land consists 
largely in appropriating the spontaneous gifts of friendly na- 
ture. In such a region man’s work is a relatively small item in 
the total result, and the worker sometimes takes second place 
with nature in the subconscious valuation with which society 
takes stock of its resources. Farming on the Alpine slopes of 
Switzerland is another matter. Here man, the conqueror of un- 
friendly forces, is the chief asset and is esteemed accordingly. 
In a country where coal and iron are cheap and plentiful, where 
cotton, lumber, and other raw materials are easily obtained, 
where manufacturing interests are shielded from competition 
and the stream of commerce flows unimpeded through the con- 
tinent, the efficiency of the individual plays a relatively minor 
part in the industrial life. In Switzerland where there is 
neither coal, iron, nor petroleum, where forests have been de- 
pleted, where raw material must be imported from other lands, 
where neighboring powers are jealous competitors, and tariff 
barriers dam ‘the natural flow of commerce within narrow
-P-A-G-E-35
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 35 
boundaries, the very existence of industry and even of the na- 
tional life itself demand in every worker the greatest skill and 
efficiency which can be secured. Here the welfare of the indi- 
vidual worker becomes a chief public concern. 
The Government of Switzerland is organized to further the 
interests and conserve the welfare of the ordinary man. The 
government owns the railroads and these are operated with 
marked efficiency and economy. A railway accident is practi- 
cally unknown. The telegraph lines, the telephone system, and 
the express business are also operated by the government. A 
telegram or a long distance telephone message may be sent any- 
where in Switzerland for ten cents or less. The cantons have 
perfected a system of mortgage banks from which a farmer who 
wishes to acquire land or improve his farm may secure funds at 
four per cent. to be returned in small annual installments ex- 
tending over a period of forty years. This credit system has 
made ninety per cent. of the Swiss farmers land owners. The 
cities own and operate all public utilities, usually including a 
municipal theatre and an employment bureau. There are every- 
where well-organized departments for looking after the poor 
and the unfortunate. The principle that the national resources 
belong to all the people and that the government exists for the 
general welfare is universally accepted. Such a government 
would be called paternalistic by many Americans. It is really 
fraternalistic. It has not been imposed from above, but has 
been devised by the people themselves for the conservation of 
the general welfare. It is really a great codperative machine. 
The responsibility of the citizens for the government is very 
direct and personal. All laws passed by Parliament or by the 
Cantonal Assemblies are subject to a popular referendum. it 
is impossible for a man to be elected as a representative of the 
people through an appeal to some popular prejudice or passion 
and then use his power to make laws for the furtherance of his 
own personal interest or those of his clients. His legislative 
acts must all be submitted to popular approval and disapproval. 
The fact of the referendum emphasizes the importance of the 
individual citizen and awakens a lively desire to have all the 
people educated and intelligent. If left in ignorance, they may 
at any time nullify an important measure which they do not 
understand.

The conservation and utilization of every resource and es- 
pecially of every human asset is the dominant educational ideal 
of Switzerland. The school is the instrument by which a dem- 
ocracy trains its members for efficiency and patriotic service. 
Any need which the State perceives to exist in its citizenship or 
its national life is immediately supplied through some form 
of school. It is considered the duty of society to see that no 
child or-man is wasted but that he is prepared to live most 
efficiently the life which will have most meaning to himself and 
the greatest service to the social whole. 
To the Swiss nation democracy in education does not con- 
sist in placing before people of divers and unequal capacities the 
same sort of education and then inviting each to sieze a pre- 
tended “equal chance” which in reality he is unable to appro- 
priate, but is offering to each man an opportunity to develop 
that ability which he possesses in a school adapted to his needs 
and to the demands of society. 
The American ideal of education which we are modifying 
but slowly is a single ladder with one end in the kindergarten 
and the other extending through the university. This ladder 
we pretend that each has an opportunity to climb. We honor and 
reward the man who succeeds, but those who fail are allowed 
to drop off unnoticed and must climb upward by any difficult 
and devious path which they may devise, or must remain sub- 
merged. This is a fine system for the fellow who gets to the top. 
In the Swiss ideal there are many ladders reaching to many ends 
and the object of chief solicitude is the man who finds climbing 
difficult. This ideal does not develop the super-man but insures 
that high general average which is the basis of a true democracy. 
The national consideration for the man lowest down exhibits 
itself in a multitude of ways. The primary school building is 
usually the best school house in the city. One of the very finest 
buildings which I saw was situated in a section inhabited largely 
by cotton mill operatives. On the whole, the best teaching I ob- 
served was in the primary school, and some of the very best 
teachers in Switzerland are assigned to classes of sub-normal 
children. The poor children attending school are provided with 
a lunch, usually consisting of bread and milk, at half past ten 
o’clock. Clothing and shoes are provided for those who would 
otherwise suffer. There is free medical inspection and free treat-

    ment of children whose parents are unable to give them proper 
attention. 
The larger schools maintain vocation colonies where delicate 
school children are sent to recuperate during the holidays. At- 
tached to the primary school is the Kinderhort, or guardian 
school, where children whose parents are at work in the fac- 
tories and who do not return home until six o’clock are detained 
under the care of the teacher. They are given a lunch and 
kept busy at play, manual training, gardening, or in the prepa- 
ration of the next day’s lessons. 
Even the higher education does not forget the less favored. 
On my visits to the various technical schools I frequently made 
inquiries as to what became of the students after graduation. 
I found that sixty per cent. of the graduates of the School for 
Silk Weavers in Zurich come to America. At the Biel Technical 
School the secretary showed me a list of his graduates contain- 
ing information from which it was seen that a very large per 
cent. of them were working in France, Germany, America, or 
some other foreign country. The same thing was true in the 
School for Industrial Arts at Geneva. Finally I said to the di- 
rector of one of these schools, “I believe that in my State in 
America if it were shown that seventy-five per cent. of the grad- 
uates of an institution took positions in a foreign country or in 
another State, that institution would find difficulty in securing 
an appropriation for maintenance.” 
Such an idea had evidently never occurred to him. He re- 
plied, “It is different with us. These are our boys and girls; 
we are proud when they make good anywhere in the world. Be- 
sides, our country is small, and our population is increasing rap- 
idly. If we do not educate our best young people so that they 
may occupy the higher places at home and abroad, they will be 
compelled to fill the lower places here, and the less capable will 
be ground down in hopeless poverty.” 
This vital relation between the people and their schools has 
given to the school and to the teaching profession a popular dig- 
nity and importance which is unknown in America. 
1 am very happy to say that Capt. Hobson is here, and I 
shall not prolong my remarks. Will some one please turn out 
the lights, and we will have the pictures, which are some that I 
made while in Switzerland. (Applause).

Swiss school system in a series of seventy lantern slides.) 
THE CHAIR: Ladies and Gentlemen: Our next speaker 
we are glad to welcome here, not only because he is an honored 
member of the world’s greatest parliamentary body, our national 
Congress, but I imagine that as long as men’s hearts are stirred 
by deeds of daring they will never forget the hero of the Merri- 
mac, Captain Richmond Pearson Hobson, who will now address 
you. 
HON. RICHMOND PEARSON HOBSON 
Ladies and Gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to me to be 
able to come to this meeting. It is more than a pleasure—it is 
a great privilege. I have come to regard educational work as 
the great work of society. It has become my highest ambition 
to take what part I can in the constructive work of development 
of the educational institutions of our country. 
Perhaps there is no department of our educational system 
that is so conservative, not to say reactionary, as the participa- 
tion of the federal government. The cause for this reactionary 
attitude is not difficult to find. It grew out of the dual form of 
government. Sovereign states within an indissoluble union. 
I shall not undertake to discuss, even in suggestive form, the 
question of states’ rights in the matter bearing upon the educa- 
tional systems of America. Suffice it to say that in my judg- 
ment the basic conclusion upon which this disinclination on the 
part of the federal government to take up educational work rests 
is sound. I believe that it is the right of the state to control 
the education of its children within its borders. I would say, 
on the other hand, that the federal government has a right to 
expect and require, if need be,—of course that word require 
could never properly be brought out in the history of our coun- 
try,—but the federal government has a right to expect that each 
state will fulfill the responsibilitiy that goes with such a basic 
fundamental right. 
It is unnecessary to discuss with you how this question of 
education lies at the very foundation of life, when we look upon 
it as renewing itself from generation to generation. It is, in 
fact, the largest factor in the survival of nations, races and civ- 
ilization. It can be justified, if need be, upon the principle of
-P-A-G-E-39
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 39 
self preservation, and the general welfare clause of the Constitu- 
tion would be sufficient, to say nothing of the principle of self 
preservation, to justify a fundamental interest and vital interest 
on the part of the nation and Federal government in the success 
and efficiency of the educational systems of the several states. 
But I do not see any conflict in these two conceptions, and 
I feel that the first consideration that we ought to keep in mind 
in dealing with a constructive program for Federal aid to educa- 
tion is that we should recognize, from the start, that the State 
has the right to control, and the Federal government should 
never arrogate to itself the right to control the educational ma- 
chinery of a sovereign state. But when this is admitted, and 
the state’s rights advocates are no longer alarmed, I do not be- 
lieve we would find one citizen in a thousand, probably we would 
find none, who would question the right of the federal govern- 
ment to aid and to co-operate with the states in the work of edu- 
eation. So the first conception is that it is aid, and not control, 
that we should keep prominently in view, and I believe if we do 
we can disarm the opposition that has retarded the participation 
of the federal government down all these decades and all these 
generations. 
If I had time I would trace very briefly—I will not undertake 
to do it—the various impulses in our Legislative history where 
one Congress after another has undertaken to move out upon 
this field of federal aid, and the form in which it has actually 
been extended. But the lateness of the hour and the practical 
nature of the occasion leads me to get down to a direct program 
—suggested program, that I will venture to lay before you to- 
night. 
Federal aid can be divided into two parts,—aid extended 
incidentally by the machinery of government, the existing polit- 
ical machinery of the government, and aid extended direct 
through the action, specific action, of government. We spend a 
thousand million dollars a year upon the machinery of the 
federal government—a billion of dollars! Think what a plant 
that represents! That machinery already includes in its per- 
sonnel highly equipped men and women of great possibilities of 
education that are not being utilized, that can be utilized if our 
attention be directed to the question. 
In my district—the Sixth District of Alabama—we have a 
custom of having an expedition of government experts go
-P-A-G-E-40
40 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
through the district about every second year. The first expedi- 
tion took up the question of plant life, and its application to 
crops. The second expedition took up animal life and its appli- 
cation to live stock, then the combination of the two, the balanc- 
ing of the farm, making farming a scientific profession; and 
the third, which we finished this year, took up home life and the 
wastage of human vitality—the most appalling of all the waste 
of our national resources. Twelve or fifteen hundred deaths 
from typhoid alone preventable in Alabama every year? Thous- 
ands of babies die preventably. The low condition of vitality in 
thousands of cases, due to hook-worm, dysentery, and so on. 
Chills and fever and malaria sapping the vitality, all unneces- 
sary. I saw Dr. Stiles take down one of his charts and say, 
“Look at this. It is a typical photograph of a farmer, his wife 
and five children. The wife looks worn out. Of course she is. 
She has to nurse the sick, as well as take care of the house. The 
five children are sickly. They have the hook-worm. There 
ought to be five other children there. There ought to be ten in 
that family. There were five others, but they are out in the lit- 
tle grave-yard. The man says he hasn’t enough help on the 
farm. Of course he hasn’t. He is advocating sending off and 
bringing in Italians to come in and marry with the negroes. 
Why not preserve the immigration to the skies? If he had his 
five other children he would have all the help he needed. Why 
not have immigration of your own flesh and blood? Why should 
these other five children have died? It was all unnecessary. 
Five are dead, five are sickly—because the man did not build a 
sanitary privy, the cost of which would have been less than the 
cost of one of the coffins.” 
I simply cite that to show you what vital service knowledge 
like that would be to the farmers of the South, the farmers of 
the country. Dr. Stiles is in the government’s employ. Why 
should not he take it up? This heavy loss of vitality and life 
because of the lack of simple precautions! Of course you recog- 
nize the physical limitation upon the spoken word, but there is 
no physical limitation upon the written word. 
To be brief, I would have the Department of Agriculture 
not simply issue technical bulletins, but conduct correspondence 
courses in agriculture, courses adapted to the teachers, to aid 
them in teaching scientific agriculture, and courses available to
-P-A-G-E-41
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 41 
any boy or any man, courses extending over years, so that any 
citizen chould be equipped to become a scientific farmer without 
cost, correspondence courses with the government. 
I would have a Department of Commerce. Conduct courses 
in business, so that any American boy or man, any citizen, could, 
without expense, become equipped for business. I would have a 
Department of Labor conduct courses in the trades or mechan- 
ical arts, so that any wage earner, any boy, could become skilled 
and expert in any trade. 
I would have the diplomatic service and the consular ser- 
vice in all lands gathering up vital information. Why should 
it have been necessary for Prof. Tate to go to Switzerland to 
learn all of this, when the government has a hundred agents in 
Switzerland, and we ought to have known all about the matter, 
lo, these many decades. We ought to know instantly whenever 
any important step in educational progress is made in any land 
under the sun. In our diplomatic and consular service the ma- 
chinery exists. We pay for it. And they should gather informa- 
tion on all these subjects, and report it in constantly to our gov- 
ernment at Washington. By the establishment of a simple 
bureau, even a division under the Commissioner of Education 
would suffice, into which all government agencies are brought, 
and every department of the government would report and pour 
every week, the great facts of the week, and then this division 
with its experts adjust it. Have the public printer print it. 
Have an official journal, say. We have had estimates made, and 
you would be surprised how negligible the cost would be, and 
have Uncle Sam become an educational editor, the greatest the 
world has ever known. Any head of a family could give his 
name to the rural delivery carrier, or give it to the Postmaster, 
and receive the best paper the world has ever seen, as a part of 
the system of education, and it would not amount to one-tenth 
of one per cent., no, not one-hundredth of one per cent, increased 
expenditure. 
I found, for instance, we allot about seventeen millions now, 
it is increasing gradually, a year, to that Agricultural Depart- 
ment. With less than thirty thousand dollars we could establish 
correspondence courses for the Department of Agriculture. Shall 
we not look to the progressive teachers of this Southern Associa- 
tion here, where the demand is so great, where the possibilities
-P-A-G-E-42
42 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
are so numerous, look to them to stand with us, as we try in 
Washington to overcome the load and burden of the reactionary 
past, and turn the machinery of the Federal government into the 
greatest vocational engine of education the world has ever seen? 
(Applause). 
The second part of federal aid is the direct aid to the process 
of regular systematic education. Now I will not go into the de- 
tails of this. The principle applies to education in every form, 
general, as well as vocational. But you will find this, if you will 
study the history of federal aid, you will find that the line of least 
resistance to get federal aid, and to establish the principle of fed- 
eral aid in the public schools, the common schools, will be voca- 
tional aid. I will not stop to demonstrate that, but I cite that to 
have you realize why I have limited this treatment solely to voca- 
tional education. It is not that I do not feel that better general 
education in the common schools for the several states is not 
needed. What I am trying to do now in this document is to find 
practically the line of least resistance, and leave with you tonight 
some simple concrete suggestions as a suggestive basis for federal 
aid. 
I have introduced three bills in the House of Representa- 
tives, looking to this end. I will not attempt to discuss these bills 
in full, but will simply call them to your attention, and point out 
the purpose and then request your consideration in future, merely 
upon the suggestive point of view upon which to build some form 
of federal aid which the teachers of America will support, and 
for which they will create public opinion, and then we can get the 
aid in a reasonable length of time. I sent word to my secretary 
in the State of Alabama to have the secretary in Washington to 
send you some copies of these bills, but they have not come yet, 
but they will, and I hope you will be kind enough to distribute 
them among the teachers before they leave. The first bill is to 
Encourage, Equalize and Standardize Vocational Education 
Among the Several States. Now “equalize” and “standardize.” 
Investigation in certain practical fields in this country show that 
if a boy goes to school until he is fourteen years of age only, at 
the age of twenty-five he will be earning $2.00 a day, on the aver- 
age; but if he goes to school until he is sixteen years of age, he 
will be earning $4.00 on an average. The boy that goes until he 
is sixteen is not in the same class with the boy that only went
-P-A-G-E-43
    
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 43 
until he was fourteen. There is not equality of opportunity be- 
tween the two boys. If you are going to have democracy, if you 
are going to have industrial justice, equality of opportunity, you 
must equalize educational advantages. 
If a boy goes to common school only, he will have only one 
chance in nine thousand of becoming one of the ten thousand 
leaders in his day and generation. But if he goes through high 
school he will have one chance in four hundred. If he goes 
through college, he will have one chance in forty—his oppor- 
tunity is increased yet tenfold more. Ninety-seven per cent. of 
the American people do not get a chance to go beyond the com- 
mon school. So the average boy, bright as he may be—97% only 
get a chance at the common school. Here is a boy, one of the 3%, 
who gets a chance to go to college, no brighter than the first boy, 
no better blood in his veins, yet, here is this democracy, supposed 
to be founded upon the principle of equality or opportunity, when 
these two young citizens start out down the road of life that sec- 
ond boy has 220 times the chance the first boy has of the highest 
opportunities to become a leader in his day and generation. In 
other words, the door to highest opportunity is locked in the face 
of 97% of our people, because of inequalities in educational ad- 
vantages. You can never have a true democracy until you equal- 
ize the educational advantages of the children. 
Here is the bill: 
A BILL 
To Encourage, Equalize and Standardize Vocational Education Among the 
Several States, 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the United States Commis- 
sioner of Education is hereby authorized to co-operate with the State Super- 
intendent of Education of any State in making a joint education survey of 
the State or any subdivision thereof or of any school district or municipality, 
said survey to include the preparation of programs, plans, specifications 
and estimates of cost for establishing and maintaining in adequate num- 
bers schools with courses of vocational instruction conforming to standards 
prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior: Provided, That the amount 
expended by the Commissioner of Education on any survey shall not exceed 
one-half of the total cost of said survey. 
Sec, 2. That whenever any State or subdivision thereof or any munici- 
pality or school district shall duly authorize the building or equipment of a 
school in carrying out any survey made in pursuance of the provisions of 
section one, and approved by the Secretary of the Interior, then the Secre- 
tary of the Interior is hereby authorized to pay one-third of the total cost
-P-A-G-E-44
  44 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
of such building or equipment, payments to be made at such times and 
under such regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe: 
Provided, That before making any payment the Secretary of the Interior 
shall be satisfied that after the completion of said building or equipment 
the same will be employed each year for standard courses of vocational 
instruction for standard lengths of terms as prescribed by the survey pro- 
vided for in section one. 
Here is a thought to start you. You must find out what the 
condition is. We have a geological survey, so that we can intelli- 
gently locate the rock. We ought to have an educational survey. 
The child is worth more than the rocks. That survey should be 
maintained constantly, for this great nation, showing the condi- 
tion of education everywhere. It should show the educational 
conditions in each county, to start with, and just how that county 
ought to proceed, the cost of it, the equipment of the schools, and 
so on, to reach a standard. Then the federal government, under 
this by-law, and I think it is equitable, should bear one-half of the 
cost of the surveys, Then when any state, any county, will pro- 
ceed to develop its educational institutions according to this chart, 
then the federal government under that bill is authorized to bear 
one-third of the cost, the idea being that the state will bear one- 
third, the county and school district between them will bear the 
other third. So the school district would only have to levy tax 
for one-sixth of the cost, and the poorest school district in the 
land can bear that much of a burden. It would put it within the 
reach of every school district in America to initiate a movement 
to bring about, in a reasonable length of time, a high standard of 
education for its children. 
I want to point out the fact that the Bill does not have any 
provision for the federal government participating in the main- 
tenance of the schools after they have been developed. I have 
introduced a second bill that deals with that matter, and perhaps 
this may be the line of least resistance. I hope the faithful teach- 
ers will study and advise as to which line they would believe it 
best to follow, or whether we had better try to follow both lines, 
in actually getting something done by the federal government. 
This is a bill to promote rural education in the several states. I 
am particularly gratified that this description of the schools of 
Switzerland has preceded it. This is largely founded upon the 
schools of Switzerland. This is not a long bill. I will read:
-P-A-G-E-45
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 45 
A BILL 
To Provide an Education Survey of the United States. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the United States Commis- 
sioner of Education, under the general direction of the Secretary of the 
Interior, is hereby authorized and directed to make and maintain a general 
education survey of the United States and its possessions. 
Sec, 2. That the said Commissioner of Education is hereby authorized 
to co-operate with education officials of States, Territories and localities to 
make detailed education surveys: Provided, That in such cases the State or 
locality in question shall bear one-half of the expense. 
Of course these matters are subject to adjustment, but I be- 
lieve in some way these various sections have the germ, of per- 
haps the line of least resistance along which we can get this prac- 
tical coéperation of the federal government in the shortest time. 
I will add that I think the report of Dr. Tate is the foundation of 
this bill, that Dr. Claxton described the school largely as has been 
described here tonight, and referred to this report, which had not 
yet been made, but he referred to it in one of the meetings. While 
I did not have a chance to confer with him fully, I am convinced 
that the sections of the bill as drawn would put into practical 
form his conception. I don’t want to speak for him, but when he 
does come I hope you will ask him to take that up, and refer to it. 
But I believe it will come pretty near to his conception of a 
school, where the teacher will be the leader, and that while we 
would not have legislation limited to classes, yet it is toward the 
rural schools, the country schools, that this line of first aid from 
the federal government should be directed. 
Indeed, there is one more bill I have—I will not read it, I will 
not keep you longer at this late hour. It is a bill which is not 
ripe yet to be passed, but after we have educated the American 
people to get away from the old stand-pat reactionary ideas of the 
federal government, to the point where they realize that the gov- 
ernment exists for the people, not the people for the government, 
that it exists to promote the highest welfare of all its citizens, 
and not as a piece of arbitrary political machinery to be discussed 
with hair-splitting arguments as to constitutionality of the law— 
when we get to that conception of our government, then we will 
be able, I believe, to have the federal government do more than 
aid, do more than stimulate. We will have it actually able to 
harmonize and coérdinate all the educational agencies of the na-
-P-A-G-E-46
  46 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
tion, and that is the effect, tentatively to put into a suggestive 
form the conception how, under the federal system, we could 
have the federal government bring about this codrdination and 
coéperation of all the agencies. 
We make it elementary education, for that is where the 
greatest need is felt, and that is where the government has always 
neglected to give any aid at all. A charter body is created, called 
an Elementary Educational Foundation, and that chartered body 
may be made up of sixteen members, each of whom are ex-officio 
members, the United States Commissioner of Education, and the 
cabinet officers and the head officers of the great National Educa- 
tional Association, and then eight chosen, being those who will 
become this Board of Trustees, and will be on certain boards. 
The federal government will start out by giving the nucleus 
for a foundation. This bill does not carry it, for the reason that 
in the House of Representatives our Educational Committee has 
been practically relieved of its power and vitality by not being 
allowed to have any appropriation. If a bill carries any appro- 
priation of money it can not go to the Educational Committee. 
Anything that pertains to agriculture, or to the Naval Depart- 
ment, or other departments, can carry an appropriation, but if a 
bill should carry an appropriation it can not go to the Educational 
Committee. This should be changed. One of the regrets of my 
experience has been that the Democratic caucus, on account of so 
many young members coming in, new members, passed a resolu- 
tion, it was a just resolution, I did not oppose it, that a member 
on any one of the great committees, fourteen in number, should 
not hold a commission on any other committee. I would have 
been chairman of the Educational Committee, I have been wait- 
ing for four years to reach that position, so I could start out and 
begin to demand recognition of that committee. But being on the 
Naval Committee, and my first duty I felt was there where our 
great naval appropriation bill has to be drawn up every year, 
and I am on a sub-committee to draw it up, I had to give up the 
Educational Committee, and I never had such a disappointment, 
such a wrench of the heart in my life. But, Mr. President, I 
don’t know what the fates have in store for me, but they can’t stop 
my taking part in the educational work of my country while I 
am alive. (Applause). And if the fates are favorable and the 
stars have the right conjunction, I hope, before very many
-P-A-G-E-47
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 47 
months, to be on the Committee of Education, of the United 
States Senate, and I hope to be the president of it some day, and 
that is my highest prospective ambition in the matter of the com- 
mittee. Now this does not carry the appropriation, but here would 
be the conception if it did,—that the federal government would 
start with a million dollars, if you wish, and let that run for fifty 
consecutive years, but, in addition to that, start with an element 
of a fraction from the proceeds that come from the public domain. 
Do not forget that because I have not gone into the history of 
education in the South that there has been favorable considera- 
tion. Henry Clay was the first one to bring it forward, to have a 
part of the public domain allotted to the purpose of public educa- 
tion, but this is something that has never materialized, though 
favorable consideration has often been given it. Now we still 
have Alaska and other things, that should give large funds, public 
funds from public domains, and we ought to set apart a fraction 
—I will not say what, but we should put aside a fraction to be put 
aside for purposes of education. As long as the human race re- 
produces itself this need will exist, and this money should not be 
run through. Any state might contribute a part, and when it 
contributes, the proceeds could be confined to the limits of the 
state, and any philanthropist who contributes, if he desired, could 
make provisions as he saw fit. The fund must develop to be cov- 
ered into the treasury as a loan to the United States, drawing 5% 
interest. A precedent exists in the history of the House of Rep- 
resentatives for just such a foundation. Now this loan, growing 
continually year by year, would be eternal. It would be adminis- 
tered by the Board. It should be embodied in the charter that 
the board would not be given any authority to convey this, so you 
see we could meet all objections of the states’ rights, for the 
charter would not give the board any authority to enter a state, 
except upon codperation, upon invitation of the state authorities. 
But in my judgment the second bill is along the line of least 
resistance, to establish the Board of Rural Education in several 
states, and to establish these community schools as models, as 
demonstration schools, to extend then, further, to the other 
schools of the county. 
Then, too, bear in mind all the time that we should not be 
satisfied until the federal government, through this charter board 
or some other agency, has brought, not only itself in all of its 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
    48 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
departments and all of its machinery, yes, and its own funds, but 
has brought the states, the counties, the school districts, the phi- 
lanthropical societies,—bring them all together, working toward 
the survey, in the shortest time establishing a great national 
system uniform through the nation. 
My friends, the chairman was kind, who referred to that 
Spanish war, but let me tell you, there wasn’t much fighting in 
that war. Our fathers used to get up and do more real fighting 
before breakfast than we did in that whole Spanish war, all put 
together. So far as I am concerned, it is not my ambition to rest 
any claim to fame upon that war. But this I do say, that we 
should see to it that our navy is in such shape that in case of 
need it would prove of service,—I feel that in urging this I am 
but doing my duty to my country, and I will continue to urge my 
countrymen, irrespective of how much abuse I may get for it, the 
importance of due consideration of this vital question. We are 
living in an armed world, whether we like it or not. I have lived 
in Europe. I have lived in Asia. Thirty-two millions of men 
have their bayonets fixed tonight. We do not want to have trou- 
ble, we do not want to have to get up similar military systems, to 
make us military. But we have got to do a little something. We 
have got to put property on the ocean—a good fleet. A good bat- 
tleship will save 50,000 men. And be just the cost of the locks 
upon the door. We have to do a little something. It is wise and 
prudent and patriotic that we should permanently maintain on 
the Atlantic and on the Pacific a good, efficient, up-to-date navy, 
so that we can live in peace and security; so that we can exercise 
our institutions in our own country as we see fit. So that a for- 
eign military power could not come down to a city in America, 
like they did at San Francisco, and order the white people to put 
yellow children in the same schools with the white children, 
whether they wish to do it or not, interfere with the police regu- 
lations or rights of self-government. With an adequate navy we 
could live in peace and security and self-respect. We could carry 
on this great constructive work of education, religion and com- 
merce and industry, work out our vision as to our nation’s great- 
est good, without molestation from without. That is wise and 
prudent—but that is not my ambition. 
The greatest thing in this world is character. Nature is try- 
ing to develop character. She is not trying to develop a race of
-P-A-G-E-49
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 49 
  physical giants. You are about the same size your ancestors were 
a few years ago. It is in the upper part of the brain, the gray 
matter on the surface of the convolutions,—it is in that part of 
the brain that nature builds, and from generation to generation 
adds additional cells, and upon that part of the brain is the seat 
of character. Nature is trying to produce an ever higher, nobler 
race of manhood. The development of nobler men and women is 
the greatest thing in the world. That is the object of nature, the 
will of God. It should be the prime object of government. And 
when you come to study it, if you want to get a maximum of re- 
turn for a given outlay of effort, then apply it at the plastic 
period. In other words, my friends, you hold in your hand the 
responsibility, and the glorious privilege, of being able to give the 
maximum useful service contribution in your day and generation 
to the welfare of humanity, because you have man at the plastic 
age. My highest ambition is to take a little part, and, Mr. Chair- 
man, won’t you let me help whenever I can, won’t you let me fit 
in somewhere with you in your work? My highest ambition is to 
take my little part in my day and generation to help bring about, 
in the shortest time, the development of a great national system 
of education, so that hereafter, when a boy is born—yes, it 
touches my heart, because, when I go back in my district, the 
farmers way back in the country, to see them growing up, old 
Anglo-Saxon blood, the finest foundation in the world, growing 
up in ignorance—so that, in the future, when a boy is born away 
back in the sticks, he won’t find a wall around him, but he would 
find the doors of highest opportunity thrown wide. When he 
looks up he can see the sun pass across the face of the heavens, 
the stars and their distant forces, and his young spirit could 
arise, on the wings of education, and soar, with a nobler ambition 
of service in his day and generation, without limit, to the widest 
horizon. 
I believe I could die happy if, when I look out for the last 
time through the window, realizing that it is the last time I shall 
see the light of day,—I believe I could die happy if I felt that in 
my day and generation I had striven and done my little best to 
bring about such a condition that I would know that in the fu- 
ture I need have no misgiving for my country. And if we havea 
high standard of education for the American people you need not 
fear that liberty and her institutions shall perish upon the earth. 
I could die happy if I could take my part in bringing about this 4  
-P-A-G-E-50
  50 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
end. That is what I covet. And it nerves me when I fight for the 
opportunity to take part in developing a great national system 
which I would know to the end of time would guarantee that 
every boy and every girl born under the American flag shall have 
the advantages, the development of a high system of education. 
I thank you. (Applause). 
THE CHAIR: I am sure every delegate present joins me in 
thanking our distinguished visitor for his presence and his words 
here this evening. Now just one word of warning,—do not for- 
get our splendid opportunity tomorrow to visit the great old 
educational institution here, but be present at 9 o’clock tomorrow 
morning at Vanderbilt University. 
(Adjourned). 
FRIDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1913. 9:30 A. M. 
VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY. 
THE CHAIR: The hour has arrived for the morning session 
of the Convention, and before we begin our regular work, I am 
sure you will be glad to hear a five minute announcement from 
Mr. Ogden, representing a great movement. 
Mr. OGDEN: I have been permitted to speak for five min- 
utes in the interest of the American Association for the Advance- 
ment of Science, which meets this year at Atlanta, from Decem- 
ber 29 to January 3. It is unnecessary, I am sure, to expatiate at 
any length regarding the nature of this Association, and the im- 
portance of this gathering for the South. 
The American Association, which was founded in 1848, has 
had a steady and continuous growth among the men and women 
interested in the advancement of science since that date until 
now it numbers in its membership over eight thousand, among 
whom are to be found all the leading scientists of our country. 
The meeting which occurs this year in the South is one to 
which we ought all to be ready and anxious to give our hearty 
support. Although there are about eight thousand members of 
this Association, only some seven per cent. of them are resident 
in the Southern territory. The meeting coming to Atlanta gives 
us an opportunity to identify ourselves with this great movement, 
and to lend it our support. We wish to demonstrate to the coun-
-P-A-G-E-51
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 51 
try at large when these scientists come as our guests into our 
midst that the South takes no backward place in the cause for 
which this Association stands. 
But I wish to speak to you particularly this morning with 
reference to the Department of Education. The Association is 
organized in eleven sections, representing diversified interests of 
modern science, and among these is the section for education, 
which is one of the most progressive and vigorous sections with- 
in the Association. But I find, in going over the membership 
lists of the Southern territory, that there are comparatively few 
educators in the South enrolled in the American Association. 
Now inasmuch as the educational movement in the South is gen- 
erally recognized to be the greatest educational movement in this 
country today, it seems to me that we ought to rally to the sup- 
port of this section, and demonstrate its movement at the Atlanta 
meeting. The educational section this year is presided over by 
Commissioner Claxton, which is evidence enough to you of the 
type of meeting which it will be, and I am sure, for that reason, 
among others, you will be ready and willing to offer your support 
on that occasion. We wish to have at Atlanta the best meeting 
which the Association has ever had. The average attendance at 
this Association’s meetings has been in the neighborhood of 
about two thousand. Now with only about 600 members in 
the South we must have more, if we are going to have at Atlanta 
the kind of meeting which the Association usually has when it 
meets in various sections of the country in the North and East. 
While the Association numbers, as I have said, primarily, 
men engaged in active research in various fields, it also desires 
to number among its membership those who are interested in 
the movement, and I would be glad to recommend for member- 
ship the names of any of those who are now present who are 
interested in the movement, and would be glad to enroll as mem- 
bers. I have with me a number of membership cards, and shall 
be glad to have you take these and consider seriously member- 
ship in the Association. 
I feel that in speaking in behalf of the American Association 
no apology is needed, for the Association is distinct among all 
other associations in this country, and its position is so thor- 
oughly assured that it does not seem to be necessary to make any 
special pleadings in its behalf. I therefore hope, in extending
-P-A-G-E-52
  52 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
you this invitation to attend the meeting in Atlanta, and urging 
you to codperate in making it a success, I am bringing to some of 
you news of which you are already aware, and to others simply 
make you alive to the fact that in Atlanta we will be entertain- 
ing a large body of scientists from all over the country, and I 
therefore ask your hearty coéperation in this matter and in this 
movement, and also ask those of you who are here now to speak 
to others about it who are not here, and also to those at your 
homes who are interested in such matters, so that when the 
association meets in Atlanta success will be assured, and we can 
hope to bring the association back to Atlanta at intervals. 
THE CHAIR: There has been much said in recent years 
about waste in education. The first topic will concern that sub- 
ject, and we shall now hear from Dr. J. W. Fertig, of the Middle 
Tennessee State Normal School, “Is not a six-year course of 
study preferable for the elementary schools?” 
IS NOT A SIX-YEAR ELEMENTARY COURSE 
PREFERABLE? 
DR. J. W. FERTIG. 
At the outset the author of this paper wishes to make clear 
that it is not the purpose of the paper to add another to the 
many recent criticisms of the public schools with which we are 
all familiar. On the contrary, the writer believes that the public 
schools are doing a great work surprisingly well when we con- 
sider the large number of pupils and the small per capita cost. 
Recent comparisons of the work of students in the leading Uni- 
versities of the country prove beyond question that those who 
come from the public schools have excelled in every particular 
those from the private schools and endowed academies. This is 
true in spite of certain defects in the public school organization. 
Whatever is said of the nature of fault-finding is said for the pur- 
pose of pointing out a remedy rather than for the purpose of 
calling attention to the defects. 
The one weak point in our present organization is the failure 
to provide adequately for early adolescents, pupils from 12 to 15 
years of age. Pupils of the 7th, 8th and 9th grade have much 
more in common with those above than those below and they 
should be grouped with the former and treated like them. To 
do this it is proposed to extend the high school organization 
downward to include the upper elementary grades. Some have
-P-A-G-E-53
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 53 
  formed a new organization variously termed Intermediate 
school or Junior high school for the 7th, 8th and 9th grades in 
which the work now done is thoroughly reorganized and re- 
distributed so as to better meet the needs of the pupils. For 
reasons given later the writer favors the proposed changes. 
Having thus provided against the possibility of being mis- 
understood on this point, I shall enter immediately into the 
subject. In order that you may follow the paper more readily, 
I wish to say that the paper is divided into two main divisions, 
the first dealing with the criticisms of the present plan, the sec- 
ond with the advantageous results of the proposed changes. 
Most people think of the elementary school as something 
definite and fixed, but a survey of the United States shows this 
to be far from true. It is, in fact, a variable quantity. In some 
places it means six years of work, in others seven, eight or nine 
years of work, the number of years in every case being deter- 
mined by accident or imitation rather than by plan or princi- 
ple. In two states the authorities have adopted a six-year 
course; the New England States have generally a nine-year 
course; the West and Central West an eight-year course, and 
the Southern States a seven-year course. But in almost every 
state in the Union it is possible to find instances of each type 
of school. Stranger than this is the fact that apparently each 
type of school is assumed to do essentially the same work, for 
the four-year high school course superposed in every case, con- 
tains practically the same work both in kind and amount. We 
have standardized the college and the high school, can we do 
the same for the elementary school? In the words of Dr. Rice, 
“Until an accurate standard is recognized, ward politicians will 
continue to wield the baton, and educational anarchy will pre- 
vail.” We must not only determine a standard of efficiency but 
we must also determine the amount of time and the method by 
which this standard may be reached. To agree upon a definite 
number of years of work is in effect the establishment of such 
a standard. It is hoped that this discussion will aid in the es- 
tablishment of a course of uniform length. Believing that a 
shorter course would mean a better defined course, the writer 
favors a six-year, elementary course followed by the Junior high 
school. 
But before we enter upon a discussion of the advantages 
of a six-year elementary course, it will help to clarify the pres-  
-P-A-G-E-54
  
  54 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
ent situation if we briefly trace the origin and growth of public 
schools in the United States. 
Historically education systems have developed from .the 
top downward. The University was the first educational in- 
stitution organized and each school of lower grade has in turn 
been determined by the one next above, rather than by the 
needs of its own members who have come up from below. This 
general rule had its first exception in the organization of the 
German Folk Schulen, when the Lutheran Reformation laid 
down the principle that the reading of the Bible was necessary 
to salvation. The writing and reckoning schools of Massachu- 
setts, to which our American system is traceable, are copies of 
these German Folk Schulen, and like the latter covered only 
six years of work. They were intended for the children of the 
poor who meant to go no farther. Private academies were 
provided for the children of the well-to-do, who wanted to go 
to college. 
With the decay of the academies, the public schools, still 
consisting of only six years of work, took over the work of 
secondary instruction. Grade after grade was added to meet 
local demands, until the gap between the elementary school 
and the college was bridged. These added grades, however, 
did not resemble our present high school, for no difference was 
made between them and the lower grades in organization, dis- 
cipline or methods of instruction. 
Gradually, however, the upper grades took on a separate 
organization; but in the separation the line of cleavage was not 
at the end of the sixth year as it should have been, nor was 
there uniformity as to where it occurred. In the Hast nine 
grades were left in the elementary school, in the West only 
eight, the shorter course in the West being determined, appar- 
ently, by lack of funds, just as later a seven-year elementary 
course was established in the South for the same reason. 
From what has been said, it ought to be clear to all that no 
principle was employed in the present organization of our ele- 
mentary schools, but that whim, chance and necessity were the 
determining factors. Like Topsy, our system just “growed.” 
Not only was it not planned, but it is equally clear that no sane 
person would today propose such an arrangement if it were not 
already in existence. An eight or nine-year elementary course
-P-A-G-E-55
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 55 
with a four-year high school superposed has the sanction of 
neither history, logic nor psychology. Nothing like the Amer- 
ican high school or the American elementary school is found 
elsewhere in the world. 
Objections to the public school system are not at all of 
recent origin. The first formal statement of criticism, sup- 
posedly by competent authority, was the now famous Report 
of the Committee of Ten in 1893, of which President Eliot was 
chairman. The committee found the schools effected with the 
dry-rot of formalism and proposed to cure the evil by enrich- 
ing the curriculum by introducing certain new branches as well 
as some from the high school, such as Latin and algebra. Six 
years later the Committee of Thirteen undertook a further in- 
vestigation and in its report proposed a unified six-year high 
school course as the cure for the evils it found. But both of 
these committees were more concerned with the reforms of the 
high school as a college preparatory than with the improvement 
of the elementary school or the public school course as a whole. 
Consequently they have had little influence with public school 
men. 
At the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, however, there was 
an educational exhibit that made clear two things: first, that 
the American boys are two years behind those of other coun- 
tries; second, that America alone of all the great countries has 
an eight-year elementary school. At the next meeting of the 
National Educational Association a committee was appointed 
to consider and report upon these facts. This committee and 
its successors reported in 1907 and subsequent years to the 
effect that the eight-year elementary course is the principle 
eause of the loss of time by American pupils, as well as the 
source of other evils, and recommended as a cure for all these 
a six-year elementary school, followed by a six-year high school, 
either with a unified course, or with junior and senior divisions. 
Rapid progress in the re-organization of the schools dates 
from these reports. The recommendations of the committees 
have been put into practical operation in many places. The 
Board of Regents of New York state was the first state authority 
to take favorable action on the proposed change. In 1910 the 
Regents published their first “Six-year course of study for ele- 
mentary schools,” which Dr. DeGarmo has characterized as the 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
56 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
“Declaration of Independence in Education.” The course for 
the seventh and eighth grades was published separately and 
these grades were called the Intermediate school. Many cities 
within the state have since organized these as part of the high 
school. A year later, Massachusetts took similar action and 
recommended similar changes. In the West, the local authori- 
ties have not waited for the sanction of the state authorities 
but have undertaken the reorganization on their own initiative. 
In these states a score or more of cities have already carried 
into effect the proposed reorganization and as many more are 
working toward it and will soon put it in operation. 
Let us look for a moment at the criticisms of our system 
specified in these reports against our present system. The fol- 
lowing are among the more important: 
1. Our present organization fails to make clear a specific 
task for either the elementary school or the high school. 
2. The break between the elementary school and the high 
school is too sudden and too complete, and is ill-timed both as 
to the mental development of the pupils and as to the subject- 
matter of the course of study. : 
8. The curriculum is hopelessly congested and lacks se- 
quence. 
4. Our present system unnecessarily complicates disci- 
pline; renders poor teaching in the upper grades unavoidable; 
and is wasteful both of teaching-force and of material equip- 
ment, especially in the upper grades. These criticisms have 
struck a responsive chord in the hearts of practical schoolmen, 
for it is undoubtedly true that the point attacked by these criti- 
cisms, namely, the seventh, eighth and ninth grades, is the 
source of the largest part of the friction met with in school ad- 
ministration. Let us consider these criticisms in some detail. 
1. What is the task of the elementary school? Who knows? 
To quote Dr. Rice: “If we have no definite goal who can tell 
how long it will take us to reach it, or what road we must take?” 
“If we do not agree upon satisfactory results, how shall we be 
able to tell when our task is satisfactorily performed?” Some 
would say that the task of the elementary school is to impart the 
school arts, the three R’s. But if that is our task we are giving 
more time to it than is required to perform it. Eight years of 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 57 
continual drill on these subjects with emphasis on the form 
rather than on the content is not only a waste of time but has a 
positive tendency to dwarf the pupil’s mental growth. Much 
has been said of late about standard tests in the grades. One 
thing at least has been made clear by these, namely, the results 
obtained in the grades is in no sense commensurate with the 
amount of time and drill given. If we seek a wider task for the 
elementary school and shift the emphasis from form to content, 
we obtain better results, but in doing so we overstep the bound- 
ary and encroach upon the special field of the high school. It 
was the practice of doing this by some that led Dr. Dewey to say: 
“The high school begins at no point and ends at none,” for it is 
forced to share its work with the elementary school below and 
the college above. i 
As to the charge that the break between the elementary and 
high schools is too sudden and too complete, all will agree that 
the charge is well founded. At present, the pupils of the eighth 
grade are treated much like pupils of the lower grades and are 
taught by the same methods. After the lapse of a summer vaca- 
tion they are sent to another building, in a remote part of town 
perhaps, with new associates, are given entirely new subjects of 
study, are put in charge of no one in particular but taught by 
several new teachers and are required to prepare lessons for a 
recitation period of twice the former length. In short, they are 
expected to change over summer from children to men and 
women. Without doubt, many fail to respond to the demand 
and drop out of school, who would succeed and remain in, if only 
the change were more gradual. In the proposed reorganization 
the break would come before the old familiar subjects are 
dropped, and a large part of the heavy mortality now found in 
the first high-school year would thereby be prevented. 
That the break is ill-timed, when considered from the point 
of view of the pupil’s mental development, is made perfectly 
clear when we recall the vagaries and hallucinations of the ado- 
lescent. To set the pupil adrift in the midst of this period is a 
serious mistake. Then he is possessed by a longing for individual 
liberty, and the desire to go into the world and work with men. 
He is under the influence of that inner disturbance which tends 
to make every youth prodigal of his opportunities until he has 
squandered them all and at last come to himself. Our present 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  58 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
plan makes it especially easy for the pupil to leave school at the 
end of the eighth grade, and this is all the more true when we 
by formal exercises and the presentation of a certificate give 
him the impression that he has completed a course of study 
worth while. To put him into the high school two years earlier 
and thus gradually familiarize him with the conditions, customs 
and ideals of secondary school work before adolescence has turned 
his thoughts from school and while the compulsory attendance 
law is still operative to keep him in school for two or more 
years, would without doubt prevent the break that now comes 
between the eighth and ninth years and the heavy mortality that 
now unavoidably results from this break. 
This break is equally ill-timed with respect to the course of 
study. The logical point for this differentiation is the beginning 
of the seventh year—the beginning, not the end of adolescence. 
Dr. Ayres has shown clearly that retardation and elimination are 
most prevalent at this time, when the pupil is required to take 
up, to quote him, “a continuation of a wearyingly monotonous 
curriculum.” This cannot be otherwise than destructive of in- 
terest. To place the division where it is, is wrong for the pupil 
who drops out at the end of the elementary course for he gets 
little that is new after the sixth grade. It is equally bad for 
those who go on into the high school. The beginning of the sev- 
enth year is the logical and the psychological time for the be- 
ginning of secondary education and this is the point where it is 
begun in all other progressive countries, except Germany, where 
it is begun a year or two earlier. To place the break in the 
14th or 15th year as at present, is especially bad in those states 
where the compulsory attendance law covers the 16th year. 
This last year is spent in high school under protest and with 
only bad results for all concerned. 
The proposed changes would be of great benefit to consoli- 
dated rural schools. Many such schools now stop at the end of 
the eighth year when their resources would warrant them in 
adding another year. To add another year under present prac- 
tice would be worth but little; but another year added to the 
seventh and eighth and the whole reorganized and unified would 
be worth more than any previous year. A six-year elementary 
course with the necessary and proposed reorganization would 
hasten the work of consolidation for large as well as small 
schools.

- The charge of a congested elementary curriculum is no new 
one and some of us are ready to admit that it is only too true. 
The schools of today have inherited from those of an earlier 
time, attended largely by young men and women, a mass of ma- 
terial unsuited to the needs and abilities of children. In the 
effort to teach this to children we go contrary to nature, giving 
what requires the exercise of the logical faculty before the fac- 
ulty has developed, and what requires the largest outlay of the 
power of memory after it has past its zenith. In the words of 
the Morrison Report: “Much is learned today with infinite 
pains, which, if left to tomorrow, would be acquired uncon- 
sciously and without effort.” But to do otherwise seems to be 
impossible without a reorganization of the entire system. 
In addition to this mass of material inherited from past 
curricula, many new subjects have been added, without any at- 
tempt to organize and correlate the whole. In most cases the 
lack of training on the part of grade teachers precludes such 
reorganization. The task to many seems hopeless and they are 
crying out against “fads and frills” and are demanding a return 
to the curriculum of the “three R’s.” The solution of the matter, 
however, is not the return to the three R’s, but such a differen- 
tiation and reorganization of the entire public school course as 
will allow every child to pursue work suited to his individual 
tastes and capacities. 
It is further charged that good teaching is practically im- 
possible in the 7th and 8th grades if the grade organization is 
maintained. That this is generally true goes without saying. 
We are at present requiring more work of teachers of these 
grades than they can possibly do well. They simply cannot, in 
the larger number of subjects, make daily preparation adequate 
to the needs of pupils well taught up to these grades. Depart- 
mental teaching is necessary to the maintenance of a high order 
of teaching in the upper grades. A poor teacher in a grade 
under the grade organization means a year lost to all the pupils, 
since all the work will be properly done. Under departmental 
teaching the evil is in part counteracted by the good work of 
others. The loss of a year in the lower grades is bad enough— 
in the upper grades it is far worse. Of course departmental 
teaching could be introduced in the grades without the proposed 
reorganization but it is something foreign to our present system 
and practice.
-P-A-G-E-60
  
  60 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
The final charge is that our present system is wasteful both 
of teaching force and of material equipment. It is wasteful of 
teaching force because the classes in the upper grades are usu- 
ally very small and the per capita cost is correspondingly high. 
It is wasteful of resources for the same reason.. As a matter of 
fact, the cost of equipping a small school for industrial work is 
prohibitive. The proposed reorganization would make possible 
such equipment at central points where a large number of 
pupils can be housed together and the plant used by all the pupils 
from the sixth grade up. It is only by such a plan that indus- 
trial work will ever be successfully incorporated in the course of 
study in the rural schools. 
That the lack of a proper articulation of the elementary and 
high schools is regarded as the weakest point in our present sys- 
tem is proved conclusively by the large number of articles aimed 
at this point published in the recent numbers of the educational 
journals. The following is a partial list of those that have ap- 
peared within the last two months: 
From the Educational Review: “Vocational Education for 
Rural Schools,” J. J. Marian. “Statistics as to Over-age 
Pupils,” Supt. Maxwell. “The Need for Vocational Schools,” 
E. G. Cooley. “Retardation and Elimination in Public Schools,” 
E. F. Ewing. “The Gap Between the Elementary and the Sec- 
ondary Schools,” Theresa L. Wilson. 
From Religious Education: “Do High Schools Need Recon- 
struction?” W. C. Bagley and Edward Rynearson. 
From Journal of Education: “Reorganization of Secondary 
Education,” Frank Leavitt. 
From Psychological Clinic: “Curriculum Making,” W. E. 
Grady. 
From Vocational Education: “An Undemocratic Proposal,” 
Dewey. 
From School Review: “Economy in Education,” Pres. Jud- 
son. 
From Elementary School Teacher: “Seven, Eight and Nine 
Grades in Elementary Schools” (two articles), E. C. Brooks. 
In all of these articles one will find much that will bear upon 
the present discussion. 
Before this paper was begun the writer sent a letter to a 
score or more of school superintendents who have reorganized
-P-A-G-E-61
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 61 
their schools in accordance with the proposed plan, and asked 
for a statement of the results of such reorganization. Their re- 
plies are in my hands, and I assure you they make highly inter- 
esting reading. I wish I might read them all, but time will per- 
mit only a few quotations from them. From Supt. Peter Oleson, 
Cloquet, Minn., comes a statement of the changes he has made in 
the course of study and which shows how industrial work has 
been introduced in the seventh year and above. 
From Supt. Frost, Muskegon, Mich., I quote the following: 
“The plan has been successful in keeping children in school, 
as courses can be offered suited to their needs. They get 
started on the high school course during the time they are under 
the compulsory school law, therefore, they are more apt to re- 
main in school. In fact, I think that one of the greatest ad- 
vantages is the fact that a larger number remain in school 
throughout the high school course.” 
Prin. Ernest P. Wiles, Evansville, Ind., says: “There is 
no doubt in my mind but what the Junior high school idea is a 
splendid solution of our problems, both in the secondary school 
and in the later years of the elementary school. My whole 
thought about the plan is that we should do something to create 
an entirely different sort of atmosphere about the early ado- 
lescent years. The secondary school as now organized, in spite 
of all we can do, is a foreign institution to many boys and girls. 
In many instances neither father, mother, nor brothers and sis- 
ters have ever attended the high school. They look upon it as 
an institution a long way off and they think of it as a world 
very different from the world they know in the grades. I ean’t 
help thinking that many that drop out at the end of the seventh 
or eighth grade do so because of this very fact. Now, by bring- 
ing them in contact with secondary educational ideals and cus- 
toms and atmosphere, we make them a part of the secondary 
school before they are aware of it, and I believe that time will 
prove that many of these pupils will be saved to the school sys- 
tem that under the old organization were lost.” .... 
“|... Not many years ago we used to hear much of the 
‘average’ pupil. In these latter days we have come to learn that 
there is no such thing. . . . Now we speak of the pupil as an in- 
dividual. . . . It is the duty of every teacher to so direct the 
activities of this individual pupil that his peculiar need will be
-P-A-G-E-62
  
  62 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
supplied. It is thé business of education to see that this indi- 
vidual is fitted to take his place in society and contribute his 
part of the world’s work. .. . The whole Junior high school idea 
is an outgrowth of this individual conception of education. It 
is an attempt to handle some of the pressing educational prob- 
lems scientifically. It is pretty well agreed that our present 
system of education needs reorganizing. ... We are aware that 
there has existed for many years a gap between the grades and 
the high school—a gap which many educators by divers meth- 
ods have tried to bridge with little or no success. The Junior 
high school is a scheme to fill this gap rather than to bridge it. 
The transition from elementary to secondary education should 
be as easy and as natural as the transition from one grade to 
another in either the grades or the high school.” 
From Supt. M. C. James, Berkeley, Cal., comes a lengthy 
statement and courses of study. One may get help from Supt. 
C. H. Barnes, St. Cloud, Minn., who favors the “six-three-three 
plan” as he is working it. 
The following is from Supt. W. A. Greeson, Grand Rapids, 
Mich.: “I have not time to discuss the question submitted to 
me, ‘Is the six-year elementary school the best?’ I would sug- 
gest one thought: The ‘one-teacher-one-room’ plan of organiza- 
tion is the best, in my opinion for children below the age of 
puberty. There comes a time, however, when a greater variety 
of experience is desired and a greater variety of work should 
be offered than iis possible under the ‘one-teacher-one-room 
plan’ of organization. In my opinion this change of organization 
should come between the sixth and seventh grades rather than 
‘between the eighth and ninth grades.. 
“We find in Grand Rapids that the Junior high school 
holds the children beyond the sixth grade better than other 
schools. We also find that more children go from the eighth 
grade into the ninth grade in the Junior high school than in any 
other school in the city. The essential thing in my opinion is 
that between the sixth and seventh grades there should come a 
change from the ‘one-teacher-one-room’ plan to the depart- 
mental system. .. . In other words, I think it essential that the 
elementary form of education should close at the sixth grade.” 
Reports of the work in Grand Rapids may be had for the asking. 
I quote the following from Supt. L. N. Hines, Crawfords- 
ville, Ind.: “The six-and-six plan of dividing the twelve grades
-P-A-G-E-63
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 63 
is in successful operation in the Crawfordsville schools. The 
upper six grades, seventh to twelfth inclusive, are collected in 
one big plant located on an entire city block. . . . Practically all 
of our pupils enter the seventh grade gefore they are 14 years 
old. The compulsory education law in Indiana compels chil- 
dren to stay in school until they are fourteen. Since our chil- 
dren enter the seventh grade before they are beyond the com- 
pulsory law they get into the departmental system of teaching 
and change buildings for the last time before they are old 
enough to quit school. ... The pupil gets into the upper grades 
and gets accustomed to the ways of doing things there before 
he has any chance whatever to drop out. The line between the 
eighth grade and the first year high school is just as faint as 
it can be made. When the pupil once gets into the seventh 
grade there is no reason why he should drop out so far as the 
organization of the school is concerned. . . . With our eighth 
grade pupils there is nothing new or strange about the high 
school. They have been living with it for two years and know 
its teachers and its ways. The grammar grade pupils come and 
go with the high school pupils, and do part of their reciting in 
the same building, and attend lectures and entertainments and 
social functions with the high school pupils. ... In every way 
they are brought into the closest possible touch with the stu- 
dents in the upper four grades. 
«|. All grammar grade boys take manual training in the 
high school shop. All grammar grade girls take sewing in the 
high school building. . . . There is not the least thought in Craw- 
fordsville of doing away with the six-and-six plan, The Cen- 
tral school building is now being extended with the view of per- 
fecting the operation of the plan. The results are highly satis- 
factory. . .. The enrollment in the present senior class is 77 
while that of the 8th grade is 91. ... In 1911 the senior class 
numbered 59 while the 8th grade was 93. ... As the years go 
by we expect the number of pupils in the 8th grade and those 
in the 12th grade to draw nearer together until these two classes 
are the same size.” 
For the benefit of those who are to discuss the paper, I 
make the following summary of the advantages that may be 
hoped for as results of the proposed change: 
1. The six-year elementary course with the reorganiza- 
tion and change in method in the years above, will provide
-P-A-G-E-64
  64 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
more definite aims and more definite standards for both the 
elementary and the high school. At present both aims and 
standards are vague. 
2. It would lead to a reorganization of the curriculum, 
and force upon us the elimination of a mass of non-essentials 
from every branch of study, thus relieving the present conges- 
tion and confusion. 
8. It would enable us more easily to follow the teachings 
of educational psychology, suiting the subject-matter to the 
capabilities of the children, and the methods of teaching to both 
subject-matter and the child. 
4, It would favor the individual as against the “average” 
child—would break up the uniform course and the lock-step 
promotion by grade, and replace them by a diversified course 
and promotion by a subject. 
5. It would reduce the break between the elementary 
school and the high school to a minimum, and by placing the 
break earlier in the course, while the compulsory attendance 
law is still operative, would render the break far less danger- 
ous. The testimony of all bears out this conclusion. 
6. By making the road smoother, and more attractive, and 
thus keeping in school many who now fail and drop out, it would 
provide a cure for a considerable part of the retardation and 
elimination which every one agrees is at present a serious prob- 
lem. 
7. By providing the means of reorganizing the curriculum, 
and by introducing vocational subjects earlier in the course, the 
proposed changes would be equally advantageous for those who 
drop out and for those who stay in to the end. 
8. The proposed changes would lead to greatly increased 
efficiency both in teaching and in administration, eliminating 
waste of effort and of resources, thus making possible better edu- 
cation at the same cost. 
9. It would hasten the work of rural consolidation, since it 
would provide for a shorter elementary course. It would thus 
bring about a condition wherein a two-teacher school would be 
the equal in efficiency to a three-teacher school under our present 
eight-grade plan.

THE CHAIR: The subject will now be discussed from the 
point of view of the College by the Dean of Education of the Uni- 
versity of Georgia, Dr. T. J. Woofter. Prof. W. H. Hand is not 
present. : 
Dr. T. J. WooFTER: We have heard so much about the ele- 
mentary schools and colleges and the necessity of better high 
schools in the South, and I am reminded of that right now. I 
was depending on the discussion of Mr. Hand to lead up to the 
discussion of the point of view of the college. 
I can not say that I represent the point of view of the Col- 
lege. I can give you only some of my own thoughts. It was 
practically impossible for me to follow the paper, condense as it 
was, so as to digest it, and to be able to analyze it for you very 
fully, so the best I can do will be to give you some scattered 
thoughts on the ideas given by Dr. Fertig in his paper. 
The suggestions were full of meat. I agree with him in 
the comment on his first proposition. His first statement was 
that the main trouble seems to be with the early adolescent 
years in our school work. Now I believe that the elementary 
schools, up through the first six grades, in America, will com- 
pare very favorably indeed with those elsewhere in the world. 
We are not behind in these grades. Our juniors are interested. 
Our teaching is becoming more and more in line with what we 
would call the new education, and so from the standpoint of the 
work done by the teacher, and the interest taken by the child, 
we must say that our work here is well done. 
But at about the time indicated by the paper our children 
begin to lose interest in their work, and gradually they drop 
out and drop out. I don’t know that I am exactly in line with 
the remedy suggested. The conclusion summed up rapidly by 
Dr. Fertig was more in line with what I had in mind that the 
first part of his paper would indicate. If it is simply to bring 
the children earlier, as he said, in contact with the secondary 
ideals, leaving these secondary ideals such as they are mostly 
today, then I could not agree with him, for unless we take steps, 
in administering our schools in a different way, to bring the 
children in contact with ideals that are more nearly akin to 
their interests in that stage of development, we shall have 
made no gain in simply dividing our school system into six and 
six.

66 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
The trouble, as it seems to me, which was partly indicated 
by Dr. Fertig, is that in this course we begin to lose touch with 
the development of the child and the child’s interests. At this 
stage the child is more rapidly summing up the past, and is 
looking forward to the future with the greatest interest. At 
this time he must be reached through the activities of life more 
and more. And the trouble, it seems to me, is that our seventh 
and eighth grades have been more or less purposeless. The 
eighth grade especially has seemed to be empty and formal, and 
more or less of a dry review and rehash of what the child has 
gone over before and before until he has lost interest in that. 
It is not what he wants. He does not see that it fits his needs. 
He is looking forward, I say, to the activities of life, now tak- 
ing an interest in them; and in these reviews of geography and 
history and other subjects that he has gone over and over in 
the lower grades he is not interested, and he is losing touch 
with the school because the school is losing touch with his life. 
Now if such a reorganization must come, we should take ad- 
vantage of that reorganization to get something entirely differ- 
ent from the dry reviews that he has had in this eighth grade 
and from what he generally gets in the first two years of the 
high school. These two years in the high school are generally 
years that are preparatory to what he gets ahead. They look 
forward to the third and fourth years of the high school to put 
into practice what they are studying in the first and second 
years. They are more or less preparatory, in that sense, I mean. 
Now if the child gets no further touch with life activities than 
this, I say again we will not have touched at the root of the evil. 
The problem is one of administration, and as he says, this 
problem of school mortality is involved. Children begin to 
drop out rapidly from the ages of thirteen to sixteen, inclusive. 
That is the early period of adolescence. Now we must give 
the children at this time school work that will not only lead to 
the high school courses that are above him, but lead also to his 
work in life. Many of them drop out before they get into the 
high school, and many of them drop out very rapidly in the 
first two years of the high school, so we will say from twelve 
to sixteen is the critical period. Now we are in the stage of 
transition. This is well marked, inevitably, in our striving for 
democracy. We see it well marked in our political institutions. 
We can also see it in our religious institutions. It is especially
-P-A-G-E-67
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 67 
noticeable in our industrial orbit. The great advancement of 
science has eliminated from the home many of the industrial 
activities which gave to the child in part his education in the 
past, for with the factory system the industry has been trans- 
ferred and the home has been robbed of this line of activity. 
The school must come in here to the assistance of the social 
order,—more and more must the school do this. 
What I am after is this, that we can not merely accept the 
organization of the high school at present as the organization 
that will solve the great problem that has been put before us 
by Dr. Fertig. Our organizations must necessarily become 
more and more complex. The child at this time must be inter- 
ested, as I have indicated, in the vocational. Now the voca- 
tional is necessarily in the educational work of a democracy. 
It is necessary in order to give us a liberal education, and this 
phase must be taken care of in our new organization. We must 
provide for the interest of the child along many lines. There 
will be the agricultural lines. There will be the industrial lines. 
There will be the commercial lines. There will be the profes- 
sional lines, and it has been found that it is practically impos- 
sible to hold the children in school until they are entirely 
through what we would indicate as another six-year period of 
high school work. So we must, in our reorganization of our 
high school system, provide for something like the continuation 
schools of Germany and other countries of Europe, which are 
slowly finding their way into this country. 
Now in this reorganization we could, in the sixth, seventh 
and eighth grades, say, probably lead the child up to some kind 
of preparation for life, and if he is forced out into the work of 
life at this stage, we could handle his further development 
through the continuation schools, so that if, later on, he wished 
to enter college he would not find himself hampered, neither 
would he find that he is at a disadvantage in life because he is 
doomed the rest of his days to be more or less an unskilled 
laborer. So, from this standpoint, we would also aid our prob- 
lem of compulsory education. If we are to have the continua- 
tion schools and vocational education, we will be forced to the 
necessity of compulsory education as a logical conclusion. We 
must not only have vocational education, but we must have 
compulsory vocational education, so that no one will hamper 
society by being an unskilled laborer.

A reorganization of our school system in such a way that 
we can introduce the vocational, seems necessary, but in so do- 
ing we shall have to modify the ideals of the secondary schools 
as they are today. The vocational activities of the school must 
be looked after, as Dr. Fertig possibly indicated, by specialists, 
and if we can reorganize here, we can introduce the depart- 
mental teaching lower down. 
To my mind, the vocational activities for boys can not well 
be taken care of by women teachers in the schools. Neither can 
the vocational activities for the girls be taken care of by men 
teachers of the schools. But this will give us an opportunity 
to introduce into what is now some of the lower grade work 
more and more of men teachers. The problem of organization 
as set forth in the different states is one of great variation, as 
he has indicated. Now I haven’t come, in my mind, to endorse 
the notion of a six-year elementary school and a six-year high 
school. A 
But I wish to say, in closing, that in many of our Southern 
States we have in part solved this difficulty by working out our 
elementary schools on the basis of seven grades. We have 
eliminated the eighth grade in a great many of the states of the 
South. We now find the elementary school on the seven grade 
basis, and in that way we have saved one year. 
Our children do seem, when they get to the high school, to 
be behind the European children, but we have saved one year 
in the elementary school, and this is no longer an experiment, 
but a decided success, and is being commended to others of the 
nation by the educators of the North now. I do not know just 
when it began. I do not admit that it has been a haphazard in- 
troduction. It has been purposely and intentionally worked 
out. It was my fortune to take charge of the schools of a small 
point in the South, west of the Mississippi, and organize their 
graded system for the first time. They had had private schools 
entirely, run on the subscription plan, some for boys and some 
for girls, but they did not adequately answer the purpose, so 
they put up a new building, got ready and got the school to- 
gether, and it was my problem to organize the graded system 
for that town for the first time. That was in 1889, and I 
worked out my scheme for the elementary school on the seven 
grade basis. Now the beginning was evidently earlier than
-P-A-G-E-69
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 69 
that, and little by little it has gone into a great many of the 
Southern States. I regret to see that Mississippi is trying right 
now to organize on the old customary basis of eight grades 
again in some points in Mississippi, but it is not so in Georgia, 
my own state, it is not so in Virginia, and it is not so in many 
other Southern States, and I am merely calling your attention 
to this as I think it a contribution of the Southern States to the 
administration of the school system of this country. 
Now this transition that I have spoken of is one that is 
going on in education, and is going to call for a reorganization of 
our system. We do not want to take over the seventh and 
eighth grades and continue these just as high school grades. 
That will not solve the problem at all. Our organization must 
be one of greater and greater complexity. Necessarily so. We 
must face the problem of vocational education, and in this the 
college is involved, and our college curriculum must reorganize 
also. 
I know I have taken more than my time, and I am going to 
stop here, hoping that some one else will take up the discus- 
sion. It brings to our attention one of the perplexing problems 
that we have today. It is a problem of administration, largely, 
though the problem of teaching, also the methods adapted to 
the grade, are involved. We pedagogues are too prone to fol- 
low the old and customary way, and we have followed that or- 
der until the changed conditions of society begin to cry aloud 
for reorganization. My appeal to you now is to take hold of 
these problems from the standpoint of the school man, and let 
us try to lead the South in these matters educational, and as 
we have already led the country in the direction of the elimina- 
tion of one year, let us probably lead the country in the re- 
organization of our entire school system through the element- 
ary school, the high school and the college. (Applause). 
THE CHAIR: State Superintendent Barksdale Hamlett, of 
Kentucky, will continue the discussion. 
HON. BARKSDALE HAMLETT: Mr. Chairman: I have just 
gotten in, and do not know just what to say, having failed to 
hear the leading address, and heard only the closing remarks 
of the gentleman who has just preceded me. I came here ex- 
pecting to prepare myself by listening to the discussions pre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
70 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
ceding me, and have just got off the train, with hardly time to 
get breakfast, so I am at considerable disadvantage to know 
just what to say on this question. 
In Kentucky we have the complete eight grade system. 
We attempt to follow it in the country schools as well as in the 
city schools, and we are getting along very nicely with it. In 
Kentucky we are trying to accomplish things, rather than waste 
too much time arguing about methods, red tape and formali- 
ties. In other words, the great problem with us is to get the 
children in school. If we get them through three grades, all of 
them, we are better satisfied than if we got a few of them 
through twelve grades. Now of course a child under that sys- 
tem, if he goes through the university, if he takes one year to 
each grade, is about twenty-six years old when he finishes his 
education. 
I have read some criticism sent me by Mr. Fertig. That 
is all I have seen about this discussion. I was coming here to 
advocate very strongly the continuation of the eight grade sys- 
tem until I got the gentleman’s letter—day before yesterday, I 
believe,—in which he offers some splendid suggestions and 
criticisms, and in most of them I agree with him heartily. I 
think the matter must be settled, largely, however, by dealing 
with the individual pupil. There are children who require the 
full eight years. There are others who can complete the course 
we give in eight years in six years, and-I do not believe we 
should undertake or attempt to make any iron clad rules as to 
the promotion of pupils. There are precocious children, who 
can economize time, and even graduate from universities, tak- 
ing a Ph. degree, by the time they are twenty-one or twenty- 
two. There are others who would not do it until they were 
forty or fifty. I would like to stay at school until I was forty. 
I like to go to school. 
Now to review the matter sent to me in advocacy of the 
six-year plan, which, as I understand from his correspondence, 
he is for and advocates strongly: 
First. Lack of specific task for elementary school or high 
school. Now I think that that suggestion is a good one, if we 
had time to discuss it in full. It hinges in my mind largely on 
the extent to which we adopt and carry on the vocational idea 
in our educational system. I think the future of the South
-P-A-G-E-71
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 1 
educationally now depends upon the perfection, as far as pos- 
sible, of the public school system. In fact, outside of the con- 
tinuation of certain necessary evils in the way of high schools, 
private institutions, I think we have no need for anything ex- 
cept the public schools from the bottom to the top. That is 
democracy, and that is the spirit of the American people. I 
think the time has come when we must get away from the 
cross-roads college. That has been the most serious source of 
corruption of real, capable work, where men are employed for 
gain only, and ideals are lowered. Pardon me for that criti- 
cism. 
Second. The break between the elementary and high 
school is too long delayed, and comes at the wrong time in the 
mental development of the pupil. I agree with the gentleman 
there. However, I have already prefaced my remarks by stat- 
ing that we are following the eight grade system in Kentucky. 
I heard the closing remarks of the preceding speaker, and he 
seems to be inclined to the seven grade system. I believe he 
is right in that. 
The present plan complicates the problem of discipline. 
That is true. It does. 
It makes necessarily poor teaching in the upper grade. 
I do not agree with the gentleman there. I do not see any 
reason why the teaching should be any poorer in the present 
grades than under the system which he proposes. The fact of 
the business is, under our present system, if we can just bring 
about sufficient public sentiment under our present plan we 
would have good teaching from the first grade through the 
high school. I wish that the other Southern States would get 
busy, as we have been trying to do in Kentucky, and pay sal- 
aries sufficient to employ competent teachers in all the grades. 
There is no reason why the child in the first, second and third 
grade should have any more inferior teaching than the child 
in the high school, or even in college, but you would have to put 
up money with which to do it. That means a campaign of edu- 
cation. It is wasteful of teaching forces and material equip- 
ment. By the adoption of the departmental system of instruc- 
tion in the four grades above the elementary and primary de- 
partment of the public school system, I think that that criti- 
cism could be eliminated.
-P-A-G-E-72
  72 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
Now the other suggestions stated in the second part of his 
communication interest me more than the first,—a statement of 
the advantages to be gained by the change. First, that we 
would give a definite aim to the elementary schools and force 
the elimination of non-essentials from the curriculum. I agree 
with the leading speaker heartily in that. I believe that we 
have incorporated in our curriculum enough work to keep the 
average child busy for forty years, instead of eight, if it were 
all done thoroughly. I believe that we should give attention to 
the preparing of the pupil for the business of life, and the up- 
building of character, that a great deal of education is a matter 
of living and developing as long as we live,—I agree with the 
gentleman there. 
Second. It is in harmony with educational psychology. I 
agree with him in that without further discussion. 
Third. It breaks up the lock-step promotion. There is no 
necessity for any lock-step promotion, even with the eight grade 
systtem. I have been teaching in the graded schools for many 
years, and have never had any lock-step system of promotion. 
When a child was ready to go into another grade, if it was the 
first of January or December or May, I put him where he be- 
longed, regardless of any red tape system of promotion. So I 
take issue with the gentleman there. It depends upon the man 
who is at the head of the system or the teacher who is conduct- 
ing the country school, if it be in a rural district school. In 
other words, they should exercise common sense and good judg- 
ment for the benefit of the child. We are running the child too 
much, these days, for the benefit of the teachers. Let us get 
back to running the child for the benefit of the child, and the 
material prosperity of the people in the community we serve. 
I believe in the work of the consolidation of the rural schools. 
I cannot concur with the gentleman entirely there. Of course 
I have not heard his argument. He may have given you reasons 
to sustain that. I think that the one and sole medium through 
which consolidation may be effected is the building of good 
roads. This we are trying to do in Kentucky. You can never 
have a system of consolidated schools unless you have a system 
of good roads. 
Seventh. It will facilitate the introduction of hand work 
into the schools, and better fit those who drop out of school be-
-P-A-G-E-73
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 73 
fore the course is completed. I cannot agree with him fully 
there, since the introduction of such work would tend to in- 
crease the number of years, rather than to decrease. We are 
already introducing these features in our public schools in my 
state, and I find that it takes some time. 
That covers the ground, as far as this little exegesis sent 
me is concerned. As a matter of compromise, I merely want 
to tell you finally what I think about it. I am willing to accept 
seven years. I think that is a plenty, and then if the child can 
not make it in seven years, provide for his extended study an- 
other year in some way. It can be done under the manage- 
ment and proper guidance of any good school man who has 
common sense and judgment. 
I beg your pardon for this rather scattered discussion, but 
at any rate I am glad to greet you as a Kentuckian, glad to be 
here, and to see so many Southern people here. I thank you. 
THE CHAIR: With the permission of the Association, in 
justice to all of the speakers, the Chairman will try to finish the 
entire program before throwing any question open for discus- 
sion, unless you, of course, as you have the right, prescribe a 
different course. Also let me ask the speakers to please, in 
justice to all who follow, come within the limits of twenty min- 
utes for papers and ten for discussion, so that we all may have 
a fair chance. 
The next speaker, Supt. L. B. Evans, of Augusta, Ga., will 
address you upon the subject of the Utilization of the School 
Plant in Community Extension Work. 
Hon. L. B. EvANS: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentle- 
men—lI apologize for lack of manuscript and preparation. I 
apologize for a bad voice. I do not apologize for my subject. 
It is already so well known to you that it needs no apology and 
but little elucidation,—The Wider Use of the School Plant. 
We have got, in the United States of America, something 
over three billions of dollars invested in school houses. Ordi- 
narily speaking, these school houses are opened five hours a 
day, five days of the week. That is 25 hours a week, 100 hours 
a month, 900 hours a year, the limit, excusing all the holidays. 
Now it seems to me that 900 hours a year, out of a possible use 
of the school house of three thousand hours, or thirty-six hun-
-P-A-G-E-74
  74 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
dred hours, is to lock up into our school plants a great deal of 
money that could be utilized more than it is now utilized. The 
public fund built these school houses. The tax-payer paid for 
them, and to say that they should be confined exclusively to the 
ordinary day schools of that term, from 9 o’clock in the morn- 
ing until 2 or 3 o’clock in the afternoon, is to deny to the public 
and to refuse to the school houses themselves their greatest use 
and their utmost efficiency. I find, as a general thing, that the 
school teachers are not much in favor of using the school houses 
after school hours. It is the old ery of, “I have just as much 
to do as I can stagger under, and I am not trying to add more 
time and more labor to my already burdened shoulders.” But 
there is arising in our country now-a-days a demand that some- 
thing shall be done with our school houses beyond the ordinary 
school hours. Notably in the State of New York, where the 
extension work is reaching out until all classes of the popula- 
tion, regardless of age and regardless of sex are touched. In 
the city of Rochester, in the city of Boston, in the city of Phila- 
delphia, in a number of our Southern cities, the schools are 
open to all comers at other hours than those of the ordinary 
school time. You take the Stuyvesant High School in the city 
of New York, a school that cost a million and a half dollars. 
From early morning until about three o’clock in the afternoon 
that school is confined to the ordinary school work of children 
about fourteen to sixteen years of age. It is closed about three 
o’clock, and the janitors clean it up. But about six o’clock the 
passer-by will notice that the lights in that school begin to shine, 
and he will see an industrious looking person walk in, followed 
by others, followed by still more, going in there for purpose 
of learning in that school something more about the business in 
which they are then engaged, and the wheels begin to turn, the 
drawing boards are brought out, and the cooking school is 
opened again, and from six o’clock to ten o’clock the school is in 
operation again, with half as many pupils enrolled as there are 
in the day school. Is it the same corps of teachers? No, it is 
a different corps of teachers. They maintain there very wisely 
that a teacher can not teach from 9 o’clock in the morning till 
8 o’clock in the afternoon, and then begin at 6 o’clock and teach 
till ten o’clock at night, but it does not hurt the school building 
to be used by two sets of teachers under one principal. Now 
he is a very wise principal in his day and generation, so he sits
-P-A-G-E-75
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 75 
in his office and sees the wheels go round. Why should a prin- 
cipal or superintendent work himself to death when he can 
make others work? And so the principal of the school can 
afford to sit there and see things go round, and do the thinking, 
and do the head work and direct the energies of two sets of 
teachers, and make a great high school that, instead of being 
used five hours, is used ten hours. It is also used on Saturdays, 
and also on Sundays. (Applause). In other words, the propo- 
sition of extension work of evening schools is an easy proposi- 
tion. It is obviously the first step toward a wider extension of 
our school plant. Now there are very few school systems in 
this country, there are very few cities in the South that haven’t 
some form of evening schools. They have had them in the 
school systems of which I have been in charge for a number of 
years. I have seen gray-haired men, with beards, with eyes so 
dim that they could hardly see to read, come in there from the 
mountains, and from the depths of the woods, who are unable 
to read, and sit down in the school by the side of a fourteen or 
fifteen years old boy, probably his grandchild, and both learn 
to read out of the same primer. It is open to all comers for 
that kind of work. The evening school is naturally, as I say, 
is the obvious way for the extension work in our schools. Don’t 
think that it is necessary to have the teachers of the day school 
teach every night. That is too much nervous strain. But a 
night school can be opened six nights in the week. The same 
room can be used six nights in the week. It can be used three 
nights by one set of teachers, and three nights by another set 
of teachers. The same pupils should not be requested to come 
six nights in the week. As a matter of fact, the evening schools 
are largely for those who have to work, and who have to work 
with their hands, who have been denied in their early years the 
advantage of education, and who stand before a wheel in a mill 
or in a shop, and have the edge of the ax cut into their hearts 
hour by hour, and it is greatly to their credit that when they 
lay down their work at six o’clock, after nine hours of it, they 
are willing to go once, twice or thrice a week into a school 
where they can learn to do a better job than they are doing. It 
is vastly to their credit. As a matter of fact they can not, and 
ought not to be asked to go every night of the week, and the 
discouraging feature of it is that we expect them to go more 
frequently than their nervous strain will allow. 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  76 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
Now take up another phase of it, that is, the moral side of 
it. I have been out about the city, and it has fairly sickened 
me to see the lack of provision for men and boys enjoying them- 
selves in wholesome, harmless ways, and to see the sort of 
places that they are spending their leisure time in. When I go 
out for experience I generally get a plenty—it comes to me, 
and if you will walk about your city with your eyes open to 
see things I believe you will be very much surprised at some 
of the things you will find. 
I was asked in one of my schools the other day if I would 
not allow the use of our school house for Sunday school pur- 
poses—the use of the school house of the city for Sunday school 
purposes. I said, “Why, certainly, certainly. Why should we 
not have in our assembly hall on Sunday afternoon, with our 
piano and our equipment, a Sunday school? Why should we 
not open it, and go out into the highways and by-ways, in an 
undenominational, non-sectarian way, and as educators and 
uplifters of the community go out and have a Sunday school 
in our plant?” (Applause). So we opened up one of our 
school houses as a Sunday School, and it is still in use. The 
Baptists and Methodists and Episcopalians all got to fussing 
about whose Sunday school it should be, of course. I said, “It 
is everybody’s Sunday school,” and we stuck to that, and we are 
going to have an undenominational, non-sectarian Sunday school 
in our day school assembly hall as long as they behave them- 
selves.. 
Now some of my friends asked me, “Mr. Superintendent, if 
you are going to have a Sunday school on Sunday afternoon, let’s 
have a prayer meeting on Wednesday night.” So I said, “It 
seems to me that is extension work. So we will have a prayer 
meeting on Wednesday night,’ I said, “Go to it. Have your 
prayer meeting here.” So we had prayer meeting in our school 
house. 
After a while a good old Baptist brother came around and 
said, “Mr. Superintendent, our church wants to hold revival ser- 
vices every night in the week for about two weeks in one of your 
school houses.” I said, “I think that is imposing on the commun- 
ity to have revival services.” So I did draw the line at the re- 
vival meetings, but I said, “So far as these school houses of Rich- 
mond County are concerned, in the city or in the country, they
-P-A-G-E-77
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 1 
are open for Sunday schools and they are open for prayer 
meetings once a week so long as you do not teach doctrine.” 
And I think, ladies and gentlemen, that is right. 
Now there is the moral side of it. There is another side 
of it, and that is the social side of it. Do you know that we 
abuse the social idea without understanding it? It is in the 
social excesses that we make our greatest error. We are sociable 
animals. It is just as natural for a man to dance and to sing as 
it is for him to laugh and to play. We are made to laugh. We 
are built that way. We are made to enjoy things in this life. 
Man is a sociable animal. 
I had a communication and a request from one of my subur- 
ban schools, a small school in a hard-working, semi-farming com- 
munity, to allow the assembly hall, or small room that we called 
the assembly hall, to be used for social entertainments of the 
people of that community. I says, “Why, certainly. What do 
you mean by social entertainment?” They said, “Why, dancing, 
of course.” Well, I thought it over. I said I thought as we used 
it for Sunday school Sunday afternoon, why not use it for danc- 
ing Monday night. The two seemed to go pretty well together, 
one being a Sunday affair and the other a Monday affair. But 
that was provided they did it right. So I opened up the school 
room, and they danced there Monday night, and of course it 
created a good deal of disturbance, a good deal of criticism on 
the part of the community, and I had to investigate. So I went 
out to the next dance. It was in the middle of July, and the fiddle 
—you know how the fiddle goes—and they were having the time 
of their lives, and young man as I was, I harked back to the days 
of my college life, and I felt very much like shaking a foot my- 
self. Harmless amusement. They had no place to go—no place 
to meet, and I said, “So long as you stay in this school house, 
and when you get tired sit on the piazzas only, and have chap- 
erons here to look after you, use my school house for your social 
pleasures, even if you do call it a dance.” Now we have, at a 
great many places, a regular well defined plan of public enter- 
tainment and instruction. 
The moving picture machine is to be adopted or adapted by 
the educators and educational institutions of this country, and is 
going to be a great means of educational uplift, as well as social 
entertainment and pleasure. (Applause). We need to get the 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
78 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
insurance companies to take away the insurance restrictions 
against the use of these inflammable films in our school houses, 
and the threatening us with the vitiating of our insurance poli- 
cies if we introduce the moving picture machine. This is being 
looked after, and that will be done, and one of the equipments of 
every school is going to be a moving picture apparatus. (Ap- 
plause). We will be put upon the circuit, and every afternoon 
and every night, and every Saturday and every Saturday night, 
and every Sunday, there will be the appropriate educational, 
moral, Christian exhibitions that we all love to see. Everybody 
loves to see a moving picture show. And when the kineto-photo- 
graphic attachment brings to us not only the visible appearance 
of the master speaker, but the phonograph synchronizes his very 
voice, so that we can see him and hear him, we shall have brought 
the great masters in the presence of those people who otherwise 
would never see them, and never hear them. 
Think of the vagrant population that walks our streets, and 
think of what we can do for them—not in your higher circles 
where they go to their theatres, where they have their clubs and 
their churches, but in the slums, in the suburbs of the mill dis- 
tricts where, when the mill closes, the saloon and the gambling 
house and brothel open, and lure to destruction. We have our 
boys and our girls in our schools up to about two o’clock—then 
they have nothing else to do. No place to go. No clubs—they 
can’t afford that. Churches closed. No social halls that are 
properly supervised. So they drift to the dance hall, to the'sa- 
loon, while our disgraced school houses stand silent and dark and 
closed. It is ashame. We have got to open these doors, turn on 
these light, and put something in these school houses with enough 
life and enough gaiety to make them want to come. They are not 
coming there to be sermonized. They are not coming there to 
hear any lecture upon any abtruse philosophy subject. They 
haven’t got that far. They want to be first lured by entertain- 
ment, and then helped by instruction, and that object must be 
approached gradually. 
Now what and where? Never mind your refined centers. 
They are being looked after. It is in the suburbs, in the mill dis- 
tricts, in the factory districts, where our school houses are, that 
we must pay attention, and it is the opportunity that comes to us 
for the wider use of the school house, both in its educational, its
-P-A-G-E-79
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 19 
moral and in its social features that we are now neglecting, and 
we can ill afford to do so. 
I believe if we would just once not allow ourselves to pay 
attention only to our own comfort and to our own social pleas- 
ures, but will, in company with someone who knows, visit these 
conditions and see the kind of recreation in which they indulge, 
we will find that there is an opportunity lying right before us 
that we are neglecting, and that under the inspiration of a splen- 
did opportunity we will take advantage of these school houses of 
ours, to open them in the moral, social and educational behalf of 
our community. I thank you very much. 
THE CHAIR: I think Superintendent Evans has earned our 
gratitude by showing us what a magnificent use can be made of 
twenty minutes. 
I want to ask if Superintendent C. J. Bowen, of Chatta- 
nooga, is here. It seems that he is not here, so we will have the 
discussion opened by Hon. Jno. R. Kirk, President State Normal, 
Kirksville, Mo. 
HON. JOHN R. KIRK: The school should be the means of 
drawing together all classes of citizens of a community. The best 
commencement exercises I think that I ever saw in any kind of 
public educational institution, built and operated by the taxes of 
the people of a city was of this character. The whole cosmopoli- 
tan community came out to hear the baccalaureate sermon. It 
was preached by a Jewish Rabbi. Sitting next to him were two 
Catholic priests. Beyond the priests was an Episcopalian, and 
strung down on the right hand side of the Rabbi were the preach- 
ers of the M. E. Church and the Southern Methodist Church, the 
Baptist Church, and two or three Presbyterian Churches, seven 
or eight or nine—I don’t remember the exact number; and the 
Rabbi, being asked, when they got him into town, what would be 
his pleasure as to the combination whereby reading and prayer 
and benediction and all that might be done, he said: “Oh, I am 
just a kind of a heathen. I just want to mix up with all of you, 
and you go off and get a whole lot of these preachers together, 
and tell them to read a whole lot and pray a good deal, and sing 
some and have a benediction, and I will just preach.” And he 
just preached real religion, and when he was done the Catholic 
priest shook hands with him, and I saw some dear old Methodist 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  80 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
ladies go right up there,—I think there were several dear old 
Methodist ladies of my church that came up there and shook 
hands with a Catholic priest for the first time in their life. That 
is one of the uses that the public school may be put to, to get 
all of the people that have any kind of interest in it together in 
religious and social and_political, undenominational and elemosi- 
nary ways. I just wanted to extend the right hand of fellowship 
to Brother Evans and take him into my church. He is going 
some, I tell you. (Laughter). I can not agree with him in one 
particular. I would have said to that protracted meeting, “Go it, 
boots.” 
Three weeks ago on a similar public property it was my 
delight to see, for about three days, strings of farmers. It was 
a public school property, with seven or eight acres of ground, in 
one part trees, another an athletic field, another a little lake that 
they called a pond. At the beginning of the program several 
tents were put up—tents for the fine hogs, tents for the fine 
sheep. There were one hundred Percheron horses, horses all the 
way from Kentucky, some of them, and this was over in the north 
of Missouri,—all kinds of stock. And the County Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation was being held at the same time, and it was what they 
called a rural educational conference combined with a stock and 
grain show, and there were actually inside two beautiful days, 
more than three thousand farmers and farmers’ wives and boys 
and girls, and nearly one thousand school teachers of the com- 
munity and of a school teacher factory that was right close by— 
the kind they call in some states normal school—and they were 
all mixed up together on the place, and a great lot of the farmers 
came in to hear the school teachers’ ideas, similar to those of 
Superintendent Evans, and the preachers were there, and there 
was one that they called the “Sky Pilot of the Ozarks,’’ because 
the modest fellow had gone into one of the most dreary regions 
of the Ozarks in Southwest Missouri, close to Arkansas and Indi- 
ana—that is going a good ways, some people think, and the splen- 
did fellow had found the young people going home three morn- 
ings in the week with red eyes, on account of dancing—not as 
Mr. Evans would have them do—but dancing nearly all night. 
So he said to them. “Come next Wednesday night to hear me. 
I am a preacher.” They came, and he asked them whether 
they could sing pretty well, and they said they could not, so he 
sent off for a singing master, and they organized classes, which
-P-A-G-E-81
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS a1 
broke in on the all-night dances, and then he started literary 
societies. All his first meetings were under a walnut tree, 
which is now surrounded by a beautiful fence, and considered 
a monument by all that part of Missouri. Meanwhile a small 
church had been built, and after that a larger church. And as 
the cross-roads grew up to be a village, the moving picture 
show came. The first night the moving pictures were on exhi- 
bition the preacher was there on the front seat. It was a regu- 
lar blood and thunder, shooting cowboy capers, with bowie 
knives and revolvers and death. A day or two later he preached, 
and said not a word about dances or moving pictures, but ten 
days later a great big box was taken off the train nearby, and it 
came by express. It had a motion picture machine in it, and 
forthwith he got together the same aggregation, consisting of 
singing classes and the literary society and the baseball combina- 
tion of old men and young men, and the Woman’s Club that had 
got itself organized, and a lot of others joined, and passed their 
judgment as to the character of the motion pictures that should 
come, and it does not cost anyone in that neighborhood anything 
now to see all of the motion pictures. The 5c motion picture 
shows came there, but the people did not care for them, so they 
stopped. The people put up their own money for their own plant, 
and had the right sort of shows. 
Then the preacher—just a preacher—pretty soon, at Ho- 
burg, off there in the wilds of the Ozarks, got himself elected sec- 
retary of the school board, and then a member of the school 
board. He said that was what he had been wanting to do for a 
long time, and so they overhauled the school, and they trans- 
formed the box-car school house into one that was fit for use, and 
then they made many uses of it, as Mr. Evans has advocated. 
And then a Township ten miles square came to be so knit 
around the slender 120-pound preacher that they voted $75,000 
taxes to build roads, and now they have Macadamized roads 
through and through that township, where a preacher that was 
some account got started. (Applause). But in some other parts 
of Missouri, where I lived, where they have one country church 
for every nine square miles, the country church is a dilapidated, 
unpainted thing, with some of the weatherboarding hanging by 
a nail at one end, and the preacher rides out there from the city 
once a month, and preaches his little sermon, and then says good- 
bye, and you can almost hear his coat-tails crack as he turns the 
6
-P-A-G-E-82
    82 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
corner getting back to town, and that preacher—we have a lot 
of them in my neighborhood—is not doing any good for his 
church, the community, education, good roads, or anything else 
—he is almost a dead letter in the community. They keep up 
malignity and narrow-mindedness and debates on baptism, and 
things like that. 
I know of one splendid woman with ideals, who went to the 
most dilapidated school house that was known in the county. She 
has money of her own, and her relatives are rich, and she knew 
that she had skill and power. She persuaded the men and the 
women to come, the women to bring the dinners, and have a 
sort of party, a pleasant day, and they lifted the old school 
house up and put a concrete basement under it, and they put a 
ventilating apparatus and an equalizer of the temperature in 
the basement, and dining tables and tables for games in that 
cheap converted basement; they plugged the mouth of the pump 
outside, and tapped the pump stock a little lower down, and any- 
one that steps into that basement can see the inexpensive, the 
really not more than $10.00 kitchen pressure tank, protruding 
from the wall, and there is a bubbling cup, and there is a wash- 
basin, and they have tested that water. And the organ is there 
in that rural school,—Lyon & Healy will sell you as sweet toned 
an organ as you ever heard for the school or a little church, 
that you can carry, it weighs not over 50 pounds. In that 
school they have the organ and a library, and all the children 
can sing, and they have a literary society, and the men and 
women, even to two or three hard pressed distressed-looking 
dear old Catholic women, that were never in a Protestant 
church, but they all go, and mix up in there, and it is a glorious 
combine, and they are making what Superintendent Evans would 
consider good use of that school house. There around that 
school house the people are so religious that they think they 
would go some place if they ever danced, but the teacher has 
taught the children folk dances, German folk dances and Dan- 
ish movements and Swedish movements, and in several of the 
school houses they haven’t seats screwed to the floor, as you see 
in so many of the schools. And here is one that will never 
superintend the schools where in the new buildings the seats 
are fastened to the floor. They are to be used and pushed out 
of the way when you want a big party of all the folks. Folding 
chairs, so that you can double and treble the number of folks

in there for any of these programs they give for the benefit of 
the whole community are better. There in that peculiar school 
I have just mentioned, where the missionary woman works for 
$50.00 a month, though she has money loaned that brings her 
more than that, she delights in her profession, and she is a 
power, and the people gather for every sort of community in- 
terest that you could think of. Next week two of the university 
professors go to that rural school, and for five days give a series 
of lessons on stock raising and cereal and soil management, and 
things that are worth while. This is a community where they 
are trying to banish the one-year course in biology, that never 
functions. We are trying to get rid of the isolated and detached 
college courses in physics and in chemistry, and tumble a great 
lot of these things together, and get the juice out of a few of 
them. We are trying to get rid of a lot of the dead matter 
which tradition has lodged in the one-year curriculum, so that 
the time of live human beings can be devoted to those things 
instead today that will function in service tomorrow. But I 
have used my ten minutes of time. I thank you. 
THE CHAIR: We will now hear from Miss Virginia P. 
Moore, State Improvement Organizer, of Nashville. 
MISS VIRGINIA P. MoorE: So many things have been said 
that nothing else is necessary. But before I have finished I 
know many of you will think I am very much like the doctor 
that went down in the swamp section to practice medicine— 
perhaps you have heard of him. He didn’t know how to treat 
anything but fits. And after he went into this region a woman 
came to the doctor and said, “Oh, Doctor, do come over and see 
my son. He is almost dead.” The doctor went over, and found 
the son sick with malarial fever. He discovered that he had 
the fever all right, but, looking very much distressed, he said 
to the woman, “Madam, I am a fit doctor. I don’t know how to 
treat fever. I am a fit doctor.” The woman thereupon looked 
very distressed, and said, “Oh, Doctor, please do throw my son 
into a fit, and then treat him.” 
Now I feel that I can not let this subject pass without 
something being said about how we are to get into these schools, 
because there are a great many school officials who dare not let 
you come into the school buildings. Mr. Evans and Dr. Kirk 
have given us splendid talks showing the wonderful community 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  84 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
service that can be gotten out of the school buildings, but I 
have been in a great many of the pig paths in Tennessee, and 
instead of being eager to work with us for the benefit of the 
community, some of them, because they are afraid the property 
will be damaged, and they won’t be elected next time, won’t 
let you touch the school house. But when you first get the peo- 
ple in the community aroused, and then go after that superin- 
tendent, he dare not keep‘ it closed, so I find that about the best 
way to get these school houses opened is to get the community 
aroused and interested. I find places where there is little 
social contact, where they have no place of meeting, many 
places where they haven’t even a church, but if we once start a 
school improvement association, and get the people awake to 
the fact that the school is their property, and that they must 
keep it beautiful and improved, and then let this work of beauti- 
fying the schools be an example of what they can do in their 
homes, then we will begin in just a small way by giving them 
a social center in that community, and it won’t be long until 
cooking lessons, sewing lessons, and all sorts of advice for the 
home can be studied. Then the School Improvement and To- 
mato Club, or Canning Club, as it is known in many states, 
where the old folks come out, and all feel that they must help 
Jennie and Sarah and Mary, and in thus working together in 
many places the ladies have given all the surplus in the garden 
for canning, and in many places they sell all of this, using the 
proceeds for the improvement of the school. Then Jennie and 
Mary and Sarah are so happy that they have taught the old 
folks something that they never knew before. 
I think sometimes the teachers are unequal to the task of 
uplifting the community, and that they do not always know how 
to go about it. Mrs. Kirkland was the promoter of the Colonial 
Dames helping to buy a little cottage and a few acres of ground 
at Millerstown, and then they sent a missionary down there. 
but she wrote the Colonial Dames that the house was being 
rocked, and she was afraid to stay there. So Mrs. Kirkland 
asked me if I would go there with Mrs. Brown, who had agreed 
to go during the summer, and help plan some work and try to 
get the codperation of the people. So last April we went to 
Millerstown. I found a very pleasant welcome at the school, in 
fact the superintendent told me they had cleaned the school 
house up many times because they thought I was coming, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 85 
they wanted to look as well as possible, but some way I had 
never been able to reach there. Well, they had put forth a great 
effort in our honor, and had a picnic dinner. They had cow 
~peas in tin buckets, they had the most indigestible bread I ever 
saw, and chicken—I know they had one chicken on the table, 
and that wasn’t fit to eat. The whole thing was really dis- 
tressing. 
It was too late to organize a Tomato Club, but I told Mrs. 
Brown we would appoint her as a voluntary collaborator, and 
we would do what we could to help that community, and in that 
little school house about 18 x 24, just like a side-tracked box 
ear, only I believe a little worse,—I thought it was the most 
impossible situation I had ever seen, it seemed to me there was 
nothing, no point of contact with the people, who were mostly 
from the poorest mountain homes. We were to have speaking 
that afternoon, and after seeing those terrible thick biscuit, I 
told those people more deviltry and more devilment had come 
from the stomach than the heart, and that we would start on 
bread-making, and give some recipes, and even the men took 
them down, were delighted to have them. I just told them 
frankly about indigestible food, and about how they could save 
the surplus from their summer gardens, and have a better food 
supply for the winter. Well, one old lady came up to me and 
says, “I heard you tell about that canning business. I would 
like to know how you do it.” I said, “How do you do it?” She 
went on to tell me. I said, “How much do you put up during a 
season?” She replied, “Well, I reckon I put up nigh on to three 
or four dozen jars.” I asked her how it kept. She said, “Well, 
a lot of it do mould on top, and ain’t much good.” I said, “Well, 
it is pretty hot hard work.” .To this she assented. I said, 
“You know the way the government is teaching the girls to do 
it,—Mrs. Brown is going to teach it to you, and I want you to go 
and see Mrs. Brown.” And Mrs. Brown did a wonderful work 
there, and the Colonial Dames deserve the credit for starting a 
work that could be kept up all over the country. She didn’t go 
ostensibly as a missionary. She simply went out and spent the 
summer, and in her own tactful way, and in the truest mission- 
ary spirit, and in the real spirit of the uplifter—you know, I 
hate uplifters, I do, those folks that sit up on a pedestal and 
draw their skirts right close around them when they come down 
to try to help folks—but Mrs. Brown jwent there to live among 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  86 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
these people with a big desire in her heart to help them. She 
took with her one of those little organs that Dr. Kirk spoke of, 
and a lot of the folks had never heard the music before, and 
they came eager to hear her play. And she had a stereopticon, 
that was a great thing, and Mrs. Brown says she would put 
in the President’s picture, and say, “Now tell me who this is,” 
and they wouldn’t know. And if she showed them great scenes 
and beautiful things they would say nothing, but if she showed 
them something ridiculous, such as a dressed up rooster, they 
would have the most fun in the world. So you can see the diffi- 
culty in finding a point of contact. 
She had an ice cream supper, though she had to send 
eighteen or twenty miles for the ice, and one of the folks said, 
when given some of the ice cream, “I don’t believe I want all of 
that cold butter.” 
Before the end of the season came, they had ceased firing 
off the pistol, and the house was rocked no more. All were wel- 
come at her home, to come into her kitchen and help, and eat 
at her table, and see just how she lived. They knew nothing 
about sanitation, and she taught them great lessons along that 
line. She showed them, too, how to utilize the garden products 
that were going to wast, and at the end of the season they had 
about 1,400 cans of fruit that they had just picked up, you 
might say. The people were wonderstruck when I told the 
girls about putting up sometimes as high as 300 cans a day, and 
some of them thought I was the biggest kind of a prevaricator. 
But at the end of the season one old man came up to Mrs. 
Brown and put his hands in his pockets, and said, “If you had 
been out here last year I would have been worth a thousand 
dollars where I am not worth a penny now, because last year 
we had so much to go to waste, where we didn’t have anything 
much this year on account of the dry season.” 
Now we are going to try to experiment along this line,— 
the collaborators are going to try to have social evenings, with 
moving picture shows, and we hope Mr. Knapp is going to dis- 
tribute some of these around the state, so that we can send them 
around to different places, and give these people around the 
country a little life, and at the time they will be of great service 
in giving the people needful instruction. We want to teach the 
people how they can utilize from the garden and the orchard 
what is now going to waste, and that at a very small cost, fifty
-P-A-G-E-87
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 87 
cents or a dollar, they may beautify a room, that with seventy- 
five cents worth of blue denim or brown denim or Japanese 
towels they can carry out a beautiful color scheme. I have 
already in the hands of the printer a letter of suggestions for 
each of the winter months for the girls in the Canning Club, 
things that they can do at home, and just how they can help 
that home, and in order to be sure that the work was being 
made practical,—I always like to test things out, though my 
mother thinks I am very foolish. On last Tuesday I decided I 
would take one room in the house, and see how cheaply I could 
beautify and improve it. You should have seen me last Tues- 
day, trying to see just at what cost I could make that room as 
pretty as any parlor. And you would really be surprised to see 
at what a small cost, by the exercise of some taste and ingenuity 
and some hard work, a room can be made beautiful and home- 
like. : 
I believe thoroughly that out in the counties especially we 
should lay hold upon this one tangible thing,—utilizing the 
school house and establishing a little extension work, and help- 
ing in the same. (Applause). 
THE CHAIR: Superintendent Sheats of Florida is not 
present. Mrs. Cora Wilson Stewart is in the room, however, 
and I am sure you will hear with great pleasure this lady who 
has won such a reputation—Mrs. Stewart. 
THE CO-OPERATION OF THE WORK OF THE SEVERAL 
EDUCATIONAL, ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL 
ASSOCIATIONS OF THE SOUTH. 
MRS. CORA WILSON STEWART, MOREHEAD, KY. 
The captains of industry, who have so often in their greed 
for gain outstripped the philanthropist and the zealot, and have 
blazed the way and planted the flag of commerce in new terri- 
tory before the banner of human brotherhood was there un- 
furled, have led the way in this matter of co-operation. Every 
fresh development of industrial economy and efficiency in our 
own day has prepared the way in fact for every fresh effort of 
philanthropy, has indicated an awakened social conscience that 
ultimately would make it possible; every fresh facility for 
swift and direct communication has brought it nearer, and now 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  88 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
we have reached a point where we can see something of power 
as well as its immense significance in determining the whole 
trend of our modern civilization. Codperation is winning its 
way in every field, because, fundamentally, it is right, it is 
progress. Altruism, unselfishness and generosity have their 
foundation in codperation and it would seem that societies 
which have these virtues as their principles and purposes could 
come upon a basis of codperation with each other as readily as 
the commercial organizations can work under a codperative 
agreement. 
The women’s organizations of the South which are engag- 
ing so patiently and earnestly in efforts to uplift human kind 
cannot hope to reach the zenith of their strength and power 
struggling along separately and independently. They have 
separate interests of sufficient importance and one common aim 
of magnitude enough to demand a more effective system of 
operation and advancement than even any which dominates 
the great moneyed interests and makes their every stroke of 
gigantic success. The women’s societies in their various fields 
ere covering a wide range of altruistic thought and effort. The 
Federation of Woman’s Clubs is interested in education, library 
extension, civics and literature; the Daughters of the Revolu- 
tion are inculcating high ideals of American patriotism; the 
United Daughters of the Confederacy are emphasizing things 
memorial, historical, benevolent, educational and social; the 
Women’s Christian Temperance Union are promoting the 
causes of temperance and purity; the Young Woman’s Chris- 
tian Association, the Southern College Women’s Association, 
the Anti-Cigarette Leagues and many others are elevating the 
ideals of the Southern people, exemplifying a beautiful spirit 
of charity, sending literature into the isolated places, establish- 
ing libraries in the cities, reforming prison conditions, beauti- 
fying the waste places, providing scholarships for struggling 
youths and maidens, and making many other efforts toward the 
advancement of the people of the South. Not only are the 
Southern women in their organizations promoting the various 
causes well, but they are promoting them better than even the 
organizations of women in other sections of the country. The 
Southern women lead in the number of scholarships provided 
for young people struggling for an education; they lead in their 
efforts for civic improvement; they lead in successful effort in
-P-A-G-E-89
ee ee Ee Re hee ener 
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 89 
behalf of industrial education; they lead in the work of im- 
proving rural.schools. Southern women have been chosen as 
presiding officers, and have presided with dignity and wisdom 
over almost every national organization of women of any con- 
sequence, one of them being at present the head of the National 
Federation of Women’s Clubs, one of the most wonderfully 
organized and skillfully managed and highly respected organ- 
izations on the globe. I relate these facts not in any spirit of 
boastfulness, but merely to draw the conclusion that if these 
organizations moving along their individual and independent 
lines have succeeded and have surpassed similar organizations 
in other sections, what could they not do if they would combine 
forces and codperate together upon some systematic and agreed 
and adopted basis? Matthew Arnold said, “If the time shall 
ever come when the women of the world shall come together 
simply for the benefit of humanity, it will be a power such as 
the world has never known,” and I believe if all the organiza- 
tions composed of women and fostered by women in the South 
could be brought to work together upon some well-formulated 
system of codperation, that a wonderful impetus would be given 
immediately to each and mighty power to all. The weak or- 
ganizations can readily see the advantage and will grasp at 
such a system; it is the strong, which feels sufficient unto itself, 
that must needs be convinced, but it must be remembered that 
the most precious privilege of the strong is succoring the weak. 
This is life at its best. 
To propose a definite system for the closer organization 
of the various societies of Southern women is not my aim or 
purpose. It will require time and experience to work out ef- 
fectively a plan. I would merely suggest that such an effort be 
begun. The first step perhaps would be recognition; we cannot 
codperate with one whom we do not recognize. The next is 
investigation; we cannot codperate intelligently with an organ- 
ization whose workings we do not know. Official recognition 
by each organization of the others on its programme, and offi- 
cial invitation by each to the others to attend its sessions, 
would be an act of womanly courtesy and graciousness, as well 
as a step toward codperation. A report of the aims and achieve- 
ments of each organization to the members of the one assem- 
bled, and a report carried back by delegates to their own con- 
vention would serve two purposes,—the dissemination of in-
-P-A-G-E-90
    90 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
formation and the extension of codperation. But, for my part, 
I should like to see all the women’s organizations of the South 
come together in a delegate convention to formulate and adopt 
a platform which should constitute a common working basis 
for their various societies. I would have them in this conven- 
tion to employ the persistence, the adroitness, the diplomacy, 
the business acumen employed in a political convention, with- 
out any of the political trickery and chicanery which oftentimes 
permeates such conventions. The very first essential of secur- 
ing this broad platform of coédperative effort is of course that 
all these organizations should lay aside any petty jealously that 
may exist among them. Not until the thirteen colonies were 
willing to sink in a large measure their jealousies and codperate 
was it possible to form this republic, and the educational, eco- 
nomic and commercial associations of the South have no inter- 
ests that cannot be harmonized as easily as were the interests 
of the thirteen colonies harmonized and subserved to the estab- 
lishment of these United States. 
I would not advocate, by any means, the narrowing of co- 
operative effort among women to their own exclusive organiza- 
tions. Codperation with their brothers in their societies is as 
desirable and as beneficial as codperation with their sisters in 
theirs, and particularly is it expedient that all associations, 
whether educational, economic or commercial in nature, should 
manifest a broad and generous spirit of co-operation toward 
the Southern Educational Association, which stands for the 
advancement of the cause of education in the South. It is the 
one around which all the others, it seems to me, should center 
in their codperative efforts, and when it is convened in annual 
session every other organization should be keenly alive to the 
great event and it should hold within its audience delegates 
from every educational, economic and commercial association 
in the South; for let all who have plans to promulgate or aim 
to achieve remember that education is of itself the foundation 
of all codperation and that if they are interested in civics, 
health, roads, commerce, art or whatnot, they must be inter- 
ested, too, in education, for unless it makes progress the others 
cannot make any material advancement. Ignorance cannot co- 
dperate, and this Association, which stands preéminently for 
the one great cause of stamping out illiteracy from the South, is
-P-A-G-E-91
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 91 
one which has broken ground for the seed of codperative effort, 
therefore is entitled to share largest in its benefits. 
THE CHAIR: Hon. Sidney G. Gilreath, who was also to 
have discussed this topic, is absent, so we will now have Dr. 
Bradford Knapp, of Washington, D. C.—“The Farmer, His 
Family, and the School.” 
THE FARMER, HIS FAMILY, AND THE SCHOOL. 
BRADFORD KNAPP, WASHINGTON, D. C. 
Dr. BRADFORD KNAPP: As I can say what I have to say in 
fifteen minutes, you will pardon just a personal reference. It 
is a great personal pleasure to meet with this Association; be- 
cause of the fact that whether consciously or unconsciously 
you who are engaged in that part of education which relates to 
the country life have been my most valued coadjutors, and I 
want to take this occasion for thanking you, and through you 
the other educators of the South for the aid and assistance so 
graciously given in their work toward the work we are irying 
to do. 
It is also a great personal pleasure for me to be here today 
for another reason. You know that sometimes we think that 
day dreams never come true. This occasion is one that dis- 
proves that. About twenty-four years ago there was sitting 
in practically this same room—it has been destroyed since and 
rebuilt—on one of the benches in that part of the room, a 
young man on an important occasion when a gentleman of 
some national importance was speaking to the student body, 
and the thought crossed his mind if it would ever be possible 
for him to go out and do a work sufficiently great or sufficiently 
important to make such an impression on the world that he would 
have an opportunity to stand upon this platform and address an 
audience, it would be the height of his ambitic 
of work. My friends, the young man is sta 
now. 
I am in the embarrassing situation of } 
some things that have been said by speakers   
  
-P-A-G-E-92
   
     92 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
and possibly I am also trespassing upon the ground of much 
abler speakers who may follow in this delightful program. I will 
beg your pardon for the repetition, and apologize to them for 
the trespass. The topic is of sufficient importance to warrant 
a few observations from one who lays no claim to being an 
educator in the school sense of the word. 
A glance at the program of this interesting and important 
conference is ample proof of the great and growing interest in 
every branch of education, but more especially of that part of 
education which relates to the country people. 
Certain pronounced and alarming tendencies raise the seri- 
ous question, “Have we an effective system of rural education?” 
These tendencies are: 
(1) The growth of tenantcy and the corresponding de- 
crease in occupying ownership of land. This is not confined to 
poor sections, but seems to be equally serious in the richest and 
best agricultural sections. A tenant agriculture never pro- 
duced a great rural civilization. 
(2) Rapid growth of cities at the evident expense of the 
country. 
(8) The failure of country life to hold and attract its 
best boys and girls, men and women. 
(4) <A lack of universal application of known better meth- 
ods of agriculture on the farms, and hence a failure of produc- 
tion to keep pace with our needs, low earning capacity and too 
little regard for conservation of soil fertility. 
(5) And, to my mind, most important of all, a lack of at- 
tention to the country home, the woman’s side of country life, 
and hence the unattractive home, the product partly of all of 
these tendencies, the cause of some of them, the certain depopu- 
lator of the country, the source of growth of city and town. 
I wish I might have time to dwell on some, if not all, of 
these problems, but twenty minutes will not be sufficient to do 
justice to even one of them. Each is more or less related to the 
other, and all most profoundly concern the educator. Through 
education, after all, we shall find the best and truest solution of 
these difficulties.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 93 
Let me illustrate the influence of circumstances and the lack 
that lies in many a country home, by a few answers recently 
made by a country boy of sixteen in one of the neighboring 
Southern States to questions sent him and others by a devoted 
student of country life. This country boy was trying to get a 
good education at the nearby town high school. When asked 
what he expected to do as a life work, he answered, “Become a 
politician.” His objections to country life were summed up in 
the simple but comprehensive statement, “Bad roads, bad 
schools.” Further questions elicited these significant facts: For 
younger children there were no community amusements, for 
older ones only an occasional candy-pull or “speaking” at the 
school. (Not very amusing, either, if my personal memory 
serves me aright.) There were no gatherings for games. Teach- 
ers did not lead in games or amusements. This boy read four 
papers including one on agriculture, and there was a library of 
one hundred books in his home, among which he mentions “Tom 
Sawyer,” “David Copperfield” and “Richard Carvel.” The water 
for the home on that farm has to be carried by hand seventy-five 
yards from the well to the house, while that for the stock is 
handy in the barn lot or yard. The farm has the following im- 
proved farm tools: Mowing machine, hay rake, grain drill, rid- 
ing cultivator, a disc plow, and a corn sheller. The labor-saving 
conveniences for the home include only a sewing machine. 
, There are no closets at the country school near the home, no san- 
itary closets in the neighborhood, and at least four of the near 
neighbors have no closets. And finally this boy declares that the 
greatest needs for a more attractive country life in that com- 
munity are improved roads, improved schools, and better tele- 
phone service. 
This is better than a fair example of what may be found in 
many acommunity. The unattractive home, the inefficient farm, 
the uninspiring schools must bear the burden of rural lack of 
progress. I do not mean to say that all of the rural life is like 
this. There are shining examples of better homes, the splendid 
farm and the most inspiring schools, each of which is a center 
of influence for a better rural life. Such examples are the hope 
of the future. 
I would not think it wise to criticise, or belittle, what has 
been done in education; indeed, no one who knows of the many, 
many cases of self-sacrifice, the innumerable instances of great  
-P-A-G-E-94
  94 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
devotion on the part of the country school teacher, struggling 
against adverse conditions, can bring himself to be critical of 
the work that is being done. It has improved in the past, it will 
improve in the future. But in that improvement we should keep 
watch of certain fundamental needs. What we desire to bring 
about is such a system of education as will develop not only a 
love of country life, but a full a successful and efficient country 
life,—a country life that not only means good farming, fertile 
lands, economic production, wise systems of codperative mar- 
keting, but a country life that means happy homes and influ- 
ential schools united in the teaching of all of those things which 
go to make up its life and the developing of moral character 
and culture in the community. 
It sometimes seems to me that we have neglected to appre- 
ciate all of the sources from which the individual receives an 
education. The complete education of any man or woman comes 
practically from three sources: (1) from experience; (2) from 
the written or spoken word; (8) from association with indi- 
viduals, and the influence of surrounding circumstances. 
Most of us over-emphasize the value of the written and 
spoken word and under-value experience by contact with things, 
or hand knowledge. Both are essentially necessary for complete 
mastery of the subject. 
Another lack in our system is the failure of the school and 
the home to codperate in the education of the child. This is a 
difficult task and one well nigh impossible where the country 
school teacher stays but a year or two in a place, and therefore 
can not enter fully into the life and ambitions of the entire com- 
munity. It is also due to the fact that the school is often times 
regarded by the parent as a convenient place to get rid of the 
care of the children for a certain number of hours each day, 
rather than as an able supplement to such instruction as may 
be given in the home. 
We need, therefore, it seems to me, to think seriously upon 
the following points: 
(1) How may school teaching be made a life work, with 
permanent employment so as to make the teacher an important 
factor in the community development? 
(2) How may fuller and better relations be established 
between the home and the school?
-P-A-G-E-95
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 95 
(3) How may part of the school’s efforts be directed to- 
wards home and farm efficiency? 
(4) How may we obtain community interest through the 
schools and the homes by the development of community leaders? 
As I have tried to intimate, one of the chief reasons for 
much of the failure of country life is because the farmer and the 
farmer’s family do not know, or have no way of finding out, how 
to apply science and education to the tasks of their every-day 
life on the farm and in the home. 
Until recent years, our attitude is best illustrated by a story 
I told at this place a couple of years ago. It is related that in 
the ancient times there was a great philosopher in Arabia, much 
loved and honored because of his great wisdom. Once upon a 
time he came to a large gathering of his people and stood before 
them and asked this question: “How many of you know what I 
am going to say?” and, thinking to please him, they said: “All 
of us.” He turned and left them, and they ran after him and 
persuaded him to come back, and he appeared before them 
again and asked the same question, and again, thinking to 
please him, they said: “None of us,” and he turned and walked 
away and left them. But again he was persuaded to come back, 
and again he propounded the same question, and this time their 
answer was: “Sir, some of us know, and some of us do not 
know.” Then the philosopher said: “Let those of you who know 
tell those who do not know,” and he turned and walked away. 
Much of our agriculture, and a large part of our home 
economy in the past, has been such as was inherited from one 
generation to another, or acquired in a hap-hazard way by 
those who know imparting the information to those who do 
not know, and often the knowledge was uncertain or inaccurate. 
But things are changing now; efforts are being put forth 
to instruct the adult farmers in better methods of agriculture. 
It is not my purpose, at this time, to trace the development of 
this great movement, nor of its important branches,—the Boys 
Corn Club and the Girls Canning Clubs. These are familiar 
to every Southern educator. You have seen the codperation be- 
tween these movements and the schools, and the resulting in- 
fluence not only upon the boy and the girl, and the school, but 
upon the home and the farm. In their development in the fu- 
ture I feel confident that they will continue to codperate most
-P-A-G-E-96
  96 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
closely with the educational activities within the community, 
the county, and the state. I can make this statement with reas- 
onable emphasis so long as the present director is in charge of 
_ that work. 
It may be interesting to you to know that practically every 
civilized country today has become aroused upon this very ques- 
tion of education for youth and adult among its country people. 
The systems differ in different lands, but the means is the same, 
the union of practical instruction from experts and the efforts 
of schools along the same lines. 
It is a false principle to think that education should stop 
when school life is finished. The young man and woman out of 
school, and the young man and woman upon the farm need the 
ministration of educational efforts almost as badly as the child. 
Without it, development is retarded. I am a firm believer in 
the continuation schools, in places close to the people, where 
practical instruction can be obtained on any given subject. It 
is possible for a traveling teacher, or demonstration agent, to 
practically revolutionize the farming of a county in a few years. 
I could give you repeated examples where this has been done, 
but if we had the school a center of influence for a county, or 
even a smaller division, consolidated so that the school teacher 
might be a permanent resident of the community, employed for 
a life work, and at that center would give instructions not only 
to children but in the winter time, and indeed, at any time, to 
adults as well. If they could minister to their wants and fur- 
nish them helpful, kindly advice in the things of their every- 
day life, then would we have education that would commence 
to make country life attractive. 
I realize that in saying these things I am echoing the de- 
sire of every one of you present who has come in contact with 
this great problem. The expert in agriculture who advises the 
farmer, traveling from farm to farm, and demonstrating better 
methods of farming, becomes interested in the school and will 
always be found ready to codperate with it. His task is to build 
a better farm, home and country life, and he knows that the 
future farmer and the future farmer’s wife are as important to 
that program as the present, and indeed more so. 
In such a school, the leaders can well take cognizance of 
the things that are being done at home and upon the farm. The
-P-A-G-E-97
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 97 
boy who is in the corn club, or the pig club, or the soil improve- 
ment club, and the girl who is in the canning club, or the cook- 
ing club at home may well have his or her standing at school 
influenced by this important practical side of education. I hope 
the time will come when the conduct and the pursuits of the 
boy and girl at the home will have their direct bearing upon 
their standing within the school. Such an inter-relation will 
bring them to understand the importance of the education they 
are receiving in the school, and its bearing on their after life. 
Time would forbid me from dwelling upon examples that 
may be mentioned,—the night schools in Kentucky, the con- 
tinuation schools in some of the states, and the schools for boys 
beyond the school age; the numerous instances of communities 
transformed by the school reaching out to the home, and the 
home becoming a part of the school. The county agricultural 
school, or the country life school, the district school of agricul- 
ture, the Normal College, and the College of Agriculture all 
have their bearing upon this great problem. It is when we 
remember that more than 90 per cent. of the school children in 
the country never receive higher than a common school educa- 
tion, that we realize the importance of linking the cultural, the 
theoretical, and the practical together and continuing the in- 
structions beyond the school age. 
If we are to have community life, and especially to de- 
velop coéperative production, codperative marketing, and co- 
6perative finance in this country, we must develop the educa- 
tion that makes for community interest. 
In Denmark, this summer, I realized that in most of their 
codperative societies the distinct effort was to bring up the 
poorer member of the community,—to make all equally efficient 
by educating those who most need it. Their whole problem of 
rural life is centered around the word “efficiency.” They seek 
to standardize methods of farming, types of animals kept, and 
high quality of product shipped out. The philosophy of the 
“pull” and the “David Harum’ standard of “doing the other 
fellow as he would do you, only doing it first” must be eradi- 
cated as an American principle of ethics. Honest, open, fair 
dealing and high ideals of honor in trade must be instituted 
in its stead. 
It is a long road, and the field is broad enough to attract 
and interest all in country life. In its solution we should ex- 
€ 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  98 - SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
emplify the principles of codperation by sinking personal jeal- 
ousy in a conscientious effort to develop in American rural life 
high standards,—mental, moral and physical. 
It will take work, patient work; it will require the devel- 
opment of broad, capable leadership. It must make for the 
country school teacher and the agricultural instructors a life 
work devoted to the upbuilding of the present and the onward 
march of the future. 
THE CHAIR: We will now hear from Hon. J. M. Gwinn, 
Superintendent of Schools, New Orleans, La., “Health in School 
Work.” 
HEALTH IN THE SHCOOL. 
J. M. GWINN, NEW ORLEANS, LA. 
A newcomer recently knocked at the door of the school. He 
demanded to be admitted, to be enrolled, and to be given a 
seat beside “Education.” Rosy-cheeked, deep-chested, strong 
of limb he was. His name was “Health.” He had long been 
barred from the school and so had chased over hill and down 
dale, climbed trees, and dived to the depths of the old swimming 
hole. How in contrast sat his seat-mate Education—nervous, 
bespectacled-eyed, narrow-chested, sallow-cheeked, and bulbous- 
brained. Who, if in some unguarded moment slipped from his 
phychic pedestal to the depths of biologic boydom and romped 
with Health out among the trees or down the alleyways, was 
called a truant and was made to suffer for his lapse. 
Mr. Pedagogue stood aghast at the thought of having this 
troublesome fellow in school. He was already burdened to death 
to provide for Education. Education was a voracious feeder, 
but a dyspeptic assimilator. Mr. Pedagogue had to provide daily 
a bill of fare with not less than twelve courses and because of 
the poor mastication and weak digestion and faulty assimilation 
of Education he had to serve each of these courses in different 
yet tempting ways each day. Health was going to interrupt the 
program of recitations and disturb the balance of time among 
the studies. He would find fault with his seat and books, inter- 
fere with the patent ventilation and modern heating appliances. 
He would surely be a disturbing element in school. Why must 
he come to interfere with the work of Education?
-P-A-G-E-99
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 99 
Mr. School Director said the schools were already over- 
crowded and the revenues not adequate to meet the needs for 
teachers’ salaries, library, and text books, supplies, repairs, and 
new buildings. How could Health be received since he would 
rob Education of time and needed teachers and helps, besides 
causing large expenditures on his own account. It was impos- 
sible to meet the expense of having Health in the schools. 
Yet, in spite of traditions and the protests from the teacher 
and the poverty of the school boards, Health is in the schools 
and is there to stay. 
Why did Health come to school? Men found out that in pro- 
portion to the time, energy, and money spent on Education that 
the returns were frightfully disappointing. An investigation 
was ordered and it was discovered that many of the avenues to 
the mind of Education were stopped and that the power of Edu- 
cation was often wasted through the breakdown of the machin- 
ery he must use to do his work. Thousands of facts have been 
collected from school and other reports and from investigations 
and researches which conclusively show that Education depends 
on Health for its development and for its expression in results. 
The old time idea that Education and Health are incompatible 
has been disproved and more, for Education is impossible with- 
out Health and also useless. These statistics show that eight 
out of ten school children need the doctor, or the dentist, or the 
occulist. 
The child with no defects moves forward in his school 
course, while the child with defective teeth, defective breathing, 
hypertrophied tonsils, adenoids, or enlarged glands lingers in 
the grades and so loses time or drops out of school altogether. 
All investigations of the great loss due to slow progress and 
elimination of pupils from the school lead into the field of Health. 
While physical defects that could be remedied and preventable 
diseases are not the only causes of retardation and elimination, 
they do cause a loss which accounts for a large per cent. of the 
failures in the struggle of life. 
One of the greatest factors in keeping down the efficiency 
of the school is irregular and poor attendance. The greatest 
number of absences is due to ill health. To eliminate loss of 
days from school, Health must be in the school.

Teaching is hard work and many a teacher is called from 
her desk to go in search of Health. Days are lost and other days 
are worth but little, when Health is gone, or impaired. Health 
must come to school to make better teachers and to preserve 
them in their places. 
The belief that this life is a wilderness of woe and vale of 
tears has little hold on people now. No more do we mortify the 
body, despise it and health. Life and happiness have been found 
to be good in and for themselves. The function of the school 
has been enlarged to include the building up and preserving of 
the physical as well as the mental and moral self. Health is 
needed to give life and happiness now recognized good ends in 
themselvs. 
In the fourth place Health came to school for his own sake. 
He is not the best sort of fellow when he runs wild. He needs 
care and training in order to serve the ends of society. Provi- 
dence is no longer considered an adequate guide and guardian 
of Health. Disease and Defects may meet him on his way or 
follow him from his birth or from forbears unknown. Asso- 
ciation with Education makes Health worth while. Mere exist- 
ence and buoyant Health are lesser values alone, but with mind 
dependent upon them they loom large. Health alone has worth, 
but not great. Education alone has value, but little. But when 
Education is coupled with Health the value of each increases a 
thousand fold. 
What has Health brought to school with him? Hardly an 
element of the school whether material or educational has not 
felt the influence of the presence of Health in the school. The 
location and size of the school grounds, the architect plans in 
detail of size and height of building, length, breadth, and height 
of class room, placing of windows, method of heating and ventil- 
ating, color of walls, location and tread of stairs, placing of 
shops and gymnasiums, all these have been under the direct in- 
fluence of the demands of Health. 
The material equipment has alike been transformed under 
the same influence. The old slab seat has been replaced by the 
modern chair desk. The crayon, the eraser, the pencil, the paper, 
and the pen, all have had their form and material changed to 
satisfy the requirements of Health. Health selects the paper 
for text books, the size and kind of type for printing them,
-P-A-G-E-101
    
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 101 
places the pictures on the page, and determines the length of 
the lines. Health has shaped the copy books and dictated shapes 
of letters and habits in writing. He has brought physical train- 
ing and much of manual work into the curriculum. Medical in- 
spection, dental inspection, free medical and dental treatment 
have come into the school at the call of Health. He has deter- 
mined the length of the recitation and study periods and of the 
school day. He has shaped the program of studies and ordered 
the daily shedule. 
Health has transformed the course in physiology and hy- 
giene from a dry, uninteresting and lifeless rattling of bones 
and enumeration of muscles and nerve cells to a living, func- 
tioning, and habit-forming study that deals with problems in 
home and school and city, as well as with purely personal mat- 
ters. The transformation of the course in hygiene is well shown 
by a comparison of the topics treated in the first and second 
years of the present course of study in New Orleans, adopted in 
August, 1913, with the former course adopted in 1909. In 1909, 
for the first year the outline was as follows: Body—name and 
location of parts, head, neck, trunk, limbs, hands, and feet. Head 
—crown, back, sides, hair. Face—ear, nose, forehead, eyes, 
chin, cheek. Hyes—position, use, protection, and care. The 
1913 course of study for the same grade shows: Skin—bathing, 
how and how often; why. Experiment 1—To teach proper 
bathing: : 
After several hours of school work have one pupil wash his hands in a 
pint of cold water without soap, one in a pint of warm water without soap, 
one in a pint of cold water with soap, one in a pint of warm water with 
soap. Let class observe results in cleanliness of hands and of dirt removed 
in the water and decide which is best. 
Hair—cleanliness, combing, brushing. Nails—care, clean- 
liness, harm of biting. Cleanliness of Surroundings—room and 
yard, drainage, removal of paper and lunch waste. 
In the second year in the 1909 course, we taught breathing, 
food, bones, muscles, sleep, and effect of alcohol on bones. In 
1913 we taught cleanliness of the home. Sleeping Rooms—no 
dust or food about to attract flies, fresh air, sleeping with win- 
dows open summer and winter. Kitchen—keeping food covered 
from insects, attractiveness of general cleanliness, disposal of 
kitchen waste. Yard—what yard cleanliness is; children’s abil- 
ity to keep yard neat, how to dispose of trash and waste. Clean-
-P-A-G-E-102
  102 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
liness as a Defense of the Body—prevention of skin roughness 
and sores. Preserving the teeth, especially the six-year molars. 
Composition of Dirt—a study of molds and dirty water. Three 
experiments are detailed to show the work of germs when dirty 
hands come in contact with food. 
Health did not enjoy this shut-in life of the school room. 
He lost some of the color from his cheeks and elasticity from his 
step. He remembered the delights of the open air and growing 
bold invited Education to come out of doors. Mr. Pedagogue 
followed and now all over the land open air schools are monu- 
ments to the influence of Health in the schools. 
The migration toward the out-of-doors is one of the most 
significant and characteristic tendencies of today. After cen- 
turies of confinement in caves, huts and houses and after all the 
architectural triumphs of modern house building man is disap- 
pointed in the results and longs. for the open air and the roomy 
space of the great out-of-doors. 
Rapid growth of our urban population with a corresponding 
decreasing percentage of people remaining in the country has 
characterized the past fifty years. This movement has built up 
great cities crowded with dwellers in flats and tenement build- 
ings. Out of their homes, the inhabitants labor in the smoke 
and dust and din of the great shops and factories or shut them- 
selves in sky-scraping commercial and office buildings while the 
childhood and youth of the city are housed by hundreds and 
thousands in school buildings with but meagre space for work 
and play. These conditions have of necessity cut off from home 
and school and place of daily toil much of air, light, sunshine, 
and opportunity to enjoy the beauties of nature and to exercise 
under the open sky. The enormous growth of tuberculosis, of 
defects of vision and of nervous diseases are but three of a score 
or more of increasing human ills due to the shut-in-doors life 
of the people. The advances in medical and surgical skill have 
been barely able to hold their own in the struggle for the life and 
health of the people against these multiplying diseases so that 
the race has been denied the lengthened years of life and more 
abounding health which its genius could give it. The conserva- 
tion of our national resources is a plank in every political plat- 
form and occupies an important position in the program of all 
movements for economic and social betterment. The health of
-P-A-G-E-103
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 103 
the people is the greatest of our national assets. It is the func- 
tion of the school to conserve and promote this most valuable 
resource. 
No one can compute the loss in health and in the efficiency 
of the school due to the presence of overheated, dust and germ- 
ladened foul air and the absence of sufficient moisture, light and 
sunshine in our school rooms. Nor can anyone tell to what ex- 
tent stupidity and the retardation and elimination of pupils may 
be due to bad physical conditions in shut-in school rooms. The 
economic loss is great for instruction to a brain-fagged child 
is largely wasted and millions are spent on educating children 
who die before reaching their twentieth birthday. 
Work in the open air is far more effective than any in the 
most modern school room with the most approved system of 
ventilation, and living both day and night in the open air heals 
many a disease which medicine cannot cure. 
School architecture in Southern cities should not be pat- 
terned after that of the North. The influence of latitude has 
hardly been strong enough to counteract imitation. We live in 
a land where hardly more than half of the school days require 
artificial heat and little discomfort is felt from living out-of- 
doors all the year round. 
Starting in Carlottensburg, a suburb of Berlin, about nine 
years ago the open-air school has spread till two years ago 
twenty-eight cities in the United States had forty-seven open-air 
schools. We have two in New Orleans. An annex was needed 
at one of our schools and as an experiment a four-room building 
was constructed. This building has wide extended eaves to cut 
off some of the direct rays of the sun and two sides to each room, 
cut in sections and swung by large hinges to supporting col- 
umns. Each of these sections has a window or door in it. These 
sections can be swung out at right angles and attached by a hook 
to a ring in the overhanging eave. By this means, two sides may 
be entirely open or partially open or entirely closed on bad days 
when the room becomes the ordinary closed school room, with 
it full quota of doors and windows. This building is used for 
normal children and with much success. 
Health demands that the Southern school building should be 
largely an open-air building.

The modern school must give large place to Health. It 
must be a combination of sanitarium, playgrounds, and school. 
Not all school, for then too often Health is lost or not promoted; 
not all sanitarium or playgrounds, for intellectual education 
would be largely wanting. 
THE CHAIR: This topic will now be discussed by Hon. R. P. 
Green, Western Kentucky State Normal School, Bowling Green, 
Ky. Ve 
HEALTH IN SCHOOL’ WORK. 
R. P. GREEN, BOWLING GREEN, KY. 
The question of health is fundamentally an educational 
problem. For several years a campaign has been waged for 
aggressive health work in every state, county and city, for better 
health conditions. The paramount issue has been prevention. 
It has been held by the intelligent public and professional men 
of the nation that the school must recognize and teach the laws 
of more efficient life. These truths must be known of all men 
that germs are transmissible and are carried by many agents; 
that diseases are caused by poisons; that these poisons kill as 
dead as any poison whether natural or artificial; that poison is 
poison whether from strychnine or sputum of tuberculosis pa- 
zient or injection by a mosquito or contamination of common 
house fly; that death due to these poisons is murder if it can be 
prevented, and forty-seven out of every hundred deaths can be 
prevented; that disease undermines the body, dwarfs its ability 
to do its share in the world’s work; decreases its efficiency and 
presses down the burden of society and breaks human hearts 
with sorrow and grief; that unsanitary conditions are criminal. 
Sanitary conditions of a community reflect the patriotism of its 
people, for if people will learn that scattering poison in milk, 
water, food and air, and permitting men to do so, is as much 
murder as to kill with a revolver; then the poisonous, filthy, un- 
sanitary conditions of many homes, schools, factories, public 
buildings, barns and jails will become history. ‘The modern 
health movement has for its aim through school, press and health 
boards to render “growth more perfect, decay less rapid, life 
more vigorous, and death more remote.” 
To get the gospel of science which can save a man from a 
great part of sickness, to a mass of people is the most gigantic

of tasks. The problem has not been solved as is evidenced by 
the fact that within the United States at all times about 3,000,- 
000 people are seriously ill, of whom nearly 1,500,000 die an- 
nually, 630,000 of whom could have been saved by the use of 
information known to medicine. It is evident that more hard, 
earnest assiduous work must be done, not by one, but by many 
agents to ameliorate the horrible conditions. The school must 
lead the crusaders into the Holy Land of prevention through the 
highway of cleanliness and light the way by the searchlight of 
education. It is therefore evident that the school must do more 
than it has done, and by so doing, it will be achieving a public 
service far beyond any work it now does, or ever will do. The 
care of the community health should be the first object of the 
school. It should be the first obligation of the teacher. The 
greatest factor in increasing the mental life of the school is in- 
creasing its physical efficiency. The school must be the most 
potent factor in contagion of health. We are just now getting 
out of the Dark Ages of health work. For the brilliant accom- 
plishments of antiseptic surgery, the marvelous exploits of 
heroic daring for better health are offset by the thousands who 
still use liverwort for jaundice; who spend hard-earned money 
for patent blood tonics and consumption cures, who poison them- 
selves with Lydia Pinkham’s compounds; who stuff their babies’ 
stomachs with green apples, vegetables, dried herring, sour pick- 
les, bananas, bacon and pot liquor; who permit flies whose 
breeding place is filth to swarm over their own food and the 
food of their offspring and then wonder why they are always 
sick. The wonder is that both are not dead. 
The human race treads a thorny path and dangerous jour- 
ney from the cradle to the grave, made doubly dangerous by 
disregard of hygienic laws. Look at the infant scarcely an hour 
old, if it has escaped infection before it saw light of day, when 
its consumptive mother, ignorant of danger, kisses it; a little 
later, the father with tainted breath opens the portals of charnel 
house and contributes his daily infections; the bachelor uncle 
with lips barbed with loathsome poison, fires his deadly shafts 
into the innocent body; and not a word is spoken or an arm 
raised in defense of the child. The mother murders, perchance, 
her own offspring by allowing the nurse, perhaps an innocent 
victim of hideous infection, to administer the daily dose of milk 
from a tuberculosis cow, sipping the deadly draught through 
 
-P-A-G-E-106

polluted lips or cooling it with fetid breath. Is it any wonder 
that one-fourth of these babies die before one month, or that 
fifty per cent. die before the end of the first year? A little later 
in its life, if perchance it has miraculously survived the ordeal, 
the poor waif of ignorance, fed on poor food, drinking water 
with sewerage from some babbling brook polluted by a city, or 
possibly quenching his thirst from the old open bucket which no 
longer furnished the fond recollection of a once glorious child- 
hood, but rather sighing pean or last wail of suffering humanity, 
oscillates between infected pencils, “swapped” chewing gum, 
school dippers, drinking cups and water made foul by dead rats, 
snakes and frogs. The fond mother closes every window from 
fear of night air, sweeps the room with dry broom and scatters 
poison for her darling’s lungs. The survivor, budding into glo- 
rious womanhood is initiated into the mysteries of “Love’s 
Young Dream” whose open sesame is polluted too frequently 
with microbian infection. After such a picture, who then dares 
believe that all has been done that can or ought to be done for 
health? Who, then dares not to think that the wonderful resist- 
ance of the human system is the only factor that prevents it 
perishing from the earth? 
The cost of this ignorance to the nation in wages, prevent- 
able death, physical inefficiency, medical aid, grief and sorrow is 
stupendous. The general adoption of a few well known and es- 
established principles of hygiene would add fifteen years to the 
span of life. These years are usually the years of greatest pro- 
ductivity. Premature death entails such loss to the state eco- 
nomically, as it withdraws the individual from productive indus- 
try, when his physical vigor would give him the greatest effi- 
ciency. This loss amounts to five times the amount spent for 
education. The waste is greater than the waste of our natural 
resources. This waste of human resources, this slaughter of 
innocents will continue until the new generation has been edu- 
cated to obey the laws of health and each one has an altruistic 
regard for its fellows who must live on the same planet with 
him. From these facts and from a casual reflection regarding 
the problem of personal as well as public health, it must be clear 
that all health measures must be championed by school and made 
a cardinal policy in its course of study and daily teaching. The 
maintenance, development and conservation of national, state 
and community physical well-being are fundamental duties and

binding covenant. We are in a large way the trustees of national 
and community vitality! If we are faithless servants allowing 
our national virility to be depleted, physical and moral stamina 
to be exploited by poison of factory, stream and insidious mer- 
cenary commercialism of today, if we permit the lives of the 
future citizens to become prematurely and heedlessly wasted, 
when we shall give account of our stewardship, we shall hear the 
epithet unprofitable servant joined with outer darkness of na- 
tional respect and history will record us as traitors of human- 
ity’s greatest trust. It is the paramount duty of school to trans- 
mit to humanity and bequeath to society growing, vigorous citi- 
zens not pinched by mal-nutrition, not vitiated by sin, nor 
dwarfed by disease but undiminished in stature or vitality. The 
new patriotism demands a fulfillment of this vow. To do less is 
to acknowledge our inability or become recreant to sacred duty 
and commit a heinous crime. 
The great defect in modern education is that the teacher has 
not been trained in sanitary science. He has been expected by 
board examiners to know the names of bones of the body, the 
names of the muscles, the anatomy of the teeth, heart, and vari- 
ous organs, instead of carrying out the purpose of teaching phy- 
siology as making the health of school and community better. 
The teacher too often plunges the children into maze of technical 
detail from which they rarely escape. Things are taught that 
often doctors even do not care to know. They teach these things 
because this is the way they were taught. The teacher’s prepara- 
tion is deficient who does not know the principles of personal 
and community hygiene as well as the laws of physiology. The 
teacher should at least know the sanitary conditions of the com- 
munity as well as how to prevent “preventable diseases”; how 
these maladies are caused; the conditions favoring the growth 
and spread of germs as well as how they get into the human 
system; what constitutes sanitary and unsanitary conditions of 
homes, farms, schools, and factories; how to secure pure drink- 
ing water for school and home. He should teach the ways in 
which contamination and pollution of water come from barns, 
outhouses, cesspools; the safe disposal of garbage, sewage, re- 
fuse and slops from home and barns; flies, mosquitoes, cat and 
dog fleas, rats and cats as carriers of disease; the construction 
and location of homes, schools and barns as to the healthiness of 
the community.

The school through its teacher should help the community in 
its fight to free itself from the awful scourge of tuberculosis. 
The White Plague is frightful in the havoc it plays in the ranks 
of school children, as more than 2,000,000 children who succumb 
to its ravages attend school every day. The war against this 
horror will be won when the school takes up the fight in earnest. 
This can be secured only by medical inspection and fresh air 
treatment in open-air schools. The community which compels 
children to come to school is guilty of murder unless it protects 
them against this unspeakably horrible fate. The fresh air 
schools for such cases have met with such success in those places 
where the experiments have been made and the children improve 
so fast that normal children clamor for the privilege of fresh 
air. So any movement or work which will bring wholesome ex- 
ercise in open air will be a godsend. The more out-door work, 
the better. With the mild temperature of our Southern climate 
there is no reason why much of the school work could not be 
done out in God’s free air. All the amusements possible ought to 
be out in the open. Instructions in nature study, geography, 
botany and geology would multiply their value many fold if 
made vital by excursions. Two great discoveries have been 
made in modern times—the value of children and the value of 
fresh air. Yet one of the sad things connected with these dis- 
coveries is that the school which ought to emphasize faith in 
both, so often has neither. 
The maintenance of high standards of health conditions in 
school and promotion of whole process of education demand ul- 
timately for every child normal or defective such conditions of 
life compatible with full and complete development of its organic 
functions and mental powers as will not only detect communi- 
cable diseases and discover defects but as will maintain the health 
and vitality of the child. Effective medical inspection seeks to 
secure this goal. It asks not only for legal authority to protect 
the community from epidemics of contagion, but to prevent 
them. As further evidence of vigilant need of care, fifteen per 
cent. of our children suffer from mal-nutrition due not to what 
is eaten but to what is not digested. Many have plenty of food, 
but are ill-nourished. Much of this impoverishment is due to 
defective teeth. The school children of American carry 50,- 
000,000 decayed teeth to school every day, many of which are 
aching and produce ill humor, bad conduct and unhappiness.
-P-A-G-E-109
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 109 
The atmosphere of rooms is redolent of decaying teeth. Millions 
of bacteria harbor about these rooms and endanger the life and 
health of every one present. Inspection will detect these de- 
fects, parents will remedy evil, and the state will care for those 
who are not able. The percentage of dental caries far exceeds 
tubercular infection, yet it is the most easily preventable of all 
diseases known to civilization. The mouth is the most danger- 
ous cavity in the human body from a bacteriological point of 
view. Sanitary science must condemn kissing custom, or com- 
mend at least the French method of kissing the forehead, or 
even better the South Sea Islander’s custom of rubbing noses 
together as being less dangerous than the “osculating juncture 
of two protozoological gardens of bacterial horrors’ where 
microbes grin in glee, germs dig their holes and where spores 
sob and weep for other worlds to conquer. 
The school must extend the field of its influence into the 
field of social hygiene. It must stop the pollution of soils and 
water by the improper disposal of garbage, slops and refuse 
reeking with untold filth to become the breeding places of flies, 
the prolific source of contamination and danger to lives of the 
community. We must make the school not only a fit place in 
which to teach and a safe place for growing young life, but the 
instrument by which society is to achieve social justice. This 
can and will be done when teachers stop discussing which is 
best to say 100% equal base, or base equal 100%. Too much 
time is devoted to discussing the methods of teaching reading to 
children who will learn to read in spite of method and too little 
time for the real vital lessons of life. It is better for the child 
to know more about the methods of maintaing his own vitality 
than to know how the ancient taught reading. Better to know 
about the music of Anopheles mosquitoes than how the morning 
stars sang together. It is better for a child to know the anatomy 
of a tooth-brush than the anatomy of the tooth. 
The greater skill and increased efficiency of the human or- 
ganism can be accomplished by the use of every opportunity for 
growth and healthy development. The basis of efficient national 
life rests upon soils, farms, factories, railroads, but the glory of 
a nation is in its manhood or virility resting upon vigorous 
health. Keeping men’s bodies free from disease and hearts 
devoid of sin and thus allowing ideals of truth, honor and 
patriotism to take deep root in the subsoil of our national well 
   
-P-A-G-E-110

being has a greater glory than storing of gold and bonds. 
Greater genius is displayed in making two blades of grass grow 
where only one grew before. I believe we ought to conserve 
our national resources. But I believe more in the conservation 
of human life, for all conservation fails unless we can teach 
man to be fit and efficient. Our water power ought to be con- 
served, but I believe more in the conservation of the dynamic 
power of the human body in health and bodily vigor. We ought 
to quadruple the productivity of our soils, but more can be ac- 
complished by freeing the temple of the spirit from devastating 
diseases which make the garden of the human life unfit to pro- 
duce the rare plants of civilization. I believe in the con- 
servation of our forests, but I believe more in conserv- 
ing the physical basis of intellect, emotion, imagination and 
reason, which flourish upon red blood and well nourished 
brain. I believe in the prevention of soil erosion, but more 
in prevention of health erosion which furrows prematurely the 
human frame and make the emancipated body stand out 
in bold relief. I believe in conserving our minerals so abund- 
antly vouchsafed to us, but I believe more in giving the proper 
amounts of mineral elements for feeding the children. I be- 
lieve in saving the iron for making this the great iron age, 
but think more strength would be gained by putting more iron 
into the blood. I believe in conserving our democracy and 
cherishing the ideals of the fathers, as portrayed to us in the 
Constitution and Declaration, but I believe more could be added 
. to our national perpetuity and future stability and glory by 
conserving the substratum of all democracy, the individual 
citizen from impure blood, improper nourishment, deformity, 
blindness, small pox, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, filth disease, 
for every citizen has the right to be born with red blood in his 
veins and cells free from preventive poisons. 
The school will have accomplished its task when children 
have been inspired to show more heroism as guardians of pub- 
lic health and when they know something about the heroes of 
peace who have voluntarily marched into pestilence and pesti- 
lential districts to minister to the sick and dying and those 
other benefactors of the human race who have died that the 
world might know how to prevent some of our most virulent 
diseases. The names of these men should be emblazoned upon 
the shields of public schools and over the door-posts of our

homes that the angel of death may pass by. The rattle of mus- 
ketry and field of carnage are not the only things that make 
heroes. Men of great moral courage in the fields of health have 
made the achievements in war become the pigmies compared 
with the progress of these valiant warriors who fought so hero- 
ically, and walked down with firm and undaunted tread against 
the grim destroyer. The world stands amazed at the picture 
gallery of progress that these powerful personalities have made 
for civilization. The afterglow of their achievements lingers 
with us. Our children just catch the spirit of these men which 
has for its goal the solidarity of the race and for its motive the 
amelioration and eradication of suffering, for the world can 
not be happy while others suffer. Such heroic deeds hasten 
the day of universal codperation and the brotherhood of man, 
and the school shall lead them. 
THE CHAIR: Don Carlos Ellis, our next speaker, will ad- 
dress you upon the subject of “Forestry in Relation to Agri- 
culture.” 
FORESTRY IN AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 
DON CARLOS ELLIS, WASHINGTON, D. C. 
When I addressed this Association one year ago on the 
subject of “The Forest and the School,” I felt it necessary to 
apologize for suggesting the introduction of still another sub- 
ject into the already crowded school curriculum, and to explain 
that I was after all not truly suggesting an additional course, 
but merely endeavoring to supply to courses already estab- 
lished, such as geography and nature study, an element for 
which there was already a place waiting and without which 
such courses were incomplete. The topic upon which I am to 
talk today, however, gives me greater boldness and I feel that 
no apology is needed. Agricultural education is today only in 
its formative stage. Although men have been tilling the soil 
since the time of Adam, agricultural education is less than a 
century old. The first agricultural school established in this 
country was founded at Gardener, Maine, in 1821, and was 
forced in ten years, for lack of patronage, to discontinue as an 
agricultural school, for there was no demand in our country, 
even at so recent a date, for school instruction in the science 
of tilling the soil. Farming was considered a business which  
-P-A-G-E-112
  
112 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
a son had to learn from his father as an apprentice from his 
master, and not as a science that could be taught in an institu- 
tion of learning; and not until industrial education came into 
prominence has agricultural education found a place. Great 
progress in the work has been made since that time, but the 
science is far from complete and is still reaching out for new 
materials and new methods through which to develop greater 
efficiency upon our farms. 
Farm forestry stands at the door of the agricultural school, 
begging the chance to contribute its share in the development. 
The science of woodlot forestry is an important element in the 
science of agriculture, because the proper management of the 
farm woodlot must play an important part in the management 
of a completely successful farm. When we inspect the curric- 
ula of our agricultural high schools, such subjects as soils, 
fertilizers, crops and crop culture, live stock breeding and gen- 
eral farm management are found to occupy the field, but it is 
the exception that consideration of a place for the woodlot upon 
the farm is ever given mention; and most of our text-book 
writers seem also to have overlooked the part of the farm upon 
which timber is grown. And yet, most of the timber through- 
out the eastern portion of our country is to be found in farm 
woodlots. They are essential and necessary parts of the farms 
of which they are adjuncts, and the proper management of 
the timber crop would add materially to their owners’ incomes. 
Let us see if this is true. First, why does a farmer need a 
woodlot? The farmer is a heavy consumer of wood. It is his 
usual fuel, and, besides, he needs wood constantly for fence 
posts, for construction material and for many other purposes 
both in his fields and at his homestead. He should supply at 
least all the wood he needs for his own consumption from his 
farm. The farmer who devotes all his land to the production 
of yearly crops and purchases the timber he needs from neigh- 
bors, or perhaps from other states, at a much higher price 
than it would cost him to produce it at home, is as improvident 
as is the farmer who would plant all his field to cotton and 
purchase his corn, his hog meat, and his dairy products else- 
where. 
In some parts of the South, especially in and around Okla- 
homa and westward and near the sea coast, timber is also 
needed upon the farm for the protection which it affords to
-P-A-G-E-113
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 113 
fields, livestock, and the homestead against drying and mechan- 
ically destructive winds. It has been worked out to a nicety 
by experts in the forest service that groves and belts of drought 
resistant trees placed at certain intervals upon a farm in the 
semi-arid regions will greatly reduce the evaporation of mois- 
ture from the fields and thus greatly increase their production. 
Even in the East, orchards and field crops are in many places 
greatly benefited by the protection afforded by forest wind- 
breaks. This is especially true upon the sandy coastal plains 
in the South, where, on many farms, the encroachment of sand 
upon cultivated fields and orchards is effectively checked by 
the presence of a grove of trees on the windward side. Live- 
stock will need less food in winter to keep up body warmth 
and will be much more comfortable, and hence healthier, in 
summer if protected by a grove of timber in or adjacent to the 
pasture in which they graze. The homestead, too, is rendered 
more comfortable if protected by forest windbreaks from the 
drying winds and scorching sun of summer and the chilling 
winds of winter. In many places in our country, the presence 
of these shelter belts makes the difference between comfort 
and inhabitability. 
Granting then that the woodlot or forest shelter belt is 
needed upon our farms, the next question which might properly 
be suggested to the agricultural educators would be where the 
timber can best be placed. When the primary need for the 
woodland is the timber which it can supply, the woodlot can 
best be located upon what otherwise would be waste land, 
which is either too rocky, too steep, or too unfertile for success- 
ful production of yearly crops, or which, from its inconvenient 
location, is not convenient for early cultivation. The forest tree 
takes less than three per cent. of its nourishment from the soil. 
Most of its food comes from the air, and it can grow thriftily 
in a location where the successful production of yearly crops 
would be utterly impossible. There are suitable locations for 
the woodlot upon almost every farm. If the timber is permitted 
to grow upon a steep slope, not only will it thus occupy land un- 
suited for cultivation, but it will also hold the soil in place and 
prevent the soil wash which would follow an attempt at cultiva- 
tion. Oftentimes a stream runs through or upon the edge of a 
farm. If the fields are extended to the banks of the stream, the 
result is apt to be that the banks will break down and be washed 
8
-P-A-G-E-114
  114 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
away. A grove of trees left upon the banks will perform the 
double service of holding the banks in place by its entwining 
roots and produce a luxuriant growth of timber. Perhaps a 
corner of the farm is cut off from the rest by a railroad or a 
public highway, and, because separated from the main body of 
the land, is not as convenient for cultivation as the rest. Such a 
corner as this might be the most suitable location in which to 
leave the timber. In all these cases, the woodlot would not only 
be supplying a product needed upon the farm, but would also 
be occupying land which otherwise would be giving little or no 
service, land which if not in forest would bring a much smaller 
return to the owner of the land. 
In places where the timber is needed primarily for protec- 
tion from wind, the direction and nature of the prevailing winds 
during the growing season must be the first guides in placing 
the timber belts. In such locations as these, trees are not usu- 
ally native, and, since they must therefore be planted, placing 
them where they are needed is not a diffcult problem. 
While, as we see, the timber produced upon a farm may serve 
other purposes than the production of wood, these other pur- 
poses are only supplemental to the productive function. The 
woodlot is as truly a crop producer as the corn or the wheat 
field; the only difference is that in the latter cases the product 
is entirely matured and harvested annually, while in the forest 
the complete crop is not harvested so often, though it may be 
made to supply wood every year, or for that matter many times 
a year. 
The agricultural school teaches its students what methods to 
apply in order to get the highest value from a field of corn or a 
field of wheat. There is as much reason why that school should 
teach them how they may get the most out of the wood crop. 
One is as much of a science as the other, and both require the 
application of accurate scientific methods for efficient results. 
Just as the farm which lacks a woodlot is an incomplete farm, 
so the agricultural school which does not teach the principles 
of woodlot management fails in its purpose. As a result of the 
failure of many schools in this regard, many so-called “model” 
farms are to be found throughout the country today where the 
woodlot is utterly neglected, and consequently in a low state 
of production. Many progressive farmers today are on a par 
with their more unprogressive brethren in that they persist in
-P-A-G-E-115
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 115 
regarding the woodlot as a permanent, natural source of sup- 
ply, from which the timber they need is to be removed without 
particular care or special knowledge, and with no thought as 
to the effect which such handling will have upon the future con- 
dition of the stand. Usually when a farmer needs wood, even 
though it only be for fuel, he will select from his timber the 
straightest young limbless specimens he can find, which, if left 
for a few years, would increase greatly in volume and value, 
leaving perhaps a crooked, knarled, over-mature tree which 
has long before come to the end of its best rope and is only 
taking up room needed by the young trees about it. Perhaps 
the crooked specimen would have as fully met the needs of the 
farmer as the straight, thrifty specimen. The better specimen 
was perhaps of a more valuable species than the other, though 
for fire wood the other might have been just as useful. Let the 
farmer continue this practice for a few years and his woodlot 
deteriorates very fast. The best species and the more vigorous 
individuals disappear. The disease from the old trees spreads 
rapidly; too much light is permitted within the forest; weed 
trees and less valuable species become dominant, and before 
long the tract is at its lowest ebb as a producer of valuable 
wood. 
A farmer need not become a professional forester in order 
to know how to manage his woodlot properly, but he should be 
taught enough principles of the science and given a sufficiently 
broad understanding of the woodlot problem in his neighbor- 
hood to enable him to be his own forester and to manage his 
timber with the efficiency that he is also expected to manage 
the other departments of his farm. He should be taught the 
relative values and physical properties of the different kinds 
of timber which grow in his neighborhood; he should be taught 
enough of forest ecology to enable him to understand the gen- 
eral relations which the trees bear to each other in their com- 
munity life in the forest; he should know the life history of 
the individual trees and the forest as a whole; he should under- 
stand something of the light relations in tree growth; know 
which trees thrive best in deep shadow and which need much 
sun for their best development. He should also be taught how 
to measure timber upon the stump and in the log; what the 
market values of the different species are, and where to market 
his wood product most advantageously. The farmer would be
-P-A-G-E-116
  116 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
considered a failure at his business who would not know how 
to measure his cotton crop, nor where, nor how to market it; 
and yet, many farmers even today who, in other departments 
of their farm show highly developed and highly trained busi- 
ness ability, can easily be imposed upon by those to whom they 
sell their timber, merely because they do not possess the prin- 
ciples underlying timber measuration and valuation, which could 
be learned in a semester’s work at a properly equipped agri- 
cultural school. 
The fact that text book writers upon agriculture as well 
as the agricultural schools have given, up to this time, so little 
attention to forestry is probably due to the fact that they re- 
gard forestry as a science needed only by the lumberman and 
the professional forester. They have overlooked, just as the 
farmer himself has, that the real importance of forestry on 
the farm is its application to the management of the woodlot. 
As a result we find that, where text book writers have included 
a consideration of forestry in their works, the treatise usually 
has reference to such general features of forest influences as 
the relation of forests to stream flow and their place as a source 
of supply in wood using industries. These considerations be- 
long more to geography than to agriculture. Agricultural for- 
estry is a distinct and separate branch of the science, and should 
be treated as such. 
The failure of text book writers to include proper treat- 
ment of this subject in their books makes it extremely difficult 
for the agricultural schools to handle the subject. The patent 
need in this regard is now being met by the United States De- 
partment of Agriculture, which has in course of preparation a 
farmers’ bulletin on forestry in agriculture. This will be based 
upon experience derived from one month’s course in elementary 
forestry recently given in the Baltimore Agricultural High 
School at Sparks, Md. The course was carefully worked out by 
experts of the forest service in codperation with the efficient 
principal, Mr. B. H. Chrocheron. The course, however, is 
purely the result of an experiment and is therefore only sug- 
gestive and needs further development. I hope that the agri- 
cultural teachers who are members of this association will se- 
cure the bulletin when it becomes available and will give careful 
consideration to the introduction of some such course as out- 
lined into the school where they teach. The government is able
-P-A-G-E-117
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 117 
only to suggest the form in which such a course as advocated 
may be introduced. To carry it to a successful solution, the 
codperation of the teachers of the country, and especially of the 
members of such an organization as this, is needed. The gov- 
ernment is working for your benefit and for the benefit of the 
pupils whom you teach and of the community to which they will 
return, but if we are to accomplish anything we must have the 
codperation of you teachers. I want you to secure this and other 
bulletins of the department which I represent. You may secure 
many of them free on application to the Forest Service in Wash- 
ington, and others may be had for a nominal price. I want 
those of you who are in a position to do so to criticise and make 
suggestions for the improvement of: such plans as are offered in 
these publications, and I want you to help us place other mate- 
rials which we have available into the hands of those whom they 
will best serve. Among these materials I wish to mention par- 
ticularly lantern slides and photographs which the Forest Ser- 
vice loans free of charge, except for transportation, to schools, 
libraries and others. Some of the lantern slides are made up 
into lecture sets and have lecture outlines to accompany them, 
and so may be used with a minimum of labor by the teacher who 
-borrows them. I particularly want to see the subject of ele- 
mentary forestry, especially with reference to agriculture, in- 
troduced into the normal schools of the country, so that teachers 
of rural schools may be able to pass on to their pupils some of 
the elements of woodlot management which the boy in the coun- 
try stands so much in need of. 
In an address of this kind I can do no more than throw out 
a few simple suggestions for your consideration. I cannot ex- 
pect that they will all find a response in all of you, with the 
varying needs which your different lines of work present, but I 
shall feel adequately repaid for my efforts if a few progressive 
teachers at this meeting, especially such as have the privilege of 
teaching teachers, will extend me their codperation, will get in 
touch with me by correspondence at the Forest Service in Wash- 
ington, and if a few live centers of interest in agricultural for- 
estry are as a result established in the Southern States.

already away, but still I am sure that those who are left will be 
glad to oblige the photographers.

THE ONTARIO PLAN OF SCHOOL BOOK PUBLICATION. 
DR. D. J. GOGGIN, TORONTO, ONTARIO, CANADA. 
Historical. 
The settlement of Ontario dates from 1784 when the United 
Empire Loyalists came in large numbers to found homes in the 
province. The first “Common School Act” was passed April 1st, 
1816, and under it the first attempt was made by the government 
to regulate the kind of books to be used in the schools. A Com- 
mission of Education in 1839 recommended that some means 
should be taken whereby the school might be provided with text- 
books at a cheap rate from Great Britain, or that a series of 
compilations or re-publications should be prepared and printed 
in the province as the school books to be used in all the schools. 
In 1846 provision was made for the appointment of a Super- 
intendent of Education and for a Board of Education to advise 
the Superintendent upon all measures he might submit. This 
board was to examine and make recommendations respecting all 
books to be used in schools. On October 27th, 1846, the board, 
upon the advice of Dr. Ryerson, the superintendent, recom- 
mended the Irish National Series of school texts for exclusive use 
in the province. The aim was to secure uniformity in texts—if 
possible, not more than one authorized text in a subject—and to 
exclude books anti-British in sentiment. From that time till 
the present our legislation has had in view a uniform single- 
text system of school books. 
An agitation in favor of a Canadian National Series cul- 
minated, twenty years later (1868), in the preparation by Can- 
adian educators of a series, Canadian in sentiment, and manufac-
-P-A-G-E-119

tured in Canada. The copyright was vested in the Superintend- 
ent of Education, and four firms secured the right to publish the 
books. 
Upon retirement of Dr. Ryerson in 1876, a Minister of 
Education was appointed. The first Minister of Education, Mr. 
Crooks, announced in 1881 that the Canadian Series of Readers 
would be replaced by a new series. Three series were submitted 
by rival publishers, and two of these series were authorized 
June 30th, 1888. The struggles of the rival publishers to secure 
adoption and exchange produced such dissatisfaction through- 
out the province that Mr. Ross, who had succeeded Mr. Crooks 
as Minister of Education, gave notice that authorization of the 
two series would be withdrawn as soon as a new series could 
be prepared under the direction of his department. 
This new series—the Ontario Series of Readers—edited 
by a committee of teachers, was authorized November 26th, 
1884. The government paid the cost of editing, typesetting, and 
electrotyping, and arranged for the publication of the series by 
the three firms which had prepared series for approval in 1882. 
They were given the sole right of publication for ten years— 
till November 26th, 1894—and this agreement was renewed for 
a period terminating July 1st, 1906. The cost of all other texts 
was borne by their publishers. 
The leader of the Opposition in the Ontario Legislative 
Assembly, Mr. (now Sir James) Whitney, had frequently as- 
serted in the Assembly and in addresses to the electors that the 
cost of text-books was excessive. In an address delivered at 
the city of Hamilton shortly before he became Premier of On- 
‘ tario, he said: “I say that the prices charged for school books 
are too high. You are at the mercy of a school book ring. We 
will, if returned, give you better school books at lower prices. 
I know that we can get this done by the publishing houses of 
Canada, but if they will not print the books for us, we will print 
them ourselves, and sell them to the people of the province at 
cost.” 
Appointment of a Commission. 
In 1905 the Ross Government was defeated, and Mr. Whit- 
ney became Premier. The new Minister of Education, Dr. 
Pyne, announced in April, 1906:
-P-A-G-E-120
  120 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
“That a commission would be appointed to inquire into, and report upon, 
the reasonableness of the present prices of school text-books now on the 
authorized list, and to inquire also into the prices of such publications else- 
where.” 
This Text-book Commission met July 20th, 1906, and con- 
tinued its investigations at intervals till December 19th, 1906. 
The information secured by this Commission, and its findings 
are given in a “Report of the Text-book Commission, 1907” 
published by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. 
The Commissioners declared that there had been a monop- 
oly in the publication of readers, and that the books were sold 
to the public for more than double their cost. ‘For twenty-two 
years the public school readers have been so published that dur- 
ing that time the public school children of Ontario have been 
required to use inferior readers, and to pay about $200,000 
therefor, more than what, under the circumstances, was a fair 
price.” They recommended: 
“That if a satisfactory and modern set of Readers cannot be secured, 
one should be prepared by the Department, the copyright of all selections 
secured, the plates made, and that the printing be given out by tender, 
under proper specifications, to one firm.” 
“That if the Department finds it necessary to continue the old Readers 
for a short period, until a new set can be secured, tenders be invited for the 
printing, and that the contract be given to not more than two firms, one 
preferably.” 
“That a special officer be appointed for this work (to inspect text-books) 
at a special salary. Only thus can the Department protect itself and the 
public and keep the standard of its books equal to the best elsewhere. 
Such an officer should have a library of his own, to which should be added, 
as they appear, all the leading text-books published in the United States or 
Great Britain. It should be part of his duty to keep in touch with the Depart- 
ment and also with the teachers and inspectors. He will thus discover early 
any defects in the books which are being sent out to the schools.” 
In accordance with the recommendation of the commission 
tenders were asked for the publication of the Ontario Readers 
for the period of a year and a half, that is, until the new series 
of readers which the Government had decided to prepare should 
be ready. The tender of the Canadian Publishing Company was 
accepted, the price for a set of these books being 49 cents as 
compared with $1.15 for the old issue of the same series, this 
reduced price to come into effect June 30th, 1907. For the first 
ten years of issue this series of readers had been retailed at 
$1.30 a set, and now it could be purchased for 49 cents.

  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 121 
Preparation of the New Series of Readers. 
On October 15th, 1907, the Minister of Education announced 
that it had been decided to prepare a new set of readers, that 
he had appointed, as editor, a man familiar with all grades of 
school work and with expert knowledge of printing and bind- 
ing, and that he had selected a committee of representative 
educators chosen from the University, the inspectors of schools, 
the principals of training schools, and the teachers, to assist the 
editor. 
When the task of selecting literature for each book had 
been completed, and when the Educational Council of the prov- 
ince had reported to the Minister of Education on the suitability 
of this literature for the teaching of reading, tenders were in- 
vited for the typesetting and electrotyping of the matter. 
Publication of the Readers. 
When the electrotype plates were ready, the Minister of 
Education advertised, March 20th, 1909, for tenders for publi- 
cation of the Ontario School Readers, as the new set is called, 
for a period of ten years. 
Specifications. 
The specifications defined the size, weight, and quality of 
the paper to be used; the size of the page and widths of margin; 
the quality of the ink and presswork; the quality of the ma- 
terials to be used in the binding and the methods to be em- 
ployed. 
Ten publishing firms tendered at prices ranging from 49 
cents to 95 cents for a series of five readers, 1216 pages. The 
contract was awarded to the lowest tenderer, the T. Eaton Com- 
pany, Limited, and signed April 20th, 1909. 
Cost. 
The cost to the province of the new series of readers was 
$9,481.55. The retail price of a set of the old series of 968 
pages was $1.15; of the new series of 1216 pages, 49 cents. If 
we take the actual sales of the new readers from their publica- 
tion in August, 1909, to the end of that year and compare what 
purchasers paid with what they would have had to pay for an 
equal number of the old series the saving is $70,260. Of course, 
sales at introduction are always larger than at any subsequent 
   
-P-A-G-E-122
122 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
period, but on the number of readers actually sold the next year 
(1910) the relative saving is $35,806 for the year. If we esti- 
mate savings each year thereafter at $25,000—a low estimate— 
there will be a total savings on the readers, during the life of 
the contract, of $300,000. We consider that a satisfactory re- 
turn for an expenditure of less than $10,000 by the Government. 
The contract entered into by the successful tenderer is as 
follows, and, except for necessary changes in the names and 
sizes of their books, their retail prices, and the amount of bonds, 
is substantially that entered into by every publisher who issues 
a school book for the Government of Ontario. The clause (36) 
respecting a free set of electrotypes is omitted when the pub- 
lisher bears the total cost of production of a book.

forthwith at the option of the said Minister be forfeited and void. 
16. Should any difference of opinion arise between the parties hereto as 
to the construction to be put upon any of the terms, conditions, and agree- 
ments herein contained, the same shall be determined by the Attorney-Gen- 
eral of Ontario, after giving the parties hereto an opportunity of presenting 
their views, in person or by counsel, and such determination by the Attorney- 
General shall be final and conclusive and binding upon the parties to this 
indenture. 
17. And the Publisher agrees that if he shall disregard the terms of this 
indenture, or fail to carry out the same to the satisfaction of the Minister, 
he shall, on notice from the Minister, absolutely forfeit all rights under this 
indenture, and will be restrained from further printing, publishing, or selling 
any copies of the book for use in the schools of the Province of Ontario, or 
with any words printed or stamped thereon or therein to the effect that the 
same is authorized by the Minister of Education for Ontario. Provided that 
the Minister shall not so forfeit the rights of the Publisher until he shall 
have continued in such disregard or failure for ten days after notice thereof 
shall have been given to him by the Minister. 
18. The Minister agrees with the Publisher that there shall be no other 
set of Readers, which might be used in substitution for and to the exclusion 
of the “ONTARIO READERS,” authorized for use in the schools of the 
Province of Ontario during the currency of this contract, after second of 
July, 1909, provided always that any authorized Reader in use in any school 
before the midsummer vacation of 1909, and recommended by resolution of 
the Board of Trustees of said school, shall be deemed authorized for said 
school during the pleasure of the Minister. 
19. In case any edition of the book is condemned by the Minister as 
unfit for use in the schools of the Province of Ontario, the condemned edi- 
tion shall be withdrawn from sale, and shall, if required by the Minister, be 
delivered by the Publisher into the custody of the Minister. 
20. It is also understood and agreed between the parties hereto that 
this indenture contains the whole agreement with respect to the publication 
of the said book, and that the same is not and has not been and cannot be 
added to, altered, or varied by any verbal statements or explanations made 
between or by any of the parties hereto, 
In witness whereof the parties hereto have set their respective hands 
and seals the day and year first above written.

Safeguards. 
The methods of ensuring satisfactory manufacture of the 
books may be stated thus: 
“Each publisher submits samples of the materials to be 
used in the publication of an edition. These samples are thor- 
oughly tested in the Department of Education, and, if found 
satisfactory, one is given to the publisher, and another is filed 
in the department, with dates, quality, etc., endorsed thereon. 
Sample sheets of presswork are submitted, and filed if approved. 
When the book is printed and bound, copies are submitted for 
examination, and are compared with materials previously ac- 
cepted. If satisfactory these copies are endorsed, and one copy 
given to the publisher, and the other filed in the department. 
Not until these conditions have been complied with, is the pub- 
lisher at liberty to offer the edition for sale. 
“At such time as the Minister may direct, an official visits 
the publishing houses and examines the books, either in pro- 
cess of manufacture, or on the shelves, to see that the terms of 
the contracts are observed.” 
Other Text-books. 
Later, under the supervision of the General Editor of 
Text-books and at the expense of the Government, arrange- 
ments were made for the preparation of the subject-matter 
and electros of the Public School Arithmetic, the Public School 
English Grammar, the High School English Composition, the 
High School French Reader, and the High School German 
Reader. The publication of these books was awarded by ten- 
der on very favorable terms. All the other texts were pre- 
pared and issued at the expense of their publishers, the sub- 
ject matter, manufacture, and selling price having been ar- 
ranged satisfactorily with the Minister. Copyright is vested 
in the Minister during the period of authorization. 
Changes. 
Under our contracts the publisher, upon receiving six 
months notice, is required to make, at his expense, any changes 
that errors in the text, advances. in science, changes in bound- 
aries of countries or forms of government, etc., may render 
necessary, provided the changes do not increase the cost of 
publication. With the co-operation of publishers and teachers 
we are enabled to keep our texts abreast of the times.

Conclusion. 
The Ontario Government does not publish its school texts. 
It has not found it necessary to do so. It has paid for the edit- 
ing and electrotyping of the readers, and of five other books, 
but the publication of these has been let by public tender to 
publishers at prices satisfactory to the government. All other 
texts, some thirty in number, have been produced by the pub- 
lisher at his cost but under government supervision. Our 
teachers speak favorably of these texts after having tested 
them in the class rooms. Other provinces in the Dominion are 
introducing them. The plan has ceased to be an experiment. 
It suits our conditions and is a success.

THE CHAIR: I am sure I voice the Association in thank- 
ing the Doctor for his visit to us, and I want to say to you that 
since I happen to know myself, but which fact may not be 
known to you, that he will leave tomorrow morning, that any 
of you who want to talk to him further on this interesting 
matter will find him at the Hermitage Hotel this evening. 
Dr. P. P. Claxton has written that owing to the death of 
his son and the illness of his wife he can not be present, and 
he has added, knowing the program well, that you may say to 
the members of the Association that the Department of Educa- 
tion at Washington is interested in this very subject, and will 
have a bulletin printed upon it this winter. 
In place of Dr. Claxton, he has sent the former Superin- 
tendent of Nebraska, not “O’Brien’’, somehow he will have to 
excuse himself for that, but “McBrien”. Mr. J. M. McBrien 
will now address you. 
J. M. McBRIEN: In some of the states represented in this 
Association I have found from a recent trip through the South 
that there are certain local school districts, although they have 
the legal right and the financial ability to vote a local school 
tax upon themselves for a good rural school, have thus far 
failed to do so, but lean too heavily upon the county and state 
tax for financial support, holding only the length of school 
term which the limited county and state tax will provide for 
them. Either the county and state should provide sufficient 
funds for a longer term of school, for better school equipment 
and repairs, for better salaries for better teachers, or else the 
local patriotism of the people should be so aroused that they 
are willing to vote the necessary local tax upon themselves for 
these better rural schools. Let them help themselves so far as
-P-A-G-E-131
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 131 
possible, for it is still true that God helps them who help them- 
selves. 
To overcome the many obstacles to educational progress 
under the present rural school system in a majority of the 
states North as well as South, East as well as West, and for 
the purpose of giving every farmer boy and every farmer girl 
in this great nation of ours equal opportunities to those so long 
enjoyed by boys and girls in the town and city schools let edu- 
cational leaders everywhere unite in urging upon the patrons 
in these rural schools and upon administrative school officers 
thereof to make a careful study of the multiplied advantages 
of the consolidated rural school over the old time weak rural 
school, which in so many places has outlived its usefulness. 
Consolidate or centralize the weak rural school districts into 
a strong central school, conveying the pupils from every part 
of the greater district to and from school by means of covered 
vans or wagons in charge of clean, capable, careful drivers. 
The merits of the plan may be briefly stated as follows: (1) 
The pupils enjoy the advantages of that interest and enthusi- 
asm and confidence which numbers always bring; (2) pupils 
can be better classified and graded; (3) tardiness and irregu- 
lar attendance are reduced to the minimum; (4) no quarreling, 
improper conduct, or improper language so common among 
children on their way to and from school; (5) No wet feet or wet 
clothing nor colds resulting therefrom; (6) pupils have the ad- 
vantage of better school rooms, better lighted, better heated, 
better ventilated; (7) this plan is sure to result in better 
teachers who will be better paid. 
Train Toward the Farm. 
In our campaign for better rural schools we must make the 
education given therein better adapted to the environment 
wants and needs of farmer boys and farmer girls, than we 
have done thus far. We may not all be political followers of 
the preacher whose educational gospel I now restate but I be- 
lieve that we will all admit that it is good pedagogy for the 
rural schools: ‘Let us hope that more and more our people 
will see to it that our schools train toward and not from the 
farm and the workshop. We have spoken a great deal about 
the dignity of labor in this country, but we have not acted up 
to our spoken words, for in our education we have tended to
-P-A-G-E-132
132 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
proceed upon the assumption that the educated man was to be 
educated away from and not toward labor. Let us show that 
we regard the position of the man who works with his hands 
as being ordinarily and in good faith as important and digni- 
fied and as worthy of consideration as that of business man or 
professional man.” I would not have you preach an impossible 
ideal; for if you preach an ideal that is impossible, you tend 
to make your pupils believe that no ideals are possible, and 
therefore you tend to do them the worst of wrongs—to teach 
them to divorce preaching from practice, and divorce the ideal 
that they in the abstract admire from the practical good after 
which they strive. Teach the boy and girl that their business 
is to earn their own livelihood. Teach the boy that he is to be 
the home-maker; the girl that she must ultimately be the home- 
keeper; that the work of the father is to be the bread-winner, 
and that of the mother the housekeeper; that their work is the 
most important work by far in all the land; that the work of the 
statesman, the writer, the captain of industry and all the rest is 
conditioned first upon the work that finds its expression in the 
family that supports the family. So teach the boy that he is ex- 
pected to earn his own livelihood; that it is a shame and a scan- 
dal for him not to be self-dependent, not to be able to hold his 
own in the rough, hard work of actual life; teach the girl that so 
far from its being her duty to try to avoid all labor, all effort, it 
should be a matter of pride to her to be as good a housewife as 
her mother was before her. 
If our farmer girls and farmer boys are to live as the men 
and women of tomorrow in sight of this plain, homely, practical 
yet happy ideal, we must provide for them industrial rural 
schools wherein they may be trained for such work. By indus- 
trial schools I mean those schools which will teach the boys 
scientific agriculture and manual training that will fit them for 
twentieth century farmers; that will give the girls skill and 
training as housekeepers and housewives. 
Let us teach our farmer boys and farmer girls just as we 
would teach our town boys and town girls, that integrity and 
industry are the most valuable possessions that can come to 
young men and young women in this life; that integrity and in- 
dustry are so valuable that money will not buy them; that the 
cunning of the thief cannot steal them; that there is no way to 
secure them by mortgage; that on bended knee they cannot
-P-A-G-E-133
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 133 
beg them, but that by honest effort and right living they can 
make them a veritable part of themselves; that integrity and 
industry still build happy homes; that every avenue of life is 
open to them; that capital waits upon them; that citizenship is 
not good without them; that they are as dear as life itself, and 
therefore to lay fast hold upon them—let them not go—but keep 
them. 
THE CHAIR: It seems best, I take the responsibility on 
myself, that we transfer a speaker who was to have come to- 
morrow, and who represents the old State of Virginia about 
which we have just been speaking, to this good time, and I shall 
ask State Superintendent Stearnes, of Richmond, Va., to now 
address you for fifteen or twenty minutes, after which we will 
conclude. 
‘EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND THEIR ORGANIZA- 
TION. 
R. C. STEARNES, RICHMOND, VA. 
Though proudly and deeply guilty myself when it comes to 
the two charges of organizing and attending educational con- 
ferences, I am convinced nevertheless that we have too many 
meetings at the present time and that they are all too much 
alike. 
To maintain interest our meetings of greatest scope and 
constituency use three well known program types. They ap- 
point committees which are willing to undertake to tell school 
men exactly how to do anything from paper cutting to the ar- 
rangement of a high school course of study; they secure the 
orator of national or international reputation and the audiences 
lose themselves for sixty or ninety minutes in the spells which 
he weaves around them; and, finally, they honor achievement, 
which is highly proper, by giving us the privilege of listening 
to the modest statement by the doer himself of what he, the 
chief actor, has done in the striking dramas of achievement 
which come into public notice. 
I am not finding fault with any of these features of good 
programs. The first, to be sure, might very profitably be left 
for the exclusive use of the National Educational Association, 
with a suggestion even to that body that, after all, great text- 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  134 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
writers will maintain their supremacy in the field of method 
and procedure notwithstanding the report of many commit- 
tees. As to the timid and modest statement of some teachers 
who have been discovered doing new and startling things, it is 
comforting to know that for every successful school worker 
who is placed on our list of speakers there are at least one hun- 
dred who do equally well and are happy though they receive 
not the applause of listening thousands. If the disposition of 
ours to bow down before the man who has done something also 
offers too great a temptation to the speaker occasionally, per- 
haps the recording angel remembers that visions and fertile 
imaginations are quite essential to progress and are, indeed, 
so human. 
Programs of the conventional type are very well in their 
way, but there is another field of richer meaning to which our 
Southern ‘Association should devote themselves, as a major 
line of effort. 
First of all, however, these associations should get to- 
gether. From both sides I have heard the wish that our South- 
ern Educational Association and the Conference for Education 
in the South should be merged. Can anyone who thinks over 
the matter dispassionately and views things from a practical 
standpoint doubt the wisdom of the suggestion? 
Take the case of a Southern State superintendent. Be- 
sides his own state conference, he must attend the meetings of 
the National Educational Association, two of the Conferences 
for Education in the South, and one of this body. All of these 
meetings are immensely helpful and the state superintendent 
does not do his full duty to his commonwealth if he neglects 
them, but in these days of opportunity the state superintendent 
has other work to do and his people will protest if he spends 
twenty to thirty days annually in attendance upon conven- 
tions beyond the borders of his state. 
The evil is accentuated when we remember that other state 
Officials, representatives of state institutions and representa- 
tives of local school boards, attend these meetings at public 
expense. We are obliged to be careful and consider public opin- 
ion since it belongs not to education in our land to encourage 
junketing. 
The best evidence one may gather of the fact that we are 
moving too far or too illogically into the convention realm is
-P-A-G-E-135
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 135 
found in the flamboyant advertisements of “what is assured.” 
The officers who send out the preliminary notices of some of 
our modern conventions or congresses present a sad contrast 
to the conscientious, courageous and consistent secretry of this 
association. The bargain store might take lessons from them. 
The advertisement of one I attended not so many years ago 
stated that more than a thousand delegates were “assured.” 
“Come early,” the reverend secretary said, “or you won’t get 
in.” Now, that body had general sessions, councils, subordinate 
conferences and departments, and called upon agriculture, music, 
art, hygiene, libraries, kindergartens, reformatories, prisons, 
suffrage, factories, social settlements, etc., for side attractions. 
Yet I heard a great Methodist bishop beg a congregation on 
Sunday to come out and exhibit an audience for the remaining 
half of the meeting. This bishop was a.presiding officer at the 
conference in question, and he said he was tired of introducing 
some of the most distinguished speakers in America to audi- 
ences of twenty-five or fifty people,—shifting audiences because 
some of the earlier speakers neglected the doctrine that turn 
about is fair play and would not stay to hear those who had 
patiently listened to them; inattentive audiences in some sense 
because many of the later speakers were too full of their own 
speeches to be able to listen with full receptivity to all that went 
before. 
We have too many meetings. Our associational work should 
be better coérdinated and materially modified. 
I join in the suggestion that the Southern Educational As- 
sociation and the Conference for Education in the South be 
merged into one organization. The time seems peculiarly op- 
portune. 
Some effort should be made to correlate this new organiza- 
tion with the National Educational Association, which is itself 
probably facing reorganization. There is an enormous amount 
of change in the personnel of the corps of leading school offi- 
cials in the South, a fact commented on several times during 
this convention. There might be some form of connection with 
the National Educational Association to keep many of our lead- 
ing educators in that body long enough to be known and recog- 
nized. Then, indeed, we might take our rightful place in that 
great organization. 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  136 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
There can be no really great annual gatherings of long life 
and prolific usefulness without the two features harvest-home 
and representative control. I say, therefore, that our great 
Southern Association must realize itself in comparing the handi- 
work of our best workers and must be governed by duly elected, 
fully accredited, and comfortably financed delegates of those 
workers. Then you will see life and vim and snap and rivalry 
—you who are descendants of a race in whom the tournament 
was as breath to the nostrils—and competition in pure bred 
stock, fruits, grains, and babies coérdinate with the love of fair 
women. 
We have our great state associations where we secure an 
attendance of from two to three thousand persons. We have 
our county associations and school fairs where the attendance 
is sometimes almost as great. The county associations elect 
delegates to the state association and in addition send thither 
all school fair exhibits earning a first or second prize, as well as 
the choicest specimens of canning-club and demonstration work. 
The delegates go to these meetings with a sense of responsi- 
bility that is charming and with them go many teachers, pupils, 
and patrons. The plan makes the local people feel that the state 
association is their association. They feel that they control it 
and that the work of their children’s hands adorns it. The scene 
is uniformly an inspiring one. The right elements are there,— 
the bringing together of first fruits, community of interest and 
fellowship in a forum where budding genius may be discovered 
and encouraged. 
Why not extend the same principles to any section of the 
Union where may be found oneness of problem and congeniality 
of spirit? Truly, there is a field for a Southern Educational 
Association which is neither sectional nor provincial and which 
functions in great achievements that may be laid on the altar 
of the nation to receive the plaudits of all good Americans from 
Maine to California. There is also a place for a New England 
Association, a Northwestern Association, and regional (not sec- 
tional) associations of other names and boundaries. 
The responsibility for the success of the one great annual 
gathering of Southern teachers should be placed on the state 
organizations of whatever name or relation. The state organiza- 
tions should be invited to send duly accredited delegates, not ’ess
-P-A-G-E-137
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS A 137 
than a dozen each, representing as nearly as may be the depart- 
mental activities of this association. The government of the 
great regional association, if one may borrow a term from cur- 
rent financial history, should be in the hands of these delegates, 
and reports or tangible evidences of progress in the various 
states should be features of the meeting. One may easily imag- 
ine the round-table discussions which would follow naturally if 
time were given to consider the reports and point out the sig- 
nificance of the exhibits. Rivalry both definite and generous 
ought to develop, which would mean much in the way of prog- 
ress, and the spontaneity of delegates newly clothed with respon- 
sibility is no less interesting than their readiness to carry words 
into actions which is the main point when strong men and brave 
women have such an opportunity as now presents itself to 
Southern educators. 
There might be other governing or directing bodies in this 
greater association that I am permitted to visualize in my mind’s 
eye, but the body of the delegates herein advocated should be its 
House of Commons and should function accordingly. 
Mr. President, these thoughts are submitted with diffidence 
and certainly without any hope or idea of revolutionizing things. 
They may serve to show the point of view of the man “in the 
outlying districts” if nothing more,—the man who desires to see 
his state well represented in the meetings of this honorable 
body. Your sessions will be held near the center of the South 
as a rule and both distance and expense are serious matters to 
teachers who come from border states like Virginia. Some plan 
must be devised to aid in paying the expenses of those who are 
expected to represent their distant states. This will put the 
border states on a plane or equality with those in the interior. 
Finally, it is safe to predict that each delegate will mean 
five or ten persons in actual attendance. It takes numbers to 
start a movement just as a flood of water is required to start a 
current. The annual pilgrimage of ten or twenty delegates from 
each Southern State to this our great feast both of trumpets and 
of ingathering will attract attention and excite comment. Oth- 
ers will desire to accompany those regularly appointed to go 
and in this day of conventions nothing more is needed. 
THE CHAIR: I think you see why I wished him to speak to- 
night, in order that you might think over it before the business 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  138 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
session tomorrow. The session will meet again at 9:30 in this 
room. 
Pror. W. K. TATE: Before we go I think it is only fitting 
that this Association should send to Dr. Claxton its greeting and 
sympathy. Dr. Claxton is a former President of the Southern 
Educational Association, has worked with it in every capacity, 
he is one of our own Tennesseans, and one of our own South- 
erners, and Mrs. Claxton is from Nashville,-and I move, sir, that 
the President of this Association be requested to send the tele- 
gram which I shall read, or some other which he shall compose, 
to Dr. Claxton: “The Southern Educational Association misses 
your presence, and extends to you and Mrs. Claxton its affec- 
tionate sympathy in your bereavement.” 
THE CHAIR: Do you make that as a motion? 
Pror. W. K. TATE: I make that as a motion. 
Seconded, carried, and so ordered. 
Session dismissed. 
SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1918, 9:30 A. M. 
Session called to order by the Chair. 
THE CHAIR: Let me ask the speakers to please not go over 
the time limit, because we want to have as much opportunity 
as possible for discussion of some important matters that come 
up at the close of the morning session. 
I am sure you will have pleasure in listening to a gentle- 
man whose work has been exceedingly good and efficient in every 
way in Kentucky. We will now hear from Mr. T. J. Coates, who 
has supervision of the rural schools. 
Pror. T. J. CoATES: Ladies and Gentlemen:—The topic 
assigned to me to talk briefly upon this morning is the question 
of supervising rural schools, and inasmuch as the supervision 
of rural schools in the sense in which we now speak of it is a 
new thing, it seems to me very important that we get as correct 
ideas as we may about a movement that is new, and may be 
fraught with a good deal of good for our rural schools. With 
your permission, I am going to say a few very definite things
-P-A-G-E-139
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 139 
about it, and will try not to exceed my time, but rather to con- 
sume less. 
It is only in recent years that man have realized that such 
a thing as a rural problem exists. I shall not discuss the evi- 
dence of the existence of a rural problem, but shall content my- 
self with saying that the solution of this problem involves the 
building of a community life that will be satisfactory to the 
rural people, a life that will be able to maintain itself against 
the competition and the call of the city. The rural school prob- 
lem, in its final analysis, resolves itself into a rural life prob- 
lem. Any solution of the rural school problem that does not 
take into consideration the whole community problem in the 
country will be temporary and disappointing. In other words, 
it won’t stay put. The rural school can not be permanently im- 
proved faster than the community life that supports it. To 
originate and carry out plans for permanently bettering the 
life of a people demands trained and efficient leadership. The 
supervisor of rural schools must become that leader. Just stop 
and let that soak in. Many of us have seen schools that were 
very much improved this year, but next year fall back. They 
do not stay improved. Dr. Cupperly recently declared that the 
rural school of today is relatively further behind the city school 
in preparing its pupils for life than it was twenty years ago. 
A considerable experience in the actual teaching of rural schools 
in my younger manhood, and my opportunity for observing 
rural schools in the last few years, convinces me that he is cor- 
rect. 
He offers three remedies as indispensable to the permanent 
improvement of the rural school—I want you to notice that I 
use the word “permanent,” I am not interested in a remedy 
that is only pallitative—these three remedies are better salaries 
for teachers, consolidation of schools, and efficient supervision. 
It seems to me, friends, that we might as well face the truth 
and be done with it,—that our discussions with country people, 
with country leadership, that we might as well meet at once and 
be done with it, these facts. 
The efficient supervision of country schools can be brought 
about only through trained supervision of rural schools. There 
are two kinds of supervision—supervision through the methods 
of the taskmaster, harsh, unsympathetic and critical, and the
-P-A-G-E-140
  140 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
supervision of the sympathetic leader through methods of in- 
spiration and constructive force. In the city few people own 
their own jobs, and therefore people who work grow familiar 
with the boss. In the country, most people own their own jobs, 
and are not familiar with the ways of the boss. City teachers 
may bear with the supervisor who assumes the attitude of an 
overseer or taskmaster. But country teachers grow restless 
and unhappy under such conditions. Therefore the supervisor 
of rural schools must not assume, and I deem this very import- 
ant, the supervisor of rural schools must not assume the attitude 
of critic or fault finder. Nothing will lead more quickly to dis- 
crediting the whole thing than for the supervisor in a country 
district to assume any such role as that. City folks will stand 
it—country folks won’t. That has been my experience. But 
he must assume the role of an inspirational and helpful leader. 
The rural teacher is much like the farmer,—he welcomes the 
demonstrator, but never will stand a critic or boss, and the 
farmer’s daughter and son are very much like the old man. 
Believing these things, the Kentucky Educational Associa- 
tion in 1912 asked the Legislature of 1912 to pass a law per- 
mitting County Boards of Education to employ supervisors to 
assist the county superintendent in supervising his schools. 
The law was passed and went into effect June 12, 1912. Since 
that time the county boards in sixty counties have employed 
ninety-four supervisors, paying them salaries from $60.00 to 
$100.00 a month out of county funds. I shall remark here, by 
way of parenthesis, that I know no way, and I have asked hun- 
dreds of teachers and people for a way, to make a school taught 
by an inexperienced and inefficient boy or girl a good school 
without having somebody to come in and talk with him and help 
him, and guide him over some of the difficulties. 
What have the supervisors been doing? Many things. Here 
are a few things. Now, remember, ladies and gentlemen, that 
these supervisors are feeling their way. It is a new thing, a 
new environment, a new problem, and that mistakes may actu- 
ally continue to be made is recognized by all of us. 
The supervisors of Lawrence County have doubled the at- 
tendance in the schools of that county. In 1911 the attendance 
was 33%. In 1913, with two school supervisors, it was 64%. I 
saw a supervisor, as a truant officer, report man, and after- 
wards I saw those men on the rock-pile for absolutely and wil-
-P-A-G-E-141

fully refusing to obey the laws of the state and educate their 
children, who had never darkened a schoolhouse door. 
Supervisor A. B. Thomas, of Knott County, has organized 
the teachers into clubs to study their work in that far-away 
hill county. Six nights in the week for three months he has as- 
sembled the people in their little school house and told them of 
the larger life in store for them. He organized a company of 
thirty men and women and rode sixty miles on horseback and 
in jolty wagons to attend a teachers’ meeting. 
Superintendent O’Rear of Montgomery County says he is 
getting the teachers together so that the older ones can help 
the younger ones. 
Supervisor McClure organized the boys and girls into Corn 
Clubs and Tomato Clubs, and good roads clubs, and raised over 
$500.00 in money for this purpose. 
Supervisor Mrs. Munson, of Harrison County, has organ- 
ized the schools of her county, and relieves the teachers of much 
of the burden of classification. In our country schools the aver- 
age teacher finds a great deal of trouble in classifying. Mrs. 
Jones wants her daughter to go with Mrs. Brown’s daughter 
in the sixth grade, when probably she should be in the fourth, 
though she may be eighteen or nineteen or twenty years old, 
and the teacher will not stand for that which she knows is 
right, but weakly yields, as probably we should do, to the will 
of the parents. The supervisor is attending these schools and 
classifying these children, and then when the supervisor is gone 
and the child has been put back where she belongs, the teacher 
says, “I didn’t do it. The supervisor did it.” 
Superintendent Stewart, of Rowen County, has two: super- 
visors at work, and there are only seven illiterates left in that 
little mountain county. . 
Supervisor Hughes, of Knox County, has led his county in 
sanitary work— 
DELEGATE: Mr. Coates, may I ask you a question right 
there? Three years ago what was the percentage of illiteracy? 
Mr. CoaTES: Oh, I suppose two or three thousand in the 
county, may be 25%. It illustrates what can be done when a 
trained leader takes in hand a definite problem of doing a defi- 
nite thing. That work could never have been done without 
those able supervisors.

I just want to mention one thing of one man. Superin- 
tetndent E. R. Jones, of Franklin County, has divided his county 
into four supervising districts, and the supervisors are training 
the teachers, and I want to say that one of these supervisors is 
the brother of the state superintendent, and it is inspiring to 
see that young man, a graduate of one of the best colleges in 
Virginia, with his leggins on, walking about that district. You 
know, ladies and gentlemen, in the city whatever one woman 
does in her front yard, another woman does, but in the country 
there is no such a thing to inspire the people. 
Most of these supervisors are normal trained men and 
women, and through them the normal schools are leavening the 
lump. Some supervisors are giving their teachers lessons in 
the branches, others in methods of teaching. I find some super- 
visors going from district to district, and absolutely teaching 
the teachers, directing their way, and directing the study of 
young men and young women who are too poor to go to normal 
schools, and these men are doing that for them. Every super- 
visor is doing many things. 
They report their activities to the county superintendent, 
and usually send the state office a copy, and in the state office 
we put together into a composite the best things in all their 
reports, and send it back to every supervisor. In other words, 
we are undertaking to have Kentucky do team work, so that the 
work of each superintendent and each supervisor will be an in- 
spiration and direction to everybody else working under the 
same conditions. By keeping everybody posted about what all 
are doing, we are developing a spirit of emulation among the 
supervisors. 
This is one of the most important things that I see in our 
development. By keeping each supervisor and each superin- 
tendent posted as to what every other one is doing, it has a 
tendency to inspire these men to do something themselves. 
Isolation, ladies and gentlemen, is the curse of country life 
in school matters, as well as other things. 
What are the tendencies? There are two in our state. The 
tendency is for the county superintendent to become more and 
more the business, the financial head of the schools, and for the 
supervisor to become the leader—the professional leader of the 
people.

THE CHAIR: We will now hear from Miss Mabel Wil- 
liams, President of the Tennessee School Teachers’ Associa- 
tion. 
Miss MABEL WILLIAMS: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gen- 
tlemen:—I am supposed to discuss Mr. Coates’ paper. I did 
not know, of course, what he was going to say until just now, 
and I am not enough of an impromptu speaker to answer his 
arguments, and to follow them up, but it is really remarkable 
how closely the things I have prepared follow Mr. Coates in 
this matter. 
For instance, I have divided the work of supervision, as 
it has,come to me in my county, under the following heads: 
Securing Necessary Appropriation for School Work; A Definite 
Plan of Consolidation and Transportation to the Central School; 
Building Better School Houses; Raising the Standard of Teach- 
ers and raising their salaries, and, last, when I heard Mr. 
Coates mention this fact I added to it, Securing Special Super- 
visors, and last I added to it Teachers’ Meetings. I am just go- 
ing to take up these topics very briefly, and then I am going to 
show you some pictures of what we have done in the rural 
school work in Shelby County. 
As to the first point, securing necessary appropriations, we 
have the county unit system of school government in my county, 
and one method of taxation, i. e. the County Court levies a 
school tax sufficient to run all the schools in the county, and the 
school board and the county superintendent disburse this fund 
as they see fit. They are not hampered by anything else. Now 
I do think that is the most important thing of all. You cannot 
run schools without money. All the fine enthusiasm and high 
ideals will not run schools unless you have some money to do it 
with, but we have made the schools in Shelby County such a vital 
interest in each community that it is not hard to secure the neces- 
sary funds. When we go before the legislative body it levies these 
taxes. No political leader in Shelby County would dare oppose 
anything for the schools. It would mean his own death-knell, 
because the people are more interested in their schools thany 
any other special feature of the community. This is watched 
constantly. Whenever the tax rate committee meets I meet 
with them, showing them my budget of expenses for the past 
year, where we spent the money, showing them what we need
-P-A-G-E-144
    144 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
for the next year, and giving them all the necessary informa- 
tion that they want, and convincing them that we do need 
what we are asking for, and we have never failed to get it. 
A definite plan of consolidation and transportation to the 
central school. We have done about all that can be done in the 
way of consolidation and transportation in Shelby County. 
That means all that is necessary to be done. Shelby County is 
about 625 miles—has an area of about 625 square miles. We 
have fifty white schools in that section—in that county. The 
number has been reduced in the last four or five years from 
sixty to fifty, and by consolidation we frequently mean taking 
a part of the pupils from a school, the higher grade pupils, and 
transporting them to a central school, and leaving the first 
three grades. Many of these fifty schools, where there is but 
one teacher, only the first three or four grades are taught. We 
do not think any teacher can do satisfactory work with more 
grades than that. We have thirty wagons running in Shelby 
County now, and I will show you pictures of some of the cen- 
tralized schools that we have built in the last five years, and 
more especially some that we have built in the last two years. 
It has been five years since any teacher was employed in 
Shelby County who did not have the equivalent of a high school 
education. We are fortunate in that respect. Our salaries are 
probably a little larger than most counties, and we have appli- 
cations from experienced teachers. We do not have to employ 
those others. In my county this year the election of teachers 
took place the first Monday in June. We filled our places with 
the best applicants we had from experienced teachers from all 
over the South, you might say, but especially from Tennessee. 
We did not employ a single teacher who had not had ex- 
perience until nearly the first of September, when some neces- 
sary vacancies occurred. We just said to those applying, you 
know we have a normal school right there in our own county, 
and we had many applicants from this normal school—we said 
to those girls, our home girls, our first duty is to our schools, 
as you understand, of course, and they always knew that we 
would, as a school board, secure the best teachers who pre- 
sented themselves to us. “We are looking, first, for experi- 
enced, successful teachers. After we have secured all of these
-P-A-G-E-145
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 145 
that we can, we will then give you a chance, if there are any 
vacancies.” We have about twenty-five teachers in my county 
holding diplomas from the best colleges in this country,—Van- 
derbilt, Washington and Lee, Randolph-Macon, Vassar, Well- 
esly, and other schools of that class, to say nothing of the 
smaller colleges and other such institutions which we are not 
counting in this list. We have many Peabody graduates teaching 
in our county. So you can see that our standard of 
teachers is very high, and we are making it higher every year. 
There will come a time within the next year or two when we 
will not take anybody into our schools who is not a graduate of 
a normal school. 
We have raised the salaries of teachers in my county from 
an average of about $45.00 to probably an average of $55.00 
or $60—$55 would be better. We pay our good grade teachers 
this year $60 a month, and good primary teachers $70, and our 
high school teachers range from $70 to $150 a month. 
The teachers’ meetings are another important factor. The 
teachers meeting of Shelby County is convening this morning 
at exactly this hour and this is the first time since I have been 
Superintendent of Education, five years, that I have ever missed 
a meeting. We have many more at our teachers’ meetings than 
are present at this meeting this morning. There are 160 to 175 
teachers always there. I have a full room. Some of these 
teachers drive five miles to the railroad and catch a train at 
6:30 or 10 minutes of 7 o’clock, and come fifteen miles to Mem- 
phis. Some of them drive. In the winter mornings you know 
how early we have to start. But they never miss that teachers’ 
meeting. Now this is a rather peculiar thing. By virtue of 
their position in Shelby County they become a member of the 
Shelby County Teachers’ Association, and it is against all pro- 
fessional ethics—she is just out of things—if she does not come 
to the teachers’ meeting, because it is through the teachers’ 
meeting that we supervise our schools to a certain extent. We 
have all the teachers together, and work can be planned to be 
carried out. Until this year we have had a very fine primary 
teacher who came to talk to my primary teachers every month, 
outlined a plan of work for them, and this was a great help to 
them. The teachers would frequently go to her at other times 
to get help and suggestions from her. 
10
-P-A-G-E-146
  146 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
Another means that I used before we employed a special 
supervisor of primary work was to have the teachers who were 
not as good as some others go and spend a day in the school of 
a good teacher. Now that is a very good thing for any teacher 
to do in any grade. If I know of some school that is especially 
well conducted, I say to this teacher, “I want you to leave 
somebody in charge of your work, or dismiss your school if 
necessary, and go over here to this school and spend the day. 
You will get much more inspiration than your children will 
lose from their work.” I have found that that plan works 
splendidly. 
Now the last thing that we have taken up is the securing 
of supervisors for special branches of work, especially trained 
for that work. That was done this past year. We have added 
a supervisor of primary work to our staff, a supervisor of 
agricultural work in Shelby County, and for two years we have 
had a supervisor of industrial work in the negro schools. The 
supervisor of primary work has already laid out a special—I 
say a special course of study, it is simplified so as to be of great 
help to the teachers who are not so experienced, tells just ex- 
actly what to do and how to teach certain subjects, as well as 
can be. 
We do not spend any money for land in the country, though 
we can buy land,—but we do not do it. It is all donated. The 
people in one community raised $275.00 to put an electric light- 
ing plant in the school, and we used it for the social life of the 
community. We have a kind of lyceum course there perhaps 
once or twice a month. We have a very live principal there 
who looks after this matter. We run about four wagons to this 
school. It is equipped with steam heating plant, its own deep 
well, its own pump and water connectons, just as any school in 
the city is equipped. 
Here is another school, a smaller place. The old wooden 
building, a very dirty, unsanitary place, was replaced with this 
beautiful new building. This is another rural school. This 
shows our beautiful court house in Shelby County where I have 
my offices, and where our teachers are meeting this morning. 
This is a picture of the auto that I used to use in visiting the 
schools, but the school board bought me a new one just the day 
before I came up here.
-P-A-G-E-147
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 147 
This picture shows one of our school buildings, and you 
see by these activities that we are introducing some of the 
newer features. Here is a class in sewing. 
We have a Shelby Athletic Association which takes match 
games, and we have for some years in the past had field day, 
where the schools all meet together for one big day, with prizes, 
and do all sorts of things in which they are very much inter- 
ested, but finally they got so very enthusiastic that we had to 
do away with field day, because teachers, pupils and all came 
to consider it of more importance to take a day off and play a 
match game with another school, to see which was the baseball 
champion of the county, than they did to learn their lessons. 
THE CHAIR: I beg the pardon of the Association for hav- 
- ing to cut off the lady, but we have given her ten mintues over 
the time, and I feel sure with the important business coming 
up that you wish me to push forward on the program. 
Next we will hear from Dr. D. B. Johnson, President of 
Winthrop Normal and Industrial College, Rock Hill, S. C., 
who is known to you all, I am sure. 
THE EFFICIENT COUNTRY SCHOOL. 
DR. D. B. JOHNSON. 
The efficient country school is the most vital educational 
need today not only of the South but of this whole country of 
ours. The whole rural problem which is probably our most 
vital problem is “practically the problem of the country school.” 
The farms are being abandoned by the owners, and agri- 
cultural progress and production are failing to keep pace with 
growth in population and with progress in other directions 
mainly because the country school has failed and is failing to 
relate its work to the life of rural community. 
The startling exodus from the rural districts to the cities 
all over the country is generally attributed to the lack of proper 
educational and social conditions in the country which the 
properly organized and conducted country school might have 
supplied. 
From social and economic surveys it has been found that 
in Illinois about 95 per cent. of the land owners who move to 
town do so because of the inadequacy of the country schools;
-P-A-G-E-148
148 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
that in an area covering 1,764 square miles of the best farm 
lands in Illinois 53 per cent. of the farmers are tenants and 
that in many parts of Missouri more than half of the farmers 
are renters. The agricultural conditions in these two states 
are typical of those in other states. 
The evils of farm tenantry are impressively brought out 
in a recent book by Jack London. He calls the average tenant 
a “land-hog” who takes everything possible out of the land and 
puts nothing back into it. He gives instances of where ten- 
ants had “skinned” enough out of rented land in California in 
three years to buy land for themselves. He recalls the story of 
an old farmer who told a professor at an agricultural experi- 
ment station: “They ain’t no sense in trying to teach me 
farmin’. I know all about it. Ain’t I worked out three farms?” 
and adds that it was his kind that destroyed New England. 
“Back there, great sections are relapsing to wilderness.” 
According to the census of 1910, 45.6% of the land in this 
country available for agriculture is not cultivated either by 
owners or tenants. 
Prof. J. L. Coulter, of the George Peabody College for 
Teachers, has ascertained from the census of 1910 that during 
the ten years from 1899 to 1909 agricultural production in the 
United States increased only ten per cent. over that of the pre- 
ceding decade, while the population—the number of mouths to 
be fed—increased twenty-one per cent. 
Eggleston and Bruére, in an admirable book on the Work 
of the Rural School, just published, holds that it is “the menace 
of hunger that is turning the nation to the rural school as the 
only instrument capable of averting widespread disaster.” 
Confronted by the danger of a shortage in the production 
of the raw materials used for feed, forage, and clothing, “the 
nation is turning to the rural school because, owing to the 
changes wrought by the last century in our economic and social 
life and more especially in the economic and social conditions 
surrounding agricultural production, the rural school more 
than any other one instrument today controls the food supply 
of the nation.” 
Although the prosperity of every other calling, of the coun- 
try itself, depends mainly upon the prosperity of the farmer, 
the wealth producer of the country, his interests have been
-P-A-G-E-149
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 149 
overlooked in legislation and in the organization of courses of 
study, schools, and educational institutions until comparatively 
recent years. Now the leaders of thought and action are real- 
izing the importance of the farmer to the state, and that the 
welfare of the whole country, urban and rural, is involved in 
the welfare of the agricultural people. There is now common 
agreement with Gifford Pinchot in the opinion that “No nation 
can continue to prosper unless its civilization is built upon the 
abiding foundation of a strong and satisfied life in the open 
country.” 
Dr. James W. Robertson, of Canada, who has done such a 
great work in that country for agricultural education, and thus 
for the prosperity of the country, said in an address before a 
conference for education in the South: “Agricultural educa- 
tion is not a trivial matter. It is fundamental to the mainten- 
ance of wholesome civilization that the rural population, the 
workers of the land, should be intelligent about their business 
as well as conscientious in their duties of citizenship.” 
The efficient country school which is to improve agricul- 
tural conditions and to keep good citizens on the farms and 
make good citizens on the farms must relate its work to the 
community life of the people served by it, must educate the 
children for country life instead of away from it; must teach, 
therefore, agriculture and must relate universal elements of 
education to country community needs, must train them for 
their future work in the home, on the farm and in the social 
life around them, must be a “community center of education, 
instructing both children and adults in terms of country life 
and pointing the way to community prosperity and welfare,” 
must concern itself with the business and social life of the 
people, promoting helpful and profitable codperation and neigh- 
borliness. Some one has called the lack of sociability in the 
country, the tendency of the countrymen to live to himself, 
country “individualism,” “the tuberculosis of American farm 
life.” The efficient country school cannot neglect the health, 
the recreation nor the social ideals of the people. 
Mr. Frederick T. Gates, of the General Education Board, 
in a publication of that board under the title “The Country 
School of Tomorrow,” places attention to health of the pupils 
and sanitation of the homes first among the duties of the coun- 
try school of tomorrow. He sums up the work of the efficient 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  150 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
country school to be to make rural life, just where it is, health- 
ful, intelligent, efficient, to fill it with thought and purpose and 
with a gracious social culture not without its joys. 
The mortality rate is now greater in the country than in 
the cities because of the lack of knowledge of the rules of 
health. The countryman expects to be sick, whereas the resi- 
dent of the city expects to be well. 
The efficient country school must be housed in a properly 
constructed school building, with good light and ventilation 
and school furniture and equipment and sanitary closets. The 
grounds should be ample and properly laid off for all kinds of 
recreation. There should be gardens in connection with the 
school to be worked by the pupils, and the school should en- ~ 
courage the pupils to work small gardens at their homes and 
should supervise them. We are now trying as an experiment 
in our state small demonstration farms in connection with a 
limited number of country schools in each county. 
The efficient country school must interest its pupils and 
their parents in the Boys’ Corn Clubs and the Girls’ Canning 
and Poultry Clubs. 
The redirected course of study needed for the efficient 
country school must be determined by the needs of the social 
and economic life of the community as determined by a social 
and economic survey of the community. You cannot “hitch 
up education to life” without knowing what the life is—the 
prevailing aspirations of the community, “its economic and 
social resources and possibilities, its deficiencies and needs.” 
It is not to be understood that it is proposed to discard the 
fundamental studies; it is proposed to relate these studies more 
closely to agricultural life. For instance, in arithmetic, 
instead of teaching stocks and bonds, troy weight, cube root, 
and such subjects, it is proposed that problems relating 
to the dairy, the feeding of cattle, and other farm activities be 
given. It is proposed to put new leaven into old essentials, dis- 
card some subjects of the old traditional curriculum which fail 
to express the activities and needs of the community, and add 
new subjects that are needed for agricultural progress, such 
as nature study, agriculture, manual training, domestic science 
and art, farm management, marketing, rural sanitation. 
After all is said and done, however, there can be no efficient 
country school without an efficient teacher—and that means a
-P-A-G-E-151
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 151 
teacher trained especially for teaching in the right way a coun- 
try school and one who is in sympathy with rural life. The effi- 
cient teacher for the country school must be not only a good 
teacher of subject matter, “giving instruction in terms of the 
local environment of the child,” but also a good community 
leader. She must be able to stimulate local campaigns for rural 
progress. Under her leadership there will be road improve- 
ment, good farmer clubs and institutions, and country church 
progress. , 
Some of the normal schools have recognized the need of 
special training for country teachers and have provided for it. 
At Winthrop College we require all of our normal students 
to take agriculture and to make and work school gardens and 
our seniors to observe and practice in the Training School, 
where school gardens are worked by the children. We give two 
courses for country teachers—the rural life educational course 
of four years and a one-year course for teachers already on the 
field. 
The efficient country school cannot be maintained to any 
extent without trained supervision. To meet this need we have 
a state supervisor of rural schools and a woman county super- 
visor of rural schools. 
At Winthrop College we have an experimental rural school, 
designed especially to show how a single teacher can make her 
school a factor in the life around it. It was established with 
the help and under the direction of Dr. A. P. Bourland, of the 
Southern Educational Board, who was given a small appropria- 
tion by the Peabody Board for the purpose. It has been con- 
ducted by Mrs. Hetty S. Browne under the supervision of the 
State Supervisor of Rural Schools of South Carolina, W. K. 
Tate, and the faculty of Winthrop College. The college furn- 
ished the building and grounds and has met the expense of con- 
ducting the school with the exception of $600.00 given by the 
Peabody Board. 
Children from an adjoining country district are brought to 
the school in a regular transportation wagon for the purpose. 
It has been the effort in the school to work out a course of 
study specially adapted to the needs of the children of the country 
without regard to any established course of study. All pre- 
cedents have been ignored. The thought always in mind is to 
train the farm children for their work and life in the country
-P-A-G-E-152
  152 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
home, on the farm, and in the social life of the country. All of 
the activities of the school are based upon work in the garden 
and have grown out of such work—the lessons in arithmetic, 
reading, writing, spelling, geography, language lessons, cook- 
ing, sewing, nature study, etc. 
The proper recreation for the children and social gather- 
ings for the parents have not been overlooked. The children 
have been led to take an interest in the Boys’ Corn Clubs and 
the Girls’ Canning and Poultry Clubs. 
To give some idea of the spirit and method of the school I 
quote from a bulletin written by Mrs. Browne and just printed 
by the National Bureau of Education: 
“Children were allowed to talk in an comin tone of voice 
when it did not disturb some one else. Bruce wanted to know 
if he might whistle when he sawed. He was told that he might. 
The question of discipline took care of itself. All were busy 
and happy. The teacher’s part was to help the children and not 
to dictate to them. 
“In all of our work we tried to make only those things of 
which we felt the need. The garden lines and stakes were made 
when it was necessary to have them. We soon found that we 
_must have towels. After working the garden our hands were 
soiled. We could wash them at the pump, but we needed some- 
thing on which to dry them. Suppose each one hemmed a towel? 
The towel was accordingly planned and worked out in response 
to a definite need. The amount of material and cost were ascer- 
tained, and then the sewing began. After the towels were com- 
pleted the owner’s initials were marked on them in red. The 
word “initial” was a new one to the children, and as they 
worked each one gave the initials of a member of his family. 
They were taught that a person’s initials must be written in 
capital letters with a period placed after each one.” 
I shall not take more time to give further details of the 
work of this school, as Mrs. Browne is here on the program of 
one of the departments to do that and the bulletin written by 
her and now ready for distribution by the Board of Education 
. will be sent to any one wishing to have further details. 
We do not claim by any means that we have worked out 
yet the plan for the best organization, management, and course 
of study for the most efficient country school, but we do believe
-P-A-G-E-153
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 153 
we are working along right lines and hope that we may con- 
tribute something of real value to the final solution of the prob- 
lem. 
Our students preparing for teaching in country schools are 
given practice in our rural school under the direction of Mrs. 
Browne, the teacher of the rural school. 
THE CHAIR: Hon. J. J. Doyne, who was to have discussed 
this topic is not present. And I have not seen Mr. J. Y. Joy- 
ner, Mr. R. L. Jones, nor Mr. Wm. E. Halbrook. If any of these 
gentlemen are present will they please come forward. I take 
it for granted, then, in the assumption that they are not here, 
that Prof, J. R. Guy is the next speaker. Mr. Guy is the voca- 
tional director of the Charleston public schools, Charleston, 
S. C., and he will speak to you on a very interesting subject, 
and particularly interesting for us, I think, is the subject as 
seen in Charleston. 
Pror. J. R. Guy: Among the many pleasant duties as 
Vocational Director of the Public Schools of Georgia is the 
charge and development of the Negro Industrial School. This 
school was made possible through the efforts of the Vice-Pres- 
ident of this Association, Mr. Tate, and to that, more than any- 
thing else, will belong the credit for whatever good may come 
out of it. I have based my observation largely on the results 
of this school, as we have endeavored to place in it the best we 
knew and could find in the schools which I have had the pleas- 
ure of visiting,—but we claim no infallibility. 
RIGHT KIND OF EDUCATION FOR THE SOUTHERN 
NEGRO IN THE CITY. 
J. R. GUY. 
Mr. President, Members of the Southern Educational Associa- 
tion, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
Education, that is, the proper type of education, is the only 
solution of the Negro question in the cities. It is therefore the 
duty of the public schools of the South to see that this training 
is received. There are, however, many conditions governing 
the situation which demand careful consideration. 
The South is spending thousands of dollars yearly in 
schooling for negroes, and while much good has been accom- 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  154 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
plished, it has been by no means commensurate with the amount 
of time and money expended. 
The fault is not due entirely to the system now in vogue 
in the South, although this has been a great factor in the par- 
tial failure of Negro education. But it is due in a large meas- 
ure to the effect produced by outside influences in giving false 
hopes and aims to the Negroes through a system of schools 
founded, maintained and dominated by men and women ignor- 
ant of that which is best for the people they wish to serve, and 
impelled, in many instances, by the false belief that the Negro 
is a persecuted and much hated race, and that they have been 
specially ordained to correct these imaginary evils. 
Do not misunderstand me. You and I know that there are 
many, many instances of the Negro being the victim of preju- 
dice. Especially is this true in our magisterial courts, where 
the Negro is often maltreated by petty city officials and in 
some cases is considered guilty simply upon accusation. 
It is not my intention to enter into any lengthy discussion 
of the race question, it is necessary, however, that we consider 
several of the more important features affecting the subject. 
1. Education is unquestionably the only remedy for the 
evil, yet it is foolish to apply a remedy before the causes are 
located and understood. When your boy comes to you from his 
play with a long dirty splinter in his foot, do you bandage the 
foot before removing the splinter and cleansing the wound? It 
is therefore our duty to try to find the chief causes underlying 
the partial failure of our system of Negro education, and then 
to apply the proper remedies. 
This, then, is the first thing to be remedied, the presence 
of men and women in the Negro schools who are unsuited for 
the work. The remedy for this wound lies, not in condemning 
them for their misdirected efforts, but in persuading Southern 
men and women to enter the field and to show the world that 
they are willing to master the work of properly developing the 
Negroes of their land into honest, useful and intelligent citi- 
zens. 
Although the present system of maintaining the Negro 
public schools under the same city superintendent as the white 
schools is unquestionably the proper one, yet the psychological 
and economical conditions surrounding the Negroes are so dif-
-P-A-G-E-155
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 155 
ferent from those governing the white children that in 
every school system of any size there should be a spe- 
cial director of the Negro schools, who can and is suffi- 
ciently interested to give his entire time and study to the work. 
I consider this to be one of the most necessary factors in the 
improvement of our system, for it matters not how earnest 
and capable he may be, no one man can give his best work to 
both types of schools. Negro education is a distinctive type of 
education, and should be treated as such. We have superin- 
tendents of rural education, of high schools, of manual train- 
ing, and of domestic science as well as vocational directors; 
and there should be in every state a superintendent of Negro 
education, and in every city a supervisor of this work under 
the city superintendent. These men should not be selected 
politically. Only those should be chosen who are qualified by 
virtue of their birth and environment, as well as education 
have the courage of their convictions and manhood to do right 
as they see it, irrespective of misguided local criticisms. The 
more Southern white men and women engaged in educating 
the negro, the quicker and more efficient will the work be ac- 
complished, because it is a recognized fact that wherever 
brought under the influence of white teachers, the Negro shows 
the beneficent effect. 
The proper kind of education for the Southern Negro in 
the city is unquestionably some type of industrial education. 
The difficulty lies, however, in selecting the type to be given. 
The white child has the entire field of industrial pursuits of the 
city from which to choose; with the Negro this field of choice is 
narrowed down to those occupations open to Negroes. From this 
restricted field must we choose those trades or pursuits ‘offer- 
ing the best opportunities. Although I believe in giving the 
Negro every industrial opportunity, it is nevertheless unwise 
to train the Negro boy in a vocation at which he cannot find 
ready employment on leaving school. 
The question then is what type of training must be given 
and this can only be answered by a careful study of local con- 
ditions. These conditions vary widely in different Southern 
cities with which I am acquainted. In one city I saw but one 
house built by Negroes. In our city of Charleston, most of the 
building is done by Negroes; carpentry, bricklaying, painting, 
   
-P-A-G-E-156
  156 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
tinning, and plumbing all being open to them. It is thus read- 
ily seen that the same type of school would not suit in these 
two cities. This careful selection of the type of training is 
especially required in the small communities for many reasons. 
In large cities, where there are great numbers of Negroes, 
and where the opportunity to follow any vocation can be found 
among their own race, the Negroes should be given training in 
all trades. 
We must, however, do more than give them an opportun- 
ity to secure such training. They must be forced through 
some compulsory system to take this kind of education. The 
Negro must be taught to work. It is more important at this 
stage of his development that he be taught to work than it is 
that he be taught to read. He must be shown that manual labor 
is elevating and honorable for many believe it to be menial and 
degrading. We must go still further. After seeing that Negroes 
are trained in the pursuits best suited to them, we must put 
restrictions on their entrance into vocations or professions for 
which they are not qualified. The best body of Negroes is the 
physicians, for just this reason, that they must pass satisfac- 
tory state examinations to prove themselves worthy. On the 
other hand, let us briefly consider the Negro ministry. Little 
if any restriction is placed on entrance into this profession, 
and the result is that numbers of the so-called Negro ministers 
are ignorant and immoral. I know many good, true, Christian 
Negro ministers who are trying hard to improve the morals 
of their people, but the greatest drawback to their efforts is 
the work of religious parasites who bleed and mislead their 
race. I believe the right kind of education for the Negro in 
the cities is exemplified in the system now in force in Charles- 
ton. Conditions in the schools there are ideal for the develop- 
ment of any system of training for the colored race. The 
teachers, all white, born and reared in the South, are highly 
respected and most capable. This intelligent assistance is a 
great asset, for it matters not how perfect the pedagogy of a 
method may be, unless we have capable and sympathetic as- 
sistants, the results will be meagre and unsatisfactory. 
The Negro children attend the elementary schools until 
they pass through the fourth grade, after which all are required 
to go to the Colored Industrial School, where for three years
-P-A-G-E-157
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 157 
they are given thorough training in the industrial and voca- 
tional pursuits offering the best opportunities for making an 
honest living. The vocational work is thus begun in the fifth 
year. It is my belief that the Negro children should receive 
their industrial training early in life. This belief has been 
greatly strengthened from a study of a series of efficient curves 
that I plotted during the past summer, which in every instance 
brought out the striking fact that the Negro child reaches the 
highest point of efficiency between 13 and 14 years of age. The 
results were the same irrespective of the grade or class of work. 
Another strong reason for early vocational instruction is 
that many Negro children leave school early in life. It is there- 
fore absolutely necessary to see that they receive their indus- 
trial training as soon as they are physically able to perform 
their work. 
The first year in the Industrial School, each day is divided 
into three periods of an hour and a half each. One period is de- 
voted to some industrial training and two periods to academic 
work. This makes it certain that even those who leave after 
one year will have received some training which will help them 
to meet life’s duties. Permit me to say here that the duty of 
the public school is to prepare for life and not for college and 
this is especially true of the Negro schools. Each year should 
offer as much industrial training as is consistent, for 
“Each morning sees some task begun, 
Each evening sees it close; 
Something attempted, something done, 
Has earned a night’s repose.” 
During the second and third years, two entire days of each 
week are given over to industrial work. The major industrial 
subject for the boys is carpentry and each boy has from four to 
six hours a week instruction in this subject. Instruction and 
practice in bricklaying, painting, glazing and blacksmithing are 
given as opportunities present. During the last two years the 
pupils have in addition to the regular class work, built 1000 
feet of 6-foot board fence, a six-room cottage for the janitor, a 
carpenter shop 30x100 feet, and made the tables and other 
equipment for the sewing room, kitchen and laundry. 
The girls are taught cooking, sewing and laundry work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  158 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
From one-third to one-half of their time is given to industrial 
training. The question of the proper public school training for 
Negro girls is comparatively simple and practically the same in 
every city. They must be trained in the domestic pursuits as 
the great number will find employment as domestics or seam- 
stresses. Those who do not follow these vocations as a liveli- 
hood, will be better prepared to manage their own homes. 
Explain Promotion System on Trial. 
Notwithstanding the primal necessity for industrial educa- 
tion, there should be in every city some school where the Negroes 
can receive higher training, since it is necessary to have com- 
petent Negro leaders; and we must prepare intelligent insruc- 
tors to teach in the elementary schools and outlying districts, as 
it is neither desirable nor practical to send white teachers to 
the rural schools, and it is not practical to have them in the 
elementary schools in most of the Southern cities. 
The country is unquestionably the best place for the Ne- 
groes and we should encourage them to leave the cities where 
for the most part they live in congested districts and dirty 
houses, surrounded often by vice and crime. Therefore, in 
every city school there should be a general course in elementary 
agriculture, and even if not one Negro left the city as a result 
of such a course, the effect of the home gardens on hygienic 
conditions would alone repay for the installation. This feature 
has been productive of most encouraging results in Charleston 
as it has enabled us through our home garden contests to teach 
the essential truths of sanitation and civic pride. Likewise it 
has an important bearing on the moral uplift of the race, for 
although we may sometimes find cleanliness and immorality 
hand in hand, we will always find a low state of morals asso- 
ciated with filth and dirt. It is therefore our further duty to 
inculcate by this concrete means, the reason for thrift, the 
reward of cleanliness and love of the beautiful. 
Now a word about teachers—I advise the selection of 
Southern men and women pnly. If ‘you have no specially 
trained teachers in your city, send them away, and have them 
trained in the branches required. This was done in Charles- 
ton, and the success of our work has been due largely to this 
fact that our teachers are Southern ladies and gentlemen who 
have only the kindest feeling for the Negro children, sympa-
-P-A-G-E-159
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 159 
thize with and understand their many difficulties and trials, 
and yet at the same time require and receive the respectful con- 
sideration that is due them from a race of retarded civilization. 
I say this with every respect for the ability of the Northern 
teacher, for whom I have the highest consideration and would 
welcome them in our white schools, but not in the Negro work. 
As “The Right Kind of Education for the Southern Ne- 
groes,” in the city schools this is the system I offer for your 
consideration. Four years in the elementary schools where 
the foundation of reading, writing, and arithmetic is carefully 
laid; then three years in an industrial school in which one- 
third to one-half of the time is given to industrial training, 
and the high school course, where those who qualify may re- 
ceive training for teaching in the elementary schools, of which 
the principals and supervisors should be white. 
Opposed to this orderly system is the cry for promiscuous 
and indiscriminate education of the Negro. This is, my 
friends, just as much the barking of the demagogue as is that 
of no education for the Negro. The masses do not need, nor 
are they prepared to receive the so-called higher academic edu- 
eation. You know that when the pendulum of any reform 
swings too far, the return is in equal proportion; and so 7 am 
opposed to those who would have us carry higher education in- 
discriminately to the Negro on a silver waiter, and then force 
him to absorb it, thereby unfitting him for the more practical 
life before him. 
The Negro is not only willing but anxious to help in his 
own uplift. It is our duty to see that he is shown his responsi- 
bilities, and a ready response will be received. Any attempt 
at uplifting and educating them in which they do not take part, 
morally and financially will assume the appearance of charity, 
and mistaken charity is the chief cause of indolence among the 
Negroes of the South today. We must, then, establish that 
economic mean between the two extremes in which the Negro 
will be the happiest, most contented and most efficient, and 
then protect him in it. That mean is to be found in the indus- 
trial training of the entire race during its early school life. 
Out of this training will emerge those who are qualified to 
receive the highest education and then they should be given 
every opportunity for development. 
In conclusion allow me to thank you for the invitation to
-P-A-G-E-160
  160 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
speak before this Association. In accepting, I did so, not with 
the belief that I could tell you anything with which you were 
not familiar, but with the knowledge that it was my duty, as 
it is of every Southern man, to make a contribution, however 
slight it may ws to the equitable solution of the Negro prob- 
lem. 
(Questions from delegates present brought out the fact 
that no distinction was made among the teachers between 
teaching in the white schools and Negro schools, that positions 
in the Negro schools were considered quite as desirable as in 
the white; that the salaries paid were absolutely the same, 
ranging from $60.00, $65.00 to $75.00, and that in the indus- 
trial schools the teachers were the very highest paid. It was 
also brought out that in Louisiana the same condition prevailed 
as in Charleston—white teachers in colored schools.) 
THE CHAIR: A few months ago I was in Richmond, Va.— 
it has been a year or two now—and some one asked me, “Do 
you know of the work of Jackson Davis?” When I replied that 
I did not, he said, “You are ignorant indeed of certain phases 
of our educational work. He is the best and the brightest of 
our young men, and he is supervising the Negro work. He 
has access to the best clubs in Virginia, he is a Phi Beta Kappa 
man, he is of fine family, and altogether he is doing more in 
Virginia than any other man, other than the State Superin- 
tendent, for the Negro. He is a bright fellow.” 
I have often heard it said that the Negro need not expect 
any harm from the gentlemen in the South. They would al- 
ways give him justice, and I think these lessons from Charles- 
ton, S. C., and Richmond, Va., will bring this home to us. 
I have the very great pleasure of introducing to you this 
morning Jackson Davis, Supervisor of Negro Education for 
Virginia. 
PRACTICAL TRAINING IN NEGRO RURAL SCHOOLS. 
JACKSON DAVIS, RICHMOND, VA. 
Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your kind introduction. 
A few efforts have been made here and there throughout 
the South, notably by Hampton Institute in Gloucester County, 
Virginia, to tie up the work of the country school to the life 
of the home and the farm, but it was not until the establish-
-P-A-G-E-161
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 161 
ment of the Jeanes Fund for Negro Rural Schools that a gen- 
eral effort was made in this direction. In Henrico County, 
Virginia, in the fall of 1908, following a conference of the school 
officials of the county with agents of the Jeanes Fund, a super- 
vising industrial teacher was employed and put to work in all of 
the colored schools of the county. The pioneer work of Virginia 
Randolph in overcoming the indifference of her own people, or- 
ganizing improvement leagues at each school, introducing simple 
forms of industrial work, and in the enlistment of the active in- 
terest of the white people in these efforts for improvement in 
practical ways, met with such success, that a new spirit was soon 
ablaze in each colored community, and the schools were trans- 
formed in appearance, and in the general character of their work. 
Other counties all over the South through the aid of the Jeanes 
Fund have taken up this work and pronounced it good. 
The general plan so successful in its early demonstrations 
has continued to grow and meet with approval. It has developed 
initiative among the colored rural people. It has tied their in- 
terests together in the school for a better neighborhood, and the 
moral effect has been noticed by the white people around them, 
and their support of this movement has been hearty. I asked a 
school trustee in a county where this work and farm demonstra- 
tion work had been going on together for several years, if he 
could notice any change taking place among the colored people 
of the county. He replied that a decided improvement was going 
on, that they were working more industriously, taking more in- 
terest in their homes, their farms and their schools. They were 
so much interested in better schools, that they contributed from 
one-fourth to one-half the cost of new colored school houses that 
had been built. He added that crime was decreasing and bank 
deposits increasing. 
Supervising industrial teachers were employed in 130 coun- 
ties in the Southern States last season. This work has been 
made possible in most cases by the Jeanes Fund, but the coun- 
ties as they see the splendid results are putting up more money 
from local funds for the support of the work, and in some 
counties the teacher’s salary is paid entirely from local school 
funds. To give a concise idea of the definite improvements 
brought about by supervision and industrial training, I give 
the following summary for Virginia: 
For the session 1912-13, 23 supervising industrial teachers 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  162 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
worked in the colored schools of 25 counties. Of the 591 Negro 
schools in these counties, 417 were visited regularly, and a total 
of 2,853 visits were made by the 23 supervising industrial 
teachers, 189 schools extended the term an average of one 
month. Twenty new buildings were erected, costing $23,808, 
and 15 buildings were enlarged at a cost of $2,212.09. Forty- 
six buildings were painted, and 81 white-washed, and 102 sani- 
tary outhouses were built. Three hundred and seventeen schools 
used individual drinking cups. The 428 improvement leagues 
raised in cash for new buildings, extending terms, equipment 
and improvements, $22,655.80. This does not include labor or 
materials given. The whole cost of the salaries and expenses 
of the supervising teachers was less than $10,000.00, so that as 
a result of their efforts they have brought into the school funds 
of the state more than twice the amount expended. It is im- 
possible to estimate the value of this supervision as expressed 
in the practical nature of the school work and the spirit of 
codperation among all classes, which has been brought about in 
these counties. 
Statistics I know are dull, but back of these figures there 
is to me a thrilling story of the efforts of people long neglected, 
now responding splendidly out of their limited means to build 
better schools for their children, to teach them to be indus- 
trious, honest and useful citizens in the counties where they 
now live. 
In sending out trained colored teachers to supervise the 
rural schools we are putting the best leadership of the Negro 
race to work in the task of bringing about better training, bet- 
ter farming, better living among the Negroes in the country 
districts. We must not forget that the old order is passing, 
and the contact between the best classes of the two races, as 
typified in the kindly relations with the faithful servants in 
the Southern home, is growing less. The colored people are 
steadily being segregated, and the danger is that the best white 
people will not know the best colored people. Large areas in 
almost every Southern county are occupied here and there by 
Negro settlements. They do not come in close contact with 
the whites, but are living more and more to themselves. It is 
our peculiar task, therefore, to see that these Negroes are 
given the right leadership in order that they may build up 
among themselves a wholesome and satisfying civilization.
-P-A-G-E-163
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 163 
The school is almost the only point where the conscious 
effort is made by the white people to influence and develop the 
Negro race, and here is a great opportunity for constructive 
work as indeed the supervising teachers are showing. In or- 
ganizing the school improvement leagues they are bringing the 
older colored people together in the interest of better things, 
and they are calling forth the spirit of self help which is in- 
dispensable to their progress. 
In the second place the efforts of the colored people to 
help themselves are meeting with a more generous response 
from the school boards, and decent school houses are replacing 
the neglected shanties that have done service for so many years. 
Thus in Virginia last year 41 colored rural graded schools re- 
ceived from the State Graded School Fund, $6,310.00 for main- 
tenance; 24 of these, more than half, were built during the past 
year, so this movement has only just begun. No school is aided 
that is not properly lighted, heated, and ventilated and provided 
with sanitary outhouses. To meet these requirements and in 
order to secure the graded schools the Negroes have given gen- 
erously. Most of the $22,655.00 which they raised, went into 
the construction of these buildings. 
For example, in one of the poorer counties of Virginia, 
which had had an industrial teacher for two years, the school 
leagues became aroused with the purpose of getting modern 
school houses. I drove with the county superintendent in stormy 
weather over bad roads to five of these meetings in the different 
colored settlements of the county. One of these meetings was 
at a place called Dawn. The day was very stormy, but a large 
crowd gathered to meet us. The building here was an old 
one-room school, cut into two rooms by a partition. It could 
accommodate properly not more than 25 children, but the two 
teachers had an enrollment of 70, and there were 135 children 
in the neighborhood that ought to have been in school. The 
furniture consisted of crude home-made benches, a few pic- 
tures, a battered and torn map, a case for materials, and a 
hornet nest on the ceiling. The redeeming quality of the — 
was its cleanliness and the fine spirit of the teachers. 
The people are now building a four-room school house, 
modern and sanitary, and they are paying fully three-fourths 
of its cost. The Negroes here are not rich, but they own the 
land, and have a permanent interest in the neighborhood. Some
-P-A-G-E-164
  164 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
gave trees which they took to the saw mill and had cut into the 
necessary lumber; some gave so many days labor on the build- 
ing, under the direction of the carpenter in charge; others con- 
tributed in cash. The local school board agrees to provide the 
necessary teacher when the building is finished, and the state 
will give to this school $200 a year for maintenance from the 
Graded School Fund. Truly a better day is breaking at Dawn! 
At another meeting where the school was maintained in a 
room rented from some secret order, we presented the needs to 
the colored people and told them we would provide another 
teacher if they would erect the school house. They readily ac- 
cepted this proposition, and each man told what he would do. 
As each spoke the turn came to old “Uncle” Washington Baylor, 
some 80 years of age, who arose with all the dignity of the older 
generation to which he belonged, and in his own peculiar words 
and manner, expressed his pleasure at living to see such a glad 
day for his people. He finally turned to the superintendent and 
said: “Mr. Washington, you has done turned the kivers down 
and woke us up.” 
The whole scene put me in mind of the Thanksgiving of St. 
Simeon of old. “Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in 
peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.” 
Such scenes as this have become a common experience with 
me as I have gone through the counties with the superintendents 
after the industrial teachers have made the work of the schools 
practical and brought about the desire for definite improve- 
ments among the colored people. 
The establishment of graded schools in this codperative 
way in the heart of the remote colored settlements will soon 
make possible a better supply of colored teachers. The plan 
which some counties in Mississippi and Louisiana are already 
trying, making such a central school a county training school 
for teachers, is one which offers immediate help in this emerg- 
ency, and this plan is likely to spread. 
To show the lack of training among the teachers of Negro 
rural schools, it will suffice to give a few figures from Virginia 
for the session of 1911-12. Of the 2,083 colored teachers in 
country schools, only 15 per cent. had had any professional 
training; 32 per cent. held the third grade or emergency certifi- 
cate, which as its name implies, is not a certificate at all, but 
merely a permit to teach until a teacher with a certificate can
-P-A-G-E-165
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 165 
be secured. The state spent that year on the latter class of un- 
trained teachers, $71,165.34. Of course there are notable ex- 
ceptions among them, some of them are good, and are doing 
much to help their people, but it is unnecessary to add that a 
great deal of this money, if not actually wasted, brought the 
state a very small return. 
One of the most promising developments in Negro educa- 
tion has been the codperation of the supervising industrial 
teacher with the farm demonstration agents, in working during 
the summer months with clubs of girls, who raise home gar- 
dens and can the vegetables and fruits for winter use. This 
feature of the work was begun in Virginia two years ago in four 
counties. During the past summer it was carried on in four- 
teen. Uunder this plan the industrial teachers are employed 
for the entire twelve months. At the close of the school term 
they organize the garden clubs among the larger girls. They 
visit them in their homes, meet them in groups, and give them 
practical instructions for their gardens, and teach canning, 
cooking and sewing in the homes. The teachers are in great 
demand during the summer months, not only among the girls 
but among their mothers as well, for they, too, have been eager 
to learn the “government way” of canning vegetables. Many 
of them have told me they never heard of canning anything 
except tomatoes. Most of the colored homes have a garden of 
some sort, but it lasts only during mid-summer and it is sub- 
ject at all times to the depredations of the chickens and cows. 
It meant a great deal, therefore, for the teachers to get these 
girls and their mothers to take the home garden seriously, to 
have them plant a late fall garden, as well as one for early 
spring and midsummer, and to have them either fence it or 
put it out of reach of chickens and cows. 
It is inspiring to visit these gardens and see the wonderful 
improvements that have been made, and see the hope and en- 
couragement on the faces of the girls when they have learned 
to do old work in a new way and found that it pays, and to see 
the pride and appreciation of the mothers when they see what 
their children have done, and when they realize also that they 
will have a better living for the family during the winter 
months. Most of the clubs meet in a convenient home once a 
week. This home gets certainly for this one time a good clean- 
ing up, and everything is made to appear at its best. While 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
166 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
the vegetables are growing, lessons in cooking, sewing, and 
house cleaning are given. I have seen splendid evidences of 
the cooking which some of these girls did at the end of their 
summer training. 
In one county the cooking club met and prepared a lunch- 
eon for the County Board of Supervisors who were having an 
all day session in the court house nearby. It is scarcely neces- 
sary to add that these men have been warmly in favor of this 
new type of education ever since. In many such ways the in- 
dustrial teachers are wisely bringing the results of their work 
to the observation of the best white people in their neighbor- 
hood. Each county. has an exhibit of the cooking, canning, 
sewing and industrial work done during the year, and always 
a special time is arranged for the white people to inspect the 
exhibit, and they always come and have only words of praise 
and encouragement for the efforts of their colored neighbors. 
I appeared before a county school board last winter to ask 
for an appropriation to employ a supervising industrial teacher 
to do work not only during the school term, but to do canning 
and garden work during the summer. I did not know what 
sort of an impression I would make or what prejudices I would 
encounter, but when I told of the canning work and how it 
meant better homes and better living among the colored peo- 
ple, one of the trustees said that he employed a large number 
of Negroes and that he was heartily in favor of this work and 
any other which would mean better living for them in their 
homes. He said he did not care to employ the kind of hands 
that live out of the country store on ginger snaps and sardines. 
He said that the men that had good homes and lived well, were 
worth infinitely more to him. The board readily made the ap- 
propriation and the work has been introduced. 
In this connection, a country merchant stopped the white 
eanning club worker in one of our counties and said: ‘No, I 
do not want to buy any more canned goods. You have broken 
up my trade entirely. I still have on hand a lot of canned goods 
I got from the factory last year. I cannot even sell them to 
negroes, for they tell me they have got a teacher and are learn- 
ing to do this work themselves.” 
If this could be the experience of all the country merch- 
ants, the South would be much better off, and so would the
-P-A-G-E-167
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 167 
merchants, for if people do not have to buy canned goods, they 
have more money with which to buy other things. 
The industrial teacher literally goes about doing good, and 
her opportunity is as great as her ability. In the summer work 
they are touching directly the homes of the people and bring- 
ing about changes that are having a far reaching effect for 
better living. I know of instances where whole families have 
been saved from tuberculosis by the faithful, persistent efforts 
of the teachers, showing the mother the necessary precautions 
for the prevention of infection when one member of the family 
had the disease. Most of the homes in which they worked are 
whitewashed, and this has a wonderful effect both for sanita- 
tion and cleanliness. They are also teaching them to screen 
against flies and mosquitos, and they are gradually getting bet- 
ter stoves and utensils in their kitchens. As their wants are 
increased their labor must be steadier and more intelligent, so 
that they can supply their wants. 
I have observed that where the superintendents have em- 
ployed supervising industrial teachers and made the Negro 
schools useful in their neighborhoods, prejudice is giving way 
to a spirit of kindly interest and codperation between the two 
races, and invariably those counties that have the best Negro 
schools have also the best white schools. 
Gen. Armstrong, who founded Hampton Institute, recog- 
nized the value of labor as a moral force in building character, 
and in many ways he prepared the way for the general trend 
in education today away from the abstract to the real. 
Work may be simply drudgery, but it can be made intelli- 
gent and it can be infused with ideals, so that it becomes not 
only pleasant but a powerful moral force. Especially is this 
true of farm life. No one can doubt this who has visited 
Negro farmers, who by demonstration methods are now mak- 
ing two and three times the crops with less labor than formerly 
on their lands, and who as a result of this increased prosperity, 
are putting permanent improvements upon their farms, build- 
ing better homes, and taking part in every movement for the 
improvement of the neighborhood. Work that had been for- 
merly drudgery, yielding the barest living, now affords them 
an opportunity for economic independence. It has become the 
avenue leading to spiritual and moral development. These 
farmers who have been waked up to better farming have under- 
   
-P-A-G-E-168
168 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
gone really a spiritual change. They are more ready to help 
each other. The spirit of codperation has replaced the spirit 
of trying to prosper at the expense of one’s neighbor. The 
spiritual change which must come over the South wherever 
this work has been started, will bring new moral forces into 
play for the improvement of the life of all our people. 
Negroes cultivate, either as tenants, owners or laborers, 
farms in the South with an area of 100,000,000 acres. This is 
an area equal to four times that of the State of Virginia. Much 
of this land, as we know, is cultivated in the very poorest fash- 
ion. Much of it is waste, and much of it has been worn out, 
until it is below the level of profitable cultivation. We will 
have a one-sided civilization as long as we have twentieth cen- 
tury methods in our cities, and eighteenth century methods on 
our farms. We cannot afford to neglect any class of our peo- 
ple, for neglect breeds ignorance, waste and crime. Suppres- 
sion is a policy that works both ways. If we deny the Negro 
the training that he needs to make a better citizen and a better 
man and a better farmer, we suppress our rural life and ho!d 
down our average to a lower level, and we continue to have him 
wear out the soil, which is our greatest natural wealth. Train- 
ing of the right kind that will replace obsolete methods with in- 
telligent methods, that will replace unsanitary cabins with re- 
spectable homes, neglected shacks with attractive school houses, 
a superstitious religion with an intelligent work for the coming 
of the Kingdom of God on earth,—this is the rural civilization, 
which some think must be wrought as by a miracle, but which 
nevertheless seems to be slowly evolving as a result of the new 
type of education which I have attempted to describe. 
THE CHAIR: Our last speaker on the program, Dr. Jas. H. 
Dillard, President of the Jeanes Fund, and Director of the 
Slater Fund, will tell us of their plans. 
Dr. JAMES H. DILLARD: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gen- 
tlemen: The saddest sight in the world is the wreckage of a 
human life. It makes no difference how it comes, to see a hu- 
man life go to pieces, not make the best of itself, is the saddest 
of all human sights. I need not speak of the saddest of all, 
that of the loss of the human mind. To see a man so utterly - 
poor or so ignorant that there is no chance for him to make 
anything out of his life is an awful sight, when you come to 
think of it—awfully sad. It seems that here in this blessed, 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
     JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 169, 
beautiful world of ours that there ought to be a chance for all 
of us to make something of our lives, to get not only a living, 
but something of joy and beauty out of life. But as we look 
back through the history of the world we find that it has been 
the case that the great massed majority of peoples have some- 
how—we need not go into speculations—been so situated that 
life was only one long, awful struggle, with little opportunity 
to make the best of their individual lives or to advance the 
race. 
Look at our neighbors to the South of us here in their 
struggles today. What is the matter there? Why, the great 
massed majority have been so long oppressed that there is no 
chance for them. There has been no education for the great 
masses in Mexico, and they have had no chance to develop 
themselves individually. Most of the wealth and property in 
Mexico is owned by a very few people, and the masses are 
wretchedly poor. That is what is the matter now. I rejoice 
when I think of what the real facts are. Mexico today, with 
all of her sorrows and struggles and her turmoils is better 
than the quiet Mexico of the Diaz regime. That was dead. 
This at least is alive. It may be an awful life, but it is living. 
It means that ultimately amelioration will come. 
You may look to any of the European peoples, and you 
will find that this great mass down below there, from the time 
of the days of Greece and Persia, on back there, there has been 
this mass down there at the bottom at times struggling for a 
better life, at times making some progress, but the great prob- 
lem is still here, and in our day, our century, here is that great 
problem still, no question about that. Men have arisen during 
the last one hundred years that have seen the great problems 
of advance, that have trod the right road. It, to my mind, is 
simply the spirit of the doctrine of Jesus Christ. It is just 
that. The world has heard His words, and here and there heed 
has been given to them. Why, in our day, it looks as if we 
were coming into actual fruition! It looks as if we were com- 
ing into the idea, the time when we feel that all men, the low- 
est as well as the highest, shall have a chance for development 
in this world. 
One of the most pregnant remarks, to my mind, that has 
been made in the last century, was that of Massini, the great 
Italian, who said: “We have been talking about the great dis- 
    
-P-A-G-E-170
    
      170 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
coveries of the world, but we are at last making the greatest 
of all discoveries—the discovery of man.” And that is true. 
When you think of how little care there was of human life 
in the ages of the past, it is marvelous. They did not think 
anything of human life at all. Think of the tortures inflicted! 
Think of the ruthlessness of warfare! Human life counted for 
nothing. In our days we are beginning to value human life, 
and to want every man living to have a chance for develop-- 
ment in this world of ours. 
Now, my friends, here in the South, in dealing with the prob- 
lem of the betterment of humanity, we are faced with a some- 
what peculiar situation. It is really a part of the great world 
problem, when you come to think of it. We are faced with the 
peculiarity that so many of our massed majority, if I may use 
that word, belongs to a race so utterly different from ours. 
That is our great problem. Now that is not only the problem 
facing us, but we have a few facts to recognize. I never like 
to speak upon this subject without calling the attention of our 
Southern people to a few facts about it that we had just as well 
face as not. One of these is that this great mass of people, of 
a race so different from ours, is here, and for all we can see, 
is going to stay here. The colored people are not going to die 
out, not within any time that we can count on, at least. That 
is pretty sure. Our great-grandchildren, great, great grand- 
children, in my opinion, will find them here. They are not go- 
ing to move away, as they are moving, to the cities of the North. 
A few, in time, I believe will return to the continent from which 
they came. But the great mass of the Negroes that are here in 
the South are going to continue to be here in the South. I be- 
lieve that this is a fact that we might as well take in. 
Another fact that we must take in is this, that among all 
the people of this race, those who have been more gifted with 
brains, those that have, here and there, had a chance, have 
shown decided improvement. The facts are before us, when 
we take the statistics, that the race as a whole has made an ad- 
vance in the last fifty years that is simply marvelous, in mate- 
rial holdings and intellectual development. These facts are be- 
fore us, and we must face them. 
But many of our friends, who do not know the whole situa- 
tion, do not realize that the great masses of the colored race, 
who still live in the country districts—eighty per cent. in the
-P-A-G-E-171
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 171 
South, at least, are still in the rural districts—the great masses 
of these are today being reached by hardly any of the forces of 
civilization that count for real advance. That is the problem 
before us. It is to bring education to the great masses of the 
colored people in the South. This seems to me to be the prob- 
lem that is facing us. It must be by education that we can 
reach them. 
I do not stop here, my friends, before this audience, to argue 
the advantage of Negro education in the South. I think that 
we have threshed that out. Now and then, I know, there are 
planty of people in the South, and there are numbers of school 
boards, who say that we want to keep the Negro in ignorance, 
but that is a small minority to the many school teachers among 
us who are engaged in education. (Applause). It is a mighty 
small minority. We have sense enough to see, we Southern peo- 
ple, that we can not have health ourselves, and that we can not 
have safety ourselves in our households, that we can not have 
prosperity, and have the South develop, if the masses of the 
working classes are going to stay in dense ignorance. (Ap- 
plause). I think we know that fact. There is no use—I do not 
propose to stay here to argue that fact. 
I take it for granted that we, as educators, believe that all 
of the people ought to have some kind of education to make them 
thrifty, to make them know how to work better, to make them 
want to be better, to give them some sort of stimulus in the way 
or knowledge how to do that work. 
I have heard the President of our Association say that the 
greatest good in forwarding the education of the public will be 
done by our system of public schools. There is no other way of 
tackling it. If I have to say a disagreeable thing I am sorry for 
it, for nobody likes to say disagreeable things. I suppose all of 
you have heard this story. I saw it in a missionary paper, 
probably some of you saw it. An old Indian wanted to be bap- 
tized, and as he was sitting down on the ground in a stolid way 
the missionary came to him and asked him if he wanted any- 
thing. The Indian said, yes, he wanted to be baptized. The 
missionary said, “Well, I would like to baptize you, but I hear 
you have ten wives, and if you want to be baptized you will 
have to tell nine of them they will have to go away. You must 
have only one wife. I can’t baptize you with ten wives.” The 
old Indian sat there perfectly stolid, and the missionary re-
-P-A-G-E-172
172 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
peated, “Yes, you have to go tell nine to go away.” The old 
Indian looked up at him and said, “You go tell them.” 
Now the fact is, my friends, that we are not—I am 
talking here now in the family, so to speak,—we are not, through- 
out the South, in most cases, doing what we ought to do, I will 
put it mildly, that way, for the country Negro school. We 
ought to make a start, we ought to make a beginning. We have 
done it in some places. We ought to carry it on by giving them 
better school houses, better teachers, and a better school term. 
We ought to find a way to do it. I believe we will find a way to 
do it. I think we see signs of finding a better way to do it. 
In this thing of Negro education we have come to the point, 
now, that we ought to recognize the fact that we want the most 
complete codperation of all the forces that can be brought to 
bear to make a better education. I say a codperation of all the 
forces. The Negroes themselves, so far as I can observe, are 
very anxious for an education, they want to educate their 
children. If you go out into the counties you will find that a 
number of the better class of negroes are moving into the town, 
and in nine cases out of ten, if you ask them why they move, 
if it is a small country town with two or three thousand in- 
habitants, they will answer, “We get better education for our 
children.” I have heard that time and time again. 
I believe the Negro is decidedly better off in the country. 
I do not think we want to win him away from the country. For 
that reason I would like to see him get some good schools right 
out in the open country. 
Now as to this matter of codperation, we want trained 
Southern teachers in these schools. We have had plenty here 
here from the North and the East and the West. We want to 
use them, as we have not used them before in the past, and we 
want to show our good will toward them. We want them to 
help us in our system. We in the South here did not make all 
this thing. Our friends in the North know that they are respon- 
sible as much as we are for the presence of the Negro in this 
country. There is no reason, when you come to think of it, why 
the great burden of the education of this great mass of colored 
people should fall exclusively upon the South, and the North 
does not want that. Talk with the people’of the North, and you 
will find that they want to help in the matter, and they should 
help, and it is for that reason that when I was selected to take
-P-A-G-E-173
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 173 
charge of these two funds, friends of mine in the South said 
to me,—these two funds, the Jeanes Fund and the Slater Fund— 
the Slater Fund has been working in the South for twenty odd 
years—a man revered of us all, Dr. J. M. Curry, you remem- 
ber, was agent for that fund—now these two funds given by 
Northern people, who wanted to codperate with the South,— 
but as I said, these friends of mine, men like Chancellor Barrie, 
would stop me on the street, in my old city of New Orleans, 
when I was considering the matter, and urge my acceptance. 
But the leading banker of New Orleans said something that 
struck me more forcibly than any other thing that happened. 
He stopped me on the street and said, “I think the time has 
eome when the Southern people must face this matter, and 
seek to bring about this codperation for the education of the 
colored people in the South.” 
So I am glad that I am in this work. I enjoy it. I feel 
that I am working just as much for our Southern white people 
as I am for the colored people. Everything I do in connection 
with these funds, we are anxious to codperate and we are 
codperating in every way with our home forces of public edu- 
cation. 
The Jeanes Fund I think most of you know of in a general 
way. Mr. Davis has spoken of it. In a brief way, it is simply 
this. The Jeanes fund appropriates to a certain number of 
counties, as many as it can, salary for a teacher who has been 
trained in industrial work, who shall go around to as many of 
the rural schools as possible and get the simplest and most 
home-like form of industrial work started, carried on and 
supervised in the schools. This is a simple plan, but it has com- 
mended itself wonderfully to the superintendents, state and 
county, throughout the Southern States. We have far more 
applications for these supervisors, or industrial teachers, than 
we can possibly respond to, far more. We have this year about 
120 of these workers in as many counties in the South, and 
there could be, and there ought to be, three times that many. 
There is no doubt, to my mind, about the fact—in fact we see 
already the beginning of it—that the counties, as they see the 
advantage of it, will themselves introduce them. 
Mr. Davis spoke to you of the testimony of one man with 
reference to the changes wrought. I had a letter not long ago, 
I won’t take your time, but it was a wonderful letter, from a
-P-A-G-E-174
  174 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
superintendent in Alabama, showing the marvelous change that 
had come in his county since the work was started there three 
years ago by one of these teachers. I won’t take your time now 
to go into that, about the character of their work, but I simply 
want to say this, that from first to last that teacher is simply 
one of the teachers of the county superintendent. He appoints 
the teacher, he pays the teacher, the teacher reports to this 
county superintendent. He becomes a part of the regular pub- 
lic school system of the county. So much for the Jeanes Fund. 
The Slater Fund is a fund about twice as large as the 
Jeanes Fund, that has worked mostly in the schools for the 
preparation of teachers, but from now on we hope, in the 
Slater Fund, to go out into the country more than we have done 
heretofore. For that reason we are offering to establish in any 
county, or to aid in establishing in any county, what we call a 
sort of Central Training School. Many county superintendents 
will bear me out in the statement that it is difficult to get col- 
ored teachers that have any qualifications at all fitting them 
for teachers. The idea is in counties where there is need of it, 
to put in larger and better schools. In counties where there is 
already a fairly good school for the colored teachers this would 
not be needed. The movement did not come from me, but from 
the superintendents themselves. I have had letters from super- 
intendents from all over the South in which they say, “Can’t 
we do something by which we can get some better supply of 
teachers for our country schools?” We do not mean normal 
schools. It would be just a make-shift, but it is badly needed. 
Most of the teachers in the colored schools in the counties in 
the South got what education they have locally. 
From the Slater Fund we might give $500, or more, $1,000, 
if the county wants to establish schools of that kind. So you 
see, according to my subject, which is the Spirit and Plans of 
the Jeanes and Slater Funds,—I have tried to state what they 
are, and to show their absolute codperation with the efforts of 
our public school system toward bettering these schools for 
Negroes. 
My friends, I spoke just a moment ago about the necessity 
of our doing this thing, that for our own salvation, for our own 
prosperity, we must educate the masses of the people. Looking 
at it from a selfish viewpoint, we must educate the masses of 
the people. But there is another consideration—the considera-
-P-A-G-E-175
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 175 
tion of humanity, the consideration of Christianity. We claim 
to be Christians, we talk about our duties, missionary work, and 
so on—here it is at our feet. As Christian men and women we 
can not go to the dark counties of Alabama and see the condi- 
tions without wanting to do something to improve them. 
This Association—the Southern Educational Association— 
was the first to speak in the right direction in this matter about 
which I am talking. It was at the meeting in Lexington—I 
have forgotten just how many years ago,—but at that meet- 
ing in Lexington resolutions were passed that set the key note. 
The most wonderful meeting that I have ever attended of any 
kind was the Southern Sociological Congress in Atlanta last 
spring. The sessions that we had there on race questions were 
truly wonderful meetings. The conference, and the great Hous- 
ton meeting of this Association, would never have been possi- 
ble but for the resolutions passed by the Association at the 
Lexington meeting. I look upon the splendid stand taken by 
this Association at the Lexington meeting as one of the finest 
things that has ever been done in the history of an educational 
association in any country. It was a statement by the South- 
ern white people that we must do our duty in connection with 
the education of the Negro, and, my friends, I do not think 
cur Southern white people will ever be faced by any problem 
they won’t be willing to meet in a splendid fashion if they once 
become convinced that their duty lies in this way—when they 
are convinced that it is their duty, they will arise and do it. 
Now I have said that we people who are engaged in educa- 
tional work realize this fact. The trouble is that a great num- 
ker of our Southern people, our politicians, our newspapers, 
and many other men of influence, have not given the thought 
to the subject that they ought to give it; and I believe that a 
part of the duty of this Association is, as they get the oppor- 
tunity, to drive home the idea that we must face these prob- 
lems—they are here before us, and they can not be shirked. 
(Applause.) 
THE CHAIR: The next subject is the report of Commit- 
tees through their chairmen. We would be glad to hear from 
any one of the committees at this juncture. 
Mr. EvANS: The Resolutions Committee is ready with its 
report.
-P-A-G-E-176
  176 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
Resolved, That the thanks of this Association are hereby tendered to 
the President and Secretary for their labors in behalf of a most successful 
meeting; to the Board of Trade of the city of Nashville for their assistance 
in making the meeting possible at this place; to the Board of Education and 
the Vanderbilt University for the courtesy of their halls for places of meet- 
ing; to the citizens of Nashville for their many acts of hospitality and 
attention. 
Resolved, That especial thanks are due the press for their liberal reports 
of the proceedings, and for the use of their columns in announcing the time 
and place of meeting. We realize sensibly that the public prints are a most 
potent factor in reaching the people and in disseminating the principles of 
education, and we appreciate the cordial support they have ever accorded us. 
Resolved, That the Association learns with regret that Mr. Wm. F. 
Feagin has tendered his resignation to the Board of Directors as Secretary 
of the Association. We feel that Mr. Feagin has taken this step after due 
consideration of his obligations to the new labors involved by his appoint- 
ment as State Superintendent of Schools in Alabama, and that any in- 
sistence upon its withdrawal would be an injustice to him, and would be 
unavailing. 
Resolved, That the Association accept the resignation of Mr. Feagin 
with sincere regret, with every expression of confidence and consideration, 
and with assurances of deep appreciation of his faithful and effective service. 
Resolved, That a committee of three be appointed to report on the 
advisability of closer affiliation among the educational associations of the 
South, with the idea of securing better union, co-ordination and co-operation. 
Resolved, That this committee be authorized to suggest to any State or 
local association or general conference in the South any plan of union or 
mutual relation that may seem advisable, provided that all suggestions and 
the responses thereto received shall be reported to this body at its next 
meeting for such action as may seem wise and proper. 
Resolved, That any bill now pending, or that may hereafter be introduced 
in Congress, for the encouragement of agricultural or industrial education 
by the appropriation of funds from the Federal treasury, should provide that, 
according to the precedent established by the Morrill Act, a just apportion- 
ment be devoted to the white and negro schools of the South. 
Resolved, That the Southern Educational Association reaffirm its faith 
in the improved condition of education in the South; that it looks with 
pride upon the enlargement of school funds, extension of school terms, 
erection of better buildings, and the greater length and security of tenure 
in office. 
We hope that all the agencies will work together with an unselfish patri- 
otism for the upbuilding of our Southern country through the means of an 
ever improving system of schools. 
THE CHAIR: You have heard the report of the committee. 
What shall be done with it? 
Mr. ——————._ I should like to move, sir, that the report 
of the committee be adopted, with the following amendment:
-P-A-G-E-177
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 17 
“Resolved, that the incoming President of the Southern Edu- 
cational Association be requested to appoint a committee of 
three members, the duty of which shall be to investigate the 
subject of teachers’ pensions, and to report its findings at the 
next meeting, together with the practical suggestion of what 
this association may do to further a movement for the pension- 
ing of teachers in the South.” 
Mr. EvANS: The committee adopts that amendment with 
pleasure. 
THE CHAIR: To save time, since the chairman of the com- 
mittee is willing to adopt the amendment, we will adopt it with- 
out putting it before the house. 
D. S. BURLESON, East Tennessee State Normal, Johnson 
City: We had a topic as to whether the six year elementary 
course would be preferable as preparation for the high school 
work. We, however, should like to hear that subject more fully 
discussed, and have it looked into more closely, so I offer this 
resolution: That a committee be appointed to look into and 
study the matter of a better articulation between the element- 
ary and the high schools, and to make a report of such study 
and investigation at the next meeting of the S. BE. A. 
Mr. EvANS: The committee accepts this with pleasure. 
THE CHAIR: To save time, we will not put that before the 
house, since it is accepted by the chairman of the committee. 
THE CHAIR: Is there any further amendment? 
Mr. JOHNSON: I move that the resolutions as submitted 
by the committee, with the amendments that have been ac- 
cepted by the committee, be adopted by the Association. 
Seconded and carried. 
THE CHAIR: The chair would like to have one question 
answered. There were two commissions involved in these res- 
olutions as to the appointment of committees; did you not wish 
these appointed by the incoming President? I think that would 
be better. 
Mr. EvANS: I think it was understood that the appoint- 
ments would be made by the incoming President. 
THE CHAIR: Any other committee’s report ready? 
Dr. J. H. PHILLIPS: There was a committee appointed 
at the first meeting, of the first session of this Association, on 
the subject of Necrology. Your committee, sir, desires to state 
that it is impossible, during a meeting of this character, to 
12
-P-A-G-E-178
178 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
secure data for such a report. Very few names have been 
mentioned to your committee, and we feel that this committee 
ought to be either a standing committee, or a committee ap- 
pointed one year in advance, in order that it may have time to 
get information and prepare the proper report to be submitted 
at the annual meeting. There have been a few names men- 
tioned, but I have been advised by other members of the com- 
mittee that it would not be wise, perhaps, to make a full report 
at this time, but to request members of the Association to 
indicate to me, as chairman of the committee, the names of 
members of the Association that departed this life during the 
year, with some data regarding their work, and that the com- 
mittee be authorized to prepare for the proceedings a more de- 
tailed report or memoir than is possible at this time. 
I regret to make this report, because I feel that the im- 
portance of this subject justifies something more, out of re- 
spect to the memory of those who have been associated with 
this work throughout our Southern States who departed this 
life during the past year. I should have liked to make a more 
formal report than this, and we beg of the Association this in- 
dulgence, that your committee be permitted to prepare a more 
detailed report for the proceedings after information has been 
secured from the members of the Association, and we beg fur- 
ther to make this recommendation, that the Committee on 
Memoirs be appointed by the President for one year in advance, 
—that it be appointed at the close of this meeting for the next 
year, in order that we may have ample time to prepare an ade- 
quate report. This is a partial report, Mr. Chairman, hoping 
to make it more full in the Proceedings, with the indulgence of 
the Association. 
J. H. DituarD: I think that Dr. Phillips’ idea of having a 
committee appointed a year in advance is a splendid one, and 
I hope the motion will pass; but it seems to me with reference 
to this necrology that the more dignified and simple thing, in- 
stead of writing a eulogy, would be, as has been adopted in 
many bodies, the simple statement, just a page or two devoted 
to it, of the names, birth, date of birth and death, and stating 
the length of time that the member was a member of this Asso- 
ciation. If we go into the matter of writing long notices it will 
make, oftentimes, an invidious distinction, while in this way 
all are put on a similar basis,—just the simple fact there to tell 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 179 
its own story, and the length of time the deceased was a mem- 
ber of the Association,—we all have a right to know how long 
he has been one of us. : 
At the recent General Convention in New York of the 
Protestant Episcopal Church I could not keep from being struck 
by the impressiveness of the occasion there. That great crowd, 
a body of seven or eight hundred men from all over the coun- 
try, arose, and the chairman of the committee in the simplest 
way read the names, one after the other, no distinction being 
made, but simply stated, “Member of this Convention twenty- 
five years,” or “Member five conventions.” I wish Dr. Phillips 
would accept that amendment,—just the simplest statement, 
but I do think the committee ought to be appointed a year in 
advance, in order that all the names should be placed on it. 
Dr. PHILLIPS: I heartily approve Dr. Dillard’s sugges- 
tion. In fact, the committee had in mind little more than to 
dedicate a page in the proceedings to the memory of the dead, 
and with the indulgence of the chair, I will take this oppor- 
tunity to ask the members of the Association present to name 
from the several states those who have died during the year. 
I will begin by naming a man from Alabama who has been 
ardent in his devotion to educational work, and who has been 
a member of this Association from its organization, Dr. Jas. 
K. Powers, formerly President of the University of Alabama, 
and later President of the Normal School. 
(————————_) From Tennessee, Seymour A. Mynders. 
Mr. TATE: I think it is only right and proper, in this con- 
nection, that we should mention the name of the friend of the 
South who, although he was not actively associated with this 
Association was, nevertheless, interested in everything in con- 
nection with Southern education—Robert C. Ogden. 
Dr. PHILLIPS: Are there others whose names should be 
mentioned? If there are no others, I move that the members 
of this Association arise in token of their gratitude for the 
lives of these great men, and of their sorrow at their loss as 
members of the Association, and as friends of education in the 
South. 
THE CHAIR: You have heard the motion, that is, that the 
Association rise in honor of the lives of these men. (All arise.)

Gentlemen, I have the great pleasure of presenting to you Mrs. 
Cora Wilson Stewart, of Morehead, Ky., as your second vice- 
president; J. M. Gwinn, of New Orleans, as third vice-presi- 
dent; and your president, this tiny little boy, Mr. W. K. Tate,
-P-A-G-E-181
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 181 
of South Carolina. Mr. Wm. Feagin, of Alabama, your first 
vice-president, cannot be found. 
It only remains for me to thank you for the courtesy and 
kindness which you have extended to the presiding officer, and 
which has made it so easy for him to preside over your delib- 
erations. Now I present to you Mr. Tate, who I imagine will 
adjourn you, unless he has something to say. 
Pror. TATE: I assure you I appreciate more than I can 
express this honor which you have conferred upon me. In my 
own mind, it is the highest which can be conferred by the 
teachers of the South. I have been very much pleased with the 
attendance at this meeting. We have not had the biggest con- 
vention in the world, but I realize and you realize that we have 
had here with us the men and women of the South who are 
thinking large thoughts and planning noble actions, and that 
is what it: takes to make a great convention. 
If I relied on my own strength, I should decline this honor, 
but I am going to rely on your assistance at every point. There 
is a work for the Southern Educational Association, and I 
trust that it may long perform that work with honor to itself, 
and with an increase of vision to the teaching profession of the 
whole South. I want to ask your codperation in doubling the ~ 
membership of this Association during this year. 
I shall ask the privilege, Mr. President, of making all ap- 
pointments of these committees a little more leisurely. 
THE CHAIR: I am a “has been.” He is the president. 
Pror. TATE: (Continuing) and to ask you to dismiss and 
adjourn this convention over which you have presided so ably. 
(———————_) Has the Secretary been appointed? 
THE CHAIR: Mr. R. A. Clayton, of Birmingham, Ala., has 
been selected by the electors to fill out the unexpired term of 
Mr. Feagin. We will ask Mr. Tate to read the appointments. 
Mr. TATE: The resolutions which you have adopted con- 
fer on the president the duty of appointing certain committees. 
I want to ask the privilege of holding my appointments until 
I shall have had time to consider. I will make these appoint- 
ments by mail a little later. 
THE CHAIR: Is there anything further? 
Ladies and Gentlemen, the convention is adjourned.

DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE. 
PRESIDENT—SuptT. D. A. GRAVES, Chattanooga, Tenn. 
SECRETARY—SuvptT. H. J. WILLINGHAM, Montgomery, Ala. 
This department met at 2:30 P. M., on October 31st, in the 
High School Building, with Supt. D. A. Graves of Chattanooga 
presiding and Supt. H. J. Willingham of Montgomery as Secre- 
tary. 
Supt. Walter E. Miller of Knoxville, Tenn., read a paper on 
“How to Secure Greater Efficiency in School Administration.” 
Supt. Richards of Ardmore, Oklahoma, led in the discussion 
of this paper, and he was followed by some others present in 
brief discussions. 
In opening the subject “Results of Industrial Education in 
the Columbus, Georgia, Public Schools,” Supt. Roland B. Daniel, 
of Columbus, Georgia, presented without manuscript a most in- 
teresting discussion of the features, the conditions and the results 
which are being obtained in the industrial high school at Colum- 
bus, Ga. In conclusion he offered for publication in the minutes 
a pamphlet issued by the United States Bureau of Education, 
entitled “Industrial Education in Columbus, Georgia’”—By 
Roland B. Daniel. The department requested that such excerpts 
from this pamphlet be printed in the Association’s minutes as 
space might justify. 
Dr. E. L. Roberts of Knoxville, Tenn., upon the invitation of 
the department, discussed without manuscript for the minutes 
the subject of “School Hygiene”, showing its importance, to- 
gether with methods by which this subject may be made practi- 
cal in any system of public schools. 
“Mechanism and Life in Elementary School Work’ was dis- 
cussed by Dr. J. H. Phillips of Birmingham, and in the course of 
his presentation of the subject he offered for publication in the 
minutes the summary of his remarks. 
In the business session which followed the discussion of the 
program, it was agreed by the department that more considera- 
tion in the future should be given toward a continuity of pur- 
pose in a systematic development of the essential importance of 
superintendence. 
Supt. D. A. Graves of Chattanooga was elected President
-P-A-G-E-183
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 183 
for the ensuing two years, and Supt. Roland B. Daniel was made 
Secretary for two years. 
The President was, on motion, authorized to appoint at his 
convenience necessary committees for the investigation of such 
subject matter as he might deem advisable, said committees to 
report at the subsequent meeting. 
Adjournment. 
SECURING GREATER EFFICIENCY IN SCHOOL ADMIN- 
ISTRATION. 
WALTER E. MILLER, KNOXVILLE, TENN. 
As any reasonable policy must be based upon and modified 
by local conditions, it seems to be proper at the outset to state 
the conditions which face the Superintendent in my own city of 
Knoxville. 
There is a Board of Education of five members, elected by 
the City Commissioners, with powers very poorly defined by 
city ordinance, and all of them supposed to be subject to revision 
by said Commissioners. This Board is composed of excellent 
men, elected for a term of five years. They give the Superin- 
tendent a free hand in most matters, generally allow him, with- 
out a definite Board rule to nominate all teachers and janitors, 
to assign salaries, examine teachers, adopt textbooks and courses 
of study, and in general allow his leadership in all matters per- 
taining to the conduct of the schools. They take but little initia- 
tive in school matters outside of board meetings, unless some 
special fact or condition is especially reported to them. They 
usually, both as a Board and as individuals loyally support all 
acts of the Superintendent. The Superintendent prepares and 
submits budgets of expenses to the Board for their approval, 
attends to minor repairs, and purchases without any special per- 
mission, supplies and equipment, explaining the reason for the 
same when the bills come up in regular meeting. An efficient 
clerk who is also secretary to the Superintendent is provided 
and the office is well supplied with all the aids necessary to the 
proper conduct of the system. 
The schools open at 8:30 and close at 1:30. The rules of 
the Board are very few with regard to the superintendent who 
is practically the master of his own time. By regulation his 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  184 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
office hours are from 2 to 3:30 on school days and from 9 to 11 
on Saturdays; of course, in practice they are any length that 
occasion demands. So far, no “politics” have developed in the 
management of the schools. Neither upon the Board nor upon 
the superintendent have any attempts been made to use city 
politics to influence to courses of action which are not consonant 
with good sense and justice to the schools. 
Our revenues are derived from state and county taxes which 
are fixed by state laws and by the county court, from the tax 
levied by the city government and from tuition from outside 
pupils. The city tax levy is fixed at a minimum per cent. by the 
city charter. It is also under the present conditions the maxi- 
mum rate as the charter limits the entire city tax rate. No part 
of this fund can be used in any way except for the use of the pub- 
lic schools. This plan has the disadvantage of making it im- 
possible to secure an additional sum of money for some extra- 
ordinary expenditures, but has the advantage that city politics 
play no part in securing it. There are no “strings” tied to city 
appropriations; no “log-rolling” to secure them. 
The system embraces two high schools, fourteen grade 
schools, enrolling about 7,000 pupils annually, with 136 princi- 
pals and teachers in charge. There are supervising teachers in 
Drawing and Kindergarten, Manual Training and Domestic 
Science teachers in both grades and high school. We have at 
present no supervisors for primary or grammar grades. We 
have no business manager, but have a custodian of buildings 
who looks after repairs and purchase of supplies under the direc- 
tion of the superintendent. There is also a truant officer to en- 
force our compulsory school law. 
From the above it seems that the functions of a superin- 
tendent in my city may be divided as follows: 
1. Business management. 
2. Administrative in a strict sense. 
8. Supervisory. 
4. Incidental. 
In many cities the first function mentioned is not so much a 
part of the superintendent’s duties as with us for the reason that 
they have a committee of the board, or business managers in 
charge of such work. It certainly would relieve the superin- 
tendent of a heavy responsibility. The second and fourth are 
common to all city systems while the third is done primarily in
-P-A-G-E-185
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 185 
many cities by special supervisors, which as yet we do not have. 
We will now consider in order some principles which it is 
believed will assist to a greater efficiency in school administra- 
tion. 
THE SUPERINTENDENT AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT. 
Whether the superintendent acts largely as financial agent 
of the board, or whether a committe of the board looks after 
receipts and disbursements, he must be thoroughly conversant 
with every source of income and carefully scrutinize every item 
of expenditure. In all cities the problem for school authorities 
is to get all the money possible from the city and state authori- 
ties, use it economically and fully and keep up a steady pressure 
for more. To do the first the board and superintendent must 
be wise politically; to do the second, they must be good finan- 
ciers, and to accomplish the third, they must keep the work and 
needs of the schools constantly before the public. The people, 
particularly in cities, are keenly alive to the value of the public 
schools, and if they are kept informed as to the ideals to be 
attained and convinced of their utility, and are shown the need 
of more money, there will be little difficulty in getting popular 
support when the proper time comes. To stand for well sup- 
ported public schools, is now a recognized asset of all would-be 
political leaders. 
A budget based upon the experiences of past years should 
be made out and adhered to. A liberal extra per cent. may be 
allowed for unusual new expenses and for natural increase, but . 
the balance of the appropriations should stay within the limita- 
tions of the receipts. There has been too much borrowing upon 
the resources of the future, as some cities have found with dis- 
astrous results. Local conditions might affect the budget to 
some extent. In cities where it is safe to predict a rapidly 
growing income from a sane estimate of the city’s immediate 
growth, some speculation might be allowable. In my own city, 
surrounded as we are with small incorporated communities, 
where manufacturing enterprises generally built without the 
city limits, the growth of the tax receipts will be very slow and 
speculation as to greatly increased receipts is out of the ques- 
tion. 
THE SUPERINTENDENT AS ADMINISTRATOR. 
Strictly speaking, the administrative duties of a superin- 
tendent comprise those which he as an educational expert is 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  186 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
supposed to be peculiarly fitted to discharge. Among these are: 
The initiating of educational measures which he favors and the 
vetoing of those which he does not favor; the nomination of 
teachers, their grading and assignment of salaries; transfers 
of teachers and pupils; adoption of textbooks; adoption of 
courses of study, and, in my own city, supervision of all grades 
of work. 
In some cities he has the right to some of these functions by 
statute; in others by board regulation; in others by tacit con- 
sent of the Board and weight of influence; in still others he 
must take what is given him. In my opinion, nothing would 
add greater efficiency to administration of city systems than to 
have Boards of Education to yield full power to the superin- 
tendent to nominate all teachers, assign their salaries and posi- 
tions, recommend all textbooks and courses of study for adop- 
tion. I believe any superintendent worthy of the name should 
strive to have these duties assigned to him, and not rest con- 
tented until he does get it. I have no idea of the number of 
cities where this is the rule, but without doubt where it is the 
rule, the authority of the superintendent is properly respected, 
appointees are chosen for merit’s sake and the best interests 
of both teacher and pupils are conserved. Boards of Education 
generally have an adopted scale of salaries, based upon the 
amount of money they have to spend. They might establish 
the scale according to their means, but the superintendent’s 
-judgment should be the arbiter in placing teachers therein. 
A superintendent entering upon a new work should care- 
fully understand the mode of procedure of the board upon these 
points. It is possible that the board who had never given the 
superintendent these rights might be willing to make such con- 
cessions to a desirable, new man. At least he would not enter 
upon his position under misunderstanding of his powers. Not 
to have a thorough understanding of the relative powers of 
one’s board is a most fruitful case of disaster to a superin- 
tendent. Better is a dinner of herbs with unity than a stalled 
ox with a board with whom you cannot work in harmony. 
The question of adoption of new text-books is always with 
a superintendent. He will always have some teachers who think 
they could do better work if they had a certain text-book. If 
the Board of Education intermeddles with this phase of admin- 
istrative work, the superintendent is indeed to be commiserated
-P-A-G-E-187
        
   
                   
   
          
          
      
    
    
        
    
    
    
    
          
      
          
    187     JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 
with. My plan is when certain texts are deemed unfitted for 
further use, to secure a number of sets of other texts and give 
them to the stronger teachers to use as supplementary work 
for a year. I, too, make a study of them. I hope in this way 
to have a more solid basis of judgment as to the fitness of these 
books than the recommendations of the publishing house or the 
fame of the author. 
Materially changing a course of study is always a difficult 
piece of work. Here is where the codperation of the principals 
and more experienced teachers should be sought by the super- 
intendent. While the superintendent may wish to shape the 
course of study to a different end than that of the old one and 
may direct his teachers to that end, yet the judgment of the 
teaching force is, in my opinion, to be held in the highest es- 
teem in the practical settlement of details. 
Of course, in all these administrative duties, the wise super- 
intendent, no matter how supreme his power, will strive to get 
the intelligent assent of the board, the teachers and the public. 
He must wage a constant warfare of education for his meas- 
ures. If the telegraph and telephone companies and the rail- 
roads are willing to spend so much money and effort to educate 
the public as they do to their utilities and purposes, certainly 
the superintendent of a city school system can more justly give 
of his time and efforts to get people to see the reasonableness 
and rightness of his views. 
In general, for efficient administration, the superintendent 
should have the qualities that make an efficient business man in 
any line of life. He should know how to deal with matters in 
the order of their relative importance. He should have a good 
memory or keep a good note-book. He should transact busi- 
ness with despatch. He should be courteous, always courteous, 
in his official dealings. He must have foresight as well as in- 
sight. He must be brave enough to do his duty under all cir- 
cumstances as he sees it, let the results be what they may. He 
must be able to enlist the enthusiastic services of his subordi- 
nates and especially must he establish a reputation for fairness 
and impartiality. Everybody worth knowing is willing to stand 
for the square deal. He must have due regard for his health 
and take exercise and diversion away from his school work. 
If he can do these things, he will have an approving conscience
-P-A-G-E-188
  188 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
and friends who will stand for him in times of crisis. Lacking 
these, he cannot hope to have an efficient administration. 
THE SUPERINTENDENT AS SUPERVISOR. 
A modern writer on school administration says: “In the 
good sperintendent, skill in supervision is more important than 
ability in business administration. One is art; the other is 
power. Supervision is professional; administration is uni- 
versal. Supervision is an educational matter, a specialty; ad- 
ministration is business management, an executive quality. 
Supervision is an acquirement; administration is largely a 
native quality. There are many men “born” to administer 
affairs; there are none “born” to supervise schools.” 
While not necessarily agreeing with the brilliant writer in 
all of these statements, yet the fact that vital teaching is the 
great and fundamental need in education, marks the import- 
ance of this phase of the superintendent’s duties. Its proper 
discharge results in increased efficiency in the work of the 
young and inexperienced teacher and giving her inspiration 
and vision, in the proper coérdination of the work of different 
schools, and stimulates all teachers by creating a greater appre- 
ciation of good results. Good supervision always encourages, 
never depresses. The skillful supervisor can improve methods 
of work without embarrassment and can tactfully lead teachers 
to better ways of thinking and of doing. Coédrdination is a 
necessity in all systems of activities; nowhere more so than in 
a city school system. 
As shown in the conditions existing in my own city, we 
have no supervision except that of the supervising principals and 
of the superintendent. There are supervising principals with 
no classes to hear in all but four of our smaller buildings. If 
their supervision was always of a high pedagogic quality, if 
routine duties did not occupy so much of their time, they would 
be of much more value in this respect that they are. The super- 
intendent is limited in efficient supervision by lack of time. 
With 121 school rooms to supervise, if he stays one-half hour 
in each class room, going to ten a day, it will take over two 
weeks to get around. In practice, owing to pressure of work 
and other duties, it takes over three weeks and sometimes 
more. It is easily seen that this is not enough to get real knowl- 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 189 
edge of conditions and suggest means of betterment. I endeavor 
to secure better coérdination of work by having principals visit 
other buildings as often as possible, but this does not get as good 
results as I would like to have. My usual plan is to visit a cer- 
tain grade in all buildings, then call a grade meeting to review 
the work, suggest improvements and approve merits. I feel 
sure that the employment of efficient grade supervisors would 
greatly aid in increased efficiency in the supervision of our 
schools. We expect to make the attempt to secure such the 
coming year. 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN COLUMBUS, GA. 
ROLAND B. DANIEL, COLUMBUS, GA. 
In the year 1898 compulsory elementary courses in manual 
training and domestic science were introduced into the grammar 
schools of Columbus, Ga. This then advanced step in education 
in this section was taken in response to a general feeling that 
the school work of this city was not meeting the needs of the 
people. There was not, of course, a demand in so many words 
for practical courses for the schools, but there was expressed 
dissatisfaction with what was offered, and many children them- 
selves showed their want of interest by leaving school as early 
as their parents would permit. 
This work has since been extended through the first year 
and a half of the traditional high school, and differs little from 
the work done in these departments in many other cities. The 
plan has been to devote one double period a week to shop or 
laboratory work and one period to drawing, which to some ex- 
tent is correlated. A building specially constructed and equipped 
for this purpose is used as a manual training and domestic sci- 
ence center for a group of schools, and all shop and laboratory 
work is done here. For the first four years these subjects are 
taught in a very elementary way by the grade teachers. After 
that the work is conducted by special teachers. 
INDUSTRIAL WORK FOR NEGROES. 
Industrial work was introduced into the schools for Negroes 
at the same time that it was given to the white children, but 
since it is not identical it might be well to make some state- 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  190 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
ment of the extent of the work in our colored schools. In these 
schools the industrial, as well as the academic work of the prin- 
mary department (which includes the first, second, third, and 
fourth grades), is directed by the grade teacher. The indus- 
trial work in grades 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 is conducted by special 
teachers for the various subjects taught. One hour per day is 
given in each of these grades to industrial work. 
The boys divide time equally between the work in the car- 
pentry department and the blacksmith shop. The section of the 
grade that gives one hour to carpentry today will spend one 
hour in the blacksmith shop tomorrow. In other words, they 
alternate between these subjects. 
The girls give equal time to cooking, sewing, and launder- 
ing. When a class leaves the academic department it is divided, 
one part taking cooking, another sewing, and the other launder- 
ing; and the next day, of course, they change. 
The child is therefore given industrial work five hours a 
week for five years. This is thought to be sufficient to give his 
education a practical turn and in a measure help him to begin 
the work of life on a higher level than he could possibly do oth- 
erwise. Then, too, such training enables the boy or gir] to ad- 
vance more rapidly. 
* * * * * * * 
The main purpose of the work for the Negroes is to prepare 
them for the lines of industrial work open to them. No at- 
tempt is made to give them training in the use of high-grade 
machinery. The school has developed a number of good black- 
smiths, carpenters, cooks, seamstresses, and laundresses. Pupils 
who remain in the school long enough to complete the course re- 
ceive in compensation for their labor upon leaving school about 
twice what they would receive for unskilled labor such as they 
would be able to render without such training. It is often the 
case that one of these boys is able to earn $2 a day at the age of 
17, when his father, without such preparation, receives $1.25 for 
unskilled labor. 
A SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN OF MILL OPERATIVES. 
Soon after the introduction of manual training and domestic 
science into the public schools a school was established in a cot- 
ton-factory district, under the name of the Primary Industrial 
School, for the children of mill operatives. Since that time the
-P-A-G-E-191
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 191 
name has been changed to the North Highlands School to remove 
any prejudice that might exist against the school on account of 
its name. 
The mill-operative element in Columbus comprises about 
one-fourth of the city’s white population, and there are possibly 
800 children of school age among these operatives. In the ab- 
sence of compulsory education laws, few of these children prior 
to this time attended any school, and when they did enter they 
seldom remained long enough to secure its benefits. Less than 5 
per cent. continued in school after they were old enough to work 
in the cotton mills. : 
This school was first organized in an old rented residence 
ill-adapted to its uses save in the matter of the social feature. 
It remained here for three years, or until 1904, when the board 
of education, in order to more fully carry out the purposes of 
the school, purchased at a cost of $10,000 a large colonial home, 
with spacious grounds, near the center of the mill population. 
The main dwelling, which contains 10 large rooms, is lo- 
cated on a three-fourths of an acre lot, and through the kind- 
ness of the owner an adjoining half-acre lot is used, and thus 
the grounds are enlarged. On the place purchased there was 
a modern barn, which was transformed into an almost ideal 
structure for a kindergarten and a wood shop for the boys. 
This school is not made to conform either in course of study 
or hours to the other schools of similar rank in the system, for 
the board desires to meet the conditions and conveniences of 
the people for whom the school was established. Classroom 
work begins in the morning at 8 o’clock and continues until 11 
o’clock, with a recess of 10 minutes at 9:30. The afternoon 
session begins at 1 o’clock, and the school closes for the day at 
3:30 o’clock. 
The long intermission in the middle of the day is necessary 
in order that children may take hot lunches to parents, broth- 
ers, sisters and others who work in the mills. Many of the 
mills are some distance from the school—some more than 1 
mile away. Most of the children, therefore, walk more than 2 
miles during the noon hour. Besides, many are compelled to 
wait 20 or 30 minutes for the operatives to eat their dinners 
before taking the baskets back. Some children earn several 
dollars per week by carrying such baskets to mill operatives. 
The price usually paid for taking lunch to one person for a week 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  192 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
is 25 cents, and children often take lunches to several persons. 
They frequently style themselves “dinner toters” and the school 
the “dinner-toters’ school.” 
The academic courses in this school are similar to the 
courses offered in the other schools’of.the system, except in its 
severer adherence to the “three R’s.” Knowing that the time is 
very limited in which these children will attend school, more at- 
tention is given to what may be regarded as the fundamentals. 
While the prescribed course contemplates seven years, few con- 
tinue after the fifth or sixth year, so strong is the call of the 
mills. Not more than 1 per cent. finish this school and pursue 
their studies further. i 
The three morning hours and the first hour in the after- 
noon are devoted to academic studies, while the last hour and a 
half of the day is given to practical work. On account of the 
simplicity of the work, one teacher may have three or four sec- 
tions in one room, giving 15 or 20 minutes to the lesson, accord- 
ing to grade. 
There are in this school 175 in attendance at this time. All 
boys are required to take elementary courses in wood work and 
gardening. The shop equipment is simple, consisting of a dozen 
workbenches, with vise and the usual bench tools. The total 
cost of these would not exceed $300. The tools used in garden- 
ing are hand plows, rakes, hoes, spades, pitchforks, etc. The 
value of these is about $50. The boys who work in the wood 
shop today work in the garden tomorrow, and on the other hand 
those who work in the garden today go to the shop tomorrow, 
alternating between the two. 
Girls are given work in basketry, sewing, cooking, poultry 
raising, and gardening. Time is about equally divided among 
these activities. The value of the equipment in these depart- 
ments is about as follows: Machines, etc., for sewing, $100; 
kitchen and dining-room equipment; incubator, brooders, poul- 
try house, ete., $200. | 
In all of these lines of work it is now the hope of the school 
only to better living conditions a little among the people for 
whom it was especially organized. The transformation is neces- 
sarily slow. In the beginning, no doubt, the advocates of this 
type of school thought that many might be induced to continue 
in school and do more advanced work, especially along voca- 
tional lines. In this respect the school has been a disappoint-
-P-A-G-E-193
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 193 
ment to some. We are seldom able to induce pupils to finish 
even the limited course offered in this school. 
The present teaching force was selected from the corps of 
the grammar schools of the city system. Only teachers who 
showed special aptitude for dealing with pupils such as they 
would meet in this school were transferred, and then only after 
they had requested the change. The principal and five assist- 
ants are all women that have had training along industrial as 
well as academic lines. 
The school formerly observed the same time for vacation 
as the regular grammar schools of the system. It was found, 
however, that there was considerable loss in not keeping in con- 
stant touch with these people. After a three-months’ vacation 
it required some time to reorganize the forces that make for 
good attendance and social welfare. Besides, the grounds, with 
the swimming pool, shower baths, gymnasium, etc., are of more 
value to pupils and people (all of whom have access to the 
grounds) in summer than any other season of the year. So the 
school is now in session all the year round, and pupils are pro- 
moted quarterly. The teachers take their vacations at different 
times, each one working three out of four quarters of the year. 
The teachers live in the school, which is open to the people of 
this commuity in the evening, as well as at other hours when 
the school is not in session. 
While this school may not have met the full expectations of 
some of its friends in some respects, it has more than done so 
in others. The social work, such as looking after and advising 
in cases of sickness, has been especially helpful to the people of 
the community. Every day the principal and teachers visit some 
of the homes, sometimes distributing needed charity and giving 
helpful suggestions on sanitation, caring for the sick, ete. 
Confidence is now so strong that one of the teachers every 
Saturday morning collects the physically defective ones in the 
community and takes them to the free clinic for operations or 
treatment. At first parents would see their children die rather 
than permit them’ to be operated upon, but now they seldom 
decline to permit them to be taken by a teacher to the free 
clinic, when in the judgment of the teacher it is necessary. 
The school is used as a medium for the distribution of cer- 
tain charity. One local woman’s club supplies buttermilk in 
summer and soup in winter to the kindergarten pupils, while 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  194 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
another undertakes to keep up a well-selected library suited to 
the needs of these people. A Sunday school class of one of the 
leading churches has installed simple gymnasium apparatus. 
One generous man who is an employer of some of the people 
here donated a high-grade piano, that the young people might 
assemble in the evenings and have music. The best musicians 
of the city sometimes go out in the evening and play for them. 
Other employers often donate cash sums of money immediately 
preceding the Christmas holidays, that Santa Claus may visit 
the school at the appropriate time, bringing joy to the hearts 
of the pupils. 
Organizations for the older people are maintained in the 
school under the direction of some of the teachers. Preceding 
each Christmas, the mothers assemble at the school and aid the 
teachers in making and arranging Christmas presents for each 
of the children. 
The grounds, which are supplied with swings, jogging 
board, swimming pool, etc., are open to the children at all hours 
of the day and all days of the week. It is not infrequent that, 
when the mother goes to work at 6 in the morning, she sends 
her children to the school to enjoy the privileges of the grounds 
until the opening of the school at 8 o’clock. 
While this school has done good work and its benefits have 
been felt, we are sure that the weakest point in it is not being 
able to hold the children long enough to receive its full benefits. 
An enforced-attendance law would aid very materially in this 
respect. 
THE INDUSTRIAL HIGH SCHOOL 
The favorable response of the people and pupils to the sub- 
stitution of practical work in the elementary schools led to the 
suggestion and later to the establishment of a vocational school 
of high school rank. This suggestion was re-enforced by the 
great need of more skilled labor in this industrial community. 
The name given to the school was the Secondary Industrial 
School, but this name was afterwards changed to Columbus 
Industrial High School on account of the seeming connection 
between this school and the Primary Industrial School men- 
tioned above. It was thought in the beginning that the Pri- 
mary Industrial would prepare pupils for the Secondary Indus- 
trial, and when it failed to do this, the names indicated a rela- 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 195 
tionship that did not exist, and they were therefore misleading. 
Columbus, being at the head of navigation on the Chatta- 
hoochee River, enjoys cheap and abundant water power. This 
fact, and its proximity to the coal and iron fields of Alabama, 
make it a manufacturing and industrial center of considerable 
importance in this section. There are located here a number 
of woodworking industries, iron works, foundries, cotton mills, 
ice plants, flour mills, etc. y 
Accordingly, in 1906, largely through the generosity of 
wealthy and well-to-do citizens and former citizens of this city, 
the Industrial High School was projected as a part of the local 
school system, and was formally opened in December of that 
year. It was the first school of this character in the United 
States so established and maintained. 
A lot was donated containing 24 acres, located in the north- 
ern part of the city near the end of the car line, 14 miles from 
the center of the city; and upon this the main school building 
was erected. Since then the city authorities, realizing the great 
benefits that come from ample playgrounds, purchased for the 
school an adjoining lot of 14 acres, making in all 4 acres. This 
acreage will be sufficient to add other buildings and at the same 
time maintain an athletic field for tennis, basketball, baseball, 
ete. 
While it was not emphasized at the time of the establish- 
ment of this school, the pure air and ample grounds have meant 
much to its pupils in the way of health, pleasure, and comfort. 
In fact, all that could be said in this respect for “country schools 
for city boys” can be claimed for this location. Some have en- 
tered this school who were subnormal in physical development, 
but who during the three years out here have developed into 
first-rate athletes. Indeed, the nature of the work within the 
school and the grounds without have produced fine physical re- 
sults in almost every instance. 
* * * * * * * 
The aim of this school is to give to the boys and girls of 
this community and contiguous territory an opportunity to 
make some definite preparation for life’s work, as well as to 
give them the culture that may be obtained from the study of 
the ordinary high-school branches, all of which are taught in 
this school except the languages. It was not and is not our
-P-A-G-E-196
  
  196 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
purpose to make journeymen, but we do so prepare pupils that 
they may begin life upon a higher level than those who have 
not had their activities so directed; and we intend that their 
preparation shall be such that there shall be absolutely no lim- 
itations placed upon their advancement in their vocations in 
after years. 
The school appeals strongly to that class of young people 
who are so industrially and commercially inclined that they 
leave school and accept positions where little skill is required, 
at meager salaries, rather than pursue to them meaningless and 
uninteresting courses. While it was not so intended particu- 
larly, young people are finding the work of this school a fine 
preparation for the higher technical institutions, such as the 
Georgia School of Technology and the Alabama Polytechnic In- 
stitute. About 25 per cent. of the graduates of the school con- 
tinue their studies in these institutions, where credit is given 
hour for hour for work done in the industrial as well as in the 
academic departments of the school. 
The grammar schools provide a seven-year course, includ- 
ing, besides the usual academic work, courses in manual train- 
ing and domestic science, as mentioned above. Then pupils 
who complete the grammar schools may enter either the tradi- 
tional high school or the Industrial High School. The former 
offers a four-year course of 180 school days per year, while the 
latter offers a three-year course of 225 school days per year. 
Pupils in the seventh grade (the last year of the grammar 
schools) are advised of the purposes and training that each of 
the high schools has to offer, and then they are left entirely 
free, so far as the school authorities are concerned, to choose 
between them. 
ok * * * * * * 
Pupils are not admitted to this school until they are 15 
years of age. The average age at the time of entrance is 15.9 
years. They are permitted to enter after they have completed 
the seven-year grammar-school course, making the terms of 
admission about the same as those for the traditional high 
school. Thus it will be seen that this school takes them just at 
that period of life when so many drop out of school altogether, 
and prepares them for remunerative positions which in the 
past they have been unable to secure. 
There is no prejudice against attending this school. There
-P-A-G-E-197
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 197 
may be found here the sons of the well-to-do and the sons of 
the less fortunate, plying their work side by side in their over- 
alls. The school is maintained by the people in the interest of 
no class, and its doors are open to all alike. 
* * * * * * * 
The school day begins at 8 o’clock in the morning and closes 
at 4 in the afternoon, for five days in the week. Only one inter- 
mission is given each day—from 12 to 1 o’clock. For the first 
three years the school was in regular session from Monday 
morning until Saturday noon, but now only those pupils are 
required to return on Saturday who have not maintained the 
required standard during the week. Many, however, do volun- 
tarily come on Saturday for the purpose of working in the in- 
dustrial departments on articles for their own use and pleas- 
ure. 
* * cd * * * * 
The school year begins the first Monday in September and 
closes the middle of July. Formerly the school was in session 
11 calendar months in the year, but experience has taught us 
that it is better to give a vacation of six weeks in place of a 
month. In the first place, the old custom of having a three 
months’ vacation between sessions was hard to overcome, and 
the fact that this school was in session so long after all other 
schools of the system had closed we found was affecting its 
attendance to such a degree that the board deemed it advisable 
to make this concession and extend the vacation two weeks. 
All pupils are required to take academic work of high- 
school grade in mathematics, history, English, and ‘science. 
The extent of the work in these subjects is about the same as 
that of the usual high school. 
* * * * * * * 
The academic work is related as closely as possible to the 
trades courses. For instance, the science teacher codperates 
with the specialist who is in charge of the textile department 
in the matter of dyeing. The chemistry course, so far as the 
pupils in this department are concerned, has special reference 
to the work of that department; while in the domestic science 
department the chemistry has special reference to the analysis 
of foods and their nutritive values. In the department of Eng- 
lish, pupils are required to take topics from their trades courses 
as subjects for themes, and the special teachers of the head of 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
198 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
the English department criticizes and grades them with refer- 
ence to their form and literary value. The problems in mathe- 
matics used in the classroom grow largely out of the work of 
the shops. And the history teacher presents his subject espe- 
cially from the industrial point of view. 
VOCATIONAL COURSES. 
All pupils, besides being required to take the full three- 
year academic course, must choose one of the trades courses. 
One-half of each day is devoted to the industrial work and the 
other to academic studies. That pupils may keep in touch with 
real conditions in industrial life, they make frequent excursions 
under the direction of teachers to the mills, foundries, and ma- 
chine shops. They there see work carried on in a large way 
similar to what they are attempting to do in a small way at 
school. Classes are carried, of course, where the work is sim- 
ilar to that which they are undertaking to do in the school shop; 
that is, textile pupils visit the cotton mills, while mechanic arts 
pupils visit the machine shops, foundries, etc. These visits are 
made about once a month, and the classes are absent from the 
school about two hours on each trip. The heads of the depart- 
ments of the larger manufacturing plants have all shown a 
real interest in the students of the school and not only per- 
mitting them to visit the factories, but in explaining and call- 
ing attention to all special features. 
The school offers for girls trades courses in millinery, 
dressmaking, and business training, while every girl is required 
to take the course in home economics. For boys, trades courses 
are offered in carpentry, machinery, textile work, and business 
training, and all boys taking the courses offered in the mechan- 
ical and textile departments are required to take a three-year 
course in mechanical drawing, that they may be able to make 
working drawings of machines and to build machines from 
blue prints down to scale. 
* * * * * * * 
Before a pupil can graduate, he must not only complete 
the three-year course in the academic subjects and trades 
courses, but he must take a position six weeks before the date 
of his graduation and must “make good,” so to speak, under 
ordinary commercial and industrial conditions. Suitable work 
   
-P-A-G-E-199
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 199 
is secured for the pupils regardless of the compensation, and 
reports are received daily on the efficiency of their labor. 
There has been a gradual increase in attendance from the 
beginning. The enrollment four years ago was less than 100, 
while at present it is 156. In the first graduating class there 
were only 9 members; in the class of 1913 there were 35. There 
have been, to date, 87 graduates and, with 3 exceptions, they 
are pursuing lines of work begun in this school. At first they 
do not receive high salaries, but promotion has been rapid and 
certain. The class of 20 last year found places to work imme- 
diately after graduation at salaries ranging from $35 to $50 
per month. The 8 members of the class who were graduated 
four years ago are receiving salaries ranging from $75 to $125 
per month. It must be borne in mind, too, that not one of 
these is more than 22 years of age. The combined salaries of 
the last class to graduate would maintain the school for the 
present year. The value of the training in this school is not 
represented by its graduates only, for there are some who were 
unable, for financial and other reasons, to complete the course 
who are showing in their various lines of work the effect of 
even partial training in this shcool. The average cost of main- 
taining the school is about $60 per capita per annum. 
* * * * * * * 
Effort has been made to secure teachers for this school 
who have had both professional training and experience in bus- 
iness or in the industries. Those teachers in close touch with 
practical life are more likely to be in sympathy with the ideals 
of this school. It is essential to success that those who are to 
work in the school should believe in it. Besides, no one is en- 
tirely qualified to give instruction and direction in the indus- 
tries who has not been actually employed in them. In so far as 
it is possible to secure them, we employ teachers who happily 
combine both the theoretical and practical; that is, have had 
scientific training and practical experience. 
* * * * * * * 
The attendance at the traditional high school has not been 
materially diminished by the establishment of this new school. 
Work of the high school is really more satisfactory than for- 
merly, for only those are attending this school who choose the 
kind of education that it offers. These desire to learn some- 
thing of the languages rather than to take one of the trades

courses offered in the other school. Pupils who are preparing 
to take classic college courses usually come here, while those 
who are preparing for higher technical schools or who wish to 
learn a trade along with their regular school work usually go 
to the Industrial High School. It is entirely safe to say that 
two-thirds of the students at the Industrial High School would 
not continue beyond the grammar-school grades if it were not 
for the vocational courses offered. Indeed, there ‘is strong 
reason for believing that a goodly number of these would not 
have even completed the grammar-school grades without such 
incentive. 
The vocational courses thus far introduced in this school 
were selected to meet local conditions and needs. There is now 
a strong demand for a course in practical electricity and also 
one in agriculture. The growing demand for the former is due 
to the development in the last two or three years in this vicinity 
of great water power on the Chattahoochee River, and the lat- 
ter because of increased interest in recent years in intelligent 
and scientific agriculture in this section. 
MECHANISM AND LIFE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
WORK. 
J. H. PHILLIPS, BIRMINGHAM, ALA. 
Organization has come to be the biggest word in the dic- 
tionary of modern civilization. As in the biological world, so 
in the industrial, commercial, social, religious and educational 
fields, organization is essential to growth and efficiency. From 
simplicity to complexity is the order of development in all or- 
ganization, from the unicellular protozoa to the complex organ- 
ism of the human body; from the primitive sickle of our fore- 
fathers to the modern harvester, and from the absolute mon- 
archy of ancient history to our highly organized democracy of 
today. Every organization consists of closely related mechan- 
ical parts, each so constructed and adjusted as to coéperate with 
all the other parts in attaining efficiently the general purposes 
of the organization. 
Every organization thus implies three essentials: The end 
or purpose to be subserved, the subsidiary or mechanical means 
contrived to accomplish that purpose and the efficient vital or 
motive power behind the mechanism of the organization. Com-
-P-A-G-E-201
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 201 
plexity of organization and perfection of mechanical contriv- 
ances are of little worth, if the ends to be subserved are insig- 
nificant, or the motive force is inefficient. In biological evolu- 
tion, the animal organism grows in complexity of structure in 
proportion to the increase of significance in the total purpose 
to be subserved, but when the vital force is extinguished, the 
decomposition of the organ must inevitably follow; the organ- 
ism is dead. 
The school is a social organism, and while biological and 
mechanical analogies may be suggestive, and helpful, they must 
not be carried too far. The biological analogy as applied to the 
school is applicable only in so far as it suggests a definite aim 
or purpose, a system of mechanically adjusted means designed 
to accomplish the end in view, and the life giving energy which 
must vitalize the mechanical elements, and give efficiency to 
the organization. The public school, even when reduced to its 
lowest terms, is a complex organism. Primarily, it includes the 
teacher and a group of children, ungraded, or it may be of a cer- 
tain grade in a school. But this is not all. If there were no 
other factors, the school would be a very simple organism. There 
are the parents of the children, the taxpayers of the community, 
the district school officers, the County Superintendent and the 
authorities of the State Department. In the towns and cities, 
there will be other factors to be considered. The teacher and 
group of children constitute a grade in a school of several sim- 
ilar grades, with an executive principal in charge. This school 
in turn is a part of a system containing a number of similar 
schools, under the direction of a Superintendent, and the whole 
system is managed and directed by a Board consisting of citi- 
zens variously chosen to represent the taxpayers of the com- 
munity in the management of the school system, and this Board 
in turn is subject to the State Law and to the direct authority 
vested by that law in county or state authorities. Some of these 
factors are far removed from the school, but their efficiency in 
the performance of their specific functions is essential to the 
efficiency of the primary unit of the organization. Unlike its 
mechanical or biological prototype, the school organization con- 
sists of various conscious and purposive factors, all of which 
must function consciously to accomplish the desired end. All 
must codperate to render most effective the work of the primary 
unit,—the teacher and class in the elementary school.
-P-A-G-E-202
  202 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
In this primary unit must be combined the motive power 
and a consciousness of the purpose to be attained. The teach- 
er’s function in the school is so important, that the efficiency of 
all other factors in the organization may be rendered negative 
by weakness or incompetency at this point of vital contact. An 
incompetent teacher may render futile the efforts of the State, 
defeat the plans of school officers, waste the funds provided by 
the taxpayers, and disappoint the hopes of parents whose sacri- 
fices for their children are made of no avail. The most per- 
fectly organized school system, city, county or state, must fail 
in the accomplishment of its purpose if it breaks down at this 
point. No one can compute the loss to the community when 
ignorance and incompetency are entrusted with the instruction 
of the children. 
On the other hand, the most competent teacher may be 
hampered by incompetent officials, handicapped by the nig- 
gardly provision made by the state and the community in the 
way of suitable buildings and equipment, or thwarted by an 
inflexible organization that stands as a bar to all progressive 
work. A good school is the result of the helpful codperation 
of all the members of the organization, concentrating their 
accumulated power in the teacher, who is the alchemist that 
transmutes the results of organization into life. 
Each class room in the elementary school is an organ- 
ism in itself, consisting of a number of pupils of varied tem- 
peraments and dispositions, bringing with them inherited and 
acquired peculiarities as various as the homes represented. 
Here the teacher must be the organizing force, and the char- 
acter of the organization will necessarily vary with conditions. 
The good teacher must provide a mechanism adequate to 
the needs of good order and every regulation and mechanical 
contrivance must be so adjusted as to accomplish a specific 
purpose. A large part of the routine work of the school may 
be so organized as to become automatic, resulting in the pres- 
ervation of good order, preventing friction, economizing time 
and enabling each pupil to do his best. Good order in the 
school is a matter of habit, and good habits should be practiced 
until they become automatic. The mechanism of the school 
should be so designed as to make the acquirement of good habits 
a means of character training. But no matter how perfectly 
adjusted this mechanism may be, it must fail to accomplish the
-P-A-G-E-203
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 203 
end unless the right motive power is applied. If that motive be 
fear of punishment, or the hope of some tangible, external and 
artificial reward, offered as a kind of bribe for compliance, a 
species of order and discipline may be obtained temporarily, 
but it will be weak in moral value and will not be a permanent 
help to the school nor a valuable element in the character of the 
pupil. Such incentives may be used in some classes until higher 
motives may be employed. Usually, however, the teacher that 
learns to rely upon low incentives cannot do without them. The 
motive power that should vitalize the mechanism of the class- 
room is the codperation of teacher and pupils for the attainment 
of specific ends. Voluntary activity and spontaneous acquies- 
cence in all requirements should be the habitual attitude of mind 
developed in the pupils. The spirit of codperation is contagious, 
and the pupils under the guidance of a tactful teacher, may 
even participate in modifying or adjusting the mechanism of 
routine work in the classroom. In the work of instruction, 
likewise, the successful teacher will be able to breathe a new 
life into some of the dry topics of the course of study by secur- 
ing the codperation of the class membership, giving them the 
opportunity not only to learn, but to teach as well. Each fac- 
tor of the primary organization must be made to function, if 
the purpose of the school is to be fully realized. But there are 
factors outside as well as within the school, that must be made 
to function in co-operation with the teacher. The parents and 
taxpayers of the community, the school officers, the ministers 
and the churches,—all are related factors of the school organ- 
ism and the teacher who has won their sympathetic codpera- 
tion has succeeded in developing within the mechanism of the 
school the maximum of life and power. 
What I have said regarding the organization of the single 
school may apply in principle to a system of schools, in town, 
city or state. In some of our Southern States, there is a dan- 
gerous tendency to concentrate power in the hands of the officials 
of the State Department; to direct or limit local. initiative and 
control, and by extending and magnifying the power of the State 
organization, to minimize the opportunities and privileges of 
those nearest to the problems to be solved. This same danger 
exists in some of our city school systems, when the Board of 
Education or the superintendent, by prescription through an 
inflexible course of study, imposes uniform requirements upon 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  204 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
all teachers and all classes regardless of local conditions. That 
may be a perfect piece of educational mechanism that makes it 
possible for some one man to say: 
“Every child in France has a reading lesson at ten o’clock 
this morning’’; but any sensible teacher will pronounce such an 
organization objectionable, because the executive power is too 
far removed from the point of vital application. 
As the successful operation of the elementary school de- 
pends less upon the external form of its organization than upon 
the spirit of codperation which constitutes its real life, so it is 
with a system of schools. It is the inner life that determines 
the outward form; and variation rather than uniformity char- 
acterizes living social organisms. The unfortunate craze for a 
“dead-level” of uniformity in state, county or city, is the chief 
curse of modern education. It crushes the spirit out of the 
body and places a premium upon a lifeless organization that 
breeds indifference and inefficiency. The multiplication of un- 
necessary reports, useless records and fruitless statistics, too 
often indicates a mechanical and soulless educational adminis- 
tration. In nature, the useless organ becomes absorbed or at- 
rophied. Occasionally the surgeon’s knife is required to save 
the organism. Many of our school systems require a surgical 
operation to save the life of the patient. We need to eliminate 
the useless and purposeless mechanism that so often wastes the 
life of the school. 
The merits or demerits of a school or a system of schools 
cannot be demonstrated by mathematics. Figures too often 
prove little and establish less, because the real life of the school 
cannot be expressed in statistics. Surveys and expert investi- 
gations will prove helpful only as they penetrate the surface of 
organization and mechanism and reveal the spirit and life that 
lie within. Statistics are valuable for certain purposes, but the 
problems of the school present too many unknown and variable 
factors,—too many indeterminate coefficients, to admit of easy 
and exact mathematical solution. 
School organization should be emphasized only as a means 
to an end, and mechanism should be subordinated to the spirit- 
ual purposes involved. The spirit of authority in Board of 
Education, superintendent, principal, teacher, pupil and parent 
must yield to the spirit of codperation. When this spirit dom- 
inates the activities of the school authorities and the teachers,
-P-A-G-E-205
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 205 
it will enter the classroom and the home, and permeate and in- 
spire all the relations and activities of the school. Military 
authority is not calculated to inspire voluntary self control or 
to develop any high sense of moral responsibility. ‘Like begets 
like” is as true in the moral as it is in the biological world. 
Kindness, courtesy, sympathy, charity and good will, if given a 
fair opportunity, multiply and replenish our little sphere. 
When this spirit permeates the school organization, and binds 
all its factors together in a spiritual union, it inspires the high- 
est ideals of conduct, it solves problems of school discipline, it 
vitalizes the work of instruction, and creates an atmosphere of 
helpful and unselfish codperation in the school. 
But, the organization inspired by this spirit looks beyond 
the precincts of the school. The life of the school becomes the 
center of community life, and the purposes of the school are 
broadened so as to include the welfare of the entire community. 
Parents’ associations will be established, extension lecture 
courses will be maintained, and parents and children together 
will rejoice in the spirit of codperation that radiates from the 
school. All the available resources of community life will be 
drafted into the service of the school; all the professional, in- 
dustrial and artistic assets of the community will be organized 
and utilized, welded together by the spirit of life, for the edu- 
cational advancement of all the children and all the people. 
A PLEA FOR MORE ATTENTION TO THE CHILD’S 
PHYSICAL WELFARE. 
E. L. ROBERTS, NASHVILLE, TENN. 
(Prepared for Department of Physical Education.) 
Just forty years ago the public school system of Tennessee 
was established. Possibly the system of some State represented 
in this Association is not this old; but even if they are all this 
old, they are all young, and yet not young enough for any one 
to question their value. Can you find a man among you today 
who would favor abolishing State education? Probably you 
ean find a few, but not many such can be found. And while 
our present educational systems are not perfect, we can hardly 
think of our country today without universal education, and our  
-P-A-G-E-206
  206 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
coming together at this time is only to make the various sys- 
tems of our Southern States more perfect. 
Today no man would contend that the child born into this 
world would fare just as well without an education as with one; 
every one concedes the value of educational training. The 
training must begin early and continue over quite a number of 
years. In England the child may enter school at the age of 
three and must enter at the age of five. In this country the 
age at which he must enter is only a little more advanced. In 
our age an education is not considered merely an accumulation 
of facts of a gathering of information; it is training of the 
mind, a development of the intellect. 
What would any of you think of a system of education 
that maintained a laissez-faire attitude towards the child’s men- 
tal welfare?—a system that said just let the child alone, his 
mind will grow all right. Just wait till he shows signs of 
mental weakness, mental abnormality, even imbecility, and then 
we will have him examined and see if something can be done 
for him. You say that such a system would not be good non- 
sense; and that our attitude towards the child’s mental condi- 
tion and development must be a positive one. 
How much more important is it to look after the child’s 
mental welfare than it is to look after his physical welfare? 
How much more necessary is it to look after the mental than it 
is to look after the physical? J want to be heard especially on 
this point. Was our attitude of a hundred years ago right in 
regard to the child’s mind? By our present-day educational 
systems we say emphatically no! Then, I ask, is our present 
attitude towards the child’s physical welfare right? In this 
matter we have naturally and gradually come to think that 
whatever is is right. We have so long been accustomed to 
thing that of course the boy will get along all right if we let 
him alone, that when a person suggests that our position in the 
matter is not right, it is almost impossible to get any one to 
understand what we mean. What I want to say is this: It is 
just as important and just as necessary that we care for the 
physical development as it is that we care for the mental de- 
velopment of our children. The State’s attitude towards the 
boy’s physical development is no more correct today that the 
State’s attitude towards his mental development was correct a 
hundred years ago. It is just as unreasonable to think that the
-P-A-G-E-207
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 207 
child will grow into a strong man physically without special 
training and care as it is to think that he will grow into a 
strong man mentally without special training. After the State’s 
attitude towards the child’s mental well being has undergone 
such a revolution in the last hundred years, it is strange how dif- 
ficult it is to get educators—public educators—to think that it is 
even possible for the State’s attitude on the physical welfare side 
to be wrong. 
Some suggestions will now be made in regard to what may be 
done for physical improvement of children. Efforts should be 
directed along three lines. These three lines are not separate and 
distinct all the way by any means. They frequently overlap each 
other. The work of one encroaches upon the work of the other. 
One of these lines of endeavor consists of active measures for de- 
veloping the physical child; another of these measures consists of 
efforts to protect the child from his environments in so far as 
they would be dangerous to his physical wellbeing, and the third 
consists of efforts directed to finding and correcting defects of a 
physical nature already existing in the child. When these three 
lines of endeavor have been properly correlated and applied a 
better physical man must be the result. Nothing else will be pos- 
sible. 
Before going further allow me to call your attention to the 
fact that nothing has been said about applying these measures to 
school children or to any other children in particular. Already 
in this paper the State’s work along the line of universal educa- 
tion has been mentioned; and the point sought to be made in that 
connection was not that the State should look after the physical 
welfare of school children, but that as the State, through the 
school is looking after the mental welfare of all its children, so 
the State should, through some means equally as effective look 
after the physical welfare of all its children. If the machinery 
employed in the one work can be utilized to advantage for the 
other work, all well and good, but one point that I desire to em- 
phasize is that one of these lines of endeavor is not necessary to 
the other. The mental is not to be subordinated to the physical 
nor is the physical to be subordinated to the mental. Each is 
equally as important as the other and each is to be considered in- 
dependent of the other. Really, as a matter of fact, the State’s 
work along the line of physical welfare will take a wider scope 
than it will along the line of the mental welfare.
-P-A-G-E-208

The first line of endeavor mentioned above is that of develop- 
ing the physical man. To some minds such a work on the part of 
the State will appear unnecessary; to others it will appear un- 
reasonable. And yet, why should it do either? One will not 
argue that it is not well for a man to have the strongest and 
best body that it is possible for him to have. Neither will one 
argue that he can ever have the best body possible without spe- 
cial cultivation any more than he can have the best mind possi- 
ble without cultivation. If one does so argue, he appears to me 
to be unreasonable; he does not expect such of his grain, of his 
hogs, or of his horses. He knows that they must receive the 
most careful attention, then why does he not concede the same 
in regard to man? But some one says do you want the State 
to establish institutions for developing the physical man? To 
which question I unhesitatingly answer, yes, if that is the only 
way to get physical culture and development. We have estab- 
lished such institutions for the development of the mind and 
it is not unreasonable to do as much for the body—unless it be 
possible that you consider that the body is an unimportant part 
of the man. 
In our present state of physical welfare development, how- 
ever, no special or separate institutions are necessary. For the 
present we can utilize what we have. The public school is the 
institution already in existence which can be utilized for this 
purpose. It furnishes the machinery, but not all the means for 
such a work. The means must be a matter of growth, and will 
be, as physical development work is from time to time intro- 
duced into our various educational systems. One thing we 
should be guarded about. We should not introduce physical 
culture work as if it were merely a means to education. It 
must be introduced for its own sake and for its own value, and 
not be looked upon as secondary to anything. For years to 
come such work as this will be looked upon as necessary only 
in the cities, and while it is undoubtedly needed there more 
than in the country, its value everywhere must be recognized 
sooner or later. Lack of time forbids even a brief discussion 
of a course of physical development work. 
The second line of endeavor mentioned for the making of 
a better man is the protection of the child—or adult, if you 
please—from his environments. Such endeavor applies not 
only to school life, but to all ages. Only brief mention can be 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 209 
  made of this work just here. If school life is considered, the 
problems to be attended to are those of heating, seating, light- 
ing and ventilating. Also the problems of furnishing water 
and preventing the spread of contagious diseases are to come 
in for due consideration. If life outside of the school room is 
to be considered, many problems of sanitation are to be solved. 
Good water must be furnished; laws must be passed to prevent 
‘the sale of adulterated food; all that can, must be done to pre- 
vent the spread of contagious and infectious diseases. In this 
day of vaccine prophylaxis much has been done and much more 
will be done along this line. 
The last of the three means used for the making of a better 
physical man, consists of detecting and correcting physical de- 
fects. This work, to be most effective, must of course be mainly 
directed to the child, hence the school is the institution in which 
most of this is to have its beginning; but not all of it is to begin 
here, for much can and should begin before the age of school 
life. The work consists of thorough routine physical examina- 
tions for the detection of disease or defects, follow-up work be- 
ing constantly employed for the removal of all defects that can 
be removed. Let it be understood just here, however, that med- 
ical inspection or examination of school children is neither be- 
cause of, nor in order to public education. The average advo- 
cate of medical work in the school speaks of it as if he were 
apologizing for the harm that public schools do and that the 
medical work was merely an effort to overcome that evil as far 
as it is possible to do. In fact they often go so far that their 
advocacy is a serious reflection on the public school system. 
They seem to labor under the impression that the school is a 
place where the child’s general health is likely to be seriously 
impaired and hence while he is in school he must be watched 
by the school physician to prevent, if possible, a complete break- 
down; or they seem to labor under the impression that the child 
is constantly in danger of infectious diseases because of his 
presence in the public school room, and hence must be constantly 
watched to prevent such a misfortune. 
Such views are groundless. I repeat that medical exam- 
ination of school children is neither because of nor in order to 
public school work. Public school work does not make physical 
welfare work necessary, nor does it remove the necessity for it. 
Medical work among children is necessary entirely independ- 
“4 
   
-P-A-G-E-210
  210 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
ent of any connection that the child may have with school. Of 
course if a child is suffering with physical defects, that fact 
probably handicaps him in his work, and a removal of the phy- 
sical defect will probably help him in his work. If their re- 
moval will help in his school work, why of course they should 
be removed for that benefit, but that is not the principal reason 
why they should be removed. The primary reason for remov- 
ing them is the benefit such removal will be to the physical 
child. In other words, we are not to make the child well simply 
that he may get an education; we are to make him well for the 
sake of being well, even if he never learns to read a line. 
A few words now about the details of the medical man’s 
work in the school. As the work is now done throughout the 
country there are medical inspectors and medical examiners. 
While these terms are frequently used interchangeably, they 
should never be and their difference should be kept clear. The 
duty of the medical inspector is much more superficial than that 
of the medical examiner. The proper sphere of the inspector is 
that of making daily visits to a number of school buildings 
under his supervision and seeing all children who show any 
symptoms of acute illness. This work is done particularly to 
prevent the spread of contagious diseases, and certainly is very 
effective. Under some circumstances he may even go so far as 
to make routine inspection of all the children in the building. 
The work of the medical examiner is to give the children under 
his charge a thorough physical examination for the detection 
of such chronic physical defects as the child may be suffering 
with. Such an examination may take in the entire body or it 
may be very limited in its scope. For instance, it may be lim- 
ited to eye, ear, nose, and throat work. This is frequently as 
far as it goes, the position being taken, and reasonably so, I 
think, that diseases or defects of these organs stand more di- 
rectly between the child and his school work than any other 
diseases. I have already made it quite plain in this paper—at 
least I have tried to—that the correction of physical defects 
should not be made secondary to the mental welfare, and it is 
not necessary to re-open that question here, but speaking 
strictly from the school board’s standpoint the argument that 
defects of eye, ear, nose, and throat should be removed because 
they stand in the way of hissschool progress, and hence inter- 
fere with the work which it is their duty to carry on, is good
-P-A-G-E-211
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 211 
and effective, and may be used where necessary, till we can all 
take that broader view which I have mentioned before—namely 
that the child’s body should be made well and strong for its 
own sake, just as the child’s mind should be made strong and 
sound for its own sake. 
The examination may not apply to the organs named at 
all, but may be made for the detection of troubles of the heart 
or lungs or both. Again, it may be made with a view to help- 
ing the teacher reach a definite conclusion as to the child’s 
mental condition, and of knowing positively if there is a phy- 
sical defect that is the real cause of what appears on the sur- 
face to be a mental defect. Still another purpose of the exam- 
ination may be for the segregation and care of crippled chil- 
dren. 
In preparing this paper I am not unmindful of the fact 
that there are many who insist that no physical examination 
should ever be made unless there are symptoms to which the 
patient himself calls attention. That such a position is unten- 
able I shall try to show later. There are still others—and their 
number is increasing at the present time, I am sorry to say— 
who go still further and say that no examination should be 
made at any time, and who say, even when the disease is de- 
stroying life itself that there is no such thing as disease, and 
that those who teach that there is, teach error. It is a ques- 
tion in my mind whether this latter class is deserving of our 
pity or our censure, but I believe that one illustration will serve 
to show their inconsistency. 
Suppose a man of this persuasion has a son twelve years 
of age. This son is attacked by a vicious dog and immediately 
ealls his father for help. The father comes and sees the pre- 
dicament of his son. Does he begin to argue with the son and 
tell him that there can’t be anything wrong, and that somebody 
has been teaching him error? No, he picks up the first thing 
that he can lay his hands on and drives the vicious brute away. 
Suppose the son again gets into trouble. This time he is at- 
tacked by a swarm of bees and his life is being threatened by 
the numerous stings inflicted upon him. In his pain and fright 
he calls to his father for help. His father comes, and what 
does he do? Does he tell the son that there is no such thing as 
pain and injury and that he must not allow himself to be so 
misled. I think that he does not, and you agree with me. He
-P-A-G-E-212
    212 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
immediately tries to free his son, even at the risk of being 
severely punished himself. And again a third affliction befalls 
the boy. This time his head and body become infected with 
vermin. The school nurse discovers the fact and the father is 
notified. Now don’t you imagine that when the father comes 
home at night and receives the school nurse’s notice you can 
hear him say something like the following: Wife, you know 
this can’t be. You know that there is no such thing as physical 
affliction—physical disease, and you know that there is no such 
thing as lice to cause them. Wife, you know that Johnnie can’t 
be lousy. No, you don’t hear anything of the kind. You could, 
if you were in hearing distance, hear something about like the 
following: Wife, I am ashamed of this; I am humiliated. Let 
us get this boy cleaned up as quietly and quickly as possible, 
and get him back to school and never let this disgraceful con- 
dition occur again. 
It would seem that the afflictions already mentioned are 
enough for any twelve-year-old boy, but they are not the only 
ones he is to suffer. This time the innocent child is attacked 
by an unsuspected diphtheria bacillus, something more deadly 
than anything yet mentioned. The school medical inspector 
discovers the condition and notifies the parents. Nothing is 
done; the child grows worse. His eyes become glazed, his skin 
changes its color, and he becomes listless. His every appear- 
ance is that of a sick boy, but nothing is done. His heart be- 
comes weaker because of the toxines it has absorbed from the 
site of the infection; his breathing becomes more labored be- 
cause of the membranes that are formed in his throat. He 
grows worse; he struggles, he gasps, he dies. During all this 
trying ordeal his ignorant and bigoted parents sit by and argue 
that Johnnie cannot be sick; that there is no such thing as dis- 
ease; that pathogenic germs are only the creation of the im- 
postor’s imagination, and that those who teach otherwise teach 
error. But all their cruel folly will not bring back to its house 
of clay the spirit of that innocent boy, for that spirit has gone 
forever. 
We pass now from that class which denies the existence 
of disease to that class which admits the existence of such, but 
says it will be time for us to give our attention to it when it 
forces itself upon our attention. These people are honestly of 
the opinion that if the diseased condition is serious enough to
-P-A-G-E-213
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 213 
need attention, it will manifest itself, and that if it does not 
bring itself to the notice of the afflicted one, ignorance is bliss, 
and hence it is folly to be wise. Only a few words should be 
required to show the fallacy of this position. Nearly all chronic 
diseases are often far advanced before the afflicted one suspects 
their presence. Tuberculosis, Bright’s disease, diabetes, the 
various forms of heart disease, and even cancer itself, which 
to the lay mind is always attended with intense suffering, are 
all often far advanced before their presence is suspected. And 
what is true of the chronic diseases is often true of the acute 
ones. Defects of vision and hearing more often than otherwise 
exist without any accompanying symptoms that call the per- 
son’s attention directly to them. If errors of refraction re- 
duce a child’s vision to half what it should be, it is just as un- 
reasonable for us to expect him to tell us about that as it would 
be for us to expect the half-witted child to come up and tell us 
about his affliction and give that as a reason for his slow prog- 
ress in school. 
The child whose hearing is reduced by adenoids does not 
know it, and if he did know that his hearing was reduced, he 
would not know why, and doubtless would have to content him- 
self with the statement from his parents that he had inherited 
the trouble, and thus be compelled to go on till he is beyond 
relief. Thus the argument might be carried on at some length, 
but this seems to suffice. The need for medical work for school 
children seems evident. What is true of the school child is 
. true just as much or more of the child in the factory; and what 
is true of the child in the factory is true of the adult in the 
factory, and so on. 
Then to summarize briefly, it is just as reasonable, just 
as right, and just as necessary for the State to look after the 
physical wellbeing of its subjects as it is for the State to look 
after the mental wellbeing of its subjects. In looking after the 
good of the one, it is looking after the good of the other. In 
looking after the physical welfare, no age is to be neglected, 
though generally speaking, effort is to be made in that direction 
that will net the greatest result. For a long time the public 
school can serve as the chief agency for the greater part of the 
work, not because the school needs it more—for as a matter of 
fact it needs it less than other departments of life in which 
mankind, old and young, is engaged—but because it furnishes 
   
-P-A-G-E-214
  214 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
the machinery necessary for immediate use. Other reasons are 
secondary. In the actual work attention must be directed along 
three lines: First, to the actual development of the body with- 
out regard to the fact that it may ever be diseased or endan- 
gered; second, to protecting the individual from surrounding 
dangers; and third, to endeavor to relieve him of the physical 
ailments with which he is already afflicted. When this is done, 
and not until then, the State will produce the best manhood 
possible and with it the best mentality. 
DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
PRESIDENT—DR. T. W. PALMER, Montevallo, Ala. 
SECRETARY—MIss M. CATHERINE CHRISTIAN, Lexington, Ky. 
The Department of Industrial Education met at 2:30 P. M., 
October 31st, 1913, in one of the classrooms in the Hume-Fogg 
High School, Nashville, Tenn., with President T. W. Palmer, 
presiding. The following program, as previously announced, 
was carried out in full: 
1. The Importance of Industrial Education to the South—Hon. 
Watt J. Brown, President Board of Trustees of School of 
Trades and Industries, Ragland, Ala. 
Discussion. 
2. Home Economics in the College Curriculum—Miss Stella 
Palmer, Teacher of Domestic Science, State College for 
Women, Tallahassee, Fla. 
Discussion. 
3. University Training in Home Economics and Its Relation to 
the Health of the Family—Miss Mary E. Sweeney, Head of 
the Home Economics Department, Kentucky State Uni- 
versity, Lexington, Ky. 
Discussion. 
There was a large attendance at the meeting and great en- 
thusiasm in the general discussion which was participated in 
by nearly all present. Among those noted were Professor Rob- 
ert W. Selvidge, Professor of Industrial Education, George Pea- 
body College, Nashville; Professor James R. Guy, Vocational 
Director, Charleston Public Schools, Charleston, S. C.; Dr. James 
H. Dillard, Director of the Jeanes and Slater Funds, New Orleans, 
La.; Mr. Miller, Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C.;

Dr. H. L. Whitfield, President Mississippi Industrial Institute 
and College, Columbus, Miss. 
Dr. Whitfield’s defense of the cultural value of Industrial 
Education so pleased his hearers that a motion to have Dr. Whit- 
field reduce his remarks to writing carried, and they appear 
among the other papers presented at this meeting. 
The election of officers for 1914 resulted in the choice of 
Professor Robert W. Selvidge, Professor of Industrial Educa- 
tion, George Peabody College for Teachers, Nashville, Tenn., 
President; Miss Stella Palmer, Teacher Domestic Science, State 
College for Women, Tallahassee, Fla., Secretary. 
The meeting adjourned about 4:30 o’clock, but many lingered 
and discussed informally their particular problems. 
It was the sense of those present that the meeting was most 
profitable with a bright outlook for the future of Industrial Edu- 
cation. M. KATHERINE CHRISTIAN,

THE IMPORTANCE OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION TO 
THE SOUTH. 
HON. WATT T. BROWN. 
There is no corresponding region in the world, which has so 
many natural advantages as the South. Every element for suc- 
cess exists here—in climate, cheap raw materials in abundance, 
cotton, timber, iron, etc., besides good markets at our very doors. 
In the wealth of these materials, the South holds the key which 
will open the door of opportunity and wealth, and which will 
add marvelously to its commerce, manufactures, agriculture and 
its domination in the business world. 
The South has long stood in the unfortunate position of a 
producer of raw materials, mainly, and while it is, of course, 
necessary and desirable to develop natural resources and pro- 
duce raw materials, we must not stop there, but keep the first 
products within our borders and manufacture them into finished 
products at home, if we would receive the full benefits of the 
development of our resources. There are a multitude of lines 
of finished products which could be manufactured to advantage 
in the South, some of which we will enumerate, 
For instance, a ton of iron ore when converted into stoves, 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
216 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
will have a value of $40.00, and will have furnished occupation 
to ten men. If, however, it is shipped away as ore, it will have 
brought a return of only $2.00, and will have furnished less than 
one day’s occupation for one man. Besides, the ore when once 
taken out, is gone forever and can never be replaced, and the 
country is further the loser, by the double freight which it pays, 
on the ore shipped out, and the stoves brought in. 
Let us take for example, cotton at ten cents per pound, and 
ship away ten million bales, which would bring us $500,000,- 
000.00, then, on the other hand, if we should keep this ten mil- 
lion bales, and manufacture it here, we would then receive thirty 
cents per pound (which is a conservative estimate) and from 
which we would realize $1,500,000,000.00, thereby saving $1,- 
000,000,000.00. This enormous sum would be shared by the 
farmers, factories, industrial workers, and all other classes of 
people, besides. increasing land values. That which is true of 
iron and cotton, is true, also, of all our other resources. 
Then let our shipments of finished products be away from, 
not toward, the South, but in order to do this we must have 
trained and skilled workers. We need, and must have industrial 
education to meet industrial opportunities. The South has been 
sadly lacking in this class of education, and its marvelous growth 
and development makes it imperative that we have industrial 
training if our people would receive the full benefits derived 
from the development of our beloved Southland. We must teach 
and train along industrial lines in order that we may be prepared 
to take advantage of the great development now in progress. 
The opening of the Panama Canal should be the means of 
attracting millions of dollars to the South, for investment for 
manufacturing at points accessible to the canal, and if we will 
seize our opportunities promptly, we will soon see an enormous 
increase of industrial activity in Southern seaports, as well as 
our interior cities, which have special advantages for manu- 
facturing. The canal will also be a great stimulant to industrial 
development because of the fact that it will put us into quick 
communication, by water, with all other parts of the world and 
the possibility of cheaper freight rates, together with the abund- 
ance of our raw materials, will naturally draw many industries. 
For successful manufacturing there are three necessary con- 
ditions: location, capital, and skilled labor. As to location, our 
conditions are ideal, for we are abundantly blessed in the raw
-P-A-G-E-217
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 217 
materials and with a splendid climate, and as to capital, this will 
naturally come when we have trained our people in that skillful 
way, but as to skilled and trained labor, we are sadly lacking. 
This latter condition, however, can soon be remedied, if we will 
teach and train our people more along industrial lines. Today 
we are having to send away to get men to head some of our 
most important industries, and to fill places to which the highest 
salaries are attached, because of a lack of sufficient skilled labor 
at home. 
Without trained workers, our advantages will avail us little 
and our resources will remain practically unproductive, unless 
taken advantage of by others. If the South is to have an un- 
checked development of her resources, she must have efficient 
human labor supplied in adequate quantities, and her most 
urgent and crying need, today, is for more trained and skilled 
workers. 
If we would succeed along life’s highway and be prosperous, 
we should study and train for that we love best to do, and that 
we can do best, and if this plan is pursued, we will not fall far 
short in our undertakings. 
One of the cardinal American doctrines is to give an equality 
of opportunity and chance of development to all its people, re- 
gardless of what their station in life might be, and it is not equal- 
ity of opportunity to spend large sums of monew on that which 
leads nowhere and aims at nothing definite. We need schools 
which are linked more closely to life, and which teach, in a skill- 
ful way, the common sense and practical things of life. Better 
results can be obtained from special training, perhaps, in special 
schools. 
Technical schools are becoming more and more the favorites 
of those seeking education, and all schools where special training 
is being given, are crowded, therefore we should realize the neces- 
sity and importance of such schools, and support them. Both 
state and county should help to maintain them. No state can 
better invest its money, than in helping to develop manly and 
womanly characters of its citizens, preparing them to think and 
act for themselves and to better meet the responsibilities of life, 
and at the same time help to develop its own resources. 
If the national government would give national aid to in- 
dustrial education, together with the state, which I feel sure 
* they will do, at some early day, it would be the wisest investment 
 
-P-A-G-E-218

that could be made. Money spent in this way should not be 
regarded as an expense, but an investment—an absolutely nec- 
essary investment if we would raise the standard of our citizen- 
ship. The present tariff bill carries an income tax, where mil- 
lions of dollars will flow into the United States treasury. If a 
certain amount of this tax was set aside, annually, for indus- 
trial education, we could hardly imagine the good it would ac- 
complish, and would come back in wealth many folds. Along 
this line, is one of the greatest works that our United States 
senators and congressmen could do for the masses of the people. 
It is significant that the United States Navy has ordered 
floating schools on its vessels. This not only shows that the 
government recognizes the importance of technical training, 
but it shows that it will offer special inducements to parents 
to allow their boys to enter the navy. Outside of their educa- 
tion and a sea voyage, they will return home equipped with 
some skillful trade by which they are better prepared to fight 
life’s battles. 
It seems that all classes of industries have received a greater 
impetus, from intelligent thought, than agriculture. Agri- 
culture has been largely passed by, and too widely the idea has 
prevailed, that all a man has to do to become a farmer, is to 
scratch the ground a little, throw some seed into it, plow once 
in a while, and trust the Lord to do the rest. This old idea has 
become obsolete, and we are beginning to realize that to be- 
come a successful farmer, we must have special training in 
scientific methods. We must teach the rising generation of 
farmers methods whereby the depletion of our soils may be 
checked, as well as the most scientific methods of agriculture, 
if we would keep abreast of our modern commercial and indus- 
trial life. 
The farmers need that quickening, vitalizing business 
touch, which will not only help them to grow their products, 
but which will teach them how to market to the best advantage. 
The most productive thing is practical intelligence properly 
applied, and this must be done in agriculture as well as any- 
thing else. When our farmers are scientifically trained in agri- 
culture, and they are able to grow twice the amount of produce 
with the same amount of labor, than formerly under the old 
methods, thereby lessening their burdens, increasing the value 
of their lands, and their own earning power, which would en-
-P-A-G-E-219
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 219 
able them to better educate their children and give them more 
of the comforts of life, and at the same time would make farm 
life more attractive and would teach the boys and girls to re- 
main on the farms instead of going away from them. 
The farm and shop are so closely allied, that whatever 
training benefits one should benefit the other, and each should 
have special :training along his special line of work. The 
farmer must have a market for his surplus, if he is to be pros- 
perous, and the nearer the market, the better prices he is able 
to command and the more valuable his farm lands become. 
There can be no prosperity, until there is something over and 
above necessity, so prosperity begins where necessity ends. The 
man in the shop must be skilled in his labor, in order that his 
earning power may be greater and he be better prepared to 
buy the products of the farm, and have a surplus left, if he, 
too, would become prosperous and educate his children. Our 
rural mail routes, parcel post, and the building of good roads, 
is making of the two classes closer neighbors day by day. 
The United States Government is becoming very much ex- 
orcised over the conservation of its resources, and both state 
and counties are very much interested in the building of good 
roads and the stopping of the waste of money, which is all good 
work, but a still greater work would be the saving of the waste 
of the human energy of our young manhood. If these energies 
were all skilled and put to work in the proper channel, what a 
vast amount of good could be accomplished. 
We need to teach more along the lines where the head and 
hand codperate. Take for example the unskilled worker, whose 
earning power is $1.25 per day, or $325.00 per year; he can not 
educate his children and give them the proper comforts of life, 
nor can he compete with the skilled laborer, whose head and 
hand have been trained to codperate, and whose earning power 
is $4.00 per day, or $875.00 more than the unskilled man. This 
vast difference enables the skilled worker to better educate his 
children and give to his family more of the comforts of life. 
The business world of today is looking for boys and girls 
who have prepared themselves to do special work, and is not 
asking what they know but what they can do. Only recently, 
the head of one of our great railroads made a public statement, 
in which he said, if all the railroads of the United States had 
skilled and trained employees, they would save a million dol- 
   
-P-A-G-E-220
   
   220 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
lars, daily, to say nothing of the saving of many lives. Think 
what would be possible by spending this vast sum, daily, in the 
building of railroads and adding to their betterments. 
Railroads, as well as other corporations, are trying, through 
necessity, to teach and train their employees. The training 
should be taken up separate and apart and the employees should 
train in that broad way which is best for their own interests 
that they would be in a better position to select occupations 
especially suited to their own talents, and it would be better for 
the corporations, also, as they, then, could select those workers 
best suited to their service. 
Industrial education is one class of education on which all 
can, and do, agree, capital and labor going hand in hand. Many 
of our greatest minds and educators of the day are turning 
more and more to this class of education. 
When our people have been thoroughly taught in industrial 
pursuits, and our system of public roads has been perfected, 
which will naturally bring better school and church houses, 
then will prosperity and happiness reign supreme in the South. 
HOME ECONOMICS IN THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM. 
MISS STELLA PALMER, TALLAHASSEE, FLA. 
The subject is one that is discussed often, but usually from 
such different standpoints that it hardly seems possible to carry 
over suggestions from one locality to another. Yet some stand- 
ards should be reached if we hope to hold our place in the front 
ranks of college subjects. The general conditions are the same 
all over the South so here is a possibility of reaching some con- 
clusions. I, of course, am not trying to settle the problem, but 
wish to raise one question for discussion and tell you how we 
answer it at the Florida State College for Women. 
What should a girl know when she has finished college 
having taken Home Economics as her major? 
We think she should understand all the principles under- 
lying cooking and be able to prepare, without any loss of time 
or energy, a meal which is well balanced and suited to the 
group of people she serves, not only from the dietetic, but also 
the economic standpoint. Also she should be able to serve this 
meal in a simple, attractive manner that would add to its pala-    
-P-A-G-E-221
     JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 221 
tability. Besides this, she should have some information con- 
cerning the general foods, how and the conditions under which 
they are produced and the laws governing their production. 
We also expect the girl to know the composition of most usual 
foods, their effect on digestion, in order that she might know 
how to feed not only the normal adult but also the infant, the 
aged and the sick. All kinds of diets should be studied for the 
fuel, nutrative and economic values. She should also know how 
to manage her house, understanding the sanitation, the con- 
struction and the artistic value of planning and decoration. 
The girl should know how to plan and make her own 
clothes, how to select materials, by having a fair amount of in- 
formation concerning the textile industries and their adultera- 
tion; how to combine those materials in order that her clothes 
might be suitable for her station in life. She should know not 
only how to select and make her own clothes, but also how to 
select and make those furnishings for the home that come under 
her control. From a general standpoint she should be well 
grounded in composition and literature, have a fair knowl- 
edge of history, the social and educational tendencies of the 
age and also be well grounded in some modern language, and 
know the rudiments of science. We think also she should know 
something of business methods and how to keep accounts. 
These may seem trivial but those of you who know girls, know 
that the majority of them are absolutely ignorant along these 
lines, and it is so necessary that they have this ability. In this 
day when women are thrown more and more on their own re- 
sources they should be prepared to take care of their own bus- 
iness. Also business responsibility is being placed on women 
from the outside, so the college woman at least should be capable 
ef coping with it. 
In so far as we are able we are trying to work out this 
problem at the Florida State College for Women. In order to 
explain our plan I find it necessary to outline the situation in 
the State. In Florida there are two State institutions, one for 
the boys, the University of Florida, and one for the girls, the 
College for Women. They are under the same management and 
have the same standards. All the work for the men is concen- 
trated at the University, while all the work for women is at our 
College. We require sixteen units for entrance. A student 
may enter with two units conditional to be worked off during   
  
-P-A-G-E-222
  222 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
her Freshman year. For graduation she must complete sixty 
hours work ‘in the four years, taking not less than fifteen hours 
nor more than eighteen hours a year (two hours laboratory 
work is counted as one hour credit.) 
The student majoring in Home Economics receives at the 
end of four years’ work a B. S. degree, during that time she 
spends fifteen per cent. of her time in purely technical courses. 
The courses we offer are as follows: Freshman Year, Ele- 
mentary Cooking, Food Production and Manufacture, 2 hours 
credit. Elementary Sewing and Garment Making, 2 hours 
credit; Textiles 1 hour credit. With these subjects the student 
is required to take 3 hours English, 3 hours History, 3 hours 
Modern Language, 3 hours Chemistry. 
Sophomore Year: Experimental Cookery and Table Ser- 
vice 2 hours, Elementary Dressmaking 2 hours credit, Design 
1 hour credit—with these 3 hours English, 3 hours Modern 
Language, 3 hours Chemistry, 3 hours Mathematics. 
Junior and Senior Years: Dietetics and Household Man- 
agement 3 hours credit, Millinery and Advanced Dressmaking 
2 hours credit, with these 3 hours Psychology, 1 hour Educa- 
tion. This leaves 21 hours of electives for the two years which 
are subject to the approval of the teacher who is appointed as 
advisor of the student. We offer a course in methods of teach- 
ing Home Economics with practical teaching in the County 
High School. Those students who wish to teach are advised to 
elect this course. 
We have had much discussion about giving college credit 
for elementary cooking and sewing, but so far we have found 
this unnecessary as very few high schools in Florida teach these 
subjects. Since the students have no preparation and yet wish 
to take the subject we are forced to give elementary work and 
give them credit for it. We are trying gradually to force out 
these subjects as we give to those students who have had two 
years high school work of three double periods a week, credit 
for the first year Home Economic work. Of the new students 
who entered school this year only one-fifth were given advanced 
standing. This is a considerable increase over last year. Pres- 
ent indications point to a still greater increase next year. 
When we have the High Schools brought up to standard 
then we can strengthen our advanced work to carry out more 
nearly the ideals we hold.

UNIVERSITY TRAINING IN HOME ECONOMICS AND 
ITS RELATION TO THE HEALTH OF THE FAMILY. 
MISS MARY E. SWEENY, LEXINGTON, KY. 
The educational system of the United States was born in 
a Puritan environment and of the formal and disciplinary type, 
from the Monastic era of education it inherited its Latin and 
Greek and in its own age established literature as the founda- 
tion of a genuine life training. The surroundings from which 
it came were rural and agricultural, town and country differed 
little in their isolation; the only schools that existed were semi- 
private or religious, there was no interest in general education 
and such college training as was offered was for the ministry 
alone. 
The home was a workshop as well as a dwelling, clothing, 
shoes, preserved foods, smoked meats, lard, soap, candles and 
furniture were made there. The child was educated in the 
school of experience, which developed his judgment, initiative 
and the skill which comes in the doing of things with the fingers. 
The conditions of life while tense, were static, the apprentice 
system was everywhere in vogue, and the actual doing of work 
was the child’s means of education; the home was also the cen- 
ter of religious training and moral discipline. 
Since earlier times an increasing population has massed 
itself in the cities, manufacturing centers have developed, rail- 
roads have been built, the West has opened up, communication 
has become easier and rapid, the introduction of steam, elec- 
tricity and machinery has changed the aspect of industry, man’s 
capacity for work has increased and greater efficiency de- 
manded. Manners, customs, religious observations, political 
ideas and views of life as well as ways of living were equally 
transformed. 
With these marked social and industrial changes the old 
method of instruction in the home, the only educational sys- 
tem of the times, broke down. The ability to read, write and 
cipher no longer distinguished the educated from the unedu- 
eated man and a better knowledge of broader and of different 
kind from that suitable for static conditions was necessary to 
meet the changed character of national and private life. The 
home was no longer a workshop; its industry had shifted to the 
    
-P-A-G-E-224
  224 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
factory, its educational function to the school, the population 
was less homogenous, the mode of life was different, the social 
customs and traditions which had exercised so strong an edu- 
cative and religious influence were conspicuously weakened. 
By the close of the nineteenth century the industrial spirit 
had become a mighty factor in education. Newer systems of 
education shifted the emphasis from the mere attainment of 
eulture to the men being trained, from method to character 
building. Froebel gave expression to the need of this spirit in 
the child’s training and Herbert focused the world’s educational 
thought on education as a science and as the development of a 
many-sided interest. The influence of these men together with 
the pressure upon the schools exerted by practical men from 
without caused, in a large measure, the introduction of the 
courses of applied art and science into the curriculum, including 
manual training, laboratory instruction, introduction of the 
kindergarten, music, drawing, nature study and elementary 
work in domestic science and marked an epoch when the knowl- 
edge of the classics was no longer the only measuring unit for 
educational standards. 
During these periods of great national and industrial ex- 
pansion, of social progress and educational readjustment, 
slowly, steadily, imperceptibly the home had ceased to be a posi- 
tive, determining factor in either national or community life, 
with its influence as an individual center of learning dissipated, 
its religious and moral responsibility transfered to the church 
there is, as Dr. Albion Small expresses it, “nothing left to it 
but cooking and cleaning,” and yet on these two functions the 
health and maintenance of the race depend. 
It is an indictment of the twentieth century that the home 
has been so traditional and conservative in its policies that it 
has come to serve as a sort of a shrine, a thing apart from so- 
ciety, and end in itself, rather than a unit cell in the great social 
battery which drives civilization forward. 
Yet the world’s business is home-making, the school, the 
national government, the church, all industry and commerce are 
but contributory agents to the developing and maintaining of 
this primary necessity of every racial life, the home, and to 
the making of men and women who are to be powerful factors 
in uplifting society. 
The conception of the home as an efficient, responsible in-
-P-A-G-E-225
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 225 
strument of society is just beginning to filter through into the 
public mind and the understanding of the school, whether ele- 
mentary, secondary, high school or university as an institutional 
medium in which the individual must be prepared for a useful 
place in the real activities of the world and the means by which 
society can give to the individual those opportunities of body 
and mind which shall render him a healthy, intelligent, useful 
citizen. 
Society has inherited no more pernicious and disastrous 
legacy from the past than the belief that the making of a home, 
the health of the family, the building of a nation’s character 
could be trusted to untrained instinct, romantic inspiration and 
moral sentiment. As a result of adherence to this traditional 
belief there has been lamentable inefficiency in the administra- 
tion of the affairs of the home, great waste of life and money, 
time’ and energy and food material. 
The statistics of 1900 alone bear testimony to this state- 
ment in the fact that in this country during that year approxi- 
mately 250,000 babies died, it is estimated that two-thirds of 
this mortality was preventable and 60,000 were victims of 
enteritis and all obtainable evidence points to but one cause, 
that of dirty and sour milk. 109,000 persons pay yearly tribute 
to the tubercular breeding power of contaminated dust, and 
35,000 die annually of typhoid fever contracted by drinking 
polluted water. 
Such a preventable loss of human life demands a training 
for the home-maker not only for the home’s sake, but for the 
nation’s sake to check so inexcusable a waste. 
Woman’s task as a home-maker is no less arduous than in 
the days of her grandmother; there are the same primal neces- 
sities to be provided, but she must approach her problem in a 
different way and use new and improved methods for accom- 
plishing her task; she must follow her tools into the factory, 
the mill and the mine and see that they are used wisely and 
well. The fact must be faced that the industries of the home 
as such are doomed and that at its present status it is dependent 
upon public utilities; that woman must follow her household 
responsibilities to their long range, whether it be to the bakery 
where her bread and pastry are made, to the laundry which 
washes her linens, or to the sweat-shop which tailors her ready- 
made clothing. When domestic life was less complex the house- 
15 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
  226 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
wife could control the sanitation and hygiene of her own plant, 
the adulterations of her own food supply, but today she is de- 
pendent upon a host of agents and she must therefore be trained 
in her relation to the government because it is her adviser as 
well as public carrier, to business because she is an economical 
factor, to capital and labor because they are her servants, to 
problems of health because on them depend her own mainten- 
ance and efficiency and that of the community; in short she 
must be trained to function as an intelligent consumer and as 
a directing agent in life. 
When woman as a class recognizes how intimately and in- 
_ tricately interwoven the function of food is with the physical 
well-being, the mental and moral deficiencies and the social 
inequalities of men they will realize that the profession of 
parenthood and home-maker calls for concise, systematic sci- 
entific knowledge and for a many-sided training. 
To insure the health of the family more than a supeficial 
knowledge of the composition of food is necessary, it requires 
an understanding of their chemical combination, the demands 
of the body cells for maintenance and growth, the chemical 
changes brought about in cooking, rational quantities of ma- 
terial to be fed and the most desirable combinations. Investi- 
gators have already proven that rheumatism, gout, Bright’s 
disease and other allied ills find their largest number of vic- 
tims among the overfed and the determining factor in the cause 
of these maladies is the kind and quantity of food offered on 
.the family table. Do not understand me as saying that a family 
cannot be healthy in the absence of such training, but I do say 
that it can not be done without a waste of food material with- 
out economic loss and an unnecessary expenditure of energy 
and without the guarantee of having given to the body its re- 
quirement in nourishment and mineral salts. Who is there to 
say that while health may be maintained and growth takes place 
that many of the ills of life, are not the full fruition of the evils 
of irrational eating, overfeeding and malnutrition. Science is 
asserting that the marked increase in deaths caused by apo- 
plexy, heart disease, brain disorders, and premature old age 
are in large part due to the dietetic sins of the individual. 
The correlation in a university course of the subject of 
food to work in chemistry, botany, physiology and cooking, the 
relation of nutrition to the necessary training in quantitative
-P-A-G-E-227
        JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 227 
analysis, anatomy, biology, food manufacture, and practical 
dietetics, the reinforcement of physiological chemistry with 
advanced physiology, food analysis and microbiology requires 
the great underlying purpose and idea of rendering to the 
commonwealth which supports the university the greatest of 
all benefits, healthy, efficient homes. 
It is obviously true that the care of food in the home, 
proper sanitary measures to insure its protection while upon 
the market and in transportation directly influence the ratio 
of health in the family, these lines of investigation correctly 
paralleled with bacteriology, entomology and chemistry should 
be offered as a vital part of the training in Home Economics. 
Scientific courses should deal with the problem of house- 
hold sanitation and offer systematic study of community health 
upon the individual, effect of bad housing upon the usefulness 
of the wage-earner; what constitutes proper location, ventila- 
tion, lighting and heating of a dwelling, the safety of its water 
supply, proper disposal of household waste and city sewerage, 
garbage removal and street cleaning. Instruction, based on 
the correlated sciences, should deal with the milk supply, its 
freedom from disease-producing bacilli, as a transmitter of ty- 
phoid and scarlet fevers and diphtheria, the infant mortality 
caused by dirt and filth which it may contain, the economic 
loss to the community and the nation in the illness and death 
produced thereby. The sanitation of bakeries, abattoirs and 
public markets should be investigated if the woman is to meas- 
ure to her full responsibility in maintaining the health of the 
family. 
The study of personal hygiene leads naturally to family 
health and community hygiene and while the home-maker is 
being trained to care for her own body and that of her indi- 
vidual group she is acquiring the sanest kind of sociological, 
industrial and civic knowledge. Into her mind there is being 
woven intimate acquaintance with the problems of labor, con- 
ditions in the sweat shops, the inter-relation of the health of 
the over-worked, under-fed wage-earner and public hygiene. 
To the tools with which she must work there should be given 
an ethical and cultural significance and home-making should 
be made of professional rank and the care of its health, a fine 
art. 
When the universities of this country can send out their
-P-A-G-E-228
  228 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
women with a cultural and professional education, sociologically 
and scientifically equipped to preside over a home which will 
render to the state and society the product which the state and 
society have the right to demand happy, healthy, useful citizens 
and homes which are not only tools for higher efficiency, but 
which can assume the duty and responsibility of answering to 
generations yet unborn for their health, their success and their 
service to humanity. 
The needs of the times are imperative; capital has changed 
from a national to an international basis; trusts, combinations 
and associations have been formed in every line of business, 
new inventions have replaced old trades, living conditions have 
become increasingly complex and therefore potentially more 
dangerous, and the home horizon has been made cosmopolitan. 
The highest product of social evolution is the home which only 
a wise, high-minded woman can make and preside over. The 
university’s highest duty to the women of every state is to 
develop the great social and moral power which lies in their 
keeping. For in the last analysis it is not forms of government 
which make or unmake men, but the character of their wives 
and mothers and of their homes. 
And I dare to assert that the training of women for home- 
making means more to the future than all the planned legisla- 
tive, commercial and economical reforms. Its influence does 
not stop at the home, it will mean higher standards of manhood, 
greater thoroughness of training and the coming of better men. 
DISCUSSION BY H. L. WHITFIELD, COLUMBUS, MISS. 
The subject of industrial education has not yet found its 
proper setting in our scheme of education. Because of a lack 
of scientific knowledge of this important subject in its relation 
to a general educational scheme our educational leaders are di- 
vided into two hostile groups. One group is clamoring for 
greater recognition of the industrial subjects in our school cur- 
riculum, while the other group is stubbornly fighting to pre- 
serve the sacred curriculum from the profanation of the bar- 
barians who would substitute industrial subjects for many of 
the time-honored branches of learning. The one believes, in 
its ignorance of educational philosophy, that true culture is be- 
ing jeopardized by this onslaught of ruthless barbarians of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
   JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 229 
practical subjects; the other, in its zeal to bring emancipation 
from want and needless drudgery to the toiling millions, be- 
lieves that much which has gone under the guise of culture has 
been mere pretense, and that all studies should be of a voca- 
tional character. 
In my opinion, both of these contentions are wrong. There 
should be no antagonism between studies which teach us to do 
well the necessary work of life and those subjects which give 
us the highest ideals of life and which energize us to use our 
scientific knowledge for a fuller and a richer output. To say 
that He has so organized a universe that man must spend the 
largest portion of his working time in manual labor, and that 
this necessary work is debasing to him, is to charge God of 
folly. Certainly the doing of the necessary and the useful in a 
right way does not blind man to the beauties of this world 
which God has so lavishly spread out for man’s enjoyment. 
Let both sides study these questions:—the more they learn of 
God’s plan for the perfection of man through education, the 
more will these differences vanish. I believe that God has not 
made man composed of warring elements, but that whatever is 
best for man in any part of his life is best for him in his whole 
life; if in the economy of God’s creation it is necessary for man 
to labor with his hands, such work, instead of rendering him 
less capable of receiving and appreciating the harmonies and 
beauties that surround him, attune him more sensitively to 
catch the finer impulses which would be lost if he failed to obey 
the early injunction that man should earn bread by the sweat 
of his brow! 
Industrial subjects when rightly apprehended become the 
basis of true culture. What is culture? Culture is usually de- 
fined as being that condition of soul which renders it capable 
of responding to the good, the true and the beautiful as they 
are expressed by art in any of its forms. If this be true, then 
the greatest task of educating for culture is to so manipulate 
the person to be educated that the very chords of his soul will 
be attuned to receive and to vibrate in unison with the tones 
and impulses that emanate from every true piece of art. But 
of what is a true product of art composed? The answer is 
simple, the artist is limited in his materials to the concrete 
things of life which he has cognized through his senses, or 
to those things which are referable to that concrete knowledge 
which has come through his senses. Of necessity all works of 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  230 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
art are but ideal combinations of concrete experiences. The 
finest piece of literature, the most beautiful painting, the most 
magnificent sculpture, the most splendid architecture, when re- 
duced to the elements of which they are composed, are but the 
common, concrete things of life. All true artists, before any 
process of construction is begun, exhaust the concrete field that 
limits that portion of life which they would beautifully express. 
No painter could put a leaf of any particular kind in a picture 
without studying minutely all characteristics or qualities of the 
leaves of this special variety. To paint landscapes, an artist 
must know landscapes in the concrete. The artist does have the 
peculiar power of seeing, hearing, touching with accuracy and 
facility ; but he must see, hear, and touch, before he can express 
in any form of idealized beauty. 
Only a few are artists; it is within the province of all to 
be able to interpret and enjoy the beautiful as it exists in na- 
ture, or as it has been ideally combined by the artist. But man 
is not born with the full capacity for this appreciation; he 
must be educated for its complete enjoyment. But of what does 
the education for artistic enjoyment consist? Just as the artist 
had to know the concrete elements before he could express them 
in art, so he who would get the message which art has for him, 
must learn at first hand the concrete elements of which any 
definite work of art is composed. These concrete elements con- 
stitute the alphabet of art; this alphabet must be known before 
the language in which any particular piece of art is written 
can be read. The man who knows best the things of life—those 
things, whether they be material things, persons, or the rela- 
tions of things, or persons, as cognized by the senses—is pre- 
pared to enter the holy of holies of the sanctuary of art, and 
in no other way may he hope to enter. The very work that is 
necessary to be done in the getting of our living, when well 
done, is our preparation for the learning of these higher things 
which lift us above ourselves. Of course, I am speaking of true 
art appreciation and genuine culture. I am not talking of 
those whose aim is always to impress people with their knowl- 
edge of art, who read the art criticisms and become human 
phonographs for reproducing what others have felt; noisy ex- 
plosions of commendation in the presence of art are but evidences 
of pretense and an absence of the sensitive soul, stringed and 
tuned to catch the divine afflatus which true art gives to him
-P-A-G-E-231

who has prepared himself to be a fit receiving instrument for 
it. 
A good woman, who believed that the power of apprecia- 
tion of art was inherent in the human soul, carried some little 
boys of the slums to one of America’s most wonderful art gal- 
leries. Without reference to their past experiences, she en- 
deavored to have them take an interest in several of the world’s 
masterpieces. The pictures had no meaning to the boys be- 
cause they represented scenes with which they had had no 
previous experience; they could not be coaxed to stand before 
these pictures while their friend was trying to explain the 
beauty of the pictures to them. The good woman, being dis- 
couraged, finally released the boys and let them go where fancy 
dictated; it was not long before they were circled around one 
certain picture. And why? Because this was a picture of a 
scene of sickness in the slums; they had seen the actual in this 
scene many times; they had the concrete elements—the alpha- 
bet for spelling out the meaning of the beautiful picture. 
Now, does the general study of industry give this concrete 
background? Industry deals with things and persons, and 
properties, qualities, uses, relations of persons and things. The 
students who are required to work in textiles, wood, iron, and 
who have constantly to form, place, and use materials from all 
the metals in an endless variety of shapes and relations, are 
constantly getting that knowledge of concrete things which 
constitute the elements of life and art. Nearly all of his work 
brings the student into concrete touch with the material things 
of life, as regards their origin, properties, uses, qualities, rela- 
tions, etc. Not only this, but his work brings him into contact 
with his fellow man in various relations as co-laborer, boss, 
and the many other relations that are sustained between men 
who have to work together. All social relations and attitudes, 
passions, poses, and other phases of life become his acquisi- 
tions and constitute the background against which idealized 
forms of like type may be thrown for interpretation. I do not 
refer to the study of industry that has resulted from a highly 
organized business where division of labor has decreed that the 
laborer shall do one thing only in one way all the time. I am 
talking of industry,—general industry as a feature of education. 
Education of this kind should commence in the home where 
the child should be taught to do all of those tasks which are: 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
232 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
inseparably connected with every regulated home. A child who 
does not get this large, full and rich store of concrete knowl- 
edge in his home while he is growing, has been cheated of his 
possibilities to enjoy the idealization of such things, or of all 
things that this specific concrete knowledge prepares him to 
interpret. When he leaves the home and goes to school, he 
should have the opportunity to continue the study of industry 
in a more comprehensive way. Among the many benefits that 
he gets from such training is the fact that every time he 
touches a material thing in its use he is getting experience 
which later will enable him to comprehend something of the 
beautiful in nature and art. 
Art is but the beautiful expression of life. He who will 
take our choicest specimens of literature or paintings and anal- 
yze these productions, will find that by far the larger part of 
the concrete elements of which they are composed are the very 
elements that are required by the study of industry in some of 
its forms, or in some of its relations. In agriculture,—such 
details as growing crops, harvesting grain, animals, labor, 
houses, barns, orchards, household occupations, and many other 
phase’ of farm life, have been the favorite themes of many of 
our greatest artists. All this literature and these paintings 
are filled with meaning and joy to him who has actually studied 
intelligently this life. 
Not only in the garnering of a full storehouse of rich con- 
crete elements does the study of industry prepare for art ap- 
preciation. The truth of the brotherhood of man and sympathy 
with struggling humanity are gained through the doing of the 
work that is necessary to be done for the wellbeing of the world. 
These spiritual qualities are essential to him who would get the 
meaning of life as it is written in every true art. Man must 
not only know, but he must be in the right spiritual attitude to 
the elements represented in an art if he is to enjoy and be trans- 
formed by it. 
The same is true of all industries when properly studied; 
they become the open door by which one may go into the temple 
of art, there to revel in spiritual communion with those things 
which are meaningless to him who has not learned the language 
in which the various messages are written.

Discussion :—Verd Peterson, Middle Tennessee State Nor- 
mal School, Murfreesboro, Tenn. 
The speaker took issue with Prof. Leiper as to the training 
of teachers in agriculture for high schools by normal schools, 
believing that normal schools should confine their efforts to the 
elementary schools. He was opposed to short course prepara- 
tion, believing a year inadequate for the preparation of teachers 
of agriculture, and stressed the social feature in the teaching of 
this subject. He offered as additional equipment: 
(1) A good farm, properly organized. 
(2) A model school—the real thing—perhaps not on the 
school grounds but in the community. 
(3) Other equipment, as dairy, poultry plant, and library. 
He would reorganize the course in science, leaving out much 
in physics, and have both physics and chemistry correlate with 
agriculture. In biology he would study real processes in life. 
He would make entrance possible without the necessity of a 
grinding through the mill of Latin and mathematics, would have 
extension work, would stress pedagogy, and would offer a spe- 
cial agricultural course leading to a certificate. He would hold 
pupils until their point of view had been turned in the direction 
of agriculture.

Training of Teachers for Rural Schools—Dr. J. G. Crabbe, 
President Eastern Kentucky State Normal School, Richmond, 
Ky. 
The biggest problem of normal schools is to prepare teach- 
ers for the rural schools. Rural teachers should be a product of 
the soil, should identify themselves with the country, share in 
its joys and sorrows. The country should not be supplied with 
teachers from the city, as they are not familiar with country life. 
The speaker added two other requisites: Students must study 
their own counties, and they must be men and women of vision, 
must be able to look beyond the ken of the physical and see the 
things that are to be. This latter qualification is bigger and 
more vital than any curriculum. The teacher who has not seen 
the light of the new day is not fit to teach. The speaker closed 
with an eloquent reference to the painter Millet and to the singer 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 235 
Jenny Lind, as illustrative of the kind of vision the teacher 
should have. 
The Functions of the Training School—President J. M. 
Pound, Athens, Ga. 
The speaker laid down three separate functions of the train- 
ing school: (1) To furnish object lessons in the practice of the 
principles and theory of education. For this purpose the equip- 
_ ment should be fine and the latest models used, so as to lead to 
the creation of ideals in the pupils. (2) To discover the ability 
of the student and.to correct the old practices. (3) To furnish 
an opportunity of experimentation. Students should be taught 
to take the initiative. The best ones should be put into the 
training school. New theories should be tried out here. The 
normal school is the advance guard of the educational interests 
of the state, while the training school serves in the capacity of 
scout. It is to the normal school what a laboratory is to the 
department of chemistry. 
Discussion :—Miss Sarah Luther, Troy State Normal School, 
Troy, Ala. 
The speaker believes that every teacher in a normal school 
should be a member of the training school. In too many in- 
stances each department is a separate kingdom. The teacher 
should be an exemplar of the method of his department. Ev- 
ery teacher in the normal school should have a class in the 
grades, so as to exemplify his theories, and should serve as 
critic over some division. The pupil teacher should select a 
school in the county and by letters and visits make a study of 
the physical and moral environment of that community. The 
speaker stressed the importance of vision and the wonderful 
force behind personality. The whole normal school must be a 
model of practice and each teacher an apostle. 
Hereunpon followed a most interesting discussion in round 
table of the different methods of conducting the practice school. 
Dr. Johnson stated that all pupil teachers in his school were 
required to teach in the practice school for one term of three 
months during their senior year. This teaching was done dur- 
ing the morning, while they took their classes in the afternoon. 
Dr. Kirk stated that in the Kirksville State Normal a year’s 
teaching of one or two periods in the practice school was requi- 
site to graduation, and that students were allowed to do this 
teaching as soon as they showed they had the ability to do so,
-P-A-G-E-236
  236 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
irrespective of year or previous study of psychology. Miss 
Luther stated that in the Troy State Normal the practice teach- 
ing was done by the Seniors during their vacant periods and 
that this practice teaching was under the supervision of the 
critic teachers. They taught one period a day throughout the 
session. Miss Jennie West, Superintendent of Christian County, 
Kentucky, called attention to the evils of simply preparing 
teachers for a certificate. 
HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT SHOULD AGRICULTURE 
BE TAUGHT IN NORMAL SCHOOLS? 
M. A. LEIPER, BOWLING GREEN, KY. 
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
Recent years have seen many interesting facts brought to 
light as to inefficiency in rural life, and many far-reaching plans 
of action for an alleviation of this condition have been suggested 
and urged. Many forces, either in the form of government ac- 
tivities or philanthropic endeavor, have entered the field in an 
effort to solve the problem, or at least to assist in raising the 
standards of rural life. That this may be done, it seems to me 
that there should be in each rural community one centralized 
agency, a clearing-house as it were, through which all forces 
might work in disseminating the necessary ideals and informa- 
tion, and without such an organization of effort the rural uplift 
movement must be more or less spasmodic and ineffective. 
Such an agency, in germ at least, is the state’s public school; 
and yet, the ability of this institution to perform the great task 
that this ideal would impose upon it will depend first and fore- 
most upon the preparation the teacher has had for the work. 
The teacher, then, is the key to the solution of the vexing rural 
problem, for, as Mr. H. W. Foght, specialist in rural education 
in the National Bureau of Education, says, “Without strong men 
and women professionally prepared for their work in the redi- 
rected rural schools, there can be no satisfactory adjustment of 
rural life.” 
The question whether the rural public school will take its 
proper place, or be left out entirely, in the reorganization of 
rural life, now well under way, is already being asked on every 
hand. Public opinion is fast crystallizing to the end that it 
should and must, and many states have passed laws in an at-
-P-A-G-E-237
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 237 
tempt to force it to do so; and yet neither public opinion, nor 
law, which is its normal expression, can force such a program 
upon the rural school until a teacher properly trained in the 
knowledge of agriculture and its pedagogy, and in appreciation 
of rural life problems is provided for the work. Could there be 
any question, then, as to the imperative and immediate need for 
the preparation by Normal Schools of a great body of teachers 
who will go out and demonstrate what the ideal rural school 
should be and do? 
As a general proposition, then, the Normal School should 
stimulate and foster both by inside instruction and by outside 
extension work, every educative agency looking toward the de 
velopment of rural life. Specifically speaking, it should send out 
into the rural districts a great body of teachers who are con- 
versant with rural life problems anu prepared to teach the prin- 
ciples and practices of elementary agriculture. In addition to 
this general work, it should also offer advanced and more ex- 
tensive courses in agriculture, along with considerable work in 
kindred subjects in science, to prepare a certain number of its 
graduates for schools where a teacher who is more or less a 
specialist in this work is desired. The Normal School should, 
thus, lead the way, not only in the science but also in the peda- 
gogy and practice of agriculture and home economics, in so far 
as the preparation of teachers for elementary and secondary 
rural schools is concerned. In my judgment no Normal School 
is properly performing its functions unless it seeks in this way 
to benefit every rural school and home. 
To be more specific, however, the amount of agriculture that 
should be offered in the Normal School can be determined only 
by ascertaining how much of it should and may be taught in the 
various kinds of rural schools. To this end, I shall attempt to 
outline briefly a tentative course in agriculture for public schools, 
viewed from the standpoints of (a) the one-room rural school 
and the village graded school; (b) the consolidated school and 
the rural county high school, and (c) the county agricultural 
high school. 
I take it that in the one-room school and in the village 
graded school, under their present organization and with teach- 
ers properly trained, four distinct lines of agricultural work 
may be effectively done, as follows: 
1. Text-book work in class recitation in the sixth, sev- 
   
-P-A-G-E-238
  238 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
enth, and eighth grades, to be alternated and correlated with 
reading, geography, and physiology. 
2. Experiments (a) in the school room, such as testing 
seed corn, testing soil for lime, testing how roots absorb mois- 
ture, etc., and (b) in growing plants in school or home garden, 
where the season of the year permits. 
83. In fostering agricultural club organizations, especially 
among school boys and girls, such as corn, cotton, potato, and 
canning clubs; and in being a clearing-house through which 
may pass information in the form of pamphlets and bulletins 
that have been prepared by government and state experts. 
4. Correlation in introducing instruction along agricul- 
tural line in language, geography, arithmetic, physiology, read- 
ing, etc.; or, in a word, turning the instruction in all of the 
subjects largely in the direction of farm-life activities. How 
this may be done in language, for example, has been shown in 
Bulletin 18, 1912 series, Bureau of Education, Washington, 
D. C., entitled, “Teaching Language Through Agriculture and 
Domestic Science,” by M. A. Leiper. 
The schools in the second group—the consolidated school 
and the rural county high school—should do a more advanced 
type of work in agriculture, because they usually have longer 
school terms, better equipment, and more ground for experi- 
mental work, and because they all have, or in time will have, 
teachers who are more specifically trained for this particular 
work. The four types of work outlined above for one-room 
rural schools and village graded schools should be offered in 
the schools of this group, but along broader and more intensive 
lines. A more advanced text-book should be used, experimental 
work, both in the school-room and on the school or neighboring 
farm, should be more advanced and of a more practical nature, 
and the emphasis should be placed in all phases of the work on 
the practical application of the principles learned. 
The work done in the county agricultural high schools will 
be largely what has been outlined above for the second group of 
schools. It will be more advanced, however, more extensive 
as well as intensive, and will perhaps devote much time to ex- 
tension and experimental work on farms in its immediate vicin- 
ity or county. 
The duty of the Normal School, then, is to offer such in- 
struction in its courses as will enable the teachers whom it
-P-A-G-E-239
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 239 
sends out to the rural schools to do effectively the work outlined 
above. Some of those who maintain that the Normal School 
should confine its activities to the preparation of teachers for 
the elementary school may question its duty and right to pre- 
pare teachers for agriculture for the secondary schools in 
groups “b” and “ce” above, but the necessity for it to do so will 
become increasingly imperative as time passes, because the 
forces in agricultural colleges are generally designed for 
farmers and not for teachers, and because their graduates are 
neither sufficient in number nor inclined to do service as teach- 
ers. It is quite certain, at any rate, that the demand for teach- 
ers of agriculture will be so great for a number of years that 
all of the institutions of the country cannot overstock the 
market. 
The necessity, therefore, for the proper courses in agri- 
culture in Normal School curricula is imperative and immedi- 
ate. Every future farmer that is now in our public schools 
should have a chance to study the principles of his life work 
before it is too late, and delay on the part of Normal Schools 
in sending him a teacher prepared to give him the needed in- 
struction will cheat him of his birthright, and perhaps send 
him to the city where only a mess of porridge awaits him. 
Moreover, it is no matter of a few months to send into the rural 
schools enough teachers properly prepared to leaven the whole 
lump, and haste on the part of the Normal Schools in perform- 
ing the task is, therefore, highly essential. 
In view of these facts, I wish to suggest for your considera- 
tion two courses in agriculture that I believe every Normal 
School should offer, the first to prepare teachers for schools in 
group “a” above, and the second to prepare teachers for schools 
in groups “b” and “ec.” 
The work offered for the preparation of teachers in the 
one-room and village graded schools should come early in the 
course, perhaps in the first year’s work, because students in 
the advanced classes rarely ever go back to teach in these 
schools. It should, moreover, be required of all students, or, 
at least, of those who are likely to teach in rural schools. It 
should last from thirty to forty weeks, and give instruction of 
the four following kinds: 
1. The fundamental principles of agriculture, together 
with the methods and pedagogy of the work as it applies to
-P-A-G-E-240
    240 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
rural schools. The principles will include such topics as the 
plant, the soil in relation to plant growth, preparation of soil 
for seed, seed selections, weeds, field and forage crops, live stock, 
the orchard, birds, trees, pests, etc. 
2. Practical experiments. Teachers should know from 
twenty-five to fifty experiments that may be conducted without 
difficulty in the one-room and village schools. These are such 
as testing seed corn, porosity and capillarity of soil, how plants 
absorb moisture, circulation of water in plants, ete. The 
methods of conducting experiments in school gardens should 
be taught here, along with the best plans for fostering agri- 
cultural clubs among the boys and girls. 
8. Careful instruction in the principles of correlation as 
it applies to the subjects in the rural school curriculum. Teach- 
ers should understand how to turn language, arithmetic, geog- 
raphy, physiology, reading, etc., in the direction of farm-life 
“ activities. Special emphasis should be placed on this phase of 
the work. 
4. Instruction as to the source of supply, use, and selec- 
tion of books of reference, supplementary readers, and farm- 
ers’ bulletins. Every rural school should have a good working 
library containing, among other things, material of this type. 
To prepare teachers who are more or less specialists in 
agriculture for the schools in groups “b” and “ce” above, a sec- 
ond course should be offered. In addition to all of the work 
outlined in the first course above, at least one year’s work in 
advanced agriculture, with practical application of all princi- 
ples learned on the school farm, should be required in this 
course. A strong background of science should be given 
through thorough courses in biology, zoology, chemistry, phy- 
sics, physical geography, manual arts, etc. Students in this 
course should be required to do practice teaching in regular 
classes in agriculture in the Training School, or in the Model 
Rural School, which every Normal School should have. In 
view of the demand in the matter of general scholarship that 
this course should make, it should require as much time for 
completion as the regular courses leading to a life certificate, 
and should carry with it all of the privileges and honors of such 
a certificate. 
To do the work of these two courses a Normal School must 
have certain equipment and a strong faculty in its science de-
-P-A-G-E-241
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 241 
partment. At the head of its agricultural work should be a 
man of scholarship in this and kindred subjects and one of ex- 
perience in practical farm activities. He should be well-versed 
in the rural conditions of the state in which he is working and 
in the pedagogical side of agricultural work in rural schools. 
In the second place, it is coming to be a generally accepted 
truth that every Normal School should have an experimental 
farm of from fifty to one hundred acres. On this farm students 
may observe actual farming done in a scientific way, and may 
personally take care of a small plot in trying out certain prac- 
tical ideas that may be utilized in the school or home garden 
connected with the rural school. Incidentally, anything that 
may be an object lesson in ideal farming, which may be carried 
back to the rural districts should be given a place on this farm. 
Again, the Normal School should have well-equipped chem- 
ical, physical, biological, and manual arts laboratories. In con- 
nection with some of these, perhaps the biological and chemical, 
there should also be an agricultural laboratory, in which may 
be found various kinds of apparatus, such as a Babcock milk 
tester, a seed grader, a seed tester, etc. Here could be conducted 
many practical tests and experiments mentioned in the courses 
outlined above. Another laboratory of another kind, which is 
essential in the equipment of the ideal Normal School, is the 
Model Rural School, in which agricultural work, such as has 
been suggested for rural schools, may be offered for the observa- 
tion and practice teaching of student teachers. 
In conclusion, I do not believe I have offered too ideal a 
program for the agricultural work of Normal Schools, for quite 
a few of them have approximately reached this standard al- 
ready. Normal Schools, equipped as indicated in this program 
and offering the courses suggested above, are certainly the only 
ones that are prepared to assist effectively in the solution of the 
vexing rural school problem, for the country school will never 
reach the position of efficiency that it should occupy until a 
teacher trained by such a program is sent to it. 
Normal Schools have, I believe, just begun to realize and to 
perform their great obligation to the rural school. And in the 
performance of this obligation other and wider spheres of use- 
fulness are quite sure to open up before them. “There is no 
reason, for example, why every Normal School should not do a 
certain amount of extension work, thus carrying the benefits of  
-P-A-G-E-242
    242 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
the institution to the borders of its field of patronage,” says Mr. 
O. H. Benson, of the Government Bureau of Agriculture. I hope 
and believe that the time will also come when every Normal 
School will encourage and promote boys’ and girls’ club work 
through the rural schools with a view to getting the elements of 
agriculture into actual practice upon the farms and in the home. 
We are face to face even now with the problem of furnishing ex- 
tension workers, whose business it will be to help the rural and 
village teachers install and handle properly the subjects of ele- 
mentary agriculture and home economics in schools where teach- 
ers are not trained for the work and where it is not possible to 
employ special teachers in these subjects. With this broad ideal 
of what a Normal School should do in operation it may then be 
said of it that it has genuinely found its mission with regard to 
rural life and its problems. 
THE NEED OF A BROADER EDUCATION FOR NORMAL 
STUDENTS. 
JAMES ELLIOTT WALMSLEY, ROCK HILL, S. C. 
Two clearly marked tendencies are evident in the educational 
thought of today. One is a changing conception of the methods 
and content of elementary education, from the formal and log- 
ical to the inductive and practical. The other is a tendency to 
centralize all educational activities in the state universities. 
Both these tendencies are of vital importance to the normal 
school that intends to send forth graduates fitted to face real life 
and not trained puppets whose heads are filled with special 
methods and devices. 
It is but a few years since any one who had completed a 
classical course in college, who knew some Latin and Greek and 
a smattering of mathematics, was considered competent to teach. 
When an aroused public sentiment first began to demand that a 
teacher have at least as much special preparation as a black- 
smith, the first normal schools sprang up with the emphasis en- 
tirely on the idea of training. For years we had the painful 
spectacle of normal schools advertising that by a few magic 
touches a raw callow youth could be made over into an experi- 
enced teacher with the aid of the new art of pedagogy. Small 
wonder that many of us grew up with scant regard for the work 
_ of the normal school. 
Later a few daring spirits took up the idea that a teacher
-P-A-G-E-243
  243 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 
was an educated person trained for the special work of teaching, 
and there came the normal colleges, still too few in number, giv- 
ing a full four years’ course based on the same entrance require- 
ments as the state universities, and giving from two-thirds to 
three-fourths of their time to academic subjects and from one- 
fourth to one-third to professional preparation, placing the 
training near the end of the course, where there is a solid ground- 
work of knowledge on which to build. 
Last of all came the tardy recognition by the universities of 
the value of normal training, and the inclusion of “departments 
of pedagogy,” “schools of education,” and “teachers’ colleges” 
in the university field of work. And this is followed in the last 
four years by a determined effort to restrict the normal school 
to training for elementary schools, to take away at least two 
years of the four-year course along with all the equipment for 
real college work, to leave a bare baseless grind of pedagogical 
drill to the normal school, and to justify this amazing step on the 
ground that there is involved a duplication of material equip- 
ment. Lest any one think that I mistake the position of the uni- 
versities, I quote from the declaration of principles adopted last 
summer at Salt Lake City by the National Educational Associa- 
tion concerning the normal school: 
“The twentieth century normal school is dedicated to higher 
education, with the special function of supplying teachers for 
the rural schools, the elementary schools, and the high schools. 
“Tt will extend its course of instruction and practice, as 
eonditions may demand, to four-year courses.” 
To this is appended the following note: 
“James H. Baker [President of the Association of State 
Universities], a member of the Committee on Resolutions, called 
attention to the opposite view of the universities, colleges and 
high schools, and to the fact that this statement raises the ques- 
tion of the place for the preparation of high school teachers, in- 
volving costly duplication by normal schools of the colleges of 
liberal arts—whether separate institutions or departments of 
universities—the function of university departments of educa- 
tion, economy, scholarship standards of secondary teachers.” 
In this is involved the strange and illogical proposition that 
for teachers through the seventh grade half educated persons 
are fitted, but in the eighth grade one must be fully educated in 
 
-P-A-G-E-244

order to handle problems which are in no respect as difficult and 
by no means as important as those faced in the lower grades. A 
great deal is said of the danger of drawing teachers away from 
the elementary schools for which the normal school should pre- 
sumably prepare. But, as has been well said by President Kirk 
of the Missouri State Normal, to differentiate sharply the courses 
into two years and four years would invite all the ambitious and 
capable to. take courses specifically preparing for high school 
work, while the sluggish and immature would be shunted off 
into the courses for elementary teachers. Thus we would start 
our cycle of education with incompetent and poorly equipped 
teachers, and that, too, at a time when the very foundations of 
elementary courses are laid open to discussion, when our best 
normal schools are taking up such questions as whether formal 
grammar and arithmetic should be taught at all in the lower 
grades, and many other equally vital questions that go far be- 
yond method into the philosophy of a broad view of life. Surely 
it is a very narrow and one-sided view of education that sees 
only as far as the high school and does not realize that the suc- 
cessful high school is dependent on a high grade of elementary 
school in charge of teachers who have broad enough vision to see 
education in its many phases. 
In proof of the fact that the four year normal course, with 
genuine college classes and college life, does prepare for all 
phases of teaching and does not sacrifice elementary and rural 
work to the high school, I give the following figures showing the 
present location of the 150 graduates of 1913 from Winthrop 
College:

  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 245 
This four-year college course has been the requisite for a 
degree from Winthrop College for over fifteen years, and it is 
evident that the college spirit and traditions are well enough 
fixed to show the permanent tendency of its graduates in choos- 
ing fields of work. 
In this connection one should notice that if the college spirit 
deemed so essential in the high school teacher is necessary to 
make a good teacher in one school it is equally necessary in an- 
other. In fact a narrow specialist might succeed in the depart- 
ment work of a high school where a definite program is worked 
out, but surely for the varied work of the elementary grades we 
need teachers of the breadth and grasp and initiative that come 
from the four years course. Here if anywhere there is needed 
a teacher of such character and force that his influence will last 
longer than the mere memory of his trained methods. As a 
pertinent inquiry we may ask how many universities offering 
pedagogical courses specially preparing their graduates for high 
schools, care for the “duplication” involved in a complete model 
school from the kindergarten through the high school, in which 
the whole bubbling, seething life of a perfectly graded school is 
lived by the normal graduate in his period of practice teaching, 
and from which he comes forth feeling that his school is life and 
not a mere cut and dried department or section of life. 
Believing then, that it is an untenable proposition to at- 
tempt to limit the work of the normal school to elementary 
courses, and that it is equally fallacious to believe that if this 
were the true division of labor the elementary teacher would 
need any less complete course than the high school teacher, I 
lay down the further proposition that the normal course must 
be broad enough to give a thorough education as a prerequisite 
to professional training. 
There is a vast difference between training and the profes- 
sional preparation of teachers. Training is in reality “the low- 
est and poorest part of the professional preparation of teach- 
ers.” Only that teacher can speak “as one having authority” 
who has added to ripe scholarship that special training which 
fits him to mould the minds of his pupils in accordance with a 
well-matured plan. No school boy can complete his elementary 
or high school course and then attain to a man’s grasp of the 
educational problems involved without a course of further study 
that is cultural in its aim and purpose and largely in its content. 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  246 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
Unless we conscientiously put into our elementary schools 
teachers who can look ahead of each day’s routine and see the 
field of education before them, our high schools and universities 
will find their own work cut off at the source. Education must 
be conceived of as a unit before we can take our full place in 
building up a democratic nation. We must put away the child- 
ish notion that each department of education can stand alone 
and not fit into a complete scheme. The teacher in the element- 
ary grades who expects each day’s work to mean more than ques- 
tions and answers on unrelated fragments of knowledge must 
have in her mind’s eye the whole scheme of education and must 
make each question bear on the line of permanent development 
just as the sculptor keeps his eye on the vision of his completed 
work and wastes no stroke of the chisel. To do this the teacher 
must have that broad culture that comes from education rather 
than from training. I think every one of us has in mind con- 
scientious teachers who have laboriously perfected themselves 
in the mechanics of their trade, who are letter-perfect in the 
arts of pedagogy, but whose minds are hopelessly closed against 
a new idea, who blindly stifle whatever gasps of originality orig- 
inates in their grades. 
What our whole country needs today, and especially the 
South in its rapid expansion and facing of new problems, is not 
well-meaning persons with their heads crammed with ‘methods 
and devices,” but genuine leaders of people, young men and 
women who will make the school the social center of the com- 
munity. Teachers and leaders of this stamp must have spent at 
least the time of a college course in contact with the inspiring 
influence of great teachers, must have learned the needs and 
aspirations of mankind, must have broadened and developed 
their own power of social action by concerted work with other 
students of like aims, in short must have caught the glow of 
genuine college spirit. Then, and not until then, they are in con- 
dition to take up the technique of their profession and to try to 
get that professional training which will make them artists, not 
artisans.

COUNCIL MEETING. 
The meeting was called to order at 3:00 P. M. by Dr. J. H. 
Phillips, of Birmingham, Alabama, Council Vice-President, who 
presided during the meeting. 
VICE-PRESIDENT PHILLIPS: Ladies and Gentlemen: I wish 
to extend a welcome to all who are not members of the Council, 
and to say that the meeting is entirely free to all visitors, and 
we will be glad to have as many as possible present; but in order 
to ascertain who are members of the Council, I wish to ask the 
Secretary to call the roll of the membership of the Council, in 
order to ascertain how many Council members are present at 
this meeting, and it seems to me we might have, not only how 
many of the Council members are present this afternoon, but 
how many are present in attendance at other meetings of the 
Association. 
I wish to emphasize the fact that the Council of the Southern 
Educational Association has not occupied the position that it 
deserves to occupy in connection with the work of the Southern 
Educational Association, and it is desirable that its members 
should become more active, and should identify themselves with 
the work of the Association, in order that it may be more 
effective in the realization of the plans and purposes contem- 
‘plated at its organization. 
IT now ask the Secretary to call the roll of the membership. 
(Secretary calls roll.) 
VICE-PRESIDENT PHILLIPS: Are there any other items of 
business that should properly belong to this occasion? If none, 
we will proceed to discuss the program of the Council. 
The first topic this afternoon is “State and County Organiza- 
tion for the Administration and Supervision of Schools.” This 
topic will be opened by the Hon. J. Y. Joyner, State Superin- 
tendent of Education of North Carolina, but owing to the fact 
that Dr. Joyner is absent, I will request Prof. W. K. Tate, of 
Columbia, S. C., to open the discussion. 
Pror. W. K. TaTE: A word is perhaps necessary as to 
how this program was arranged. Dr. Abercrombie, the presi- 
dent of the Southern Educational Council, is, as you know, 
busily engaged in directing the affairs of the nation at Wash- 
ington, and consequently found himself unable to give any time 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  248 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
to the preparation of this program. Dr. Phillips was, unfortun- 
ately for us, in Europe during the past summer, and a few 
weeks ago I had a letter from Dr. Abercrombie asking me to 
suggest a program. The topic before you is one which I selected 
as perhaps offering a wide field of investigation and discussion 
by the members who are present here this afternoon. 
The State and County Organization for the Administration 
and Supervision of Schools has not the “ginger” in it that some 
other topics might have had, for example, a topic that was sug- 
gested, “The Desirability of State Manufacture of Textbooks.” 
It is not calculated to arouse the enthusiasm that a topic of that 
kind might arouse, but I believe from my own experience with 
the school systems of the South that we will have to settle 
this question before we can make the right sort of progress. 
In my work in South Carolina I have noticed that the col- 
leges of the State are able to do things which the State Depart- 
ment of Education is not able to do. They are entrusted with 
funds which the State Department of Education is not able to 
secure. I have wondered why this is true. I believe that the 
condition comes from the fact that we have in the State Depart- 
ment of Education of all our Southern States no opportunity of 
forming a policy which shall look farther than the immediate 
future. 
Dr. Johnson, the president of our State Normal School, is 
here today. His is one of the best institutions in the South. Dr. 
Johnson’s normal school is entrusted to a board of trustees. 
These trustees are appointed by our legislature in South Caro- 
lina for overlapping terms of office. They constitute a continu- 
ing body. This body selects the president of this college, and on 
his nomination and advice elects the professors and heads of de- 
partments and outlines the policies of the college, which conse- 
quently do not simply look forward to one year or two years, 
but indefinitely into the future. 
The same thing is true of our State University, and of our 
other educational institutions—the board of trustees is a con- 
tinuing body. 
When we come, however, to the State Department of Edu- 
cation in all of our Southern States we find that there is little 
opportunity to outline a constructive policy which looks for- 
ward more than four years. The State Superintendent of Edu- 
cation is an officer elected by the people. The people have no
-P-A-G-E-249
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 249 
adequate way of looking for the man. We have a good one in 
South Carolina now, one of the best in the South, a man who is 
doing a great work for the schools of our State, but the fact that 
we have him is more or less an accident. The people must select 
the man from among those who run for the office. It seems to 
me that before the State Department of Education in any South- 
ern State can lay out plans comparable with those which Dr. 
Johnson or Dr. Whitfield projects for the colleges, we must 
have some sort of way of giving a measure of continuity to the 
State Department of Education. The question I want to pre- 
sent is this: is there any reason why the State Board of Educa- 
tion, that. has charge of the common schools of South Carolina, 
should be elected in a different way from that which has charge 
of Winthrop College, or other educational institutions? If the 
legislature appoints one, why not have the legislature appoint 
the other in the same way? Is there any reason why Dr. John- 
son, whom I am using for the purpose of illustration because 
he is here from my own State, should be elected by the Board 
of Trustees of Winthrop College that would not also apply to 
the State Superintendent? Why should not one be elected by 
a competent board as well as the other? Why not give this 
committee of the people of South Carolina the same oppor- 
tunities of hunting for the right man that is given to the board 
of trustees of one of our state colleges? i 
What should be the organization of a State Department of 
Education? Of what officers should it be composed? Most of 
our states have the High School Inspector. Our Southern 
States most of them have one or more Rural School Super- 
visors. One of them, at least, has a man who looks after the 
health of the school children of the state, the sanitation of the 
school buildings, etc. What other officials should we have in 
the State Department of Education in order to get adequate 
supervision of our schools? Should we have a State Director 
of Elementary Agricultural Education connected with the State 
Superintendent’s office who should formulate and execute plans 
for agricultural instruction in the schools? Ought there to be 
a State Architect, or a State Inspector of School Buildings, or 
ought there to be a State Director of Elementary Negro Educa- 
tion? Should you have a State School Auditor? We have a 
great many State Superintendents of Education here this after- 
noon. What officers should you have in your department?  
-P-A-G-E-250
250 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
Then when you come down to the county, how should the 
County Board of Education be selected? Should it be elected 
by the people for overlapping terms? Should it be appointed 
by the State Boards? Should it be elected by the County 
Court? 
In order to give continuity to the educational work of the 
county, in order to enable the county to have a plan for the 
administration and supervision of the schools, ought the County 
Superintendent to be elected by the people or selected by the 
County Board? 
Is there any more reason why Dr. Phillips should be elected 
by a board of trustees in Birmingham than that the Superin- 
tendent of the County in which Birmingham is located should 
be elected by a board of trustees for the county? Should not 
the commission form of government, as we apply it to cities, 
be applied to the county school system as well? Ought we not 
to have a way of finding our man, and not simply limit our 
choice to the men who ask for the job? I should like to have 
this body discuss that question. If that man is to be elected by 
the people, or to be selected by the board, what are the relations 
between this County Superintendent and the Board? 
In the county what other school officers should there be? 
Should there be a County Director or Supervisor of Country 
Schools, as we have in some counties of the South? Should 
there be one for every thirty or fifty teachers? Ought there 
to be a County Director of Agricultural work for boys, corres- 
ponding to our Boys’ Corn Clubs? Ought there to be a County 
Director of Club Work, like our Girls’ Tomato Club or Canning 
Club Work? What should be the relation of that officer to the 
State school system? Ought there to be a Negro director of 
work among the Negro schools? What officers should that 
County Superintendent have in order adequately to supervise 
his schools? These are some of the questions which occur to 
me. I have my own mind pretty well made up as to what I 
should like to see in my own state. 
It seems to me that this educational body ought to be the 
most influential in the South, and that we ought to get together 
and thresh out some of these fundamental things that are right 
at the basis of the school work. We ought to come to some 
sort of a conclusion that we ought to be able to make, in a 
measure, apply to our states. We are all alike in many re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 251 
spects, and we should be able to do important work for all. 
Some of these things I have in mind will not come to pass in 
South Carolina in twenty years, others may, perhaps, in ten or 
fifteen years, but I am satisfied of this, that we will never get 
anywhere until we find out something of the direction in which 
we are going. 
These are some of the questions that were in my mind 
when the general topic for today was put on the program. 
(Applause). 
VICE PRESIDENT PHILLIPS: I am obliged to Mr. Tate for 
opening up the discussion so clearly. It is a question that 
doubtless needs discussion at this time, when the new educa- 
tional life in the South has possibly made obsolete some of the 
forms of expression already devised for that life in the form 
of organization. 
Would be glad to hear further discussion of this phase of 
the subject of organization and supervision of state school sys- 
tems. Would be glad to hear from any one. Some of the state 
superintendents present could doubtless throw some light upon 
this question from the viewpoint of the opening of the discus- 
sion. 
(—————————__) _ I would like to ask one question. Are 
there any States in the South where the State Boards of Edu- 
cation do elect the superintendent? 
(Prof. Tate): No, sir; the Governor appoints in Ten- 
nessee. I think that is the only place where he is not elected. 
(————————__)_ IIs there any State in the United 
States? 
(Prof. Tate): Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey— 
none in the South. In Virginia the State Board of Education 
elects in cases of vacancy. 
VICE PRESIDENT PHILLIPS: Will any one volunteer to dis- 
cuss this question? 
PRoFr. WHITSON: It seems to me as if Mr. Tate has gone, 
as I very much desired him to do, beyond his subject, and it 
has occurred to me that this probably would be an appropriate 
time to ask the question as to whether, as a rule, we are at 
present ready to discuss that feature of education, or not—the 
work of the State Superintendent in education. Let our minds 
go back over the last few years in the South,—to the struggle 
for better education. This question has been largely discussed, 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  252 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
and wonderful enthusiasm has been generated. Never before 
has there been so much literature on the subject,—the maga- 
zines, the daily papers, the press, the books—everything is con- 
tributing to this question. 
Now it occurs to me, has not the time come to go over this 
rich storehouse of material which has been collecting and gath- 
ering here for the last ten or fifteen years,—has not the time 
arrived when we should get a general perspective, when this 
council, a part of the Southern Association, should take up the 
general question of a system of public education for the South, 
and the first thing to do is to get a general perspective of the 
entire problem, and after we have commenced on that, and got 
the general perspective, then it seems that we could logically 
discuss these various features. 
I was reading in the Bible the other night, and I read a 
passage that I have read often, but I never understood what 
that passage meant until I attended this Council meeting. The 
Bible said, don’t put new cloth on old clothes, or new wine in 
old bottles. I never knew what that meant before until I 
_thought we were going to come here, and before we had settled 
on the fundamentals, or had formed in our mind, or before we 
had given any written expression at all as to what a public 
school system for the South should be. 
Why, in my state, we go to the Legislature with some- 
thing, and the Legislature tacks a little something on, until we 
have a perfect crazy quilt system, and I dare say this is true 
in Tennessee, in Virginia, and all the states in the South. 
I believe the time has come when we need new bottles and 
new cloth. We are not ready to do the patching, and I do not 
know, fellow teachers, of a greater service that this organiza- 
tion could render to every county and state superintendent 
than if we could combine, and bring together and winnow out 
and formulate a good, common-sense, practical system of pub- 
lic education for the South. That is the first problem. Then 
we can discuss the relations of the County Superintendent, the 
State Superintendent, the State Board, because you cannot dis- 
cuss one feature of this great educational problem without 
having some general perspective, some general idea of the thing 
as a whole that we are working out. (Applause.) 
VICE PRESIDENT PHILLIPS: Any further discusssion. The 
topic, your remember, is what is the best organization of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 253 
State Department of Education for the administration and 
supervision of schools. 
Dr. JOHNSON: Just a word along the line suggested by 
my friend Dr. Whitson. We have that crazy quilt school law 
in South Carolina, and I do not know whether it is crazier any- 
where else in the South than with us, and recognizing that fact, 
about three years ago, on the recommendation of our wide- 
awake and progressive State Superintendent of Education, to 
whom Prof. Tate has referred, a commission on the revision of 
the school law of South Carolina was formed. That commis- 
sion worked hard for a year, and revised the school law, got 
the kinks out and the discrepancies, and those things that ought 
not to be in it, contradictions, and so on, and proposed a new 
system for this Southern State, and we thought that we had a 
pretty good thing. We kept in as much of the democracy as 
possible, we knew that the charge would be made by the poli- 
ticians that it was aiming at concentration, taking away from 
the people their rights, and all that kind of thing, so, keeping 
that in mind, we drew up the law keeping as much of the dem- 
ocracy as possible, and we arranged for this County Board of 
Education to elect the Superintendent of Education. We 
thought we had a lot of fine things in it. We had it presented 
—met the legislature by agreement and appointment, and pre- 
sented it by word of mouth, and explained it, and we didn’t get 
a vote, and haven’t got one up to this time. I mean to say that 
we did not get anything, that they thought it was too much 
centralized, and took it out of the hands of the people to too 
great an extent. Are the people ready for it? 
PrRoF. WHITSON: That was my object, to get it worked 
into public sentiment. 
Dr. JOHNSON: We distributed it in pamphlet form, ex- 
plained it to the newspapers, distributed it over the state, and 
nothing has come of it yet, and it has been there three years. 
Still, I hope the labor has not been in vain. 
(—————————_-)_ I would like to know, Dr. Phillips, if 
there are any states in the South where the County Superin- 
tendents are elected by the County Board of Education. 
VICE PRESIDENT PHILLIPS: I will ask Mr. Willingham, of 
Alabama, to answer that qusetion. 
Mr. WILLINGHAMS: Louisiana, I think. North Carolina. 
(————————_)_ Isn’t Georgia that way? 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  254 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
(————————-)_ No, Georgia has some counties, a 
number of counties, where the Board of Education elects the 
superintendent. It was formerly the case that the County 
Board elected the superintendent altogether, but recently we 
have changed the law, and in most of the counties the people 
vote directly for the County Superintendent. 
(—————————-)_ How are these County Boards of Edu- 
cation elected, where they elect the superintendents? 
(—————————_)_ They are appointed by the grand jury. 
VICE PRESIDENT PHILLIPS: Any other questions? I do 
not object to how many questions you ask, so you do not ask © 
them of the chair. 
Pror. HILL, OF NoRTH CAROLINA: We have a system in 
our state that grew up some years ago, by which the legislature 
names the county boards in almost all the instances in our state. 
This is gradually and in a measure being done away with, and 
various counties are coming in,—since the Stanley amendment 
was adopted in the state, it got rid of a good deal of illiteracy 
around the polls. Prior to that time it was essential that we 
have some manner by which we could have county organiza- 
tions other than submitting to illiteracy. Since then a great 
many counties are coming out gradually, the probability is all 
will be out, and that system has worked remarkably well. The 
legislature elected the county boards, the county boards elected 
the superintendent in most instances, except in those counties 
since the conditions changed. 
VICE PRESIDENT PHILLIPS: Of how many does the county 
board consist? 
Pror. Hitt: Of three members, invariably. This system 
has been in effect for quite a number of years, but as I said, it 
is gradually going out. 
Cot. ARENDEL: Did the County Court ever elect the County 
Board of Education? 
Pror. Hint: We have no County Court. The County 
Court has nothing to do with our educational system, and poli- 
tics but little. 
Pror. E. E. RAWL: In connection with this action of the 
appointment of the County Superintendent, it may be of inter- 
ets to know of a new law that has been passed the last year in 
the State of Iowa, that I think very promising. It is a law that 
provides that the presidents of school boards and the repre- 
/
-P-A-G-E-255
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 255 
sentatives of certain rural districts shall elect the county super- 
intendent. 
VICE PRESIDENT PHILLIPS: We have two topics on the 
program for the afternoon. The first topic is state organiza- 
tion, the next is the best county organization. Let us keep 
these topics clearly in mind, and we will discuss now the state, 
and then a little later we will come to the county. 
Pror. E. E. RAWL: Pardon. The gentleman who intro- 
duced the topic raised the question of the county organization. 
Hon. H. J. WILLINGHAM, State Superintendent of Ala- 
bama: Mr. Tate, who opened this discussion, asked a number 
of very pertinent questions on the general topic of state organ- 
ization, and also on the question of county organization. He 
made out this program, he has given a deal of study to the 
matter. My inquiry is if he will not himself answer his own 
questions, and place it more specifically before us. 
VICE PRESIDENT PHILLIPS: We will ask Mr. Tate, after a 
while, to close this discussion on the state organization, and 
answer the questions that are raised. Are there any others 
that wish to speak on this question? 
Pror. D. C. Hutu: Referring just a moment to the re- 
marks made by my friend Mr. Whitson, it occurs to me that 
we have been thinking and talking about education long enough 
to have our prospective pretty well clarified. We know pretty 
definitely, I take it, what the content should be. Whatever it 
is it has to be administered, and it occurred to me that the 
question which Mr. Tate raised a moment ago when he asked 
if there should not be in the State Board of Education the same 
degree of continuity which obtained in boards of trustees of the 
higher institutions, is not only a vital one, but one of tremend- 
ous significance. I think it should be so. I have wondered also 
if there is any reason why the same board which controls the 
colleges should not also control the common schools—whether 
or not we need a multiplicity of boards of control, one for the 
University, one for the A. & M. Colleges, another for the nor 
mal schools. Why not put the whole scheme of education of 
the state under one board? Perhaps the question has already 
been answered by the gentleman here that concentration is a 
thing which politicians are afraid of. Are we not all pretty 
well agreed that this sort of concentration, were it not for the 
difficulty that we encounter at the hands of politicians, would
-P-A-G-E-256
  \ 
256 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
be a good thing for us? Does not the question resolve itself 
into this one question: How shall the people be educated to see 
the advisability and the need of a general board of state con- 
trol which shall have charge of all these schools, and administer 
the curriculum of the schools, whatever it may be agreed upon 
to be, in the interest of all the people. 
I take it that we all know pretty well that the bane of the 
whole thing, from top to bottom, is politicalism. That is the 
trouble all through; whatever system might be agreed upon by 
one administration would be pretty apt to be dislodged and 
thrown out by another, and some new system installed. It 
seems to me that we could devise some general scheme which 
would make it impossible for one governor’s administration to 
get charge and control of the governing machinery—if possi- 
ble, write it in the constitution and law of the state—let one 
governor appoint a few members of that board, but let the 
membership be so large that he could not by any chance ap- 
point a majority—then we would have taken a good long step 
in the solving of this question. 
Mr. RICHARDS, OF OKLAHOMA: I desire to say to this 
council, in answer to the question, that there is one state in the 
South that has just such a board as- he speaks of. Okla- 
homa has such a State Board of Education. It administers the 
affairs of all of its schools and universities, normal schools, 
the agricultural schools, the public schools, and all of them, 
and I believe that when our people are educated to understand 
the advantages of having this power vested in a board of 
responsible men, when they realize that what is everybody’s 
business is nobody’s business, that they will not be so afraid 
of concentration. 
It is merely a matter of simplifying the administration of 
schools. It is a matter of fixing responsibility and I believe 
that the sooner we, as school men, get that point of view, and 
are not afraid to stand up before the people and advocate just 
these things that we know are right, and for the best interest 
of the schools, the sooner the people will come to our point of 
view, and I believe that the thing that this council should do 
at this time is to appoint a committee that will draft a policy 
of administration for the schools of the South, and present it 
to this council at its next annual meeting, and let it become the
-P-A-G-E-257
         257 
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 
crystalized policy of this body, to get it actually before the 
South. 
Pror. WHITSON: Why not make that embrace, instead of 
the question of administration merely, an organized system of 
public instruction at every point in the South, that we may 
have a rallying cry, something to go before the people? Why 
take just one phase of the question? 
Dr. PHILLIPS: The subject is quite a broad one, and we 
will have to take it piece meal for discussion, at least. 
The gentleman from Oklahoma has referred to his state 
as being an example of this method of having a concentrated 
board, as I understand. The chair will take the liberty of ask- 
ing this question: Has that system eliminated politics? 
Mr. RicHarDs: I should not like to refer to Oklahoma’s 
experience, but would like to say, in explanation of that answer, 
that peculiar conditions confronted us in the State of Okla- 
homa, and I believe that we are now on a firm basis, and that 
the time has arrived when it is going to work out very success- 
fully indeed in the administration of schools in Oklahoma. 
Mr. EVANS, OF OKLAHOMA: This council has come around 
to a good thing—Oklahoma—and I am very glad to bear wit- 
ness with my friend here with respect to this trial that Okla- 
homa is making in regard to concentration. He is right about 
that. I know you have reason just now to look askance at 
Oklahoma’s school record, but I believe that Oklahoma has 
been misadvertised, that we are all suffering from the genus 
political demagogue, and we are going to keep that up until 
finally the States of this Union agree to do just as the State of 
Oklahoma has done, with that splendid Christian governor at 
its head,—I happen to know him and his life, and I happen to 
know that the change in the school system has taken its start 
in his Christian desire for better service for the childhood of 
the state, and I want to say to you that I know that out of this 
desire grew this law that said do away with all these different 
boards for the management of our schools, and concentrate in 
one board, for the very reason that our friend over there who 
just preceded Mr. ‘Richards gave, to eliminate the chance for 
political intrigue, and to avoid duplication, both as to work and 
expenses, and the result was just what he expected on that, Mr. 
Chairman, a fight, a wonderful fight, a terrible fight. I shall 
not go into the discussion of that war, but after the clouds 
17   
-P-A-G-E-258
   
  258 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
cleared away we can see clearly that Governor Cruse has taken 
firm ground, and has taken advance ground, and I want to say 
to you that out of that fight have grown better things. Every- 
one of you I know is hoping to arrive at that point, in all of our 
affairs, in state education and state business, where we may 
have a non-political condition of affairs, and I want to say to 
you that hereafter Oklahoma, in choosing the particular policy 
of that state, it has accomplished one great good, in regard to 
the tenure of office, and if it has done nothing more than that, 
it has done a wonderful service, and I believe the gist of the 
matter is a matter of concentration, a matter of having the 
State Superintendent of Education a man chosen in such a 
way that he knows he has the force of certain great elements 
around about him, and I say to you that Oklahoma’s plan is all 
right—it is going to work out a more helpful condition in that 
state. 
Mr. JORDAN, OF ARKANSAS: These friends of ours are 
talking about concentration, but who is going to be the con- 
centrator? 
(————————__) The Governor of the State. 
Mr. JORDAN: Then you give him the political power that 
the Governor of our State has, and on our Board of Education 
one-half are teachers and the other half are politicians, and 
our people are complaining about it today. How are you to 
select this concentrated power? By the voice of the people? 
By the action of the school teachers throughout the state? It 
is a difficult matter to decide, and it is a dangerous matter to 
establish an educational heirarchy in any state. I have had 
some experience in examining these questions, and I find that 
most states are unfortunately organized so as to give the Gov- 
ernor too much power of appointment. Why, the state board 
that controls our university is appointed for their political in- 
fluence, and not for their special power in educational develop- 
ment. We would like to change the situation, and have tried 
for some time in the state to have our State University Board 
elected by the people, as our congressmen are elected, but the 
politicians beat it down, and so long as the Governor has the 
appointing power, you are going to have a centralized executive 
in the branches of education for which he selects them. 
Dr. PHILLIPS: Any further discussion?       
-P-A-G-E-259
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 259 
Mr. GLENN, OF GEORGIA: This is an interesting question 
that you are having here. I had noted with interest in this 
discussion the reference to the politician, how you are going to 
eliminate him. I have lived a good long time, and I have 
studied the politician a good deal. He is a very interesting per- 
sonality. When he is on your side, he is a great big good fel- 
lew, but when he is on the other side, then the devil himself is 
not meaner than the politician. I do not believe you have, Mr. 
Chairman, any more fundamental question than this very ques- 
tion you have injected before this council this afternoon. You 
all have your dreams. There is not a man of this fair South 
that hasn’t a beautiful dream of an ideal system of education, 
an ideal board, and an ideal superintendent, and all the ideal 
functionaries necessary to make the organization perfect. We 
look at some of these perfect business organizations that we 
find all over the country. We see how perfectly a railroad is 
organized, and how systematically and how accurately and how 
reliably its business is done. We look at one of these great 
banking institutions with its board of directors serving for life, 
most of them, and its president serving as long as he behaves 
well, and its cashier serving as long as he is honest and efficient, 
and every one of us thinks that is the kind of an organization 
that we want for the schools, and we lie down and dream, and 
dream about the time coming when we can have that sort of 
thing. 
I wish to the Lord any one of us had the power to put into 
operation any one of these beautiful dreams of effective and 
advancing service to the people, through the right kind of or- 
ganization. 
I will tell you what my dream is, Mr. Chairman and gen- 
tlemen, if we could get it. I have seen it in the concrete in a 
small way, and that concrete case is a board of education serv- 
ing for life, and self perpetuating. I do not remember how the 
thing got started, but somebody away back yonder started the 
thing that way, and it has been in operation now I know for 
over thirty years, and that is one thing the politicians in the 
locality where it exists have tried to break up, but they could 
not do it, and now, so far as I know, the politicians in the 
locality do not tackle it any more, and the people in that peculiar 
locality see to it that the best men in the community are elected 
to fill vacancies on that board, when one occurs, and that board
-P-A-G-E-260
  260 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
of education consists of the very highest type of men that they 
have in the whole community. I do not know how the thing has 
ever been carried on so successfully, but it has been done down 
there in Georgia. My friend right here has a similar organiza- 
tion to it, and he has been there for fifty years, is it—I don’t know 
how long he has been there, but the thing is organized, and it is 
carried on, and the people who are responsible for the organiza- 
tion perpetuate the organization themselves. 
Now if that can be done in a little county, and it is done in 
a half dozen or more counties in my state, why can’t we in every 
state in the South have a Board of Directors, a State Board of 
Directors, or a State Board of Education, appointed somehow, 
I don’t know how you are going to get them, but if you once get 
such a board as that, and let them perpetuate themselves as long 
as they behave, you have got the ideal that I am talking about, 
and I tell you now that one of the curses of our whole educa- 
tional system is this perpetual, this constant change in the 
offices of your chief educational functionary. Why, there is not 
a man in any state that I know of in the South that just about 
the time be begins to be efficient for service, somebody manages 
to get him out of office, some way or other, and that is the thing 
that you want to put a stop to, gentlemen. I know what I am 
talking about, and what I have in mind in connection with this 
service, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, is that if this council can 
formulate some scheme by which you can get ten or fifteen of 
the best men in your state to start an organization of this kind, 
and then let those ten or fifteen of the very best men, or what- 
ever their number, elect an efficient man, and hold him there as 
long as he is efficient, then you will get results; and let those ten 
or fifteen, or whatever number you may want to control the edu- 
cational affairs of your state know that when they are once in 
power they are only to be removed from power just as your 
Justice of the Supreme Court in the Government is to be re- 
moved from power—let him be removed from power by mal- 
feasance of power and abuse of his trust. You will never have 
permanency in your organization, and largest development 
under your organization, until the tenure of office is made more 
secure than it is today, and if this council can devise a scheme 
of that kind, suggest it to the people all over these states, some- 
thing that is practicable and feasible, you will have done the

educational interests of this country the greatest service that 
ever has been done for us. (Applause). 
CECIL H. SEIGLER, AIKEN, S. C. 
All of you are familiar with the fact that only a few years 
ago the office of School Commissioner, or County Superintendent 
of Education was a very minor place; and required no special 
skill, or knowledge to attend to its affairs. But within the past 
eight or ten years there has been a decided improvement, and 
each year more is required of the office. It is no longer merely 
a place to pension some old politicians, or some faithful old 
school teacher who has failed to keep the pace with the advanc- 
ing years. But the demands today are for an active young man, 
or, a vigorous old man, well versed in the methods of teaching, 
of farming, and of home building. In the great majority of the 
counties of the United States, the County Superintendent of 
Education is the only man, his is the only office and the only 
force trying to upbuild the county as a whole. The farmers’ 
organizations are growing, and are doing a great work, but it 
will be a long time before they will be able to do what the county 
superintendent, with the assistance of his teachers is in a posi- 
tion to do. 
The County Department of Education, then, is the hub of 
the county’s activities. 
The hub of a wheel is that part upon which is built the 
whole structure. In itself, alone, it is useless, without it the 
spokes and the rim are useless, yet altogether they make an or- 
ganization upon whose revolutions depend the commerce, and 
the civilization of the nations. The wheel is no stronger than 
the hub. A spoke may break, the rim may split, the tire may 
run off, but if the hub is strong the wheel will hold together 
until reinforcements arrive. This being true, then who should 
be the hub of the county wheel? 
Who is your County Superintendent of Education? Is he 
a man who can tell the most funny jokes, who can shake the 
most hands and can kiss the most babies, and make the most 
promises in a political campaign? There are no objections to 
these things; they are good in their places, and help to carry 
out good policies, sometimes; but do you think that a bank ora 
cotton mill, or a railroad board of directors would select a man 
whose only qualifications were those that I have just enumer- 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
  262 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
ated? My business experience is that a man, for superintend- 
ent or management of a business concern is selected on account 
of his qualifications for the place. 
What are the duties of the County Superintendent of Edu- 
cation? In our State they are to visit the schools once a year, 
if practicable, to keep a record of all vouchers, approved, and 
of all teachers’ certificates. To make such suggestions for the 
improvement of the schools as he may deem best, and to re- 
main in his office two days of each week. These in the main, 
constitute the duties of the office. But if he is to be the hub of 
the county wheel, what are his duties? First, he needs an office, 
fitted for a systematic keeping of all records, as is becoming for 
any business office. It should be located, preferably, in the 
county court house, should be large and comfortable. There 
should be an assistant, to do the clerical work, and to act for the 
superintendent in his absence. 
The duties of the County Superintendent of Education, if he 
is the right man for the place, are, assist in selecting the teach- 
ers for the schools under his supervision, assist in preparing 
plans for, and building new school houses, and in getting the 
proper equipment for the same; consult with, and work with the 
teachers for the advancement of the schools and the communi- 
ties; consult with and advise farmers in the conduct of their 
farms (be real live farmers’ agents for the help of the farmers) ; 
be able to advise and to plan the best methods for the improve- 
ment of the homes. His office should, in the average county, be 
a clearing house for those who have things to sell, and for those 
who want to buy. 
There should be a supervising teacher for the rural schools, 
a domestic science teacher, and, I think, a supervising teacher of 
manual arts. These should be directly under the supervision of 
the County Superintendent of Education; and he should be well 
enough versed in these different departments to be able to advise 
with these teachers, and to direct their work. He should never 
be so tied down to the clerical work of the office that he could 
not leave, at any time, and go to any part of his county that may 
need assistance, or his advice. It is not a very popular thing in 
some counties that the County Superintendent should aid the 
Negro schools, in any way. But our civilization will be based 
upon what our citizenship is. Are the nations to judge us by 
what our highest ideal is, or will they consider all in making up
-P-A-G-E-263
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 263 
their estimate? Are we to neglect those who have been placed 
in our care, or are we to prepare them for their place in our 
country? If they are to be workers why should they not be 
taught to do their work well? Is it not true that a trained horse 
can do more and better work than an unbroken one? We should 
supervise the work done by the Negro teachers, and see that 
their pupils are taught to be useful, not useless citizens. Which 
costs the state more, a self-supporting man, or the one in the 
poor house? I believe there should be a supervisor of manual 
training (preferably farming), also one of domestic science for 
the Negro schools. Teach them to work, and how to do it. They 
are nearly all farm laborers, cooks and laundresses, though there 
are many nurses among them (for white people), there should 
be more nurses for their own race. 
The selection of the County Superintendent of Education. 
There should be a County Board of Education, consisting of five 
men, elected for a term of four years, so arranged as to time of 
expiration, that there would always be two of the old board sery- 
ing with the new members. These men should be directly re- 
sponsible to the people. They should have the power to select a 
superintendent of education for the county; just as the trustees 
now have for the selection of a teacher, and should employ him 
according to his qualifications, for so long a time as his services 
are good. The superintendent, so selected should serve as the 
secretary of the board. Meetings should be held monthly, or 
whenever it seems to the majority that a meeting is desirable, 
or upon the call of the secretary. 
This superintendent of the schools, or secretary of the 
Board of Education should have full charge of the schools of the 
county, just as a city superintendent now has of the schools of 
his city, of all teachers and supervising teachers. Any question 
as to his ruling, or conduct should be appealed to the County 
Board, from that to the State Board. The salaries of the County 
Board should be per diem, with a limit as to the number of days. 
To get a man for superintendent, who could meet the re- 
quirements as outlined here, it would be necessary to give a sal- 
ary of such size that it would command the best men in the pro- 
fession and would be an inducement to professional men to pre- 
pare themselves for such work, just as is done in banking, en- 
gineering, mill work and other professions. The county school
-P-A-G-E-264
264 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
system will never be a real system, accomplishing the best re- 
sults until something like this is done. 
The county superintendents of education have already 
added millions of dollars to the wealth of the nation, I might say 
directly, by their interest in the Boys’ Corn clubs, which was in- 
augurated by a man holding a position of this kind, a great deal 
of wealth was added by the Pig clubs, and more millions have 
been added by the work of the Girls’ Tomato clubs, which were 
organized by Miss Marie Cromer, a school teacher of Aiken 
County, South Carolina, now Mrs. Seigler. 
In Aiken County alone, where this latter work was origin- 
ated, with the assistance of the county superintendent, and where 
the Boys’ Corn club has been fostered, a great impetus has 
been given to farming. Farmers and sometimes, merchants 
are beginning to consult with the County Superintendents of 
Education as to the best methods to persue along certain lines. 
All these things are being done, yet our work is just beginning 
to find itself. As the months and the years go on the import- 
ance of this department of the county government will be man- 
ifested, and dignified as has never before been known, will 
place the once despised office on a pedestal of importance where 
it belongs. 
The idea that the County Department of Education is for 
the sole purpose of looking after the text book side of educa- 
tion is, indeed, an erroneous one. Our business is to assist in 
preparing boys and girls for the duties of life—if we fail to do 
this we are neglecting a great opportunity. 
Dr. PHILLIPS: We will now close the discussion of this 
phase of the topic, and proceed with the next phase, the County 
Organization, but before taking up the question of the County, 
we shall ask Prof. Tate to close the discussion. 
Mr. Tate: Of course I realize, as you realize, that any 
scheme that we may have for the reorganization of the State 
Department of Education that will be common to the whole 
South is more or less of a dream at present, as Dr. Glenn says, 
but I have noticed that I have never been able to bring anything 
to realization that was not first a pretty clear vision. I have 
noticed again that dreams, when enough people dream them, 
some way or other have a way of bringing their own realization. 
Personally, I should not be in favor of committing the
-P-A-G-E-265
   JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 265    
State of South Carolina, or any other state in which I am inter- 
ested, to the self-perpetuating Board of Education. I never 
hope and never wish to get the educational institutions of the 
people out of the hands of the people. There is no way of 
getting anything that touches the people out of politics. The 
people are going to determine their educational institutions, 
one way or other. The only thing I am asking for is that we 
give the people a committee of representatives by which they 
ean definitely do that particular thing. 
The board that I would like to have in the State of South 
Carolina would not be a board appointed all at one time by a 
governor, or even appointed by the governor at all. I believe 
it should be a little closer to all the people than a board ap- 
pointed by the governor. I believe the State Board of Educa- 
tion should be appointed by the legislature. These are the 
direct representatives of the people. I believe that that board 
should consist of seven or nine members. Those members 
should be selected, a third of them this year, a third of them 
two years from now, and a third of them two years from that, 
and finally when we get the system into operation, all of them 
will be elected for a term of six years. I believe that in that 
way we could get good men, just as we get the best men of 
South Carolina to serve on Dr. Johnson’s Board, and on our 
other college boards. Politics does not interest these boards. 
No matter how bitter politics gets in South Carolina, I have 
yet to see it enter into the question of electing trustees for the 
colleges. I believe if we can put the people in the way of select- 
ing a state board that they will give us a good one. I believe the 
people can safely intrust the selection of an expert state superin- 
tendent to the state board. 
I believe if we get the idea firmly before the people of the 
Southern States, that in selecting our State Superintendent of 
Education in this way that we are not taking anything away 
from the people, we are just giving them a sensible way to pick 
a man, that we are just giving them a way of avoiding mis- 
takes, that we will succeed. That is not saying we haven’t done 
pretty well in selecting our State Superintendents of Educa- 
tion, but we have no way of forming and executing a construc- 
tive policy. 
When we come to the organization of the State Depart- 
ment, I believe we ought to have a State High School Inspector,   
-P-A-G-E-266
    
      266 
  SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
a Rural School Supervisor, a State School Auditor, a Super- 
visor of Buildings, and a Director of School Hygiene. We 
ought to have an officer to direct the elementary agricultural 
education of the state, and one who would have charge of the 
manual training and domestic science. We ought to have in 
every Southern State a State Director of Elementary Negro 
Education. These officers ought to be appointed, it seems to 
me, by the State Board of Education, on the nomination of the 
State Superintendent of Education. 
I believe that the administration of the county school sys- 
tem should be vested in a County Board of Education consisting 
of three members, one to be elected every two years for a term 
of six years. The County Superintendent of Education should 
be elected by the county board for a term of four years. He 
should have as assistants a County Supervising Teacher for 
Country Schools, a County Supervisor of Negro Schools, a 
County Director of Elementary Agricultural Work, and a 
County Director of the Girls’ Canning Club and Home Arts. 
These assistants should be elected by the county board on the 
nomination of the County Superintendent. 
Dr. PHILLIPS: The next phase of this topic, What is the 
Best County Organization for the Administration and Super- 
vision of Schools, by Fred B. Frazier, State Supervisor of Rural 
Schools, of Tennessee. Mr. Frazier was selected and his name 
placed on the program to open up this discussion, but I am in- 
formed that Mr. Frazier has been called out of the city this 
afternoon. It is a very interesting fact, however, for us to 
know that Mr. Frazier is one of the best looking men in Ten- 
nessee, and has selected as his representative for the afternoon 
Mr. Robertson. I will ask Mr. Robertson to come forward and 
represent Mr. Frazier. (Laughter). The chair has promised 
to help him out if he gets in trouble. 
Mr. ROBERTSON: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen— 
I assure you that this paper was prepared altogether by Mr. 
Frazier. I had nothing to do with that. He furnishes the 
brains, and I simply turn the crank. Mr. Frazier could not be 
with you in person, and left it with me to furnish the good 
looks and the eloquence. So you will listen to the paper.

  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 267 
WHAT IS THE BEST COUNTY ORGANIZATION FOR THE 
ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS? 
FRED B. FRAZIER, NASHVILLE, TENN. 
An organization which has for its purpose the adminis- 
tration and supervision of the schools of a county, must, to be 
efficient, possess at least two qualifications. There must be a 
central authority which is not too cumbersome and it must be 
able to come into close contact with all phases of the school 
work. 
I am frank to say, that I believe this is exemplified in the 
county board system with its members from each school or 
civil district, and the County Superintendent with his district 
supervisors to assist in the work of supervision. 
The county board system of school administration was put 
into operation in Tennessee some five years ago, and has proven 
its worth by infusing business methods into the school work 
of the counties of this state to an extent never known before. 
Money has been saved, the school term lengthened, and the 
efficiency of the teachers vastly increased. 
This board is composed of five men, one from each of four 
districts in the county, and one from the county at large and 
they are elected by the people, and this small unit has full 
charge of all public schools of the county. 
When the law was proposed its opponents raised the ob- 
jection of centralized power, and of being out of touch with the 
small country school. Experience has taught us that by having 
fewer men to compose the board we get better qualified men, 
and instead of being out of touch with the small rural school, 
by reason of their better qualifications, they are really in close 
touch with school conditions, and are able to conduct the school 
work much more efficiently than a larger organization, or for 
instance, the old time board of three school directors to each 
school. Under this plan the average number of school direct- 
ors to the county was between one hundred and fifty and two 
hundred, which rendered it difficult in sparsely settled com- 
munities to get even men who could read and write to say 
nothing of competency in the way of a general knowledge of 
school work. 
The County Superintendent is ex-officio secretary of the 
school board and by virtue of his position recommends all 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
  268 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
teachers. A strong county superintendent can practically 
name and place every teacher in his county, and who should 
be better qualified than he to perform this duty? He knows 
their qualifications, and is, or should be, acquainted with con- 
ditions in each community. 
The county board as here organized does not have author- 
ity to levy school taxes. This power is very wisely left to the 
County Courts which look after the finances of the counties as 
a whole, and if objection be raised to this plan, on account of 
the difficulty at .times encountered in securing a sufficient tax 
levy to maintain an eight or nine months school term, we ans- 
wer that no official is as subservient to public opinion as a 
member of a County Court, and if we have difficulty in getting 
what we want, let us go first to the people and create a public 
demand. We should ask nothing better than the opportunity 
of going before the people with our needs. The trouble is 
rarely with County Courts. They usually represent their peo- 
ple in whatever action they take. 
A county superintendent is an administrative official, and 
is the executive head of the schools. If he does his duty his 
time is taken up with administrative work, and he has little 
time to give to supervision of the-schools. This weakness in 
our school organization has been recognized by the non-pro- 
gressive states, and to supply the defect, county and district 
supervisors have been employed. These supervisors are arms 
of the county superintendent’s office, and are the field lieuten- 
ants, so to speak. If a problem in consolidation, for instance, 
arises, the district supervisor will take immediate charge of it, 
while if no one were there except the county superintendent 
to look after the matter it would probably be impossible for 
him to attend to it. There are always many problems con- 
nected with county supervision arising which county superin- 
tendents, on account of the pressure of administrative work, 
can not give attention. 
We would therefore suggest as the best county organiza- 
tion for the administration and supervision of schools, the 
County Board of Education composed of about five members, 
elected either by the people or by County Courts, with the 
County Superintendent a member of said board. These to be 
directly charged with school adminstration. And for the super- 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 269 
vision, we suggest the County Superintendent, with his assist- 
ants, known as county or district supervisors. 
We are convinced that a school organization, as above out- 
lined, is certainly well suited to our conditions in the South, 
and when composed of efficient officials, is about the most ef- 
fective which can be obtained. 
Dr. PHILLIPS: The discussion of this topic is to be led 
by Mr. L. J. Hanifan, State Supervisor of Rural Schools, 
Charleston, W. Va. 
Mr. HANIFAN: Ladies and Gentlemen—I necessarily have 
a little different idea of the organization of the county, coming 
from a state that is just a little differently organized from most 
Southern States. Now, according to our experience in West Vir- 
ginia, it seems to me that the best organization, the best county 
organization for school purposes is to have a County Board of 
Education. We do not have them. We have a District Board. 
We have a County Superintendent in every county, and then a 
Magisterial District Board. That Magisterial District Board 
has complete charge of affairs in that district, the number of 
schools ranging from 20 to 130, and we would be thoroughly 
satisfied as it is , except that the unit is too small, and in many 
cases the poorer districts are unable to maintain their schools, 
while richer districts in the same county can maintain theirs for 
the full term without any effort. So it seems to me that the 
county, as considered as a whole, is about as small a unit as we 
can hope to have to adjust the finances correctly. : 
I would suggest along the line of Mr. Frazier’s paper that 
we have the County Board of Education proper, consisting of 
four members, elected by the people of the county at large, and 
the whole county vote on each member of that County Board of 
Education. I believe that that is better than to have the Board 
of Education appointed, and I believe that that election ought to 
be a special election, and not held at the regular elections, when 
Congressmen and Presidents and Governors and Justices of the 
Peace and Constables are monopolizing the whole show—that is 
the way it usually works. Have this election a special election, 
and make an educational campaign for the county in the effort 
to get the right man. 
I would have these men elected for a term of eight years, 
one retiring every two years. 
It seems to me that you people in the extreme South, most
-P-A-G-E-270
270 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
of the Southern States, all except West Virginia, ought not to 
have so very much trouble with politics—they ought not to 
bother you so very much, because you have only one party, while 
we have two parties at least, and sometimes three. It seems to 
me that where there are two parties we would have a bi-partisan 
board. I would like to mention why I say this: In our state we 
have a bi-partisan board for the control of state institutions. 
We have two dual boards. One controls the finances and busi- 
ness affairs, and the other controls the educational affairs. They 
are bi-partisan, so when there is a vacancy it is either a Demo- 
crat or a Republican that has to be appointed. If we had these 
men appointed for a term of years, one being appointed every 
two years, you would never have over one new member at any 
time, unless there happened to be a vacancy. 
Then it seems to me that the County Superintendent ought 
also to be elected by the people. However, it might be better to 
have him elected by the board, but once he is elected by the board 
he ought to be free and independent, and for that reason it seems 
to me he ought to be elected by the people, because if elected by 
the board he is in some degree dependent on the board, and under 
obligations to the board for his election. So I would rather have 
the County Superintendent’s election come directly from the peo- 
ple, and have him to be the chairman of that board ex-officio. 
I will not go into the salary, and things of that sort, because 
while I know its importance, yet there is not time to treat of that 
matter. 
I would have this County Board of Education composed of 
four men, the County Superintendent to be elected by the people. 
I would give that Board of Education large authority, as well as 
large responsibility. I know there is a sentiment about Democ- 
racy, we have it in our state, and it is in every state throughout 
the South, and more or less in the whole country there is a strong 
sentiment for Democracy. That is all right, and it is neccessary 
to leave many things to the people, that is pure Democracy. But 
I would do it another way. I would elect these officers, let the 
people elect them, and then after they are elected give them power 
to do something. The people elect these men to administer the 
affairs of the schools, and they should then give them power to 
do something, for if not, they will not be valuable. 
This Board of Education of course ought to be empowered to 
appoint assistant superintendents for the county,—I would say
-P-A-G-E-271
           271 
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 
something on the order of about one superintendent or supervisor 
for every fifty or sixty schools, and let that superintendent be re- 
sponsible to the County Superintendent and the Board of Educa- 
tion. It is impossible to put a supervisor over fifty or sixty 
schools, and expect him to look after everything that happens in 
the schools, because something would happen, when he is in the 
far eastern corner, in the farthest western corner, and thus keep 
him going back and forth, so that he should have one trustee at 
each school, and let him have charge of the building and all things 
pertaining to the building and grounds, and let the Board of Edu- 
cation control the appointment of teachers in that local school. I 
believe that is all I care to say on that subject. 
Dr. PHILLIPS: May I ask you a question? Are the City 
Superintendents elected by the people in Virginia? 
Mr. HANIFAN: No, sir; they are elected by the County 
Board of Education. 
Dr. PHILLIPSS What reason would you have for the election 
of County Superintendents that would not apply just as well to 
the city? 
Mr. HANIFAN: Only that one is rural and the other is in the 
city. There is a difference in the attitude of the people in the 
city and in the country. There is a difference in the attitude of 
people toward these things in the city and in the country. My 
reason there would be just because of this difference. 
Mr. TATE: It would bea question of expediency, then, what 
would give you the most efficient service. 
Mr. HANIFAN: And then, if the County Superintendent is 
elected by that board, he is the creation of that board, and is 
somewhat dependent on it, while if he comes direct from the 
people, he comes just as they do, and takes his place on the board. 
Mr. TATE: The State Superintendent is elected by a board. 
He is under obligations to the board just the same way, but it 
does not produce unpleasant results there. He ought to be sub- 
ject to the board, and under the control of the County Board 
of Education. 
Mr. HANIFAN: I think that is a question. My idea simply 
was this: You see we talk about this Democracy, and it is all 
right. What I mean is, let the people elect these officers, let the 
people themselves elect the officers, and then give them power 
after they are once elected to do something, and so if the County 
Superintendent has his commission from the people themselves,
-P-A-G-E-272
  272 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
the people can hold him responsible, as well as the board, for his 
acts,—that was the idea I had in mind, but I would not make 
any great contention over that point at all. I mention it as 
seeming to me to be preferable for that reason. 
Dr. PHILLIPS: Are your County Superintendents usually 
politicians? 
Mr. HANIFAN: Sometimes they develop very rapidly into 
politicians. 
Dr. PHILLIPS: Before or after? 
Mr. HANIFAN: Sometimes before, and sometimes after- 
wards. 
—__—______——_) Are the County Superintendents of 
West Virginia elected by the people? 
Mr. HANIFAN:_ Yes, sir. 
(————————__) What percentage of them are really 
school men? 
Mr. HANIFAN: They are all teachers. No man can be 
County Superintendent unless he holds a No. 1 certificate. 
Dr. PHILLIPS: What qualifications do you require: 
Mr. HANIFAN: To hold a No. 1 certificate, and be of good 
moral character, etc. No man can be a superintendent unless 
he holds a No. 1 certificate, so he must be a teacher. 
Dr. PHILLIPS: Any further questions to be asked Mr. 
Hanifan? Z. V. Judd, County Superintendent of Education, 
Raleigh, N. C., is absent, and Mr. C. H. Seigler, County Super- 
intendent from South Carolina, has been requested to take the 
place of Mr. Judd. 
Mr. Z. V. Jupp: I have prepared a little something, but 
the subject has been so well discussed that I am afraid some of 
it will be but a rehearsal. 
I believe that the County Superintendent of Education 
should be a man eliminated from politics as much as possible. 
I do not agree with Mr. Whitson, however, that it is not always 
wise to put a new patch on an old pair of breeches, because you 
can sometimes hide the hole until something better can be given 
us—. 
Mr. WHITSON: That was the Bible—not me. That was 
the Bible I was quoting. You are differing from the Bible— 
not me. (Laughter). 
Mr. Jupp: I can remember when I was quite a little boy 
that my father used to go to town sometimes to our county-seat,
-P-A-G-E-273
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 273 
and on his return he would have something to say about the 
County Superintendent of Education. He was at that time one 
of the school commissioners,—usually he said something about 
seeing that man hanging around a saloon and begging some- 
body for money to buy a drink. That was an unfortunate con- 
dition existing in our county for years. After that another man 
was elected that wasn’t much better, and for two or three suc- 
cessive terms men of that stamp were elected as County Super- 
intendent. But conditions have changed somewhat since then. 
I think the people have become more educated. I think all of 
you are familiar with the fact that only a few years ago the 
office of school commissioner or county superintendent was a 
very minor place, and required no special fitness. I want to 
say that down in South Carolina a man does not have to be edu- 
cated at all to hold the place of County Superintendent of Edu- 
eation—he can be just as ignorant as a new born babe, if he can 
just simply get the office. But we have a rural school supervisor 
and farm demonstration agent, and we hope next year to put on 
a domestic science teacher. 
Mr. G. M. LYNCH: I have listened patiently to some of the 
discussion this afternoon. I am just a little bit surprised. You 
know I am rather inclined to believe that we school men are en- 
tirely too much concerned about that terrible thing, this poli- 
tician. (Laughter). The fact of the matter is, the reason why 
the politician is still in the saddle today, and the school system is 
not administered efficiently, is due to the fact that the school man 
is afraid to take his place. (Laughter. Give it to them—that is 
right). 
I believe in having the people have something to do with the 
administration of the school. I believe we ought to have a voice 
in the selection of school officers, from the local, on up to the 
State Superintendent. I believe here is the remedy, rather than, 
as some of you have said, concentrating it in the hands of a 
board which has direct control of the universities and colleges 
and all public schools, thereby giving the universities and col- 
leges the right to dictate. I do not believe that they have a right 
to dictate to the high schools and to the public schools. (You are 
right). For that reason I am opposed to their having control of 
the public school system. (You are right). 
Now then, in order for you to carry out your ideals in educa- 
tion would it not be necessary for you to go to the legislature, and 
18 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  274 ‘ SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
so have them enacted into statutes, or else amend the constitu- 
tion? You have got to do that. Who are you going before? Why, 
those miserable politicians who are elected to the legislature. And 
since we do have to go before the legislature, let’s go with some- 
thing we can do, rather than with something that is so theoretical 
that they look upon you, as legislators often do, as theoretical 
cranks. Let us go before them with clear-cut practical standard 
for the County Superintendent, and say to the Legislature, “Pass 
this statute for us, and make these qualifications necessary for 
the holder of the office of County Superintendent, and we will go 
back to our county and see that nobody is elected who does not 
reach every qualification in the law, and entirely fulfill the law.” 
Then having your law, you have already set your standard, and 
then let the people elect the man that represents the standard. 
But the moment you subtract from the people the right of 
control over the schools, you will find that interest flags, and you 
will find it almost impossible to get the funds necessary for the 
system to run. 
So I want to say to you that if there is to be any resolution 
which will represent the opinion of this council, I sincerely trust 
someone will present a resolution that will not destroy the right 
of the people in this election of the school officers, the County 
Superintendent, or the County Board, or the state officers. But 
on the other hand, keep in mind the setting.of qualifications for 
the county school officers, and then leaving the matter in the 
hands of the people. (Applause). 
Dr. JNO. R. Kirk: I do not think it makes much difference 
what the last speaker thinks or what I think. There is a trend of 
thought which can not be avoided or evaded. It is coming 
steadily, and there are many students that welcome it and fos- 
ter it, and secure its dissemination. 
Now it has occurred to some of us to compare men—to 
compare the presidents of the first twenty-five universities that 
we meet with the State Superintendents of Schools in the first 
twenty-five cities that we visit, and to compare the first rate 
town or state superintendent of schools with the county super- 
intendent of schools. 
It has been the lot of your humble servant to hold the office 
of county superintendent and state superintendent, and to meet 
many years with the county superintendents’ division of asso- 
ciations, and the state superintendents’ division of associa-
-P-A-G-E-275
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 275 
tions. So far as recollection goes, it is difficult to recall the 
high average of professional skill and attainments of those 
noble and distinguished gentlemen constituting the state super- 
intendents of schools. The speaker will put himself in, of 
course, with the average, and we have a job lot always. 
There are defective university presidents. There are weak 
university presidents, sometimes. There are very weak normal 
school presidents that I run across every once in a while. I 
know these fellows, and mercy, mercy, what a lot we were 
when the county school commissioners and county school super- 
intendents used to get together when I was one of them! 
Now, ladies and gentlemen, we need not waste words. We 
need not fear that democracy will destroy itself. We need not 
be afraid, on the other hand, that the recall of judges and the 
recall of their decisions by an intelligent industrial and com- 
mercial community will ever hurt civilization. We are in an 
industrial and commercial age, and the industrial and com- 
mercial communities of all the ages have never destroyed them- 
selves. Now the step is a very short one—it is only one step 
from universal inefficiency, or almost universal inefficiency, to 
quite general efficiency. 
There is no complaint in the cities and towns with regard 
to the destruction of democracy. The people in one large city 
that we know, near us, so clung to democracy that every little 
ward and sometimes precinct had to elect its member of the 
Board of Education of the city, and in all the years that that 
was the case education was inefficient, for every little fellow 
that had pulled on somebody’s boot straps had a voice in the 
Board of Education. How many cities do we know that have 
changed from that close approach to so-called democracy to a 
board chiefly elected by the whole community, and the small 
board that every politician could get a whack at, every news- 
paper could get a chance at, and the community Would begin to 
wake up, and as this has come about, we have found efficiency 
in the village and town and city school administrations. 
What do you think, in the case of a town of two thousand 
population, would be the condition of the town schools if the 
town superintendent had to be elected from among the resi- 
dents of that town? What do you think would be the case if, 
in each city, the Board of Education had to elect the superin- 
tendent from among the residents of the city? What do you 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  276 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
think would be the condition of education if each Board of 
Education determined which political party had a majority in 
the board, and then selected a superintendent in harmony with 
the political sentiments of a majority of the board. 
We have watched, all of us, for years, the Governors of 
states, some good governors, and some pretty bad governors, 
nominate these various state boards from universities and normal 
schools and elemosinary institutions, and have those boards 
confirmed by one or both of the branches of the legislature or 
general assembly. 
In the Northern or Western normal school or agricultural 
board they will pay no attention to the politics or religion of 
the incoming president or professor. You can point to numer- 
ous cities that for years were overwhelmingly Democratic, while 
others were overwhelmingly Republican, and yet the Democ- 
racy of the city elects a body of men more or less regardless of 
their politics and their church, and that body of men, just one 
removed from the complete democracy, that body of men im- 
mediately begins to cast about, and regardless of politics, get 
a superintendent, and think over that long list of efficient ex- 
pert assistant superintendents, without ever knowing their poli- 
tics or their religion. 
It is not necessary—you think ahead of me, every one of 
you—it is not necessary for one of us to multiply words for this 
audience of professional men and women. I venture to express 
the idea that in the great schools of education in our country, 
and some great normal schools, and some great educational clubs 
and societies, unless I have neglected to read what is going on, 
it is the universal trend of the country, the small village and 
rural schools of the country need just such a gentle step from 
universal democracy to professional efficiency that all the cities 
and towns, nearly, of our country have taken. (Applause.) 
Details are needless here. Why need we care whether there are 
five, seven, nine or eleven or three on the County Board of Edu- 
cation? The fact of commission form of government is that 
there is responsibility for not too long a time, and always oppor- 
tunity for recall, both of the judge and his decision, that cannot 
be very long delayed. Then, if we are thinking straight, there 
is coming, just in a little while, in many states the organization 
of the schools at large under just such efficient, expert manage- 
ment as the cities all have. It is only one step from this much-
-P-A-G-E-277
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 277 
loved, soon to be bewailed simple democracy into that same effi- 
ciency that we have in a board of education. 
Now isn’t this true, that a whole board of curators will 
sometimes go wrong, and make a mistake in the president of a 
university, or the selection of the superintendent of city schools, 
or the selection of almost any so-called expert? Then we will 
always be making mistakes, some mistakes, but the cities and 
the institutions are governed by the principle which is ulti- 
mately to reach all the schools of all the counties in all of the 
states. Why, pray tell me, should the president of the univer- 
sity be selected by an expert board? Why should all the ex- 
perts, except one or two, in every state, be appointed by some- 
body, if there is any danger in that? There are just a few gen- 
eral officers that the whole Democracy will be judges of, may 
be, forever. They will be judges of the candidates for Gov- 
ernor,—simple-minded big fellows. (Laughter). Why, I dare say 
that is the ideal of a governor,—who leads the simple life, who 
appreciates the’ true, genuine things that everybody can 
understand,—but what governor should be instrusted with pick- 
ing very many experts, unless somebody is to confirm or reject. 
But, Mr. Chairman, I doubt not there are others more modest 
than even your humble speaker (Laughter). There is an ex- 
pert, Dr. Henderson, on my left, of your own state and city, 
who has studied twice as much on this question as I have, but 
he will never beat me to it, and that is the main principle,— 
getting for the isolated schools what we have for some of them. 
Now this is one of the things, gentlemen, that has been going 
on for two or three years—inside the last three weeks I think 
it has been my lot to stand face to face with a thousand school 
directors—I meet them, from 150 to 200 of them in a county, 
but Lord save me from those gentlemen when it comes to any 
sort of expert judgment in education. They are judges of horses 
and cows, and in a general way of men, good men. They can 
judge whether a man has enough decency or moral character 
in him to be a sheriff, may be they get fooled even then. But 
they have no sort of judgment to pass upon a County School 
Superintendent, and they don’t want it. I have talked to a lot 
of them right: lately, and they say, “Well, Mr. Professor, can 
you tell us of some other way of getting us a County Superin- 
tendent?” I have been thrown with county superintendents, 
some four or five of them graduates of the institution of which 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  278 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
I masqueraded as president, and they don’t know beans. One 
of them talked to me for an hour on his ventilating system, and 
took me ten miles in an automobile to see it, and the ventilation 
was going backwards !— 
Dr. PHILLIPS: The time is brief. 
Mr. PARKS: May I call attention to two good points that 
have been made? This is a very great subject we are on, the 
subject of administration. It is the greatest defect in our sys- 
tem. First, I want to emphasize the point made by the speaker 
from West Virginia, in what he says about the county board. 
I like his suggestion of having the county board elected by the 
people and not all at the same time,—elect two at a time in 
separate years. That is the first suggestion that appeals to me. 
The second, embodying the idea of this gentleman, and 
two or three others who have spoken,—it seems to me that the 
best suggestion that has been made is that the county super- 
intendent should be elected by the board. If you elect him by 
the people he is subject to political conditions; if you elect him 
by the people he will be chosen only from that county, and the 
thing most needed is to get experts in this business of county 
superintendence, and oftentimes you must bring him into the 
county, secure him like you do your college president, so I think 
the best thing is for the county superintendent to be elected by 
the Board, so that you may get, if necessary, an expert from 
the outside. 
There is another point I would like to mention, and here is 
the most difficult point of all. We haven’t paid the County 
School Superintendent a salary sufficient to command many 
men of calibre—occasionally we get a strong man. In my own 
state the salaries are pitifully small. You can’ not expect a 
strong man to come for them. The County School Superin- 
tendent should be paid an adequate salary. As it is, no sooner 
do you get a good man than he leaves you and goes to the city 
or some college, because we do not pay enough to keep him. 
When the County School Superintendent is elected by the 
board, if he is a strong man he can hold his own. You don’t 
need to have too many rules and regulations, where you have a 
strong man, you don’t need to have too much beaureaucratic 
government. I am opposed to centralization. I want us not to 
have the bureaucratic type of government that France has in 
its system of education.
-P-A-G-E-279
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 279 
I tell you, much of the trouble has been with us. It is not 
all politics. We have not presented a clear-cut plan, we haven’t 
agreed among ourselves on a plan, and oftentimes we have poli- 
ticians in our midst. (Laughter). Just because we are educa- 
tors, and have a high and holy cause, and of course we are all 
right,—we need not fear but what our successors will develop 
politically, if they have power and money. There will be poli- 
ticians always. This science of government is a big question, 
never yet settled, and I would regret to see our educational de- 
partment put under any system that ties the hands of the indi- 
vidual. 
Mr. WHITSON: Do you think that by any mechanism that 
we can build the thing up above the fountain source, anyhow? 
Mr. Parks: We must not get away from the people en- 
tirely. 
Mr. WHITSON: Can you do it? 
Mr. Parks: Elect that board by the people at different in- 
tervals, each member at different times. Elect your superin- 
tendent by the board. Pay him a salary as good as you do men 
in other lines of educational work, and then when you get a 
good, strong man keep him. 
Dr. PHILLIPS: The hour is growing late, and I should re- 
gret to detain you here very much longer. There is some bus- 
iness to be transacted by this council, and unless I am com- 
manded to Ses I shall pronounce this discussion 
closed, otherwise I shall proceed to announce that we have 
reached the hour for the transaction of the business of the 
council; but all visitors are requested to remain. No executive 
business will be transacted, and this session is open to the en- 
tire public. We hope that something will accrue from this 
splendid discussion this afternoon of the most important sub- 
ject that could be presented to our body. 
We are now open for the transaction of any business that 
may come before the council. 
) Mr. Chairman, I have a resolution I 
would like to offer: Be it resolved that a committee of three 
be nominated from the floor to draft a general plan of state 
and county organization, the basis of which shall be a state 
commission of three persons and a county commission of three 
persons, elected by the people, these committees to select all 
superintendents, supervisors, and other employes, and to have 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  280 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
general control, similar to the plan of commission government 
now obtaining in cities and even suggested for states. I offer 
that so as to get something before the house. 
) I would like to second the first clause 
of that motion, that there be a commission or committee ap- 
pointed to draft plan, but I would not like to say what kind of 
a plan they should draft. 
(—————————_) There seems to be no second to that 
motion, and I am certain that Mr. Baker and I agree heartily 
as to the advisability of having a commission sum up what has 
been brought forward, so I move that the chair appoint a com- 
mittee of three to take into consideration what has been said 
here this afternoon, and present in concise form, at the next 
meeting of this council, a state and county plan for the admin- 
istration and supervision of the schools. That will be one year 
from now. (Seconded). 
(————————_)__I move to amend by making the num- 
ber five. 
(————————_)_II believe in the small commission. 
Mr. WuiTson: Let me make this inquiry, please, of the 
men here. I have got it on my heart—I haven’t a distinct 
vision myself—but I would like to know what the common 
school ought to be in the South, what the high school ought to 
be in the South, how to raise revenues. This thought has oc- 
curred to me,—what a wonderful thing it would be to get this 
council to meet next summer on Lookout Mountain, somewhere, 
for about a week, and take up every phase and feature of school 
system, where you would have plenty of time, and map it out 
like a state convention,—and what a wonderful thing for us to 
do,—something like that, for us all to discuss and argue it, and 
whip it into shape. 
Pror. TATE: I agree thoroughly there with Supt. Whit- 
son, but since we started out with this particular job, let us do 
this one now, and then some other time we could discuss these 
other things,—devote a whole session to them. 
Mr. WHITSON: You don’t understand. I didn’t mean to 
give more time to this. This would be related to every other 
phase of school work, and discuss one thing as related to every 
other phase of school work, and not try to whip this out in de- 
tail. We have been doing this for fifteen years, and have never 
gotten anywhere. I, for one, am willing to pay my expenses,
-P-A-G-E-281
        JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 281 
and meet one or two weeks, and let us take it like men debating 
a constitution, and work out something from all the experience 
we have got. 
) I believe I am in favor of the resolu- 
tion as offered, asking the chair to appoint three men to report 
on the subject matter as discussed here today. I most heartily 
agree with my good friend Mr. Whitson, and I will go to the 
mountains with him and stay there until we see the promised 
land, just as soon as we do this one job. If we undertake to 
do as much as needs to be done I fear we will not accomplish 
anything, and when we make a good job of this more will be 
added unto us. 
Mr. WHITSON: You will have to reconstruct this when 
you get the other work done. 
Dr. PHILLIPS: It was suggested that this committee be 
extended to five instead of three. 
(—————————_)_I second the motion. 
Mr. TATE: I think three would be better, but I am per- 
fectly willing to have five. 
Dr. PHILLIPS: We want to get a committee that will give 
us a document that will be of service and value to the entire 
Southern States. 
(————————__)_ If you could get them to attend, a com- 
mittee of ten would be better. If you put a man on there he 
ought to promise to attend. 
Dr. PHILLIPS: Will you pardon the chair if he makes any 
error in the appointment of this committee, and he will ap- 
point them right now and here. 
(————————_)_ Question. 
Dr. PHILLIPS: All in favor of this motion signify it by 
saying aye. Carried. 
Dr. PHILLIPS: I will appoint as chairman of that com- 
mittee Dr. Jno. R. Kirk, of Missouri, representing the great 
normal school work of the Southern States. Second on that 
commission— 
Dr. KirK: Now, Mr. Chairman— 
Dr. PHILLIPS: I am appointing the committee, Dr. Kirk.

Adjourned. 
DEPARTMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION. 
PRESIDENT—DR. C. C. THACH, Auburn, Ala. 
SECRETARY—PRoF. WM. H. HAND, Columbia, S. C. 
The Department of Higher Education of the Southern Edu- 
cational Association was called to order at 3 o’clock Friday, Oct. 
81, 1918, by the Chairman, Dr. C. C. Thach, President of the Ala- 
bama Polytechnic Institute, Auburn, Ala. 
Owing to the absence of the Secretary, the Chairman ap- 
pointed Dr. E. M. Poteat, of South Carolina, to serve for the 
meeting. 
The first paper on the program, “Reaching the College Stu- 
dent,”’ was read by Prof. W. G. Perry, Professor of English, Geor- 
gia School of Technology, Atlanta, Ga.

The second paper, “Is There Good Reason for Shortening the 
High School and College Courses?” was read by J. R. Rutland, 
Professor of English, Alabama Polytechnic Institute, Auburn, 
Ala. . 
The meeting was well attended and the discussions were 
spirited and interesting. It was generally conceded that a 
shorter program than usual increased the interest and value of 
the general discussion of papers. 
The following officers were elected for the year 1913-1914: 
Chairman—Prof. J. Hinds, Tennessee. 
Secretary—Prof. J. R. Rutland, Auburn, Ala. 
REACHING THE COLLEGE STUDENT. 
WM. GILMER PERRY, ATLANTA, GA. 
“Reaching the individual student in college classes, and 
maintaining the personal relationship between faculty and stu- 
dent body.” This topic, which has been given into my hands, 
comes so near involving all that is vital and essential in our 
educational system that I approach its discussion with no smail 
diffidence. He must be an optimist indeed who would hope to 
reach a final solution to a problem so complex as this, who 
would hope even to say anything new in connection with a mat- 
ter so much and so ably discussed. I shall feel content if, out 
of my personal observation and experience as a college teacher, 
I can throw upon the dark places of this big problem a light of 
even a very small candle-power. 
A little more than a month ago our college chapels were 
opened for the first time in this term of grace 1913-14. A large 
number of young men sat more or less patiently through many 
very earnest and slightly tedious words of excellent advice from 
presidents, deans, and professors. They were admonished that 
the college is the great training camp for the very real and earn- 
est contests of life; that their campus freedom was beset with 
many and varied temptations; and that properly to equip them- 
selves for their life struggle they must maintain a high earnest- 
ness and preserve their ideals untarnished. Surely no one will 
quarrel with advice as admirable and pertinent as this. College 
life is beset with dangers of many kinds, and no student should 
be permitted to fall into habits of idleness or dissipation without 
a timely warning. Yet this sort of advice seems somehow to
-P-A-G-E-284
  284 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
misplace the emphasis. It contains very much of “Don’t!” and 
very little of “Do!”; and thereby suffers from the defect that 
inheres in all systems of negative ethics; it leads nowhere. Un- 
questionably the most conspicuous fact in the life of the college 
man, especially to the Freshman, is his enormous freedom. The 
common error is in making this‘central fact of his consciousness 
only a starting point of warning and not primarily a source of 
inspiration. We caution him regarding its responsibilities but 
fail to emphasize its opportunities. We make no sufficient ap- 
peal to his imagination. We preach restraint and prudence as if 
through fear that the spirit of aggressiveness will lead only to 
unworthy acts. Yet self-realization and self-assertion are the 
fundamental purpose of the boy’s being at college; and experi- 
ence is the stuff out of which life is spun. The important thing 
for the student is to feel his own latent and growing powers, 
and to comprehend the opportunity for intellectual and spiritual 
expansion that lies before him. This is the note which is too 
often lacking in our advisory talks before college men. 
I have spoken of the college as a preparative for life. This 
in a very real sense it is, and the splendid records and traditions 
of our institutions of higher learning have abundantly justified 
this claim. There is danger that those of us who live much 
within college walls shall forget that it is not, in a conventional 
sense, life itself. The college student lives under a regime highly 
artificial; and even our vocational studies are presented in lab- 
oratories and workshops where conditions differ radically from 
those subsisting in the world’s industrial establishments. Some 
one has suggested that college should be analogous to a trip to 
Europe for the better understanding of America; conditions in 
the two places differ greatly, yet each serves to interpret the 
other. It is not necessary that the student should understand 
the exact relation between the college and the world of affairs; 
but he should be brought to feel that for a few years it is granted 
him to live a life of unusual privileges,—to dwell in a region 
where life is simple and noble, and unmarred by sordid motives 
and devious methods; where ideas and ideals can persist and 
flourish; where he can fit himself to set forth, as any knight of 
old, and remake the world nearer to his heart’s desire. 
If I have seemed a long time winding into my subject, it 
has been because I have felt it needful to give a clear concept 
of what I believe to be the main function of the college; namely, 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 285 
to bring the student to realize the great opportunity for self- 
development as a preparative for his life work, offered under 
conditions peculiarly conducive to a just appraisement of life 
values. I turn now to inquire by what means this realization 
may be brought home to the student,—how in short, we may 
reach the individual student in college classes and maintain a 
proper relation between faculty and student body. 
The center of the problem is to be found in the relation of 
the individual student to the individual professor. No doubt, 
faculties and student bodies alike, as with composite photo- 
graphs, reveal a personality differing from that of any indi- 
vidual member of the group. Yet some college matters are mat- 
ters between Professor A. and Student B.; and even when the 
affair seems to involve the entire group, it can usually be re- 
solved into the simpler relationship. Adjustment and solution 
is rarely far to seek when the individual professor and the in- 
dividual student understand each other. How, then, shall this 
understanding between professor and student be attained? 
There are some things that we may take for granted. For 
one thing, the professor must be master of his subject; he must 
have the student’s respect for and confidence in his scholarship. 
This statement is so self-evident that I shall say no more about. 
it. Nor shall I attempt to comment on the relation between 
professor and student in the presenting of this subject. This 
whole phase of college has been so admirably handled in Pro- 
fessor Phelps’ pleasant little book on “Teaching in Schools and 
Colleges” that further word on my part would savor almost of 
impertinence. I seek rather the realization that lies outside 
the mere function of instruction. 
If education is to mean more than instruction, if it be, to 
use Browning’s phrase, ‘“‘to educe the man,” there is a good deal 
more in teaching than the imparting of knowledge, and the 
professor must be something beyond a man of much learning. 
Our realization of this truth is slightly obscured by the fetich 
our college presidents are just now making of the Ph. D., in the 
emphasis laid upon this qualification of their faculty members 
to the neglect of almost everything else. I hope that here I shall 
not be misunderstood, as undervaluing in any sense the enor- 
mous desirability of the scholarship and training of which the 
doctorate is the badge and sign. I wish only to emphasize the 
fact that the college professor is valuable for other reasons 
   
-P-A-G-E-286
  286 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
than an ability to write books and contribute articles to learned 
publications. In time past we have heard much of Mark Hop- 
kins and the lad seated at the two ends of the log and, to the 
point of sheer weariness, had this picture held before us as the 
ideal educational institution. We have, however, sometimes 
missed the point of the illustration. If we lonk carefully into 
the matter, we shall find the ideal to consist in the fact that at 
one end of the log there is understanding and sympathy, and at 
the other there is respect and confidence. 
Understanding and sympathy is the indispensable part of 
the equipment of the college professor. Of course, penetrating 
and enveloping these, there must be common-sense; but com- 
mon-sense is the gift of the gods, their best gift, and I have no 
prescription for acquiring it. Much of this understanding 
sympathy the professor must gain without external machinery. 
For a satisfactory definition of its meaning, I would refer him 
to A. C. Benson’s two charming volumes, his “Upton Letters” 
and “From a College Window.” As Benson suggests, the suc- 
cessful teacher must have a genuine liking for boys; he must 
make a painstaking and untiring study of boy nature, bringing 
into play heart as well as head; he must know that, though 
there are general types of boy, each youth is a distinct indi- 
vidual with characteristics and problems peculiar to himself; 
he must have unflagging energy and patience, and be able to 
face cheerfully continual disappointment; he must not expect 
any large and striking return for his efforts, not look even for 
appreciation; he must find his reward largely in a conscious- 
ness of faithful and unselfish service. These things he will do 
largely on his own initiative. Yet this is not the whole story; 
else I had no excuse for speaking to you. It is possible to aid 
this individual work through organization; and this, after all, 
is the objective we are seeking. 
As the beginning of this relationship between instructor 
and student is in the lecture room, it is evident that as a first 
requirement, the classes should be small enough for the in- 
structor to have a personal knowledge of every boy in his class, 
although not so small as to destroy that stimulation which arises 
from intellectual competition. The ideal section will number be- 
tween fifteen and twenty-five men. Solely as an aid to efficient in- 
struction this limiting of the size of the class has been recognized 
as so important that schools and colleges, wherever conditions 
permit, are dividing their classes into such smaller units. 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 287 
A second aid toward establishing this relationship is the 
“Adviser System.” This means that every student in the college 
is assigned to some member of the faculty whom he recognizes 
as his personal adviser; and that he is privileged at any time to 
consult this adviser in connection not only with his courses and 
school standing, but with any possible personal difficulty. More- 
over, he consults this adviser not in his capacity as a faculty 
member but as a friend; and these interviews are treated with 
the same respect that the instructor shows the confidences of 
any other friend. Nothing can be more fatal to the suc- 
cess of an adviser system than for facts learned through the 
boy’s confidence to become the general property of the faculty 
meeting. Each instructor has at least one hour a week when he 
is accessible to any student, and this hour is as definitely known 
as any that is allotted to recitation. Such is the general plan. 
This Adviser System is not a new thing. It has been at- 
tempted in a large number of schools and colleges; and frank- 
ness demands the admission that its success has frequently been 
doubtful. I have, nonetheless, not lost faith in its possible ef- 
fectiveness. Where it has proved a failure, the fault, so far as 
I have been able to learn, is traceable to the instructor rather 
than to the student. Its working involves, for the professor, no 
small tedium; hence, he is likely to do little toward encouraging 
the student’s confidence and, when interviewed, to appear indif- 
ferent or curt. Even when he has interest, his own fineness of 
feeling will often lead him to misinterpret the boy’s constitu- 
tional reticence in the presence of his elders and to fail in the 
supplying of that unusual encouragement which is needed to 
make a boy talk about himself. A final difficulty may arise from 
a lack of the tact which will enable the adviser to know just 
where information-seeking becomes impertinence. 
This last difficulty may be met in some slight degree by col- 
lecting at the school office certain general facts respecting the 
student. For example, we may learn whether the boy’s parents 
are living, what is his father’s vocation, what religious af- 
filiation he has. These facts, which are entirely legitimate con- 
cern of the institution, may be gathered at the time of registra- 
tion, and should be kept in easily accessible form. Other ways 
of getting information about the student will constantly suggest 
themselves to the alert teacher. We express concern at our 
friend’s absence from some social gathering and speak our pleas- 
    
-P-A-G-E-288
  288 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
ure at his recovery from an illness. I have wondered why we 
cannot show a like courtesy to our student when he has failed to 
be present at our classes. I have wondered, too, at the unconcern 
with which we turn over to committees and deans the investigat- 
ing of causes for a student’s real or seeming neglect of our sub- 
ject. We do not consider how often a show of personal interest 
in these matters might be both the first step toward a better 
understanding between instructor and student and even an in- 
strument for working a complete change in the student’s attitude 
toward his work. All this should carefully avoid the appearance 
of “nagging”; it should be done in a frankly, friendly spirit. 
Above all else, however, every suggestion of sentimentality must 
be rigidly excluded. A normal American boy resents nothing so 
quickly as any savor of mawkishness; nothing so promptly rouses 
his contempt. I beg that I shall not be thought to offer these 
methods as a substitute for discipline; they merely supplement 
discipline. If they do not fit within the strict requirements of 
scholarship, attendance, and general conduct, then there is some- 
thing radically wrong with our discipline. 
A third instrument through the faculty and student may be 
brought to a better understanding is the Committee on Student 
Affairs. I am not one of those who believe athletics, college pub- 
lications, social entertainments, and fraternities to be excre- 
escences on college life. I esteem them, indeed, an integral part 
of this life, agencies for the ‘educing of the whole man’ which I 
believe is the purpose of the college. They should exist, but 
should exist under careful and intelligent faculty supervision. I 
doubt whether there is any phase of college administration 
characterized by more well intentioned and more unwise legis- 
lation than these same extra-scholastic activities. A depressing 
ignorance appears in much of our management of them. All 
these things are big with as much potential good as potential 
harm. We seldom consider, for example, how large an instru- 
ment for good we might make the close bond of the college fra- 
ternity ; how, by getting hold of the two or three leading men in 
each chapter, we influence without effect a score of other boys. 
What the faculty needs is more light; and this additional light 
it is the purpose of the Committee on Student Affairs to pro- 
cure. 
The constitution of this committee is an important matter; it 
should contain the best men on the faculty. Its chairman should
-P-A-G-E-289
       289 
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 
be the professor best fitted by temperament and experience to 
win the confidence of the students and to advise them wisely. 
Every college faculty is the rich possessor of at least one such 
old headed and young hearted member. His associates, as far 
as possible, should be chosen for like reasons. The function of 
this committee will be to investigate the effect of the various 
student activities on scholarship; to advise with student boards 
and individuals; to check extravagance and waste, whether of 
money or time; and they will furnish encouragement as well 
as restraint. In most matters under their supervision they will 
have authority to act for the faculty. Their work will be of 
increased efficiency if it be possible to divide this supervision 
still further, and give to each member of the committee direc- 
tion of the one particular student activity with which he is 
especially competent to deal. 
If much of what I have said seems trivial, I shall only say 
that attention to the minutie makes the success of college ad- 
ministration. 
I have been looking so long at one end of the log whereon 
sit Mark Hopkins and the boy that I have but little time to 
glance at the other where are found respect and confidence. I 
have assumed as a sine qua non the student’s respect and con- 
fidence in his instructor’s scholarship; equally I shall assume a 
respect and confidence in his character and moral integrity. 
There is needed, however, one thing more: the student must 
feel the mental breadth of his professor. The caricature of the 
teacher represents him as grossly ignorant of all life lying out- 
side of his own peculiar field of research; as narrow and auto- 
cratic; as devoid of those humanizing qualities and interests 
that belong to the man of affairs. Such a picture does a violent 
injustice to the profession; and, if such a type once existed, 
the whole modern drift is in the opposite direction. The case 
of the teacher is peculiarly difficult. His field of research is so 
vast and difficult of even partial mastery, that many matters of 
general interest must be sacrificed; moreover, a constant con- 
tact with less mature minds makes a deadly attack on his sense 
of proportion and perspective. It requires a continual strug- 
gle on his part to escape these dangers; yet failure to escape 
them means mental atrophy. He must know something of 
what is going on about him as revealed in the newspapers and 
magazines; he must follow with some understanding the great 
19 . 
   
-P-A-G-E-290
  290 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
current of contemporary thought; hard worked as he is, he 
should have some work of serious intellectual activity not defi- 
nitely connected with his classroom lectures. Otherwise he is 
drifting toward mental stagnation. Nor is he thus only win- 
ning a larger respect for his students; he is establishing a plane 
of common interest whereon he and the student may meet freely 
and without embarrassment. No assumption is more false than 
the college man is incapable of any ideas other than those sup- 
plied by his dances and football and “Saturday Evening Post.” 
He frequently knows a great deal of what is happening in the 
outside world; he is readily interested in the larger activities of 
his century, and shows a surprising eagerness to learn of the 
great social and religious movements that characterize this age. 
The teacher who is vividly aware of the great world about him 
is not merely the teacher with the richest personal life; he is 
the teacher who will come nearest winning the confidence of 
his student and fitting that student for the world struggles into 
which he is so soon to enter. 
In closing I repeat that these comments cannot hope to be 
more than suggestive; universal solvents of any kind whatso- 
ever are exceedingly rare. Moreover, every college has its own 
traditions and local conditions that may modify or even make 
impracticable much that I have said. Finally, the conclusion 
of this whole matter lies, after all, in a sentence that I recall of 
Professor Phelps’: 
“TI love to teach,” he writes. “I love to teach as a painter 
loves to paint, as a musician loves to play, as a singer loves to 
sing, as a strong man rejoices to run a race. ... The main aim 
of my happy days has been to become a good teacher.” 
Where this spirit exists, the answer to the problem is not 
far to seek; and where it is lacking, I can hope for but scant 
increase, let Paul plant and Apollos water never so faithfully. 
SHORTENING THE CURRICULA. 
J. R. RUTLAND, AUBURN, ALA. 
Probably the most striking single development in the last 
half a century of our educational history is the increase in 
number and scope of public secondary schools. The curriculum 
has been greatly enriched and enlarged by the introduction of 
subjects not previously taught in school and many formerly
-P-A-G-E-291
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 291 
taught only in the colleges. In response to this growth, our 
colleges have raised their entrance requirements and their cur- 
ricula, so that it is no longer possible for a young Jonathan 
Edwards to enter college at the age of thirteen and get his 
A. B. degree at the age of seventeen or for little John Trum- 
bull to pass with credit his entrance examinations at Yale ai 
the age of seven. He may not enter school before the age of 
six or seven and then he must proceed through eight (seven in 
some Southern States) years of elementary school and four of 
high school before he can be a full fledged college student. If, 
after his four years in college, he wishes to enter a professional 
school for law, medicine, or the ministry, he has yet four (in 
some instances three) more years of school training ahead of 
him. If he has lost no time, he may enter the practice of his 
profession at the age of twenty-six or twenty-seven. Such a 
long course of study puts adequate professional training be- 
yond the reach of many who ought to get it and defers too long 
the age of self-support. Few would question the actual value 
of the new courses in our high school curriculum, but many 
serious students of the situation believe that much can be left 
out without vital loss. Since the elementary and high schools 
of today consume so much of the child’s time as consumed by 
the elementary school, academy, and college in the days of Cot- 
ton Mather and John Trumbull, we may ask whether our high 
school graduates are as well trained or proficient as were the 
classmates of these gentlemen at Harvard and Yale. Probably 
we teach a more varied course, but is the product as good? It 
may be seriously questioned also whether we have raised our 
college curriculum as fast as we have raised our entrance re- 
quirements. It seems indubitably true that our colleges do not 
give sufficient recognition to high school work and that there 
is considerable duplication of work. It is due to these consid- 
erations, the irrelevancy to the needs of life of much that we 
teach, the overlapping of curricula, and the long time required 
of our educational process, that the question of “Waste in our 
Curricula” and “Economy in Education” are prominent topics 
at our educational meetings.

The National Educational Association committee investi- 
gating the wastage in our curricula reported in 1912 that they 
had decided that two years could be saved by careful elimina- 
tion and by better organization of material. Six years are as- 
signed to the elementary school instead of eight; six years to 
the high school which will include the first two years of the 
present college curriculum; and six years to the college and to 
the professional courses. I presume that the eliminations of 
topics and studies necessitated by this scheme will be distributed 
all along the whole course. While such a system is growing up, 
students may leave the high school at the end of the fourth year 
and enter the freshman class at college or may finish the high 
school and enter the junior class at college or go into business. 
The six-year high school, having two years of college work, has 
already been established in California in some towns at a great 
distance from Leland Stanford and the university. This ar-
-P-A-G-E-293
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 293 
rangement allows boys and girls to stay at home two more 
years—a very desirable one on account of the age of the stu- 
dents and the expense—and will finally, President Jordan says, 
make it possible for the colleges to confine themselves entirely 
to college work. The fact that there is a similarity between 
high school work and the work of the first two years in col- 
lege, as both consist of general praparation for the intensive 
. specialization demanded by the last two years of college, makes 
the success of this experiment assured. This change will make 
our high schools somewhat like the gymnasium of Germany. 
As to reducing the elementary school from eight to six years, 
it may be said that in many states in the South we have elim- 
inated the eighth elementary grade entirely and have intro- 
duced high school methods into the seventh grade, an arrange- 
ment nearly in harmony with the recommendations of the 
N. E. A. committee. The practice school at the School of Edu- 
eation of the University of Chicago, has found by actual ex- 
periment that both of these changes are practicable. I am in- 
clined to agree with President Judson that still another year 
may be eliminated from the elementary school without serious 
injury. In fact, it is quite generally felt that the children of 
the earlier grades could be let alone a little more with much 
profit to themselves. If this belief should prove a verity, it is 
likely that our educational leaders will find that more than two 
years may be eliminated from the whole period of our educa- 
tional process. 
If we compare the average age of our graduates with those 
from European schools, we will find that our students are from 
two to four years older. According to a publication of the 
United States Bureau of Education, entitled Present Stand- 
ards of Higher Education in the United States, we find that the 
average age of graduates from medical schools in France is 
23 years; in Germany, 23; in England, 23; Netherlands, 24; 
and Switzerland, 23. On the other hand, as the President of 
the Council of Medical Education of the United States noted 
two years ago, the average of medical candidates in 1912 at 
Western Reserve was 27.9; at Harvard, 27.2; at Rush Medical 
College, 27; University of California, 27; at Johns Hopkins, 
26.4; at Cornell, 26.4. As Johns Hopkins, Harvard, and West- 
ern Reserve require a bachelor’s degree or four years of college 
work and then a four-year medical course, the students must 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
  294 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
have been 19 or 20 before entering college. As the Rush Med- 
ical College course requires only six years of college and med- 
ical work, the candidate must have been fully 21 before enter- 
ing. Theoretically, medical students should finish the college 
and professional courses at the age of 25 or 26; really they 
finish upwards of 27. This means that graduates in medicine 
from our best universities are four years older than graduates 
from European universities. Yet, I suppose no one would claim 
that our medical graduates are superior in training or culture 
to those in Germany, France, or England. Though the figures 
are not at hand, I believe that on investigation, the average of 
the graduates of our best law and divinity schools and of our 
candidates for doctorate of philosophy will be found not much, 
if any, lower than that of the medical graduates. Here I do 
not take into consideration the short course in law given in a 
summer term, or based on a high school course, or a few weeks’ 
reading in a country lawyer’s office. If this comparison of ages 
of graduates of our schools with those of European schools is a 
fair one, one of two conclusions is inevitable: Either our boys 
and girls need a longer process of training than German or Eng- 
lish boys and girls to acquire an equivalent proficiency or they 
are required to remain at school too long. I know no reason 
why an American student needs four more years of school train- 
ing for a degree in medicine, or approximately one-sixth of the 
whole period of school attendance, than is necessary for the 
Swiss or the Dutch students. Our schools should be as efficient 
as any in the world. 
Turning to the lower schools we find that the average age 
of graduates from the German gymnasium is between 18 and 
19. The gymnasium course is on the whole practically equiva- 
lent, in content at least, to a course in one of our high schools 
together with the first two years in our colleges. Theoret- 
ically, our boys and girls should leave the high school at the 
age of 18; practically they enter college at 19 or over or the 
age at which the German student has completed, so far as time 
is concerned, the equivalent of half of our college course. 
As a result of the long tenure of school days, the young 
man who aspires to the doctorate of philosophy or who be- 
comes a physician, lawyer, or minister, enters the practice of 
his profession somewhere between the ages of 26 and 30; and 
when he has established himself so that he and perhaps his 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 295 
family can live comfortably, he is thirty or more years old. 
This is particularly hard on Harvard men, as Dr. Eliot advises 
a man to marry when he is 21 and when his bride is 19. But 
complaint comes from another quarter. The faculties of pro- 
fessional schools say that they would like to receive their stu- 
dents when they are younger and when their minds are more 
elastic, more energetc, more adaptable. As fingers and minds 
are more pliable at 19 or 20 than at 22 or 23, there is a decided 
advantage in specializing at the earlier ages. But these con- 
siderations do not take into account those students who are 
shut out from these professions because they cannot afford the 
cost of such a long course; or those who leave the high school 
or the first two years of college because the courses seem aim- 
less and uninteresting. We will find that by giving our boys 
the vocational incentive and some of the special training sooner, 
that we can persuade more of them to continue in schools and 
that the average proficiency at the end will be greater. The 
question of the length and cost of a course of study affects a. 
very large per cent. of our students. 
I think that we may agree with the N. E. A. committee in 
saying that at least two years can be saved. If students in 
European schools finish the secondary course two years sooner 
and the professional courses three or more years sooner than 
students can finish ours and are equally well educated, then our 
schools are not as efficient as they ought to be. If these extra 
years, with the extra expense makes a full course impossible 
for the needy, discouraging to the practical-minded, and dis- 
advantageous to the specialist, we should cut them off. There 
must be eliminations; and such eliminations as will raise, not 
lower, the quality of instruction or the standards of graduation. 
But how and what to eliminate is a disturbing question. In 
an address before the N. E. A. in 1904, on the subject of the 
omissions advisable in the present elementary and secondary 
curricula, Dr. F. M. McMurry of Columbia University laid down 
these four principles for the rejection of subject matter: It 
must have a plain relation to some real need; it must be within 
the child’s comprehension; it should appeal to his interests; it 
must not consist of irrelevant details isolated from their places 
in a chain of ideas. In accordance with these principles he 
found that about half of arithmetic can be omitted without 
serious loss; grammar can be completed in one year instead of 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
296 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
the two or more given to it now. By omitting the study of the 
causes of the tides and seasons and shortening the time spent 
in detailed study of Asia, Australia, and Africa and other topics 
of equal or less value, we can save a year in geography. By a 
better organization of subject matter we can give in history, 
nature study, and other subjects better training in less time. 
For the past few years we have been so eager to enrich our 
course of study, into which nearly every conceivable propa- 
ganda has tried to thrust itself, that we have admitted some 
material that is merely incidental—good to know and to train 
young minds with but superfluous in a course of study. In 
other words, our course can be made more coherent. If we 
apply these tests to all subjects in our curricula, we can strike 
out a good deal without harm. As has often been said, it is 
very likely that we can get more educational value out of fewer 
things taught for a longer time and with more effective drill 
and repetition. Through better organization of vital material, 
the elimination of the irrelevant, and an increase of the effi- 
ciency of our teachers, we should be able to save two years, 
and very likely more, in the elementary and high schools. 
However, there is another element of waste. Due to the 
lack of sharp demarcation between high school and elementary 
school and between high school and college, there has come 
about a decided overlapping of courses at both points. Eng- 
lish, history, geography, and other subjects taken up in the 
elementary schools are carried over into the high school. Both 
schools sometimes pay very little attention to what is done in 
the other. Consequently, the high school often repeats what 
has already been given and the elementary school attempts to 
teach what is above the heads of its pupils and belongs to the 
high school. 
There is little reason in teaching formal grammar a year 
or more in the elementary school where much of it cannot be 
well taught, and then, as is often the case, reviewing it at two 
different periods in the high school, and possibly a fourth time 
in college. As a matter of fact we should get some of this 
grammar through a foreign language taught in the elementary 
school. It is generally conceded that the study of language 
should be begun earlier in the course. The practice school of 
the Department of Education of the University of Chicago has 
found that it is practicable to begin Latin, French, or German 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 297 
in the fourth and fifth grades of the elementary schools. Ele- 
mentary work in history, which is taken up in the seventh or 
eighth grades of the elementary school, is taught over again in 
the high high school and a third time in college. It is not 
claimed that all this reviewing is unnecessary; but that a bet- 
ter codperation between the teachers of the college and of the 
schools will help eliminate a good deal of it. Proper adjust- 
ment here will prevent waste. 
It now remains to see whether we can save time between 
the high school and the college. It is certainly true that our 
colleges are doing secondary school work, which should be left 
to the high school. Here I am not speaking of work done in 
those colleges that have not bounced into the Carnegie four- 
teen-unit band-wagon. Prof. J. R. Angell of the University of 
Chicago says that one-third of the courses of many students 
who graduate at the University of Chicago should be given as 
well in the high school. President Judson said last month at 
the Educational Conference of Secondary Schools, “We are do- 
ing university work in the last two college years and secondary 
school work in the first two college years.” The truth of the 
matter is that we have raised our entrance requirements faster 
that we have raised our college curricula. Before the secondary 
school became so popular, freshmen were required to know a 
little Latin, a little Greek, a little mathematics, and perhaps a 
little English grammar—all of which could be acquired by 
plodders in two or three years. In fact, the entrance require- 
ments at Oxford and Cambridge and even at West Point and 
Annapolis now are not very far in advance of this. Now, al- 
though our high schools are doing much of that preparatory 
work which the college had formerly to do for itself and al- 
though we recognize this in our higher entrance requirements, 
the colleges and universities are still giving many of those old 
secondary courses of all round education. But, it may be asked, 
what is secondary school work? In reply to this question, Dr. 
Judson in the address already referred to, says, “Secondary 
school work is work which is elementary. Take it in French. 
You begin French and teach a couple of years that belong to the 
secondary school. There is no earthly reason why this should 
. be taught in college. The same is true of German. We are 
teaching history to freshmen but it is done in high schools and 
may be done quite as well there as in college. The thing easily        
-P-A-G-E-298
   
       298 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
runs up to a quarter or a third of college work which is essen- 
tially secondary school work.” 
Let us be more specific. In a recent article in The School 
Review, Prof. F. D. Crawshaw of the University of Wisconsin 
argues rightly that it is unfair for colleges to count for advanced 
standing in manual training as they now do, two hours of high 
school work simply as the eqivalent of one hour in the same 
course at college. Prof. Angell in the January, 1913, number 
of The School Review says that colleges frankly offer element- 
ary courses in English which traverse ground substantially 
identical with that covered in the lower schools. A glance at 
our college catalogues, which some one has called a most pop- 
ular branch of modern fiction, will show elementary courses in 
composition and rhetoric, debating, general views of English 
and American literatures, which in the main are new presenta- 
tions of material which is or should be given in the high school. 
The story of the young man who was confronted with the beau- 
ties of Evangeline six different times in his school and college 
career is not at all improbable. It was found by a questionaire 
conducted through some eighteen colleges and universities of 
the Middle West that 72 per cent. assign students prepared in 
biology to classes with students unprepared; that 90 per cent. 
failed to recognize any duplication of work; and that all re- 
fused to recognize one-half year courses. In defense of this it 
is commonly argued that colleges are compelled to do this work 
over because it is poorly done in the high school. Although in 
many instances this may be true, the colleges are inconsistent 
to allow one or two units credit for elementary work in any 
subject and then require the students presenting them to go 
into courses with those who have not had previous training in 
the subject. 
This question was quite well discussed last April by the 
conference with secondary schools, University of Chicago. The 
reports seem to show, among other things, that high school 
work in geography and physiography does not help the student at 
all when he pursues the college course; that there are many 
topics of slight value in these subjects that might well be omit- 
ted; that much time could be saved by eliminating certain topics 
from high school mathematics and by teaching algebra, geom- 
etry, and trigonometry as a unified subject; that in English 
many high schools attempt technical work which the children 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 299 
cannot appreciate. But there was no agreement reached as to 
what should be repeated and what cut out. The history teach- 
ers voted a resolution that it was desirable for the average 
pupil who has taken European history in the high school to 
repeat it in college, but that some device by which the excep- 
tional student may be excused should be adopted. It was em- 
phasized again and again at the conference that college work, 
as compared with high school work, is on a higher plane; that 
the college emphasizes the “why” instead of the “what” and 
aims to cultivate judgment and the scientific habit; and that 
the duplication, which is often confined to subject matter, does 
not always represent waste. Although there is a good deal of 
truth in this, why should we teach a subject in the high school 
at all if it is necessary for a student to start again at the be- 
ginning when he enters college? If a subject cannot be taught 
well in the high school, it should not be attempted; if the work 
there is now poorly done we can and must improve it. Either 
way we can save time. 
The resolution about repeating European history might be 
made about almost any other subject in the curriculum. Of 
course the pupils get a new insight into it the second time. So 
does one get a new and clearer point of view on all things the 
older he grows. Such argument might hold good for a third 
or a fourth review. The aim of school training is not so much 
to give information as to give skill and culture; and skill, cul- 
ture, and the scientific habit of mind, can be secured through 
new subjects which will still further widen the student’s hori- 
zon, just as well as through reviews, and perhaps better. 
It should be clear that the argument presented here does 
not consider for one moment that an inferior quality of school 
work or lower standards of graduation requirements are desir- 
able. On the contrary, the facts brought forward indicate that 
a school course which is as good as ours, and possibly better, 
can be given in two years less time. The fact that better sal- 
aries, better teachers, better organization and supervision are 
needed to hasten the day of reform has only been implied be- 
cause it seemed evident enough. This paper takes for granted 
that American schools can and should be as efficient as Euro- 
pean schools which manage to finish the school course two or 
more years sooner than we. It seems probable that the desired 
saving of time can be secured by eliminating from our cur-
-P-A-G-E-300
    300 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
ricula some of the less important subjects, many unessential 
topics in necessary subjects, and many needless duplications 
in work running through two or all three of our school divi- 
sions. 
What steps are to be taken to improve conditions remains 
yet to be determined. The University of Chicago saves one 
year in four for those regular students who attend the summer 
session. At Harvard the bachelor’s degree may be taken in 
three years. Harvard, Columbia, Indiana, and other universi- 
ties allow students who are going to take professional courses 
to omit the fourth college year and confer the bachelor’s de- 
gree after the completion of the first year of the professional 
course. There are other less creditable means of shortening 
the course, but none meet the situation quite so satisfactorily. 
The right solution must deal with the problem in the high 
school and the elementary school as well as in the college. It 
seems to me that teachers in all three sections of our educa- 
tional system should set themselves the definite task of finding 
out how we can eliminate the unessential from our separate 
curricula, how we can organize the rest into a more coherent 
whole, and how by improved methods and through better in- 
sight into the means and ends of the educational process we 
can give better training in a shorter time. In the second place, 
we need some intelligent collaboration between school and col- 
lege teachers in the work of finding out exactly what duplica- 
tions are desirable and what are needless and how we can get 
rid of the needless. Then, when we have found out what we 
ought to do—in this case it ought not to take us very long—let 
us pray that our nerve may not fail us in doing it right away. 
WOMAN’S DEPARTMENT. 
PRESIDENT—MRS. CORA WILSON STEWART, Morehead, Ky. 
SECRETARY—MRs. CHAS. WATERS BAKER, Nashville, Tenn. 
The Woman’s Department of the Southern Educational As- 
sociation met at the High School Building, Nashville, Tenn., 
Friday, October 31, at 2:30 p. m. 
The president of the Woman’s Department, Mrs. Cora Wil- 
son Stewart opened the meeting and stated that in arranging 
the program she had assembled talent from four great Southern 
States, namely, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and Kentucky,
-P-A-G-E-301
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 301 
and that she had selected the woman whom she deemed most 
able to handle the given subject. 
The first number on the program was a paper, Woman in 
the Rural Schools, by Mrs. Hetty Browne, Principal of the 
Model Rural School Winthrop Normal and Industrial College, 
Rock Hill, S. C. This paper was a most excellent one and proved 
that the advantages of the rural school are many and that such 
a. school may be made a strong factor in community life. 
Miss Martha Berry, principal of Berry School, Rome, Ga., 
was unavoidably absent and the department was deprived of 
the pleasure of hearing her paper on Woman’s Share in the 
Development of the Private School. 
Miss Sara E. Luther, Professor of English in the State 
Normal School, Troy, Ala., was the next to appear on the pro- 
gram and gave a forceful and eloquent address on Woman as 
a Factor in the Normal School. 
Dr. Irene T. Myers, Dean of Women, Transylvania Uni- 
versity, Lexington, Ky., in a clear, logical and concise paper on 
Woman’s Work in Colleges brought to a close one of the most 
excellent and helpful programs ever rendered at a woman’s 
meeting in Nashville. 
On motion of the Secretary a vote of thanks was tendered 
Mrs. Stewart, Mrs. Berry, Miss Luther and Dr. Myers for the 
splendid program, after which the meeting adjourned. 
WOMAN IN THE RURAL SCHOOLS. 
MRS. HETTY BROWNE, ROCK HILL, S. C. 
Let us consider for a moment who is meant by this word 
woman. Is it only those who live in the rural districts or can it 
be the city dweller as well? Is it those whose interests are tied 
up with the tillers of the soil or those whose interests are re- 
motely related to the soil that there seems to be no relation at 
all. Is it this busy housewife and mother who is so engaged in 
her work as to leave no time for thinking out problems, and 
who is so close to the real problem that it is impossible for her 
to get far enough away to see it from all sides, and whose life 
and feelings are so wound up with the work that she is doing 
as to render an unprejudiced view impossible? Or is the 
woman, although she may be city bred, who has leisure for at- 
tending lectures, reading and thinking. Can her theories on
-P-A-G-E-302
  302 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
rural life problems make up for the loss of the practical part? 
Perhaps the woman is the fresh young normal graduate who 
comes out to teach the country school for a few months to gain 
enough experience to get what she considers a better position. 
It is all of these and more too. It is the busy woman and 
the woman of leisure. It is the country bred and the city bred. 
It is the mother and it is the teacher. In fact it is you and I. 
We are the women who have a duty to perform to the rural 
school. 
But, the housewife protests that there is nothing for her 
to do. She knows only the round of busy household cares. But, 
does she not make beautiful bread? She can teach the children 
in the rural school and her neighbors in the mothers’ meetings 
how to do this. Here is another housekeeper who makes ex- 
cellent butter. She can teach others to do this. There is al- 
ways some one in the neighborhood who does some one thing 
better than anyone else in the neighborhood. Let her teach the 
other women of the neighborhood to do this and in return they 
will teach her what they know. Each one will be doubly blessed. 
She will get information from her sisters and in giving her in- 
struction to them will get something of educational value. 
Here is the woman who has visions of the big things in 
country life. She is far enough removed to see the problem 
from all sides and in an unbiased way. She is a treasure at 
the mothers’ meetings, farmers’ institutes and school improve- 
ment associations. If she is from the city or town so much 
more does she owe the country some of her time and energy. 
The cities and towns have grown at the expense of the open 
country. The most progressive young men and young women 
have responded to the call of the town or city. It has been 
thought that if a body has no particular aptitude for anything 
that he.can farm. We hope soon to change this. We need 
our best men on the farm. There is just as great an opportun- 
ity for advancement there as elsewhere. Statistics show that 
those farmers who have made a study of agriculture are getting 
splendid incomes from the farm. Now our city bred woman 
can preach this gospel of “stay on the farm.” She can help 
the farmer and his wife to get pleasure from life through 
socials, debating societies, and the like. 
Before we consider the work of the teacher in the rural 
school let us define our ideal of the rural school. What are
-P-A-G-E-303
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 303 
we to expect from it? There it sits in utter neglect for one- 
half of the year and only partly cared for the other six months. 
Can it become a vital force in our community? What do we 
expect it to accomplish? The first change that I should have 
made is that the whole atmosphere of the school should be 
different. It should fairly reek with the love of country and 
country life. The child’s ears should be attuned to hear the 
musical sounds of nature all around—the cricket in the grass, 
the birds in the tree-tops, the whistle of the partridge from the 
stubble field, the tinkle of bells from the pasture and the call of 
the farmer to his team as he turns the fallow ground. There 
should be a thrill of pleasure as he takes in deep draughts of 
pure, fresh, country air. The smell of the rain on the dusty 
road, of fresh-mown hay in the meadow, of ripening fruits by 
the roadside, and a hundred other such odors should become a 
part of his very being. He should be taught to see and appre- 
ciate the beauties of nature spread out so lavishly before him. 
The revolving seasons should mean more to him than they do 
to the city child. Walt Whitman has written a little poem 
that expresses this so well that I must quote it: 
THERE WAS A CHILD WENT FORTH. 
There was a child went forth every day, 
And the first object he look’d upon, that object he became, 
And that object became part of him for the day or a certain part of the day, 
Or for many years and stretching cycles of years. 
The early lilacs became part of this child, 
And the grass, and the white and red morning-glories, and white and red 
clover, and the song of the phoebe bird, 
And the water-plants with their graceful flat heads all became part of him. 
And the apple trees covered with blossoms, and the fruit afterward, and 
wood-berries, and the commonest weeds by the road, 
And the school-mistress that pass’d on her way to school, 
And the friendly boys that pass’d, and the quarrelsome boys, 
And the tidy and fresh-cheeked girls, and the barefoot boy and girl, 
And all the changes of city and country wherever he went, 
These all became part of that child who went forth every day and who now 
goes, and will always go forth every day. 
The school should dignify the occupation of the farmer. 
The child should honor and respect the men in his community 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  304 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
who are tilling the soil. There should be a healthy optimistic 
feeling about the occupation of farming. Better days are 
ahead. All must help them to come quickly. 
A few months ago I attended the closing exercises of a 
country school and among the recitations was one called “No 
Room for the Moneyless Man.” A fine lad of fifteen recited it. 
As I sat there tingling with the injustice of it all, I could 
scarcely keep from rising to my feet and saying, “Yes, boys, 
there is room for the moneyless man. A bright mind and good, 
strong, willing hands are all that are needed. That teacher in 
allowing the boy to memorize such a selection has not only 
done the boy an irreparable injustice, but the entire com- 
munity as well. How much better if he had memorized this 
poem written by Dr. L. H. Birley: 
“Blow ye winds and lay on ye storms, 
And come ye pests in rabble swarms, 
And fall ye blights in legion forms— 
I am here; I surrender not, 
Nor yield my place one piece or jot: 
For these are my lands, 
And these are my hands, 
And I am bone of the folk that resistlessly stands. 
“The blood of old ploughmen runs hard in my arm. 
Of ax men and yeomen and battle men all, 
Who fought and who flinched not by marish and wall, 
‘Who met the bold day and chased every alarm: 
My father—kind sleep, but I hear the old call, 
And fight the hot battles by forge and by farm: 
For these are my lands, 
And these are my hands, 
And I om bone of the folk that resistlessly stands.” 
The study of Agriculture will help to get the right atti- 
tude towards the soil. When a farmer knows that deep plow- 
ing and keeping a dust mulch will help his crops to stand a 
drought he will not take time to grumble but keep on with the 
cultivation of his crops. When a farmer knows the worth of 
his farm products and the value of codperation in marketing 
them he will feel that he, too, is a man able to cope with any 
one. 
Butterfield says, “The well educated farmer will then be 
. trained in three lines of thought: first, that which deals with
-P-A-G-E-305
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 305 
the growth of products; second, that which deals with the sell- 
ing of products; and, third, that which deals with agriculture 
as an industry and farmers as a class of people.” 
Not only should our schools give work in elementary agri- 
culture or nature study, but there should be also some instruc- 
tion in manual training and home economics. I do not want 
you to think that I would add anything more to our already 
over-crowded curriculum. These things can be correlated with 
the subjects already taught in such a way that no extra time 
will be required for them. The things that bring joy and happi- 
ness into the country—music and games—should be cultivated, 
too. 
I shall close this topic of the Aim of the Country School 
with two quotations. The first is by Dr. L. H. Bailey: ‘The 
ultimate object of education by means of agriculture is to re- 
direct country life. The re-direction of country life rests on 
two corner stones, which are improved farming and improved 
home-making. If it is essential that the man be trained in bet- 
ter farming methods it is equally essential that the woman be 
trained in better household methods.” 
The second is by H. W. Foght in his book, “The American 
Rural School”: “The school of tomorrow will teach the farm 
child how to live and how to do things. The teacher of tomor- 
row must be able to take the child in its own little world along 
the pathway of life, directing its native adaptabilities, senti- 
ments, and powers; he must develop in the child’s breast a 
sympathy with its environment, and in the child’s mind an 
understanding of nature and nature’s intent. The teacher must 
lead the child to see in the old farmstead with its God-given 
acres the most precious heritage that can come to mortal man. 
He must teach the child that the farm is his treasure, then 
there will his heart be also.” 
The building that should house this vitalized school should 
be worthy of it. Instead of the usual position in an old field 
by the side of the road with no trees near, it should have the 
best site in the neighborhood—in easy access to all, elevated 
enough to command a view of the surrounding country but not 
high enough to be cold or bleak in winter. There should be 
several acres of ground attached to the school—some to be used 
as individual garden plots, some as a field for experimental and 
demonstration purposes, and a generous amount given over to 
2» 
   
-P-A-G-E-306
  306 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
play grounds, for both boys and girls. Trees should be placed 
in such a way as to form a background for the buildings and to 
give shade to the play grounds. The bold, hard outlines of the 
house should be softened by means of vines and shrubs. The 
building itself should bear more resemblance to a dwelling than 
to that of the accepted school house. It should consist of sev- 
eral rooms, one large enough for all to assemble and used as a 
school room, one as a carpenter shop, and one as a kitchen. 
I should like to see the plan carried out here that is work- 
ing so well on the continent of Europe, that of the teacher liv- 
ing in a suite of rooms in the second story of the school build- 
ing. Of course such a school would have to consist of more 
than one teacher. 
Now who shall be the teacher of this country school? Very 
often she is merely a transient. She comes out from the city 
and teaches until she can secure a position in the city schools. 
Usually she is poorly paid, inexperienced and the labor of 
school absorbs all of her time and energy. 
The teacher of our new school must be a leader. She should 
love the open country and understand the country community. 
She should also have some knowledge of the problems the farmer 
has to face and some appreciation of the peculiar conditions of 
farm life. 
Her position as teacher of the school, as director of the chil- 
dren implies that she is something of a leader. Those in the com- 
munity look to the school and to her for leadership without jeal- 
ousy or criticism. In this connection Miss Mabel Carney says: 
“No person or group of persons can control the local rural situa- 
tion and guide the trend of thought as can the country teacher, if 
she is adequately prepared and knows how to attack her problem. 
Her influence can be more direct than that of any distant agri- 
cultural college, experiment station or commission.” 
The teacher must find a way to help not only those children 
who are in school under her daily instruction but the other chil- 
dren in the neighborhood who are in school for only a few 
months in the year. These boys and girls have to help on the 
farm. The formation of corn and tomato clubs is one solution of 
this problem. The pupil comes to the school for instruction, 
does his work at home and comes back to the school to report re- 
sults. The teacher suggests and encourages him to read the books 
and bulletins that contain information about growing the crop
-P-A-G-E-307
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 307 
in which he is interested. In this way the boy or girl is gaining 
something educationally the year round. 
The school should not only instruct those of school age but 
should reach out to those who have reached the adult stage. We 
all honor the president of this department for the wonderful 
work she and her faithful teachers have done and are still doing 
for the people of Rowan County, Kentucky. 
Every community brings its own problems. In some it 
might be possible to have short courses in agriculture and do- 
mestic science in the evenings for the adults of the neighborhood. 
The library is another way in which the school can reach the 
home. A reading room could be kept open evenings with a small 
amount of trouble and expense. Debating societies, singing 
schools and the like are helpful in getting the people together. 
But helpful as these are there should be an organization for 
the educational value there is in it. If it is well managed each 
person in the community will find that there is some work for 
him or her to do. The ability to do team work will be developed. 
This organization may take the form of a school inmprovement 
league, a farmers’ institute, home-maker’s league, teachers’ and 
patron’s association, or any other society that is suggested by the 
needs of the community. 
The teachers’ and patrons’ association has been known as 
the Hesperia Movement, so called from the town where it orig- 
inated. The idea here was that the patrons and teachers worked 
together for the upbuilding of the community. It brought the 
teacher and parent, the school and home closer together in a band 
of intellectual and spiritual sympathy. This getting the home 
and school closer together is one of the things most to be desired. 
Col. Francis Parker said on this subject: “The tremendous ad- 
vantage of a rational course of work in country schools is that it 
would make a strong binding union of the home and the school; 
the farm methods and the school methods. It would bring the 
farm into the school and project the school into the farm. It 
would give the parent and teacher one motive in the carrying 
out of which both could heartily join. The parent would appre- 
ciate and judge fairly the work of the school; the teacher would 
honor, dignify, and elevate the work of the farm.” 
A school improvement league is needed in almost every com- 
munity. It might have as its object, first, the improvement of 
school grounds and buildings; second, the building up of a school
-P-A-G-E-308
    308 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
library containing suitable reading matter, not for the pupils 
alone, but for all of the people of the community ; and, third, the 
providing of works of art for the school rooms. The ideal in or- 
ganizing a certain school improvement association has been de- 
scribed by one of the members in these words. “The ideal in 
organizing such associations was to make the rural school char- 
acter-builders, to rid the districts of surroundings which destroy 
character ; such as unkept school yards, foul, nasty outhouses, un- 
fit teachers. These reforms, you understand, come only through 
a healthy educational sentiment which is aroused by a sympa- 
thetic codperation of farm, home, and school.” 
Women should be the ones to take a leading part in the dis- 
cussions at the meetings of these organizations. They are realiz- 
ing their opportunities more and more. Formerly women at- 
tended the farmers’ institutes and some were even brave enough 
to allow themselves to be put on the program for papers. But 
women were not expected to join in the general discussions. Now 
the most important part of the institute is the woman’s depart- 
ment. Here papers are read by the women themselves and en- 
thusiastic discussions follow. Both country women and city wo- 
men can meet here on equal footing and discuss the questions 
that are of vital importance to both. There must be no mission- 
ary spirit in this work. All of us are dependent on the farmer. 
The best that we can give is only his own, for the city has robbed 
the country of its best. If the country does not prosper neither 
will the city. 
There are many other ways in which women may help the 
country schools. One is as head of the tomato club. This or- 
ganization is doing a great deal to arouse in our young people an 
enthusiasm for growing things. It develops the pride of owner- 
ship and teaches honesty, neatness, accuracy and codperation. It 
gives our girls healthful, out-door employment and best of all, 
helps a girl to make her own spending money in the very best 
way. The meeting brings the girls of the community together in 
a social way. 
As county superintendents and supervisors of rural schools 
women are rendering efficient aid to the country schools. As 
members of school boards they can do an untold amount of good. 
Medical inspection, and compulsory education will not be so hard 
to get when there are more women on our school boards.

To summarize briefly: The school and home should be redo- 
lent with the atmosphere of the country. The profession of 
farming should be dignified. All honor should be paid to those 
who feed and clothe the entire world. Just here I wish to enter 
a protest against the “hay seed” jokes and the comic pictures of 
the farmer. The school should be the most attractive spot in the . 
community. Here the boys and girls should be educated for the 
country and the adults, too, find recreation and instruction. The 
teacher should be a part of the community—willing to stay the 
whole year round. She and the mother should be in close sym- 
pathy with each other. With the country woman and the city 
woman, the housewife and the business woman, the mother and 
the teacher, all working together thus and thus only can the 
rural school come into its own, and fulfill its high mission. 
WOMAN’S WORK IN COLLEGE. 
DR. IRENE T. MYERS, LEXINGTON, KY. 
Of course various interpretations of the subject assigned to 
me are possible, but I have understood that it refers to the char- 
acter of work women should do in college to obtain an under- 
graduate degree and not at all to a summary of their achieve- 
ments, congratulatory as such a discussion might well be made. 
I have of course understood that we here recognize the fact that 
no legislature can bestow upon a college the right to confer de- 
grees; that such a right must be won by the college itself through 
the sincere establishing and maintaining of proper standards. 
We deplore, I am sure, the situation in the South which forces 
the United States Specialist in Higher Education to report that 
among our one hundred and forty odd “colleges” for women, 
but one can unqualifiedly be placed in the first rank. 
This explanation is necessary because I am not trying to 
make my remarks applicable to high schools and schools of a 
lower grade, that are called colleges, or to trade schools, or to 
technical schools of any sort. 
From any standpoint chosen, however, it is meritable that 
a discussion of the subject involve sooner or later the question 
of vocational training in the college. For in our past experi- 
ence, wherever we have found a subject which seems good in 
some grades or types of educational work, we usually attempt, 
for a while at least, to apply it everywhere. At present, we 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
310 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
can no more escape the discussion of vocational training than 
once upon a time we were able to escape psychology. You will 
remember that it was to us a pillar of fire in our wanderings, 
and apperception was the rod which smote us to refreshing 
fluency; and then again it was manual training, “educative, not 
industrial,” we were assured, and now it is industrial for the 
most part, although we call it vocational, through which alone 
we may find salvation. 
Each of these has passed, or will, along with our other edu- 
cational discoveries, from the forefront of consideration to its 
normal place, and has contributed, or will, its share to our 
illumination. 
When we are in the midst of the first bright blaze, how- 
ever, we are likely to be blinded to what stands strongly and 
permanently in our educational background. 
As I intimated a moment ago, it is difficult to see beyond 
industrial training at present. We have acquired its vocabu- 
lary, we reiterate its phrases, we are obessed by “practical 
values,” meaning by that money values. Nevertheless, I am 
about to attempt the impossible, I am going to try to discuss 
industrial training as related subordinately to vocational train- 
ing in the college. In other words, I shall try, as we say of a 
disagreeably obtrusive person, to put her in her “proper place.” 
It is necessary just here to explain perhaps the discrimination 
I make between industrial and vocational subjects. I do not 
use these terms synonymously, because, while training in an 
industry is training for a vocation, training for a vocation may 
not be training in an industry at all. 
Perhaps I should say also here that I believe college work 
for women should be of a vocational character. I am not con- 
vinced that it should be industrial. 
To illustrate: the normal feminine vocation, as has been 
assiduously pointed out by both men and women, is wifehood 
and motherhood, with all their attendant obligations. Acknowl- 
edged by us among these obligations is the care of a home, and 
this involves a more or. less practical knowledge of certain 
industries, notably cooking, sewing and laundering. 
I am old fashioned enough still to believe that practice in 
the doing of these things, at least in many of our Southern lo- 
calities, could and should be obtained in the home.
-P-A-G-E-311
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 311 
I do not see that it is for our ultimate good that the state 
should relieve the mothers of the responsibility of training 
their daughters in these particulars; but unquestionably they 
should be so trained, and if the state must do it through the 
schools, it should offer the training where the masses of pupils 
are to be found, namely, in the grades and high schools. It is 
a very small percentage of the total number of prospective 
wives and mothers which reaches the college, and over and over 
again it has been demonstrated that a woman who has been 
disciplined by college training, can solve without great mental 
strain the mysteries of the weekly wash; can set a table, and 
can serve a meal which will not be unbalanced by a disastrous 
conjunction of potatoes, hominy and rice. She may or may not 
be able to construct a fashionable gown or a wearable hat. 
Artists of such sort are born before being made. 
We must not lose sight of the fact that the time at the dis- 
posal of the college is limited; that it has approximately but 
sixty hours in which to inspire, inform, suggest and discipline. 
We must also remember that these advocated feminine indus- 
tries make no higher demand upon the intellect than can easily 
be met by the more immature student below the college grades; 
further, the training for an industry, by its very nature, en- 
courages imitation rather than to independent thought; it 
weakens initiative, rather than stimulates to independent en- 
deavor. The great object of the college is, in my judgment, 
directly opposed to this; consequently it seems to me most un- 
fortunate whenever its time is consumed and its training diluted 
by the introduction of such industries. We shall, I believe, in- 
evitably pay in poverty of spirit for what we gain through 
them in manual dexterity. 
But a vocational training for the demands of domestic life 
does not necessarily involve this waste of the college hours. 
Chemistry, physics, bacteriology, hygiene, given as college sub- 
jects, bear directly upon these industries, and upon other activ- 
ities of women, and should be made to bear even more directly 
upon them, while at the same time they broaden the student’s 
view, make more accurate her observation, and stimulates in~ 
stead of deadening her mentality. 
It is possible through these, and other courses of equal 
value, in which a woman’s far-reaching relations are accorded 
through scientific study, to dignify that vocation of wifehood 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
312 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
and motherhood in the minds of young women. I think it un- 
fortunate that all young women can not have the opportunity 
thus to face open-eyed the responsibilities of their womanhood; 
and to realize, at least to some degree, that those responsibili- 
ties go far beyond the purely physical services that may be 
demanded of them. But let us at least assure to the young 
women of the college this wider vision. 
There are, I think, several reasons why practice in indus- 
tries is being pushed into the college period. First, there is the 
financial appeal which they make. For our state colleges and 
universities they may be relied upon to help loosen the purse- 
strings of the legislators, who are peculiarly susceptible to 
graduation gowns that cost one dollar and a half and hats 
that cost less. The instruction which can show how to achieve 
these is pretty certain to stand in high favor. The average 
legislator is not likely to question closely whether its work in- 
clines towards a trade school than towards a college. 
The financial appeal is also felt by the executive of the 
privately endowed institution, where revenue depends some- 
what upon numbers, and popular and easy practice in indus- 
tries may be relied upon to swell the student roll. 
But I think that more strongly than by the financial con- 
sideration men have been moved by a vague consciousness that 
it is unfair to train other men in agriculture, dairying and 
animal husbandry, for example, and offer to women nothing 
correspondingly feminine. Consequently, practice in women’s 
most familiar occupations have, without much thought been 
provided for them in the college. 
I have no quarrel with men for what they have done in 
this direction, for they can not be expected to consider the de- 
tails of women’s educational needs as understandingly as should 
women themselves; but I would urge upon you to think out for 
yourselves carefully how your rightful share in educational 
funds can best be expended, that you may be ready with sug- 
gestion and plan when the opportunity comes to offer them. 
It is indeed here now, and our thoughtful conclusions will be 
gladly welcomed. There is no clash of sex interest in educa- 
tion. Whatever makes for the highest progress of either sex 
must ultimately make also for the good of the other. 
To return to the vocational training of a woman in col- 
lege. It is possible only to illustrate my meaning further, not
-P-A-G-E-313
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 313 
to discuss it fully. For example, we are recognizing more and 
more clearly that children can not be satisfactorily reared, under 
present conditions, simply by loving them and giving them per- 
sonal physical care. 
However, in doing this at the present time, a woman passes 
far beyond the actual service of her hands, and must face the 
complications of her social relations. For her children, as has 
been repeatedly pointed out, are subject to the conditions around 
them; they may suffer from her neighbors’ violation of sanitary 
laws; they may be fed upon infected foods if the municipal 
housekeeping is not intelligently safe-guarded; they may be 
clothed in germ-laden garments if the manufactories and public 
laundries are not carefully supervised. 
It seems to be a function of the college to try to provide in 
every community at least a nucleus of women with trained 
minds, able to grapple with the obviously feminine problems 
which arise throught the interpretation of private and public 
housekeeping. Moveover, the colleges must provide a nucleus 
of women intelligently interested in these things. They must 
have been enlightened through sociology, economics, ethics, and - 
similar courses, if they are to have a steady grip upon this phase 
of their vocation. It is to the college we must look for women 
who can take leadership in such affairs in their communities. - 
When we follow a woman’s care for the physical well-being 
of her family upon this broad plane, we can not tell where the 
physical merges into the spiritual, but it is of small matter, for 
we know that it is her vocation to see that their souls have a 
chance to grow strong and healthy as well as their bodies. I do 
not mean for an instant to imply that all the responsibilities of 
parenthood rest upon the woman, but we are discussing voca- 
tional training for women in the college. I believe that psychol- 
ogy and literature, and history, for example, have a very direct 
bearing upon the spiritual side of that training. In fact, what- 
ever in the college work defines, and at the same time elevates a 
woman’s moral standards, is qualifying her to discharge more 
efficiently her responsibilities to her family. 
For instance, if she is incapable of sitting in judgment upon 
picture shows and picture postcards, we may expect her chil- 
dren to be equally undiscriminating, and insiduously the mod- 
esty of girlhood and the purity of boyhood will be undermined. 
The training of the college woman must make her alive to this
-P-A-G-E-314
314 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
possibility, and care for her own children, if not for others, will 
inevitably force her into attempting to safeguard the commun- 
ity life. In order to do this, her training must have been suffi- 
ciently broad to make her a constructive force. In the place of 
things that are vulgar, she must be able to suggest and develop 
agencies that are elevating. 
There is but one other phase of the vocational training of a 
woman which I shall emphasize and that is this: she should be so 
equipped that she will spend her leisure hours intelligently. It 
is possible for us to plan our college training with too exclusive 
reference to the after work of the woman, for her life can not be 
one continuous expenditure of energy. There must be in it all 
along the way periods of rest and recreation, and I am con- - 
vinced that it takes a high degree of intelligence to discriminate 
between amusements, for instance, that heal and soothe the 
spirit, and those which irritate it; between hours which in real- 
ity recreate one’s physical nature, and hours which destroy it. 
A woman has to learn that she finds rest in the shadow of 
great things, not in whirling excitedly from diversion to diver- 
sion, or in driving herself from one form of work to another. 
To my mind, any vocational training of women in college must 
recognize this fact, and try to lead her where these great things 
are to be found—in nature, in literature, in art, in religion— 
that she may know where to turn when soul and body weary. 
Unless she learns how to maintain her own serenity and poise, 
her home will certainly not be the abode of peace, nor will she 
be the efficient counsellor and comrade she should be in her fam- 
ily. It is surely apparent that if we of the college keep steadily 
before us what is involved in training a woman for her usual 
vocation, we shall have little time to give her practice in indus- 
tries. 
We have considered in this discussion but one vocation for 
woman, and the relation to it of college training. We can not 
of course close our eyes to the tread of woman towards economic 
independence, but whatever else they may become, the great 
mass with which the college will have to do will be primarily 
wives and mothers. If they are to follow some other calling as 
well, they should receive special training for it in a technical or 
professional school. 
It is a difficult matter now, and I believe is going to be yet 
more difficult, to hold steadfastly to sane and right ideals in the
-P-A-G-E-315
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 315 
training of young women. For we are in a state of transition 
from a passive to an active participation in the industrial, the 
intellectual, the religious, the political life of the nation. We 
are moving towards larger responsibilities, along untried paths, 
with increasing liberty. We are going to encounter temptations 
unknown in the old life. Our habits and our passions will per- 
haps be no more restrained by convention than are man’s. I 
have faith that a finer, stronger, womanhood will result from 
the change, but we need hereafter, wise leaders, who will not 
allow us to become over-confident, who will point out our weak- 
nesses, and who will furnish a strong force to resist the evils by 
which our new liberty will surely be attended. 
We are so accustomed to hear ourselves reckoned as better 
than men, that sometimes I fear we have come to believe it. 
Personally, I do not think we are better. In some particulars 
we are strong, but in others weak. We have been checked by 
family, by religion, by sex-customs, but these checks are loosen- 
ing, and we shall ourselves have to prove what we are when the 
outside restraint has been removed. 
It is not necessary for me here to go into our weaknesses. 
I mention them only to emphasize whatever in the college train- 
ing makes us acquainted with ourselves, and gives the poise of 
sane judgment, of thoughtful self-restraint, of calm vision, is in 
itself a preparation for that severe test which we as women, in- 
dividually and collectively, are facing. 
It must be a part of the college woman’s vocation to hold 
fast to that which is good. 
DEPARTMENT OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
PRESIDENT—PROF. L. L. VANN, Roanoke, Ala. 
SECRETARY—PRoF. R. Y. MAXEY, Hardinsburg, Ky. 
The President, Prof. L. L. Vann, called the meeting to order 
at 2:30 p. m., Friday, October 31. 
In the absence of the regular Secretary, Prof. R. Y. Maxey, 
the house elected Prof. W. B. Boyd, of Cookville, Tenn., as Sec- 
retary pro-tem. 
Following which a very able and interesting paper was read 
upon the following subject: ‘Industrial Education in Second- 
ary Schools, and Means and Methods of Bringing the School’s 
Influence into the Home Life of the Patrons.”
-P-A-G-E-316
316 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
In the absence of Mr. Victor Kays, Dr. Kirk was asked to 
discuss the subject. Dr. Kirk spoke forcefully of the lack of 
adaptation to the needs of the community on the part of the 
high schools; also of the difficulty of making the proper connec- 
tion since each community has an interest peculiarly its own. 
The speaker insisted that much of the class room work fails to 
take root in the consciousness of the student. Children work as 
hired hands he said. All mechanical work must give way to 
things which will function in practical life tomorrow. 
Following which discussion, subject No. 2 was taken up. 
The chair introduced Mr. Geo. M. Lynch. 
Following the address of Mr. Lynch, and in the absence of 
Superintendent Thomas, Mr. Baker spoke briefly most heartily 
commending the speaker’s paper, insisting that the suggestions 
were both sound and practical. 
This finished, the third subject upon the evening’s pro- 
gram was taken up: “School Credit for Home Duties.” Mr. 
Chas. B. Glenn was introduced, who read a strong and interest- 
ing paper. : 
The above paper was discussed by Mr. Harry H. Clark, who 
stated in the introduction of his address that he would take the 
negative and bring issue with the paper. Mr. Clark was of the 
opinion that the system suggested and advocated by the speaker 
was probably one of our many “fads,” and that reports from a 
great many sections of different states indicate the fact that the 
scheme is waning. Mr. Clark said that this is an age of fads. 
Mr. Clark said the American people are given to trying out new 
things. He said so far as he was concerned he was willing for 
the other fellow to try out some of the new things and find their 
value. Mr. Clark further said that there are a few things which 
we in the South have found to be valuable beyond doubt. To- 
mato clubs, corn clubs, potato clubs, ete. He advised that we 
hold on carefully to these and use them to greatest advantage. 
The fourth subject of the program was “The High School 
Training Course for Rural Teachers.” The President introduced 
Mr. Tate of South Carolina, who spoke in a most interesting and 
direct way. 
This closed the regular program for the afternoon, where- 
upon the President announced the election of officers for the new 
year was now in order. Mr. Adam Phillips, of Concord, Tenn., 
was elected President; Mr. Harry H. Clark, Vice-President, and 
Mr. Chas. B. Glenn, Secretary.

INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN SECONDARY~ SCHOOLS 
AND MEANS AND METHODS OF BRINGING THE 
SCHOOL’S INFLUENCE INTO THE HOME 
LIFE OF THE PATRONS. 
W. A. LEWIS, HAYS, KANSAS. 
That you are familiar with the history of the cloisters of 
long ago which were the archives of the world’s knowledge I 
am quite assured. But I want to call your attention again to 
the fact that as the world became more populous and civiliza- 
tion more complex, an indiscriminating demand for a more 
common distribution of the sum of knowledge opened the doors 
of learning to the men and women who make up the average 
of citizenship. You will also remember this education was not 
from a careful study of their peculiar requirements in life but 
it was given on the ground that an education in which language 
and mathematics predominated would especially fit them for 
citizenship. When, in America, the school left the village and 
traveled out into the country, it carried along with it a system 
of education distinct and without special relation to the life of 
the community. The school in the village or the city did not 
match the situation a farthing better for the life of the citizen 
within the corporation than it did for the life of the citizen in 
the rural district. 
We are celebrating in Kansas today the fiftieth annivers- 
ary of the founding of our State Agricultural College at Man- 
hattan. It is a notable event in the history of the State. The 
school’s achievements have been remarkable. It stands as one 
of the great institutions of the world. However, the Agricul- 
tural College of Kansas in 1863 and the Agricultural College of 
1913 would not be recognized as belonging at all to the same 
type of school. This same College of Agriculture today, with 
its many phases of industrial training, is still in its infant de- 
velopment. The high class normal school of today has taken 
up the industrial work and is now struggling for a proper so- 
lution of the relationship which should exist between the purely 
academic, or so-called cultural, subjects and the practical, or in- 
dustrial, subjects. 
The Western Kansas State Normal School has in its high 
school about 150 boys and girls. These young people come from 
a variety; of homes, from frugal as well as generous support.
-P-A-G-E-318
  318 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
However, they are children of a community whose chief busi- 
ness in life is agricultural. We must give these young people 
a literary education. We must give them historical background 
for their perspective. |. We must give them literature and art 
and music as well as skill in the kitchen, in the dining room, 
and in the laundry room; efficiency as housekeepers and moth- 
ers, serviceability in each. Practical stockmen, farmers, me- 
chanics, citizens. We must create in them a desire for social 
intercourse, good books, good literature; a joy in solving prob- 
lems of right living, of right eating, of increased production 
and soil fertility, of better domestic animals, of a higher and 
happier private and community life. 
In the past, if I remember’ my own experience correctly, 
the high school taught us literature either for the sake of litera- 
ture or as a prerequisite to the university. We were taught 
algebra and geometry chiefly that we might master the subject 
and have sufficient clearness in elucidation after entering col- 
lege, that we could reflect credit upon our high school and 
teacher. Manual training consisted in making paper knives, 
letter boxes, racks and frames, and, as I remember it now, the 
chief boast and pleasure of our instructor was to point to the 
number of exercises as exercises that we had mastered. The 
usefulness of manual training in its relationship to anything 
else seemed never to have been thought of. Looking back over 
the various high schools and high school work with which I am 
acquainted, I find the teachers of mathematics and literature, 
history and science teaching chiefly for the sake of the subject 
matter. My impressions now are that the work was not done 
especially for the sake of the boys and girls, not especially for 
their sake when they were to become mothers and husbandmen 
taking part in the work of the world. The high school that we 
are maintaining at the Western Kansas State Normal School is 
trying to correlate literature, mathematics, history, science, art, 
and music with home art and home science, with animal indus- 
try and field crops, and the whole business of citizenship in its 
actual living. 
From the records of one of our most populous states I find 
that 60 per cent. of the children stop at the sixth grade, less 
that 20 per cent. enter the high school, that only 12 per cent. 
graduate from the high school. Less than three individuals for 
every one hundred who entered school as little chaps have car-
-P-A-G-E-319
        JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 319 
ried away from the college or university a degree, and yet we 
still have the foolish scramble going on today of principals and 
superintendents to secure university or college accrediting. 
They completely ignore the fact that the high school is the col- 
lege of the people and the college and university are the colleges 
of the specialist. When we find a superintendent, such for in- 
stance, as Superintendent Wirt, of Gary, Indiana, working dili- 
gently and faithfully to perfect a high school to meet the needs 
of his constituency, he is heralded all over the land as being one 
of the wonders of the twentieth century. It should not be so. It 
should be one of the wonders of the world that any one even 
attempted to use the community’s money to build an adjunct to 
some distant university or college rather than a school of prep- 
aration for the citizens who support the institution. 
Facing the fact that only an exceedingly small percentage 
of the boys and girls of a community ever finish the high school, 
it is certainly the duty of the high school to match the situation 
by presenting a course of study so thoroughly fitting in its pur- 
pose and results that the life of an individual who has been 
brought under its influence may approach most nearly the per- 
fect man or woman. 
Our teacher of literature should select the literature of the 
home, the fireside, the wild woods, and the prairies. It is the 
literature that the boys and girls can interpret, understand, and 
appreciate. The mathematics they get applies to the business 
of the farmer, to the business of the merchant, and to the lum- 
berman. It applies to the measuring of land, to the actual run- 
ning of drainage and irrigating ditches, to real road building, 
to the calculation of stress or strain in bridge building and to 
the. determination of such engineering problems as come up in 
the ordinary affairs of life. The history is not taught for the 
purpose of learning the political intrigues and cabals, star cham- 
ber sessions of statesmen, or of tremendous battles for the pur- 
pose of marvelling at the enormous loss of life and limb, but the 
history taught is the history of the common man. The history 
of the race is industrial. It is the history of the development of 
the tillage implements, of the harvester, of the cotton gin, of the 
printing press, and of the railroads. It is the history of the 
evolution of the home and home life. The history of dress and 
manners. In fact, the history which we are bringing into the 
lives of our young people is largely the history which their an-
-P-A-G-E-320
   
      320 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
cestors lived and helped to make. Such, in reality, can be the 
only real appreciated history to the average American boy and 
American girl. This, at once, makes the home the laboratory 
for original or source work, from the home the boy brings his 
problems for surveying, for bridge building, for road making, 
for irrigation or drainage. From the home the boy and girl 
bring their original material in the realms of history. They 
have discussed with mother and father the lives of grandmother 
and grandfather, their privations, their successes, their experi- 
ences, and the civilization in which they lived. Some will have 
grandfathers and grandmothers who can furnish them extended 
research work into the lives and development of the generations 
preceding. A community can furnish boys and girls who can 
come into the school room having at their finger tips original 
material extending back over the world’s development even an 
hundred years. To me it is the sort of source work that should 
find its way into the secondary school. 
The home science and art and the agriculture are really the 
foundations of human prosperity and human happiness and they 
deserve and should have a very large place in the development 
of the boy and girl while in their secondary school life. How- 
ever, the home art and the home science must be as the name 
implies, not mere series of exercises. The home art must be 
such art as is applicable to the practical in home life and by the 
practical I do not mean the commonplace, I mean the useful. 
By the term useful I mean those things that go for comfort and 
cleanliness, beauty and refinement. The same is true of home 
science. It must be real home science. It is comparatively 
worthless if it does not go into the home kitchen and home din- 
ing room and solve the problems in the home of the boy and the 
girl. If the girl does not go into the home and there demon- 
strate her ability to do home cooking and home serving effi- 
ciently, she has not gotten in her school work what she should. 
If the boy does not take up the problems of carpentry, of barn 
building, or house building, of furniture building, of harness 
mending, of shoe mending, from his manual training, it is com- 
paratively worthless. If his blacksmithing does not teach him 
to sharpen the plowshare, to weld the broken bar, he is wasting 
his time in such a blacksmith shop. I am insistent that the 
agriculture the boy gets in the secondary school shall be the 
agriculture that is applicable to and functions in the farm. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
        JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 321 
sneers about the book farmer are, in much, justifiable. We have 
been trying to make agriculturists but we have been developing 
educated theorists. The work given the boy in the secondary 
school should be such that he can specifically apply on the farm, 
in the field or in the dining room. 
Life is too diversified and too exacting upon men and 
women to start them in life with theories in the hope that they 
may rise as a carrier pigeon and soar about for a period of time, 
get their location and fly unerringly to their proper niche in life. 
The business of the school should be to eliminate those of inde- 
cision and wandering about. The girl who finishes her domestic 
science in the secondary school and graduates without first earn- 
ing a grade as an efficient cook and housekeeper in her mother’s 
kitchen is getting a record of achievement to which she is not at 
all entitled. The boy in the high school who gets a grade in 
agriculture before he has demonstrated on his father’s farm or 
the home garden or the carpenter shop, that the thing he men- 
tally possesses he also has practically, is accredited with ability 
and information to which he is not entitled, and I maintain that 
the school of the future, the secondary school, must have as co- 
6perative instructors, the mothers and fathers at the home and 
the final test of efficiency of the boy and girl must come from 
the home and be entered on the records of the secondary school 
as work accomplished, as possessing both information and ser- 
viceable knowledge. The grade in history and literature must 
come from the living room and dining room. It must come 
from the social and business receptions and meetings where the 
boy and girl have demonstrated that they have developed tact 
and grace and conversational ability and desirable information 
which should be the product of their work in the class room of 
the english and history teacher. I want the home to become the 
laboratory and library of the secondary school. That twelve 
months out of the year the boy and the girl work in the home as 
their library and as their laboratory. That the boy in the fields 
demonstrates he is a real student of nature, that he understands: 
nature, and he possesses skill in manipulating nature to bring 
forth fruits for the harvest. That the girl in the home demon- 
strates she is a real student of art, that she understands art and 
her home is a concrete example of her ability and knowledge 
and her table is an expression of things worth while.

When the secondary school shall have taken the home and 
the farm and the store and the shop as an essential part of its 
library and laboratory equipment, then and not until then will 
the influence of the school become an efficient agency in the up- 
building and development of high class citizenship for the state. 
We too often generalize and wish for marvelous systems 
and wonderful results, but it is quite another thing to accom- 
plish the work. There are several factors in opposition to the 
type of a high school which I have been attempting to describe. 
The chief factor is lack of codperation or sympathetic under- 
standing on the part of the ordinary high school faculty. I be- 
lieve I am conservative in my estimate when I claim that the 
public schools of America are today fully fifty years behind the 
schools that the unexpressed sentiment of America would have. 
The average high school principal and town superintendent 
fears to change his school system from that of the good old 
days. The teacher is the conservative stand-patter of the stand- 
patters and does not launch out in his endeavor to fit the school 
to the community for fear he will be termed a “grandstander” 
or a “faddist.” We are making spasmodic efforts here and there 
in our attempt to reach the future need of our community life. 
In some places we will find a professor of mathematics in the 
high school having his boys doing the surveying of the com- 
munity, or doing such other common practical phases of engin- 
eering which can be done with the spirit level and tape line, but 
that professor is extremely lonesome in the school faculty and 
he is looked upon by the majority of his co-workers as a peculiar 
individual. The professor of agriculture is immediately ac- 
cused of an attempt to monopolize all of the time of the students 
and to absorb all of the lime-light of the community, when he 
goes into the home and organizes dairying clubs, swine feeding 
clubs, poultry clubs, and kitchen garden clubs. He is accused 
of wanting to be the whole faculty and very often there is keen 
resentment and jealousies engendered: because of the astonish- 
ing discovery of other members of the faculty that the boys and 
girls have taken a vital interest and whole enjoyment in work 
where they are contributors in place of being recipients. The 
young American is ambitious and he wants to take part in the 
things which are going on and this sort of work not only teaches 
him the art of production but it teaches him the value of self- 
equating. There isn’t anything finer than to see the struggle of
-P-A-G-E-323
        JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 323 
the young fellow in battling against odds, failing in one attack, 
turning to some other point of attack against such time when he 
shall be successful. In addition to the practical and servicable 
knowledge obtained in club work is the lesson of courageous per- 
severance learned early in life. With the girls the poultry clubs, 
the butter and cheese-making clubs, the kitchen garden clubs, the 
sewing, dressmaking, and cooking clubs, give the girl the same 
advantage for self-measurement and self-balance and confidence 
that the club work does for the boys. Many a young girl in the 
country, who has never had a particle of domestic art in her 
life, has become an efficient housekeeper because of her mem- 
bership in some sort of a club, and my idea of the club work 
among young people is that it should be distinctly a part of the 
laboratory forces and equipment of the school. With the school 
reaching out into the home in the form of club work, we reach 
the life of the boy and the girl the hours of the day when we do 
not have them in the school room, and the day of the year when 
school is not in session and we leave a methodical habit, a bus- 
iness like way of doing things, a schedule and organized order- 
liness that becomes a firm habit which follows them through 
their entire life. I think it is unnecessary for me to give any 
extended discussion at this point that for richness of material 
for the teacher of literature, languages, civics, political and 
commercial geography, this sort of club work is without an 
equal. 
We are struggling in America to match the demands of the 
public but we are going at it on the blind side. In place of the 
teachers going out into the community which furnishes the boys 
and girls for the secondary school, the trouble in the past has 
been that the teacher has sat in his office and theoretically de- 
termined what the perfect citizen should be. The trouble in the 
past has been that we have taken up the student as a piece of 
crude material to be fashioned and chisseled to suit our de- 
mands, and we have failed to recognize the average individual 
is as full of knots and twists and irregularities as any stick of 
timber we could possibly find. We have learned long ago to se- 
lect suitable material to build machinery to do high class and 
efficient work. The American school master seems to be just 
awakening to the fact that he will have to select proper machin- 
ery and proper methods to work on such a variety of crude ma- 
terial as is furnished him in the boy and girl. I am not a pessi-   
-P-A-G-E-324

mist in any sense of the word. I do not belong to those who 
claim that the American school system is, or has been, a failure. 
I belong to that group of individuals who believe that if there 
is a possibility of getting a dollar more profit or an ounce more 
of efficiency from any piece of labor, the operator is not work- 
ing up to his highest capacity. I am optimistic and a firm be- 
liever in the ultimate correct solution of things. My story is a 
plea to hasten the day when the school plant and the school mas- 
ter shall reach their plane of highest efficiency in the American 
community life. 
SCHOOL CREDIT FOR HOME DUTIES. 
CHAS. B. GLENN, BIRMINGHAM, ALA. 
Mr. President, Gentlemen: 
Among the many devices for bringing the home and the 
school nearer together, none at present is attracting more at- 
tention nor seems to promise more beneficial results than the 
plan of giving credit at school for the tasks performed at home. 
As described in a recent report from the National Bureau 
of Education, the various plans being tried throughout the 
United States may be classified broadly into two groups: 
First, where home work is assigned to supplement the 
work at school—this to be supervised and the results judged 
by the teacher. 
Second, no special assignment of additional home work, but 
a report made by the parent of the manner in which the child 
performs the regular tasks about the home. 
The first plan endeavors to make the home the laboratory, 
as it were, for the working out and application of the theories 
and information learned at school. Easy application of this 
plan is found in the study of such a subject as agriculture. 
Many schools have no school farms or gardens, hence the child 
is privileged, or required, to apply the theoretical knowledge 
gained at school to the growing of plants at home. 
Such duties as bread-making, cooking, sewing, house-clean- 
ing, etc., may be assigned to the girls,—the home work being 
made the basis for reading and study at school and for class- 
room discussion. 
Careful records are kept and the results examined at reg- 
ular intervals by the teacher. 
 
-P-A-G-E-325
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 325 
This plan has been adopted by many schools both ele- 
mentary and high throughout the United States. 
The second plan attempts to encourage the pupil to help in 
the regular home work, and to do his part well. To do this, 
the parent is requested to grade the child in these home duties 
and the teacher agrees to accept this estimate. 
In some schools this record for skill and industry in home 
tasks is given the same credit by the teacher as that given to 
any one of the regular school branches, and the marks given 
by the parent are averaged in with those given by the teacher 
as a basis for the pupil’s promotion. 
In other schools the marks given by the parent do not enter 
into, or affect, the record given by the teacher, but, in deter- 
mining a pupil’s fitness for the work of the next grade, both 
estimates are considered. 
This second plan was tried to a limited extent in our own 
system of schools during the past session and is being con- 
tinued this year. 
Printed cards containing the following note to the parents 
were distributed to the seventh grade children of seventeen of 
our largest white elementary schools: 
The parent is requested to answer the following questions and to grade 
the child in as many of the items given on the other side of this card as it 
has had an opportunity to show skill and industry. The school desires to 
help the child by recognizing industry and excellence in home occupations, 
and is willing to accept the parents’ estimates: 
1. How much time daily does child give to helping about home? 
2. How much time daily is given to employment away from home? 
3. How much time daily is given to preparation of lessons? 
4. How much time daily is given to practice in piano?______-_-_____-

5. How much time daily is given to reading other than school books? 
6. How much time daily is given to play or recreation? 
7. In what subject is the child chiefly interested? 
8. What does it do best? 
The following is a summary of the replies:

Attention is called to the following facts as shown by these 
summaries: 
Of the 705 cards sent out 624, or 89 per cent. were re- 
turned filled out by the parents, showing their interest and 
willingness to codperate. 
Of the 624 replies received, 545, or 87 per cent. are re- 
ported as helping about the home; 79, or 13 per cent. either 
have no home duties or do not perform them. The average 
time given to home duties by those who are reported as assist- 
ing is something over one hour and a half. 
Ninety-seven (97), or 15 per cent., almost one-sixth of the 
children, are employed away from home for an average time 
of more than two hours a day. 
Five hundred ninety (590), or 95 per cent. of the seventh 
grade children do home studying, spending an average time of 
more than an hour and a half in the preparation of their les- 
sons. Five (5) per cent. of the children, it would seem, do no 
home studying. It is interesting to note that the average time 
spent in helping about the home and in the preparation of les- 
sons is the same, that is, one hour and thirty-nine minutes. 
Nearly half of our seventh grade children spend some time 
practicing on musical instruments. The 263, or 42 per cent. 
who do, devote an average of over an hour to it daily. 
While a great many more children are reported as doing 
general reading—407, or 65 per cent.—the average time spent 
is less than an hour a day. 
As reported by our parents, not all of our children engage 
in play. Five hundred twenty (520), or 83 per cent. spend an 
average of an hour and a half daily. 
The seventh question asked of parents was: “In what sub- 
ject is the child chiefly interested?” The replies have been class- 
ified and tabulated as follows: 
SUBJECTS IN WHICH CHILDREN ARE CHIEFLY INTERESTED. 
No. Subject. No. Subject. 
1. Money Making. 10. Mechanics, 
1. Photography. 16. Athletics. 
iPlay. 20. Baseball. 
1. Suffrage. 30. Art. 
1. Inventions. 51. Domestic Science. 
1. Dancing. 82. Music, 
1. Sunday School Work. 40. School 
2. Poultry. 5. Spelling.
-P-A-G-E-327

3. Animals. 30. Grammar. 
4. Boy Scout. 54. Reading. 
7. Electricity. 57. History. 
8. Gardening. 61. Mathematics. 
10. Politics. 54. Can’t tell. 
It is interesting to note among other things from these 
reports that: 
1. Money-making is given as the chief interest of only 
one child out of the 624. The same is true of play, dancing, 
and Sunday school work. 
2. According to her mother, one girl finds the suffrage 
question of greatest interest. 
3. Baseball is reported as the chief interest of twenty 
(20), while just twice as many (40), seem to be chiefly inter- 
ested in school. 
4. Of the school branches reported, mathematics seems 
to command first place in the interest of the child. 
5. It is significant that 54 parents replied that they could 
not tell what was the chief interest of their child. 
8. The last question asked was: “What does your child 
do best?” The replies have been classified as follows: 
WHAT CHILDREN DO BEST. 
No. No. 
1. Care for poultry. 9. Garden. 
1. Keep up with topics of the day. 7. Practice elocution. 
1. Hat and sleep. 12. Study and practice art. 
2. Telegraph. 12. Engage in athletics. 
2: Print. 17. Work at mechanics. 
2. Act as handy boy. 53. Practice music. 
2. Work with electricity. 112. Attend to school work. 
6. Play. 135. Practice domestic science. 
5. Attend to business affairs. 76. Can’t tell. 
One can but wonder whether it was with a feeling of sad- 
ness, or thankfulness, or only with a keen sense of humor that 
one honest parent replies that the best thing his child does is 
to “eat and sleep.” 
To the credit of the teachers be it known that the parents 
report 112 pupils or nearly 20 per cent. as “attending to their 
school work’ better than they do anything else. 
Seventy-six parents could not tell what their children did 
best. 
Following these eight questions there was given on the 
printed card a list of eighteen home duties in which the parent 
   
-P-A-G-E-328
328 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
was requested to grade his child according to the following 
scale: 
Satisfactory: “a” Excellent, “b’” Fairly Good. 
Unsatisfactory: “ce” Ordinary, “d’ Very Poor. 
The results were as follows:

The results as shown by this table are exceedingly interesting. Attention is called to only a few. 
Whether from lack of opportunity or other cause, not half 
of our children do any garden work, although this report was 
made in the late spring. Of the 274 marked in this, 57, or 
nearly one-fourth are unsatisfactory workmen. 
Only about 15 per cent. of our children have any experi- 
ence in caring for horses or cows. One-third of these are re- 
ported as doing their work unsatisfactorily. 
About 80 per cent. of our children are reported by their 
parents as taking an interest in their books; 90 per cent. of 
these are marked as taking a satisfactory interest. 
Of the 279 graded in bread and biscuit making, 85 are 
said to be excellent, while 43 are very poor. 
Classing the “satisfactory” pupils as promoted, and the 
“unsatisfactory” ones as not promoted, the question arises,
-P-A-G-E-329
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 329 
How does this estimate of work done at home as graded by the 
parents compare with the estimate of the work done at school 
by these same pupils as graded by the teacher? 
This is a question concerning which most teachers and 
many parents have had occasion to desire some reliable infor- 
mation. Parents have expressed surprise that Johnnie, who 
gave us no trouble whatever at home, should be marked by his 
teacher only 60 in conduct. Often it has been beyond the power 
of teacher, principal, or superintendent, to explain why Mary, 
who recited her history perfectly every night to her father 
should be graded only 65 by her teacher. 
How then does the estimate placed by the parent on the 
child’s home work compare with the teacher’s estimate of the 
work done by the same children at school. The above sum- 
mary affords a basis for answering this as it applied to the 
children of our seventh grades last session. 
Of the total number of grades given by parents for home 
duties 82 per cent. are satisfactory. 
According to the promotion records made out by the teach- 
ers, 83 per cent. of these same children did satisfactory work 
and were promoted last term. 
Per cent. of children doing satisfactory work: 
‘Atmhome(eraded: by: parent) e2—--- 3. .so2o ote co a eee 
At school (graded by teacher) ____ 
This would seem to indicate either that the children do 
slightly better work at school than at home, or that the teach- 
ers place a higher value on the efforts of the children than the 
parents do. 
On the whole, it seems worth noting that, after all, there is 
practically no difference in the two estimates, only one per 
cent. If parents estimate their children correctly, then the 
teachers are not far wrong, and even then their error is in the 
child’s favor. 
The deductions made from this single investigation should 
not be regarded as in any sense conclusive. They are men- 
tioned merely as a basis for further investigation. “One swal- 
low does not make a summer” nor a single investigation war- 
rant any conclusion. 
Doubtless similar investigations have been made in other 
schools in the South and it is hoped that this report may at 
least serve as a basis for comparison. 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
330 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
Among the benefits that seem thus far to have resulted 
from this report may be mentioned: 
1. An increased concern on the part of parents in the 
habits and interests of their children. The fact that so many 
mothers and fathers frankly stated that they could not say in 
what their child was chiefly interested, or what he did best, 
seems to indicate the need of something to direct the thought 
of parents to the analysis of the character and natural tenden- 
cies of their children. 
2. An increased interest on the part of the child in the 
performance of home duties. It is a great thing for the child 
to want to help the parents to do the tasks about home, and any 
additional incentive that the school may offer to this end seems 
worth while. 
8. Too often the industrial work done in our schools seems 
to have little or no connection with the child’s interests at home. 
Under this plan the home becomes the shop, or industrial lab- 
oratory, for the school, and only those things are done which 
need to be done and which have a direct bearing on the life in 
the home. 
4. Emphasis is incidentally placed upon home-making as 
an important habit of the child. 
5. When the home work, not school work done at home, is 
taken into account by the teacher, it becomes dignified in the 
eyes of the pupil. At the same time these tasks come to have 
an educative value and their importance is appreciated by the 
parents. 
6. Finally the home and the school are brought nearer to- 
gether. Mother and father are the teachers, and the teacher 
comes to care for and give credit to the whole child. 
. School work and home work, school play and home play, 
love for parents and respect for teachers and fellow pupils are 
fostered by this further codperation between home and school. 
A HIGH SCHOOL TRAINING COURSE FOR RURAL 
TEACHERS. 
W. K. TATE, COLUMBIA, S. C. 
After all is said and done the fact remains that we can not 
now expect many of our country schools to be taught by teach- 
ers who have received college or normal school training. The
-P-A-G-E-331
     JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 331    
average woman college graduate marries before she has spent 
as much time in the school as she has spent in the college walls. 
Her training course is by no means wasted, but this fact does 
not simplify the problem of those who are endeavoring to find 
trained teachers for the country schools of the State. In re- 
sponse to a question, “What part of your students teach after 
graduation” recently addressed to the colleges of the State, the 
president of a prominent college for girls gave this answer: 
“About fifty per cent. until they find a husband.” Filling up the 
teaching profession is like pouring water into a sieve—it is an 
everlasting makeshift. With the men it is little better. The 
remuneration is so small that very few men can afford to re- 
main in the profession after reaching adult efficiency and re- 
sponsibility. Most of our country teachers are at best high 
school graduates, and we must meet the conditions which actu- 
ally presents itself. If they are to have any special prepara- 
tion for teaching, it must be given in connection with the high 
school. In my opinion the situation imperatively demands a 
short training course for rural teachers in connection with 
selected four-year high schools. In proportion to the expendi- 
ture, this would give the largest immediate returns for the 
country schools. 
The practical training course for elementary teachers of- 
fered in high schools is no new idea. The need for it exists in 
many other States and many have already made provision to 
meet the need. Among the States which have provided for 
such courses are Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, 
Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Ten- 
nessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin. 
I recently saw such a training department in operation in 
Minnesota in connection with a rural high school. - A trained, 
experienced, normal school graduate was in charge of the de- 
partment. Sixteen young women, seniors and post-graduates, 
were preparing for work in the rural schools of the country. 
The training course included practical pedagogy and school 
management and a review of elementary subjects with special 
reference to methods of teaching them. Each student in train- 
ing had every day an hour’s work in observation or practice 
teaching, in the elementary grades of the school or with small 
sections from the lower classes taken to some vacant room, or 
even assigned to a stair-landing or other unoccupied space in   
-P-A-G-E-332
   
   332 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ee 
the buildings. The lessons presented by the practice students 
were prepared after an observation of the regular work of the 
critic teacher. The work of the students which I observed was 
excellent and there was no loss to the pupils taught by them. 
At intervals these young women visited country schools in the 
neighborhood, observed the work under normal country condi- 
tions, and even assisted the regular country tener in her reci- 
tations. After graduation these students are given certificates 
good for two years and most of them go immediately into the 
rural schools of the county and make good teachers from the 
beginning. They enter on their work with little of the flound- 
ering which characterizes the ordinary inexperienced teacher. 
- The average teaching life of a Southern teacher is four 
years. We can not afford to let her spend even one year of this 
time in painful groping or hopeless inefficiency. It may be 
urged that a teacher should complete a college course before 
taking up professional work. This may be true, but we must 
remember that we are dealing with conditions and not with 
theories. As long as our country schools are taught by people 
who have had only a high school training or less, it is nonsense 
to argue that preparation should be delayed till the completion 
of a college course. If our country boys and girls are to have 
satisfactory educational opportunities, something must be done. 
At present, because of lack of preparation, most of our country 
boys and girls are debarred from college scholarships, and con- 
sequently many who because of their country experience would 
make good rural teachers have no opportunity for preparation. 
A girl reared in the city can not enter into full sympathy with 
country conditions and is naturally not inclined to submit to 
the inconveniences which fall to the lot of the country teacher. 
The result tends to perpetuate and accentuate differences which 
are already too great. The high school training course will give 
a measure of relief.

THE LIBRARY AND THE SCHOOL. 
C. D. JOHNSON, MEMPHIS, TENN. 
The subject of codperation between the public library and the 
public school is not one on which anything new can, at present, 
be offered. For the past thirty years, more or less, this subject 
has been discussed at library meetings, and today no meeting of 
librarians, or teachers, or a joint meeting such as this would be 
considered complete without this subject on the program. 
The modern public library is still a very new institution, 
for I mean by the modern public library, the library intended 
for all of the people, as distinguished from the older library 
intended only for the student. As an eminent American libra- 
rian has often stated, “The old store-house library, with its 
collection of books converted into a living fountain of knowl- 
edge.”
-P-A-G-E-334
334 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
This modern public library is usually supported by a pub- 
lic tax, and the main defense of this compulsory tax support of 
the free public library is that it aids in making good citizens, 
in other words that it is an educational institution. 
With the development of the modern public library, the 
librarian realized that his mission was something higher than 
to be a mere custodian of books. He must see that they are 
used, and used wisely and well. It is then very natural that 
the needs of the child should be given very careful considera- 
tion; and that the librarian should look to the school, where all 
children congregate, and where they are taught to read, as a 
field for some of his best efforts in his new position as mis- 
sionary of the book. 
The school gave the library formal recognition as an im- 
portant factor in educational life some fifteen years ago by the 
establishment of a Library Department in the National Edu- 
cational Association, and by the establishment of a similar de- 
partment in this Southern Educational Association a few years 
later. Today the library that is not codperating with the pub- 
lic school is criticised for its lack of progress, for ignoring its 
mission and its duties. Some years ago a well known educator 
made the following statement: ‘The most important duty of 
the public school, beyond teaching the child to read, is to teach 
him what to read and how to read; to introduce him to the 
world of good books, and to give him an ability to discover for 
himself, what is soundest and best in literature.” We all agree 
that education is not for the few years of a child’s school life, 
but for his entire life, and that the definite function of the 
public school is to awaken the child’s interest and to direct his 
efforts as to secure a wise and continual future self education. 
This self education must be carried on through books. Dr. 
Harris has said: “It is through literature that the genius of 
the race, appearing in exceptional individuals, instructs the 
multitude, gets an insight into distinction of good from evil, 
reveals to him his ideals of what ought to be, and elevates the 
banner of his march toward the beautiful good and the beauti- 
ful true.” Therefore, if the reading of good books is so educa- 
tive and so essential to a sound development, this reading must 
be begun during the years of childhood and youth, when the 
interest is so easily aroused, when the mind is open to impres- 
sions, when the sympathies are so keen, when the taste is as
-P-A-G-E-335
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 335 
yet unperverted and the capacity for forming ideals is so strong. 
This is the time for wise and skillful guidance in the use of 
books. The reading habit is acquired in childhood, and if the 
love for the best in literature comes at all, it will come in child- 
hood, so that what the libraries and schools are giving the boys 
and girls of today in the shape of literature is naturally given 
to the man and woman of the future. (I quote from a well 
known educator): ‘Thus it devolves upon the school to see to 
it that the best and most suitable books are placed before the 
child, and that his interest is aroused in such a way that he 
will read them; and still further, that he will read them in 
such a way that there may be formed in him a correct taste for 
books and a correct reading habit, which he may ever take with 
him, as the most precious gift of the school system, and which 
he will inevitably transmit, at least in some degree, to the gen- 
erations following him. I should like to see this study of lit- 
erature the very center around which the work of the school 
revolves. I would have a course of study so arranged that the 
child may devote much of the time, which so many schools now 
give to the spiritless and uncomprehending acquisition of the 
dead and dissociated Gradgrind facts to the flesh and blood and 
life of the never-dying masterpieces of his mother-tongue. I 
would have him, from the first possible moment, begin to real- 
ize that there is a world outside the sphere of his small activi- 
ties, that there is a glorious past of which he has been heir, and 
that the world and that past have left to him for the asking, 
treasures which he can here and now begin to gather, but whose 
infinite richness he can never exhaust. And I would have him 
so directed that during his whole life’s reading he may, both 
artistically and ethically, learn to know the good from the bad, 
and become accustomed of his own knowledge and volition to 
choose the good because it is good, and to reject the bad because 
it is bad.” : 
These are high ideals and if they are to be attained, schools 
must have books—not the few reference works or the supple- 
mentary text-books which the school library is able to supply— 
but books far in excess of these, and the public library must 
furnish them. 
Unfortunately, in practical life, those who plan courses of 
study in the schools, do not value reading to the extent quoted 
above. In practice, every moment of the teacher’s time seems
-P-A-G-E-336
  
  336 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
occupied, and it is generally left to the library to seek this active 
codperation which should exist. The library being the younger 
and least understood institution, it is quite natural that it 
should make the first move in this matter; but to secure this 
codperation it must have something definite to offer. Teach- 
ers cannot be expected to embrace this work, because it would 
be a good thing for the library, and an easy way to increase its 
circulation. There are still some teachers who imagine that the 
library’s plans for codperation are but a scheme for making 
them do library work. To interest the teachers, to make the 
library a necessity to them, the librarian can safely say that 
(I quote here from a prominent librarian’s remarks on this 
subject) : 
First, that the library will add to the attractiveness of the 
class-room. Every teacher wants her pupils to love to come to 
school, and knows that it is far easier to teach happy, interested 
children than impatient or listless ones. The library will add 
interest. It will help to make the school-room a place of joy 
and happiness. 
Second, the library will incite to interest in and make 
more easy the course of study. It will illustrate and explain 
the subjects taken up. 
Third, it will increase the mind capacity of the pupils, in- 
creasing their ability to acquire knowledge. 
Fourth, it will establish a new relation between pupil and 
teacher, a more personal relation; one in which the one in com- 
mand gives place to the counsellor and friend. 
Fifth, good teachers regret that they have to deal with their 
classes en masse; that they have to hew all to a line—to form 
all in the same mould. Here is something that will foster in- 
dividuality without interfering with routine. Here is the op- 
portunity for the child of exceptional abilities to rise above the 
level insisted upon in school, and to receive help, stimulus, and 
instruction in the line of his individual taste. Here is a means 
by which the teacher may discover a taste or capacity in the 
child, which, wisely fed, may illuminate not only his school life, 
but his whole existence. 
There are many other advantages which can be urged in 
definite cases where generalities are not enough; when you are 
not attempting to establish a proposition or theory, but seeking
-P-A-G-E-337
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 337 
to awaken individual interest, and each such case will call for 
specific consideration and application. 
From the teachers themselves, the library with which the 
writer is connected, has received some of the best arguments 
for the use of library books in schools. Teachers have said that 
it would be almost impossible for them to teach now without 
the aid of the library. One of the strongest arguments is that 
a child who is in many ways uncontrollable can often be reached 
through a book as in no other way. In other words, after his 
interest is once secured, it is a very easy matter to change it to 
other subjects. This was brought very forcibly to my attention 
by a principal of the school for delinquents. Teachers have said 
that they can always tell children who use library books. They 
are better pupils, they can express themselves better, and their 
fund of information is greatly increased. 
There are many ways in which libraries and schools work to- 
gether, but my remarks apply to but one form of library and 
school coéperation, i. e. the sending out of class room libraries to 
the public schools, a work which is done in nearly all of the large 
city libraries. I will barely mention the sending out of sets of 
supplementary readers, the furnishing of reference books, the 
use of the library by school pupils in search for material for 
essays, debates, and the like; the use of the museum by school 
children; the visits of the teachers with their classes, and the 
suggestions to the pupils on the use of the catalogs, reference 
works and reference lists. All of these phases of library work 
with schools are very important, but deserve special treatment 
in themselves, and I repeat, my remarks apply to the use of 
library books in schools and through the teachers. I do not wish 
to belittle these other phases of the work, for after all every 
form of codperation with the school is made with the direct pur- 
pose of interesting the child in the library and giving him what 
is usually called the “library habit.” We want him to be so ac- 
quainted with the library that it will be a live institution to him 
the rest of his life, and I think this is the highest aim that we 
can have. 
I shall digress a moment, and tell of the work done in the 
library with which I am connected. It began about fourteen 
years ago, when it was realized that the teacher needed special 
privileges. The work developed until it reached the position 
where we would lend each teacher, within reason, practically all 
22 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
  338 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
of the books needed to supplement and illustrate her class room 
work. Then gradually the teachers began to secure books to be 
loaned to her pupils, which had no relation to the studies. As 
organized now, at the beginning of the school year, the teacher 
comes to the library, and selects from our shelves, ten, twenty- 
five or fifty books.. Some of these may be to supplement her 
grade work, but in many cases they are simply good literature. 
These books are under her absolute control. She may permit 
them to be used in the class room; she may permit the pupils to 
take them home; with but one restriction; we do request that 
these books be not used for rewards or punishments. We be- 
lieve that the bad boy needs his book just as much as the good 
boy. We urge the teachers to permit the pupils to take the 
books home, but it is left to her discretion. Very many parents 
become interested in the library through books which their chil- 
dren have borrowed through their teachers. In the school year 
1912 and 19138, 12,000 books were loaned to the schools. These 
books were loaned 32,662 times for home use and were used 
147,662 times in the class rooms. These figures are given from 
reports turned in by the teachers. It was the first year that we 
required the teachers to give these monthly reports and we have 
since found out that there were a great many more books used 
and issued for which we did not receive reports, some of the 
teachers not fully understanding the use of the blank forms 
which we sent out. The library has a special assistant who 
looks after this work, and visits are made from time to time to 
the schools to keep before the teachers the work the library is 
trying to do. 
These books which are sent out to the teachers may be 
kept by the teachers for the entire term, but are subject to recall 
if necessary. They may be changed as often as necessary. We 
have a very large collection of duplicates for this work to which 
regular additions are being made. The library also has quite 
a number of sets for supplementary reading which at one time 
were sent out and transferred from school to school. These are 
now loaned only to the teachers requesting them, and all of the 
work is now voluntary work on the part of the teachers. We 
have made especial effort to supply books for the primary 
grades, for those who compile school statistics tell us that over 
half of the school children drop out of school before they are 
twelve years of age, and this shows clearly, if we are to do
-P-A-G-E-339
           339    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 
anything for the great majority, we must do it in the lower 
grades. If we can impress on the children, who leave school so 
early, the love of good books before they leave, the library when 
they have left school, gives them the opportunity to continue 
their education through life. 
It might be of interest to mention here that the library 
has recently employed an educated negro woman to supervise 
and encourage this very line of work in the Negro schools of 
Memphis. This city was probably one of the first cities in the 
South which provided separate facilities for the Negro. A 
branch for them is located in a normal school, and does excel- 
lent work; but we felt that if the library really wants to do 
some active work among the Negroes, something that might 
count in making them better citizens, it ought to be done with 
the children, and in the public schools. 
In conclusion, as a librarian, I wish to state that this school 
work is in many ways better worth the doing than any other 
line of the library’s activities. 
HOW TO MAKE THE PUBLIC LIBRARY MORE SERVICE- 
ABLE TO CHILDREN OF SCHOOL AGE. 
D. C. HULL, MERIDIAN, MISS. 
It is not the purpose of this paper to argue the necessity of 
arousing an interest in reading, of forming the reading habit, 
or of guiding the student in the right choice of books. These 
things are admitted. Nor shall any attempt be made to make 
original or new suggestions. The whole field has been explored 
so thoroughly that such an attempt is not only unnecessary but 
for the author of this paper at least is impossible. In this time 
of rapid multiplication of libraries, the thing needed is not new 
ideas but clear statement of a few of the best things that have 
already been devised and tested. 
As a prerequisite of all plans for greater library service, 
I would insist upon the complete codperation of all the forces 
concerned. When the chairman of a certain library board was 
recently asked to approve a well known plan of codperation 
between library and school his reply was, “Why, if we do that 
thing, the schools will get all the credit for it.” The librarian’s 
reply exhibited the spirit that must prevail if the library is to    
    
-P-A-G-E-340
  340 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
render the maximum service. She said: “What should we 
care for credit, so the children get the books and read them?” 
This spirit of willingness to serve regardless of whether 
proper credit is given must be characteristic of superintendent, 
teacher, librarian, and boards of trustees; for, although a plan 
of codperation can easily be devised that will give “tribute to 
whom tribute is due,” yet there is nothing so paralyzing to 
effective codperation as being perpetually on guard lest another 
be praised for what we have done. But with the desire for 
service dominant, there will come an imperative spirit of self- 
sacrifice which will remove all obstacles to the effective work- 
ing together of all interests for good to the children. 
Impelled by this spirit, the superintendent will codperate 
by bringing the library and its plans of work to the attention 
of the teachers so as to arouse their interest and secure their 
help. He will be willing to assist in the preparation of book 
lists suitable for the various uses of school children. He will 
give counsel and help in devising proper plans for the distribu- 
tion and exchange of books. As the leader of the educational 
forces of the community, he will exert himself to place the influ- 
ence of the schools squarely back of the public library in its 
efforts to procure funds for the purchase of the kind of books 
the schools need. 
Under the influence of the same spirit, the teachers will 
codperate by being alive to the importance of the library’s mis- 
sion, to the immense help it is capable of rendering them in 
their work. They will keep themselves thoroughly informed 
of the books available, and will stimulate the interest of their 
pupils by repeatedly directing their attention to the library. 
They will further show a spirit of coéperation by faithfully and 
diligently using the books sent to their grade rooms, by incul- 
eating a spirit of reverence for books to the end of guarding 
them from abuse, and by reassembling and returning all books 
to the library in the best possible condition. 
The librarian, if he has been properly selected, will almost 
surely have the proper spirit of codperation. It must of neces- 
sity be so. Almost any plan of larger library service, above 
all that superintendent and teacher may do or be expected to 
do, will depend in the final analysis upon the librarian. He is 
the heart of the library system. Its streams of usefulness will 
flow outward no more strongly than he propels them. If he be
-P-A-G-E-341
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 341 
   
    
       
   
     
   
    
                                       
    
        
      
                
   phlegmatic and inactive, little good will come. If he have in- 
itiative, tact, energy, and zeal, the library will perforce accom- 
plish its mission. 
First of all the librarian will be familiar with books. He 
will not only know them, but will love them. He will be a dis- 
criminating judge of their merits, and will select them with a 
clear vision of their effect upon children. He will be able thus 
not only to bring the children of the schools into sympathetic 
companionship with good books, but to shield them from the 
inferior and the vicious. Moreover, he will know the teachers 
with whom he is to deal and through whom he is to work. He 
will realize the tremendous leverage they afford him for lifting 
the reading population, young and old, into the companionship 
of great minds. He will arouse their interest in the purposes 
of the library and will acquaint them with its plans. He will 
meet them in groups and instruct them kindly and thoroughly 
in methods of using the library and will induce them to trans- 
mit this instruction to their pupils. He will secure their ef- 
fective codperation in inducing the smaller children to attend 
the “story hour’ where talented men and women are easily pre- 
vailed upon to entertain and instruct them with interesting and 
wholesome stories. To the same end the teachers will be in- 
duced to direct their pupils to the “children’s corner” where 
the librarian will have arranged special collections of books, 
papers, and pictures suited to their interests and answering to 
their needs. Finally the librarian will have printed and dis- 
tributed occasionally in the various grade rooms bulletins call- 
ing attention to new books of special interest, to all books bear- 
ing upon the several subjects of the curriculum, and to other 
phases of his work to which he deems it advisable to invite at- 
tention. He will also print and distribute lists of books suit- 
able for use in the various grades, for reference, for supple- 
mentary reading in class, and for general distribution through 
the school for reading in the home. 
In conclusion I beg to quote from a bulletin recently issued 
by the librarian at Jacksonville, Fla., outlining an effective and 
far reaching plan. 
“Through books we may become intimately acquainted with the wisest 
and greatest men and women of all ages; and, through these acquaintances, 
we are helped to form higher ideals and to get nobler thoughts. In school 
children should be so trained that they will choose only the best of these
-P-A-G-E-342
  342 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
people for their reading companions. This is the purpose of the school 
library. To do this, it must contain books that the child likes to read, for 
only the book the child enjoys influences him. He should be allowed a cer- 
tain freedom in making his selection, as he will have to do his own choosing 
after he leaves school. But with this free access to the books there should 
be the personal guidance of the teacher. Thus we must have a graded 
library in each room of our schools to best foster this work. The public 
library aims to assist the school in this work by giving to each of its 
classes a collection of 70 books for the use of the teacher and for the chil- 
dren’s home reading. Each of these libraries consists of 35 copies of a 
supplementary reader for school use and 35 different titles for home circu- 
lation. In selecting these libraries the opinions of experienced teachers, as 
well as the courses of study followed in our public schools, have been con- 
sulted. Among the books are standard works of literature, accounts of the 
lives of famous men, stories of history and of foreign lands, stories of ani- 
mals and birds, fairy tales and a number of popular juvenile novels. Many 
of the books can be used in two or more grades. Thus the teacher of the 
fifth grade may often choose a fourth or sixth grade library. 
“The books are packed in a combination book and packing case. This 
case of three shelves is an ordinary stained box with a front cover, which 
fastens on with a simple hinge and lock. An expressman delivers and re- 
turns all libraries at the regular bi-monthly trip free of charge to the 
school. When a teacher has made a request for a certain library it is sent 
to her at the following bi-monthly change, provided there are no prior re- 
quests for it. The case is kept in the class room, where the children have 
free access to the books under the eye of the teacher or the appointed 
librarian from among the children. 
“The supplementary reader is used by the teacher for work in the 
school. As there are 35 copies of this book, every child has a book for 
reading or study. The other 35 books are loaned to the children for home 
reading. 
“In charging the books for home use the simplest method is used. 
With each library is a series of cards on a strong cord, one card for each 
book. These cards, bearing the author and the title, are arranged in alpha- 
betical order. When the pupil takes a book from the case for home reading 
his name is entered on the corresponding card, and on the return of the 
book the acting librarian’s initials are written opposite the borrower’s name. 
“The first card on this cord is a title card for the library. Instructions 
for keeping of circulation records, the name of the school, class and 
teacher, and the date on which the public library will send for this school 
library, appears.on this card. 
“At the close of the school year all libraries are returned to the main 
library, and the statistics compiled for the year, condition of the books 
noted, and all changes made that seem to be advisable. The books are 
carded and the libraries placed in the children’s room, where all the books 
are available for home circulation during the summer months, In this 
manner we are able to keep the books of the school libraries separate from 
our general books, and at the same time use them for home circulation 
during the months our schools are closed.”

THE ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF A 
HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY. 
J. H. PHILLIPS, BIRMINGHAM, ALA. 
In the treatment of this topic, we must at the outset rec- 
ognize the fact that library conditions in all communities are 
not the same, and that library aims and methods in the high 
schools of our rural districts need not be identical with those 
of our village and city high schools. This variety of conditions 
will not admit of any specific prescription applicable to all high 
schools. If we have in view a private high school or academy, 
we have before us one set of conditions; if we are dealing with 
a rural or county high school, we have another set of condi- 
tions; if we have in mind a village high school, which is an 
organic part of the public school system of the community, we 
are confronted by still other conditions, and if we have in mind 
the high schools in our larger cities, where public libraries ex- 
ist for the benefit of the entire community, the library prob- 
lem, both from the standpoint of organization and of adminis- 
tration, assumes an entirely different aspect. 
The time allotted for this paper will not admit of the treat- 
ment of the high school library under all these varying condi- 
tions. I shall therefore confine myself to a discussion of the 
high school library as it relates to our village and city schools, 
assuming that these high schools, organically connected as in- 
tegral parts of their respective community school systems, con- 
stitute a majority of the high schools of our Southern States. 
Perhaps I can serve this department at this time in no bet- 
ter way than by presenting a brief historical sketch of the li- 
brary work of one community during its passage from the stage 
of a village of 3,000 inhabitants to that of a city of more than 
150,000 population. As this community happens to be my own 
city, my only apology shall be that it is the one with whose library 
Iam most familiar. The ideals and methods presented by a con- 
crete illustration of library development, covering a period of 
more than twenty-five years, may contain suggestions of value es- 
pecially to those in charge of village or town schools. 
We shall begin with a small straggling village, crude and un- 
promising, without any of the conveniences or adornments that 
an up-to-date village could boast of possessing twenty-five years 
ago. Its public schools were just organized, but the limited re- 
   
-P-A-G-E-344
    344 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
sources at the disposal of the Board of Education would not jus- 
tify the expenditure even of a small amount for the purchase of 
books. There was no library in the village, and the people were so 
strenuously employed in the business of making a living that they 
had no time to consider the question. The teachers of the village, 
under the leadership of the superintendent, undertook the task of 
establishing a library in connection with the high school. With 
the proceeds of school entertainments, a few books were pur- 
chased and placed in a room adjoining the superintendent’s office 
in the high school building. Other entertainments were given, 
and by means of the proceeds, the library within a year could 
boast of three hundred well selected volumes, including diction- 
aries, cyclopedias and other books of reference, together with a 
number of pedagogical books and magazines for teachers. Small 
as this library was at this stage of its development, it was con- 
sidered an essential part of the working equipment of the high 
school. But its use was not confined to the high school and the 
teachers. Juvenile books were added and six elementary libraries 
of one hundred volumes each were formed; one of these subsid- 
iary libraries was sent to each of the half dozen elementary 
schools, each library remaining in the school for six weeks, 
when it would be replaced by another library. AJl the element- 
ary schools of the little city thus had the benefit of the six hun- 
dred volumes during the year. All the teachers and all the pu- 
pils in this manner became interested in the development of the 
library. Each of the schools of the city gave one public enter- 
tainment each year for the benefit of the library, and for a 
period of ten years, the proceeds of these entertainments aver- 
aged more than $1,000.00 a year. Through the interest of 
teachers and pupils, parents began to take an interest in the 
work, and many donations in books or money were received. 
When the building provided for the high school and the 
library became overcrowded, a larger building was obtained 
and larger quarters were provided for the library. The refer- 
ence department was enlarged and the leading magazines and 
periodicals of the day found a place on the reading room tables. 
Up to this time there had been no librarian; the superin- 
tendent with the aid of the teachers and pupils of the high school 
attended to all the details. The Board of Education authorized 
the employment of a librarian; the use of the library was 
thrown open to the public upon the payment of a small mem-
-P-A-G-E-345
           345 
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 
bership fee, and the interest in library development on the part 
of the general public was considerably stimulated. The library, 
however, was still dependent upon the schools for the funds 
necessary to secure books and provide literature for the read- 
ing rooms. 
In a comparatively short space of time, the growth of the 
library and of the high school made it impossible to accommo- 
date both in the same building. An entire floor in the new 
municipal building was especially designed for the use of the 
library, which was henceforth designated as the City Public 
Library. The library was made free to all the people, and three 
librarians were employed to conduct the work. By this time, 
the library had increased to 15,000 volumes and its reference 
department and bound magazines constituted one of the most 
valuable features. In its growth and development, the people 
of the community took an important part and contributed sev- 
eral thousands of dollars for the purchase of books, but the 
conception of the library began with the school, and its growth 
was due very largely to the persistent efforts of the teachers. 
The removal of the library from the high school building, 
the establishment of a second high school, and the annexation 
of several suburban towns, led the way to another stage of 
library development. Some of the annexed towns had already 
established small libraries; these became branches of the cen- 
tral library. The Board of Education now had in charge the 
administration of a library system including the central library 
and four branch libraries, containing a total of 30,000 volumes. 
After administering this system for three years, the Board of 
Education transferred the library management, on the first 
day of last July, to a special library commission, created by the 
city authorities. The small nucleus of a library planted twenty- 
five years ago is now recognized as a special department of our 
municipal government, involving an annual expenditure of not 
less than $20,000.00. 
In the meantime, each of the public school buildings of the 
city has set aside a special library room, containing a well se- 
lected list of books suitable to the needs of the school. Each of 
the city high schools is rapidly developing its own library to 
meet the specific needs of class room work. The school libraries 
of the city today number nearly 10,000 volumes. In the Central 
High School, an average of more than one hundred and fifty dol-
-P-A-G-E-346
  346 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
lars per annum has been invested in books during the past five 
years. The funds are obtained from entertainments given from 
time to time by the several classes. Since a close relation exists 
between the public library system of the city and the high schools, 
it is unnecessary to provide facilities for general and miscel- 
laneous reading in the high school libraries. The ideal of the 
high school library is therefore that of a comprehensive refer- 
ence library rather than that of a library for miscellaneous 
reading. Each department in the school—english, mathematics, 
history, science, manual arts, music, household economics, etc., 
—at the close of each year submits a list of the books desired 
as aids in that department. 
In each high school, a large and commodious room is set 
apart for the use of the library and reading rooms. A trained 
librarian, employed by the Board of Education, is placed in 
charge, and the library is used not simply as an adjunct for the 
mere pleasure or convenience of the pupils, but as an organic 
factor in the work of the schools. The heads of the several 
departments and instructors of the high school assign specific 
readings or research work for their classes in connection with 
their studies, and each student entering the library files with 
the librarian a slip containing the name of the student, his class 
and the title of the book or books prescribed. Reference books 
such as lexicons, dictionaries, general encyclopedias, biograph- 
ical cyclopedias, historical reference works and atlases, are 
found on the library tables accessible to all students. Any other 
books desired or prescribed are indicated upon the slip filed with 
the librarian who devotes all her time in aiding students in their 
reading and research work. 
The high school library thus becomes an essential part of the 
high school course, and is organically connected with all of its de- 
partments. The same restrictions obtain in the library as in the 
study room, and library periods may be assigned to pupils just as 
they are assigned recitation periods or study hours. The various 
literary, musical, dramatic and other organizations of the school 
find the library of inestimable value. The voluntary use of the 
library before school hours in the morning and after school hours 
in the evening, show a gratifying increase from year to year. 
The library rooms of the high school are frequently filled in the 
afternoons by students who are interested in special debates 
or other work connected with their voluntary school organiza- 
tions.

This story of library achievement in and through the school 
applies to the several stages of community development, from 
the crude village stage to that of a flourishing city. Its first 
lesson bears upon the importance of having a library purpose 
and a library ideal. The second lesson is that of persistent ad- 
herence to that purpose, and the intelligent readjustment of 
methods and policies to the changing conditions of community 
life. 
THE TRAINING OF A HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARIAN. 
MISS MARY SKIFFINGTON, NASHVILLE, TENN. 
The standard of education for many years consisted of the 
elementary “Three R’s.,” ‘Readin’, Riten and Rithmetic!” It 
is the belief of the modern librarian that this curriculum might 
even be reduced to the Two-R’s, i. e. to “Readin’ and Riten,” 
with the emphasis on the “Readin,” for intelligent reading is 
the basis of all study in all branches of learning, and writing 
is the expression of the result of intelligent reading. How- 
ever, progress in secondary education is being made with in- 
creasing rapidity, for the number of high schools increased 
9 per cent. and the number of students in them increased 50 
per cent. during the last four years. It is estimated that 23 
per cent. of the children of this generation in the United States 
receive some education in the high school. 
The problem is how best to develop emphasis on, and in- 
terest in, the major study of the course, i. e., on reading, so 
that the instruction shall contribute surely and directly to- 
wards producing a mind trained to reason exactly, and vitally 
quickened towards a serious purpose to learn more, and to 
serve better. In other words the training must be both text- 
ual and inspirational. The agency for the former is the teacher, 
for the latter is the library and the librarian, for it is with the 
inspirational part of education that libraries and librarians 
deal. 
The high school period of a boy’s and girl’s life is the 
plastic period because it is the time of dreams, visions and 
ideals. The previous years have been filled with the effort to 
acquire familiarity with the tools and circumstances of life, 
with the emergence of a conscious individuality; about now the 
emergence is complete and a new horizon obtained. There is in
-P-A-G-E-348
  348 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
each youth new indefinite stirrings of consciousness, as I said, 
dreams and visions ill defined. What shall be the food of this 
expanding spirit, and how shall the dreams and visions concrete 
themselves into ideals toward which character shall tend? 
In all ages and stages of human experience there have been 
visions seen, and ideals realized; these have been recorded in 
action, or expressed in loning, rythm and rhyme and make the 
literature of the race. Literature the expression of ideals, 
dreams and visions of the race, art and architecture the visual- 
ization of the sense and appreciation of beauty, history. The story 
of individual and race effort must be put into the thought of 
youth, and the hesitant, fluttering spirit will try its wings in em- 
ulation and tend toward the empyrean heights before the storms 
of life have darkened and narrowed its horizon. This is the work 
preeminently of the library and librarian. Are not the qualities 
of the high school librarian depicted in the demands of the 
work? One versed in literature, art and history as related to 
the past and present, and visioning the future; one who has 
not yet ceased to dream of an ultimate goal of good, and who 
sees with smiles and tears those standing radiant, or without 
fire, upon the threshold of life. 
The high school librarian should have a high school course 
that she may know the attitude of the high school student and 
the technical and literary demands of the course of study; this 
should be followed by a college course for further mental dis- 
cipline and broader vision of the educational world. There 
should be, too, a course in the technique of library administra- 
tion which would oil the wheels of the inspirational school that 
the librarian is to administer when she takes charge of a high 
school library. A love for reading should be a natural en- 
dowment and this taste should be indulged wisely and well. All 
this will require time and yet there must be in every high school 
librarian youth, youth of spirit and of mind, coupled with the 
wisdom of the sage. 
The course in the technique of library administration 
should begin in the high school itself. In the first year of the 
course acquaintance should be made with the use of the library 
catalog and the primary reference books, and the location of 
the supplementary books reserved for that year’s work. Brief 
biographies of the writers of the text-books used and of selected 
books from the supplementary reserve should be assigned, thus 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 349 
making real to the student the authors, and identifying them 
as men and women who are saying something of importance to 
them that they need to know. This will vivify the texts and 
make them of more value in the mind of the student. During 
the second year the work should be of the same type, but more 
extensive. Reference work should become more advanced in 
the third and fourth years; types of reference books should be 
studied, such as encyclopedias, dictionaries and atlases, and 
differentiated as general and special, as to subject and as to 
locality. Book selection should be introduced in a very simple 
way and based upon the biography of the author. It may be 
concretely illustrated by some such question as “Why is Myer’s 
General History used as your text book? Who is he?” Bibli- 
ography should be introduced by calling attention to the bibli- 
ographies in the texts and requiring short bibliographical lists 
from the high school library collection. The system of cata- 
loging used in the library ‘should be studied in the fourth year 
and a set of twenty-five or more books catalogued; care being 
taken to select books that would involve only the simple rules 
of cataloging. This course of study should be given in every 
high school, and if the student should wish to become a high 
school librarian it should be followed by a course in some of 
the standard schools for librarians such as Albany, Pratt, 
Simmons and the University of Illinois. Each of these schools 
bases its entrance on the college entrance requirements and re- 
quire from three to four years study before granting a degree. 
I shall not undertake to discuss the courses of these schools, 
but recommend that the standard of equipment for a high 
school librarian be placed as high as that of these schools. 
There is no field of the profession more fertile for good and 
immediate results than is that of the high school librarian. 
DEPARTMENT OF KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION. 
PRESIDENT—Miss HorTENSE M. Orcutt, Savannah, Ga. 
VICE-PRESIDENT—MISS EDWINA Woop, Columbus, Ga. 
SECRETARY—MIss KATE B. HACKNEY, Nashville, Tenn. 
The Department of Kindergarten Education of the South- 
ern Educational Association assembled Friday, October 31, 
1913, at 2:30 P. M., for the first meeting since it became a de- 
partment of the larger organization.
-P-A-G-E-350
  350 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
A large audience filled to overflowing the room in the High 
School building where the session was held. Miss Hortense 
Orcutt, of Savannah, Ga., the President, was in the chair and 
introduced each speaker. 
The first speaker was Miss Netta Faris, Supervisor of Kin- 
dergartens, Cleveland, Ohio, and for some months past a stu- 
dent of the Montessori Schools, Rome, Italy. Miss Faris spoke 
of the kindergartens and the Montessori system—their appli- 
cation to modern educational practice in America. A lively 
discussion followed the clear, able presentation of this subject, 
after which a paper on “The Relation Between the Kinder- 
garten and the Primary School” was read by Miss Agnes Wil- 
son, Supervisor of Kindergartens, Birmingham, Ala. Miss 
Wilson was followed by Miss Lillian Taylor, of Nashville, Tenn., 
who presented the same subject, but from the standpoint of the 
grade teacher. 
After an open discussion in which a number took part, the 
meeting adjourned. 
THE KINDERGARTEN WORK AND ITS RELATIONSHIP 
TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL. 
MISS LILLIAN TAYLOR, NASHVILLE, TENN. 
I have come to talk to you about the kindergarten and its 
relation to the public school. 
In the kindergarten we wish the child, the little human plant, 
to learn to grow and develop in the best way. It is the place 
where the child gets into the right relationship to nature, man 
and God. This should be the aim in both kindergarten and 
public school work. 
One must live near to nature; no man can be a scientist 
who has not as a child lived near to nature’s heart. One who 
had a country experience and knew the bird and meadow peo- 
ple as his friend. : 
Everyone should get into the right relationship to his fel- 
lowman; none of us can live to ourselves; the great commun- 
ity life means more and more. By respecting the rights and 
privileges of others the child becomes a good citizen at six or 
seven years. 
The kindergarten teaches us the use of the hands and the 
child learns to respect all work and all workers, and to have a
-P-A-G-E-351
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 351 
loving sympathy for all people who are helping to do the nec- 
essary work of the world. 
By their association with each other they forget to be 
timid, the selfish children become unselfish, and they also learn 
self control. Once in my kindergarten a little boy of five found 
a bird and was eager to take it to his home. 
My assistant was standing by and told of the sorrow of 
the mother bird if it were not returned to the nest. His face 
was a study, as you could see the conflicting emotions of the 
desire for the bird and the desire to do right. At last he took 
the bird to its nest and was radiant with happiness that he had 
conquered himself. The children are taught to reverence home, 
to be polite, cheerful, thankful, and to be pure and true as the 
knights of old, and like the knights each takes as a motto for life, 
“T serve.” 
Children are put in the right relationship to God. In every- 
thing there is a way to God. They all bow to Him in thankful- 
ness for the rest and care He has given them. When they study 
about the farmer they are glad to trace the growth of everything 
back to the rain and sunshine and to God who gave both. 
“Whoever plants a seed beneath the sod 
And waits to see it push away the clod 
Trusts in God.” 
In Europe and America we have found that by utilizing the 
early years of childhood, crime is prevented, creative art is devel- 
oped, and a love for work engendered. 
In this day so much is made of gardening, and corn clubs. 
Where did they get the idea? From the kindergarten. 
We hear so much of the public play grounds, yet until the 
kindergarten spirit was abroad in the land, people had forgotten 
that children needed to play, and that through play, rightly di- 
rected, the child could be helped to happiness and better living. 
We bear much of manual training today, but a few years 
ago we did not have any manual training in our schools, except in 
the kindergarten, while now we have it in every grade, and in our 
primary work we have the paper folding, mat weaving, cutting, 
etc., that has been directly borrowed from the kindergarten. All 
good things that have come to the public school, gardening, na- 
ture study, morning talks, the story hour, the dramatizing of 
stories, manual training, mothers’ meetings, were in the kinder- 
 
-P-A-G-E-352
  352 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
garten first and were borrowed from it. So the best preparation 
for school life is to go to a good kindergarten, for the best public 
schools are following the principles and ideals of kindergarten 
work. 
The home, the kindergarten and the public schools should all 
be in harmony and there should be no break in the educational 
life of the child. 
To the kindergarten child entrance into school life is but 
a step, for he has acquired habits of obedience, order, self con- 
trol, and industry. He has learned to do things in an orderly 
way. He has learned to work quietly at whatever is given him 
to do. The kindergarten child will go into school with a habit 
of work that he will put into practice in his reading and writ- 
ing. He has also learned to observe and think, and has clear 
ideas of form, number, position, direction, and an ability to 
express himself. 
He has had the joy of companionship with other children 
and has learned from them the lesson of each for all and all 
for each, that later will develop into a practical brotherhood of 
man. 
Katherine Beebe says, “The kindergarten affords the best 
transition from home to school life, is the best preparation for 
school life, and it strives to prepare the child not only for time 
but for eternity, by enabling him to grow into what he can be 
and what God wants him to be.” 
Mr. James Head, a former Mayor of Nashville, said: “I 
would rather have put the kindergarten in the public schools 
of Nashville, than anything else in my administration.” 
My friend, Mrs. Francis McCauley, who wrote “The Lady 
of the Decoration,” and who did such a wonderful work for 
the kindergartens of Japan, said: “When God lacked mothers, 
He made kindergartners.” 
May the day soon come when every woman will be ex- 
pected to have a kindergarten training as a part of her educa- 
tion. For every woman is thrown with children and to help 
them to live useful, high and holy lives is the highest calling 
any woman can have. 
Froebel understood all this when he said, ‘Come, let us 
live with the children,’ but long centuries ago the Prince of 
Teachers realized that all people were happier when they lived 
near to child life and were willing that “A little child should 
lead them.”

DISCUSSION. 
MISS AGNES WILSON, BIRMINGHAM, ALA. 
The presentation by Miss Faris of the aims, principles and 
practice in modern education which have come to us from the 
influence of the kindergarten, and have also been emphasized 
in some important respects by Madam Montessori as the last 
word on the subject, has brought to us very forcibly the truth 
that the education of young children consists largely of the 
development of latent powers and capacities through the call- 
ing out of self activity and social service, instead of the giving 
of that knowledge which is first gotten from books. The pa- 
rents who are disappointed because their children are not learn- 
ing to read and write in the kindergarten often become recon- 
ciled to that fact when they notice the happiness of the chil- 
dren, and the evicences of new mental life together with an 
awakening to new deals in social adjustment and kindly serv- 
ice suitable to a child. 
As the tendency today in education, as elsewhere, is to stress 
efficiency for life alike from the utilitarian, social and spiritual 
aspects, it may be well to consider the special preparation 
which makes the kindergarten child efficient when he enters 
school. 
That the discussion may not be purely theoretical, I will 
mention the facts which have been gathered from experience 
with children whose progress in school has been followed for 
three or four years after leaving the kindergarten. Conceding 
that the time has not been long enough, nor the investigations 
extensive enough to admit of final conclusions, the facts indi- 
cate that educators should carefully consider the possibilities 
of kindergarten training as a ‘preparation for early \school 
work. : 
The testimony from the grade teachers and the principals 
from some of the schools in Birmingham, Alabama, in which 
the kindergartens had been tried for several years, was unan- 
imous in the statement that the kindergarten children were 
more responsive than those without that training; that they 
could take directions better and needed less time for drill in 
mechanical details; that hand work and number work were 
better; and that they had had experience through excursions and 
with real things which gave them sensory images and a stock 
23
-P-A-G-E-354
  354 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
of ideas from which to draw for oral expression and the teach- 
ing of new words. They also had better muscular control and 
could earily learn the games requiring rhythmical movements 
and concerted action. The social and moral values were not 
lost sight of, but as they were not required for promotion in the 
grades, they will not be traced. 
In one school, eighty-five children entered school from the 
kindergarten during four years, and 75 per cent. of these chil- 
dren had averages higher than the class average. Six of the 
children were double promoted twice. Two sub-normal chil- 
dren failed, but even then gained a year’s time because a brother 
of one with about the same mentality spent three years in the 
same grade. 
In another school, where thirty-one of the strongest chil- 
dren were placed in Grade I A with a good teacher, fourteen 
were promoted to Grade II at the end of the first half year, 
and ten of the fourteen were kindergarten children. The next 
year with thirty-five children, nine of the thirteen who were 
promoted in February were kindergarten children. Of the 
total number that were promoted during the two years, all did 
regular work except four who were double-promoted and one 
who failed. 
One principal who had studied the kindergarten closely re- 
ported the importance of activity for activity’s sake and the 
resultant influence upon health. He also spoke of the value of 
discipline secured through freedom and self control rather than 
by external authority. He saw the values in home and social 
life which are emphasized in the kindergarten, but in relation 
to the question of promotion, I will quote Mr. E. E. Smith of 
the Martin School: “The time gained in kindergarten is 
easily computed. While our school has not tabulated in detail 
every case, yet it is safe to assure that a normal child may 
easily expect to gain one-half year of actual grade work during 
the first three years of school. In other words, two years and 
a half after entering grade school, the child should expect to 
be ready for the fourth grade. More often it is that a child 
finds himself entering second grade at the end of one-half year 
of grade work. The discipline secured in kindergarten has 
served to save him time. The adjustments he has made while in 
kindergarten enable him to quickly adjust himself to first grade, 
so that we find very occasionally in these early grades a child
-P-A-G-E-355
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS 365 
whose ability justifies more rapid development, and in almost 
every case these children are children who received proper 
training in the kindergarten before entering the grade school.” 
The fact that the lower grades are flexible enough to per- 
mit each child to find a suitable adjustment is particularly sig- 
nificant for the advancement of the kindergarten child who has 
had the advantage of concrete number work, oral expression, 
stories, dramatization of stories, hand work, music, rhythmical 
exercises and drawing. He is at a little disadvantage for dou- 
ble promotion at the beginning of the term on account of not 
having had the symbols for writing and number work and in 
not having had phonics. The advisability of giving this spe- 
cial preparation to the group of older children who will be 
ready for the first grade at the beginning of the following term 
is being considered. Most of the kindergarten children in Bir- 
mingham are six years old as they do not enter school until 
seven years of age, and the older children are given the pref- 
erence in the kindergarten. This removes the objection that 
might arise to giving school work to children under six years of 
age. 
Heredity and environment have much to do with the re- 
tardation and promotion of kindergarten children as with all 
others, and the successful double promotions have been most 
frequent with the children from well favored homes. In one 
instance where some kindergarten children failed of promo- 
tion in the fourth grade, the principal attributed the fact to ill- 
nourished bodies and unfortunate home influences rather than 
to fault in their school training. 
The principal from the normal school reported the chil- 
dren from the kindergarten under her observation very much 
stronger in the first grade than those without the training, so 
even if children are not double promoted, or if they have had 
little help from home influences, would it not be worth while to 
make the first years in school easier, happier, and richer in 
concepts, though the children did not gain time in years in go- 
ing through school? 
With regard to the teaching of Dr. Montessori, I agree 
with Miss Faris that a contribution to modern educational 
thought has been made, rather than a system organized which 
is destined to supercede what has gone before. The didactic 
materials are too simple for most children over five years of
-P-A-G-E-356
  356 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
age and are better suited to the limited powers of the sub-nor- 
mal child than to the original, inventive, and imaginative child. 
By way of contrast to the Montessori material, the value of the 
building blocks and other materials planned by Froebel lies in 
their endless possibilities of combination and reirrangement 
which permits the giving of outward form to almost any thought 
arising from the child’s environment or concrete experience. 
The emphasis which Dr. Montessori has laid upon the im- 
portance of health and freedom is significant in this day when 
people are ready for such a message. From her standpoint of 
freedom and control on the part of the child, which will have 
to make the greater adjustment—the kindergarten or the 
grades? Are there not some truths commonly accepted by edu- 
ucators today which will help us to test our standards for the 
kindergarten and the school? It seems to me that Dr. Dewey 
has been the spokesman for the tendency to relate the educa- 
tion of the child as closely to life as possible. He has also said 
that the active side precedes the passive in the development of 
child nature, that the sensory image is the great instrument of 
instruction, and that interests are signs and symptoms of dawn- 
ing powers. These are fundamental principles in the kinder- 
garten, but Dr. Dewey has emphasized them as emphatically 
for the grades. If there is failure to recognize these truths in 
the practice of either the kindergarten or the school, the work 
of the one will not supplement that of the other, but when there 
is continuity of method along these lines, perhaps there will 
be no need for distinguishing the names of the two institutions. 
Along this line of codperation I will say that in putting 
the kindergartens into the public schools of Birmingham, it 
seemed necessary to have an organic relation established as 
soon as possible. Beginning with the students in the Training 
School, the plan was to prepare them to understand the funda- 
mental ideas of kindergarten and grade work, even though they 
should specialize later. All of the students take child study, 
kindergarten theory, psychology, and history of education dur- 
ing the first year’s course. Lessons in vocal music, drawing, 
manual arts and primary methods, are given by the supervisors 
of these various departments in the schools. All the students 
are required to take the State Examination and hold a second 
grade certificate which entitles the kindergartners to teach in 
the grades if they should so desire though they specialize in

their own subject during the senior year. The same conform- 
ity to the standards of the schools is expected of the kinder- 
garten teachers and extends to the state certificate and study 
courses for all the teachers. This recognition of similar stand- 
ards and aims leads to better preparation for the first grade in 
the teaching of numbers, language, music, and all phases of 
work and activity, while the grade teacher will know what she 
has to build upon when the kindergarten child comes to her. 
The superintendent of the schools secured better grading 
by regulating the age of admission into the kindergarten and 
by limiting the number with which one teacher could do good 
work. 
It is generally conceded that a teacher of young children 
cannot do her best work with a large group, and when each 
child has a chance to develop his highest possibilities accord- 
ing to the demands of his nature, and when his teachers includ- 
ing the mother, kindergartner, the grade instructor, continu- 
ously observe the laws of developing body, mind, and spirit, 
there will be better results.

  In Memoriam 
SUPERINTENDENT S. A. MYNDERS. 
Prof. S. A. Mynders was born in Northfield, Minn., March 
12, 1861, and moved to Knoxville, Tenn., with his parents in 
August, 1866. He graduated from the University of Tennessee 
at the age of 18 and began teaching at Haton, Tenn. He later 
taught at Humbolt and Lexington, and was superintendent of 
the Jackson City Schools for a number of years. In 1903 he 
became State Superintendent of Schools, and continued in this 
position four years. In 1907 he was made superintendent of 
Knoxville City Schools, and in 1911 was elected President of the 
West Tennessee Normal College at Memphis. He died Septem- 
ber 17, 1913. 
ROBERT C. OGDEN. 
In the death of Robert C. Ogden the South has lost one of 
its truest friends and one of its most effective educational 
workers. For many years Mr. Ogden was the President and the 
inspiring genius for the Conference for Education in the South. 
His work through the annual meetings of the Conference, in the 
stimulation of public interest in education throughout the South, © 
will be regarded as the most notable Southern educational 
movement of the early years of the twentieth century. 
DR. JAMES KNOX POWERS. 
Dr. Powers was born in Lauderdale county, Alabama, Au- 
gust 15, 1851, and died in Florence August 15, 1913. He was 
an A. M. graduate of the University of Alabama in 1873, making 
the highest average ever made in that institution. His average 
in his senior year was 99.5. In 1888 he was elected President 
of the State Normal College at Florence, and served until 1892. 
He was editor of the Southern Educator, a journal later ac- 
quired by the Educational Exchange, and was identified with 
the organization of the Alabama Educational Association, of 
which he was at one time President. Dr. Powers was President 
of the State University from 1897 to 1901, and at the time of 
his death was President of the State Normal College at Flor- 
ence,
